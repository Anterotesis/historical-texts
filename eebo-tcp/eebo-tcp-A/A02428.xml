         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Aboundance of meat is called of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians <hi>Pleſmone;</hi> of the Latines <hi>Sacietas:</hi> wher we are to note, that ſome interpreters tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate verie ill, for <hi>Pleſmone, repletio:</hi> as in the ſecond ofthe Aphoriſmes. <hi>Aphoriſ. 22.

               <p>Abundance of meat, called of the Latines <hi>Satietas,</hi> is alſo two-fold, according to <hi>Galen</hi> in his 2. booke of Aphoriſines, <hi>Comen. 17.</hi> One according to the great largenes or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie of the veines or veſſels called of the Latines <hi>quo ad vaſa:</hi> as when ſuch abundance of meat is receiued, as thereby the ſtomacke is ouerſtretched: the other abundance is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to natures ſtrength, called <hi>quo ad vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res:</hi> as when more meate is eaten, then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures force can well ouercome.</p>
               <p>Abundance of humors is alſo of two ſorts. One of all the humors called in Greeke <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thos</hi> or <hi>plethora:</hi> in Latine <hi>plenitudo,</hi> or <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo:</hi> whereof <hi>Galen</hi> writeth in his <hi>13.</hi> booke. <hi>Metho. cap. 6. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biautem aequaliter inter ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucci ad aucti ſunt, idem plethos &amp; plethoram Graecivocant, nos ſuccerum plenitudinem ſeu redundantiam dicimus.</hi> VVhen as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are equally increaſed betweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that the Grecians cal <hi>plethos</hi> or <hi>pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi> we call it, abundance of humors. Now whereas <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith in his <hi>2.</hi> booke <hi>de Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſi. Medic. ſecundum locos, cap. 1.</hi> That to be abundance of humors, when onely bloud is increaſed: wee are to vnderſtand that bloud there ſignifieth impure bloud, &amp; ſuch as is mixt with other humors, called bloud, of that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3763:10"/>
which principaly there aboundeth. For it can not be, that only pure &amp; good bloud ſhould be conteined in the veines, without ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of choller, flewme or Melancholie: which muſt be ſo likewiſe vnderſtood, where it is ſaide that any other humor aboundeth, the ſame is not pure alone without mixture of othets, but that humor ioyned with others aboundeth in the veſſels.</p>
               <p>The ſecond abundance of humors, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Greeke <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> in Latine <hi>Vitium ſucci,</hi> or <hi>vitioſus ſuccus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>Plenitude or fulneſſe of humors, is alſo two-fold: one in regard of natures ſtrength, called <hi>Quo ad vires</hi> or <hi>virtutem:</hi> which is, when the humors ſo abounde, that they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and much grieue the naturall forces
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3763:11"/>
of the body. And although there be not ſuch aboundance of bloud in this fulnes <hi>quae ad vires,</hi> as is in the other <hi>quo ad vaſa:</hi> yet thoſe humors which are in the body, oppreſſe the powers of nature, whereupon nature being oppreſſed and not able to gouerne thoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors: they being as it were forſaken of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, loſe their goodnes, and offorce putrifie. And of this fulneſſe theſe are the ſignes: heauines, ſtretchings, a ſenſible werines, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a feeling like an vlcer: of which <hi>Galen</hi> ſayeth <hi>2. Aphoriſ. Aphoriſ. 5. Spontaneae laſsitudines morbos praenunciant:</hi> Voluntarie wearines forſheweth diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond fulnes of humors called <hi>Quae ad vaſa</hi> is, when there is ſuch aboundance of humors or of bloud; that the veines and veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are greatly extended or ſtretched: ſo that it is to be feared, leaſt the veines themſelues breake. And therefore <hi>Hippo</hi> in the firſte booke of Aphoriſines: <hi>Aphoriſ. 3.</hi> woulde haue in wreſtlers this dangerous fulnes ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily euacuated, that the bodie might begin againe to be nouriſhed. And this plenitude <hi>quae ad vaſa</hi> is either of pure bloud only, or of all humors with the bloud. And this fulneſſe hath theſe markes: redneſſe of color, ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, veines full &amp; ſtretched. Of theſe two Plenitudes and their ſignes ſpeaketh <hi>Galen</hi> in his booke <hi>De Plenitudine,</hi> reckoning vp
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3763:11"/>
theſe markes: ſwelling and ſtretching of the veines, redneſſe, lumpiſhnes of the bodie, a ſlouthfulneſſe in motion of the bodily mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Alſo <hi>Method. 9. Cap. 5.</hi> He reckoneth theſe ſignes of repletion <hi>quo ad vaſa:</hi> obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſtretchings, ſwelling &amp; redneſſe: Of this twofold, read <hi>Auicen, Secunda primi doct. tertia. cap. 3.</hi> Alſo <hi>Galen</hi> in his booke <hi>De Plenitu. &amp; Metho. 9.

               </p>
               <p>Becauſe theſe pointes taken out of the bookes of auncient learned Phiſicions, may ſeeme as yet hard to the vnskilfuller ſort, that yet raſhly and without skill or regarde of theſe things vſe the practiſe of letting bloud: It will not be loſt labour in my poore iudgement, with more plaine wordes to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate their ſayings, if it may be, to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of all men that are this way ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and yet want the helpe of the Latine tongue &amp; Latine writers.</p>
               <p>It appeareth by the premiſſes what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion is, <hi>vz,</hi> a ſuperfluous aboundance of humors in mans body, which happeneth two waies, either in quantitie or in qualitie.</p>
               <p>VVe may alſo learne, that repletion in quantitie, is when the foure humors are more in aboundance than is proportionable to the bodie that conteineth them, or when one hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor much exceedeth the reſt in quantitie:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3763:12"/>
For the bloud contained in the veines is not ſimple, or of one kind, as hath beene ſaid; but conſiſteth of flewme, blacke &amp; yellow cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and pure bloud mingled together, which humors notwithſtanding ſo mingled, by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon agreement and continuall vſe of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: we commonly call bloud.</p>
               <p>The iuſt and agreable proportion of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors is this: That in a man throughly health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; of good temperature: there is leſſe ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low choler than Melancoly: leſſe Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coly than flewme: leſſe flewme than pure bloud: ſo that that bloud is accounted beſt, not that hath like proportion of all humors, but ſuch an equalitie of the foure, as hath beene now ſpecified.</p>
               <p>Bloud therfore faulteth in quantitie when the humors being ſetled in a iuſt proportion, do paſſe and exceede the agreable meaſure of Nature: for then the whole frame of the bodie ſwelleth; the veines aboue meaſure are ſtretched, and all the members, ſpecially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any exerciſe, are wonderfully retched. This conſtitution of humors, though they be good, yet it faulteth, beclauſe it is come to an immoderate abundance, which accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably is wont to bring great perill. VVhether therefore there be in the bodie abundance of other humors aboue the bloud, ſo that the equabilitie of the proportion be not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3763:12"/>
that waie: or that there be too much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of pure bloud. Yet becauſe the pure bloud in the permixtion greatly excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the other humors; it is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ault not in the qualitie but only in the quantitie: and therfore both of theſe are conteined vnder this kinde of repletion in quantitie: and this is ſimply, abſolutely, moſt properly, &amp; commonly iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged repletion, &amp; is called <hi>Plenitudo ad vaſa,</hi> as is aforeſaid, becauſe it doth throughly fill the large capacitie of the veines, which are termed the veſſels or receptacles of the body, though it enforce not the powers therof. Firſt therefore, where al the humors ſuperfluouſly increaſe, filling &amp; extending the receptories of the bodie, as the ſtomacke, the veines, and the bowels: It is moſt properly called in Engliſh fulneſſe or repletion in Latine <hi>ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudo,</hi> in Greeke <hi>Plethora</hi> as before.</p>
               <p>Repletion in qualitie; is when the bloud or other humor is hotter or colder, thicker or thinner than is conuenient to the bodie. This is the ſeconde kinde of repletion, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the foreſaide auucient writers in Phiſicke, and which is referred to the force, ſtrength and abilitie of the bodie.</p>
               <p>In this repletion, although the veſſels of the bodie be not ſo much puffed vp, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſwell, as in the other: yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine more good bloud and nouriſhment
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3763:13"/>
than the nature of the patient can wel rule or ouercome: For a litle nouriſhment to a weak nature, is often troubleſome and grieuous: and although at the firſt it be right good; yet it doth not long ſo continue: but being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of the bodily heat, as not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct the ſame: in protract of time and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of daies, it corrupteth and becommeth the cauſes of diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>This conſtitution of the Greekes, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> is when the bodie is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farced either with choler yelow or black, or with flewme, or with watrie humors, and of late writers is thus defined: <hi>Cacochymia est vitioſa humoris qualitas, qua is a iuſta medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critase deſciſcit: Cacochymia</hi> is a corrupted qualitie of the humors, by reaſon whereof the humor departeth from his iuſt mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Vnder which <hi>Cacochymia</hi> is contained all corruption of humors in qualitie: wherby the powers of the bodie are hindred from their proper functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wherby alſo the whole bodie waxethfilthie &amp; daily decayeth.</p>
               <p>Of this corruption of humors in qualitie, one kind is ſomewhat better and more tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: as namely, when either ſuperfluous humors are exceſsiuely heaped vp together; or when the humors mixt with the bloud, do not keepe their iuſt and naturall concord or proportion: the other kind is worſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3763:13"/>
when the ſuperfluous humors or iuces in the bodie, both <hi>primi &amp; ſecundarii,</hi> both the principal humors, and theſe next the principall are fallen into corruption, from their naturall and conuenient temperature, which is the deſtruction and corruption ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſubſtance or of the temperament. Againe both theſe happen ſometime with rottennes and putrifaction, ſometime with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. VVhere note, moreouer that the name <hi>Cachochymia</hi> largely taken, comprehendeth alſo the corruption of the excrements. <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates Aphoriſ. 15.</hi> ſaith, where meate is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued much aboue nature, it cauſeth ſicknes. <hi>Galon</hi> in his Commentaries declaring that place ſaith, more meate then accordeth with natures meaſure, is named <hi>Replecion.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward hee expoundeth that worde aboue nature, to ſignifie too much and ſuperfluouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: As who would ſay, where the meate is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluouſly taken, it cauſeth ſickenes. Meate but a little exceeding doth not forthwith cauſe diſeaſes, but may yet keepe the bodie within the bounds of health, for meat ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring ſickenes muſt not a little, but much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede the exquiſite meaſure.</p>

               <p>Thus much harme commeth to the body by too much nouriſhment, and although the ſtomacke doo his Office in concoction, yet
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3763:15"/>
the veins too abondantly filled, are ſpred out, diuided, ſtopped and ſtuffed with winde, and greatly grieued. It is apparant that of repleci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fulnes of the veines (then the which in diſeaſes a more hurtfull thing cannot chance) diuers infirmities doo come, and the replecion of the belly, though the exceſſe may be expelled by vomit or ſedge, and ſo is more tollerable than fulneſſe of the veines: yet it is likewiſe to bee diſallowed. If a man haue at any time too much ingorged himſelfe by and by he may aſſay to vomit: for though hee doo well digeſt it, yet there is ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, leſt the veines be oppreſſed with fulnes: eſpecially when the party continually liueth intemperately, neuer regarding or minding euacuation. It is good therefore to vomit firſt, before the meates bee corrupted in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, if any impediment hinder vomiting, a ſedge by ſtoole is a preſent helpe. If neither ſerue, ſleepe long, and oft in drinke vſe warme water. VVhen the ſurfet is ſufficiently dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted chiefly by ſedge, it is expedient to waſh and vſe fomentations. i. plaiſters mittigating paine, and a little to taſt of ſalt meates, and to drinke wine or beare alaid or tempered with water. Theſe things by the way touching re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for ſurfetting, which in our daies is too vſuall, to the great diſhonour of God, and the certaine deſtruction of our bodies, yea,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3763:15"/>
and of our ſoules alſo, if GOD grantvs not grace ſpeedily to repent and amend. But if neither ſiege, nor timely digeſtion of the meate recemed, doo not inſue our ſurfettings; then the ſignes of replecion are to be looked for, which are ſet downe by <hi>Oribaſius Eupo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. lib. 1.</hi> which are theſe that followe: as Loſſe of appetite, delight in nothing, ſloughthfulnes, dulnes of wit and ſenſes, more ſleepe than was accuſtomed, crampes in the bodie, ſtarting of the members, fulneſſe of the veines, thickenes of the pulſies, horror and ſhroueling of the bodie mixt with heate.</p>
               <p>But the generall ſignes of abundance of bloud are theſe: bleeding at the noſe chiefly forth of the right noſthrill, ſpitting of bloud, veines full and great, chiefly in the face, red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of colour, a ponderous waightines of the whole body vnapt to any motion, an vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed drowſines, a ſluggiſhnes of minde without any euident cauſe, the skinne ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, pulſes very full, debilitie of ſight, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous dreames, plenty of ſweete ſpittle in the mouth, ſwellings and bluſhings in the face, heauines and painefull wearines in the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as it were after labour or bearing great burthens, vrine thicke and red.

               <p>And thus I conclude this firſt Chapter containing the chiefeſt and principall points concerning Fulneſſe, Emptineſſe, and their diuiſions.

yeallow choler in his proper coffer, namely the gall. Melancholy in the Spleene: The iuces are conuerted into the ſubſtance of the body, nouriſhing the ſame: Of this kind are thoſe iuces whereof the bloud is compact, &amp; thoſe otherwiſe called <hi>ſecundarii humores.</hi> Nowe each of theſe are ſometime agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to nature, ſometime repugnant to nature. They are agreeable to nature, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the right quality and quantity, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the law of nature for conſeruation of health. They are repugnant to nature, when they keepe meaſure neither in quality nor quantity. And therefore whatſoeuer of theſe manifeſtly departeth from the iuſt meane and meaſure which nature hath appointed, (becauſe it is the cauſe of ſickenes) if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it cannot be amended, it is altogether to be taken away and expelled, the expulſion whereof is called Euacuation.</p>
               <p>The differences of Euacuations are to bee taken of the ſcituation of the contents and corruptions, which are either <hi>Plethora</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chochymia</hi> as was ſhewed in the Chapter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.

               <p>Of Ordure are two ſortes, one digeſted which paſſeth by ſiege, the other vndigeſted expelled by vomit.

               <p>Humor ſuperfluous is of three ſorts either mixt with any of the foure Humors called naturall, or elſe it is gathered into the braine,

               <p>And that the way of Euacuation may bee the more eaſie: wee may deuide the body of man into three general Regions, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incloſed in their proper limits, haue not onely diuers receptories of ſuperfluities, but alſo diuers waies to purge the ſame.</p>
               <p>One and the firſt Region is extended from the meat pipe called <hi>Gula</hi> to the middle part of the Liuer, wherein are contained the maw, the ſtomacke, the <hi>venies Meſecaicae,</hi> as many as come to the entrance, the hollow or inner part of the Liuer, the Spleene, and <hi>Pancreas,</hi> that is, a thing betweene fleſh and kernel ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betweene the ſtomacke and the Liuer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:3763:19"/>
The 2. Region runneth from the middle of the Liuer, through the thin &amp; ſmall veines, of all and ſinguler partes, comprehending the outward part of the liuer, and euery hollowe veine and the greater artery placed by it, and vvhatſoeuer is betweene the Armehole and the flanks.</p>
               <p>The 3. Region comprehendeth the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the vppermoſt skinnes, the bones, and the whole maſſe of the body, which exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the very entrance and leſſer veines through euery part and the outmoſt skinne it ſelfe. Great is the diuerſity of theſe Regions, for ſo much as they are ſo incloſed within their owne limits, that there is betvveene them no fellowſhip at all. But the greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity is in their owne proper operations, hauing concoctions, excrements, and waies of purging diuers one from the other. By ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation and marking whereof vve ſhall the better proceede in Euacuation.</p>
               <p>Beſide theſe generall and vniuerſall Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the body: there are ſome more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and particular, hauing alſo excrements, yet not retching ſo far, nor following through the whole body, of which ſort are the braines, lungs, raines, and belly. Hereof are deriued tvvo differences of Euacuations: one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, the other particular. That is a generall Euacuation which draweth matter vniuerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3763:19"/>
from the vvhole body. Of this ſort are Svveate, Bleeding, Vomits, Euacuation, by ſiege. Each of theſe (thogh ſpecially &amp; for the moſt part they euacuate one Regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or part of the body. Yet theſe alſo empty other partes, though not ſo abundantly. As vomit firſt and chiefly euacuateth the ſtomacke, if it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long, it purgeth alſo the bovvels and the greater veines, laſt of all the ſtate of the whole body. Euacuation by ſiege or purging: chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and moſt of all purgeth the entrailes, ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, bowels, and the firſt veines, then the greater veines; Laſt of all the ſmall veines and the ſtate of the vvhole body. Opening a vaine firſt exhauſeth the veines and arteries ioyned vnto them: then the body and all the bovvels euen til it proceede to the firſt veins.

Again, of Euacuations, ſome are of their owne accord, ſome are done by Art. Naturall or voluntary Euacuation, is when any thing is expelled out of the body without any mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, this chanceth ſometime euen naturally: For nature while it is in health, rightly gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſtate of the body, and doth expell thence whatſoeuer ſuperſluouſly aboundeth or is corrupted; this Euacuation is both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and conuenient. This alſo chaunceth ſometime contrary to nature, as when the ſtrength of the body is ſo infeebled, that it cannot gouerne and reſtraine the Humors of the body, but letteth them quite flow forth: or when the vertue is ſtrong, yet it is ſomtime ſo prouoked either with abundance or acuity of the Humor, that it permitteth the Humor to paſſe of his owne accord out of the proper veſſels and receptories thereof: Both theſe are accidentall, vnprofitable, and beſides na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; becauſe the good bloud commeth forth mingled with the bad without choiſe or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3763:20"/>
Artificiall Euacuation is when the ſame commeth by outward help &amp; this is two fold.</p>
               <p>The one right profitable, onely Euacuating that which offendeth in iuſt quantity, &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The other contrary to this, extraordinary and vnprofitable, exhauſing the Humor that annoieth not, which commeth by the vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of the Phiſition.

               <head>What Phlebotomy is and from whence the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a vaine doth e uacuate. Chap. 3.</head>
               <p>FOR ſo much as the bloud in generall is mixed with the foure Humors which are alſo bedewed as it were with a thin watry ſubſtance, and that they all are ſo mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3763:21"/>
through the heat and concoction of the Liuer, that neuer an humor can be ſeene, neuer ſo little, to be ſeuered from the others therefore, I ſaie, the retentiue vertue cannot ſo ſtrongly hold back the bloud in the croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſmall veines when a great vaine is ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that with a ſufficient large wound: but the ſame will iſſue and come foorth. If by chaunce it happen that the retentiue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue go about gredily to ſuppreſſe the bloud, yet at length it will poure it out plentifully with oft handling &amp; rubbing of the veines. Neither doth this or that humor by it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone come foorth, as in purging: but bloud generally; that is to ſaie, mixt with other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in the veines.</p>
               <p>Touching the definition what it is: <hi>Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomia</hi> (which is worde for worde out of the Greeke, the cutting of a veine:) is an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall eduction of bloud, either abounding iu quantitie, or offending in qualitie, by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a veine. I call it an artificiall inciſion, becauſe it muſt not want art and iudgement: For in it, conſideration muſt be had of the inflicted wound: of the quantitie of the bloud: of chooſing the apteſt vaine: either to pull backe bloud, or to euacuate it quite: or to make it onely leſſe in quantitie. Alſo, for that conſideration is to be had, whether the veine muſt be opened ſtreight downe, or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3763:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ouerthwart, of the ſame ſide of the bodie, or of the other: with diuers conſiderations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, whereof we will ſpeake in their proper places. Therefore <hi>Phlebotomie</hi> which is one of the greateſt remedies, the Phiſition vſeth, is for good cauſe defined an artificiall kind of educing. <hi>Galen</hi> in his <hi>2. Aphoriſ. Coment. 17.</hi> defineth it to be an exquiſite euacuation of al the humors equally. <hi>Auicen</hi> defineth it <hi>vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſalem euacuationem, quae multitudinem hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morum euacuat:</hi> or thus <hi>Vena ſectio est vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalis euacuatio, quae anctionem humorum ſuper aequalitatem in venis exuperantium, euacuat. i.</hi> an vniuerſal euacuation which taketh away abundance of humors, repleniſhing the veines aboue meaſure.</p>
               <p>Though the bloud in the veines be in a moderate meane, or but little in quantitie, yet of the proper mouing, &amp; vehemencie of it ſelf it iſſueth out: nature litle or nothing at al pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding the ſame. <hi>Phlebotomie</hi> indifferently euacuateth both good &amp; bad humors contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the veines with the bloud. Neither in diſeaſes proceeding of corrupt conſtitution of humors, can nature ſo moderat the matter, as that, that humor alone ſhal flow forth that aboundeth in quantitie or offendeth in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. I confeſſe, that in the iudicials of diſeaſes, called <hi>Criſes,</hi> many times nature ſeparateth &amp; as it were, excludeth by wayes conuenient,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3763:22"/>

                  </gap>hſtanding, if then at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant we open a veine, nature cannot therby in ſo ſhort time expel the hurtfull humor.</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>Auicen</hi> ſaith, <hi>Phlebotomie</hi> eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth good bloud, the ill remaining behind, &amp; that he feareth, leſt opening a veine bring the patient, either to abundance of hot chollerik humors, or cruditie of flegmatike humors: if he mean it of the humors mixt in the veines, it is moſt falſ: for neither doth the watrie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor iſſue forth before choler, nor choler be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore flewme, or Melancoly, nor the bad hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor before the good. VVhich daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence proueth to be true: for when the bloud commeth forth, it appeareth ſimple &amp; of one forme: but in the porrenger it loſeth his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, &amp; euery part therof congeleth ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ine. Thinne choler &amp; the flowring part of the congealed bloud, is alſo aboue next the water. Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coly abideth in the bottom: the red bloud &amp; the paler flewme keepe in the middle region. So that opening of a veine euacuateth all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which are in the veines equally.</p>
               <p>VVe are here to ſet downe, from what place the evacuation is made: for, inaſmuch as bloud is moyſt and flowing: that firſt iſſueth forth which is next the opened veine,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3763:23"/>
then that which is next the ſame: thirdly, commeth foorth, not onely that which is in the veines and arteries, but alſo that which is in the bowels and whole habite of the body. For there is a wonderfull continuation and order of the veines, ſo that a way being once made, all the bloud often times floweth out of the bodie, and bringeth death to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But when the paſſage is ſtayed, then the bloud is ſent foorth by the veines &amp; arteries, till there be a certain proportion in the whole bodie: For the emptied and wanting partes by the long ſmall veines draw bloud forth of the full partes, &amp; repleated members; and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>or them, as it were in their need. Againe, the full members grieued with too much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance, vnburthen them-ſelues on the veines that are emptied. Againe, the humor being liquide and flowing voluntarily follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the lower euacuated regions, and there continueth: whereupon it followeth, that whenſoeuer bloudletting ſhall emptie the veines; the ſame alſo ſhall euacuat the whole bodie. In regard whereof <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> in the definition thereof, is called verie well an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall euacuation, and that for two cauſes. Firſt, becauſe it withdraweth all humors whereof the bloud conſiſteth. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it euacuateth from the whole bodie; but yet not in like ſort. Foraſmuch as the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3763:23"/>
partes of mans bodie are placed in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: therefore firſt it exhauſeth from the neere partes, then from thoſe that are further off. And againe, foraſmuch as ſome veines are ſpred into ſome partes of the bodie, and other into other partes: therefore bleeding with more celeritie and force draweth from thoſe partes which are rightly and directly placed, then from thoſe members, which are oppoſite or ouerthwart.</p>

But of theſe opinions neither is ſimply true, and yet both true, as the caſe may be limitted. And for the caſes wherein a gentle purgatiue is to proceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Phlebotomie:</hi> they are in number theſe ſixe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:3763:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Firſt, when the ſtomacke, the <hi>Meſecaicae</hi> veines, the great veines, &amp; the waies &amp; paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the bodie, or any of theſe be ſtuffed with filth, or incombred with crudities: or that the excrements are hardened in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, although the whole bodie abound with bloud beſide, yet a gentle &amp; eaſie receit is to be taken; as <hi>Manna, Caſsia</hi> or a cliſter (but no violent receit) which may euacuate from the foreſaid veines, &amp; open the obſtructed paſſages. If the bloud ſhould firſt be drawen forth without ſome gentle purgation or eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation in the greater veines: then the veines outwardly exhauſted by bleeding, through their attractiue vertue, would drawe vnto them ill iuces; ſpecially, if the diſeaſe require any plentiful bleeding. This is affirmed by <hi>Auicen &amp; Galen. 9. Metho. cap. 5.</hi> who did vſe to refraine from <hi>Phlebotomie,</hi> if there were cruditie of meat in the ſtomake, or rawnes in the veines called <hi>Meſecaicae,</hi> til their conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wer ended, &amp; the excreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts deſcended.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when the bloud is verie viſcous, clammie &amp; groſſe, we do not only take medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines attenuating, but alſo leſſening things &amp; a dyet conuenient to prepare bloud: and to make the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber bleed the better, vſe a bath: for oft it commeth to paſſe, that a veine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened, no bloud iſſueth forth, becauſe of the thicknes &amp; clammineſſe thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:3763:24"/>
Thirdly, it faleth out in many cholerike bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that choller contained in the vpper parte of the ſtomacke is eaſily moued, &amp; ſo boileth cauſing <hi>Lipothymia. i.</hi> ouercoming: in which caſe it behoueth to vſe before ſome Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue receit, &amp; alſo in bleeding to vſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to keepe backe the boiling of choller.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in diſeaſes wherein appeareth a difficultie by reaſon of <hi>Cacochymia</hi> or abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of other humors mixt with the bloud. When a practiſioner perceiueth that he muſt vſe <hi>Phlebotomie,</hi> &amp; yet with ſome difficultie; in this caſe he may vſe ſome eaſie purgation, or one of ſome force: whereby it may fall out that nature ſhal thereby ſo be eaſed (which the ſiege &amp; eaſe of nature wil ſhew thee) that thou ſhalt not need bleeding at all, but onely preparation of the matter, &amp; then to renue the educing thereof as before.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, remember <hi>Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cens</hi> ſaying: <hi>Sanguis fraenum cholerae existit:</hi> bloud is the reſtrainer of choler: therfore in diſeaſes mere cholerik, it were a raſh part to ſet bleeding before pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, which perhaps thou maiſt be without, after the exhibiting of the medicine. And if thou vſe the patient wel; let thoſe things ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which change or repell the ſharpnes of choller. Yet this is to be added, that if there ſhuld be ſuch abundance of choller as might cauſe a ſwelling aboue nature or inflamation; then bleding vpon that, is a preſent help.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:3763:25"/>
Sixthly, the ſame reaſon may ſerue in fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matike conſtitutions. Wherein for many cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (although no ſmall fulneſſe appeare) yet we are not to vſe <hi>Phlebotomie</hi> before pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</p>
               <p>The caſes wherein <hi>Phlebotomie</hi> precee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth purging are theſe. Firſt, when great ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes appeareth, which either hath cauſed, or is like to cauſe any vehement diſeaſe, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexia,</hi> which is a ſicknes engendred of groſſe humors, filling the receptories or veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the braine, and thereby depriuing the partie of feeling, ſpeach, and mouing: as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripleumonia,</hi> which is an inflamation or an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtume of the lungs, with a vehement Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, comming ſometime of it ſelfe, but moſt commonly following vpon great and ſharpe rewmes, ſquinances, pleuriſies, or ſuch like diſeaſes: as <hi>Suffocation;</hi> which is in Engliſh, ſtrangling: then &amp; in this caſe without faile, and chiefely if the wombe be laxatiue, vſe letting of bloud without precedent purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this ſeemeth to agree with <hi>Galen lib. 10. de Compoſi. medica. ſecundum locos, ca. 2</hi> VVhere he ſaith: if the bodie doe equally abound with humors: firſt let bloud &amp; then purge. And hereunto <hi>Auicen</hi> accordeth <hi>in quarta primi Cap. 4.</hi> This (ſaith he) is a truth, and the precepts of <hi>Hippocrates in lib. Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mionium:</hi> that if both bleeding and purging
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3763:25"/>
be neceſſarie, and that the purgatiue muſt be vehement, then begin with <hi>Phlebotomie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, in dangerous fluxes of bloud out of the noſe, or in ſpitting of bloud called <hi>Hoemoptoicapaſsio,</hi> or in bluddie fluxes: for to turne the matter a way in full bodies, wee preſently let bloud without medicine going before.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in wraſtlers abounding with bloud: to whom the ſame abundance threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſome great danger, &amp; that it is preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that there are no ill humors in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuite or compas of the bodie; in this caſe wee vſe <hi>Phlebotomie</hi> without purging.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we may ſafely let blond (without medicine) thoſe that are whole, &amp; for abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of bloud only, are accuſtomed to yere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleeding; and that haue in the yere taken little or no Phiſicke, as it chanceth to many perſons in many countries of the North.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we may open without purging, the inner vaine of the arme, in women with child, if they carrie <hi>Corpora Phletorica,</hi> full bodies, &amp; that in the 5. 6. or 7. moneth after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: yea &amp; alſo before they be quicke. This practiſe wee are to vſe ſpecially, when they being with child, waxe verie ſlowe, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, &amp; as it were, ouerladen with abundance of bloud, we may take <hi>Salua tella</hi> veine: or if plenitude ſo require; the inner veine of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3763:26"/>
arme: for the quantitie reſpecting a diſcreete moderation.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, we may let thoſe bloud without me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, that haue fallen from ſome high place, &amp; taken hurt in the breſt and ſtomacke, in whome is to be feared an inconuenience cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the Greekes <hi>Egchymoſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seuenthly, we ſpeedily let bloud ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, without further Phiſick, as by reaſon of their fulnes through ſome accident, as feare, or ſuch like, waxe domme; in which caſe wee let bloud abundantly, ſo that both armes are opened together.</p>
               <p>Here I am to note a great error in <hi>Auicen;</hi> both repugnant to trueth it ſelfe, and alſo contrarie to <hi>Galen:</hi> For <hi>Auicen</hi> affirmeth, that when colde and thicke humors are in the bodie: firſt wee muſt begin with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and then open a veine. Diuers and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies hath he erred in this. Firſt, becauſe in flegmatick humors, groſſe and colde mixt with bloud, hee woulde haue <hi>Phlebotomie</hi> not vſed before purging. And in this caſe, by all likelyhood of reaſon, the cure ſhould begin with bleeding. Secondly, in this hee diſſenteth from <hi>Galen,</hi> who <hi>11. Method. Chap. 4.</hi> though there were obſtructions in the bodie of thicke and clammie humors: yet firſt hee would begin the cure with <hi>Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

If <hi>Auicens</hi> meaning be, when flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike humors ouercome the bloud in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or abundance, that then wee muſt firſt vſe purging; then is hee greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, for as much as hee proponeth a caſe in which <hi>Phlebotomie</hi> ſhould not auaile, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with thoſe many colde humors there be alſo ſome exceſſe of bloud, which chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth verie ſildome or not at all. But it may ſeeme that <hi>Auicen</hi> hath reaſon, namely this: that the bloud being extracted; thoſe humors would waxe more rawe: and ſo by opening a veine, the patient is brought to a marueilous cruditie of colde humors. This is no reaſon: for by <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> wee detract bloud; not becauſe of obſtructions, cauſed of groſſe and colde humors, but becauſe bloud ſuperaboundeth. For the ſtopping is afterward remoued with other helpes.

               <p>
                  <hi>Schola Salerni,</hi> in two verſes reckoneth vp three effects of bleeding:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Exhilerat triſtes, iratos placat, amantes</l>
                  <l>Ne ſint amentes, Phlebotomia facit.</l>
                  <l>It ſwageth wrath, and cheeres the ſad:</l>
                  <l>Preſerues loue-ſick, from being mad.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>FIrſt, it maketh glad thoſe that are pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue. Secondly, it appeaſeth ſuch as are angrie. Anger is eſpecially cauſed through mixture of much yellow choler with bloud. And ſadneſſe, by commixture of much Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancoly with bloud. And foraſmuch as both theſe humors, choler &amp; Melancoly are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted with the bloud, theſe two effectes muſt conſequently follow. Thirdly, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth loue-ſicke perſons, from madneſſe, by drawing humors from the head to the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer partes, and ſo expelling the ſame.</p>
               <p>Although occaſion will hereafter better ſerue to ſhewe the cauſes why wee vſe Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy: yet here nowe ſpeaking of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes, I will briefely ſhewe fiue cauſes, for which wee vſe to let bloud, and by the which may be gathered the profitable effectes of this practiſe: of the which fiue cauſes; one
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3763:27"/>
onely cauſe is the direct, the other foure are indirect.</p>
               <p>The direct cauſe of bleeding is euacuation of the bloud. But foraſmuch as bloud is good for nature, therfore <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> muſt be vſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>duiſsdly: that the ſame bloud only may be expelled, which is vnprofitable &amp; hurtfull to nature. Bloud, as you haue partly heard, is made vnprofitable to nature two waies: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when it doth not throughly keepe the proper qualitie that it cannot ſo nouriſh as it did before when it was good: or when in quantitie it ſo increaſeth, that it either preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth downe the powers of the bodie, or ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth &amp; ſtoppeth both the veines &amp; the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: In theſe two caſes, bleeding is good, as one of the direct euacuating helpes. Yet in theſe caſes bleeding is not to be vſed indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, but with this difference: in abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of bloud, much may be detracted: In little plentie, ſmall euacuation ſerueth. Hereupon <hi>Galen</hi> writeth <hi>lib. 9. cap. 10. Method. Si ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis vitioſus in corpore fuerit, paulatim quod vitioſum eſt, euacuare oportet, &amp; paulatim ad in o icem quod ſalubre est, pro eo reponere.</hi> If corrupt bloud be in the bodie, wee muſt by little &amp; little take away the bad; and by litle &amp; litle procure in the place therof, that which is good: which way of curing or amending of corrupt bloud, the Phiſicions call in Greeke
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3763:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Epicraſis.</hi> And to this <hi>Alexander Tralleanus</hi> ſubſcribeth <hi>lib. 9. ca. 2.</hi> The reaſon why this is not to be done at once, is for that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of the bodie would relent &amp; giue ouer. And although that which is euacuated be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous: yet by a ſudden &amp; thorough mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it doth more hurt than good. It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therefore to emptie the bodie ſafely, and by little at once, than by making haſt, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch both the diſeaſe &amp; the partie diſeaſed.</p>
               <p>And here it appeareth, how much they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> which detract the ill bloud ſo long, til the good alſo begin to come: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it may fall out, that all the bloud will flowe forth of the bodie, before that the good will appeare. It behoueth therefore the euacuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be little. And (as <hi>Gaelen</hi> councelleth in this caſe) before the opening of a veine, to vſe <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picraſis. i.</hi> to giue the patient ſuch meat, as may cauſe good bloud; that good bloud may ſtill come in place of the bad: and then a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, more bloud may be taken. This therfore is called the direct bleeding, becauſe it is don of it ſelf, to euacuate that which by opening a veine ought in deede to be withdrawen: namely, multitude of humors &amp; of bloud, of bloud principally; &amp; of humors ſecondarily: in aſmuch as they are mingled with the blod. The other are called indirect cauſes: and are vſed only to reuoke or call backe the violent
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3763:28"/>
force of humors to the contrary part, or to turne the fluxe of them aſide another way.</p>
               <p>The firſt indirect cauſe is, for the greatnes of a diſeaſe, or for vehement inflamation of an impoſtume: for in apoſtumatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of great heat, in hote feuers, &amp; in vehement griefes, there is not found a more excellent remedie than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of a veine.</p>
               <p>The ſecond indirect cauſe is, to allure the matter to the place of euacuation. Therefore in ſtopping of Termes or Hemorroids, the veine <hi>Saphena</hi> is to be opened. Fulnes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming by ſuppreſsion of Termes is to be euacuated by the legges from the knee to the anckle, whether we cut a veine, or vſe ſcarifying, or launcing: for veines opened in the armes of weomen, reuoke &amp; draw vpward their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall purging.</p>
               <p>The third indirect cauſe is, that the humors may be turned to ſome other place, contrary or oppoſite to the place, vnto the which they flow of their own accord. Therfore in immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat fluxe of Termes, we open the <hi>Baſilica</hi> veine, that is the inward veine of the arme, which is alſo called <hi>Hepatitis;</hi> that the matter being called to a contrarie place, may be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from his fluxe.</p>
               <p>The fourth indirect cauſe is, that ſome part of the matter being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away by bleeding; nature may the more eaſily ouercom, the reſt:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3763:29"/>
For the vertue of the bodie being weaker, then that it can rule ſuch aboundance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, wee take away by bleeding ſome por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, leaſt thorough impotencie and debilitie of nature, the ſame humors ſhould flowe to the weaker members, and there breede apoſtumations, and ſwellings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to nature. But of this more ſhal be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at large in the proper place therof, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Chapter of reuulſion and deriuation of plucking backe, and turning aſide of the bloud &amp; of humors.</p>
               <p>Touching the vtilitie of bleeding: great is the profit therof: For <hi>Galen</hi> reporteth that therewith he hath oft cured feuers: and that it is boldly to be taken in hand when neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie requireth it. Therfore we may worthily blame thoſe, which in our time, contrarie to <hi>Galens</hi> iudgement, &amp; againſt reaſon &amp; al ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, ſpeak euil of this profitable practiſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it ſharpeneth the ſight, making the ſame more cleare: the reaſon thereof is, for that it diminiſheth thoſe humors which tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough their fumes, hinder the clearnes of the eies: ſo that conſequently the ſight thereby is ſharpened.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it purgeth the braine, &amp; ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the wit, by the foreſaid reaſon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it heateth the marrow, waſting thoſe ſuperfluous humors, by whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3763:29"/>
&amp; flowing the marrow in the bones waxeth cold.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it purifieth all the ſenſes, taking away thoſe fumes and euaporations, which aſcend vp to the head, and there trouble the ſenſes.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, it purgeth the bowels and entrailes: The reaſon is, becauſe nature gouerning the body, being disburdened of that bloud which was (as it were) an oppreſſion to nature, and greued her (as it were) with ſome heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: doth now with eaſe concoct and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rawe and rude humors deteined in the bowels.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, it ſtayeth vomits and laskes: for it draweth the humors from the inwarde parts, to the outward parts. VVherevnto <hi>Auicen</hi> agreeth writing thus, <hi>Phlebotomia propteriae quod ad diuerſum trahit, naturam ſecundum plurimum retinet. Phlebotomy,</hi> becauſe it draweth to the contrary part, therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it reteineth nature. In which place it is to be vnderſtood that in fluxes of the womb, the veine of the Arme is to be taken, which preſently helpeth: But if you doo otherwiſe, that is, take the veine in the foote, or legge, it profiteth nothing. Sometime it chanceth that the belly by opening of a veine is more flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than before, and that eſpecially chanceth two waies: firſt becauſe nature being disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3763:30"/>
by bleeding, ſtrength is increaſed: ſo that ſometime it ſtirreth vp other euacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as namely by ſiege. The ſecond way is when through imbecility of the retentiue vertue, which imbecility by opening of a veyne is increaſed, ſo that the wombe is more ſtirred and prouoked.</p>
               <p>Seauenthly, it profiteth againſt immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate watching, for it emptieth abundance of humors, from the which commonly diuers ſharpe fumes aſcend vp to the head and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſleepe.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, it taketh away heauines, ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; wearines of the body. For, as hath bin already ſaid before, bleeding disburdeneth nature, which ruleth our bodies of multitude of humors; which before was preſſed downe by them &amp; oppreſſed with them. And again, Melancholly, the chiefeſt cauſe of heauines, is expelled with the bloud, as the dregs and grounds thereof.</p>
               <p>Ninethly, it cureth difficulty of hearing, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating abundance of humors whoſe thicke &amp; ſlatuous ſpirits, carried vpward into the head, ſtop the hearing port and paſſege of the eares.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, it helpeth the voice, taking away ſuperfluous humidi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:3763:30"/>
Eleuenthly, it refreſheth and increaſeth the powers and ſtrength of the body: For the body beeing freed from a multitude of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, muſt of neceſſity haue the vertue and ſtrength thereof augmented. Theſe commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of bleeding, are thus ſet downe in verſe by <hi>Schola Salerni.</hi>

foorth which thing <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſeth in his booke <hi>de Scarrificatione:</hi> ſaying, to open a veine oft in the yeare, I iudge not profitable: for with much bloud the vitall ſpirits are alſo exhaled: which beeing done too often, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the whole body, making the ſame cold, and cauſing the liuely operations thereof, to waxe worſe and worſe. To frequent blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therefore bringeth on old age apace, and maketh the ſame ſubiect to many diſeaſes, as the dropſie, gowt, ſhakings, palſies, falling ſickeneſſes, and apoplexies.

               <p>REvulſion is a prouided remedy for bloud flowing out of the noſe or belly,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3763:32"/>
or that floweth to any part like them to cauſe inflammation. It is called in the Greek <hi>Antiſpaſis:</hi> That is, a turning to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way: in Latine <hi>Reuulſio,</hi> that is, a pulling backe; and as the word impotteth, ſo is it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſined, a drawing of the running humor into the contrary part. Nothing can more ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely keepe backe the force of a Fluxe than this practiſe. Now for to vnderſtand which is the contrary part, we muſt note that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks call thoſe contraries, which be the extremities of one and the ſelfe ſame ſtraight line, which ſtand furtheſt off in a ſtraight pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding or going forth of the ſelfe ſame vein; through whoſe paſſages the humors haue their courſe. For a veyne beeing opened, firſt the part next the wound is euacuated; &amp; that euacuated part draweth the bloud out of the further part. And foraſmuch as opening of a veine doth thus euacuate (through the helpe of the ſmall ſtraight veynes which nature hath ordained to allure and draw, as ſhee hath the ouerthwart veynes to expell:) The ſame opening of a veyne (I ſay) will prouoke more bloud and in ſhorter time from thoſe parts where the ſtreight veynes are ſpread then from the reſt. Yea, if the veynes drawe not at all, yet the humors voluntarily will flowe in the ſtraight courſe of the veynes: they that are in the right parts, followe the right mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3763:32"/>
and they that are in the left partes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the left members: and that courſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors is commended, which are carryed ſtraight wiſe; and that diſcommended when they are carried crookedly and ouerthwart, as declaring nature to bee violated and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. The names of Phiſicall contraries in this practiſe are theſe: before, behinde, the right, the left, vpward, downewarde, within, without. Neither are theſe contraries in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion of humors, except they bee ſo placed in a ſtraight courſe of veines. For the left ſide is not contrary to a left Plureſie, or the left leg, from the knee downewarde, called in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine <hi>Crus,</hi> contrary to the right leg inflamed. For herein this is a common and direct ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of veines, whereby the left leg beeing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, draweth from the right: But from the right ſide to the left no veyne commeth with ſtraight and right ſtrings: Therefore a veyne opened in the ſame remoueth not a Plureſie on the right ſide: But either leaueth the hurtfull humor in the inflamed part, or min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth it with the pure bloud, or bringeth a Plureſie in the left ſide: which often falleth out ſo.</p>
               <p>For as much therefore as all our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours and deuiſes muſt tende, by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a veyne, to exhauſt bloud abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly and ſpeedely from the inflamed part:

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely doth the Phiſition open the inner veine of the right arme in a plureſie on the right ſide, but alſo in inflammation of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: and yet all the veins are ioyned to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in felowſhip.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ena humeralis,</hi> rather than to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner veine of the left arme; attributing ſo much to thoſe veynes which are directly and ſtraightly ſcytuated. Therefore Revulſion in a ſtreight courſe bringeth euident and ſpeedy helpe, whereas in a crooked or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart locution it bringeth none at all.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, a large veyne opened, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth bloud plentifully and ſpeedely from the next places. Therefore when there is a great and vehement inflammation of ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Humor, abundantly concurring in ſome principall member, and part of great ſenſe and feeling: a large veine muſt be opened in ſome neere place vnto it: which may abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly and ſpeedely euacuate from the place affected. If the infirmity be but ſmall, a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer veyne may be choſen, and in a place fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtant, to euacuate a leſſe quantity, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3763:33"/>
at more leyſure. Revulſion in this ſort, not onely ſtayeth the Fluxe, but alſo exhauſteth firſt from the affected member the rotten and ill bloud, before it deale with the good bloud of the other parts and members of the body, and then all feare is remooued of any newe Fluxe to inſue. For when the part affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ct ed ſhall bee disburdened more than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, through great euacuation lately made, very hardly in reaſon, can the ſame be grieued with another Fluxe of humors, except we go on with a freſh intemperate order of liuing. And againe, the members far diſtant (coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous as it were) becauſe of their great want: wil not ſuffer the bloud in them contained, to flow to the others. Neither will the member affected (except there remaine in the ſame great dolor and heate) allure or ſucke any thing from them, being now but weake and conſequently not requiring great nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The opinion therefore of the <hi>Arabians</hi> concerning opening of a veyne muſt needes be falſe: VVho ſuppoſe that in a Plureſie a veyne opened on the ſame ſide doth increaſe the force of the Fluxe. Affirming alſo that for the plenitude (if it be much) leſt the Flux ſhould increaſe, the ſame is to bee taken from the lower veyne of the foote. After this that the Revulſion muſt bee made from the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3763:34"/>
inner veyne of the contrary arme. Laſt of all, that the reliques and remainder is to bee euacuated out of the ſame ſide. VVhat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion I pray you is this? ſo oft to vexe the ſicke Patient, whom wee may cure at one time: For bloud abundantly taken out of the ſide affected, draweth plenty as it were at the well head, freeing that part from inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without ſuſpition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> orfeare of any newe Fluxe. Euacuation made from the ouerthwart veynes, onely abateth ſuperfluity of bloud and humors, with ſmall quantity of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt bloud, and leſſe eaſe to the pained part: Or els the corrupted bloud remooued from the affected member, is mingled in the veyns with the good bloud, and ſo the euill that was to be remedied, is made worſe. VVhen a veyne is opened in a right and ſtraight courſe <hi>(e directo</hi> as they call it) it both euacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth, pulleth the humor backe, and turneth it aſide. And as a ſlowe and continuall run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, doth moſt ſafely pull backe from the furtheſt partes, and remooue a fluxe that might poſſibly inſue: So alſo the bloud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned into a long tract, as it were of a new way, by litle and litle with Revulſion: it turneth from the old courſe, without offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the naturall powers any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Now that this Reuulſion, or calling backe of flowing humors to the contrary part: may
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3763:34"/>
be practiſed with the greater profit; I am to giue here aduertiſement, that foure conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are therein to bee reſpected, as <hi>Auicen</hi> ſetteth downe in <hi>quarta primi cap. 1.</hi> Firſt we are to conſider the diuerſity of the member, and ſtill to draw to the contrary part, as from the right part to the left, from the lower member to the hyer, from before to behinde, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This conſideration to bee very needfull, <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> prooueth by experience: For <hi>5. Aphoriſ. Apho. 68.</hi> hee writeth that paine in the binder part of the head, is cured by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening a veyne in the forehead: which <hi>Hyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> practiſed to auert the matter as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> noteth in the Commentary. This auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or turning to the contrary is done either according to longitude, that is, aboue and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe: or latitude, that is, from the right to the left, or according to the altitude, that is, before and behind.</p>
               <p>The ſecond condition is to haue a care of the fellowſhip and community of the veyns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore in abundant fluxe of termes, wee pull backe, applying the Cupping-glaſſes to the Paps. VVhich <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> moſt learnedly witneſſeth <hi>5. Aphoriſ. Aphor. 50.</hi> For there is a kind of Affinite betweene the veynes of the wombe and the veynes of the Paps.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:3763:35"/>
Thirdly, care muſt be had of the rightnes and ſtraightnes of the veynes, which care be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had great profit inſueth.</p>
               <p>The fourth condition is, to obſerue the farnes of the diſtance. But of theſe, two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions eſpecially are to be obſerued. That is to ſay, the fellowſhip of the veynes, with their rectitude or rightnes: And therefore <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> counſelleth to open the inner veyne of the ſame ſide or arme, and not of the contrary arme. VVhich alſo <hi>Galen</hi> affirmeth, <hi>li. de cura. ratio. ſanguinis miſſione ca. 16.</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer <hi>Auicen</hi> would otherwiſe, <hi>in tertia primi.</hi> Therefore they are to be blamed that in a Plureſie of the right ſide, open a veyne in the left<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth, <hi>lib. artis medic. cap. 95.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are three waies of auerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or turning away and a ſide of humors called <hi>Deriuatio.</hi> One by repelling things that beat backe the matter, another by thinges reuelling, which pull the matter cleane away, and draw it forth to the contrary part. And the third way is, by thinges tranſmiſſiue, which ſende the matter from one member to another. So <hi>Diuerſio,</hi> or <hi>Deriuatio</hi> is as it were <hi>genus</hi> to Revulſion. If therefore (as yee haue heard) there be great inflammation, or a ſodaine and haſty Fluxe of humors; open a great veyne of the ſame ſide might, <hi>e d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3763:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great or large veyne becauſe if the euacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be in the greater veſſels, it is done with the more ſpeede: As <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, <hi>libri primi arti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> medic. cap. 95.</hi> And it is ſaide rightly in the ſame ſide, for this is the counſaile of <hi>Galen, lib. 13. Metho. cap. 11.</hi> But if the Fluxe of humors be ſlowe, &amp; not haſty as in the other, or that a veyne muſt be opened for preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely: A veyne further off may bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken according to the iudgement and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Phiſition, as ye haue partly heard before.</p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as the Liuer is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and originall of all the veynes, and <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> cuacuateth bloud, it ſeemeth that bloud ſhould neuer be abated, either for Euacuation or Revulſion, vnleſſe the veyne of the right arme bee taken, which chiefly doth euacuate and pull backe from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that is, the Liuer. VVhich alſo may be prooued by that notable man <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> his authority, affirming our whole body to be <hi>Conſpirabile:</hi> That is, of one agreement, and of a common and generall accorde together, one member with another, and <hi>Confluxibile,</hi> that is, alwaies running together, and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied, that each part thereof ſuffereth with the other.</p>
               <p>This beeing ſo, it ſeemeth that rectitude is not at all to be regarded in Revulſion. For
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3763:36"/>
what veyne ſoeuer wee open becauſe of the conſent of the whole body with the parts the like profit will inſue.</p>
               <p>For the Solution hereof we make anſwere: that as it is now ſaid, it would follow in effect. But that nature a prouident dame hath ſo placed the midriffe, as it diuideth the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke from the lower bowels, and hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated the right parts from the left: Leſt one part being hurt, the other part ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſodainely periſh. And this is the cauſe that therefore rather the right with right, than with the left; and the left with the left, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the right, doo accord together, and mutually ſuffer one with the other. And therefore alſo <hi>Hyppacrates</hi> ſaid well. <hi>Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis reuulſionem ſecundum rectitudinem (cat a Ixin) fieri debere.</hi> That Revultion of bloud muſt bee done according vnto rectitude. If therefore a veyne be thus opened wee ſhall ſoone ſee the apparant vtility, if wee doo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe or the contrary, it profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>This is ſeene euen by naturall eruptions of bloud: For if in ſwelling of the Spleene, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expell bloud out of the right Noſthrill, or in ſwelling of the Liuer from the left No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthrill, no helpe inſueth. But if the bleeding bee according to rectitude called in Greeke <hi>Cata Ixin,</hi> as ſpeniticke perſons, out of the

left Noſthrill: and in diſeaſes of the Liuer out of the right euident profit will appeare. The contrary profiteth not, but oft hurteth diminiſhing the ſtrength of the body without helpe to the diſeaſe, as ſaith <hi>Galen de curand. rati. per ſang. miſſio. cap. 15.</hi> VVherefore as it were following nature, in that which ſhee doth well, and thoſe thinges which come vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, and of themſelues, and are yet good and profitable to ſtoppe bleeding at the noſe from the left Noſthrill, wee apply cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes to the left <hi>Hypocondrium:</hi> which is the compaſſe of the ſide neere the breaſt and Paps, and if from the right Noſthril, to the right <hi>Hypocondrium.</hi> The rectitude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as an eſpeciall matter is to bee obſerued in Revulſion: yea, and more account is to bee made thereof, than of the differences of the members, neither are the parts of the body to bee iudged contrary each to other, except one bee oppoſite to the other according to rectitude.</p>

                     <hi>Auicen in 4. primi. 1.</hi> deliuereth two rules not to be neglected in Revulſions. Firſt that if in the member, from which wee will pull backe, there bee great paine: the paine muſt be aſſwaged, before we make Revulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Otherwiſe, the dolour greatly attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, and wee alſo drawing backe with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, the humors to ſome other part, there would bee too great a contention, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue moouing of the matter: whereby the body might receiue much hurt.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond rule is, that when wee pull backe, the paſſage muſt not bee thwart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny principall member. If any ambiguity ariſe concerning this rule, becauſe <hi>Hyppocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> is ſaide before, in ach of the hinder part of the head, to open a veyne in the forepart: we anſwere, that the ſame paſſage was not made vpon a principall member, to wit, the braine. VVe alſo affirme that the paſſage may be by a veyn of a principall member, though not by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3763:37"/>

In a pleuriſie of the right ſide, open a veine in the right arme: otherwiſe, the hart being ſituate in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, betweene the right ſide and the left: the paſſage ſhould be vpon a principall member, namely the heart. And hitherto chiefeiy of Revulſion.</p>

                     <hi>Parocheteuſis</hi> in Greeke: <hi>Deriuatio</hi> in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine: in Engliſh, Deriuation, or pulling aſide; is defined, a drawing of the flowing humor to the next part. It is done by opening that vaine which is found in the verie member af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; and whereby alſo ſometime that member receiued nouriſhment. But now the ill iuce flowing, and that veine opened, the grieued part is preſently disburthened.</p>
                  <p>This practiſe is profitably vſed after reuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: In the beginning of inflammation, when the matter is now in fluxio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; mouing, bloud is to be withdrawen from ſome farre diſtant place, according to rectitude: after that, euacuation muſt be made from the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected part, when the matter is come thither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there ſettleth and abideth: then detract
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3763:38"/>
bloud, either from the affected part, or verie neere vnto it, and this is called <hi>Parocheteuſis, deriuatio.</hi> VVee make deriuation from the member affected, when the ſame is not any noble or principall member: and this is done two wayes: either manifeſtly and ſenſibly by ſcarification or boxing: or immanifeſtly by euaporation, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſheweth, <hi>lib. Artis Med. cap. 95.</hi> But that deduction which is made to the next partes, is moſt properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Deriuation.

So in <hi>angina,</hi> opening the veines in the handes, and the veines vnder the toung, wee make deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to the next place. So in affectes of the guttes, we do not prouoke to ſtole, but draw it to the next partes: prouoking either vrine or ſwet.

                  <p>You haue heard before, that deriuaſion is vſed after revulſion, when the force of the fluxe is ſtayed, when the heat of the inflammation is layde, when there is no feare or ſuſpicion of any other inflammation likely to enſue: and alſo when the humor is yet moyſt and liquide in the member, from whence it may returne.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3763:40"/>
way to euacuate bloud, than medicine: for <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> euacuateth all humors at once, &amp; principally the bloud which moſt of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth in the veines: and this thing, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine cannot do. Againe, euacuation is done for two cauſes: either for to remooue the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of the humor, or to take away the corrupted qualitie of the homor. So euacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bloud is practiſed, either becauſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth in quantitie, or offendeth in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. If we open a veine becauſe bloud aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in quantitie: then in like ſort there is alſo abundance of other humors.

Therefore when bloud thus aboundeth in quantitie with other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, it is better to euacuat them by <hi>Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie</hi> than by receit. If euacuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of bloud be made for that it corrupteth in the veines, then by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it corrupteth the other humors alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing bloud is more abounding in quantitie than are the other humors: wherupon <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that in the feuer <hi>Sinocha,</hi> there is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the humors, &amp; in all the veines, &amp; therefore bloud is neuer to be euacuated without the other humors together. Now o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humors may ſuperfluouſly abound &amp; be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3763:41"/>
corrupted in qualitie, without the bloud, and ſo conſequently may be euacuated without bloud by inward medicine: ſo that it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for the other humors in this ſort to be euacuated, and vnnaturall ſo to euacuate bloud: which was the cauſe that <hi>Haly</hi> vpon <hi>Galens</hi> authoritie affirmed, that <hi>Galen</hi> cauſed one to be hanged, which euacuated bloud by inward receit.</p>
               <p>To the former obiections therefore wee anſwere thus: <hi>Iſaac</hi> his ſaying; <hi>Quod prodest Choleri prodest ſanguini,</hi> is to bee vnderſtood not of euacuating medicines, but of altering receits, as thus: thoſe things that are profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to alter choler, and to extinguiſh the amitie thereof, they worke the ſame effect in alteration of the bloud. Or wee may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of euacuation, and expound it thus: Thoſe things which are profitable to eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate choler, are profitable to mundefie the bloud; becauſe, by euacuation of choler, bloud is mundefied and cleanſed.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond we anſwere, that this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (Bloud is naught and offendeth as do other humors, therefore it is good to eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate the ſame by medicine, as other homors offending are euacuated) this is a fallax of the conſequent, or rather <hi>figurae dictionis:</hi> for it followeth not, that if bloud offend it muſt be euacuated by inward medicine; becauſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3763:41"/>
the ſame may better and more ſafely be done otherwiſe; namely by <hi>Phlebotomie:</hi> and this may ſerue for aunſwere to the ſecond doubt before moued in like manner.</p>
               <p>To the third may be ſaid, that <hi>Pulpa</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forcible, it greatly debilitateth the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and therefore, when bloud is ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it looſeth and euacuateth the ſame, and letteth the bloud conteined in the member, to paſſe away; but it doth not attract the bloud: and this is verie pernitious to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of man.</p>
               <p>The anſwere to the fourth, is plaine in the premiſſes. VVhere note, that although it haue bin declared in this Chapter, that bloud is not to be euacuated by ſiege, as other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are: which fluxe of bloud that way, we rather account a diſeaſe, than a remedie: as in <hi>Dyſenteria</hi> &amp; ſuch like: yet this notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we do not denie, but medicines may be verie profitably giuen, and receiued to mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie &amp; to purge the bloud.</p>

Yea, it is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as it ſeemeth to <hi>Galen, lib. de Curand. ratio per ſanguinis miſsionem cap. 6.</hi> altogether to abſteine from bleeding in vntemperat drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers &amp; gluttonous perſons: as from ſuch as cannot be cured either by purging or blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. For by their vntemperat life, they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſhort time againe, great abundance of rawe &amp; vnconcocted humors. VVith ſuch it is not beſt to deale: for to what purpoſe is it, to haue the excellent vſe of this practiſe, by theſe mens intemperancie defaced among the common people, which hath been ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a helpe to diuers?

               </p>
               <p>The ſeconde matter, putting off this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe for a time, are the excrementes of the bellie. Therefore, firſt exonerate the wombe before bleeding, if it bee not ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it ſelfe, with a Cliſter of decoction of Mallowes, putting thereto Oyle and Salte, or with a Suppoſitorie, or with eating a little <hi>Caſsia fistula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The thirde impediment, is ſome other
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3763:43"/>
voluntarie euacuation, that may be at that preſent time: as in fluxe of Termes in weo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and in fluxe of the Hemorroids: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi>Gaelen</hi> likewiſe conſenteth, <hi>lib. 9. Cap. 5. Method. Meden.</hi> in theſe words: If (ſaith he) in time of bleeding, it happen, that the Termes do flowe; or that the veine called <hi>Haemorrhois</hi> be open, if the force of the ſame fluxe ſeeme ſufficient, ſo that it alone may euacuate that which thou requireſt: thou ſhalt leaue the matter wholly to nature: if not, then thou maiſt detract ſo much bloud, till by both wayes, that be brought to paſſe, which thou wouldeſt haue done. But this is not alwayes to be followed: for in euacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to turne away the matter, as in immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate fluxe of Termes, or in the fluxe of the Hemorroides wee practiſe bleeding, as was afore ſhewed in the Chapter of Reuulſion.</p>
               <p>Againe, concerning theſe voluntarie eruptions of bloud, when wee intend to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a veine, if the eruption haue been much, then ſtay from further euacuation. But if it little or nothing haue withdrawen the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the diſeaſe, it debarreth vs not of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bleeding. Therefore, if the diſeaſe and preſent neceſsitie require it, &amp; that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of nature haue not beene damnified by that voluntarie eruption, wee may ſpeedily open a veine, as in a ſtrong pluriſie. If there
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3763:43"/>
haue been much ſweating, vomiting or great ſieges, we are not to let bloud: but if theſe ſlake, and that the naturall powers are a little in time recreated, then wee may verie ſafely bleede. For thoſe being but accidents, &amp; not remouing the cauſe of the diſeaſe, can not ſerue in ſteed of bleeding. So in a hote agew, if the wombe be laxatiue, and that there happpen <hi>Lienteria</hi> (which is a fluxe of the ſtomacke, when the meate and drinke run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from a man, as he tooke it, vtterly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out concoction or alteration, riſing of great weakenes of the ſtomacke, ſpecially in the power retentiue, which is not able to keepe the meate till nature in ful time may concoct it, through immoderate drinking of colde water: from which, ſome cannot refraine in hote feuers: This (I ſay) doth not hinder bleeding, but becauſe thereby natures ſtrength is enfeebled, the ſame conſidered, the bleeding muſt be the leſſe, if voluntarie eruption of bloud remoue the matter of the diſeaſe, or in ſome reaſon bring eaſe to the patient; according to diſcretion, commit the matter to nature alone. If not, take away ſome bloud, that through natures worke and the Phiſitions practiſe togither, the cure may be accompliſhed. Thoſe things which nature of her ſelfe can finiſh, meddle not withall; but helpe her with Art, in that which ſhee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3763:44"/>
and cannot of her ſelfe make an end: therfore I ſaid, in a Pluriſie, in a continual fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, if bloud abundantly flow fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bellie, hemorroids, or noſe: ſo that the quantie of the euacuation be iuſt, and the patient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by eaſed, let no further bloud. If bloud come but ſmally from the foreſaide, and that the ſickneſſe ſtill continue vehement: that which wanteth is to be done by opening a veine: yea, although the patient be a woman in child-bed: yea, &amp; therefore ſometime in a bloudie fluxe, a purgation is giuen, that the ſame which commeth foorth but ſoftly and ſlowly, by reſon of the vnprepared paſſages; may flowe more abundantly by a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient courſe.</p>
               <p>The fourth impediment, is the age of the partie that is to bleed, either being too old or too yong. Old folk are not to be let bloud, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe there is in them little good bloud, and much ill bloud: bleeding from them taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the good, and leaueth the bad behinde. Olde men after <hi>70</hi> yeares are not to be let bloud, except they be of a ſtrong conſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of body, &amp; that the vehemency of the diſeaſe require the ſame. But if in theſe yeres, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of the bodie be weake, &amp; that bloud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth not: bleeding is not to be in them practiſed: for as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, in men of theſe yeres, there is little good bloud; but of rawe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3763:44"/>
humors great plentie: ſo that opening of a veine, ſendeth forth the good; but the ill blod gathered together in the chiefe veines, in the Liuer, &amp; that part called <hi>Meſenterion,</hi> which is the double skin that faſteneth the bowels to the backe: or rather, the branches of the veine called <hi>Porta,</hi> which conuey the iuce of the meat concocted from the ſtomake to the Liuer, it draweth forth into the whole bodie. Conſider therfore, the ſtrength of the body, the vehemencie of the diſeaſe: for not onely the number of yeres, but the conſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo of the body is to be marked. There are of <hi>60</hi> yeres that are not to bleed, being weake old men. The age fit for bleeding is <hi>at as florens,</hi> that is: after ſome, the <hi>17</hi> yeare of age: after ſome <hi>9.</hi> after ſome <hi>10.</hi> after others <hi>14.</hi> or <hi>13.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before the <hi>13</hi> yeare, after the moſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued writers of our time, wee are not to let bloud, except thoſe youthes haue broad veines: be of ſanguine complexion, and that the diſeaſe be dangerous &amp; require this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe neceſſarily. In theſe caſes wee may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a veine, if the veines well appeare: or we may diminiſh bloud, by ſcarifying the legges or armes. <hi>Schola Salerni</hi> ſayeth: <hi>Denus ſeptenus vix Phlebotomon petit annus.</hi>
               </p>

Children then before they come to <hi>13.</hi> or <hi>14.</hi> yeares, are not to bleede, except ſome great dangerous diſeaſe of neceſsitie require it at nine or tenne yeares: the reaſon is, becauſe their fleſh and skinne is yet but tender, and eaſie to breath thorow, as <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſeth <hi>lib. 9. cap. 17. Method. Medendi,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>Pueroru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſubstantia omniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le digeritur ac diſsipatur, propterea quod eſt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium humidiſsima, eſt omnium minime frigida.</hi> The ſubſtance or fleſh of children, is moſt eaſie of all reſolued or ſeparated, becauſe it is moſt moyſt, and leſſe cold than other fleſhie ſubſtances.

And againe <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> ſayeth, <hi>lib, 11.</hi> of the ſame worke <hi>Cap. 14</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Synochus</hi> a kinde of feuer: <hi>Si in puerum incidat, qui 14. annum non hactenus attigit, mitti illi ſanguis non debet, propterea quod tantillis, cum praeſertim calidi ac humidi ſint, plurimum corporis ſubstantiae quotidie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluat ac digeratur: it a quod ex incidenda vena, moliendum nobis fuerat, id vltro nobis ex cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti corporis natura praestatur. i.</hi> If this feuer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to a childe yet not <hi>14</hi> yeares of age; he is not to be let bloud, becauſe ſuch yong ones, being of a hote and moyſt conſtitution, haue much of their bodily ſubſtance daily diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3763:45"/>
So that the ſame which we goe about to bring to paſſe by opening a veyne, is done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to our hands by the conſtitution of the Patient. Of this imp e diment, namely, the age, beſide old men and boyes, are alſo meant decrepits, and very Infants. <hi>Auicen</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth in <hi>quarta primi, cap. 20.</hi> this matter writing almoſt in this manner: Thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to beware of opening a veyne in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion too colde, in a Country too colde, in time of extreme paine in a member, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutiue bathinges, after carnall copulation, in young age vnder fourteene, and in olde age, except thou haue great confidence in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of the Muſcles, in the largenes and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the veynes, and rednes of the colour: ſuch either young or olde, boldly may be let bloud. Yet thoſe that are young of fourteene yeare olde, muſt bleede orderly by little and little at once, and at each time more than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and all this did <hi>Auicen</hi> take out of <hi>Galen.</hi> So that although in <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> wee are chiefly to conſider theſe three thinges, that is to ſay, the danger of the diſeaſe, the age and naturall ſtrength of the party: yet the age is ſometime not wayed when the ſtrength of nature ſerueth, either in old or yong. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Galen lib. de curand. ratione per ſanguinis miſſionem cap. 13.</hi> willeth to let bloud young ſanguine children, and olde ſanguine men,

without conſideration of age, if the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe be vehement and dangerous, if the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy bee ſufficiently ſtrong, and that there alſo bee vehemency of the Pulſies. In theſe caſes <hi>Neceſſitas non habet legem;</hi> Necesſity hath no Lawe. So in Spaine they let children bloud of three yeares olde and leſſe, and <hi>Auenzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar</hi> writeth, that hee let his ſonne bloud at three yeares of age, and ſo preſerued him from death, <hi>lib. ſepti. cap. tertio Collecta.</hi> Theſe limits of yeares in this point <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> did not ſet downe. <hi>Galen</hi> appointed them from fourteene, to ſeauentie.</p>
               <p>Mooued by the foreſaide reaſons; <hi>Rhaſes,</hi> in olde decrepite age, nothing at all fearing the danger of exhauſting the naturall heate, that remaineth in the body with the bloud, (whereof notwithſtanding often proceedeth the hazarde of life by vndiſcrete bleeding) by opening a veyne in decrepite perſons, did then helpe, and did great good in grieuous Plureſies and Perypleumonias. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning young folke, this wee find true by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that in the fifth or ſixth yeares of their age, by opening a veyne, Plureſies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inflammations, and other grieuous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are cured.</p>
               <p>Yea, wee ſee by the very courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that Children and ſucking Infantes, oft plentifully bleede at the noſe without any

hurt of body, or any diminiſhing of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſtrength.</p>
               <p>The age of Childhood hath naturally her ſtrength and bodely forces, why therefore may we not euacuate bloud: according to the proportion of the ſame?

There is therefore no age in my poore iudgement, but may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide ſome meaſure of Euacuation by blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding if the child bee paſt fourteene yeares of age: Yet conſideration is to be had of what conſtitution hee is, whether his bodely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance be fat or leane, thicke or thin, groſſe or ſlender, hard or ſoft, of much bloud or of litle: In the firſt we may proceed to open a veyne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the other not: and here we moſt carefully remember, that in children becauſe of their hot &amp; moiſt temperature, leſſe bloud muſt be taken, than the plenitude ſeemeth to require.</p>

                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:3763:47"/>
The fift impediment is an ill diſpoſition of the ſtomack incident to ſome men, more than other ſome, in whom chollerick humors flow to the mouth of their ſtomacks, and maketh them apt to chollericke vomits, although be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue neither accuſtomed, nor had any deſire to vomit. In theſemen, bleeding is to bee forborne, becauſe thereby the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled humors flowe to the mouth of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke as to the accuſtomed place, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtomacke cannot reſiſt ſo great a Flux of humors, being partly weake of it ſelf, and more weakened through their comming. Hereof diuers great diſcommodities growe to the body, yea this is the very cauſe, that ſome fall downe and faint in bleeding. For the chollericke humors flowing to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, bite and nip the ſame, and ſo <hi>per Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathia</hi> through a certaine kind of compaſſion that is betweene the ſtomacke, the heart, and the braine: it cauſeth <hi>Syncope,</hi> that is, ſowning. VVherefore <hi>Galen lib. 12. Method. cap. 3.</hi> Durſt neither purge, nor let thoſe bloud, which haue the mouth of their ſtomacke ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſible, tender, weake and abounding with bitter choler: and which perſons alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with the ſame when they bleede, in the very beginning, long afore full euacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bee made, oft fall downe and faint: by reaſon of the foreſaide choler, and crudity of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3763:47"/>
humors. And this is alſo the counſaile of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len lib. de curand. ratio. per ſanguin. miſſio. cap. 1.</hi> and of <hi>Auicen in quarta primi cap. 20.</hi> Ye may perceiue the mouth of the ſtomacke to bee very ſenſible, (ſaith <hi>Auicen)</hi> when yee cannot ſwallowe downe ſharpe and bitter thinges without hurt. VVeakenes of the ſtomacke is knowen, by loſſe of Apetite to meate and drinke. Abundance of bitter cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is ſhewed, by bitternes of the mouth, by ſubuerſion of the ſtomacke long time conn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing, and by oft vomiting vp of choler. Theſe ſignes and tokens diſcried in any pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, doo dehort from opening a veyne: Yea, this ill diſpoſition of the ſtomacke: bringeth not onely <hi>Sincope,</hi> but alſo ſometime preſent death. As <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſeth <hi>lib. 9. cap. 5. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> And <hi>Auicen</hi> in the former cited place.</p>
               <p>The ſixt, is weakenes of the natural forces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of which there is a threefold condition, for they are either firme, or weake, or betwene both. The forces of nature being but weake they cannot indure <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> ſo forcible an euacuation. As <hi>Galen 2. Aphoriſmo. Aphoriſm. encipienti. In quo morbo, &amp;c. &amp; 4. Simplicis medecinae</hi> witneſſeth. This is one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall conſiderations that are to bee regarded in opening a veyne, for either wee muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort from it, if natures forces ſerue not, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage to proceede it, if they will ſerue vnto
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3763:48"/>
it. For it ſtandeth with great reaſon, that blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding muſt greatly infeeble, and put them in danger, that are already weake of nature. Yea it oft falleth out, that diuers being let bloud, carrying very weake bodies; can neuer again recouer their former and priſtinate ſtrength, as <hi>Galen lib. de curand. ratio per ſang. miſſio. ca. 6. &amp; li. 11. Method. meden. cap. 14.</hi> witneſſeth. If the body bee ſtrong, and that vrgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiity ſo require, wee may boldly let bloud. If neceſſity doo not vrge, bleede not at all, or very litle. If vpon great neceſſity in this caſe much bloud muſt bee taken, the body being feeble and not able to abide it, we are to eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate now a litle and then a little. Yea, I giue heere againe aduiſe, eſpecially to regarde this conſideration. For many times when the age, diſeaſe, and time require this kind of euacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the naturall ſtrength cannot brooke it, there inſueth <hi>Sincope,</hi> that is, ſowning: In the which caſe we muſt reiterate bleeding, as hath beene ſaid, or elſe ſtay it, putting the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on the wound; which ſtay the Grecians vſed, and called <hi>Apphaſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeauenth ſtay or let is, the habite and conſtitution of the body, wherein wee are to regard the whitenes or blackenes, leannes or fatnes, thicknes or thinnes, of the bodies that are to bleede. Thinne, white, leane and ſoft bodies are not to bleede; becauſe many
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3763:48"/>
ſuperfluities are reſolued from ſuch bodies, which being to them ſufficient, they need not any other euacuation. This doth <hi>Galen</hi> affirm <hi>lib. 9. Metho. Medend.</hi> fleſhy bodies, firme, and thicke, are ſubiect nothing ſo much to diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuperfluities, &amp; therefore may better abide bleeding: as for fatte and groſſe bodies, though they be alſo leſſe ſubiect to waſting &amp; disſipation of humors than other are; yet they hardly tollerat <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> becauſe they haue but ſmall veynes, and they being emptied by bleeding, the fat of the body wringeth, and as it were preſſeth them down. So that it is gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee feared, leſt by ſuch oppresſion, the heat of nature be quite extinguiſhed. In this point of the habit of the body, we are alſo to conſider, the capablenes of the veyns, which being great &amp; ſwollen, may better be opened than the narrow and ſmall litle veyns. Again, we are alſo here to regard, the naturall diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the humors. For hot and thin humors are flowing and quickly diſperſed. Thicke and cold humors are not ſo: and becauſe groſſe &amp; thicke fat bodies, haue leſſer veynes, &amp; leſſer bloud than leane men, &amp; that in ſuch perſons, the very fat of their bodies oft preſſeth down the veyns: ſo ſuffocating and choking naturall heate: therfore wee ſee by experience, that oftentimes theſe corpulent fat men die a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:3763:49"/>
VVherevpon alſo <hi>Hyppocrates, 2. Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſ. Aphoriſ. 44.</hi> ſuppoſed that groſſe men die ſooner, and more ſodainly than leane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. This I my ſelfe obſerued, certaine yeares paſt, by the death of a Gentleman of good credite, in this ſhiere of Kent, one Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Weldon</hi> Eſquiere, and ofthe Greencloth: VVho died very ſodainely beeing a very fat Gentleman at a pariſh called great Pecham.</p>
               <p>The eighth impediment is, the colde tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the Patient, or the coldnes of the complexion. For the bodily conſtitution beeing already colde, by bleeding, of force muſt be made more cold, VVhereby frigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie ofthe body dayly increaſeth.

                  </gap> to the whole body. The foundation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward warmth (namely bloud) being dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, inwarde heate decayeth, and the body ſtill by little and little waxeth more colde. And this is teſtefied by <hi>Galen, lib. de curanda ratio per ſanguin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> miſſio. cap. 6.</hi> Yet when the ſicke is of a melancholy conſtitution, and is grieued with much Repletion, or that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy

hath much bloud mixt with it: in this caſe hee may bleede. And againe, a hot and a moiſt conſtitution of body, hauing alſo the bodily ſubſtance conſiſting of found, whole, and maſſie members: which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of inwarde heate is daily much diſſolued; tollerateth not ſo plentifull euacuation, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther complexions. VVhere by the way yee are to note that in Phiſicke, that body which aboundeth with much humors in the veynes, is moſt properly called <hi>Corpus humidum,</hi> and may beſt of all away with euacuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>The ninth is rawnes, ſlownes, and clammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the humors: In which caſe wee are to forbeare bleeding. For otherwiſe crudity of humors will bee increaſed. After <hi>Galen 12. Method.

               <p>And therefore againe, as the ſame <hi>Auicen</hi> ſaith further, in diſeaſes daily and continuall, called <hi>Morte Chronici;</hi> Purgation muſt goe before bleeding, and not bleeding firſt: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we are to vſe them both.

                  </gap>oyne in this third point: which is common to them all three: that is, the Country, the Aire, and ſeaſon of the yeare, compaſſe about euery Patient. Therefore in a cold Country and in winter, and when the Northwind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; open no veyne. If in a colde Country and in winter the wind blow South, and that ſo necesſity require, wee may proceede with this practiſe; ſo in a hot Country, and in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the winde blowing at the South: bleede not, If necesſity in ſummer require bleeding, open a veyne when the North-wind tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the immoderate heate of the ſeaſon. For ſurely theſe outward cauſes, though obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without any great perceiuing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they doo either keepe in, or diſperſe abroade and extenuate, the ſubſtance both of inward heat and alſo of the inwarde humors. And as in a temperature or complexion hot and moiſt, <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> is vſed beſt: and not to be vſed in complexions hot &amp; dry, or complexions cold and dry. So when the ſeaſon is hot and moiſt, as in the ſpring we may bleed ſafely. But not ſo, in a ſeaſon hot and dry, as is the ſummer, or very cold, as is the winter.</p>

coldnes of the Region, a Country which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold cannot tollerate ſo large an Euacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioṅ, as is this kind that wee nowe preſently handle.

The thirteenth hinderance, is the time or ſeaſon of the yeare, which is a matter alſo in letting bloud to be conſidered: as namely, whether it be too hote a ſeaſon, as in Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: or too colde a ſeaſon, as in VVinter: ſpecially when it is froſt and ſnowe. For to what purpoſe is it, when the bodie is alreadie ſufficiently cooled, through the colde ſeaſon of the yeare, to make it more colde by blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.

whether Hemorroids or Termes, are reſtrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, contrarie to former cuſtome. Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee ſtill vſe our accuſtomed exerciſes or no. But although diuers matters herein are to be regarded: yet in cuſtome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, theſe three are to be marked: The precedent order of dyet: the kinde of life, that we haue ſpent before: and former eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations. Thoſe that haue liued ſparingly, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their owne ordinarie preſcription, or by occaſion of ſicknes; are to bleede leſſe. Thoſe that haue liued more frankly, may bleede more plentifully. He that hath been alreadie let bloud, ſo that the natural powers be not thereby too much enfeebled, may, as I now ſaid, better abide to bleed, than they that neuer were let bloud. For this is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rule: Things accuſtomed, yea, if they be euill things, are the leſſe grieuous; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is confuted the opinion of the vulgar ſort: who greatly commend the firſt opening of a veine, as a matter greatly healthfull: and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend all the other bleedings, making their reconing of this in their moſt extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: that though they were neuer let bloud before: yet now they will ſend for the Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomer, as their laſt refuge.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenteenth impediment is, carnall copulation: preſently after which, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a veine is alſo forbidden, becauſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3763:55"/>
                  <hi>Venus</hi> ſo lately embraced, hath thrown down and weakened the powers of the bodie, and warmed the ſame more than was conuenient. How the powers of mans bodie are looſened &amp; enfeebled through venerious actes: <hi>Galen</hi> moſt excellently declareth, <hi>lib. 1. de Semine. cap. 25.</hi> ſaying: In the time of carnall copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the ſtones or genitors, drawe forth of the veines all ſuch ſeedie humor as is contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them; which is not much in quantities and that which is the ſame, is admixed with the bloud in the likenes of dewe: and this to do, is the office of the Teſticles. So that firſt by the genitors hauing more ſtrength than the veines; the ſeedie moyſture is violently drawen from them. And againe, the veines drawe the ſame from the members next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: Theſe partes againe exhauſt from thoſe next vnto them in like ſort: ſo that this extraction ceaſeth not, till it haue gone tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row euery part or member of mans body: by reaſon whereof, all the bodily partes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of their proper nouriſhment: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways that part which is perfectly &amp; through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euacuated, violently taketh from that which is next adiacent, and hath more plentie of ſeedie moyſture to be extracted.

The nineteenth impediment, is ſmall quantitie of humors being in the bodie: for a good conſideration is to be had, how the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors offend in the bodie in quantitie or in qualitie: VVhether there be many or fewe humors in the pacient. And therefore ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time vpon this ground, wee open a veine in weomen with child, if there be abundance of bloud, ſufficient both for the mother and the infant in the wombe, if the bodily ſtrength be firme, and that the greatnes of the diſeaſe in them ſo require it. But hereof more at large I meane to write in another place. And ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine, beſide the quantitie: the diuerſitie of nature in humors is alſo a profitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in this practiſe. For euen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the varietie of humors, the patient is oft either to be let bloud, or not lette<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bloud: which <hi>Galen</hi> ſeemeth to witneſſe, <hi>li. 4. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita tuend.</hi> ſaying: Some humors come to perfect nutriment before the bloud: ſome are as it were, halfe concocted: ſome altogether rawe and vndigeſted: Some are but little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the forme of bloud: ſome are wholly changed into bloud: ſome verie litle, ſome more, ſome verie much. VVhen hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are a verie little, as it were, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of bloud, as not yet turned into the ſame: or when they haue a verie little excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded further than the nature of bloud: wee
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3763:57"/>
may confidently open a veine. VVhen the ſame is more than a verie little, either the one way or the other, on this ſide or beyond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wee are to deale herein more conſiderately. If the humors want much of, or exceed much beyond the nature of blond; we are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to forbeare bleeding.</p>
               <p>The twentieth let: after the ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of the other humors, may be the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of the bloud: which the wiſe Phiſition in this practiſe will moſt wiſely regard. As for example: if there be little good bloud in the body, and abundance of other humors: wee are to make ſtaie from opening a veine. If any of the other three humors be but litle in quantitie, and the bloud abundant; we may boldly let bloud. Yea, by diligent obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Phlebotomer ſhall eaſily perceiue, what hurtfull humor may be withdrawen with the bloud: and therfore, if there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cholerike humors in the body of man, and yet not mixt with the bloud: or that there be many flegmatike and rawe humors, and but little bloud; by no meanes is a veine to be opened. This doth <hi>Anicen</hi> forbid <hi>in quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta primi. Cap. 20.</hi> If the bloud be good and little, and that there be in the ſame bodie many ill humors alſo: bleeding taketh away the good, and leaueth the bad behind. And a little after he addeth: that the Phiſition is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3763:58"/>
diligently to beware, leſt by vnskilful blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in theſe caſes, hee bring the patient (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath extracted the bloud, (the ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors ſtill remaining) to an exceſsiue heat of cholericke humors, or too much crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of colde and vndigeſted humors. And although (as ye haue heard before) <hi>Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy</hi> doth equally euacuate all humors. Yet becauſe now ſo little bloud is in the veines, whereof a little portion is withdrawen by bleeding: it followeth that but a little bloud, and leſſe than before, remaineth now in the veines with the other humors: and that there is great plentie of the other humors: foraſmuch as they come not out ſo redily, when a veine is opened, as the bloud doth: and therefore, by a neceſſarie conſequent, bloud being gone: which was, as it were, a bridle to other humors: choler muſt exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely boile, and flegme become more colde and vndigeſted. VVhereupon alſo I gather, that thoſe haue done ill, and verie vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, which haue reproued <hi>Auicen</hi> of error in this place, ſeeing he is rather verie highly to be commended: then vpon euery ſmall and light occaſion to be reprehended.</p>
               <p>Finally, wee are to forbeare letting of bloud after continuall vomitings, hunger, great watchings, extreme labours, and after

               <p>IN this Chapter I wil be but briefe, becauſe I was prolixe in the other before, from whence many things concerning this point, may be verie well, and with great profit ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Neither determined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> at the firſt, to haue made hereof a diſtinct Chapter: but that in certaine Latine writers I found the like done before: whom I thought good to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. Firſt, therefore this practiſe is beſt for delicate, idle, and corpulent perſons, which vſe to feed plentifully on the beſt nouriſhing meates, without taking any great paine, as <hi>Auicen</hi> witneſſeth <hi>in prim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, for ſuch as haue abundance of bloud; which is knowen by many vnfallible ſignes, and ſpecially by thickneſſe of vrine: For abundance of bloud maketh the vrine thicke, as aboundance of yellow choler ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſame thinne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for ſuch as abounde with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, hauing in their bodies, much natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Melancoly running with the bloud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe bloud is not throughly purified from it in the Liuer. And therefore in this caſe <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> muſt go before purging, and not contrane, as hath beene aforeſaide.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:3763:60"/>
And here is to be noted, that Melanco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie is two-folde. One kinde is naturall: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kinde is not naturall. Naturall Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancoly is the refuſe of bloud: And when the ſame aboundeth, it runneth about in the bodie with the bloud: and to euacuate it, a veine muſt be opened: and ſo this kinde of Melancolie paſſeth with the bloud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe bloud and the refuſe thereof, that is naturall Melancolie, commeth of one and the ſelfe ſame temperate heate. And when euacuation is thus done, a purgatiue may be vſed. But let purgation ſucceede <hi>Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomie</hi> after ſome ſpace, namely, when the concoction is finiſhed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, bleeding is much profitable to thoſe in whome is to be feared ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie heat, ſhortly to followe: or ſome extraordinarie boyling, either of bloud or of humors, or ſome other perturbation of bodie, through too much aboundance of theſe. Such perſons as feare or feele any of theſe things, are preſently to haue a veine opened. VVhere note, that this rule yet oft deceiueth diuers practiſioners: For when their pacients doe feele any heate or calefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, preſently they iudge it ſome ebullition of humors, and ſo let them bloud: whereas the ſame may come through heate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of yellow choler: in which caſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3763:61"/>
it is ſo farre off by bleeding, that the heat &amp; ebullition ſhould be allayed, that they are the rather thereby encreaſed and ſtirred vp. For bleeding (as hath beene tolde you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) prouoketh the humors to runne tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row out the whole bodie, with the greater violence. In ſuch a caſe, therefore opening of a veine ſhould not be vſed; except the ſame heat and ebullition came altogether of aboundance of humors: which is knowen through abundance of ſweat; chiefely that ſweat which is in the morning. For ſome do not ſweate, but when they haue neede of euacuation.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, it is to be practiſed on them alſo eſpecially, whoſe bodily powers are firme and ſtrong: and that are of a ſanguine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, that is hote and moyſt: and not colde and drye. <hi>Rhazes, lib. 7. ad Almonſo. Chap. 21.</hi> ſayeth: <hi>Corpora quae venas habent amplas, &amp; conſpicuas, quaeque hirſuta ſunt, &amp; colore inter rubrum fuſcunqne medio, adoleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centum nimirum, iuuenum, &amp; ſenum non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepitorum, Phlebotomiae preſidia magis tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare poſſunt: pueris vero &amp; infirmis vena ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canda non eſt, niſi maxima incumbente neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate. i.</hi> Such bodies as haue large and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt veines, that are hairie, and of colour betweene red and browne: ſpecially of ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plings,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3763:61"/>
yong men and olde men, not decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pites: may moſt ſafely awaye with the helpe of bleeding. But wee are not to open a veinein children, and weake folke, except great neceſsitie ſo require.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, this practiſe is with great heede to be vſed: or rather not at all to be vſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the paine of the cholicke, or rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderat perturbation of the bowels: either aboue or beneath: whether it be <hi>Cholica paſsio,</hi> or <hi>Illiaca:</hi> For the Humors, as ye haue heard in the Chapter before, being mooued by bleeding, the chollericke humor would flowe vnto the ſtomacke, and inflame the ſame: nor yet after ſtrong vomits. For the like euent woulde followe: nor after a laske.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch like extremities vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently heating rhe bodie, and greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing the ſame: if they ſhould concur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e with <hi>Phlebotomy:</hi> they would too much inflame the bodie, exceſsiuely moue the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and mightily weaken the forces of Nature, as appeareth in the Chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Fig. 20.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seuenthly, weomen with child, or hauing their termes, are not to be let bloud. In weo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with childe, this is the reaſon: becauſe naturall heat ſeruing for digeſtion, woulde
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3763:62"/>
thereby be diminiſhed, and ſo nutriment would be with-holden from the child, which were verie dangerous, if the mother were farre gone with child. The fruit in the womb is nouriſhed by the Termes: and not hauing whereby to be nouriſhed, it muſt of force in the wombe (hauing life, and wanting nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment) die for hunger. And againe being loſened from the naturall ſtaies in the womb, it falleth out of the naturall boundes, and ſo cauſeth aborſion. This (I ſay) ſooner happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth when the yong frute in the wombe is growen much, and the mother farre gone therewith: for then it needeth the more nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, which it can neither finde nor haue, the bloud being diminiſhed. <hi>Fulchſius</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth more hereof <hi>31. Coment. lib. 5. Aphoriſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Hippon.</hi> But here I am to adde: that albeit in auncient time it was accounted perilous to let bloud weomen with childe, as appeareth by that which hath beene now ſaid: yet out of the Chapter precedent <hi>Fig. 19.</hi> it partly appeareth, that this practiſe may be done di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreetely and ſafely, in weomen with childe, if neceſsitie ſo vrge: chiefely, if bloud be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in them: if the bodie be firme and ſtrong. I affirme that they may bleede: But becauſe it hath beene reputed dangerous; wee muſt carefully ſee that we take not from them much bloud. To take a little after the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3763:62"/>
fourth or fifth moneth of conception hurteth not. Yea, experience prooueth, that women thereby are made merry and light, whereas before they were very melancholly, feeling alwaies about them an vnaccuſtomed heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: yea, through a little bleeding they are inabled with the more facility, to beare their burden to the due and iuſt time of their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance. Againe, ſome women being with child require twiſe to bleede: that is to ſay, when they are halfe gone, and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the eighth moneth; but hereof take great heede, except the woman greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with bloud. I haue ſeene ſaith <hi>Guin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi> a woman with child, that hath beene let bloud three times, in the ſecond, the fifth and eighth moneth: becauſe ſhee was very ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine, and had experience once or twiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of aborſion the third moneth, if ſhee had not bled the ſeconde moneth. In the other moneths the fifth and eighth ſhee was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſuffocation, except ſhee had bled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. VVhen women are brought a bed, they muſt not bleede, except their ſeconde birth be ſuppreſſed, or a Feuer moleſt them: In the which caſes alſo, carefully conſider in the Patient, her naturall ſtrength. Thoſe that haue their termes naturally, according to the due courſe of nature, and the courſe of the moneth: are not to bee let bloud, except in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3763:63"/>
immoderate Fluxes, to drawe backe the matter. VVhen they breake forth natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the whole matter is to bee let alone to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, bleeding is not good for ſuch perſons as are bounde, and haue the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments retained. For as yee heard in the eighth Chapter, <hi>Fig. 2.</hi> The veynes beeing emptied, they attract matter from the next members, and they attract from the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke the moyſtnes of the excrements, whereby they become more dried and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, bring diuers waies annoyance to the body. In which caſe the wombe by Art is to be made ſolluble, as appeareth in the place now cited.</p>
               <p>Finally a veyne may and is to bee opened, without hurt or daunger, whenſoeuer wee feele our ſelues to bee heauy, lumpiſh, and ſtopped or ſtuffed in our bodies; firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the quantity and quality of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: which wee may knowe and diſcerne, by certaine tokens, whether it bee <hi>Plenitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do quo ad vaſa,</hi> or <hi>quo ad vires,</hi> as was ſhewed in the firſt Chapter, the more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy and drowſie a man feeleth him ſelfe to be; ſo much the more it appeareth to bee that fulneſſe, which is <hi>quo ad vires:</hi> But if hee feele the former ſtuffing in his body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3763:63"/>
than is it that plenitude <hi>Quo ad vaſa.</hi> And thus much to know the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Repletion.</p>
               <p>The quality of the fulneſſe is knowen, partly by the colours, partly by thoſe things which are very neerely ioyned to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the humors: But of theſe ſignes ſufficient hath been ſpoken before in the firſt Chapter.</p>
               <p>In theſe caſes of Repletion, if the ſtrength of the body ſhall bee anſwerable, wee are to open a veyne: for as much as bleeding is the chiefeſt remedy to abate fulneſſe. But if the ſtuffing and fulneſſe of the body bee greatly grieuous, and the ſtate of the body not anſwerable: it is not alwaies neceſſary to let bloud, As <hi>Galen</hi> noteth, <hi>lib. de Curand. ratio. per ſanguinis miſſio.</hi> And againe, <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profitable when any of the foreſaid ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes grieue and oppreſſe vs: But alſo (as hath beene ſaide) in caſes without any ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: As in the beginning of an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which commeth either of a blow, ache, paine, or weakeneſſe of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. For paine (as was ſaide) draweth the bloud vnto it, and of the weakeneſſe of the bodily parts, cauſe an inflammation without fulneſſe.</p>

               <head>What corruption of Humors bleeding remoueth from the veines. Chap. 10.</head>
               <p>IT hath beene ſaid, that bleeding generally, is the preſent and proper helpe, when Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors offend in the veyns either in quantity or in quality. It hath been already declared, that ſome humors it euacuateth, other ſome it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh and pulleth backe, which is called re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, whereof hath beene ſpoken in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Chapter by it ſelfe. Now order re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth in ſome briefe ſort to ſhew what cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of humors generally, bleeding eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuateth
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3763:64"/>
from the veynes. The defect of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in the veynes is either <hi>Plethora,</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymia,</hi> as was ſhewed in the firſt Chapter. The onely and peculiar remedy of <hi>Plethora,</hi> or abundance of bloud, is the opening of a veyne. And foraſmuch as fulnes of bloud is of two ſorts: One of fulnes ſimple and pure, conſiſting of a like proportion of the beſt humors: and the other vnpure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, taking part with <hi>Cacochymia:</hi> that is, abundance of humors corrupted in the veynes. Therefore it is to bee marked, that in both theſe Repletions, the opening of a veyn greatly profiteth. VVhen ſo euer therefore the muſcles are ſounde, whole, and full, the veynes large, great, and ſwelling, menacing thereby imminent danger to the members: preſently bloud muſt bee detracted. After which eu cuation theſe effects will inſue: mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of paines cauſed by ouermuch ret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the veynes: eaſe vnto the body, which ſeemeth as it were nowe disburdened of a grieuous and waighty ponderouſnes: a more nimblenes to all exerciſe and labour than was before: an increaſe and refreſhing of the naturall heate: an opening of the ſtraight paſſages and pores of the members. Finally, there will follow a happy repulſe of diuers imminent dangers and diſeaſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto by all probability in ſhort time the body
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3763:65"/>
would haue beene brought.</p>
               <p>For it is greatly tobee feared, leſt the veynes ouerreatched with fulneſſe of bloud, ſhould open and breake, and through that meanes cauſe inflammation, or leſt ſome generall obſtruction ſhould ariſe, which might keepe backe the inwarde heate, and ſo vtterly choke vp the bodily forces wherby might bee cauſed ſome vehement hot feuer, or as it oft hapneth a ſodaine death of the party.</p>
               <p>Now from theſe daungers, can no man bee ſafely and ſpeedely freed, either by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, exerciſe or abſtinence, but by bleeding, and with the bloud is this Repletion moſt ſafely abated.</p>
               <p>That fulnes which is vnpure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, is not ſo ſafely cured by bleeding, and yet the more nigh that it commeth in likenes to that Repletion which is ſimple, and pure: the more confidently, and the more plentifully we may let bloud. And the more vnpure that it is, the more carefully and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly ought a veyne to bee opened. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe perſons that haue an il conſtitution of body, and yet haue their veyns abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly filled, or that beeing of a conſtitution, are yet repleat with corrupted meates: Theſe I ſay, are to bleede no longer, but to auoid the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3763:65"/>
danger of fulnes, and the impurities remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning behinde, are to bee expelled by Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Hot chollericke Repletions, of all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure conſtitutions, are moſt ſafely abated by bleeding, becauſe bleeding in this caſe, not onely diminiſheth choler, but alſo coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the ſame mightily.</p>
               <p>Melancholly Repletions, can nothing ſo well away, with this practiſe, becauſe it doth not ſo exceede in heate, that it neede at all any refrigeration or cooling, and the flegmaticke conſtitution can in no caſe brooke it, for being a very cold complexion it quite reiecteth bleeding. For <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> by great cooling, ſo greatly increaſeth cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and rawnes in the body, that it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer or very hardly bee recouered or amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>VVeakeneſſe of bodilie ſtrength, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth this foreſaide Repletion, and therefore alſo by the ſelfe ſame reaſon, reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth any large euacuation. And in truth, is not in this reſpect to bee dealt withall, except the veynes abundantly repleate, threaten ſome great hurt, or that neceſſity ſo require it, and then it muſt not bee done all at once, but by little and little, as it hath beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:3763:66"/>
Therefore in each and euery fulnes that is vnpure, we are to begin with opening a veyn, for without it wee cannot ſafely afterwardes purge. For a vehement purgation eſpecially (if bleeding haue not gone before) troubling and moleſting the full body both with much heate, and by force of the attractiue vertue: bringeth the Patient into greater hazarde than he was before, and therfore to conclude this point, the veynes being ſwollen, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, if moderate bleeding doo no good, it can doo no harme at all.</p>
               <p>The otherfulnes <hi>quae ad vires,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not very eaſily be knowen by ſignes, althogh it cannot ouerſtretch or breake the veynes, nor ouercome the inward heate: yet becauſe it oppreſſeth the weake forces of nature, leſt there ſhould inſue putrifaction or corruption of humors, it may be diminiſhed by opening of a veyne: Leauing yet behinde ſo much as nature may eaſily rule: yea, and the ſame alſo, (becauſe it bringeth no doubt of preſent danger) may be profitably taken away, with ſpare dyet or abſtinence. Of corruption and putrifaction of bloud and humors in the veynes without plenitude, called <hi>Cacochymia:</hi> that is, fulnes <hi>quae ad vires:</hi> There riſeth a great doubt, whether the ſame may aptly bee remooued by bleeding. VVee anſwer, that to remoue by bleeding a ſimple corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3763:66"/>
of humors in the veynes is profitable and eaſie (regard beeing had) both to the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance thereof, and to the forces of nature in the Patient. For albeit when a veyne is ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, all humors iſſue forth equally, and that there remaine behind ſtill as there did before one and the ſelfe ſame proportion of humors: yet becauſe now by bleeding part is abated of that burden, wherewithall nature was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore oppreſſed, the forces and powers natural waxe not the more feeble, but they become more ſtrong and chearefull, ſo that they can beare with the greater eaſe, thoſe humors, which as yet remaine ſtill behind, and nature hir ſelf gouerneth them with farre leſſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than before. And herevpon in continuall feuers, when there is great crudity and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the veyns, bloud being often times detracted, the vrine alſo beeing red, troubled, and thicke before: It appeareth nowe more cleare, and ſheweth forth euident ſignes of concoction. And note (here by the way) that the <hi>Phlebotomer</hi> muſt be very well exerciſed in thoſe ſignes, which prognoſticate fulnes, &amp; repletion. Yea &amp; ye muſt alſo know perfectly the place of each particular humor: leſt after the manner of the vnskilfuller ſort, when the noſe a little bleedeth, and the vrine appeare ſomewhat red, by and by yee doo let bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whereas bloud often times eaſily commeth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3763:67"/>
forth, not onely by reaſon of fulnes, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon diuers other occaſions, nature her ſelfe often attempting voluntary eruptions of bloud. Hereof it commeth that ſuch perſons as haue (as it were) the ſmall litle mouths of the veines called <hi>Oſcula,</hi> eaten or gnawen: or that haue a weake and apoſtumated Liuer: and that <hi>Hydropicall</hi> perſons bleede oft at the noſe.</p>
               <p>Alſo vrine waxeth re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Vrine waxeth yeallow in that kinde of yeallow ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which is ſimple in <hi>Scirrho hepalis,</hi> That is in the hard part of the liuer: and in that kind of dropſie which is called <hi>Aſcites:</hi> Yet in theſe effects we are not to let bloud, for <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymia</hi> proceeding of corruption of the bowels, is not that way cured. Therefore the certaine knowledge when a veyne is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened neceſſarily, is onely gathered of thoſe markes and tokens which manifeſtly declare abundance of each humor: And hereby yee may gather, that bleeding alone ſpeedily hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth that corruption of humors, which lyeth in the great veynes, and only freeth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient from this kind of corruption, except the ſame take beginning from the bowels ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: and in this kind of corruption, purgation is more meete than bleeding. And thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <head>A particular reherſall of thoſe diſeaſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or future, which are cured by bleding. Chap. 11.</head>
               <p>FIrſt as yee haue heard, a veyne is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly opened in the two plenitudes, nature being ſtrong and the age conuenient. In the fulnes <hi>quaead vires,</hi> haue ſpeciall regard that the naturall forces be firme. But if in this ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, raw, cold, and vndigeſted humors bee greatly gathered together in the body, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare; taking this as a rule, that with great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of raw humors, the ſtrength of the body cannot ſtand as yee haue already partly heard, and as <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>lib. de curand. ratio. per ſangui. miſſio. cap. 9.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it helpeth diſeaſes preſent, and future, and ſerueth both in the curatiue and preſeruatiue intention. VVe read that <hi>Galen</hi> in the ſpring time did let bloud thoſe perſons that were ſubiect to theſe diſeaſes following: to wite, Spitting of bloud: A polexies: Falling ſicknes: Peripneumonia: Plureſies: Angi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naes: Stoppinges of Hemorroids or Termes: Swimmings in the head: The Gowt in the feete and in the ioynts.

               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:3763:68"/>
Thirdly, we doo not onely open a veyne in repletion, as <hi>Menodorus</hi> falſly ſuppoſeth; but alſo as hath beene ſaid without fulnes: when wee feare ſome inflammation through ſome fall or other accidentall griefe. And moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer as wee haue already ſpecified, wee open a veyne for two purpoſes, ſometime to euacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, ſometime to pull backe immoderate flux of humors to the contrary part, as <hi>Galen</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>lib. de Curand. ratio per ſang. miſſio. cap. 11 &amp; 9. Metho. Medend. cap. 11.</hi> As to ſtay bloud at the noſe we open a veyne in the arme. For this cauſe <hi>Galen lib. 13. Metho. Medend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ca. 21.</hi> in <hi>Letargus</hi> which is a drowſie and forgetfull ſicknes, riſing of impoſtumation, of cold pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified fleame, eſpecially, in the hinder part of the braine: whereby memory and reaſon almoſt periſheth, and the ſenſitiue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is greatly hindred, cauſing men commonly to forget their owne names, alſo to ſhut their mouthes after they haue gaped and by no meanes to ſtay from ſleeping. In this diſeaſe (I ſay) at the firſt beginning thereof, <hi>Galen</hi> willed to open a veyne, albeit the diſeaſe bee colde, rather as it ſeemeth to reuoke, than to euacuate the matter: or <hi>Galen</hi> ſo appointed it, becauſe fulnes is alwaies concurring with this forgetfull and drowſie diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Herevpon <hi>Galen 11. Meth. Meden. cap. 15.</hi> affirmeth it to bee very healthfull to open a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3763:68"/>
veyne not onely in continuall feuers called <hi>Continentes:</hi> but in all feuers cauſed and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of a putrifieng humor, which ſhould not ſeeme to bee true, eſpecially in intermittant f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uers which leaue off for a time, as are tertian and quartan agues. Foraſmuch as in theſe, bloud offendeth not in the veynes: but ſome other humor beſide bloud, putrifieth without the veyns, which by bleeding in reaſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be euacuated. This place of <hi>Galen</hi> cannot ſound to reaſon or experience, except we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>Galen</hi> to giue vs aduiſe to euacuate by bleeding the matter of ſuch intermittant feuers, as haue alſo with the bloud, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and abundance of other humors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring: So that this may bee his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Bleeding may bee vſed in intermittant feuers, if they fortune to haue abundance of humors ioyned with the bloud. For obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as <hi>Galen</hi> ſheweth <hi>li. 11. Meth. Meden. cap. 4.</hi> happeneth in rotten and putrified fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, ſometime through abundance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, ſometime through the clammines, groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and thickenes of them. <hi>Galen</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore counſelleth to let bloud in ſtaying and intermittant feuers: rather becauſe of the abundance, than the rottennes or putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the humor without the veynes. And that this is his meaning, appeareth by the words which <hi>Galen</hi> afterwards vſeth, ſaying:
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3763:69"/>
Foraſmuch as nature ruling the body, by bleeding is lightned and disburthened of that wherwith ſhe was before oppreſſed, therfore ſhee will with eaſe ouercome that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth and remaineth behinde, which is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>d to ſuch feuers.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in bleeding, we are not onely to conſider the diſeaſe it ſelf, which wee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to remedie, but alſo oft times the cauſe therof: ſo that whatſoeuer the ſicknes be, if <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> may remoue the cauſe, then alſo it taketh away the griefe it ſelfe in the ende. Hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſomtime, albeit the diſeaſe be cold, yet when the cauſe moueth vs to open a vein, we may ſafely bleede without hurt. <hi>Hippo.</hi> (ſaith <hi>Galen)</hi> ſheweth a cure of his done on a woman by letting her bloud in the Ankle. This woman after child-birth, was not freed ofher ſeconds: then a ſhaking came vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her. This woman I cured (ſaith <hi>Hippo.)</hi> by letting her bloud in the Ankle, for all her ſhaking. Shaking is a cold affect, &amp; bloud is hote: and they that muſt be heated, muſt not haue bloud taken from them. He for al that, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did it: &amp; he ſheweth the reaſon. I conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (ſaid he) the cauſe, &amp; the occaſion of the cauſe. He knew the cauſe of ſhaking, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of bloud kept backe, which was a burthen to nature. The occaſion of the cauſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3763:69"/>
was the griefe of the matrix. This abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce requiring euacuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the affected part ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the place moſt fit for eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cuation: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering both theſe things together, he let her bloud in the ankle, becauſe the wombe or matrix was affected. In griefes of the womb or bellie, we take the vaine of the ankle, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing by the Anotomie the communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the veines: for ſome veines commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to ſome part of the body, &amp; others to other partes. And euacuation is to be made from ſuch veines as haue fellowſhip with the member affected. For, as yee heard in the Chapter of Revulſion: if we take that veine which communicateth not with the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, wee hurt the whole bodye, &amp; do the griefe no eaſement. The profitable vſe of this fellowſhip of veines apeareth eſpecially in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion or pulling backe of humors, which is both wel &amp; ſpeedily done, when this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of veins is obſerued, as was there decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But let vs return to our former purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, by opening of a veine, is cured the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer called <hi>Synochus:</hi> both that which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of ebullition of blod without putrifaction, &amp; that which is cauſed with putrifaction of the bloud. So are alſo hereby cured continuing feuers, coming of putrifaction in the greater veines. And to theſe diſeaſes reckoned vp of <hi>Galen Fig. 2.</hi> we may adde theſe that follow:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3763:70"/>
Frenſies, <hi>Opthalmia parotis i.</hi> an apoſtumatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about or behind the eares: diſeaſes of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer &amp; ſplene: <hi>Nephritis. i.</hi> paines of the raines and backe: inflammations of the wombe or matrix: of the priuie partes: arme-holes: armes, thighes, &amp; ioynts. Finally, all inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s inward or outward, which the Greeks call <hi>Phlegmonae.</hi> Theſe inflamations are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by flowing of bloud to a member when a veine is open &amp; broken: which bloud there abundantly heaped togither, bringeth forth a tumor or ſwelling. To theſe alſo are to be added: a conſumption in the beginning: vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of bloud: bleedings at the noſe, bely, or hemorroids: at the beginning of which diſeaſes, the opening of a veine greatly profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, ſtaying the force of the fluxe, &amp; by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, if the veine be opened at the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part, calling back much of the matter fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the member affected: ſo that bleeding is a preſent helpe for thoſe diſeaſes whatſoeuer, which take the beginning from too much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of good bloud. Thoſe ſickneſſes which come of an vnpure &amp; mixt plenitude, becauſe they are ſomewhat neere linked vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe; they may alſo be cured by bleeding. And although the matter of theſe diſeaſes be vnpure: yet either it lyeth in the veines, or procedeth from the veines. A gaine, by blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are cured Carbuncles, felons, moyſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3763:70"/>
ſcabs, outward rednes in the skinne &amp; ſuch like: all theſe are cured by this practiſe.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo is cured the burning ague called <hi>Cauſus,</hi> &amp; all continuall feuers, whoſe putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is conteined in the greater venies. Yet ſometime a continuall feuer commeth of an humor heaped togither &amp; inflamed about the ſtomack, chiefely about the mouth of the ſtomack, &amp; the flat parts of the Liuer, which feuer cannot be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away by bleeding. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the cauſe therof by this practiſe be remoued. Pure intermittant feuers, whether they be <hi>Tertians, Quartans,</hi> or <hi>Quotidians,</hi> becauſe the next matter &amp; proper cauſe of them is not in rhe greater veſſels, neither flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth from the veines, are not con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eniently cured hereby. And yet ſometime in theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we bleede, either when the veines ſwell with immoderat fulnes, ſo that therby ſome danger at hand may be feared: or when any accident of hote inflamed &amp; boyling bloud perſwadeth vs therto: as are namely beating paines of the head: toſsings &amp; mouing of the body this way &amp; that way: exceſsiue heat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtragnling the pacient. Howbeit, theſe many times come alſo of boyling choler a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the inward partes called <hi>praecordia,</hi> in the which caſes, bleeding remoueth neither the feuer, nor the cauſe therof: but onely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwageth the vehemencie of thoſe accidents,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3763:71"/>
which are preſent, or ſhortly like to enſue.</p>
               <p>Further, concerning perticuler affects cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hereby, we may adioyne, beating paines of the head: <hi>Letargus</hi> ſpoken of before <hi>fig. 3</hi> and trembling of the heart. Theſe with the foreſaid, are not onely cured hereby, when they preſently affect and afflict the patient, but happening yerely vnto vs: ſo that it is verie likely we ſhalbe grieued with them in time to come. VVe may verie well preuent them by bleeding, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue once eſpied plenitude to haue beene in vs, the cauſes of theſe infirmities. For there is one &amp; the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame way of healing common, both to mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies preſent and future. And thoſe thinges which are to be done when diſeaſes are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, may likewiſe be attempted when the ſame are but a beginning, or nigh at hand. And here is to be repeated that which hath bin alreadie ſaid, &amp; cannot be too often ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: that ſome time we open a veine, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without fulneſſe, but euen in emptineſſe: namely, when ſome euident cauſe: as a bruze, ache, or heat, cauſeth flux ofhumors, &amp; brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth inflammation to the members: and this is done, not for any greatnes, or feare of any preſent griefe; but for ſome doubt of that which is a beginning, &amp; as it were, at hand.</p>
               <p>Here ariſeth a doubt, whether it be more vſuall to open a veine, the diſeaſe being now
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3763:71"/>
preſent, or future &amp; nie at hand. The anſwere is, that when the fulnes is very great &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, though the diſeaſe be not yet cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, notwithſtanding, without hurt the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent may bleed plentifullie, becauſe the bloud offendeth nature in the aboundance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And hereby the Pacient is oft made ſafe, and eſcapeth the daunger of ſickneſſes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching. But when a diſeaſe is bred, and the forces of nature impaired or leſſened, either by the preſence or long continuance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: iuſt euacuation of bloud, without hurt, can by no poſſible meanes be made. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Hippo</hi> councelleth to preuent by blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding accuſtomable impediments rather then to ſtay their approch and comming. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon alſo in that kind of feuer called <hi>Epheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> which dureth commonly but one day, &amp; is cauſed of obſtruction. In the feuer called <hi>Synocris ſimplex,</hi> bloud is aboundantly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen, before the matter do putrifie. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion of this matter, that bloud is let more ſafely before the ſicknes be preſent &amp; already come, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when in truth it is preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: &amp; with greater profit are we to ſee his comming a far off, and ſo beware of him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſtay til he come, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> labour to repel him: wherin we are to remember a prety and common verſe ſeruing fitly to this purpoſe.</p>

               <p>Reaſon imputeth thus much: that when ſicknes preſently poſſeſſeth any pacient, the ſame requireth a ſpeedie remedie, with a greater neceſſitie, than when as, it hath not yet inuaded. Wherupon this alſo followeth, that opening of a veine is more neceſſarie, when a griefe is preſent, then when the ſam e is but onely approching. The crueltie of a preſent aduerſarie vrgeth vs with a greater neceſſitie, than the daunger of an enimie that may come, but is not yet preſent. And ſo I conclude, that in a preſent diſeaſe there is a neceſſitie. In a diſeaſe onely imminent, there is but onely, in a manner, a ſecuritie. For a further inſtruction, to know what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in particular are cured by this practiſe: I referre thee to a Chapter hereafter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which declareth in particular, what veine is to be opened in ech particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſeaſe.</p>

               <p>BLoud voluntarily and of it ſelfe iſſueth foorth from the noſe, the veines called <hi>Haemorroidae,</hi> and the belly: and ſometime alſo out of the mouth by coughing and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting. From other partes of the bodie it commeth not except very ſeldome, and that againſt nature. But from what part ſoeuer it come, if it bleede ſlowly and ſparingly, and albeit the ſame bee according to nature, yet we are to account it vnprofitable: for it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remoueth the diſeaſe, neitheir diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs from that conuenient euacuation by art, which the vehemencie of the diſeaſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. That voluntarie flux of bloud which is aboundant either in plenitude, oppreſſing natnre, or in that feuer called <hi>Sinocha</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitale, and oft cureth the ſame in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment day called <hi>dies Criticus.</hi> For in aſmuch as then a generall euill equally (as it were) occupyeth all the veines, from whence ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer abatement of bloud happen, it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth theſe accidents of heuines &amp; fulnes.</p>
               <p>But in the feuer <hi>Cauſon,</hi> and in all other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual feuers, in the which other humors pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie in the greater veines: bloud iſſuing forth neuer ſo plentifully, bringeth not ſuch profit; and bleeding at the noſe, though it
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3763:73"/>
watchinges, rauinges, headach and other ſuch like accidents, yet very hardly it remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the proper cauſe, and roote (as it were) of the diſeaſe: except there fall out ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderat bleeding, euen (as it were) to the diſſolution of the natural forces: which in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deed is neuer to be wiſhed or deſired. For corrupt bloud laſt of all floweth out of the noſe, yea and not before there hath paſſed great ſtore of the good &amp; profitable bloud. And therefore in theſe feuers, albeit the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient bleed much &amp; oftentimes, yet a veine in the arm muſt be opened. Experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (I ſay) proueth, that oft out of the noſe commeth good bloud, both in colour and ſubſtance, when vnpure and filthy bloud is drawen out of the arme.</p>
               <p>A boundant flux of bloud in theſe diſeaſes, out of the <hi>Hemorroidae</hi> veines, are out of the belly: becauſe it floweth next of all from the holow veine of the loines: the ſame is to be accounted much more profitable tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the aboueſaid. Yet neither doth this many times take away the verie root of the feuer, which lieth lurking in the veines next the hart. Wherupon it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times we let bloud in the arme, notwithſtanding: yet but ſparingly in flux of termes, in wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brought a bed, &amp; freed of their ſeconds: leſt we inflame &amp; kindle in them the heat of an
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3763:73"/>
ague. A like reaſon and more apparant there is alſo ſometime to let bloud in the arme, when the hemeroids flow. For inflammation and other diſeaſes of thoſe partes which are aboue the liuer and midriffe: are litle or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all eaſed by fluxe of bloud from the hemoroids or belly: Neither thoſe that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy the lower partes by flux of bloud from the noſe. Alſo flux of bloud out of the right noſthril helpeth not affectes on the left ſide: nor contrary. And therefore voluntary erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of bloud without reaſon forbiddeth not that bleeding which is to bee done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to art, reaſon and experience. Againe <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> helpeth diſeaſes either of it ſelf, or accidentally. Of it ſelfe it euacuateth or pulleth backe. Accidentally, ſometime it cooleth, drawing forth the hotter bloud: ſometime it openeth obſtructions, yet only thoſe which proceede of fulnes, and it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to bee vſed in thoſe affectes, which it helpeth of it ſelfe: but not alwaies in thoſe which it cureth by accident. To helpe hot diſtemperature of the Liuer by bleeding, when there is in the Pacient little bloud, is not the beſt way, but rather vſe for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch things as are of their owne nature cooling, and take proper remedies for hot diſtemperature: and thus much for this matter.</p>

               <p>IN euerie affect, wherin bleeding auaileth: the ſame is out of hand to bee done, if the diſeaſe be vehement, and the ſtrength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture agreeable.

Yea vndoubtedly this practiſe would vndoo, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>roy, &amp; diſſolue the whole ſubſtance of the naturall forces, for whoſe preſeruation ſake (in truth) we take the cure in hand. Therfore to know thorowly and perfectly, how much bloud is to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in euery diſeaſe, we muſt firſt conſider how great and greeuous the ſicknes is, and how firme and ſtrong the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of nature are. Now a diſeaſe is either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cauſed, and in ſtate, or is now a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or proceeding to ſtate. Againe a diſeaſe is called great &amp; greeuons, ether in regard of it ſelfe, or of the cauſe thereof, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the humors, or in regard of the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſnes of ſome accident. But firſt, it is great
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3763:74"/>
of his owne kinde and nature. Thus an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation in any me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber is more greeuous, then a ſimple diſtemperature in the ſame member. And again the greatnes of a diſeaſe is iudged by the great vſe and excellency of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber which it poſſeſſeth: as if it be any principall member, namely the hart, braine, or Liuer, and it is contraty when the griefe is in a baſe, vnnoble or no principall member. Againe, iudgement touching the greatnes of a diſeaſe, is to be giuen according to the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call placing of the members, as they ſtand next to the principall partes. Therefore next the diſeates of the hart, braine, and liuer, are to be accompted thoſe of the lunges, ſides, ſtomacke, and ſplen: and wee are otherwiſe to iudge of thoſe that are in parts further off: as namely the bowels, raines, bladder and the outward limmes conſiſting of bones, fleſh, and ſinewes, called in Latine <hi>Artus,</hi> and in all the other members, placed in the extremities of the body. Againe in this point iudgement may be giuen by the ſenſiblenes or feeling of the member wherein the griefe is, if the diſeaſed member haue a quick ſenſe, and a liuely feeling, the greater ferre is the danger, than if the member were but of a blunt and dull ſence.</p>
               <p>The greatnes of the cauſe in any diſeaſe is iudged by the condition and nature of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3763:75"/>
humour that is gathered to the part affected, &amp; is there the continual matter of the griefe: wherein we are to conſider whether the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour be good or bad, putrified or not putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or of what ill quallity it is any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of way. And alſo whether the ſame humour be too much or too litle: &amp; if the humor which is the cauſe of the ſicknes be wicked &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we may ſoon iudge the griefe to be great. The greatnes of the antecedent cauſe is perceiued by the fulnes or emptines of the veins, bowels, &amp; of the whole body, &amp; by the purity or impurity of humours, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in the ſame. We iudge the greatnes of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, by the intention &amp; remiſſion of thoſe things which do chaunce: as the increaſing or diminiſhing of paine, thirſt, appetit, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, and ſuch like: all which bring down the forces of nature, and make the Pacient to languiſh.</p>
               <p>As for example: If any yll diſeaſe, as namely an inflammation, poſſeſſe the Liuer, braine, or parts next the hart, and that there be a venomed and putrified humour, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And againe a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3763:75"/>
diſeaſe in which theſe do not concurre, but rather their contraries, we may iudge a ſmall infirmitie, and not requiring any euacuation. Betweene theſe are their interiected ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, of a middle ſorte, which are to bee euacuated more or leſſe according to the remiſſion or intention of the diſeaſe, and the accidents thereof.</p>
               <p>Now let vs come to the eſtimation of the forces of nature, of the natural powers ſome are ſetled, and bred in particular members: and are common, and flowing to all partes of the bodie. The forces of nature bred and ſetled in a member, haue one and the ſelfe ſame eſſence (as it were) of the inward heat: and they are called one nature, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred (as a man might ſay) of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſpirits, and the firſt begotten moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture: whereunto is added (as a matter thereunto requiſite) a ſound and whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of bodilie members. The eſſence of the common forces of nature, haue (as it were) a threefold originall or beginning, or is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>threefold ſpirit diffuſed and ſpred into the whole body.</p>
               <p>The force called <hi>virtus animalis,</hi> the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall vertue, is diffuſed from the braine, by the ſinewes: The vitall force from the hart, by the arteries: The naturall ſtrength from the Liuer by the veines: The bodily powers
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3763:76"/>
that are bred in ech of theſe parts: the brain, the hart, and the Liuer, are ſuſteined by thoſe common and flowing powers of nature: ſo that the whole liuing creature, name ly man is ruled and gouerned of both theſe vertues: <hi>Inſitae &amp; communes,</hi> ſetled and common (to vſe as good engliſh wordes as wee may) to make manifeſt this great point of phiſicks ſkill. Therefore if this liuing creature and moſt excellent creature man, bee in perfect health: of neceſſitie theſe powers of nature muſt be ſound and vncorrupted, which they will bee, if their ſubſtance conſiſt in a iuſt moderation, that is to ſay, in a iuſt or right quantity, and in a good temperament. And contrary wiſe, if the quantitie or tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their ſubſtance, be inuerted, chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, turned, or altered, they muſt needes ſuffer hurt and offence, and ſo become weake and enfeebled: Whereby their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are preſently hindered, the rule of all the bodie is diſordered, and at length there will follow euen extinction of life it ſelfe. And therefore whether the natures forces are weake or ſtrong: may be knowen by their ſeuerall operations &amp; duties. Thus raw and vndigeſted excrementes, either by ſiege or by vriyne, when either the one or the other is thinne, watriſh, or like vnto wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein fleſh is waſhed, do ſhew imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

of naturall force: ſo doth holding backe of theſe excremntes, or any other fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction naturall, that is ſtaied or hindered.</p>
               <p>Wee diſcerne the vitall ſtrength to be enfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by obſcure languiſhing, and ſmal pulſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by breathing hardly and with paine, and oftner, &amp; more quickly tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was accuſtomed: by ſmalnes and faintnes of ſpeach: ſo as the ſame onely come thereby, and not thorow fault of the lunges and breſt; as ſometime it doth, in whom notwithſtanding the vitall force may be ſufficiently ſtrong. The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to theſe, declare firme ſtrength of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall vertue.</p>
               <p>Theſe thinges declare the animall po wers to be enfebled: tumblings and toſſings of the bodie, the ſenſes offended, watchinges, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, and other principal actions hindered. The contraries hereunto ſhew the contrarie, that is, firmnes &amp; ſtrength of the animal ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. By theſe functions then you ſee, how it may be coniectured what power in nature is hurt or offended.</p>
               <p>Againe theſe powers are offended, or ſeem enfebled two waies: either becauſe they are outwardly oppreſſed, or becauſe they lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh inwardly of themſelues, &amp; in the eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation it helpeth greatly to know the one from the other: for the forces oppreſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire large euacuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the other none at al.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3763:77"/>
And the diſtinction of theſe is to bee ſought out of their euident cauſes. If cauſes haue gone before, which haue already altered or waſted the ſubſtance of the forces naturall: then wee may iudge them that they are faint and languiſhed. If theſe cauſes haue not been precedent, but that the Patient is only troubled with an vnaccuſtomed ponderoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: then theſe are but wronged and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The euident and outwarde cauſes which alter the temperament of the ſetled vertues: are burning Agues, which melt the bodily moyſtures, or whatſoeuer els, that exceſſiuely heateth, cooleth, moyſteneth, or dryeth, the ſounde, maſſiue, ſtrong, and ſolide parts of the bodie. The ſubſtance of theſe parts is waſted by very long ſicknes, which bringeth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient into an <hi>Atrophia</hi> that is, a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, wherein the body conſumeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with leanneſſe, and is not nouriſhed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the ſicke continually eate his meate: Or into <hi>Tabes,</hi> which is an other kinde of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, waſting the body by long ſickenes and lacke of nouriſhment, conſuming and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifieng the Lites: drying away the Patient, for want of naturall moyſture, hauing matter and bloud mixt together.</p>
               <p>The threefold ſpirit of the flowing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is altered, ether through ſome diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, or ſome poiſoned qualitie, of the aire

The heate of the aire, not onely of that which outwardly compaſſeth vs about, but alſo that which wee draw into our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by breathing, inflameth firſt the lunges, then the hart, &amp; all the ſpirits, ſo far till often times a feuer is kindled, and cauſed thorow the ſame.

Alſo if any corruption of humor rule in the body, the ſpirits are diſperced, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the corruption or diſtemperature of the ſame humors. Therefore when abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of rawe humors, paſſeth either the whole body or the ſtomacke: and chiefly the mouth of the ſtomacke, the ſubſtance both of inward heate, and of the ſpirits waxe cold, the Patient languiſheth, yea, ſometime hee giueth ouer the Ghoſt and ſoundeth. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon alſo when hot choler burneth, as it were, the inwarde ſpirits with immoderate heate, or nippeth and pricketh the mouth of the ſtomacke: it is the cauſe of no ſmall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils in the body of man. Sometime alſo it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out, that ſome one or other humor in the body is mixed, beſprinckled or bedewed, as it were, with ſome kinde of venemous filth, as when the ſeedy moyſture is kept in and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifieth: Or menſtruall termes in weomen

Much more manifeſtly muſt it ſo fall out, when there is any great euacuation of bloud, or good humors, whether the ſame pas forth of a wound, the noſe, hemorroids, Piles, belly, or other place. In like maner abſtinence which taketh away from the body needefull nouriſhment, enfeebleth nature. Labor like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and heat diſperſeth the ſubſtance of the ſpirits by vapors &amp; ſweat: And therfore they which liue continually in labor about furna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; hot baths, becauſe daily ſome of their ſubſtance decayeth: doo not commonly ſo abound with excrements, as thoſe that leade a ſlouthfull delicate and idle life.</p>
               <p>Moreouer they that liue very incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, haue alſo for the moſt part very enfeebled bodies, able almoſt to abideno Phiſick; &amp; by a continuall decay of ſeedy moyſtures, they haue their ſpirits mightely conſumed: wherof look before in the <hi>8. cap.

Theſe are the cauſes, which being in exceiſe, do waſt &amp; conſume inward heat, the ſpirites of life &amp; ſtrength of the bodie: which being ſo apparant as they are, may be vnto vs aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red markes &amp; ſignes, wherby to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the forces of nature haue yet loſt, or do ſtill retaine their powers, vertue &amp; ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Thoſe cauſes which onely oppreſſe the ſtrength of the bodie are inward &amp; hidden, &amp; not ſo know en vnto vs, as the forſaid: and they are theſe: obſtructions, &amp; immoderate abundance of humors which ſtop the veines &amp; arteries, becauſe they are thick, groſſe, and ſlow humors: by meanes wherof they keepe in the ſpirits, &amp; do not ſuffer them to be coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as it were, by any kinde of winnowing: whereby the vſe of the ſpirits is taken away: their vertues are oppreſſed, and grieuouſly with the inward heat offended: which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter verie oft faleth out ſo in the Lungs, Liuer, celles of the braine, in the arteries: finally, in the verie habite of the bodie.</p>
               <p>Obſtruction cauſed of too much abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of humors, doth grieue, oppreſſe, &amp; ſomtime ouercome the inward heat and ſpirites of life.

As often therefore, as the powers of nature are deſcried to be weak by the excrements: the ſpirites of life by the pulſe, &amp; breathing: the animall facultie by her proper functions; and by any of the foreſaide vehement cauſes preceeding: wee may determine the ſpirites of nature to be empaired. VVhen none of theſe cauſes haue gone before, and that yet the bodily ſtrength appeareth weake: then iudge them to be onely wronged or oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: Specially, if there do concurre ſignes of pure and ſimple repletion, or of great corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wicked humors: the cauſes greeuing and oppreſsing the ſpirites of nature being remoued: preſently their ſtrength is recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and they come againe vnto themſelues, except they be beaten downe with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of their oppreſsion. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I make three ſteppes or degrees of naturall ſtrength weakely affected: either the ſame is a little throwen downe, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, or thirdly, altogether weakened: whoſe particuler toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s apeare by that which hath beene ſaid in the premiſſes.</p>
               <p>There are ſome which only marke the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as an infallible ſigne, to iudge the bodily ſtrength by, which in trueth, is a great marke:

but yet not alone ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, being both dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnconſtant: and alſo becauſe it is troubled with diuers outward things, is ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times changed. Againe, euacuation too a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant, affecteth not onely the vitall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, but alſo in like manner, the other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of nature: whoſe decay bringeth death as aſſuredly, as if the vitall power were extinguiſhed: and therefore in euacuation it is requiſite, aſwell to marke and obſerue the other faculties of nature, as the vital powers. For if the pacient be ſicke of a vehement &amp; continuall diſeaſe, as of <hi>Lienteria. i.</hi> a fluxe of the ſtomacke, or <hi>Atrophia. i.</hi> a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, or <hi>Maraſmus. i.</hi> the endes of the feuer Hectike: let him not bloud; albeit the pulſe be mightie &amp; full. And therefore I conclude this Chapter: affirming that we are in euacuation to conſider the ablenes and ſtrength, not of one only, but of all the three aboue-ſaid, running or flowing faculties of nature. Neither to conſider of theſe alone, but alſo of the ſetled faculties, in which is conteined the action of life.</p>

               <p>The quantitie of the bloud that muſt be extracted, is knowen by the ſtrength of the patient: and chiefely by his pulſe. Therefore while he bleedeth, let the Phiebotomer or Phiſition ſeele the Pulſeis with his hand: and ſuffer the bloud to paſſe, according to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the ſame: eſpecially, when any great euacuation (as euen vnto <hi>Syncope)</hi> is to be made: Leſt it fall out vnwares, that death it ſelfe doe come in the place of ſowning or fainting.</p>
               <p>And except neceſsitie doe greatlye vrge, it is beſt and ſafeſt to abſtaine from

               </p>
               <p>If at any time, the powers of nature being weake, the diſeaſe require ſome plentifull bleeding: it is good to deuide the ſame, to open a veine twiſe or thriſe, and at eache time to detract a little bloud, as ye haue part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard before: and as it ſhall be ſhewed more at large hereafter. All ſickneſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth the ſtrength of nature, and ſo doth in like manner that euacuation, which is vſed to helpe nature. Leſt therefore it might ſeeme a verie hard dealing in this caſe, more grieuouſly to afflict one alreadie afflicted, and preſently grieued: the matter is ſo to be ordered, as the ſubſtance of the diſeaſe may be remoued, the forces of nature as little damnified as may be. Yea, it is a principall poynt in a skilfull practiſioner, ſo to worke, that the euill may be remedied, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient brought in hope of a more profitable recouerie for his health, than his former Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick hath been painful vnto him. Thoſe hurts which the naturall vertues ſuſtaine, by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate euacuation are but ſmall: and theſe are againe quieted, when the euaacuation is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed: for nature now freede of thoſe hurtfull humors, wherewith ſhee was before preſſed down, recouereth her former ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3763:82"/>
Shee renueth that which was drawen from the inward heat and ſpirites, and become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the conquerour of the diſeaſe. Shee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercometh wholly at length, yea, that which remained behind: partly by inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and partly by outward diſsipation. It wiſe <hi>Hippo</hi> councelled to giue a ſmall dyet to the ſick patient, not fearing thereby more and more to weaken the ſtrength of nature, which was otherwiſe but weake: let vs ſo eſteeme of euacuation. But as in dyet, ſo in euacuation we muſt beware, leſt the vertues of nature extremely enfeebled, do quite giue ouer, and be altogether extinguiſhed: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof, we are circumſpectly to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, how farre the patient can or may endure the ſame. For (in truth) a iuſt quantitie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen without any great hurt, taketh away and cureth the diſeaſe. And this point of the iuſt quantitie is knowen, by a compariſon of the diſeaſe, and of the ſtrength of nature: for perſons firme and ſtrong may bleed as much as the ſicknes requireth: They that are not ſo ſtrong, may bleede leſſe: they that are quite caſt downe, are not to bleede at all.</p>
               <p>And here a profitable queſtion may be moued: whether naturall ſtrength may ſo greatly be enfeebled, that it cannot or may not away with any euacuation be it neuer ſo little. VVee ſee many times, that in great
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3763:82"/>
of decayd ſtrength, there fall out voluntarie euacuations, which do much good, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure health. And againe, it ſeemeth, that to ech diminution of ſtrength (be the ſame great or ſmal) the quantitie of the euacuation may be proportionated accordingly. Neither is it credible, that an vnce or half an vnce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>blod taken, can doe no great hurt to the naturall vertues, albeit they bee alreadie much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed. Theſe matters ſeeme ſomewhat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure: but that the queſtion may be expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and all ambiguities of auncient writers taken out of the way: we anſwere by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: affirming, that there are three degrees of quantitie in euacuation. The firſt degree is, when the ſame euacuation is thorow per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and abſolute, taking away either all, or the greateſt part of the matter that cauſeth or continueth the diſeaſe. The ſecond degree is a profitable euacuation, but not ſo perfect and abſolute as the other: which taketh away onely ſome part of the ſicknes, making that which remaineth more eaſie and tollerable than it was before. The third ſtep is ſo ſmall &amp; little an euacuation, that the pacient ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is not one whit eaſed or relieued. Now to come to aunſwere the former queſtion: the naturall ſtrength is ſeldome ſo greatly deie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, except the ſame be altogether ouercom &amp; paſt all hope of recouerie, but that it may
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3763:83"/>
abyde ſome little euacuation.</p>
               <p>But hereof the auncient writers haue made no mention at all, being, as it were, a matter altogether vnprofitable, ſeeing it is ſo little: not procuring reilefe to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e, they haue decreede and ſet downe, that in this caſe no euacuation ſhould be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Therefore, the naturall powers being firme and ſtrong, require an abſolute and perfect euacuation: The ſame but meane and ſomewhat enfeebled; an euacuation more vnperfect and yet profitable: altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decayed; they require none at all.</p>
               <p>If the diſeaſe be verievehement, ſo that it cannot, either at all, or well be cured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bleeding: it requireth neceſſarily abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant euacuation: The ſame but meane, and not ſowehement; it requireth a more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate bleeding: but yet the ſame greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, becauſe the cure may afterwardes be accompliſhed with the more celeritie and ſafetie. If the diſeaſe be ſmall, it requireth ſmall euacuation or none at all.</p>
               <p>Now let vs make compariſon of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the diſeaſe, and firmeneſſe of the ſtrength together. VVhen the ſtrength is verie firme, and the diſeaſe meane, and not
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3763:83"/>
verie vehement: bleeding is not altogether neceſſarie, but onely profitable, in which caſe, bloud may be ſafely taken, and as much as the diſeaſe needeth. There is no feare to diminiſh a little the bodily forces; ſo as the roote of the diſeaſe may be pulled vp. For they are againe verie ſpeedily and redily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered.</p>
               <p>VVhen the ſtrength is firme and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe daungerous, repleniſhing the veines with an immoderate fuldeſſe, as it falleth out in the bodily conſtitution of wreſtlers, and in feuers called <hi>Synochi:</hi> a plentifull eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation is to be appointed, anſwerable to the greatnes of the diſeaſe. Yea, it profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth (ſayeth <hi>Hippo</hi> to bleede euen vnto <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope,</hi> If the patient maye abide it: in which place <hi>Hippocrates</hi> meaneth not that ſowning which commeth of feare or of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlineſſe, or of ſharpneſſe of humors, pricking and prouoking the mouth of the ſtomacke: but onely that which commeth of abundant euacuation. For ſo in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame diſeaſe <hi>Hippo.</hi> appointed as a rule and iuſt order of euacuation. And this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of minde and ſtrength is called <hi>Lipothy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miae,</hi> or <hi>Lipoſychia:</hi> in which the partie ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, heareth, ſeeth, and knoweth them that are preſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:3763:84"/>
Nowe, <hi>Syncope,</hi> is (as it were) a ſuddeine decay of all naturall ſtrength, as in the falling ſicknes: in the which the patient neither ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, heareth, or doth any outwarde action. <hi>Lipothymia</hi> is more eaſie than <hi>Syncope,</hi> and accuſtomably goeth before the ſame. In the foreſaide affectes therefore, wee let bloud euen vntil <hi>Lipothymia</hi> come vpon vs: and yet raſhly or without iudgement.</p>
               <p>Now when the powers of nature begin to quaile and giue ouer through euacuation, we muſt ſtay the bloud. Neither are wee to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede ſo farre as vnto <hi>Sincope:</hi> for then the partie eſcapeth but daungerouſly: albeit the ſtrength of the body be reaſonably firme. In conſideration whereof, wee are to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe the abounding humor, as the bodily forces will permit. And whenſoeuer they are waſted, albeit ſome of the offending hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor remaine ſtill behinde: yet wee are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to deſiſt: and this ſhalt thou moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly vnderſtand, if thou diligently marke and obſerue the Pulſies, how they alter from great to little: from equall to vnequall: from ſtrong to weake: from apparant to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure: and by marking how the force of the fluxe of bloud beginneth to relent, and the patient to waxe weake.</p>
               <p>That practiſioner which ſetteth by his credite, and will auoide ill ſpeaches, muſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3763:84"/>
neuer through bleeding, bring his Patient to <hi>Syncope:</hi> becauſe the ſame being, as it were, an image of death, terrifieth the ſtanders by, and putteth the Patient in a great hazarde of his lyfe. Yea, and it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to let the patient ſtill remaine in griefe, than to take away with the diſeaſe, life it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And hetherto we haue ſhewed, what is to bee done, touching the quantitie that muſt be withdrawen, when the powers of nature are firme and conſtant.</p>
               <p>If the diſeaſe be but meane, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily powers but indifferent, the euacuation muſt be moderated, which may remoue the whole cauſe of the ſickneſſe with little or ſmall hurt to the ſtrength of nature.</p>
               <p>VVhich albeit, it be but a ſmall and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate bleeding: yet the ſame is verie profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as ye haue heard before. If a great ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe concurre with ſtrength alreadie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, and that the ſame alſo require ſome large euacuation: yet becauſe the powers of nature cannot tollerate it, the ſame muſt not be done wholy at one time: but by ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as yee haue beene tolde: leſt wee take away both the diſeaſe and the partie diſeaſed: Natures forces being quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, albeit the diſeaſe ſo require: yet the bodie can permit little or no euacuation:
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3763:85"/>
for it is vnprofitable and ſuperfluous, not bringing any commodity, but diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and perturbation to the ſicke. Therfore in this caſe this muſt be the practiſe: mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and often to giue the patient meates of good iuice and nouriſhment, to confirm, ſtrengthen, and recouer nature: and ſuch as haue ſome vertue in them <hi>a proprietate</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the preſent infirmitie, &amp; may redreſſe the inward corruption of humors.

The conſideration of paſſed matters many times perſwade a plentifull bleeding, which the obſeruation of things preſent by and by taketh away: As for example, if the Patient laying aſide his accuſtomed exerciſe, giue himſelfe to pleaſure and idlenes, ſtuffing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe withmeats, and hauing ſome notable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacuation ſtaied in him: but his body is wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fat, white of colour, looſe, open, ſoft, full of thiniuce, and that it be Summer, a hot &amp; dry country, a hot &amp; dry conſtitution of weather without ſtormes: In this caſe, let not bloud at all, for ſufficient is already euacuated from ſuch a body of it ſelfe, and that not obſcurely, but apparantly. In this foreſaid conſtitution, thou maiſt detract a little bloud, if it bee winter, in a cold country, and the wind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at North: and in this mixture of things, thou muſt marke not onely the multitude of the obſeruations, but the force of them: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one many times exceedeth all the reſt in power and ſway, and he that can neither by art, experience, nor ſound iudgement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the quantity of euacuation, according to the aduiſe of <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> let him rather eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate leſſe, than more than needeth.</p>
               <p>In this place albeit ſomewhat hath beene ſpoken before to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>cap. 9. Fig. 7.</hi> It may be profitably demaunded, whether being with child, be to be accounted among
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3763:88"/>
theſe obſeruations heere handled, ſhewe of truth, and ſome probability may be alleaged, that when women with childe are grieuouſly ſicke, we are not to let them bloud, becauſe of the young that is in the wombe. This is alſo defended by <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> ſaying, <hi>Mulier in vtero geſtans abortit, inciſa vena: idque magis, ſi faetus auctior fuerit,</hi> that is, A woman with child is deliuered before her time if ſhee bee let bloud, ſpecially if the young be much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and growen in the wombe. But this of <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> is not alwaies true, as neither that which hee ſetteth downe a little before, <hi>Mulierem in vtero gerentem acuto morbo corripi: Lethale eſt.</hi> That is, it is deadly for a woman with child to be taken with a ſharpe diſeaſe. For ſeeing a purgation made of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and venemous ſimples, ſtandeth with greater danger of the childe than opening of a veyne, and that <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> graunteth that women with child wexed with a diſeaſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of corruption of ill humors, may bee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the moneths betweene the third and the eighth moneth; truely with much more ſafety may we let thoſe bloud, being grieued with any ſicknes cauſed of Repletion. And if in the middle time of the going with childe, the ſame may bee done: Much rather in the beginning when the bloud more aboundeth, and the yong needeth leſſe nouriſhment.</p>

Againe, if women being with child, nature of her ſelfe oftentimes attempteth euacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which is ſuperſluous (with great profit) out of the noſe, by the hemorroids &amp; belly, and that ſometime the Termes flowe healthfully at times appointed: why vpon great neceſſity may we not imitate nature in our Art? Yea, many women bring vntimely fruit except about the fourth moneth a veyne be opened, the young fruit beeing ouercome with plenitude of the Patient, neither onely in fulnes, but without the ſame a veyn is ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the arme of a woman with child, when need conſtraineth, as in a Plureſie, or other vehement inflammation. It is dangerous in deede to open any of the lower veynes in women with child, becauſe the fluxe turned downewarde, the termes would flowe, and ſo the fruit in the wombe bee deiected and caſt downe. A veyne is opened very ſeldome in the eighth or nine moneth without cauſing of vntimely birth, foraſmuch as then a woman of euery light cauſe receiueth hurt, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered before her time, through the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſlipperines of the wombe.

                  </hi> only conſidered the greatnes of the diſeaſe, and ablenes of the ſtrength. Olde Phiſitions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (ſaith hee) were of opinion that the firſt and latter age could not brooke bleeding, and that a woman with child cured

by <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> ſhould bring foorth vntimely fruit: yet experience prooued afterward that none of theſe were perpetuall, but that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obſeruations wer to be conſidered, which the Phiſition is to remember: For the matter is not great what the age bee, or what a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beareth in hir wombe, but what her ſtrength is: a fierce childe: a ſtrong olde man: a luſty ſanguine woman with child, may ſafely bleede. And thus you ſee howe a great belly in a woman may be an obſeruation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the quantity of bloud that muſt bee withdrawen.</p>
               <p>Another obſeruation to finde out the iuſt quantite, is to marke the alteration of colour in the bloud.

               <p>Let this therefore bee the concluſion, that wee muſt bleede in the beginning of ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.

are at the beginning to bee cured by bleeding: for by this meanes, the diſeaſe likely to grow is kept backe, and ſo much as is already bred, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will eaſily ſubdue: Thus hot Agues before they are yet inflamed with heate of boyling bloud, or by vehement putrifaction, are &amp; may bee cured. Alſo inward inflammations at the firſt, as long as the flowing humor cleaueth not to the member, but followeth the bloud may be cured. The ſaid humor iſſuing forth with the bloud, when a veyne is once opened, ſtrength at the beginning is firme and conſtant in the Patient, almoſt like vnto vs that are well in health: If therefore at any time bleeding bee needefull, the ſame may beſt be done at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: he that in fulnes of bloud, or fluxe of matter, will ſtay from bleeding, and vſe other helps, in a peruerſe order of healing, he doubleth the griefe, and troubleth the forces of nature more than is conuenient: Yea, let the veyne ſo timely bee opened, as the ſtomacke and firſt veynes be not firſt ſtuffed, with either corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or cruditie of humors or meats vndigeſted.</p>
               <p>Thus you haue heard the former words of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicen</hi> to be erronious, howſoeuer certain labor to ſalue them vp: yea, &amp; <hi>Auicen</hi> ſeemeth to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his owne ſaying, not only of particuler diſeaſes in the members: but alſo of all other diſeaſes. For afterwards ſpeaking of all Feuers, and eſpecially of <hi>Febris fanguinea,</hi> Feuers cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:3763:92"/>
of bloud, hee counſelleth in them not to let bloud abundantly: except there haue gone before concoction, and concerning this reaſon, that humors are leſſened by bleeding, it cannot be ſo, for yee haue already heard, that both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bleeding and after, there is retained in the body one and the ſelfe ſame proportion of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. If any difference or mutation happen, ſeeing the thin humor iſſueth foorth with the greateſt ſpeed, and the thick humor but ſlow: it is more likely, and probable, that opening of a veyne ſhould rather make the bloud and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors thicke than thin. A gaine, whereas he ſaith in his reaſon that the humors thereby are agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, moued, and driuen through the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: how ſhould there bee this agitation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, ſeeing rather this practiſe abateth the multitude of them which was before the cauſe of perturbation &amp; ſickenes. In reaſon all things now ſhould become farre more quiet than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. VVhereas he ſaith the ill bloud is mixt in the veynes with the good, what inconuenience commeth thereof if a veyne bee opened? then no doubt the bad muſt paſſe foorth with the good.

if they bee great and dangerous through much abundance of bloud, who will not preſently o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a veyne? who will not while ſtrength ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, take away that fulnes which bringeth a diſeaſe and danger of death?

But what concoction doth hee looke for of good bloud, and already well concocted, and offending onely in quantity? In theſe ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine feuers therefore, euen as in very ſharpe ſickeneſſes, either to put off, or to ſtay bleeding it is very ill, as <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> ſaith, if the diſeaſe be not ſo ſharpe or vehement, yet let bloud at the beginning, according to the proportion of the fulnes. If wee ſhould in theſe ſtay with <hi>Auicen,</hi> till concoction (the beginning and ſtate of the diſeaſe) be paſt: wee ſhould ſuffer the diſeaſe to grow &amp; increaſe, and cauſe for want of skill the Patient to bee cruelly hand'ed and intreated without helpe of Phiſicke, which wee may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter, if the diſeaſe be deadly, it will neuer be brought to concoction: If it be doubtfull, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerable called <hi>Morbus ſalutaris</hi> (as ye haue heard) after the ſtate in the declination, &amp; when the Patient is paſt daunger, what profit doth <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> then bring? as ye haue heard before.</p>

                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:3763:93"/>
Nature by concoction, ſeparateth the ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the good: theſe to conſeruation: thoſe to expulſion. This ſhe doth either by her ſelf, or by the help of Phiſick. But opening of a veine, indifferently without choice, euacuateth al hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. VVherefore then in bleeding, ſhall wee tarrie for this concoctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; diuiſion of humors? as for example: In apoſtumations, if the corup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bloud be made matter or filth, it is not then taken away by bleeding, but by ſome other meanes. So in feuers, whoſe matter is conteined in the veines: when the humor is concoct &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, we vſe not to withdraw the ſame by blee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding; but by ſome other practiſe in Phiſick: in which caſe, by that time that concoction is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, wee ſhall haue nature to helpe vs, who ofher ſelfe, indeuoureth to expell humors concocted &amp; diuided, the bad from the good.

               <p>Again, ſay ſome (in <hi>Auicens)</hi> defence, it may be that in the beginning of a ſicknes: opening of a veine maketh the ſuperfluities of the body thinne: ſo that they may flowe &amp; runne tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough out the whole body, and ſo be mingled with the good bloud, wherby it fortuneth that the ſame is not extracted, which neceſsitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth to be expelled. VVhereby alſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth further, that the patient muſt be let bloud againe, ſometime euen the ſame day, and ſometime the day after, which too much enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the powers of the bodie. And thus it is contended, partly by reaſon, partly by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the behalfe of <hi>Auicen.</hi> And ſurely, if the words of <hi>Auicen</hi> might be reſtringed, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſeldome, and onely in the caſe limitted, a veine is not to be opened at the beginning of ſicknes: it may wel ſtand to ſenſe &amp; reaſon: but <hi>Fernelius</hi> &amp; others gather, that <hi>Auicens</hi> words were ſpoken more generally, than that he can by this ſpeciall caſe only, be defended. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the matter is controuerted, as ye ſee, I haue ſet downe the reaſons brought both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Auicen,</hi> and for him. Leauing the depth

               <p>And that this aſſertion may the rather ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be true: I will ſet downe certeine ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es whereby it may truely be manifeſted &amp; appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo by ſcience and experience. Firſt, when wicked humors greatly ſwel, being (as it were) excited &amp; ſtirred vp through repletion of their owne accord: they perſwade to euacuation at the beginning of the diſeaſe, when the humors are not yet concoct. For otherwiſe, the vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant humor, mouing from place to place, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> member to member without order, might make ſtay at ſome principall member, to the great hurt of the patient. It happeneth in deede but ſeldome, that the humors are moueable, &amp; flowing from one part to another: for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly they remaine firme &amp; ſtable in one place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a veine is to be opened in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a diſeaſe: when quantitie of matter aboundeth in the veines, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, <hi>Com. 29. li. 2.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:3763:95"/>
as in verie dolorous apoſtumations: albeit there be not in the bodie much matter antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: yet the humor that is, is to be repelled, leſt the apoſtumation open and breake ſooner than is conuenient. To auoid therefore theſe gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In ſuch affects (ſaith he) a veine muſt be opened at the beginning; ſo that none of thoſe things hinder, which we haue ſpoken of. i. either the abundance of raw e humors: childiſh yeares: the time of the yeare: the temperature of the countrey, too hote or too cold. For not only in ſharp diſeaſes &amp; inflamations, but alſo in wounds &amp; bruſes of particular parts; ſpecialy being principall: bloud is to be taken from the contrarie part, to repell the inflamation: albeit the bloud be but little in quantitie.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of ſharpe diſeaſes called <hi>morbiacuti,</hi> or <hi>peracuti:</hi> opening of a veine is paſsing good. For the better vnderſtanding whereof, you muſt remember, that a ſharp diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is two-fold: either exquiſite &amp; throughly vehement, paſsing not the fourth daye, which is called of Phiſitions <hi>Malus peracutus. i.</hi> tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly ſharp: and of ſome <hi>perperacutus,</hi> imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating barbarous authors in Phiſick.

Theſe diſeaſes being but ſhort, &amp; at their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame fits in few daies, without any truce, preſently at the beginning, theſe are to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

courſe an appointed and ſet time of intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and remiſſion. For euacuation is not to be made when the diſeaſe is now fierce, but when the ſame is aſſwaged.

At which times wee may by art prouoke theſe, but in no caſe vſe purging or bleeding. In the time of the fit like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wee muſt refraine from theſe, as thinges which nature then can not brooke. If ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of bleeding, or of ſiege come, they are but accidental, and are cauſed only of the heat and force of the diſeaſe. No euacuation can be done ſafely in ſuch fits, ſeeing they do too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly hurt the powers of nature. Alſo when the humours do ſo boile with heat, that they are perturbed &amp; mingled together, there can not be made by practiſe of art any iuſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of the ſaid humours. And if it chaunce that the hurtful matter of the diſeaſe, be infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without the greater veines, &amp; that in a fit, a veine be opened: it is to be feared, leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the ſame corrupted matter paſſe into the empty veines, &amp; ſo of an intermitting feuer, wil come a continuall. Wheras a veine opened in the moſt quiet time of a diſeaſe, troubleth not nature, but without any feare of an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, taketh the plenitude out of the greater

veines. The greateſt time of quietnes, is the time in the middle, betweene the remiſſion &amp; intermiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the diſeaſe. If the time between the fits bee much, it is an eaſy matter to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſaid middle time. If the time bee but little, then is it far more hard to diſcerne the ſame. Becauſe many times no leaſure can bee graunted either before or after bleeding, by reaſon of the ſwift courſes of fits, to nouriſh the party. Thus you ſee <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> is not to be practiſed in the day of the fit of any ſicknes, which in Latine is called <hi>Criſis,</hi> or <hi>dies Criticus,</hi> in the which day, neither bleeding, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euacuation is to be atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted, leſt the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be drawen from that place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto nature hath driuen it, to be rid or diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched thereof: and therfore like wiſe neither in the fit it ſelfe ought the ſame to bee done. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently therefore did <hi>Galen</hi> giue in charge, <hi>Comment. 29. lib. 2.

For bloud beeing the foundation of inward heat, wherwith, the ſame is vpholden: (natural heat beeing ingendred of bloud, as of a materiall cauſe,) If bloud ſhould bee detracted at the beginning of a diſeaſe, the natural heat would bee diminiſhed, which ſhould concoct the materiall cauſe of the ſicknes. Whereby fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it commeth to paſſe, that the diſeaſe is longer time protracted, and the forces of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enfeebled, through which two, namely the continuance of the diſeaſe, and imbecilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of nature: great feare of death commeth in the end: and this is the caſe, wherein <hi>Auicens</hi> former opinion may ſtand true.</p>
               <p>There is therfore no preſcribed day for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, appointed to let bloud in.

               <p>Now in diſeaſes which are cured by bleeding when they are preſent, or propelled being but future: if they grant leiſure ſo that a choice of an houre to bleede in May bee made: in this caſe (I ſay) the fore noone houre is better then the after noone. For from the ryſing of the Sunne the bloud is quickened, reuiued, and beareth rule in the body: yea in that time of the day it becommeth thin, cleere, &amp; apt to flow.

For the heauenly cauſes are very farre off, neither did <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> make reckoning of them <hi>4. Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſ. Aphoriſ. 10.</hi> The firſt day wee muſt helpe (ſaith he) in ſharpe diſeaſes. And <hi>Galen de Cura. ratio per ſanguin. miſſio. cap. 12.</hi> ſaith: that thoſe perſons are preſently to be euacuated, in whom appeareth abundance of hot bloud, before the ſame begot to ſome principall part (as ye heard before) ſo that theſe things are not to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in a veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t plureſie: In <hi>Angina</hi> the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: Inimmoderat flux of bloud: In great pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the veſſels: neither in diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing agues or feuers that come by fits. In which the time of reſt, remiſſion, &amp; ſtay, is farre better than the morning time: In which wee let bloud at what houre ſo euer it be, of the night or the day: if the fit be off, and other things anſwerable. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay in theſe, we are not ſtrictly to obſerue
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3763:100"/>
theſe rules Aſtrologicall: obſerue them, as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſome force, in healthfull Patients, which bleede onely for preſeruation, and in light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſmall infirmities: if then it happen that thou do bleede.</p>
               <p>To come to theſe Aſtrologicall obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we are not to let bloud in the new or full of the moone: nor elſe except the moone bee in theſe ſignes ♈. ♋. and the firſt halfe of ♎. the laſt halfe of Scorpio, or in ♐. ♒. ♓. Alſo not in the day of the change, the day next before, or day next after: Nor when the ſigne is in the place where the inciſion ſhould be made.</p>
               <p>Another obſeruation is this, to open a veyne in flegmaticke perſons: when the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> is in ♈. ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the heade. In a melancholly man, the moone beeing in the firſt halfe, or firſt fifteene degrees of ♎. except in the hips: or when the moone is in ♒. ſauing in the legs. In a chollerick body when the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> is in ♋. ſauing in the breaſt. The laſt halfe of Scorpio: except in the priuy members, or in ♓. ſauing in the feete. Sanguine men may bleed in any of the ſignes, ſo the ſign be not in that member.</p>
               <p>Againe, after the Mathematicke, this is the conſtellation or election of time. In fiery ſignes it is good for flegmaticke perſons to bleede, as in ♈. ♐. Leo is excepted being the houſe of the Sunne, in the which there muſt be no bleeding. In Airie Signes good for Melancholly men:
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:3763:101"/>
as ♎. ♒. ♊. is excepted, and the laſt ſeauenteene degrees of <hi>Libra,</hi> becauſe ♊. reſpecteth the hands and the armes, in which commonly wee let bloud.</p>
               <p>In watry ſignes, good for chollericke men, as in ♋. ♏. ♓. In earthly ſignes it is ill to bleed, as in ♉. ♍. ♑.</p>
               <p>The generall rules of <hi>Ptolome</hi> for <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> in 30. of <hi>Centiloquium</hi> is this: <hi>Tangere ferro membrum cum Luna in ſigno illius membrieſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculoſum.</hi> It is daungerous to open a member with a chirurginal inſtrument, when the moone is in the ſigne belonging to that member. Good aſpectes in bleeding are theſe ♂. <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. and ♃. alſo <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. &amp; ♀. ſo as ♀. be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>buſt ■. <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. &amp; ♃. ⚹. <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. &amp; ♃. ⚹. <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. &amp; ♀. <g ref="char:trine">△</g>. <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. &amp; ♃. <g ref="char:trine">△</g>. <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. &amp; ♀. <g ref="char:trine">△</g>. &amp; ⚹. ☉. &amp; ♃. or <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. alſo <g ref="char:trine">△</g>. <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. &amp; ♂. or ⚹. <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. &amp; ♂.</p>
               <p>Againe this is an other obſeruation, from the new of the moone to the firſt quarter, for <hi>pueri,</hi> i. thoſe that are in their childhoode from the firſt quarter to the full: for <hi>Iuuenes:</hi> that is, young men from the full to the laſt quarter: for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iri:</hi> that is, thoſe that are of mans ſtate, and begin to grow in yeares, and from that time to the new againe: for old growen folke: Looke more hereof in a Table hereafter following. 28. Chapter.</p>
               <p>Another obſeruation, how particuler mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are to be taken, according to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler times and ſeaſons of the yeare, is this: In
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3763:101"/>
the ſpring and ſummer time, the veynes of the right ſide of the body are to be opened: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the right hand, right arme, and right, foot. But in harueſt and in winter, the veynes of the left hande, arme, or foote. In the ſpring time, bloud increaſeth: In the Summer yeallow cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler: therefore in the ſpring time, and in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, thoſe veynes are to be opened which moſt abound with bloud and yeallow choler: that is, ſpecially the right raines: for in the right part of the body is ſcituated the member cauſing bloud: that is, the Lyuer: and <hi>Choledochos</hi> the Cofer of yeallowecholer: that is, the gall.

               <head>Preparation before bleeding. Chap. 18.</head>
               <p>AS occaſion of the time is to bee taken, ſo there muſt be vſed before, ſome prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body. The neglecting whereof, would bring great hurt to the party; and ſurely, the chiefeſt preparation is this. To purge and cleanſe the members, that are in the firſt Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body: touching this preparation ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are to be regarded, whereof mention is made in the eighth Chapter, from whence I purpoſe to take foure principall conſiderations in this behalfe, being vrged thereto, for perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity ſake: leauing the reſt to thine owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to be ſcanned.</p>
               <p>There are therefore (as there wee did ſet downe) foure things eſpecially which ſtay and put backe bleeding: That is to ſay, firſt crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſtomacke and firſt veynes. Secondly, a filthy gathering together of hurtfull humors. Thirdly, the belly bound with dry and baked excrements. Fourthly, the mouth of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke weake, and very ſenſible. Theſe doo not altogether put off bleeding, but ſtay the ſame for a while till by Art they may be withdrawen or remedied. If a veyne be opened, while crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:3763:102"/>
ruleth in the ſtomacke, this euill will follow: that many rawe, vnconcocted &amp; vndigeſted hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors wilbe congeſted, &amp; gathered together in the place of bloud. In hardnes of the wombe this miſchiefe enſueth: that the Liuer &amp; exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted veines, ſuck out of the excrements, ſilthie iuices, &amp; vncleane ſubſtance: in regard whereof it is moſt conuenient, to ſtay ſo long as the rawe matter may be concocted, &amp; till the excreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts deſcend. And if they cannot vtter of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as ye heard, cap. 8. They are to be prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with ſuppoſitors or clyſters, and the womb is to be made laxatiue with prunes or <hi>Caſsia.</hi> Cruditie &amp; indigeſtion is knowen by the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie &amp; quantitie of meates receiued. Alſo by the time in which they were eaten, and alſo by ponderouſnes, &amp; raw belchings of the ſtomack. Againe, corrupt humors abounding in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, or partes neare vnto it: whether the ſame be bred there, or that they proceede from the head, Liuer, or ſplene; they perſwade the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of bleeding, til they may be purged; els this corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of humors drawen into the veins would be more daungerous to the bodie than cruditie it ſelf, and infect the veines, farre with much more vncleannes: whereof do come ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions or a conſumption, proceeding of the ill diſpoſition of the body: or the diſeaſes which we would cure, grow greater, &amp; their accidents <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:3763:103"/>
are ſtirred, they become more fierce and hurtfull, nipping the ſtomack, &amp; the parts cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>praecordia.</hi> i. the fleſhie skin called the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe, which ſeparateth the heart &amp; lungs from the ſtomack, Liuer, &amp; other bowels: whereby is cauſed appetite to vomite, convulſions, <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothimia, Syncope,</hi> and other fearſull accidents. The ſignes whereby to know, whether the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily partes are poſſeſſed with corruption of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are theſe: loathing of meat, aptnes to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, vomiting vp the noyſom &amp; offenſiue hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor: oft going to the ſtoole: heauines &amp; paine in the ſtomack, fulnes &amp; ſwelling of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack &amp; precordial parts. If theſe apeare in the patient, without cruditie of meats: then are we to expell the offenſiue humors out of the firſt region of the body, which hath bin the cauſe of the foreſaid euils. If the humor of himſelf giue vpwards, aſſay the expulſion by vomit: drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a draught either of warm water, or of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drelaeu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> warmed, that is water mixt with oyle: wherof take the quantitic of halfe a pound. If the humor gine downward, expell it by ſiege. <hi>Caſsia</hi> is not ſtrong enough to purge the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor from the ſtomack, as not being ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to expel by ſiege ſuch clammie &amp; cleauing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. For <hi>Caſsia</hi> hath but a meane vertue, and that onely to aſſwage and mollifie. <hi>Rubarb,</hi> or <hi>Senna,</hi> or ſome other gentle medicine, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the qualitie of the humor: and not ſo
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:3763:103"/>
vehement, as to moleſt the ſtate of the whole bodie. And theſe we may vſe, not once or twiſe but oftener if neede require. After all this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, then we are to let bloud.</p>
               <p>VVhen the corruption of humors is ſpread throughout all the bodie &amp; euery particular part, ſo that the whole body is vnpure: then we muſt obſerue this order: that is, we muſt purge euerie part orderly: as firſt, the greater veines: and this called <hi>Meſentericae venae</hi> which are branches of the great carrying veine called <hi>Porta,</hi> by which both the guttes are nouriſhed, and the iuice of meat concocted, is conueyed from the ſtomacke to the Liuer, to be made bloud. Yea, theſe veines are the ſecond time to be purged, before wee euacuate the whole habite of the bodie, and not contrarie: that is, from the firſt veines to the greater: and from them to bring the humor into the ſtate of the bodie: which were not to purge the noyſome humor, but to infect and hurt the whole bodie therewith. But this is the courſe: to drawe the humor from the habite of the bodie into the greater veines, from them into the firſt veins, and then to bring it into the bely. Yea, this great corruption of humors not onely ſtayeth bleeding for a time, but often times altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therefore wee let not bloud in the dropſie, <hi>in Cacheria,</hi> in hard apoſtumations of the Liuer and ſplene.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:3763:104"/>
The third matter of the preparation before bleeding was aboue ſaid, to be either the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie or imbecillitie of the ſtomack. For thoſe perſons haue notable quick feeling, whoſe veins ſent from the brain, are ſoft, tender, open &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to occur and meete with any matter, ſo that theſe perſons without hurt cannot eate anye ſharpe, ſower or ſalt things, as vinegar, pepper, muſtard. Imbecilitie of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tomake procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth either of diſtemperature, or of a verie thinne placing and ſtanding of the ſmall veines in the ſame place. And this is knowen by loſſe ofappetite, when meat cannot abide in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, but that there will be always paine ofthe ſtomack, &amp; a promptnes ſtill to vomit. Thoſe perſons that are thus affected, are troubled greatly euen with the haſard of life, of euerie ſmall occaſion: as faſting, anger, ſorrow, feare &amp; alſo by bleeding. Phlebotomy in theſe (I ſay) waſteth greatly the vitall ſpirits, &amp; greatly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the other humors of the bodie beſide the bloud, whereupon there befall to them when they haue bled, conuulſions, the falling euill, ſownings &amp; other feareful accidents, which are cauſed hereby. In ſuch therfore, we muſt haue a foreſight, &amp; corroborat the mouth of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke with things repelling the ſharpnes &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of humors: as with iuice of a Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate, a Quince, <hi>Malum medicum,</hi> with iuice of Citrons, Lymons, &amp; iuice of Barbaries, ſower
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3763:104"/>
grages, viniger, or ſyrops made of theſe. If there be doubt of a cold diſtemperature, vſe hote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatike things, chiefely ſyrop of Mynts, <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydonion,</hi> ſower or ſharpe wine, or ypocras. Take a little of theſe wines, or a morſel of good bread dipt in them, and when the patient hath a little reſted vpon it: open a veine, and this is the preparation, if the diſeaſe permit it. A ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement diſeaſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If we thinke the humors in the bodie to be thicke, and that they will not flow (for which cauſe alſo we vſe to walke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bleeding) wee may enter into a bath, to make the humors ſubtile: not the ſame daye, in which we bleede, but a day or two before: Not in the ſelfe ſame daye, becauſe it maketh the skin ſoft &amp; thinne, and ſo in the ſtroke, the skinne ſlippeth &amp; ſtarteth from the Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which is verie dangerous. For this cauſe alſo wee giue a little <hi>ſyrupus acetoſus</hi> certaine dayes before bleeding, to ſubtiliate the matter. And again, that the humors may paſſe with the more facilitie &amp; become ſubtile: to prepare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this purpoſe, we vſe frication of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3763:105"/>
to rub the arme or other parts, &amp; the members next vnto the place that is to receiue inciſion. Alſo we giue before bleeding to ſuch perſons as haue weak &amp; ſenſible ſtomacks nipped with ſharpnes of choler, flowing to the mouth of the ſame, ſome portion of meat: yet not all meates with indifferencie, but meates of good digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as a morſell of bread dipt in <hi>Syrupus aceto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> which comforteth the ſtomacke through the ponticitie, to vſe the old barbarous word the ſharpnes or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

according to <hi>Galen. prima particula. prognoſticorum.</hi> And as dead bodies are layde forth vpon their backs: ſo the lying of ſicke and weake bodies, muſt be vpon their broadeſt part, which is the back.

               <p>If the partie that is to bleede be fearfull, turne his face away to the contrarie ſide, &amp; let his minde be drawen by other talke of the ſtanders by from the preſent practiſe of the Phlebotomer. The member that is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, muſt hang downward, that the courſe of the bloud may be direct and eaſie for that part which we deſire moſt to euacuat. Then that part of the member which we meane to take: as of arme, thigh, hande, or foote: muſt bee rubbed, to drawe the bloud vnto that part, euen vntill it waxe hote. Next wee take a ſtrong bond &amp; binde it next aboue the place, whoſe veine muſt be taken, that the bloud comming downe, the veine may ſwell and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in ſight.

               <p>The quantitie of bloud paſſed forth is to be conſidered, as wee ſhewed before 14 &amp; 15 Chapters, that it may be ſtayed in due time: &amp; in this behalfe therof two regards are to be had eſpecially. Firſt, the neceſsitie of the diſeaſe. Secondly, the conſtancie &amp; firmenes of natural ſtrength: wherof looke in the foreſaid places more at large. After good bloud apeares, bleed no more for feare of the crampe, convulſion, palſie, dropſie, &amp; ſuch like. In a ſimple pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to auoid imminent dangers, it ſhal be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient only to abate the abundance: albeit, a mediocritie ſtil remain. But in an vniuerſal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, as is a feuer; a mediocritie will not ſerue, but bloud is abated more then ſo. And in infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations we are not only to regard the quantity but in like maner the alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the colour &amp;

For alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of colour ſheweth that the ſame bloud (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the other that good is) proceeded from the inflamed part. If the humor cleaue faſt to the member, or that by euacuation the ſtrength of nature bee waſted, then wee are vrged to ſtay bleeding, before the bloud doo chaunge in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and to detract that which remaineth by reiterating <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> either the ſame day, or the day after. <hi>Hyppocrates, 2. vict. acuto. 10.</hi> In the cure of the Plureſie writeth, that in the cure of that diſeaſe, the inner veyne of the arme is ſpeedily to be opened, and bloud plentifully to be withdrawen vntill the ſame appeare far red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than it did at the firſt: or that for pure and red bloud, the ſame appeare ſwart and blacke, which both happen in Pluriſies.

To theſe may bee added, the hicket: and a deſire to vomit, which commeth of fluxe of the humor, to the mouth of the ſtomacke, as were already ſhewed. But the moſt certaine and aſſured marke, is the alteration of the Pulſe, which changing from thicke to ſlow, from great to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, from ſtrong to weake, from equall to vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall; prognoſticate defect of nature, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation in the body, not much vnlike <hi>Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia:</hi> that is, the falling ſickenes. If theſe come through feare, or of humors nipping the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke; ſtay bleeding, recreate and ſtrengthen the Pacient a while: that afterward the reſidue of the euacuation, may be perfected.</p>
               <p>The waies to recouer and fetch ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if the ſame giue ouer before a conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and commodious quantity of bloud may be taken, are theſe: to caſt colde water on the face of the Pacient: to ſprinckle vppon the face white odoriferous wine, to put to the noſe of the ſame party, vineger, ſtrong wine, muske, or

But to auoide all theſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, the remedy is to let bloud, the party ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his bed, for ſo the partes of the body are reduced into one equality of poſition, whereby the principall parts mutually beſtow one on an other inward heat and vitall ſpirits: if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient bee not brought againe by the foreſaide thinges, then prouoke vomit by tickling in the throat, or by pouring in a litle oile, for the force of vomiting ſtirreth vp ſtrength, and draweth away weakeneſſe of the ſtomacke and heart, and preſently after recouery, renue the ſtrength of nature, with wine, iuce of Pomgranats, broth of fleſh, with the receit called Diamo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The inſtrument may bee annointed with oile, or other ſuch liquor, that it may inflict the wound without paine, and for the moſt part the wounde muſt bend ſomewhat aſlaunt or croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly. The inciſion is made two waies, as <hi>Hyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> ſaith: one ſtraight <hi>Secundum rectum,</hi> or <hi>Edirecto,</hi> downeright: the other contrary crookedly, or a ſwaſh. In theſe two waies wee muſt vſe great diſcretion, to vſe them as neede requireth, and not deceiue our ſelues, vſing the one, when wee ſhould the other, (as many are deceiued in theſe daies.) To ſhewe which of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3763:110"/>
theſe is to bee preferred, would require a long diſcourſe, whereof read at large, <hi>Fuchſius</hi> in his Apologie againſt <hi>Brachelius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is newe kinde of inſtruments to let bloud withall nowe a daies: as the Rapier, Sword, and long Dagger; which bring the bloud letters ſometime to the Gallowes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſtrike too deepe. Theſe inſtruments are the Ruffians weapons, more malitious than manly. But in this practiſe the veyne muſt be opened with a fine Launcet, no fleme with a beard like a bloud-iron wherewith Smiths let horſes bloud, for they will ſometime cut a veyn thorough on both ſides, cauſing a crampe and deadly convulſion. And here I giue aduiſe, that no Surgion except he be very skilfull himſelfe, open any veyne without the counſaile of the learned Phiſition, or the iudgement of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that haue auncient and tried experience in the practiſe. Ignorant Barbers doo great hurt herein, taking that which comes to hand firſt, or which appeareth greateſt (perhaps a ſinew for a veyne) ſo letting out the vitall ſpirits, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling many: and when it is done, this is all their defence, to ſay the ſigne was there, and he would needs be let bloud.</p>
               <p>Vnction or annointing, is oft vſed in this practiſe: ſometime we rub the member, whoſe veyne is to be taken with oile, that thorough the warmth thereof, bloud may bee made the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:3763:111"/>
more flowing: ſometime the inſtrument is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, as was ſaide before, to mittigate the paine of the inflicted wound. Sometime the wound it ſelfe is annointed, that it may bee the longer time, before it bee couered with the Scarre, and that the humors left behinde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may with the more liberty breath foorth, and that the ill humors remaining, may bee alſo the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſperſed.</p>
               <p>Drinke, and eſpecially wine, may bee very well taken both in the bleeding, if Syncope happen, and after bleeding, to cauſe good bloud, and to recouer againe the vitall ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Bathing two or three daies before, is vſed in ſome cauſes (as was declared in the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) but not the ſelfe ſame day.</p>
               <p>The common opinion is, that bleeding muſt be done faſting, and vppon an empty ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke: but this is not approoued of the beſt writers, for many of them giue aduiſe to eate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bleeding a ſoft or poched egge, with a draught of wine about nine or ten of the clocke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For nature (the ſtomacke being empty, and being altogether deſtitute of nouriſhment) doth mightily holdfaſt, and retaine the bloud: whereas when a little nouriſhment is taken in ſmall quantitie, as is a poched egge, &amp; a draught of wine; ſhee permitteth the bloud eaſily to paſſeforth.</p>

After bleeding lye a while on the backe, for quietnes ſake, and to recreate the ſtrength of nature, and to recouer the vitall ſpirits.

For the bloud and ſpirits naturall, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and animall which haue of late bin vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently ſtirred by bleeding, are now by reſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to be ſetled: elſe the ſame bloud and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites would by theſe outward vehement exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, bee inflamed, and ſo waſt and conſume away.

Let him therefore watch, and reſt void of contention, either in mind or in body. When an houre or two is paſt after bleeding, a litle meate may bee giuen him: Little (I ſay) in quantity, but of good iuice, to nouriſh the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:3763:113"/>

Afterward the diet muſt bee increaſed by little and little, both in reſpect of the quantity, and of the goodnes of the meat. Neither as yet muſt we haſten to a full diet, for the heat of nature being abated by bleeding, can not as yet receiue or digeſt aboundance of meat.

Therefore after bleeding the patient is to liue more finely and exquiſitly, and not to goe to his old intemperat diet againe, as the dog to his vomit.

The member of the bodie that is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with griefe or corruption, by little and little, euen in one day or two daies at the moſt, ſendeth downe the humours to the place where the inciſion was.

               <p>But neither muſt reiterating of bleeding be vſed: For thereby the vitall ſpirites, and in ward heate is diminiſhed, and vntimely age is haſtened on apace, and the ſame when it commeth is made ſubiect to greeuous diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as <hi>Chachexia,</hi> the dropſie, gout in the iointes, trembling, palſies, and apoplexies.

whereby (as all men know) the life commeth into great danger. Againe, another diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity by ſleeping immediatly after bleeding is: that fumous excrementes through ſleepe are againe inwardly reuoked to the principall members.</p>
               <p>Againe, the vitall ſpirits, and natural heat, which by opening of a veine, are drawen to the outward partes and members, by ſleepe are reuoked to the center, or middes of the bodie: and ſo very often, partly through a commotion made by inciſion, and partly through that retraction made by ſleepe: ſuch a boiling happeneth in the humours of the body, that oft therby at length a feuer is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and kindled. It is therefore apparant, that ſleepe preſently after bleeding is not good, and chiefly if in the meane ſeaſon the patient haue receiued no meat. If after taking of meat hee ſleepe an houre or two, or more (diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo ſeruing) it hurteth not at all, or verie little.</p>
               <p>But for as much as the commotion of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours can not fully be ſetled in ſhort ſpace af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bleeding, it is far ſafer to forbeare ſleepe, as we haue proued by ſundry reaſons.

further reaſon, yet of the fore ſaid, namely, why we ſhould not preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſleep after bleeding &amp; that is: becauſe the matter through ſleep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thicke, and ſo a bruſing or a confraction that way happeneth in the members: as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed in a quartan, through the thicknes &amp; coldnes of the matter. Againe the veines &amp; ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes after bleeding, being now emptied, are becom cold, &amp; ſo the fumes which are brought vnto the veines and ſinewes in ſleepe, do alſo be come thicke and waxe colde: becauſe by ſleepe the whole naturall heat of the bodie is drawen euen into the depth and profunditie of the bodily partes. And when the veines and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes are become cold, partly for defect of bloud, partly through cold fumes brought by ſleepe vnto them: they doo participate groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, coldnes, &amp; confraction to the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: for it is a principle, <hi>Simile a ſimili facile afficit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The wound in the arme after bleeding ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time healeth but ſlowly, becauſe the inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was annoynted with oyle, as wee ſaid before, that the ſame might enter the better &amp; do leſt hurt to the pacient, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith <hi>9.

Another cauſe why after bleeding the wound cloſeth but ſoftly is, that there hath bin too much euacuation of bloud, whereby the force of nature is debilitated, which hindereth the continuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or conſolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wound. A third reaſon hereof may be, the oft mouing of the arme: for wounds do neuer heale, except the member enioy reſt, where they are inflicted.

               <p>That revulſion which is made by opening <hi>Baſilica</hi> in the arme (ſpecially the right <hi>Baſilica)</hi> is to be accounted generall: becauſe it draweth from the Liuer (which is the fountaine it ſelfe) from whence all fluxe of bloud commeth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame bee fluxe of termes, or any other fluxe of bloud.</p>
               <p>Revulſion made from the lower veynes, is particuler: not euacuating firſt from the Liuer, the fountaine of bloud, as the other doth.

               <p>If there be any inflamation in or about the bely, at the biginning thereof, draw the matter vpward, and that directly: For from aboue, as from the head, the fluxe proceedeth.

               <p>Affects in any part vnder the raines, are moſt ſpeedily cured by opening the greater veines of the hamme: the ſame are cured ſlowly, and with leſſe ſpeede, by opening <hi>Saphena</hi> in the ankle.

in the vpper partes are cured, by vpper veines, opened in the arme: ſo they in the nether partes, are cured by lower veines, opened in the hammes and ankles.</p>
               <p>As wee haue hitherto declared the veines in generall &amp; particular, with their profits in bleeding, for manifold diſeaſes: So alſo, to the intent that the practiſioner may be furniſhed throughly with knowledge in this point which is the moſt principal: and to know in euery diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe what veine to open, &amp; ſo not to take Hob for Gib (as the prouerb ſaith:) it ſhall not be greatly amiſſe for the more perfectnes herein, to teach this leſſon forward and backward, as they learne their <hi>Gamma vt,</hi> both waies; that intend to be good Muſicians: ſo muſt thoſe be moſt perfect in this diſcourſe, that in this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of letting bloud will be accounted skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and good Phiſicions.

               <p>Concerning a pacient ſicke and diſeaſed, &amp; the curatiue intention of this practiſe: If he be ſicke, he is diſeaſed alſo, either in the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, or in ſome particular part: If the diſeaſe lye in the whole bodie, then the <hi>Baſilica</hi> or inner veine of the arme is to be opened, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly anſwereth vnto the Liuer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the verie fountaine of bloud.</p>

Of theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle veſſels, there muſt be many in number, that in each of them, the varietie of the bloud may appeare and be ſeene: and they are to be ſet in a faire place, that no duſt, ſmoke, winde, or Sunne, come vnto them. The firſt obſeruation<note place="margin">1. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanti.</note> is the ſubſtance of the bloud, which ſometime is viſcous, &amp; cleaueth to the fingers like glue;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:3763:136"/>
this floweth out but ſoftly and ſlowly, becauſe it is thicke, and it quickly againe congeleth. This kind of bloud is the cauſe of obſtructions in the body, and of ſuch diſeaſes as are cauſed by obſtructions. That bloud which congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not ſo ſoon in the porringer, is thin bloud. And that which waxeth not hard, being cold: is watriſh and putrified bloud. Thicke &amp; viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous bloud, and compacted hard, is hardly cut or diuided, &amp; thin bloud very eaſily: putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bloud not at all: but as ſoone as it is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with ones finger, or a knife, it is torne &amp; rent (as it were) into ſmall pieces.</p>

For theſe diſeaſes cauſe aboundance of watry wheyiſh matter in the veines, mingled with the bloud.

The colour of the congealed bloud, being very red in the top, ſheweth a good profitable qloud. The colour red and cleere, ſheweth hot bloud: as that of the arteries. An obſcure red colour expreſſeth a mean or mediocritie, as is the colour of the bloud in the veines.

A mixture of diuers colours, ſheweth aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of diuers humours: whether the colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red humors be putrified or no, the ſubſtance of the bloud declareth. White colour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of good concoction, chiefly in thoſe that haue full ſtrength: whoſe vrins appeare well concoct, with moſt white reſidencies in the bottom. The bloud of ſuch perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the veines through concoction waxe white. If the bloud be white in colour, &amp; viſcous in ſubſtance: it ſignifieth aduſt flegme, by reaſon of burning heat in the ſame. If it bee not viſcous, but thin &amp; wat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iſh, it ſheweth natural flegme. The beſt colour in bloud is red, inclining to a certaine obſcurity or darknes. Purple colour very thin &amp; cleer, ſheweth choler as <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſeth <hi>inpri. de Chriſi.</hi> If it be very dark, it betokeneth groſſe bloud. Greene bloud ſheweth perfect aduſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:3763:137"/>
When the bloud floweth ſoorthſpedely, it is ſuetile and thin: when it ſpinneth not foorth, but comes guttatim, ſlowly drop by drop: it betokeneth that it is groſſe bloud: when mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betweene both, then is it a mean bloud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene groſſe and thin. Againe ſometime it is quickly congeled, then is it g roſſe bloud: ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſlowly compacted, and then is it ſubtile. Thicke and groſſe bloud, ſheweth thicke and groſſe matter in the bodie: or it ſheweth great heat and drith, which hath conſumed the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity of bloud. If it be ſubtile &amp; thin, it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth want of digeſtion, and abundance of raw, vnconcocted humours, of hot humours, or of cold, as the colour ſhall diſcrie.</p>
               <p>If the bloud be oily, it betokeneth either a future leproſie, or too much fatnes in the body: for leproſy is cauſed of extremity of heat in the bloud, burning the ſame, and conuerting it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an oily ſubſtance. Againe, take a bat round in the end, and ſet it to the congeled bloud, if it withſtand it not, but giue place vnto it, and bee diuided: it is an argument of drith. If the bloud greatly reſiſt the entrance of the bat, then is it a very thicke and viſcous bloud. If be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then is it a meane bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thus of the ſubſtance of the bloud, which ſhould haue bin inſerted before.

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:3763:138"/>
here yet in good ſort a good bloud is of diuers colours, according to the diuerſitie of the parts: for in the vpper parte and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the veſſell, it is of a red colour: for the good bloud (being light) alwaies aſcendeth vp to the higher partes: in the middes it is red, and not cleere: in the bottom it is blacke and melancolious. For melancoly (being heauy) reſteth alwaies in the bottome.</p>

                     </gap>. Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedo.</note> Sometime there ſwimmeth on the toppe of the bloud a certaine fatte, or oily matter, like a copweb. If the body bee very groſſe and fat: this is cauſed of the verie bloud, which is in ſuch bodies inclining to fat. If the body be very leane, it declareth the ſame now to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne<note place="margin">8. Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia.</note> to melt, and to languiſh.</p>
               <p>In the bottom of the clodded bloud there is reſident an earthly &amp; a filthy ſubſtance, which being deuided, or clouen aſunder, appeareth in colour, either red, darke, blacke, bright, or greene: whereby we may coniecture the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the humour mixt with the bloud: yea &amp; by the colour much or little, we may know, how much ech humour aboundeth in the veines.</p>
               <p>Some ſay, if the bloud bee cut or deuided, &amp;<note place="margin">7. Grana.</note> that there bee found in the ſame, certaine grainees like ſmall ſande, that it noteth le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, or inclination vnto it: which alwaies hath not been found true by certaine that
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:3763:138"/>
haue obſerued it.</p>
               <p>It is ſildome, that the bloud comming from the veines, doth ſinke: but if it doo, the ſame ſheweth corrupt and ſtinking humours, and is a token of vncurable putrifaction and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <p>No man doth willingly taſt detracted bloud, but if by chaunce it come into the mouth, and doo taſt ſweet, it is according to nature, good, and of perfect concoction. If it bee bitter in taſt, it ſheweth aboundance of choller: if it be ſowre, ſharpe, and reſtringent, it denotateth aboundance of melancoly: if vnſauery, aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of flegme: if ſalt, the bloud is mixt with ſalt flegme. After obſeruation of the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and colour of the bloud, conferre all the ſmal porringers, or veſſels of bloud together. If they ſhew all equally good bloud, it is to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that the reſt in the veines, is like vnto it. Yet the ſame is to bee withdrawen, if it offend in quantity, and greeue the body, hurting the ſences, and cauſing in the body putrifaction and other euils. If bloud appeare corrupt, then with a greater profit, the ſame is to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe it hurteth the body two waies: both with the quantity and qualitie thereof. If it be not ſufficiently withdrawen at one time, afterward againe, a veine muſt be opened: and beſide bleeding, if Cacochymia concur with plenitud: that is, that bloud offend both in
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:3763:139"/>
quantitie and qualitie, as wee noted in the 21. Chapter: beſide bleeding, the body muſt more ouer be purged with inward medicine.</p>
               <p>If that bloud which came firſt were good, and the other corrupt: then ſuppoſe that yet much ſuch bloud remaineth in the bodie, to be auoided by good order of diet, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euacuation. But if it fall out ſo in inflamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is a good ſigne that the euacuation is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and perfect: quite taking away the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the diſeaſe from the affected member. The bloud poured into warme water, hath thereby his partes and ſubſtances deuided: the wheyiſh and watrìe ſubſtance is confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the water, and cannot be knowen from it. Alſo the thinner and more ſubtile part of the bloud is mingled with the water likewiſe: whereby yet notwithſtanding after a ſort, wee may giue iudgement of the nature of the humor. The thicker parte of the bloud reſteth in the bottome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is reputed good and naturall bloud: if ſo be it be whitiſh, thinne, bright, and cohering together. If the ſame be more groſſe, it ſheweth the groſneſſe of the bloud that remaineth in the bodie. If it be obſcure, blacke, or otherwiſe coloured, after the difference of the colour, iudge the bloud to be corrupted, or not corrupted with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

vncurable putrifaction.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, remember that the more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and vnconcocted the bloud appeareth, being altered from the nature of good bloud, the ſame is to be withdrawen in the leſſe quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, and not ſo plentifully, as when the ſame draweth more nigh the ſubſtance of good bloud: which is done otherwiſe, and quite contrarie by our common barbors and letters of bloud. And looke howe much the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors doe paſſe and exceede, either leſſe or more, the nature of bloud: ſo much more ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, are wee to let bloud. And when they exceede too farre from the nature of bloud, either the one waie or the other: then wee are altogether to forbeare bleeding, as wee haue noted in a certeine place alreadie.</p>

               <p>VVithout theſe dangers we may cut the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer arteries, which are in the outwarde lims or members: as in the head, hands, and feete.

The cauſe of theſe pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king paines, is abundance of much thinne hot bloud, incloſed in the arteries of the pained place, and the ſame is taken away, when the outward arteries, are found out and cut, which proceede from thoſe inwarde affected mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>

               <p>TO this diſcourſe of opening a veyne, which is a generall euacuation of bloud, is to bee added, the particuler euacuation thereof, by leaches and ventoſas: whereof wee will briefly ſpeake in theſe two Chapters, and ſo conclude this our preſent Pamphlet.</p>
               <p>VVhen bloud is ſo in any member, that it cannot be pulled backe by opening of a veyne or by ſome other practiſe: the ſame is to bee withdrawen from the affected member, by ſuch remedies, as may outwardly abide vpon the griefe, and ſo free the ſame of the preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. Of this ſort are Leaches. Launſing, cupping or boxing: which apparantly drawe bloud, from the member affected.</p>
               <p>Leaches or bloudſuckers, are wormes found in waters, which applied outwardly to the member, draw forth bloud: They make a three ſquare wound, which penetrateth not only the skinne, but alſo more deepely if the skinne bee tender<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as is the skin of children and infants.) Theſe being empty and well applied, ſucke out bloud greedily and ſafely, and that ſo long, till they ſwell with fulneſſe, and ſo fall off: And ſometime when they are off, the bloud ſtill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth plentifully, eſpecially if they were fixed
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:3763:144"/>
vpon ſo open and manifeſt veyne: In which caſe, they ſtand in ſteede of <hi>Phlebotomy.</hi> Thus applied to the hemeroide veynes, ſometime they doo ſo prouoke bloud, that to ſtoppe the ſame, we are neceſſarily forced to vſe thinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent: yea, and applied to the arme of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they are equall to bleeding: And that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction which is thus drawen from a hollo we veyne, is to bee accounted for an vniuerſall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacuation. But when they are fixed to the hard skinne vnder which there is no great veyne, they onely empty that place that theſe touch: extracting very litle from the neerer parts, and nothing at all from the members far off. And therefore leaches are onely vſuall in corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the vppermoſt skinne: as in the ſcab in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itiligo,</hi> which is a fowlenes of the body with ſpots of diuers colours, whereof are three kinds: In <hi>Impetigo</hi> a diſeaſe which wee call the Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worme. In the diſeaſe called <hi>Panus,</hi> which after <hi>Celſus</hi> is a kind of kernell growing in the grind of a man, or behinde his eares: In rednes of the noſe and face, and little ſwellinges in leaprous perſons. So oftentimes wee apply them to the Arſe-hole called <hi>Anus,</hi> againſt melancholly diſeaſes, cauſed of the ſtopping of hemorroids. In ſcabs, itch, and wicked wounds, they are very profitable: the body beeing firſt euacuated by letting of bloud. Yea, the drawing of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaches is more conuenient in fulnes of bloud,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:3763:145"/>
than ſcarrifieng is: Foraſmuch as they fetch bloud more deepely, and alſo that which is withdrawen by Leaches, is more of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of bloud: Albeit the opinion of ſome is, that they drawe no bloud, but corrupt bloud; and ſuch as is not agreeable, and proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto our bodies. And therefore in griefes which happen betweene the skin and the fleſh, of bloud corrupted, theſe are more conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent than ſcarrifieng.</p>
               <p>The attracting of bloud by Ventoſas and horſeleaches, hath this difference: that theſe drawe more deepely from the body: Ventoſas but from the ſuperficiall partes. Therefore let Leaches bee applyed to thoſe places, from whence we would drawe humors more deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>Their vſe and application is this: Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they bee put to any part of the body, they muſt be kept all one day before, and nouriſhed with a little bloud, which wee may giue them in a little piece of freſh fleſh: then we muſt put them, and keepe them in cleane water, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what warmed: and before we vſe them, with a ſpunge wipe away the skinne that is about them: Rubbe the part of the member affected whereto you will apply them with ſalt: or ſcratch the ſame till it looke red: or annoint the ſame with a little freſh bloud. Some lay on them a ſpunge, that when they be full, they may
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:3763:145"/>
fall away. They are with moſt ſafety let downe in a reede or a pipe to the affected mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, leſt they might touch together, and ſo by that meanes of ende thoſe partes that are ſounde and whole. And firſt before you apply them, ſo preſſe them and wring them out, that they may vtter and caſt forth all their venome, ſo as their backes bee greene, and their bellies reddiſh.</p>
               <p>VVee are to chooſe ſuch Leaches as are not in fowle troubled blacke waters: nor ſuch as haue long rayes or ſtrikes in them, like roddes: called <hi>Hyrudines <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgulatae.</hi> Nor ſuch as are of the colour of <hi>Lapis Lazulus:</hi> for theſe are venemous. But wee are to chooſe them, that bee redde, inclining to the colour of the Lyuer, hauing two redde lines or ſtrikes: or inclining to a certaine greenneſſe, hauing little heads, and beeing very ſlender, and had out of cleare flowing waters.

               <head>Of Cupping, or boxing &amp; ſcarification, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two particular euacuations of bloud. Chap. 27.</head>
               <p>FOraſmuch as it is not conuenient to be let bloud oft times in the yeare: for that much of the vitall ſpirit paſſeth forth with the bloud, and that the blould being taken away, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy waxeth colde, and the operations of nature become weake and enfeebled (as we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a certeine place declared:) therefore I counſell (ſaith <hi>Galen)</hi> that the baſer partes of the bodie, as the legges, be boxed or cupped, which is the moſt ſure remedie, as well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue health, as to repaire the ſame being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed.</p>
               <p>For it cureth the eyes annoyed with long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillations. It profiteth alſo the head, &amp; vpper partes of the bodie, as the breſt and backe, and againſt ſundrie other diſeaſes. For in what member ſo euer the bloud is gathered, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die being firſt purged by cupping, the griefe may be cured. Alſo <hi>Oribaſius</hi> affirmeth, that it helpeth Quincies in the throat: diſſolueth ſtoppings of all places. Notwithſtanding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of boxes about the ſtomack, in hote feuers, where reaſon is troubled, are to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed, for feare of ſuffocation. Likewiſe, put vnto the head vndiſcreetly, they hurt both
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:3763:147"/>
the head and the eyes.</p>
               <p>Boxing helpeth ſwellings, letteth foorth winde, ſtoppeth immoderate Termes, and the bloudie flixe: helpeth appetite: when a woman ſowneth, it reuiueth her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

VVhich effectes ſhall hereafter be reheaſed, with their cures by this practiſe more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>There are three cauſes which perſwade vs
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:3763:147"/>
to vſe this practiſe, and to refraine letting of bloud.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe our purpoſe is to euacuate from ſome one member, and not from another: and therefore particular euacuation is done by boxing or <hi>Cucurbitulas,</hi> which they that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low barbarous authors in Pinſicke doe alſo call <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>entoſas.</hi> Nowe particular euacuation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made by Phlebotomy: for the ſame euacuateth and emptieth from the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe the ſtrength is weake, or the age vnfit to bleed: or that there is ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe impediments ſpoken of in the 8 Chapter. For as <hi>Rhazes</hi> ſayeth in <hi>7 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>entoſas</hi> drawe bloud but from the little veines: and therefore the heat and ſpirites are thereby but a little dimini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hed: whereas opening of a veine greatly debilitateth nature, drawing from the greater veines with the bloud, much heat &amp; vitall ſpirites.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe our intent is to euacuate onely from the baſer members. Bleeding euacuateth from the moſt noble members, and greater veines: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>entoſas</hi> from the meane members, and little ſmall veines, which arein the outward bodily partes, and lye without the greater veines.</p>
               <p>Of boxings there are two ſortes, the one gentle without ſcarification or launcing: the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:3763:148"/>
other with ſcarification, which both in ſteede of bloud-letting are vſed, when age, debilitie, the time of the yeare, or other conſiderations will not permit the op ening of a veine. Hereby is produced the thinne bloud next the skinne: and being preſently vſed after ſcarification, when little inciſions and holes are made in the member, that bloud and humors may eaſily come foorth: it mightily withdraweth by force and flame of heat, not onely the thinne &amp; flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing humors and ſpirites which are about the member after ſcarifying, but alſo that which is in places further diſtant. If the skinne (I ſay) be firſt exaſperated with the Iron, it doth this that wee heare ſpeake of more manifeſtly. If the skinne be whole and not ſcarified, it prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth bloud and humors from the furtheſt parts into the skinne, and bringeth it to that parte, whereunto the cupping boxes are applyed. The cupping glaſſe infixed (the skinne being incided or launced) purgeth the outmoſt parts of the body more mightily, than if to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects wee onely vſed either ſcarification, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leches.</p>
               <p>Boxings without ſcarification, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led eaſie cuppings, do not apparantly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe bloud, but only the ſpirites: yet it doth pull backe vnto it humors, and forcible fluxes: and applyed to the contrarie part, it ſtayeth ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of bloud in any place whereſoeuer:
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:3763:148"/>
chiefely, when infirmitie of ſtrength will not permit revulſion, by opening of a veine. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer it ſtayeth fluxes of the wombe, or of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors: and applyed to the member where the fluxe of humors is, it turneth the ſame anothet way. Alſo, it prouoketh outwardly that fluxe of humors which lyeth deep in the bodie: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſerueth as a remedie in aſtoniſhmentes, palſies, &amp; in veterat paines: it waſteth winde &amp; ſpirites, included in any member: and therefore quickly ſtayeth tremblings or pantings of the heart, or elſe-where within the bodie, the hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, colick, &amp; paines of the raines. And this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent kind of remedie, is without daunger: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurting the bodie, nor weakening the ſtrength.</p>
               <p>That eaſie &amp; light boxings are beſt for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, as to pull back Termes, appeareth by <hi>Hippo. 5. Aphoriſ. Aphoriſ. 50. Simulieri men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrua ſistere volueris, Cucurbitulam quam maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam, ſub mammis defige.</hi> If thou wouldſt ſtay Termes in a woman, apply a good great cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping glaſſe neare or aboue her pappes. And <hi>Galen. 5. lib. Ther. Metho.</hi> with eaſie boxing, applyed <hi>Hypocondiis.</hi> i. the ſides &amp; ſhort ribbs, aboue the nauill, where the Liuer lyeth on the right ſide, and the Splene on the left: affirmeth bleeding at the noſe to be ſtayed, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed on the Liuer, or right <hi>Hypocondrion,</hi> if the fluxe come foorth of the right noſthrill, and on
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:3763:149"/>
the left <hi>Hypocondrion,</hi> and on the Splene: if from the left, and vpon them both, if it proceed from both the noſthri's.</p>
               <p>Againe, gentle cupping is vſed in ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as are alreadie euacuated, in ſtuffed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, wee vſe them not, nor in inflamed mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, nor in the beginning of other affectes, but where as nothing elſe hath beene before, or where the bodie hath beene alreadie eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated.</p>
               <p>In this caſe of revulſion by cupping without ſcarification, as in fluxe of Termes, as ye heard out of <hi>Hippo,</hi> and in fluxe of bloud from the noſe, as ye heard out of <hi>Galen,</hi> be verie cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect to apply the cupping glaſſes on the member ſet ouer againſt the place, from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wee purpoſe to pul-backe, according to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of poſition: that the place cupped may haue agreement with the place, from whence wee purpoſe to reuoke. Otherwiſe wee doe no good, as we ſhewed before, ſpeaking of revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in bleeding, Chap. 6.</p>
               <p>Againe, gentle cupping is vſed without ſcari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, when wee will drawe humors from deepe and inward partes of the bodie to the outward members. Therefore <hi>Galen. 13. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. Medend.</hi> ſaith: that it is <hi>caeteris attractiuis fortius:</hi> ſtronger than any other attractiues: thus in harde apoſtumations, it draweth the matter outward: yea, and by it, hard apoſtumations
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:3763:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may be remoued, if generall euacuation haue gone before, according as the fulneſſe in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient requireth.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is vſed without ſcarification when we ſtay any member, or bring a member to his proper place. Thus when the bowels fal down, we applie <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>entoſas</hi> aboue the bellie, to reteine them or bring them back.</p>
               <p>Alſo, it is vſed without ſcarification, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue windines, as in the collick: ſo a cer em fat woman troubled with the collick, tooke two narrow mouthed pots, &amp; did put them magret braſen veſſel, &amp; ſhe did put the veſſel of braſſe to the fire, &amp; afterward applyed the two hot pots to her bellie: firſt couering the ſame with alynnen cloth, &amp; ſo ſhee was healed.</p>
               <p>Item, it is vſed without ſcarification to mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate paines, &amp; that in all apoſtumations and colliks generally, whether the ſame be cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Alſo when the parts are filled with ſharp mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or outwardly infected with venome: or when we will draw the matter from one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to another. Alſo, it is vſed with ſcarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſharpe diſeaſes, when the ſtrength is weake, and nature not able to tollerate blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And thus you haue heard, in what caſes boxing is vſed without ſcarifying, &amp; with ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying, which is a worthie and profitable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation.</p>
               <p>The difference betweene <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>entoſas &amp; Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy</hi> is, that Phlebotomy euacuateth the groſſe bloud, and the other ſubtile and thinne bloud.

Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy all the humors indifferently, and <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſas,</hi> or attraction <hi>per vacuum,</hi> that humor that is moſt ſubtile and thinne among them all in that part.</p>
               <p>The difference betweene the attraction made by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>entoſas,</hi> and that made by leaches is this: that the leaches drawe humors from the profound and deepe places, and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>entoſas</hi> but from the ſuperficiall partes.</p>
               <p>Item, fat perſons are not to vſe cupping: for it is with them, as with water pypes in the ground, which being filled and ſtopped with
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:3763:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>
earth or other matter, ſtay the water courſe that it cannot run: ſo the veynes in the body, are like thoſe water pipes, and are ſometime ſo filled with fleſhy fat, that the bloud cannot haue his courſe thorow them, and therefore the veynes in fat folke, beeing either ſo ſtrict, or ſo ſtopped, the Ventoſas cannot withdrawe from them, but with great violence: and if they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract any thing, it is the moſt ſubtile bloud, the groſſe bloud cannot paſſe thorow the ſtopped places.</p>
               <p>Concerning the time, they are not to bee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the new of the moone, becauſe then the humors are quiet, and ſo hardly drawen, nor in the laſt quarter: for this ſeaſon being cold, the humors are not eaſily attracted: but in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſeaſon: when the humors are flowing, and are not too colde: and vſe them in the third houre of the day, for then by reaſon of heate, the poores are opened, and the bloud beeing then eaſily mooueable, is with the more facility attracted to the members, and from the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</p>
               <p>After bathings we are not to vſe them, for there were to bee feared, too great a fluxe of bloud, yet if we can perceiue the bloud to bee too groſſe, wee may to ſubtiliate the ſame, vſe bathing before in ſuch a caſe, as was ſaide in the rules of <hi>Phlebotomy.</hi>

               <p>Thus cupping reuoketh bloud at the noſe, as yee heard aboue out of <hi>Galen,</hi> by applying the <hi>Ventoſas</hi> vnto the ſides: that is, vpon the Lyuer and right ſide, if out of the right noſethrills, &amp; <hi>contra,</hi> as before.</p>
