            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Introduction.</head>
            <p>SINCE Living in an Age
in which the Minds of Men
are so passionately divided,
that they are apt, of all sides,
not only to Condemn whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103977:4"/>
is not suitable to the Noise
they make, but wrest out forc'd
Constructions far, perhaps, from
the meaning of him that either
writ or said the words, and where
'tis possible to turn Censure into
Accusation. I thought it not
improper therefore, at least, of
State-Criticks, by giving a short
Account, by way of Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
why I chose History as the
most useful Study, and something
of our own most proper for our
selves, where the Prospect of
things past under the same Laws
and Government that we now
enjoy, must also probably be the
most useful part of History to
us. For if the Revolution and
Event of things are the best In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
the Impressions may
probably be the most effectual,
where our Actions are Precedents
to our selves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:103977:4"/>
I have also often consider'd,
since riper years have admitted a
full consideration, what Hazard
any man undergoes, that exposes
publickly the Endeavours of an
improved Knowledge, though
with a design to present to others
those advantages that he believes
he has acquired to himself by the
most industrious and impartial
searches. And indeed 'tis not
only the Intention of doing
well, that will procure an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
for Errors committed, but
joyn'd to a fair performance, will
hardly find a just acceptance;
and every man by reason of Self-inclination,
is as much unfit to be
a Judge of his own Productions,
as generally men, by the averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the Reputation of others,
are improper to bring in their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts.</p>
            <p>The
same Inclination and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that guide what any man
writes, will probably make him
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103977:5"/>
approve what he has written; so
that indeed a man has past his
Judgment at first, and can hardly
have a separate Opinion left at
last: For when he has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to apply his best Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he must be disentangled from
his own Nature, to have another
Judgment. Fathers that beget
Children, may fancy that to be
Wit and Diversion in them,
which perhaps disinterested per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
would judge troublesome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies.</p>
            <p>On
the other side, those that are
not byass'd by any particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
and shou'd be most capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to judge, are yet as much
bent with the apprehension of
the Reputation of others, as they
are by the fondness of gaining it:
as if any were robb'd of what
was due to their own merits,
by others receiving the reward
of theirs. One Candle may il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate
a Thousand, without
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103977:5"/>
the loss of Light; and in esteem
no man loses by what another
shares. But Jealousie that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbs
the Peace of Life, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the Disquiet in Mens Minds,
and Disturbance is the Product
of ill Nature; so that men are
prepared rather to censure than
judge. Besides, in giving Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the Party, there seems
a tacite submission to his; but
Censure seems a preference to
their own: So that by searching
out faults in others, they give
Evidence (as they think) of their
own Correctness. Whereas, if
those that endeavour to be Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious,
were to attempt the same
thing, they might perhaps shew
as many failings; and the others
that shou'd enter upon their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Province, might perhaps
successfully exceed them in search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for Defects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:103977:6"/>
This is the Cause why the best
Performances have not that Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Justice bestowed upon
them while the Author lives,
which after his Death they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
Many excellent Painters,
who during Life, did not gain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
extraordinary Wealth or Fame,
after Death their Works increas'd
alike into an extream of Price
and Reputation: for they cou'd
then be no Rivals, and those that
were jealous, they might darken
their Reputations while living,
now believ'd it might be a safe
Testimony of their own Skill, to
admire the Art of those that were
dead.</p>
            <p>'Twere too long and needless
to name the Writings of many
that were little regarded at the
time they were written; nay,
some censured, some absolutely
condemned, which in future times
grew into Credit, and by labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Commentaries, great Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103977:6"/>
and heights of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
have been endeavoured
to be discovered, which perhaps
were never design'd or thought
of by the Authors. But when
they were not capable to receive
any Benefit of a Reputation,
'twas then search'd out for them,
to make their Writings useful to
the Fame and Interest of others.
For when by Distance of time
there seems a Traditional Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
descending with the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
many have curiously la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
how to bring this to the
use of their Arguments and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
and, to gain the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
fix'd the Name of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
to that which was perform'd
rather in the Infancy os Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>From
this general, and no very
pleasant Consideration, I enter'd
into the particular Parts of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and in the first place seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
weigh'd those searches I had
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103977:7"/>
made in <hi>Divinity,</hi> and I perceiv'd
nothing so easie, nor so useful, as
the Gospel Part of it, which
shou'd have been the whole: For
I thought all things necessary
were so fully and clearly laid
down there, that it did not need
Disputes, nor cou'd reasonably
cause men to differ, but only
requir'd a general Consent of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
for the other pretended
part of it, which is drawn out in
Disputes. I found little encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to hope any advantage
or improvement by labouring in
such an interessed Labyrinth. For
when with as much power of
Impartial Reason as I was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with, I had steddily
weigh'd the particulars that were
so warmly disputed among <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
I could not convince my
self (though I had a charitable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to the contrary) but that
all the particulars from whence
such passionate Differences had
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103977:7"/>
sprung, were caus'd more by the
Zeal for this World than for the
other.</p>
            <p>For in the first place, there
was never any Point, now in
Controversie, that had a name
pretended when Tradition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan:
If they had a Birth it was
unknown, they lay asleep in their
Cradles, till the future noise of
the Church rouz'd them, but had
no growth at all; and after many
years continuing Infants, giving a
Testimony at least of an unlawful
Birth, being then disown'd by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Fathers they were then
laid to. So that the Disputes seem'd
of what Men invented, not what
they found; and in Civil Matters
'twould be thought a ridiculous
Contention about a Title of an
invented Thing, that never was
heard of in Five or six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
years, and then not to be
found.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:103977:8"/>
Whoever will take Pains to
sum up the Differences Disputed
among <hi>Christians,</hi> may easily find
the Dates and Commencements of
every one, long after the time
from whence they would derive
the Causes of them. And since the
particulars disputed are (for the
most part) affirmed to be of such
Consequence, it seems strange
that none of them should have
such a plain Name, as not capable
to be called otherwise, and after
a Deluge of so many hundred
years, when admir'd <hi>Tradition,</hi>
nor the least <hi>Ecclesiastical Gazett</hi>
had given notice of any such
thing, to see strange Births, and
new Names contended for.</p>
            <p>But that it may justly be
thought too prolix and improper
for my intended Subject, I
could set down most of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
their times of Birth, and
the Confident Fathers that first
own'd them, who, while they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103977:8"/>
were thus Passionate for their
own unquiet Off-springs, did for
ought they knew endeavour to
illegitimate the Truth. For large
Disputes, and Divisions of Mens
Minds, shew there is a Doubt,
which is the right <hi>Determination;</hi>
but one side finds a Protection
for themselves against all Error,
and Mistakes: For those who call
themselves an <hi>Infallible Church,</hi>
must consequently make their
<hi>Determination</hi> so; and not only
secure what is past, but what is
to be, by Declaring from the
same assumed Power, a right of
making new Articles of Faith.
So that none need Examine why
they believe at present, nor be
sollicitous for what they believe
hereafter.</p>
            <p>To add to this, I confess, I
could not upon my best Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
find that any of the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
controverted among <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
purely and abstractedly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103977:9"/>
considered in themselves, and the
Validity of their own Natures
could have any effectual Vertue
or use, by the Opinion of them,
in Point of Salvation, no more
than if they had never received
their injurious Beings by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of Disputing Parties; for
some of them are so unnecessary,
that the most earnest Contenders
for them want Modesty, so much
as to desire; that since we must
endeavour to Live as well as we
ought, that the certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of those things must needs
be useless to that end; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is not in it self materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
can be useful to the Means;
and if Faith, Charity, and Justice
must be the effectual means, I
cannot see how it is necessary to
consider of believing, or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
any Thing that is not in it
self purely necessary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for its own intrinsick Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:103977:9"/>
This being my Thoughts of the
<hi>Polemic</hi> part of Divinity, I could
not perceive any use for my self
or others, to be extracted out of
these interessed quarrels, and
therefore resolved not to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
farther in a Wilderness,
where all disputed the way, and
most pretended to be unerring
Guides. But were the Apostles
now Living, they would see a
greater improvement by these
Disputes, than would have been
purchas'd by their plainer Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
and Doctrines; of which
they wou'd be sufficiently evinc'd
by the (then unthought of)
Titles and large Possessions of
their Successors. But things of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Natures are most apt
to get respect, visible impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are made the most worthy
Objects of Faith: And the
Church the less visible, the more
Veneration to be given it; and
submitting imagination must
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103977:10"/>
make that greatest, that is not to
be made less by being possible to
be found out where it is.</p>
            <p>The next thing I Consider'd
was <hi>Philosophy,</hi> wherein I found
also Disputes warmly maintain'd,
Men being apt to engage for the
pride of Victory, or lust of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.
And it appears plainly,
that not the desire of Truth only
has engaged many in the search
of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> since the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
fate of it shews that the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
receiv'd Credit, as the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of Men were guided by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
or Opposition. For in Things
that admit no Demonstration,
there is more room for Disputes
than common Benefit.</p>
            <p>The beginning of it is reckon'd
from <hi>Thales</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who
made first the publick profession of
it. But the Account is given faintly
by <hi>Laertius;</hi> and what we read
of them and others down to the
time of <hi>Socrates,</hi> are but dark Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103977:10"/>
either to raise, use, or
dispute from. Under him <hi>Plato</hi>
began his Studies, and <hi>Aristotle</hi>
in his time appear'd in <hi>Athens.</hi>
The Differences between the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks</hi>
and <hi>Epicureans</hi> were famous,
and by their Disputes made way
for the Doctrine of <hi>Plato</hi> to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
which <hi>Cicero</hi> in his time fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
close, finding it perhaps
useful to Eloquence which he so
much Laboured in.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of <hi>Aristotle</hi> lay
silent, while <hi>Plato</hi>'s spread in <hi>Italy</hi>
and <hi>Greece,</hi> which were then the
only Countries of Learning. 'Tis
said that the Writings of <hi>Aristotle</hi>
lay hid about One hunder'd and
sixty years, and almost spoil'd by
the moisture of the Cave where
they were buried; after sold for a
great price to a wealthy Citizen of
<hi>Athens,</hi> who had a fancy for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a great Collection of Books
hard to be gotten. Afterwards
when <hi>Sylla</hi> took the City, he took
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103977:11"/>
these Writings with a design to
bring them to <hi>Rome:</hi> But he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they fell into the Hands of one
<hi>Tyrannion.</hi> After him <hi>Andronicus</hi>
got them into his Possession, who
seem'd the first restorer of them,
and made them known in <hi>Rome,</hi>
about the time of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Reputation.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Plato</hi> was yet famous in
all Places, and the <hi>Romans</hi> that
found Advantage and Preferments
depended more upon Eloquence
than Natural Philosophy, applied
themselves most to the Moral Part
of it, and from thence form'd <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Established the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Doctrine in <hi>Rome,</hi> till
the same Cause gave Reputation
to <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s. In <hi>Domitians</hi> time,
the Disputes of the Philosophers
began to be so troublesome to the
Government, that they were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<hi>Rome. Marcus Aurelius</hi>
brought it again in high Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103977:11"/>
and in his time the Doctrine
of <hi>Plato</hi> was in such Esteem, that
it grew in Fashion among the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and so continued to the time
of <hi>Severus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this first Age the Church
seem'd to have a Birth; the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Christian Religion
was thought to have the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
from Philosophers, whose
Disputes among themselves, and
the Division of their Sects, gave
<hi>Lucian</hi> one of the best occasions
to turn it into ridicule.</p>
            <p>Some of the Sages among the
Christians finding the Pagans so
averse to any that disown'd Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
they clos'd with them in
becoming <hi>Platonists,</hi> whose Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
was then so highly prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and then this Philosophy was
by them judged most agreeable to
the Christian Religion; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to turn <hi>Justin,</hi> who was
afterwards Martyr'd; who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow'd,
that the Philosophy of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103977:12"/>
               <hi>Plato</hi> dispos'd him to Christianity.
Many Bishops were also admirers
of that Philosophy; <hi>Origen</hi> and
St. <hi>Austin</hi> were great Asserters of
<hi>Plato</hi>'s Doctrine, and the useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it for Christianity; and
the two first Ages were absolute
Opposers of that of <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> was one of the first
that appeared against the Doctrine
of <hi>Plato;</hi> calling him the first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of all Heresies; and both
he, and <hi>Arnobius</hi> follow'd by St.
<hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who most sharply of
any handled that Doctrine. And
then the Stream quite turn'd; and
as in the First and Second Age it
was believed Christianity was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
by it; so now in the Third
and Fourth Ages 'twas found out
that Heresie sprung from it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers were not so
clear sighted to find out that the
Subtilties of <hi>Aristotle</hi> were not
full of a Spirit of Contradiction
against the Christian Religion;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103977:12"/>
but the <hi>Greeks</hi> that flourish'd in
the Eleventh Age, found it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by studying it; and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
of <hi>Avicen</hi> and <hi>Averrhoes</hi>
on the Philosophy of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
his Reputation, and helped
it to spread.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>13th.</hi> Age, as the <hi>French</hi>
write, the Works of <hi>Aristotle</hi>
were brought into <hi>France,</hi> and
for some time taught in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity;
but after a little time his
Writings were burnt, and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
threatned against any
that taught out of them: His <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicks</hi>
were Condemned by an
Assembly of Bishops at <hi>Paris;</hi>
and six years after the Cardinal
of <hi>Estieune,</hi> sent by Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi>
forbid the Professors of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of <hi>Paris</hi> to teach his <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks;</hi>
which afterwards was also
Condemned by a Bull of <hi>Gregory</hi>
the Ninth, and one <hi>Simon</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor,
and <hi>Diuant</hi> a Master of
Arts, were after accused of Heresie,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103977:13"/>
for being Esteemers of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s
Opinions and Writings. <hi>Mezeray</hi>
says, that in the Year 1209. one
<hi>Almeric</hi> a Priest, beginning to
preach some Novelties, had been
forc'd to recant; for which he
died of Grief. Several after his
Death follow'd his Opinion, and
were Condemn'd to be burnt;
and he being Excommunicated by
the Council of <hi>Paris,</hi> his Body
was taken up, and his Ashes
thrown upon a Dunghil. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they believed the Books of
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> lately brought from
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> had fill'd their
Heads with these Heretical Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties,
the same Council forbids
the reading or keeping them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pain of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But
during this Disgrace, there
arose in his defence three famous
Divines, to whom <hi>Damascen</hi> had
open'd the way, having abridg'd
many of his Works; which had
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103977:13"/>
assisted him to put in order his
great work of Divinity: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
others improv'd this,
and took as it were a Plan of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
from <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</p>
            <p>In
the year 1366. Two Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
Commissioners from <hi>Vrban</hi>
the Fifth, came to Establish the
Doctrine of <hi>Aristotle</hi> in <hi>France;</hi>
where it was order'd, that none
shou'd proceed Master of Arts,
that were not Examined upon his
<hi>Logick, Physicks, Metaphysicks,</hi>
and his Books of the <hi>Soul;</hi> and
afterwards were enjoyned to
study <hi>Aristotle</hi> carefully, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the Reputation of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity.</p>
            <p>Pope
<hi>Nicholas</hi> the Fifth, a
great advancer of Learning, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a new Translation of
<hi>Aristotle</hi> into <hi>Latin,</hi> for the use of
the Divines of the <hi>Romish</hi>
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:103977:14"/>
Pope <hi>John,</hi> that Canoniz'd St.
<hi>Thomas</hi> and his Doctrine, increas'd
the Reputation of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> from
whom that great Doctor had
drawn his Principles; but now
his Writings became the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Laws of Philosophy.</p>
            <p>In the Fourteenth Age grew
the hot Contention between the
<hi>Thomists</hi> and the <hi>Scotists:</hi> The
Disciples of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
about Subtile things, or (as
<hi>Mezeray</hi> calls them) brangling
Cobweb-Controversies, which
yet was pursued with Passion,
according to Interest or Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or by engagement of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
And so multiply'd were
Disputes, that a <hi>Venetian</hi> Writer
pretended to reckon up Twelve
thousand Volumes published in
that Age about the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of
<hi>Aristotle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This pursuit of Differences,
and Niceties, never to be made
decidable, grew to raise a new
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103977:14"/>
Philosophy, that the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
scarcely intelligible: Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
and the Excessive love of
Dispute, caused so many vain sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties,
that <hi>Philosophy</hi> began to
lose its former Credit and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
And if it were not from
my purpose, the naming only of
those useless and unintelligible Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties
would easily convince any,
that by the sharp Disputes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
it was for Truth, or the
hopes evidently to discover it,
that engaged the quarrelling
Parties.</p>
            <p>Yet after this the Reputation
of <hi>Aristotle</hi> so far increas'd, and
was so established in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of <hi>Paris,</hi> that <hi>Ramus,</hi> who had
found out some new Subtilties in
<hi>Logick,</hi> and Published some Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
upon <hi>Aristotle</hi> to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
his Credit, was by the other
Professors in the University con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
in the year 1543. for
Rash, Ignorant, and Impudent,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103977:15"/>
to dare write any thing against
<hi>Aristotle;</hi> and an Order made,
that none should teach any other
Philosophy. Such a Religious
Veneration they had for <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
that dissenting from it grew a
Heresie; and in the Massacre at
<hi>Paris, Ramus</hi> was murther'd with
as much fury, as the <hi>Calvinists</hi>
themselves.</p>
            <p>The Credit of <hi>Aristotle</hi> was
also not a little encreas'd in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of <hi>Bucer, Calvin, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon,</hi>
and others; and it was
then more and more found out,
that it was a support to the dark
Opinions of that Church. This
was the Cause that it was so sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by the Doctors of <hi>Paris</hi>
in the year 1611. by making a
new Rule, that all Professors
should teach the Philosophy of
<hi>Aristotle.</hi> And in the year 1624.
a Request was denied for some
particular <hi>Theses</hi> to be propos'd
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103977:15"/>
against the Doctrine of <hi>Aristotle</hi>
And the same Parliament in the
Year 1629. made an Arrest against
some <hi>Chymists,</hi> upon the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Sorbonists,</hi> that the
Principles of <hi>Aristotle</hi> cou'd not
be written against, or lessen'd,
without prejudicing the School-Divinity
receiv'd. And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
rais'd and confirm'd his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
in all Universities, which
were first encourag'd by the
Popes, as proper Soils to sow
the Seeds for Disputers to grow
up, to defend and support all
new and dark Opinions. Thus
his Name grew almost Sacred in
Universities; and <hi>Queens Colledge</hi>
in <hi>Oxford</hi> yet shews a kind
of Testimony of Veneration,
by reading <hi>Aristotle</hi> upon their
Knees; and those that take De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
sworn to defend his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:103977:16"/>
Whosoever will impartially
consider the dark Subtilties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Philosophy,
will find reason enough for the
use of it in as dark, but more
dull Writings of School-Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whose end seems only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
all things with obscure
and dark distinctions. For when
an impartial Obedience is to be
perswaded, the most sublime and
unintelligible means are most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to be used.</p>
            <p>And 'tis no wonder if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and Sages of the Three first
Ages, were not quick enough to
understand a sort of Dullness, of
which then they had no use, the
thing not being then found out
that they were to be applied to.
But when the occasion was ready
for it, the puzling parts of <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>'s
Philosophy were found use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
and among all his dark Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties,
none more convenient
than that of separated Essences
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103977:16"/>
which were Beings where no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was, and the only proper No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to find out a place for <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory;</hi>
and seem'd also very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to support the hard Point of
<hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> where there
appears a Substance, that must not
be believ'd to be there, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
to be believ'd there that is
not at all to be perceiv'd. Yet
though the Church engag'd in the
Quarrel, the Credit of the New
Philosophy has increas'd chiefly by
the Writings of <hi>Mirandula, Lod.
Vives, Galilaeus, Gassendus,</hi> and
<hi>Des Carles,</hi> and by many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Philosophers of our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I have not given this Account
with the least Design or Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to lessen the Esteem of
<hi>Knowledge</hi> in this particular of
<hi>Philosophy.</hi> For certainly the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Reason</hi> of things is worthy
of such a search as may inform.
But to labour in the endless and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103977:17"/>
useless searches of Subtilties and
nice Distinctions, can be for no
other use but Disputes, caus'd by
the Vanity of suppos'd Victory, or
the Application to Interest. At
least, I could not find a clear ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to my self, or cou'd have
hoped to have offer'd any others,
by endeavouring to obtain the
Perfections of an imperfect Study,
wherein nothing appear'd to me
promising any thing of publick
use or private demonstration.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> setting
aside that vain part of it, <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi>
I only know enough of it
to deplore I had not made my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Study there, where a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
made it more proper for
the true use of men, than for their
Designs. For in things that admit
the least Dispute, men must be least
divided; and yet <hi>Evident Truth</hi>
begets the least Interest, and the
fewest Admirers. But where
things not only above Reason,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103977:17"/>
but contrary to Sense, are impos'd
upon mens Belief, that implicite
Faith, and consequently Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
must be the sure Foundation
of Interest; and those who have
parted with their Wits, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
part with their Fortunes.
For certainly had not such extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Designs prosper'd on ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
men, the Ecclesiasticks had not
crept into such great Titles and
large Possessions, that the Apostles
cou'd hardly find any Image of
themselves in their Successors,
and as little in some of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
who never were taught, or
did teach, to deny <hi>Sense,</hi> and to
make <hi>visible Truth,</hi> or <hi>sensible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,</hi>
a Sin.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mathematicks</hi> have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
caus'd less Disputes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
fewer in the Study of it,
where Truth can only be the
Search and the Reward, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
must be confounded by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.
But the other Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103977:18"/>
are most suitable to the bent
Nature of Mankind, where things
not to be clearly decided, nourish
Contention and Design: For ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
People being ready for extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Notions, excuse the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of not examining, by the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of believing it safer to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
implicitly to others, than to
use their own Sense. And at last,
by such intire submissions, Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities
become as easie to them as
Truths, and Falseness as Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration;
like those that use them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
perpetually to hot Waters,
Spirit of Wine it self at last is
swallow'd up, without being
perceiv'd to have any violent
strength.</p>

            <p>THE next Study to
this, that seem'd near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Truth, and of most
use, was <hi>History,</hi> in
which the best mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of men are to be found;
and the <hi>Comparisons</hi> of Calms and
Storms in Empires, the Quiet and
Revolutions under several Princes
and Governours, will best teach
by what Methods Kingdoms have
been preserv'd and shaken; which
is not only useful for those that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
but those that obey, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the first how to preserve,
and the last how to afford the
Means.</p>
            <p>Nor did any thing appear more
agreeable to me, than the use that
<hi>Machiavel</hi> makes of <hi>History</hi> in his
<hi>Decads</hi> on <hi>Livy,</hi> where his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourses,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103977:19"/>
grounded upon Reason,
have yet matter of Fact to support
them, and brings it the nearest to
a Demonstration. For Notions in
<hi>Politicks,</hi> unsupported with Fact,
seem only bare Opinions; but
from those Accidents and Events
that we have seen follow closely
the Wisdom and Vertue of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or the Folly and Vices of
them and their Favourites and
Ministers, (sharing so much their
Power) may be reasonably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
that Judgment of things
which must be useful to practice, or
avoid, by the ruling and obeying
part.</p>
            <p>There are no Prescriptions (in
my Opinion at least) so useful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this Sickness, as the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in <hi>History;</hi> to see what
Glory and Safety wise and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Princes have obtain'd, and
what Ruine the Cruelty and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of others have brought upon
themselves and Subjects. In eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103977:19"/>
Country their own Precedents
are most proper for themselves,
since living under the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
they may justly expect
the same Effects from those happy
or unfortunate Causes.</p>
            <p>In all our Stories, I look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
none so instructing as this part
I have chosen, where the power
of firm Vertue and unsteady Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
so evidently appear'd in their
close Operations.</p>
            <p>I do not look upon a calm and
quiet Reign so much the Proof of
steady Vertue, where Peace has
descended with the Empire, nor
the Troubles of an unquiet time
so clear an Evidence of unsteady
Errors, where the Storms and
Troubles descended with the
Crown. But when in an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
and repeated Succession, the
Extreams alternately have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
and destroy'd. I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these as the clear Testimonies
of the different Powers of Vice
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103977:20"/>
and Vertue, Steddiness and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directness,
Justice, and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>The
Examples are no where to
be found more close than in the
Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second and
<hi>Richard</hi> the Second. The first
succeeded his Father <hi>Edward,</hi>
who came to the Crown after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Troubles that his Father <hi>Henry</hi>
the Third had long labour'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
but his steddy Vertue over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
all Troubles at home, and
conquer'd his Enemies abroad;
and was the first that made <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
look like a Powerful and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish'd
Monarchy. His unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Son <hi>Edward</hi> unravell'd
what he had wound up, and by
unsteddy Errors shook that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
that descended so unshaken to
him from his mighty Father. His
Son <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and Methods of his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
restor'd what his Father had
lost. <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103977:20"/>
Son of the <hi>Black Prince,</hi> succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Grandfather in his Throne;
but his Great Grandfather, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Second, in the same fatal
and unsteddy measures, lost more
than the other had gained. For
though he lost his Life, like <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Second, yet he lost more
than he; for with him the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
ended, and fell into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Line.</p>
            <p>No Subject appear'd to me so
worthy of Remarks as this; which
evidently shews, that there is a
general Temper in Mankind, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to their own Peace, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and firm Minds wou'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
Fortune and occasion add
to, or diminish the Temper of
most, who sink either too low,
or swell too high: Success makes
them salse to themselves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
All modest and profess'd
Principles are lost in such a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
and both Kings and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
have harass'd one another by
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103977:21"/>
such alterations, and shook the
Government they both seem'd ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of.</p>
            <p>Sometimes when Kings have
been in such a Condition that is
capable to ground sufficient Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
upon, there never want those
either indigent in Fortune or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
to perswade Kings, That Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
Power (for so they call
Laws observ'd) is but the Fetters
of a Prince, and they need be
worn no longer than he submits
to publick Notions, which are
nothing but unsolid Fancies: For
if a King does not assume all
Power, the Subjects will grow
into the greatest share, and will
necessitate him to try for all, or
have as good as none.</p>
            <p>On the other side, a Prince at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
this, and failing, he sinks
perhaps to grant as much as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to get, and believes to find
a stop in their Desires, who knew
none in his own. Subjects are
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103977:21"/>
at first modest, and their Desires
are grounded upon Common Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
but usually when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their Credit and Condition
large enough for a Foundation,
they increase as fast in Desires as
Fortune gives them occasion; and
when they gain more than they
expected, they will ask more to
secure what they had obtain'd,
and at last make themselves inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to trust or be trusted. It is
the Nature of Extremities to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
no retreat; and the mischiefs
of either side are equal to the
<hi>Common Peace;</hi> and wherever a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish'd
Power rests, the <hi>Tyranny</hi> is
alike.</p>
            <p>Nothing more illustrates this
than the unfortunate Reigns of
those Two unhappy Princes <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Second, and <hi>Richard</hi> the
Second, both Princes of resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Tempers, not affected with
<hi>extraordinary Cruelty</hi> in their own
Natures, of competent <hi>Sense</hi> and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103977:22"/>
               <hi>Courage,</hi> but ill Users of both:
In <hi>Prosperity</hi> they seem'd to shew
more Courage than they had, and
in <hi>Adversity</hi> less; by which it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
appear'd they were more
influenced by others than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
who <hi>flatter'd</hi> them in a
<hi>good Condition,</hi> and <hi>forsook</hi> them
in a <hi>bad.</hi> They were both apt to
be fond of <hi>Favourites,</hi> and the
Nobility as apt to hate them:
Yet some of those that condemn'd
those Kings for fixing too much
their <hi>Favours</hi> upon particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
wou'd perhaps have been as
pleas'd to enjoy the same good
Fortune. But the publick was
made complain for their private
Displeasures, and the usual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
use of Power in those
<hi>Favourites,</hi> caus'd such a Distance
in the Hearts of King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that the attempting the <hi>Cure</hi>
of the <hi>Diseases</hi> that sprung from
the infection of ambitious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
procur'd <hi>Calamities</hi> in their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103977:22"/>
               <hi>Redress;</hi> as <hi>Physicians,</hi> sometimes
one <hi>Disease</hi> as a Remedy for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to cure a <hi>Lethargy,</hi> the
Patient must be driven to a <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King
<hi>Edward</hi> gave this Offence
by his unlimited <hi>Favours</hi> to <hi>Gave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi>
and after him to the <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers:</hi>
King <hi>Richard</hi> to the Duke
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Suffolk.
Gaveston</hi>'s Person was very charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and his Mind and Frame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
fitted for <hi>Luxuries,</hi> which
was discern'd by that great Prince
<hi>Edward</hi> the First, who banish'd
him, and on his Death-bed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
his Son never to bring him
back. He was a man of <hi>Courage,</hi>
but when rais'd to Power, he
grew from all Evenness of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and was as insolent as his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
was great.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spencers</hi> succeeded him in
<hi>Favour,</hi> in whom no particular
marks of good Qualities cou'd be
trac'd; never satisfied with <hi>wealth,</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:103977:23"/>
nor ever satisfied with <hi>revenge.</hi>
The Riches of the Nation seem'd
but enough to satisfie their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions,
and the Destruction of it
to secure their Safeties. They
first justly made many their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and then destroy'd them for
being so. By this it may seem
strange, that Princes shou'd have
that Excess of Value for such
worthless Objects, which more
ordinary persons wou'd hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
upon them. But those of
the loosest and most debauched
Principles are aptest to feed the
Humour of men, who love to be
nourish'd by soft <hi>Flatteries;</hi> and
Common People are not Objects
for such Endeavours. Princes
tempt the Tempters, who creep
into their Power by perpetual
whispers, how to enlarge theirs,
and twisting themselves into their
Princes Favour and Opinion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
his <hi>Interest</hi> with theirs, and
render any <hi>Displeasure</hi> against
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103977:23"/>
them, the want of <hi>Duty</hi> to
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> the Second was as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
as his Choice of <hi>Favourites.</hi>
The first was the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
better than the rest, but hardly
better than any others. He was
not a great studier of <hi>mischief,</hi> but
a ready <hi>Adviser</hi> to pursue any <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi>
to enlarge Power. He
seem'd to want Courage to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
and few want Courage to
embrace. So that it was possible
he might have rested in a limited
share of <hi>Fortune,</hi> and been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with a <hi>moderate quietness,</hi>
had he not been joyned with the
<hi>turbulent</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who, in
all <hi>Conditions,</hi> merited the worst
<hi>Character;</hi> in War, fearful; in
Peace, insupportable; all <hi>Vertue</hi>
unthought of by him, and <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief</hi>
his study, and his Diseas'd
Mind the common place of <hi>Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:103977:24"/>
               <hi>Tresilian,</hi> the <hi>Chief Justice,</hi> was
an useful Minister to assist such a
<hi>Favourite,</hi> who was ready to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<hi>Law</hi> to <hi>Occasion,</hi> and make
the <hi>Occasion</hi> suitable to <hi>Law;</hi> and
'tis probable he got his Place by
such measures; for his <hi>Reason</hi>
was <hi>Violence,</hi> and his <hi>Justice Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There
was nothing right or
wrong, but what he was directed
to determine so, and gave a full
Testimony of himself in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding
the <hi>Ten Queries</hi> propos'd by
the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> all which were
resolved into <hi>Treason,</hi> or to merit
<hi>Death.</hi> By which Resolves the
Nation was made the <hi>Traitor,</hi> and
the <hi>Treason</hi> fitted certainly to find
out <hi>Traitors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus commonly Men attain to
Princes Favours, by being more
Councellors to their Humors than
their Interest, and with unconfin'd
Flattery betray them to the
Temptation of unlimited Power.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103977:24"/>
And this violent driving all
things into Extreams, was the fall
of those too unhappy Princes,
who, when they had Power
shew'd no Moderation, and when
they wanted it, betray'd as much
Dejection.</p>
            <p>This shook that Trust, which
is the Foundation of peace, and
that once shaken, either side (as
occasion offer'd) acted the same
immoderation, which they before
Condemn'd. Both these Princes in
the change of Fortune, denied
and granted too much, and most
commonly denied what they had
granted, and granted what they
had denied before, by which they
disoblig'd in denying, and their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
seem'd no Obligation when
bestow'd. The first was look'd
upon, as design'd to injure their
Subjects, and the last as a fear of
them.</p>
            <p>These things will be best illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
by giving an impartial Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103977:25"/>
of some resembling Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
in the Actions of these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Princes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> the Second began first
with his receiving the banished
<hi>Gaveston</hi> into Favour before his
Fathers Funerals were performed,
makes him Earl of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and
gives him the Lordship of <hi>Man;</hi>
and in his first Actions, seems to
forget his Fathers Commands, and
neglect the Advice of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.</p>
            <p>This
so enrag'd the Nobility,
that they press for <hi>Gaveston</hi>'s Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
or threaten'd (if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd)
to hinder his Coronation.
The King (pursued always with a
Fatal unsteadiness) yields to their
Demands, and Promises in the
next Parliament all they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired:
Yet after he had promis'd
the Banishment of <hi>Gaveston,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
him, notwithstanding, to
carry St. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Crown. This
aggravates so much, that the next
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103977:25"/>
               <hi>Parliament</hi> proceeded much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
Thus the <hi>Ballances</hi> began to be
tost up and down, as any weight
on either side, helpt to hoist up the
other.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Parliament</hi> they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
their <hi>advantage;</hi> and the
King not only grants them power
to draw <hi>Articles,</hi> but takes his
<hi>Oath</hi> to <hi>confirm</hi> whatever they
<hi>concluded;</hi> and he that before
seem'd jealous of trusting his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>
now gave them an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of revenging that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust.</p>
            <p>The
want of <hi>Confidence</hi> before
seem'd to betray an ill <hi>Intention,</hi>
and this unlimited <hi>Confidence</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
the Opinion of it; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
what he design'd both
shou'd conceal; and by the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams,</hi>
taught the fatal <hi>Lesson</hi> of
<hi>Jealousie;</hi> and those perhaps that
advis'd the ill Designs, wanting
power to bring them forth from
their own Fears, gave Councils
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103977:26"/>
contrary to their former <hi>Advices</hi> in
a better <hi>Condition:</hi> For men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Principles are guided by those
Opinions that unequal Fears, or
unsteddy Ambition gives them,
and receive no Council from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>Principles,</hi> or unshaken <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Mistakes provok'd the
Banishment of <hi>Gaveston,</hi> and the
King became liable to <hi>Perjury</hi>
whenever they pleased. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had committed this Error,
he pursues it with a greater; and
though he banish'd <hi>Gaveston</hi> to
keep his Oath, he violates again
by re-calling him, and gives him
his <hi>Neece</hi> in <hi>Marriage,</hi> and so
much <hi>Rules,</hi> that it justly merited
the Censure of wasting the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Treasure.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Barrons</hi> enrag'd at this
<hi>Breach</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>King,</hi> and
to see the <hi>Fortune</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi>
thrown into a <hi>Stranger</hi>'s Hands,
threaten Force against their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103977:26"/>
Prince,</hi> and by this means
obtain again the Banishment of
<hi>Gaveston,</hi> with a Clause of <hi>Death,</hi>
if ever he returned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gaveston</hi> having not been long
in <hi>Banishment,</hi> and finding, or at
least believing he was not safe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
thought it less hazardous
to trust to the former extravagant
<hi>Affection</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> than <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
and <hi>Strangers</hi> in another
Countrey; and upon this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
comes back into <hi>England,</hi>
and immediately repairs to him.
The King (according to his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation)
receiv'd him with such an
<hi>Excess</hi> of <hi>inconsiderate Joy</hi> and
<hi>Kindness,</hi> that it seem'd as if <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veston</hi>
brought always <hi>Charms</hi> more
powerful than any <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Obligation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this the <hi>Lords</hi> again took
Arms, and petition in the Name
of the whole <hi>Commonalty,</hi> That
<hi>Gaveston</hi> may be banish'd. The
<hi>King</hi> more fond of <hi>Gaveston,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:103977:27"/>
than sensible of what he had done,
or of their <hi>Force</hi> or <hi>Petition,</hi> takes,
as it were, a <hi>Flight</hi> with him, and
puts him with <hi>Forces</hi> into <hi>Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough-Castle;</hi>
and as <hi>Gaveston</hi> seem'd
to aim at security, by weaving the
<hi>King's Fortunes</hi> with <hi>his,</hi> so the
<hi>King</hi> seem'd to make his <hi>Fortunes</hi>
as desperate as <hi>Gaveston</hi>'s, by sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his <hi>Condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Lords</hi> eagerly pursu'd him
to <hi>Scarborough,</hi> which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieg'd
and took, together with
<hi>Gaveston,</hi> whom they immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beheaded. Thus this <hi>unhappy</hi>
Prince neglecting his own <hi>Faith,</hi>
gave others the Opinion, that
theirs was discharg'd; and the <hi>fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of a <hi>Favourite</hi> above the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
lessen'd their <hi>Duty,</hi> as he les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen'd
his <hi>Consideration</hi> of them: and
'tis too visible a truth, that a <hi>Prince</hi>
who so much resigns himself to <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,</hi>
must also resign his <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi>
to theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:103977:27"/>
The <hi>Lords,</hi> swell'd with this
Success (the usual Effects of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish't
Power), march with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
towards <hi>London,</hi> where the
<hi>King</hi> then was, where <hi>Necessity,</hi>
and not <hi>Choice,</hi> seem'd to be the
means that a <hi>Parliament</hi> was call'd,
where the <hi>King</hi> complain'd of the
<hi>Barons,</hi> who justified their unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Actions, by the <hi>Errors</hi> of their
Prince, and plead Merit for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
purchas'd the <hi>Banishment</hi> of
<hi>Strangers</hi> to quiet the People.
Thus <hi>unsteddy Actions</hi> beget <hi>wild
Arguments,</hi> and <hi>false Pretensions</hi>
are too much supported by
<hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, a <hi>Composure</hi> for the
present was made by the <hi>Queen,</hi>
the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
who calm'd the <hi>Barons</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Temper of asking the <hi>King</hi>'s
Pardon; and several <hi>Articles</hi> were
agreed on for present satisfaction,
which seem'd as if the <hi>Lords</hi> had
more Inclinations to <hi>Obedience</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:103977:28"/>
than <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and wanted but
the prudent <hi>Justice</hi> of a Prince
to be applied, to cure these
<hi>Wounds</hi> that <hi>Jealous Discontents</hi>
had made.</p>
            <p>But the Mischief of former ill
<hi>Humours</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> remain'd,
and began to shew themselves by
the dealy of performing what was
agreed on, which was the Cause
that the Earls of <hi>Arundel, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and <hi>Warren,</hi> refus'd to
go with the <hi>King</hi> against the
<hi>Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seems strange, that <hi>Vnsted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness</hi>
and <hi>Injustice,</hi> Two of the
<hi>weakest Errors</hi> of Mankind, shou'd
become <hi>Rules</hi> for <hi>Princes</hi> to act
by, which could hardly be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
were they not resign'd to the
<hi>Councils</hi> of others, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to their Interests, such
who cannot by <hi>National Methods</hi>
pursue their <hi>Ambitious Designs,</hi>
and protect what they obtain;
the pursuit of Honour and Riches
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103977:28"/>
are seldom limited, and putting
a Distance between <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>People</hi> is the only means to keep
them remote from <hi>Examination</hi>
and <hi>Justice,</hi> and at least involve
their Interest so with his, that to
question <hi>them</hi> is to attack his <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To
foment <hi>Differences</hi> between
the <hi>King</hi> and others, was now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by little <hi>Artifices;</hi> one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of which was the taking
away the Earl of <hi>Lancaster</hi>'s Wife
by one <hi>Richard</hi> St. <hi>Martin,</hi> claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her as his, and that he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
lain with her; and claim'd
by her the Two Earldoms of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi>
and <hi>Salisbury.</hi> This was an
<hi>Action</hi> that seem'd to shew the
Encouragement and Assistance of
great Power; nor did they that
contriv'd it, omit their chief aim
of having the <hi>King</hi> thought a
Party, at once to engage him in
their <hi>Designs</hi> and <hi>Animosities,</hi> and
to revenge himself and them by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103977:29"/>
particular Injuries: For 'tis not
to be presum'd, that such a man
as the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> could
have such a violence committed
in his House by an inconsiderable
Fellow, without great assistance
of Force and Power: and the
Two <hi>Earldoms</hi> (that seems rested
in her) were Arguments that the
Design was to affront the Duke
of <hi>Lancaster</hi> in the Diminution
of his Honour, and to make an
irreconcilable Difference between
the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>him,</hi> who being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to the <hi>King,</hi> and a man of
great <hi>Quality</hi> and <hi>Interest;</hi> might
perhaps be an Obstacle to those
Designs which were contriving by
the new <hi>Favourites;</hi> and it was
an improper consideration for such
to consider whether the <hi>King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi>
and <hi>Honour</hi> were best ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by this, but only whether
their own Designs were not best
pursu'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:103977:29"/>
And now the same Fatal <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>
began to shew it self; and
<hi>Hugh Spencer</hi> the Younger (who
<hi>Mezeray</hi> says had been bred up
with him in an unbecoming Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity,
and had absolute Empire
over him), succeeded <hi>Caveston</hi>
in an almost unlimited Favour and
Power. The first Difference that
this caused appeared at the Siege
of <hi>Berwick,</hi> which being near ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the <hi>Scots,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to make his Design to make
the Younger <hi>Spencer</hi> Governour
of it; upon which the Earl of
<hi>Lancaster</hi> withdrew his Forces,
with whom the <hi>Lords</hi> presently
took Arms, and declared the
Cause to be for the removing the
<hi>Spencers;</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> being now
got into joynt Commission of
Favour with his <hi>Son,</hi> who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
with as much Insolence
and Absoluteness as ever <hi>Gaveston</hi>
had done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:103977:30"/>
With these Forces they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
towards the <hi>King,</hi> and
boldly demand the Banishment
of the <hi>Spencers:</hi> The <hi>King</hi> not
being strong enough at present to
oppose them, gives a Temperate
Answer, only seeming averse to
punish any but by <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Law;</hi>
and therefore wou'd not banish
them unheard, but promises them
they shou'd answer to any Charge,
and swore he wou'd never par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
Offences prov'd. This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
did not yet satisfie the <hi>Lords,</hi>
who continued their March to
<hi>London,</hi> where the <hi>King</hi> grants all
things denied before.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King,</hi> that had yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to what was demanded by
<hi>Force,</hi> out of the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of that Power, retain'd
yet his former Inclinations, and
was so used to act by indirectness,
that he rather proceeded by
a familiar Method, than any
new Necessity, and praetis'd
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103977:30"/>
as much from Nature as Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>The
<hi>Spencers,</hi> by an <hi>Edict</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> by the
Earl of <hi>Hereford,</hi> were banished
the Realm; but in a very little
time, when the <hi>Lords</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
home, the <hi>Edict</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
in a Council held in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
where the Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> declared the Banishment
of the <hi>Spencers</hi> to have been Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.</p>
            <p>As
soon as the <hi>Lords</hi> were reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to their promised Quiet, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obtained what they desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the <hi>King</hi> began to design to
revenge on them the Displeasure
for what he himself had granted,
as if all his <hi>Favours</hi> were his <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi>
and his <hi>Severity</hi> his <hi>prudent
Justice.</hi> Thus while they thought
themselves restored to <hi>Peace,</hi> the
<hi>King</hi> prepares for <hi>War,</hi> and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
raising Forces, pursues the
<hi>Barons,</hi> many of whom revolt to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103977:31"/>
him; the rest make such prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as was possible in so short a
time, and stayed with their <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
at <hi>Burton upon Tnent:</hi> When
the <hi>King</hi>'s Army advanc'd to
them, they perceiv'd they were
much exceeded in Numbers; so
that the Earl of <hi>Lancaster</hi> thought
it wiser to retreat, especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,
that he had sent Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Holland</hi> to raise more Forces
among his Tenants, which Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
he thought it prudent to
wait for: But the Endeavour to
retreat, gave the <hi>King</hi>'s Forces
an Addition of Courage from that
Testimony of their Fear, which
was made use of by <hi>Valence</hi> Earl
of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> who then Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the <hi>King</hi>'s Army, who,
after some resistance, put them to
flight; after which the Earl of
<hi>Lancaster,</hi> and many Noblemen
and Gentlemen, were taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners.
The News of this Defeat,
or his own Falseness, brought Sir
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103977:31"/>
               <hi>Robert Holland,</hi> with his new rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Forces, to joyn with the
<hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As soon as these mighty Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were in the <hi>King</hi>'s Power,
the <hi>Spencers</hi> (full of Revenge)
urged on for the Execution of
all. 'Tis said, That <hi>Valence</hi> the
Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> who obtained
the Victory, interceded for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
but this rather hastens their
Fate; for <hi>Spencer</hi> was so appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive,
that the <hi>King</hi>'s Mercy to
any wou'd be a Cruelty to him,
that he successfully urg'd a quick
Execution: The <hi>King,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Lords,</hi> among whom was
<hi>Hugh Spencer,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
sat and gave Judgment
upon the Earl of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> who
was presently beheaded, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other <hi>Lords</hi> in their several
Countries, to disperse Terror in
every place. Above Twenty
Men of <hi>Quality</hi> were put to death
at this time; the first Blood of this
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103977:32"/>
nature that was ever shed since the
Conquest.</p>
            <p>Besides, the Earl of <hi>Lancaster,</hi>
there died Fourteen <hi>Lords</hi> and
<hi>Barons,</hi> their Estates and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances
were likewise seiz'd, and
were us'd to advance a new sort
of men, who must needs applaud
and flatter such Councils and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
that had been so favourable
to them; and questionless the
Streams of <hi>Flatteries</hi> flow'd to the
King, for his Choice of such a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
as <hi>Spencer,</hi> who had now
enthron'd him once again, and
by so much Blood procured him
the surest Coronation: Nor was
<hi>Spencer</hi> less blind in the Judgment
of his own Condition, who was
now <hi>Master</hi> of his <hi>King,</hi> and of
all those Spoils that this bloody
Success had thrown into his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Arms: But his Condition
was too prosperous temperately
to consider the <hi>Vncertainty</hi> of a
<hi>Violent Prosperity,</hi> watched by the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103977:32"/>
unwearied searches of Envy and
Revenge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
as commonly after such
Success; <hi>Law</hi> lay contemn'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Power,</hi> and the <hi>Interest</hi> of the
<hi>Nation</hi> under <hi>Conquest;</hi> all Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
and Composing Actions
formerly used, were now reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on as a <hi>Prince</hi>'s Shame, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing less than <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi>
his Dishonour; an ill chosen
Ground of Safety in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but most improper to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
a <hi>Prince</hi> in, who by the
weakness of <hi>unsteddy Judgment,</hi>
and the ill use of <hi>Power,</hi> had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently,
by mistrust, prepar'd
mens minds not to be couzen'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Flattery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It must be the Concurrence of
many strange Accidents, and the
close Reserve of a <hi>Prince</hi>'s Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that must steal him into <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Power;</hi> otherwise we had
heard of many more success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103977:33"/>
Tyrants in the World: For I
doubt not but generally the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
of Men have been more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to embrace more Power than
their <hi>Abilities</hi> or <hi>Accidents</hi> have
complied to assist them in: And
we seldom read of such as become
<hi>Slaves,</hi> but of such as have been
well <hi>couzen'd Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi>'s Power now seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
grown to a great height,
by the Numbers that his Success
encreas'd, flatter'd him as well as
their Tongues, that nothing was
able to resist him, and perhaps to
find uses for those Forces, that
now must be kept together, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
to march from <hi>York</hi> into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> rather with a mighty
<hi>Number</hi> than a <hi>powerful Army,</hi>
never considering, that such <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
without suitable <hi>Discipline</hi>
and <hi>Provisions,</hi> were a weakness
to themselves: The <hi>Scots,</hi> it
seem'd, consider'd this, and kept
close, and hindred them of all
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103977:33"/>
Provisions, leaving them to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
themselves; for <hi>Want</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing,
they were beaten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Blows,</hi> and return'd pursued
by <hi>Want</hi> and <hi>Dishonour,</hi> as well
as by the <hi>Scots,</hi> who enter'd far
into <hi>England,</hi> and return'd with
great Spoils into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This unhappy <hi>King,</hi> not made
for <hi>Councils,</hi> was as well not born
for Triumph, and was now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
at a calmer leisure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what he had done. It
seem'd something like regretting
Thoughts, when being earnestly
sollicited to pardon one of the
Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi>'s Followers, a
Man of a mean Condition, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
with Passion against such
Councellors that prest him to
spare the <hi>Life</hi> of such a <hi>Fellow,</hi>
and spoke not one word to spare
the <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Duke,</hi> though his
near Kinsman, whose Blood had
so near Relation to his own, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this true Reflection, that his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103977:34"/>
Life might have been useful to him,
the other's could not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Misfortune</hi> seem'd at this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
to give the <hi>King</hi> a more
temperate Consideration, which
in the streams of Success he would
hardly have leisure to entertain,
but this was rather an unsteddy
than a firm return to better and
more prudent Thoughts and
Councils, his Nature was still
the same, which made his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi>
or <hi>Displeasure</hi> equally dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
            <p>Sir
<hi>Andrew Hackley,</hi> who took
the Earl of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> shew'd the
Truth of this; for growing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to give apprehension to
the <hi>Spencers,</hi> he lost his new en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
<hi>Honours,</hi> together with his
<hi>Life,</hi> being first <hi>degraded</hi> of
them, and then <hi>executed:</hi> So
that the <hi>King</hi> seem'd at one
time ready to destroy, and to
revenge Destruction, just as the
Displeasure and Spleen of his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103977:34"/>
Ambitious Favourites guided
him.</p>
            <p>It was no wonder if so easie a
Conquest over a <hi>King</hi> shou'd
swell the <hi>Conquerour</hi> enough to
burst him; nor that so much
Wealth and Glory shou'd so
much dazzle the Eyes of <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi>
as to make him loose his
way; but all seem'd calm, nor
any little speck so like a Cloud
that seem'd to threaten any
storm; and the instability of this
World in <hi>general</hi> is seldom the
Contemplation of the <hi>Fortunate</hi>
and <hi>Ambitious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This made him attempt that
which was the highest Testimony
of his believ'd Security, in les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening
the <hi>Queens</hi> Attandance and
Maintenance: The <hi>Spencers</hi> were
not satiated with all the late
Spoils of the <hi>King</hi>'s Enemies,
nor with the Sale of his Favours
to his Friends; <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi>
were purchas'd as in a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103977:35"/>
common Market, and every thing
enclos'd or expos'd as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
Yet it seem'd all this was
not enough, or certainly they
wou'd not have endeavoured to
supply the want by the <hi>Queens</hi>
Prejudice, and raise the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
storm to disturb their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
Course: For the <hi>Queen</hi>
had been always the great support
of the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Composer</hi> of
his difficult Affairs: She repair'd
those Breaches the Errors of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
had made; one that still la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
for Peace, and was success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in it.</p>
            <p>It might seem strange, that <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites</hi>
could find ways to waste
as much as would support and
supply the Publick, and then seek
ways as extravagant to get it:
and yet more strange, that a <hi>King</hi>
shou'd be a Party in the dangerous
ways that led to his own Ruine,
and careful to preserve them by
the Hazard of himself. When
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103977:35"/>
               <hi>Gaveston</hi> and the <hi>Spencers</hi> seem'd
forsaken by God and Man, they
were never by their unfortunate
<hi>Prince,</hi> but by him the whole was
judged more guilty, and less wise
than his <hi>Favourites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fatal stream of Fortune,
the Prosperous and Ambitious
think of nothing but <hi>Enjoyments,</hi>
detest a <hi>sober,</hi> much more a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy</hi>
Consideration of those
strange and sudden <hi>Alterations</hi>
and <hi>Changes</hi> that this World is
subject to; but think their <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Prosperity</hi> has chain'd up
<hi>Accidents;</hi> and that <hi>Fortune,</hi> who
had flatter'd them as much as they
had done their <hi>Prince,</hi> wou'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be as obedient as she had
been seemingly fond of them:
<hi>Affliction</hi> gives <hi>Thoughts</hi> admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
but the swell'd Minds of the
successfully <hi>Ambitious</hi> seldom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to think.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:103977:36"/>
The First Accident that shew'd
this Truth, was the Troubles that
rose in <hi>France,</hi> which grew so
high that all the <hi>Kings Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories</hi>
were adjudged forfeited,
and many places of importance
seized: The storm was so violent
that there was no hopes of <hi>becalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
this <hi>Roughness,</hi> but by the
<hi>King</hi>'s going in Person to pay his
Homage, or at least the <hi>Queen</hi> to
mediate with her <hi>Brother.</hi> But
the <hi>Spencers</hi> thought it unsafe to
be separated from the <hi>King,</hi> who
yet was the only Fence against that
Sea of Discontent, whose Tide
every day appear'd to swell; and
they that had destroyed all <hi>Trust,</hi>
had reason enough to be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
            <p>Such
men so constantly guided
by pleasing Weaknesses, might not
perhaps descern the <hi>Queen</hi> might be
a <hi>dangerous Instrument</hi> to employ,
that had been so disobliged; but
commonly those that do injuries,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103977:36"/>
are the least apprehensive that they
will be remembred, or commonly
having no fear of those they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
they never consider the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
possibility of <hi>Revenge.</hi> But if
they had apprehended danger to
themselves in the <hi>Queens</hi> going,
yet they chose the less Evil, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
appearing so terrible as part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Queen</hi> was sent away
with an indifferent <hi>Train,</hi> and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
seemingly so well, that she
brought things to a fair accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
but upon such Terms as
did necessitate the <hi>Prince</hi> her Son
to be sent over to her. With him
she had what she desired, a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
to build her Revenge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which had been long rak'd
up in warm Embers, which now
she began to discover. And the
beginning of this <hi>Fire</hi> breaking
out, was made known to the <hi>King</hi>
by the Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> who se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
withdrew into <hi>England;</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:103977:37"/>
but she was stayed by the most
powerful Causes, <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</hi>
For she that now seem'd
free from all Ties to her <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>Husband,</hi> placed her loose Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> who
had lately escaped out of the <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
and from the Oppression of
the <hi>Spencers:</hi> She knew <hi>England</hi>
con'd neither be safe to her, nor
<hi>Mortimer,</hi> whom she valued as her
self; and therefore resolved to
trust any thing rather than her <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi>
or the <hi>Spencers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> thus delaying her
Obedience to the <hi>King,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to <hi>England, She</hi> and the
<hi>Prince</hi> were declared <hi>Enemies</hi> to
the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and they and their
Adherents banished; and at the
same time the <hi>Queen</hi> received In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
that there were great
Sums offered to have the <hi>Prince</hi>
murthered; upon which she with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
to the Earl of <hi>Haynault,</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:103977:37"/>
where she contracted her Son to
<hi>Philippa,</hi> Daughter to the <hi>Earl,</hi>
and there procures some <hi>Forces</hi>
and <hi>Moneys:</hi> Though her <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
were inconsiderable, yet she
reasonably depended upon what
she shou'd find in <hi>England,</hi> not
what she brought; For she knew
that any thing would be welcome
that brought a shew of redeeming
them from the Oppressions they
suffer'd under. With these there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she ventur'd to Sea, and after
some Variety of Accidents, she
landed with her Forces near <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
where immediately she found
all her Conjectures true: For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> repaired to
her; among them, the Two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Lincoln;</hi>
the first not forgetting the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Wrong, and both zealously
remembring the Injury the <hi>Clergy</hi>
had received.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:103977:38"/>
The <hi>Queen</hi> wanted not a just
Complaint to support her unjust
<hi>Cause;</hi> and so great were the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
that they hurried on
almost the whole <hi>Nation</hi> to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
a <hi>Double Rebellion</hi> in a <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
against her <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;</hi>
and the <hi>Pulpit</hi> was ready to
speak as execrably as others to act.
The Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi> taking for
his Text, <hi>My head aketh,</hi> raising
his revengeful and impious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
upon it; That a sick Head
was to be taken off; and in the
Revolutions that attended this
unhappy <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> the
Second, the <hi>Clergy</hi> were always
ready to Sanctifie, and the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi>
to make Rebellion Legal.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> had now the Clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
effects of ill <hi>Councels</hi> calling
too loud upon him, yet saw no
way left to recover or repair the
<hi>Misfortune</hi> those <hi>Errors</hi> had
brought him into. Wherever he
went he found no Subjects, those
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103977:38"/>
with their Hearts were lost before,
but led by as uncertain Councels
as his <hi>Life</hi> was Govern'd. He knew
not whether to fly, but only fled:
He saw <hi>London</hi> was unsafe, who
were all turn'd from <hi>Duty</hi> to him,
in <hi>Affection</hi> to the <hi>Queen:</hi> Nor
cou'd he propose any place to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
where he had not reason to
expect certain <hi>Enemies,</hi> or worse,
uncertain <hi>Friends.</hi> After many
Motions, as various as his former
Humors, he design'd for the <hi>Isle</hi>
of <hi>Lundy,</hi> and takes with him the
Earl of <hi>Glocester,</hi> the <hi>Spencers</hi> and
<hi>Robert Baldock,</hi> that was <hi>Chancellor,</hi>
and with some few others takes
shipping; shewing how Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
waits upon <hi>Fortune,</hi> and
<hi>changes</hi> with it. They that before
cou'd not be content with so much
<hi>Plenty</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> shew'd now
no more Ambition, than what a
small naked <hi>Island</hi> cou'd satisfie,
where <hi>Safety</hi> was their only <hi>Hope,</hi>
and a chosen <hi>Prison</hi> their <hi>Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:103977:39"/>
The <hi>King</hi> had left the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of the City of <hi>London</hi> to
<hi>Walter Stapleton</hi> Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi>
and Lord Treasurer; but the <hi>City</hi>
to shew their good will to the
<hi>Queen,</hi> among the many Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
she received, gave a bloody
one of their Devotion to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
Success, and struck off
the <hi>Bishop's</hi> Head, and seiz'd the
Tower of <hi>London,</hi> killing many
in their Fury, and acting those
<hi>Lawless Cruelties</hi> that they before
Condem'd.</p>
            <p>These strange Revolutions evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
shew'd the various Powers
of <hi>Adversity</hi> and <hi>Prosperity,</hi> how
it depresses some below them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and lifts up others beyond
their Reason and Consciences:
The <hi>Queen,</hi> that had been before
the repairer of her <hi>Husband's</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
now makes use of them to
her <hi>Husband's</hi> ruin: She that us'd
to bring <hi>Peace</hi> to heal those
Wounds <hi>Ill Councels</hi> had made,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103977:39"/>
brought <hi>War</hi> now to make them
wider; and whilst she Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
those <hi>Diseases</hi> that made
the Nation sick, she made <hi>Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
the <hi>Cure.</hi> But success (as it
was us'd to do) made her not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
act worse than her self, but
worse than those she had so Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd.
At first she only decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
against the <hi>Favourites,</hi> and
perhaps then only design'd their
ruins: but she ought not with the
loss of her own <hi>Vertue,</hi> to try
to Cure what the want of it in
others had caused. But had not
the rapidness of her <hi>Good Fortune</hi>
hurried her so fast from her self,
she might have discern'd she was
expos'd upon so violent a Stream,
as wou'd carry her by its own
Force, and not by her Direction;
and others at last wou'd use that
Power, which, in such Cases as
these are, is seldom retain'd long
by the <hi>Raisers</hi> of it. Mighty Causes,
that bring Disorders, like Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103977:40"/>
raise up things first, and toss
up unthought of Ruines upon
them; and a Succession of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
lasts till the Storm ceases.
No <hi>Age</hi> but this afforded these
Examples, and yet we see it not
powerful enough to teach those,
who would be safe in Vertue, not
to hazard being Corrupted by
Power violently obtain'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> now, with still
encreasing Forces, pursues her fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>King</hi> and <hi>Husband,</hi> and from
<hi>Oxford</hi> marches to <hi>Glocester,</hi> and
from thence to <hi>Bristol,</hi> where
the <hi>King</hi> had put the Earl of
<hi>Arundel,</hi> and <hi>Spencer</hi> the Father
to defend the Place, which was
fortified as well as the time wou'd
give them leave: But this Place
quickly yielded to that success,
which seem'd to deny all hopes to
the <hi>King's</hi> declining Condition.
<hi>Spencer,</hi> was there taken, and
executed with all the Rigour that
<hi>Revenge</hi> and <hi>Conquest</hi> cou'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103977:40"/>
and with as much <hi>Contempt</hi>
of Law, as he and his Son had
formerly shewed. They Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
him without any Tryal,
and prevented his natural <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi>
which cou'd not have
been long, being then Fourscore
years old.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proclamation</hi> was about this
time made, That if the <hi>King</hi>
wou'd come in, and conform
himself to the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
he should be restor'd by the
<hi>General Consent</hi> of the <hi>People.</hi>
But the <hi>King</hi> either durst not, or
his Favourite <hi>Spencer</hi> durst not
let him trust this Declaration.
Such Ministers made desperate,
hold their <hi>King</hi> the safer, the more
sinking their Condition is; and
rather chose that the <hi>Hazard</hi> of
their <hi>Prince</hi> may save them, than
their <hi>Ruin</hi> save their <hi>Prince:</hi>
Though perhaps in his Prosperous
Condition they flatter'd him, that
their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> shou'd
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103977:41"/>
be always <hi>Sacrifices</hi> for him. But
'tis equally strange, that <hi>Princes</hi> in
great Power and Prosperity,
shou'd with pleasure believe <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,</hi>
and that those Interested
<hi>Flatterers</hi> should hope to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
it shews a fatal Weakness in
the one, and loose Designs in the
other.</p>
            <p>Those also that put forth this
<hi>Proclamation</hi> to call the <hi>King</hi> to
his own <hi>Government,</hi> did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
as little desire he shou'd em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it. For this was but once
<hi>done,</hi> and seem'd a thing rather
us'd to <hi>cov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> what was intended,
than a <hi>clear</hi> intention in it self.
For the eager pursuit of the <hi>King</hi>
was still continued, who (as some
say) seeking to Land in <hi>Lundy,</hi>
was driven by Tempest into <hi>Wales,</hi>
and in the Abby of <hi>Nethe</hi> in <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morganshire</hi>
lay some time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd.
From <hi>Hereford</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi>
divided part of her Army, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Command of <hi>Henry</hi> Earl
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103977:41"/>
of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> into <hi>Wales,</hi> in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of the <hi>King,</hi> who by the
means of one <hi>Ryce ap Powel</hi> (who
was well acquainted in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try)
took the <hi>King</hi> in a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery:
This Earl of <hi>Lancaster</hi> was
Brother to him that was behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Pomfret,</hi> and seem'd to shew
a Powerful pursuit of <hi>Blood,</hi> to
bring the King into the Mercy of
a Family where he had shew'd so
little.</p>
            <p>Others say, that the <hi>King</hi> and
and the younger <hi>Spencer</hi> were in
the Castle of <hi>Bristol</hi> when it was
besieged, from whence (fearing
the Event) he with the younger
<hi>Spencer</hi> stole away by night, and
endeavouring to escape by Sea, his
Boat was beaten back; and trying
to put out again, it was discover'd
by the Lord <hi>Beaumont,</hi> who
chas'd them with a small Vessel,
and took the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Spencer</hi> in
it. However they all agree,
that <hi>Spencer</hi> was taken with him,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103977:42"/>
as if the <hi>King</hi> must always appear
inseparably from the Cause of his
Misfortunes.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> that was
taken at <hi>Bristol</hi> with others were
beheaded, at the Instance of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer,</hi>
who now Govern'd the
<hi>Queen's</hi> Affections and Affairs.
This Earl of <hi>Arundell</hi> was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
allowed a brave Character,
and seem'd to be Guilty of no
Fault but Loyalty to an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
King, unless his Relation to
the younger <hi>Spencer,</hi> who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
his Daughter. The same
thing that creates a prosperous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in one Condition, brings
Ruine in another; or else it seem'd
improbable, that so brave a
Gentleman shou'd dye like a
Traytor only for being Loyal.</p>
            <p>The younger <hi>Spencer</hi> was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
along only to Grace the
<hi>Queen's</hi> marching Triumph: and
as the chief Cause of her taking
Arms, he was render'd as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103977:42"/>
a Spectacle as was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
and expos'd in a fitting Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
to increase the Storms and
Reproaches, that use to attend
such miserable Objects: And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
some were mingled in the
Crowd, that had formerly in his
prosperous Greatness saluted him
with fawning Acclamations. At
last he was eased of all his Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
though by a <hi>Death</hi> as full
of Torments, as cou'd be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd,
which yet he endur'd with
much seeming calmness; perhaps
wearied with so much shame and
misery, he might be willing any
way to find an undisturbed Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>A
<hi>Parliament</hi> was presently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
where it was agreed the
<hi>King</hi> shou'd be Depos'd, and
his Son placed in his <hi>Throne;</hi> who
hearing of it, refus'd such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
Succession, without the
Consent and Resignation of his
Father. Commissioners were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103977:43"/>
Deputed, consisting of
<hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> to go to the
<hi>King:</hi> But before they came, the
ready Bishops of <hi>Hereford</hi> and
<hi>Lincoln</hi> had pressed the <hi>King</hi> to
yield to the powerful Decrees of
the Nation; and added, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>no
question, specious Petences how
well he shou'd be provided for,
and live more happily, than the
various Cares of a Crown wou'd
ever permit him: Yet mingled
<hi>Threatnings,</hi> That if he refus'd
quietly to resign to his <hi>Son,</hi> the
Fury of the Incens'd <hi>Nation</hi> wou'd
not only Destroy <hi>Him,</hi> but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
his <hi>Posterity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> seem'd quietly to
submit, and a little after the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
come to receive his <hi>Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
and were seated in a Form
ready for the Ceremony. The
<hi>King</hi> came out in Mourning, and
at the sight of a form'd Power
ready to take away <hi>His,</hi> sunk
down; but being recover'd to a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103977:43"/>
miserable Life, the Bishop of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford</hi>
deliver'd the Cause of their
coming. After which <hi>Trussell</hi> a
Lawyer, and Speaker of the
House of Commons, pronounces a
Form of renouncing all Allegiance
to <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Caernarvon;</hi> to
which (as most Writers say) the
<hi>King</hi> made not the least Answer,
but turn'd about, and went out.
<hi>There</hi> were Articles also exhibited
against him; and his Son with
much Ceremony chosen King in
<hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> with the full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the People; which gave
the occasion to the Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> to choose for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his Sermon, <hi>Vox populi,
Vox Dei;</hi> exhorting the People to
pray for the <hi>King</hi> they had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen:
Thus the Lawyer found out
a Legal Method for the People to
deprive their <hi>King</hi> of Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and the Divines Consecrated
their mighty Power, in calling
their <hi>Voice,</hi> a <hi>Divine Election.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:103977:44"/>
               <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> in his Third
Book takes notice, That the
Great Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> subdu'd
<hi>England</hi> in Eleven days; and
<hi>King Edward</hi> the Fourth reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
it in One and twenty.
Though these were sudden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions,
yet the Fortune of
them was dispos'd by many Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels:
but this was as sudden, yet
without a Blow, which shews no
Force to be greater than the
Power of <hi>Injuries</hi> and <hi>Oppressions.</hi>
For though in Prosperity and the
full gust of Power, this mighty
Force lying (as it were) in an
Ambush in the Vexed Minds of
injur'd Subjects, is undiscern'd
and slighted: And the fatal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents
made by the Errours of
<hi>others,</hi> are seldom made use of to
our <hi>selves;</hi> yet when it begins to
shew it self, it seems no wonder,
that the united Minds of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
for themselves. But Men
are so much their own Flatterers,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103977:44"/>
that they believe every thing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
they wish to be so; and
Favourites that cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to share a <hi>Common Benefit,</hi>
venture at <hi>uncertain Advantages,</hi>
and make it a Principle to depend
more upon Men's Fears than
Love. By the <hi>Mighty</hi> and <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi>
Mischiefs and Disturbances
are wrought, but the <hi>Weak</hi> and
<hi>Moderate</hi> desire Peace and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>The unhappy <hi>King</hi> was now
kept in Confinement with a small
allowance, that he might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of all things, that resemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Princes Condition; and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
now for his unsteady <hi>Errors,</hi>
as much perhaps by the wounding
reflection of their Memory, as
by what he endured for them.
But too late he was taught Truth
by Misery; and saw the Difference
to lose those Friends that cou'd
preserve him, and keep none but
only such as could help to destroy
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103977:45"/>
him. <hi>Princes</hi> sometimes believe
that the right of <hi>Power</hi> should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them, notwithstanding the
want of Conscience in the using
of it. But when their <hi>Errors</hi>
have contracted Enemies, and the
same Errors raised Accidents e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to give power and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to those Enemies, misguid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Princes (like this unhappy
<hi>King</hi>) will find that such with as
much want of Conscience will
revenge their Wrongs, as they
shew'd by the Oppression.</p>
            <p>It now appear'd that the
<hi>Graves</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> are ever near
their <hi>Prisons.</hi> This unhappy one
above all things deplored, That
his <hi>Wife,</hi> whom he had ever loved,
wou'd not be got to see him. But
she was now possessed by her pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for <hi>Mortimer,</hi> that all her
Duty and Vertue was Sacrific'd,
and her <hi>Husband</hi> was now as much
her apprehension as aversion.
<hi>Mortimer</hi> was as jealous as he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103977:45"/>
could be, and never thought
himself safe in his Enjoyments,
while the <hi>King</hi> liv'd. They cou'd
be inform'd of the murmuring
whispers of their Course of Life,
and that hard usage of the <hi>King</hi>
proceeded from thence, and
therefore looked upon the <hi>King's
Death</hi> as their only <hi>security.</hi> His
Keepers were therefore changed
by the advice of that ready Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor
of mischief, the Bishop of
<hi>Hereford;</hi> for Sir <hi>Maurice Berkley,</hi>
in whose Custody he was, had
been tamper'd with, and not
found ready for the intended Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany,
he was therefore taken from
<hi>Henchworth Castle,</hi> and committed
to Sir <hi>Thomas Gourney</hi> and Sir <hi>John
Matravers,</hi> who carry'd him to
<hi>Corf-Castle,</hi> a place (some write)
that he always declared an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
aversion to; from thence
to <hi>Bristol,</hi> from whence upon
some suspicion of a Plot for his
escape, he was convey'd to <hi>Berkley
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103977:46"/>
Castle;</hi> where by those barbarous
Villains he was wretchedly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
with a <hi>hot Iron,</hi> thrust
through a Pipe up behind into his
Bowels; which way they thought
wou'd perhaps make the least
discovery by what Death he died;
though his Groans and Cryes suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
proclaim'd the Violence
of it.</p>
            <p>Some write, That the Bishop
of <hi>Hereford</hi> by a dark Sentence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigated
the Murtherers to hasten
the Execution by this Line; <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardum
occidere nolite Timere bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
est:</hi> At once giving them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
and concealing an
excuse for himself: But Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<hi>Riddles</hi> are dangerous, and
sometimes their <hi>Expositions</hi> of
<hi>Texts</hi> have been no other.</p>
            <p>After this horrid Execution,
the Murderers <hi>Gourney</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travers</hi>
expected Rewards; but
found the <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Bishop</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
rather to threaten and accuse
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103977:46"/>
them, than to own the Service;
and were forc'd to fly beyond Sea
to seek safety for their loath'd
Lives. But <hi>Gourney</hi> after three
years was taken, and sent to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and by the way had his
Head struck off. <hi>Matravers</hi> fled
into <hi>Germany,</hi> where in Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
he had time to wast a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Life.</p>
            <p>This <hi>King</hi> Reigned something
above Eighteen years, and was
<hi>murther'd</hi> in the <hi>43d.</hi> year of his
Life: His Body was carryed to
<hi>Glocester,</hi> and there buryed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Ceremony. His <hi>Character</hi>
I will reserve till I join it with
<hi>Richard</hi> the Second; since the
same Methods and Errors in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
workt the same Effects,
and both <hi>Princes</hi> equally unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate.</p>
            <p>The
Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second
(to which I am now proceeding)
may be justly said to be as <hi>Meze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:103977:47"/>
calls the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the
Third of <hi>France</hi> [<hi>The Reign of
Favourites</hi>] who did enervate all
his Vertues, and dispos'd him to
looseness and carelesness; dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen'd
and confounded him with
Flatteries, prompting to observe
no <hi>Law</hi> but his <hi>Will,</hi> while they
were the Disposers of all things.
At which many great Men and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
retired discontented, and
left the Favourite-Ministers at
large to pursue their Ambition,
and with new Inventions to waste,
and pillage the <hi>King's</hi> Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.</p>
            <p>This
Description suits with the
beginning of this unfortunate
King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the death of his <hi>Grandfather,</hi>
that great Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third, succeeded him in the
Throne: His Father the Famous
<hi>Black Prince,</hi> dying in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
time; who by contrary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
to what they us'd, met as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103977:47"/>
contrary Fortunes. The Comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Beauty of his Person
(exceeding all his Predecessors)
only seem'd to Entitle him to a
Generous <hi>Father,</hi> and as beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
a <hi>Mother.</hi> But that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Person, which might have
become <hi>great Actions,</hi> was turned
to <hi>Looseness</hi> and <hi>Pleasures;</hi> and
Flatterers broke in to encourage
that dissolute Carelesness, which
they found wou'd be suitable to
his Nature, and their Ambitious
Designs.</p>
            <p>The three chief Favourites and
Ministers were <hi>Robert Vere</hi> Earl of
<hi>Oxford,</hi> afterwards Marquiss of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Ireland:
Michael Delapool</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk;</hi>
and <hi>Robert Tresilian</hi> Lord Chief
Justice. The Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi>
seem'd the best, as hardly he cou'd
do otherwise, being set with two
such <hi>Foils;</hi> but he wanted Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Courage, without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of Vices of the other two.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103977:48"/>
               <hi>Michael Delapoole</hi> was a model of
complicated Vices; in Peace the
most odiously Insolent, in War
the most dejectedly Contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
He despised all methods of
<hi>Quietness,</hi> and yet was frighted
with the least <hi>Disturbance. Tresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
the Chief Justice was one that
never shew'd his Place or Title by
any practice, but ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
all <hi>Law</hi> to Occasion, and
<hi>Justice</hi> to Designs: His <hi>Knowledg</hi>
was <hi>Lewdness,</hi> and his <hi>Vertue Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;</hi>
what others design'd he was
ready to execute, and being kept
up in this Darkness, he grew
fierce on all things that were cast
to him.</p>
            <p>This <hi>King</hi> was called <hi>Richard</hi>
of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> because born there,
the only Son of the <hi>Black Prince.</hi>
By his Grandfather <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third he was in his Life time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
his Successor: And after
his Death was Crowned at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
(in the year 1377) by <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103977:48"/>
Sudbury</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
with great Solemnity.
The <hi>King</hi> being then eleven years
old. The Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi>
and <hi>Edmund</hi> Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
the King's Uncles, with other
Lords and Bishops, were joyned
in Commission to manage the
State.</p>
            <p>The Minority of the King gave
foreign Princes an Opinion, that
it was a proper time to attempt
upon <hi>England;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> first
laid hold on the Occasion, and
landed Forces, and did some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
and burnt some places near
the Sea: As about <hi>Rye, Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,
Dartmouth,</hi> and <hi>Plimouth;</hi>
as also, <hi>Hastings</hi> and <hi>Winchelsea:</hi>
The Scots also assaulted the Castle
of <hi>Berwick,</hi> and won it, but it
was taken again by the Earls of
<hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Nottingham,</hi>
and all put to the Sword, but <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey,</hi>
who took it by a bold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
attempt with a few Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:103977:49"/>
These troubles occasion'd a
<hi>Parliament</hi> to be called at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
where <hi>Alice Pearce</hi> the
Concubine to the late King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Third was banish'd,
and all her Goods confiscated: A
Tax was then given of two
Tenths of the Clergy, and two
Fifteenths of the Temporalty:
Others write the Tax was a Poll
of four Pence upon every Head;
but which way soever it was, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Levying it, or the Tax it
self, caused a sudden and strange
<hi>Insurrection,</hi> begun by the infusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of one <hi>Wiat,</hi> a Factious Priest,
using these Common Notions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
great Men, who had power
to oppress others, and ruine the
meaner sort to support their
Greatness and Luxuries. This
spread to the City, who gave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
that they were ready
to join with the Rabble, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
gather'd from many adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Countries. This confused
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103977:49"/>
Body chose one <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> for
their Captain, whose Assistants,
or Privy-Councellers, were <hi>John
Ball, Jack Straw,</hi> and <hi>Jack Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blackheath</hi>
(as they marched
to <hi>London</hi>) was their Rendezvous,
where they appeared to be above
Threescore Thousand; From
thence they marched to <hi>London,</hi>
declaring themselves for the <hi>King</hi>
and <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they came to <hi>London,</hi>
they were received either for Fear
or Love, with all freedom, and
treated as if they strove who
shou'd express themselves best to
the flatter'd Rebels, who (like
such a Mass of Giddiness got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
committed nothing but
Murther and Violence; They
burnt the <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Lancaster</hi>'s House; they rifled the
<hi>Temple,</hi> and destroyed the <hi>Law-Books,</hi>
expressing a Spleen against
any thing of that Nature; Nor
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103977:50"/>
were Churches or Religious Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
spared; the good they pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
the ill they cherished, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all Prisoners at Liberty; their
Chief Leader, <hi>Tyler,</hi> remembring
some Punishment that his old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
<hi>Richard Lyon,</hi> had inflicted
on him, for some Crime he had
committed, without any more
Tryal or Judgment than what his
Revenge allowed, caused his Head
to be stricken off, and carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him on a Spear. Their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
were now so great, that the
King durst not resist their Entrance
into the <hi>Tower,</hi> where they abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his <hi>Mother,</hi> and took the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the <hi>Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi>
and <hi>Lord Treasurer,</hi> and drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
them to <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
them.</p>
            <p>In the midst of all these Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages,
the <hi>King</hi> proclaim'd a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
to all that wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d go quietly
home; which the <hi>Essex</hi> men, and
some others accepted; but the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103977:50"/>
               <hi>Kentish</hi> and others stayed with
their Captain <hi>Tyler:</hi> So that it
seem'd as if part of this Rabble
were not in the secret intention
to subvert the Government, and
throw down all above themselves
from Oppression: About 20000.
continued with their Captain:
The <hi>King</hi> looking upon this as
a good beginning, presented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in Person before the Rebels,
and spoke to them with all sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
promising them Pardon and
Favour; but had so rude a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from <hi>Tyler,</hi> that instead of
Submission, he demanded the
King's Sword; at which the <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi>
of <hi>London</hi> drew his, and struck
him to the ground, where he was
presently killed. The Rabble
seem'd to threaten Revenge;
But the <hi>City</hi> hearing this, and
thinking it high time to free their
<hi>King</hi> and themselves from Ruine
and Destruction, came to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
with a body of men; at
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103977:51"/>
which sight the affrighted Rebels
yielded, and some fled, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
up their <hi>Ringleader;</hi> a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
that seldom fails to be made
by such Tumults. <hi>Jack Straw,</hi> at
his Execution, confessed their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of destroying all that were
above them in Name or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi>'s chief Favourites
now appeared to be <hi>Michael Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poole,</hi>
made <hi>Chancellor</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
and after <hi>Earl</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk;
Robert de Vere, Marquess</hi> of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> and after <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
Alexander Archbishop</hi> of
<hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Tresilian</hi> the <hi>Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi>
The first Testimony that
these shewed of their Animosities
against the Methods of a just Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
was the displacing Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Scroope, Lord Chancellor,</hi>
who in all things used an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
uprightness, which was an
Offence to their loose and partial
Designs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:103977:51"/>
But they did not only sharpen
the King's Nature against men in
point of Offices and Employments,
but against their <hi>Lives.</hi> The first
appearance of this was by the
Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> whose <hi>Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
were likewise from his <hi>Vertues,</hi>
and his Ruine therefore contrived
by them, and resolv'd by <hi>Tresili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
to be done by <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Law;</hi>
the worst sort of <hi>destroying</hi> when
violated; but when truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
the best <hi>defence</hi> against <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are seldom any <hi>extream
Proceedings</hi> in a <hi>Government,</hi> but
there are <hi>depraved persons</hi> enough
in all Conditions ready to swim
with the <hi>stream,</hi> and take the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of any Tide of Fortune: For
when <hi>Mischief</hi> is to be practised,
<hi>Corruption</hi> is the Consequence;
and there are always those ready,
whom no Consideration ballances
in their Natures with Honour and
Benefit. <hi>Tresilian</hi> was one of those
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103977:52"/>
thus prepared, and cou'd hardly
want as well-condition'd <hi>Informers</hi>
and <hi>Juries:</hi> Occasions preserved
from men is the surest Cause of
their Vertue; but offered from
those that should depress it, is the
Cause and Temptation of Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
Crimes were prepared for
the <hi>Duke,</hi> he never committed; a
Jury of <hi>Lords</hi> were fix'd, and it
was not only design'd he shou'd
be arrested, but his <hi>Condemnation</hi>
was as confidently resolved and
concluded.</p>
            <p>These things were not so secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contriv'd, but the Duke of
<hi>Lancaster</hi> had notice of them, and
privately retir'd, or rather fled to
<hi>Pomfret-Castle,</hi> where he prepar'd
to defend himself; and already
<hi>Discontents</hi> grew so high, that he
wanted not assistance for it, and
grew so considerable, that the
<hi>Queen-Mother</hi> thought it worthy
her pains in all respects to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
a <hi>Composure,</hi> which she effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103977:52"/>
assisted by the apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of her <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Duty</hi> which
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lancaster</hi> seem'd yet
to retain; so that for this time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing was compos'd, unless
their Minds, which once shaken
by indirectness and mistrust, are
seldom so purely clear'd, but that
some Seeds of <hi>Jealousie</hi> lie ready
to spring upon the heat of any
Difference. Without Trust, the
<hi>Traffick</hi> amongst Dealers in petty
things can never be carried on,
and much less the <hi>Commerce</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Subjects,</hi> without
<hi>Credit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> now enter'd upon
the assuming the <hi>Government</hi> into
his own Hands, and from this
time grew liable to his own Errors,
appearing wholly regardless of all
his great <hi>Relations</hi> and <hi>Nobility,</hi>
and only seem'd kind to a fondness
of his <hi>Chancellor,</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Suffolk,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and their two subservient
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103977:53"/>
Friends, the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi>
and <hi>Tresilian</hi> the Chief Justice,
they that had now gain'd the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the King's Power and
Inclination, shew'd a great Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of their ill use of it, by
disposing the <hi>King</hi> against his
brave <hi>Vncle</hi> the Duke of <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
and the Earls of <hi>Warwick</hi> and
<hi>Arundel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> was now wholly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
by these Favourites, and in a
particular manner by the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
<hi>Delapoole,</hi> whose mean Birth
was suitable to his Qualities: His
<hi>Vices</hi> so many, that he was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a <hi>Grievance;</hi> and it seem'd a
fatal unhappiness, that the <hi>King's
Conscience</hi> should be intrusted unto
so bad a Keeper; but the <hi>King</hi> was
as violent in his <hi>Affections</hi> as others
could be in their <hi>Displeasures;</hi> He
seldom regarded what others
thought, till necessity forced the
Consideration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:103977:53"/>
These men that both fear'd and
hated any men of Honour and
Quality, that might have Interest
to cross their Designs, laid hold
of an Occassion to be rid of one
of the greatest, the Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi>
by assisting him with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to conquer <hi>Spain,</hi> which he
claim'd in right of his Wife <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
Daughter and Co-heir of
<hi>Peter</hi> (who was surnamed the
<hi>Cruel</hi>), King of <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Leon:</hi>
With very considerable Forces he
sail'd for <hi>Spain;</hi> He landed at the
<hi>Troyne,</hi> and at <hi>Compostella</hi> met with
the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> where a
Marriage was concluded with his
Daughter; and after some <hi>Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
made into the Countrey of
<hi>Castile, a Peace</hi> and <hi>Marriage</hi> was
also effected between the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s Eldest Son, and <hi>Katharine</hi>
of <hi>Lancaster;</hi> and so resign'd the
Title to <hi>Spain</hi> for a Composition,
by a sum of Money and a Pension.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:103977:54"/>
This look't like the <hi>feeble Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
of violent and self-interested
<hi>Counsellors,</hi> which was applied to
Men and not to Things, as if the
removal of Two or Three that
oppos'd their Designs, took all
the Danger away that attended
them: As long as there were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
men, they must have Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and their safety was no
way probable but by better Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Practices: Besides, there
were other Lords left behind,
made Popular by the same Errors:
But they design'd to ruine, if they
cou'd, all that were in their way;
and after grew very busie in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
to murder the Duke of
<hi>Glocester,</hi> every day contriving
some ill, and by their heavy wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
loading their <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little after the Rebellion, the
<hi>King</hi> married with <hi>Anne,</hi> the
<hi>Daughter</hi> of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi>
the Fourth, whom he loved passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately;
for whose sake he refus'd
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103977:54"/>
the Daughter of the Duke of
<hi>Milan,</hi> who was offer'd him, and
with her a <hi>Dowry</hi> much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable:
She liv'd with him
Twelve Years, but without <hi>Issue,</hi>
and died at <hi>Sheen</hi> by <hi>Richmond;</hi>
which great loss made the place e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hated after by the <hi>King,</hi> who
in all things shew'd he was a Man
of great <hi>Affections;</hi> which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Vertues when wrong
placed.</p>
            <p>About this time the <hi>King</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> his <hi>Heir</hi>
and <hi>Successor,</hi> who was the Son
of <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> Third
Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third,
who was afterwards killed in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
He also created his Uncles,
<hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>Langley,</hi> Duke of
<hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Woodstock,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and his Cousin
<hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bullingbrooke</hi> (Son and
Heir to his Fourth Uncle, <hi>John</hi> of
<hi>Gaunt,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi>), Earl
of <hi>Derby:</hi> His Cousin <hi>Edward
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103977:55"/>
Plantagenet</hi> (Son and Heir to his
Uncle <hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>Langley</hi>), he
created Earl of <hi>Rutland;</hi> Sir <hi>John
Holland</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> and
<hi>Thomas Mowbray</hi> Earl of <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In
the Parliament, in which
these Creations were made, was
exhibited a Charge of many Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
and of very great Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
against Chancellor <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poole;</hi>
in which one particular was
the abusing and cozening the <hi>King.</hi>
But this had only an Audience,
and no Examination, which gave
so much offence, that an <hi>Aid</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
was denied; and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
given, that it was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to give money, when the ill
use of it was countenanced.
This seem'd a wrong Method to
ask and be denied, and at the
same time neither to have Power
enough to enforce, nor Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to obtain; but 'twas not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for his Favourites to tell him
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103977:55"/>
they doubted success with his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
since that were to own
such <hi>apprehensions</hi> sprung from their
ambitious <hi>Errors.</hi> But Princes are
rightly said to be us'd like fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Children, flatter'd, and
condemn'd never to hear the
Truth.</p>
            <p>But the Parliament still pressed
the Examination of the Charge;
and the Necessity of the King's
Affairs, concurring with their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
procured what they so
warmly desired: The Cause was
put to selected <hi>Noblemen</hi> to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;
and a Subsidy seem'd the
purchase of it, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
granted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cause</hi> then being heard by
his <hi>Peers,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi>
and Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> being Two
of the Judges, he was convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
deprived of his Office and
Chattels, and condemn'd to be
executed: But all this seem'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Arguments</hi> of <hi>Merit,</hi> than
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103977:56"/>
               <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Punishment;</hi> For the
<hi>King</hi> presently after restored him
into the former Favour, as if he
had suffer'd for his sake. Thus as
<hi>Edward</hi> the Second received <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veston</hi>
from Banishment, and his
Subjects hate, to his Arms and
Love; so this unfortunate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
<hi>King</hi> received this Earl
of <hi>Suffolk</hi> from Execution, and
the Prosecution of his Parliament,
to increas'd Affection and Trust;
as if <hi>Crimes</hi> found out, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
by a Parliament, had been
the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of <hi>Merit,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi>
for a <hi>Prince's Fnvour:</hi>
These unsteddy Councils increas'd
mistrust in the Subjects, who now
began to see they were too light to
make a Poisure with his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites:
And to confirm their worst
<hi>apprehensions,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
who had been driven away
by the Displeasure that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
against him, now return'd
with equal Credit and Principles
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103977:56"/>
with the Earl of <hi>Suffolk;</hi> to whom
also joined the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi>
to strengthen their Power, and
weaken their <hi>King</hi>'s; for they who
had influence enough to make a
<hi>Prince</hi> believe their Cause to be
his, might easily carry him on to
revenge these Affronts, he now
assumed to be his own: To this
belongs the same Fate that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
indirect unsteddy Counsels;
they must be maintained by the
Ruine or Oppression of those that
suffer'd by them, and no method
taken for the Preservation of any,
but they that merited the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The
Argument that was, and
must be used to deceive <hi>Princes,</hi>
was then enforced by these <hi>Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite-Ministers,</hi>
That the Arrows
shot at them, were intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Prince;</hi> and 'twas but
a method of Rebellion to confine
a <hi>King,</hi> on whom to confer his
Favour; and therefore to avoid
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103977:57"/>
the Dishonour of a <hi>Limited Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
he must now use Power, and
declare his Trust in that only.
With this flattery, they raise their
<hi>King</hi> to a fatal Confidence in that,
which must in time deceive mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided
Princes: For perhaps, for
some time, Apprehension and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
may preserve a shew of
Peace, yet at last Errour and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
will disturb such a weak-setled
Calm.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> thus rais'd by <hi>Flattery</hi>
above his <hi>Power,</hi> and sharpned by
false Arguments beyond his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
they proceed seemingly to
act his Cause, but really to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
themselves; and (like the
other Favourites in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s
Time) wrap their <hi>Prince</hi>'s Fall
and Hazard, and their own to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
while they are only the
King's <hi>Loyal Subjects,</hi> and the
Kingdom his and their own <hi>guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:103977:57"/>
The <hi>Memory</hi> of <hi>Suffolk</hi>'s Tryal
and <hi>Condemnation,</hi> was the first
Cause that incited them against
those that were his Judges, the
Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> and others, on
whose Destruction they first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
as being the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable;
nor feared his near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the <hi>King,</hi> for they knew
their Power was gotten above his
Nature or Consideration. The
first Design was to invite <hi>Glocester</hi>
and others to a Supper in <hi>London,</hi>
and there murther them; which
(some write) was discover'd by the
Duke to <hi>Exton,</hi> the then Mayor
of <hi>London;</hi> and so the Mischief
was prevented for that time.</p>
            <p>About this time the Earls of
<hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Nottingham</hi> (who
were engaged with the Duke of
<hi>Glocester,</hi> in the Tryal and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Chancellour <hi>Suffolk</hi>)
Commanded the Navy; and did
so many brave Actions, that all
mouths were fill'd with just Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103977:58"/>
the King's only excepted, to
whom Satisfaction did most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long:
For at their Return, they
found such a cold Reception from
the <hi>King,</hi> that it seem'd they were
rather forgiven for Misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
than receiv'd for Merits: The
strangeness of his Words told too
plainly, That <hi>publick Merit</hi> lost
its Nature, when the <hi>Desert</hi> was
in the Enemies of his Favourites.</p>
            <p>How much more limited is a
<hi>King,</hi> by such as inflame him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Dishonour of it? He
must neither reward <hi>Vertue,</hi> nor
punish <hi>Vice;</hi> his best and bravest
Subjects must not be esteem'd, nor
his worst question'd nor punish'd.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with as
much Arbitrary Power as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
the <hi>King</hi> to assume, put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his <hi>Wife,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>'s
Daughter; and marryed a
Vintners, some say a Joyners Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
The injur'd <hi>Lady</hi> often pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition'd
the <hi>King,</hi> but without
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103977:58"/>
success, her Injury was done by
a Favourite, where his Nature
was more tyed than to his own
Blood: Upon no less nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can growing Favourites pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper,
than by their Princes loss
of Interest and Honour.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> bore
it not so calmy; but told the
Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> plainly, he
wou'd revenge it, who from that
time grew more assiduous to
contrive the Destruction of the
Duke of <hi>Glcester,</hi> but at the
present his pretended Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to <hi>Ireland</hi> kept all silent,
which after many delays he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
began; and was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
in great State by the <hi>King</hi>
himself, the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and
the ready Chief Justice <hi>Tresilian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this proved only a Journey
through <hi>Wales,</hi> and so about to
<hi>Nottingham,</hi> where they enter'd
in private and <hi>black Consultations.</hi>
The first was to <hi>destroy</hi> the Lords;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103977:59"/>
and for that end summon'd the
Sheriffs of every County; and
plainly asked them what they
cou'd promise against the Lords,
if the <hi>King</hi> should require it:
Their Answers were for the most
part, That the People were very
much satisfied in their Opinions,
That the <hi>Lords</hi> were lovers of
their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
durst promise nothing in that
matter.</p>
            <p>The Tryal was then made to
pack a <hi>Parliament,</hi> by contriving
<hi>Elections</hi> as the <hi>King</hi> should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point:
But this received as cold
a return.</p>
            <p>To what a lose Hazard they
had now reduced their <hi>King,</hi> to
attempt unsuccessfully to break
by <hi>force,</hi> or in a Legal way to
make the Nation destroy it self:
The last was without question, the
most dangerous design, <hi>force</hi> may
enslave for little time, but <hi>slavery
by Law</hi> is like to endure longer,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103977:59"/>
but the People were not then
couzen'd enough; and indeed it
must be the Concurrence of
strange Accidents, the fairness of
an undiscover'd Dissimulation,
and the Opportunity embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the same Moment, that
must so infatuate the People,
as to make their Ruin their
Choice.</p>
            <p>The last attempt was design'd
by surer means, the <hi>Judges,</hi> who
kept and seem'd to deserve their
Places for the Compliance; of
these were summoned the two
Chief Justices <hi>Tresilian</hi> and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knap</hi>
with others, and to them were
put <hi>Queries,</hi> which might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the safety of the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi>
and the danger of all they
pleased beside.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Questions</hi> were to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
so large a <hi>Treason,</hi> that it
could not miss to find <hi>Traitors;</hi>
for, by them resolved, the very <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
of the Nation was <hi>Treason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:103977:60"/>
The first <hi>four Queries</hi> concern'd
the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> most particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
and with him all Favourites:
For the Case was put, Whether the
Law it self, and the <hi>Commission</hi> for
his Tryal, did not derogate from
the Kings Authority? and then
how they were to be proceeded
with, that procured such a <hi>Law?</hi>
and how they were to be dealt
with, that provoked the King to
assent to it?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth Question:</hi> What they
merited that oppos'd the Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
or releasing <hi>Penalties,</hi> or
<hi>Debts</hi> due to him?</p>
            <p>The sixth, seventh, eighth and
ninth, consisted of Questions,
Whether <hi>Parliaments</hi> could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
upon any business, but such
as the <hi>King</hi> should propose and
limit by Articles? And whether
the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> assembled
in Parliament might accuse any of
the <hi>King's Officers</hi> without his
<hi>Leave?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:103977:60"/>
The <hi>Tenth</hi> was singly for the
Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> Whether the
<hi>Judgment</hi> given in the last <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
against him, were <hi>Erroneous</hi>
and <hi>Revocable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis improbable, that such que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
as these shou'd be propos'd
to any Persons, that had the
Names of <hi>Justices,</hi> unless there
had been before a received assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the <hi>Answers</hi> they wou'd
give. Accordingly it appear'd,
for they returned not any answer
doubtingly or modestly, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
all to be <hi>Treason,</hi> and
the Offenders worthy the <hi>death</hi> of
<hi>Traytors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>last Article</hi> they resolved
with as much clearness (<hi>viz.</hi>) That
the Proceedings and Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> were
<hi>Erroneous</hi> and <hi>Revocable;</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
deliver'd these bald O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
under their Hands and
Seals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:103977:61"/>
It seem'd as if they durst judge
no Crime less than Treason, that
offended the Ministers; though
by their bold Opinions, the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
it self became the <hi>Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>
and a <hi>Statute Law</hi> the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This
I suppose was highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
by the <hi>Ministers,</hi> and the
<hi>King</hi> flatter'd to believe what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Servants he had of such
Judges, by whose briskness not
only the <hi>Law,</hi> but the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<hi>Constitution</hi> it self of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
might be rendred as useless as
Arbitrary Power cou'd desire:
For if such Laws that seem'd to
limit a <hi>King,</hi> shou'd in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
become void for that very
Cause, there could no Law be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
but such as pleas'd the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
who was the <hi>Judge</hi> of his
own <hi>Infringment;</hi> and then all
past <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> to be made,
would become but prostituted
<hi>Writings</hi> to the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:103977:61"/>
Perhaps at that time these Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
had the Character of being
the most <hi>Loyal,</hi> for appearing most
<hi>desperate,</hi> giving that great Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of their Devotion, that
their Zeal for the <hi>Favourites</hi> was
far warmer than for their <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi>
and involved themselves in
their Fortunes by Principles as
leud as their Designs.</p>
            <p>The King looked upon the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion</hi>
of these Judges as <hi>Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
and of <hi>validity</hi> enough to
throw legally into his power the
<hi>Estates</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> of those
<hi>Lords</hi> that appeared most Eminent
against his <hi>Ministers;</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
he began to dispose of their
Estates among those that he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
presuming them (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
farther Tryal) Convicted
Persons; and to maintain this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
by a worse, rais'd Soldiers
privately, and sent to surprize the
Earl of <hi>Arundel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:103977:62"/>
The Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> having In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of all these proceedings,
got the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the King from such Violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and to assure him that he had
never had an undutiful thought
against him; and intimated how
much more safe and Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
it wou'd be for the <hi>King</hi>
not to be led by false suggestions
to such a fatal difference and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
with his best and greatest
Subjects.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bishop</hi> performed this,
with his best Skill and Zeal; and
wrought so upon the <hi>King,</hi> that
he seem'd inclin'd to a more
happy Temper; but the Duke of
<hi>Suffolk,</hi> that had all Peace and
Justice (by which he knew he
was to have little Benfit, nor
cou'd be probably safe longer than
while he kept his <hi>King</hi> in danger)
quickly nipt the <hi>King</hi>'s budding
Gentleness, and, like an untimely
Frost, blasted the springing Hopes
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103977:62"/>
of Peace, falling upon the <hi>Bishop</hi>
with harsh and insolent Reproofs:
But the <hi>Bishop</hi> not daunted with
his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Greatness,</hi> boldly
told him, That it was not the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>
of his <hi>Prince</hi> that guided him,
but his own <hi>violent Ambition;</hi> and
that rather than the <hi>Lords</hi> shou'd
not be destroy'd, he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
the <hi>Nations</hi> in Ruine: Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
That it was easie for such
abject Spirits as his, to raise Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
which must be ended by
the Ruine of the Bravest; nor was
he fit to give Advice, that was
the chief <hi>Incendiary,</hi> and made a
Party by his <hi>Condemnation.</hi> The
<hi>King</hi> was so angry to see his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
so roughly and boldly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked,
that he commanded the
<hi>Bishop</hi> out of his sight.</p>
            <p>In this particular, as in most of
the <hi>King</hi>'s unhappy <hi>Actions,</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
against <hi>Himself</hi> and his own
<hi>Reason,</hi> being guided by the Duke
of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who was of a contrary
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103977:63"/>
Interest, turn'd from his own <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>Reason,</hi> by one that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Bowels;</hi> and by this
Unsteddiness, kindled new Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusts,
the fruitful Nourishers of
Civil Mischiefs.</p>
            <p>At this, the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi>
the Earls of <hi>Arundel, Warwick,</hi>
and <hi>Derby,</hi> take Arms; the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi>
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Bishop</hi> of
<hi>Ely</hi> (then Lord Chancellour) were
sent to the <hi>Lords;</hi> who compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Matters so well, that the <hi>Lords</hi>
agreed to appear before the <hi>King</hi>
at <hi>Westminster,</hi> under the Promise
of Protection: But retaining their
usual Jealousies, they receiv'd the
<hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ely</hi>'s Assurance, That if
there were any Danger design'd
them, he would give them notice.
Accordingly he kept his Word;
and a little before the <hi>Lords</hi> were
to come, he gave them Intelligence
of an Ambush laid for them at the
<hi>Mews,</hi> to seize them as they came
in: Upon this, the <hi>Lords</hi> fail'd of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103977:63"/>
their coming; which the <hi>King</hi>
wondring at, ask'd the Bishop of
<hi>Ely,</hi> What might be the Reason?
who boldly told him, That the
<hi>Lords</hi> durst not trust him, and had
discover'd the Trap laid for them:
Of which the <hi>King</hi> seem'd to be
wholly ignorant, and commanded
the Sheriffs to search the <hi>Mews,</hi> and
to kill and carry to Prison all they
found conceal'd: But the Thing
was true, though the Place mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken;
for the armed Men were
secretly assembled at <hi>Westminster</hi>
by Sir <hi>Richard Bramber,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Thomas Trivett;</hi> who perceiving
or being inform'd of the Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
secretly convey'd away their
Men.</p>
            <p>It seem'd as if the <hi>King</hi> were
really ignorant of this that was
acted by the desperate <hi>Ministers,</hi>
who shew'd a full Confidence in
the Power they had with the
<hi>King:</hi> And tho' perhaps they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
the Action too vile to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103977:64"/>
trust the <hi>King</hi> with it, yet they
did not doubt to bring him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it, tho' never so base, if
successful enough: Nor hath this
been an unusual Method of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
Ministers and Favourites, to
contrive Mischiefs for their <hi>Prince</hi>
to approve; knowing that it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
from the necessity of a Thing
done, to gain an <hi>Approbation,</hi> than
a <hi>Consent</hi> to the Attempt of it: For
a <hi>Prince</hi> that is wholly led by
them, and wrapt up in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
Counsels and Interests,
may scruple at a thing to be done,
that he cannot when 'tis effected:
One is but a <hi>difference</hi> in Opinion,
the other is a <hi>deser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion</hi> of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
he may be free in the first,
but too much involved to be at
liberty in the latter.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Prince</hi> in this Condition, has
not only his own Errours, but the
weight of theirs to struggle under;
and 'tis impossible he shou'd make
any Calculation of his own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103977:64"/>
unless he were free to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the mischievous Effects of
those ill Planets, that he Himself
had rais'd to such powerful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences.</p>
            <p>At last, upon new Faith and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
the <hi>Lords</hi> came to the
<hi>King</hi> at <hi>Westminster;</hi> but so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
guarded, that they did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
like Men that came to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
or Petition: Accordingly
they challenged for <hi>Traytors</hi> the
Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Suffolk,</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi>
the Chief Justice <hi>Tresilian,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
The <hi>King</hi> at that time,
when Favourites could not speak,
spoke like himself (a <hi>King</hi>) and
with equal Temper and Reason,
shew'd the <hi>Lords,</hi> That if all were
true they alledged, they had not
taken the proper way too seek for
<hi>Justice,</hi> by a shew of <hi>Rebellion;</hi>
and give that opportunity to the
licentious Multitude, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
might be difficult to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103977:65"/>
from them: And, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gently laid before them the
more proper way for what they
desired, he raised them from their
knees, and retired with them.</p>
            <p>All this while, the adverse Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
kept out of the way, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
as justly they might, the
danger of such powerful and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
Enemies.</p>
            <p>This Action of the <hi>King</hi> is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd
by some Historians, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
done out of Apprehension,
or a better Temper: But yet all
this while that things bore this calm
face, the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Forces, and was met and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
by the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> near
<hi>Burford:</hi> But he that was so bold
in Counsel, shew'd little of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
(when 'twas needful) in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and fled himself before the
Fight scarce began.</p>
            <p>Among many things that were
taken of the Duke's, in one of his
Trunks were found Letters from
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103977:65"/>
the <hi>King</hi> to hasten his coming to
<hi>London,</hi> with what Power he could
make, where the <hi>King</hi> wou'd be
ready to share Fortunes with
him.</p>
            <p>Upon the news of the Duke of
<hi>Ireland</hi>'s Defeat, the Duke of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi>
fled in a Disguise to <hi>Calice,</hi> and
never more returned.</p>
            <p>It is a wonder that ever such a
Man shou'd get the ascendant over
a <hi>Prince;</hi> a Man that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
of what he cou'd get; and got
it as willingly by the Spoils of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as by justifiable Ways. He
was unfit for Peace, by his turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Nature, and wanted <hi>Courage</hi>
to be troublesome in <hi>War.</hi> In
<hi>Peace,</hi> he was <hi>furious;</hi> in <hi>War, calm;</hi>
never quiet, but when afraid; at
all other times intemperate: When
he was not designing Mischief,
his Courage or Occasion fail'd him.
He never seem'd good, but when
necessity hindred him from appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
bad: He had no Fits of a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103977:66"/>
Disease, but liv'd in a continual
Leprosie.</p>
            <p>But we have read of other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents,
how worthless Men have
fcru'd themselves into <hi>Princes Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi>
by such <hi>Flatteries,</hi> that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Tempers cou'd not creep
to: For ill Men study the <hi>Nature</hi>
of <hi>Princes,</hi> good Men their <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;</hi>
and that which is most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
sooner prevails than that
which is most useful.</p>
            <p>The Chief Justice <hi>Tresilian,</hi> with
others of that <hi>Faction,</hi> fled from
this Storm, and the <hi>King</hi> retir'd
to the <hi>Tower,</hi> while the <hi>Lords</hi> with
a great Army march'd towards
<hi>London,</hi> and shew'd themselves in
a form of Battel to the <hi>King,</hi> who
lay with his Forces in the Suburbs.
The <hi>King</hi> at first seem'd to slight
them, but at last yielded a Treaty.
The <hi>Tower</hi> was the place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but the <hi>Lords</hi> first made
what search they pleas'd, and came
with such Guards as they thought
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103977:66"/>
fit; at once shewing the severe
effects of <hi>Mistrust</hi> and <hi>Power;</hi> the
first seldom to be cured; the last,
as seldom us'd with Modesty: For
when they came to the <hi>King,</hi> they
plainly charg'd him by way of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
of the <hi>Contrivances</hi> at <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham</hi>
against them; his <hi>Letters</hi>
to the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> (contrary
to his <hi>Word</hi>) to raise Forces; the
Agreement with the <hi>French</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
up <hi>Calice;</hi> and other <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances</hi>
which the ill Conduct of
the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Ministers</hi> had plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
furnish'd them with.</p>
            <p>At these <hi>Truths,</hi> told by those
that had Power enough to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
the <hi>King</hi> instead of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
sunk into a Confession of
his <hi>Errours;</hi> which seem'd at that
time to make a great Impression on
the <hi>Lords,</hi> and produced the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a meeting at <hi>Westminster</hi>
the next day.</p>
            <p>But they were no sooner gone,
but the <hi>King</hi>'s Mind was turn'd
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103977:67"/>
by <hi>Arguments</hi> of the common
frame, That by the Meeting, he
wou'd expose his <hi>Person</hi> to danger,
and his <hi>Authority</hi> to diminution.
Which presently chang'd the <hi>King,</hi>
and shew'd as if a fatal <hi>Mutability</hi>
was to pursue him to his end. To
such dangerous Methods he must
probably be led by the Counsels
of those, whose desperate Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
cou'd permit no directness to
be us'd towards their <hi>Enemies</hi> the
<hi>Publick.</hi> Such <hi>Ministers</hi> are the
Consulters of Moments, shifting
only for a present Preservation,
and dare not look towards the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but refer Things to come, to
the same Chance that rais'd them:
They live to no <hi>Rules,</hi> but with an
unlimited readiness wait upon Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
            <p>This
<hi>Alteration</hi> in the <hi>King,</hi> rais'd
the <hi>Lords</hi> to such a rage, that they
sent him word, That if he us'd such
Indirectness, they wou'd choose a
New <hi>King.</hi> At this being again
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103977:67"/>
shaken, he not only went, but
submitted to those he had so
enrag'd before; and delivers up
that <hi>Power,</hi> which he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
counsell'd not to diminish:
So that his ill-tim'd Counsels
made that Misfortune sure,
which they seem'd careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
            <p>A
<hi>Parliament</hi> was presently
called, where <hi>Tresilian</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Chief Justice was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
and presently execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
as also the other Chief
Justice, <hi>Belknap,</hi> and other Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and some banish'd. The
<hi>Lords</hi> grew now so high by
their Success, that they exacted
an Oath from their <hi>King,</hi> to
become a <hi>Subject</hi> to them, and
<hi>submit</hi> to their <hi>Government.</hi> Thus
when <hi>Errours</hi> provoke <hi>Force,</hi>
'tis hard for those Jealousies
that urg'd the Attempt of <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:103977:68"/>
to suffer it to be us'd mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly,
much less to be laid
down when obtain'd: And when
once a State begins to be tost
by such Commotions, Parties in
that Tempest, like Waves in
Storms, pursue and dash out one
another.</p>
            <p>Within little more than a
Year after this, the <hi>King</hi> grew
to be One and Twenty; and
upon that took an Occasion,
when all things seem'd a little
compos'd, to assume full Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
I cannot but here remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the <hi>Character</hi> the Impartial
and Judicious <hi>Mezeray</hi> gives
<hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Eleventh</hi> upon his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
upon the Throne, That
he was the greatest Enemy to
his own and his Kingdoms Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et;
one that lov'd his own <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
Fancies</hi> more than the
<hi>wise Laws,</hi> and thought the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103977:68"/>
greatest <hi>Grandeur</hi> consisted in the
greatest <hi>Oppression,</hi> pulling down
<hi>great ones</hi> to raise up the <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
from nothing. This, he says,
another calls putting their Kings
<hi>Hors de Paye;</hi> that is, out of
their <hi>Minority;</hi> he should have
said, putting them out of their
<hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No question the Ministers were
ready to welcome him to that
which they call'd the <hi>Exercise</hi> of
his Power, when it was rather to
the <hi>Execution</hi> of theirs.</p>
            <p>The first practice of it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the <hi>Great Seal</hi> from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Ely</hi> (as if remembring his
former Carriages), and gave it to
<hi>Wickham,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester;</hi>
and displac'd many others; as if
by that he seem'd to take Seizin
of his new Power; suspending al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<hi>Glocester</hi> and <hi>Warwick</hi> from the
<hi>Privy-Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:103977:69"/>
The Tide now turn'd to the
<hi>King,</hi> who began to return to
follow those <hi>Advices</hi> that had
brought him to so much <hi>hazard</hi>
before; And that Interest and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
which the <hi>French</hi> had
work'd themselves into, appear'd
in all things to increase. The
Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and the Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had formerly
temper'd the <hi>King</hi> with their
calm and sure Reasons; when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enrag'd against the <hi>Lords,</hi> he
swore he wou'd more willingly
submit and rely on the Protection
of <hi>France,</hi> than thus to be made
servile to those he ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>'Tis
not unworthy of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
how frequently the
<hi>French</hi> have been prevalent in
<hi>England;</hi> and always in such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Times as have given so much
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103977:69"/>
Power to <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Favourites,</hi>
as made them considerable enough
to be corrupted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> says, That in
his Time all the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s
Ministers, and great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
had Pensions from <hi>France,</hi>
and gave their Acquittances up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every Receipt, which were
to be seen in the Chamber of
<hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hastings,</hi> the Lord great <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain,</hi>
was the only great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that was hardly perswaded to
become a Pensioner of <hi>France,</hi>
and that refus'd to give any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance
for what he receiv'd.
The same <hi>Historian</hi> says, That he
was the only man that perswaded
him to it, and had first perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to be so to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke
of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> and when <hi>Cleret</hi>
was sent by King <hi>Lewis,</hi> with a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103977:70"/>
Present of 2000 Crowns, and
desired his Acquittance for his
Discharge, as he had receiv'd it
from the <hi>Chancellor</hi> and the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral:</hi>
He answer'd, the Gift pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from his Master's Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
not his Request: If he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
he shou'd receive it, he might
put it in his Sleeve; other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonial
he shou'd get none of
him; for he wou'd not that any
shou'd say, That the <hi>Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi>
was <hi>Pensioner</hi> to the <hi>French
King,</hi> nor that his Acquittance
shou'd be found in the <hi>Chamber</hi>
of <hi>Accounts.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi>
was angry with <hi>Cleret</hi> for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no <hi>Acquittance;</hi> but ever
after preferr'd the Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain
in his Esteem before all
the King of <hi>England</hi>'s other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p>I
cannot discern much Reason
for it; There seems little Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103977:70"/>
to me between one that is
carelesly, and another that is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
dishonest: And those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
equally forgot the <hi>Interest</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> for their own, to let
them share in our Affairs and
Councils. The People judg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
right in this, and Parliaments (as
<hi>Cemines</hi> observes) were never
corrupted in themselves and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and alway<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> perceiv'd the
Dissimulation of the <hi>French;</hi> and
in another place says, they were
always willing to grant Aids a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>France;</hi> for they cou'd not
be deceiv'd by Demonstration:
which shew'd the Difference in
our Methods and Constitution
from theirs: Our <hi>Laws</hi> are suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to our <hi>Interest,</hi> and our <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi>
secur'd by our <hi>Laws:</hi> Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions
and manner of Expences,
shou'd be applicable to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of our own Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The <hi>French</hi> differ from the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103977:71"/>
first; and their Fancies are the
only Measures of the last: They
are not capable to live after the
Methods of our Interest, but we
may quit ours to assist theirs:
<hi>France</hi> can be but of little use to
us, but we may be of too much to
them: They may receive, but can
bring no advantage. They have
reason then to be always <hi>active,</hi>
to keep an <hi>Interest</hi> here by private
means, since 'twere vain to hope
it by publick ones; and <hi>Gardinal
Richelieu</hi> well understood these
Truths, when he call'd <hi>England</hi>
their <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Guido</hi> Earl of
St. <hi>Paul</hi> was sent by <hi>Charles</hi> the
<hi>French King,</hi> to visit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
<hi>King Richard</hi> and his
<hi>Queen.</hi> The Earl, according to
the ready Confidence of the
<hi>French,</hi> became <hi>Counsellor:</hi> For
one day the King discoursing with
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103977:71"/>
him, he complain'd of the Duke
of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and in particular,
that he did passionately endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to disturb the Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> The
Earl presently gave Seutence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Duke, and told the
King plainly, he was not fit to
live: For when a Subject was
grown so great, a Prince was
no longer safe; and if he meant
to secure himself against Danger,
the surest way was to destroy those
from whence it might so easily
come.</p>
            <p>This Advice blew the <hi>King's</hi>
Anger into a Flame; and he
began to express to some of his
great men, his Displeasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Duke of <hi>Glocester;</hi>
but he found in them all an
high Opinion of the Duke's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Vertue: So that the
King began to calm again, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103977:72"/>
shew'd as if Cruelty had not its
full spring from his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but swell'd as it was nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd
by the Streams of other
Councils.</p>
            <p>For after this he was again
rais'd by the Advices of the
Earls of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
to contrive the Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Duke of <hi>Glocester:</hi>
And commonly as the Advice
of ill men tends to the worst
things, so generally they sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
the worst way of doing
them.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> was
then at his House in <hi>Plashy</hi> in
<hi>Essex,</hi> whither the King was
invited, or rather invited him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and with all Testimonies
of Respect and Kindness most
splendidly feasted. This was
judg'd a proper time for the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103977:72"/>
Design; and as the Duke wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the <hi>King,</hi> to bring him
going, he was seiz'd by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of arm'd men laid secretly
for him, and so hurried blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
to the <hi>Thames,</hi> and in a
Vessel ready prepar'd, carried
to <hi>Calice,</hi> and there shortly
after strangled: Either thought
too Guilty and Popular, or not
Guilty enough to be brought
to a publick Tryal. And as the
wicked Advisers perswaded his
taking by the breach of <hi>Hospitality</hi>
(the basest way of Treachery), so
they continued in the peculiar
Methods of Mischief, to contrive
his Death by the most hated way
of private Murther.</p>
            <p>Within a Day or two after,
the King invited the Earl of
<hi>Warwick</hi> to Dinner, and in the
midst of all shews of Kindness,
sent him to Prison, and also the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103977:73"/>
Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> and his Son.
The Dukes of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and
<hi>York</hi> being thus alarm'd, gather'd
Forces together; but upon the
Promise of a Parliament, and
Legal Proceedings, with many
Excuses for what had been done,
they dismiss'd their Forces, and
came up to attend at Parliament;
where Sir <hi>John Bushy,</hi> Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Bagott,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Green,</hi>
appear'd busie Ministers for the
King: Sir—<hi>Bushy</hi> was made
<hi>Speaker,</hi> and by his and their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduous
Endeavours, corrupting
some by Fears, and others by
Benefits, the Charters of Pardon,
formerly granted by the King,
were annull'd and made void.
The <hi>Prelates</hi> perceiving what
way was made for taking away
of Lives, constituted Sir <hi>Henry
Percy</hi> their Procurator, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
themselves, that they
might not be present at any
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103977:73"/>
Sentence of Blood; a President
ever to be remembred for the
Honour of their Calling.</p>
            <p>Then follow'd, as was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
the Death of the Earl of
<hi>Arundel,</hi> the perpetual Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi>
in the <hi>Isle of Man,</hi> the Death of
the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> (above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd),
the Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> arraign'd for Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Commission against <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
Delapoole,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
banished into the <hi>Isle of
Wight,</hi> Sir <hi>Reginald Cobham</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
to Death for being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
appointed by the Lords in
the King's Minority, to be one of
his Governours.</p>
            <p>These Cruel Successes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
Arguments to those new
Upstart Ministers, <hi>Bushy, Bagott,</hi>
and <hi>Green,</hi> to infuse into the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103977:74"/>
King how much more safe he
was by Cruelty than gentle
means, and how much more
secure by Fear than Love. Nor
are other Counsels to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from such Men, equally
low and mean in their Minds,
as in their Extractions, made
greedy from their Poverty, and
ambitious from their Meanness;
neither endued with their Minds
and Fortunes to think of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
Power was their Justice,
Violence their Prudence, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
the Providence.</p>
            <p>The King was now possess'd
with the Opinion, That he
was in a Condition to dispose,
as he pleas'd, of those that
durst dislike his Actions, and
that his <hi>Will</hi> might now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the <hi>Law.</hi> But the present
Prospect of Things commonly
deceives those that are willing
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103977:74"/>
onely to believe the Whisper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of their own Inclinations;
and because they see nothing at
the present spring up, they
forget that the Roots grow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discern'd.
And no Questio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>,
the King in that Conjuncture of
Time, thought every Cloud
dispers'd, and pursued all those
fatal ways that mistaken Flattery
cou'd guide him in.</p>
            <p>But a particular Accident made
way for a general and fatal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution.
The Duke of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
one day discoursing with the
Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> complain'd how
much the King was misguided by
mean and base Counsellors, such
as fought their own private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
and not the publick Good;
and fear'd that the <hi>King,</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such Councels, would so lose
the Hearts of his People, that it
might prove dangerous to him:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103977:75"/>
Assuring him, that no private dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
urg'd him to say this,
but meerly his love to his <hi>King</hi>
and <hi>Country;</hi> and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
the Duke, being one of the
<hi>King's</hi> Cabinet-Council, to lay
these things before him, which
might prove of ill Consequence if
continued. The Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi>
seemed not to dislike what
had been said, but so represented
it to the King, that he turn'd it
rather to an Accusation, than a
Counsel: The King, that could
not endure to hear unpleasant
Truths, and at that Instant look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon himself as above the
mean Consideration of publick
Notions, so resented the boldness
of the Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> that he
summon'd him to answer this (that
now became his Charge) before
the Council, where the Duke
confirmed his Information, which
was deny'd by the Duke of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford,</hi>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:103977:75"/>
owning all that he had
said; but the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>
maintaining the Accusation, the
Combat was demanded, and assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to, and the day appointed by
the <hi>King:</hi> At which time both
the Dukes appear'd arm'd, and
being just ready to be engag'd,
they were stopt by the <hi>King,</hi>
and Banishment pronounced
against both the Dukes: The
Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> dyed sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
after at <hi>Venice,</hi> having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
no great Benefit by those
<hi>Violences</hi> he so precipitately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in.</p>
            <p>A little after dyed <hi>John</hi> of
of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> Father to the Duke of
<hi>Hereford,</hi> and fourth Son of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Third; after whose
death the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Lancaster</hi> fell
to this Dukes being his eldest Son.
But the <hi>King</hi> in his deceiv'd opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Security,</hi> acted
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103977:76"/>
the most probale means to shake
both; seizing all the Duke's
New-descended Estate into his
own hands, and endeavour'd to
make his Banishment perpetual:
Revoking all his <hi>Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,</hi>
to prevent the suing out
the <hi>Livery</hi> for those Lands du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Banishment.</p>
            <p>If this be well consider'd, 'tis
impossible a <hi>King</hi> should do it
purely from his own advice:
First, he enrag'd a Person that
could only be a considerable
Enemy; his Popularity gave him
an Interest in Power, and his
<hi>Descent</hi> from a <hi>King,</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to use it. This could be no
Motive from <hi>right Reason</hi> to urge
the King to do such an imprudent
<hi>Injustice;</hi> he was above the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
of a private Estate, but
his Ministers were tempted by it,
following the usual Methods of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103977:76"/>
their Counsels, by no Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
but <hi>Revenge</hi> and <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;</hi>
as if their Safeties were
grounded upon nothing so much
as their <hi>Princes</hi> Hazard, and
their Advantages upon his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
            <p>As
the Testimony of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency
of these Counsellors,
the <hi>King</hi> left all the Business to
them, and gave himself up
wholly to Sloth and Pleasure;
The imitation spread into <hi>Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
and <hi>Effeminacy,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi>
thought it was the Testimony of
<hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> to live uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to such a loose Condition; all
Power, but this shadow of it,
was exercis'd by his Ministers,
who now depress'd all Persons of
either <hi>Courage</hi> or <hi>Honour.</hi> A Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
Man was counted dangerous,
and a Wise Man Mutinous; and
every one was made perceive, that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103977:77"/>
'twas easier to prosper by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>Princes Humour,</hi> than
to pursue his <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The
Ministers being grown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Absolute power,</hi> thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but how to satisfie their
greedy <hi>Ambitions:</hi> They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to get all for the <hi>King,</hi>
the sure way to convey it to
themselves. And indeed his
<hi>Gifts</hi> were so large to them,
that they brought him into more
wants, than ever the <hi>Wars</hi> of
his brave <hi>Ancestors</hi> could reduce
them to; and us'd more unjust
<hi>Inventions</hi> to supply his private
use, than they needed publick
Assistances to support the <hi>Interest</hi>
and <hi>Honour</hi> of it. But <hi>Edward</hi>
the First and <hi>Edward</hi> the Third
had a less Burthen, and Charge
to support: They had a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and no Favourites; the first
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103977:77"/>
was not capable to satisfie the
latter. For at this time, without
any publick occasion, strange
ways were us'd to levy Money;
sometimes <hi>Pole-money</hi> was exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of every <hi>Religious Person,</hi>
and <hi>Secular Priest:</hi> sometimes sums
were drawn from the People
under the name of <hi>Benevolence;</hi>
sometimes Money borrow'd by
<hi>Privy Seals.</hi> Then <hi>Commissioners</hi>
sent to all <hi>Sheriffs</hi> and <hi>Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
declaring the <hi>King's High
Displeasure</hi> for the kindness they
testified to the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi>
the Earls of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick;</hi>
and for this affection
shew'd to the <hi>King's</hi> Enemies,
his Pardon was to be obtain'd
by heavy Fines, or rather Taxes
laid upon them. The <hi>Commons</hi>
were bound by new-invented
<hi>Oaths,</hi> to perform what they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
to, and <hi>black Charters</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:103977:78"/>
Sealed and Deliver'd to the
<hi>King's</hi> use, whereby their <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
might be as well taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
as their <hi>Properties</hi> had
been.</p>
            <p>By such <hi>Counsels</hi> as these the
<hi>Subjects</hi> were turn'd to <hi>Slaves,</hi>
and made waiters upon any Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
to shake off their
<hi>Fetters:</hi> The <hi>King</hi> made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he govern'd most, when
he had none to Govern: For
<hi>Slaves</hi> are not in the Business of
Mankind; their Thoughts are
fix'd upon <hi>Revenge</hi> and <hi>Freedom,</hi>
and like distemper'd Men, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
return to their former <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The
first occasion that prov'd
this true, was a Rebellion that
broke out in <hi>Ireland;</hi> the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of which <hi>Diversion</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:103977:78"/>
favour'd the Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>
to gather Forces in the
<hi>North.</hi> And others of the <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
and <hi>People,</hi> weary of their <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,</hi>
resolv'd in the King's
absence to attempt some relief;
and fixt upon the Duke of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford,</hi>
as the proper Instrument
to act by: His Banishment, that
the <hi>King</hi> design'd to make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual,
was the Cause of that
mischief, which he believ'd he
should prevent by it. He now
became the Center, to which
all other <hi>Discontents</hi> tended; to
whom now resorted many of
his former Friends, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
whom <hi>Oppression</hi> now made
so.</p>
            <p>Among these the Archbishop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was the Chief;
who in Speech to the Duke of
<hi>Hereford</hi> laid open their <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:103977:79"/>
and <hi>Desires,</hi> summing
up all the <hi>Mischiefs</hi> and <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes</hi>
of an unsteady <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
the <hi>Contempt</hi> it spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and <hi>Oppression</hi> at home;
not Slaves to their <hi>Prince,</hi> but to
his <hi>Favourites;</hi> and that <hi>Peace</hi>
under their Extortions was
more chargeable than <hi>War:</hi> The
Expence of their <hi>Riots</hi> and
<hi>Ambitions</hi> needed more Projects
and Taxes to maintain them,
than the Defence and Support of
the <hi>Government</hi> it self requir'd:
By their <hi>Cruelties</hi> most of the
<hi>Nobility</hi> were destroyed, and the
<hi>Commonalty</hi> wasted; concluding
with imploring the Duke to
pity the Oppression of his
<hi>Countrey,</hi> and to animate those
that were ready to redeem
themselves from <hi>Slavery,</hi> by his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and Conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:103977:79"/>
The Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not the force of Eloquence
to perswade him; the loss of
his Uncles, his Banishment, the
Imprisonment of his Children,
and the loss of his Estate, were
powerful Exciters enough to lay
hold on any Opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
all his Wrongs: To all
which was added the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Temptation of a Crown;
and sure there could be no
more powerful Motives, than
by one way at once to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
both his Ambition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
            <p>These
<hi>Considerations,</hi> and the
depending on the Peoples <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
to a Change (being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with Oppression) made him
venture to land with a very
small Force in <hi>Yorkshire.</hi> At first
he gave out, That he came only
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103977:80"/>
to recover his Inheritance, and
quickly found his utmost Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
answer'd; for his small
Troop presently encreas'd to an
Army. Many of the Nobility
that came in to him, took an Oath
of him, That no bodily harm
should be done to King <hi>Richard;</hi>
as if a Conquest and a Crown
wou'd preserve that Sincerity that
was inconsistent with it; or that
the Modesty profess'd, when
something was to be obtain'd,
should continue after the <hi>Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The
Duke finding every thing
more successful than almost he
could hope, pursued that Fortune
which so prosperously invited
him, and hasted with his still-encreasing
Forces to <hi>London,</hi> where
he found a Reception suitable to
usual Joy, that discontented Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103977:80"/>
shew in Alterations. He was
receiv'd in Triumph without Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
and with all the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Zeal and Duty which
flattering Crowds cou'd pay their
lawful <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Soveraign;</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants
and rich Presents enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
him; and all the fulsome
Praises that could be invented,
and as many contumelious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
on their <hi>King:</hi> All <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies</hi>
of <hi>Allegiance</hi> seem'd lost;
the modest Mask was now taken
off, and War proclaim'd against
King <hi>Richard</hi> and his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>York</hi> in the mean
time tried to raise Forces; but
found a general Resolution in
all People, not to be Enemies to
the Duke of <hi>Lancaster.</hi> The
<hi>Favourites,</hi> that were active and
bold in Prosperity, shew'd that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103977:81"/>
neither their Skill nor their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
was to struggle with Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties;
nor had they either In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
or Reputation, if they had
attempted it: They were always
dead Weights upon their <hi>Prince,</hi>
and, like the nature of it, hung
heaviest upon weak <hi>Conditions.
Bushy</hi> and <hi>Greene</hi> were pursued
to <hi>Bristol,</hi> and there taken;
fatal place to hasty <hi>Favourites</hi>
They were eagerly pursu'd by
the flattering Fury of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and perhaps there were
some among them, that before,
in the Prosperity of these <hi>Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi>
made as passionate Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of a contrary Devotion.
<hi>Bagott</hi> escap'd into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
sav'd himself from the present
Execution. The Lord <hi>Scroop,</hi>
Lord Treasurer, with <hi>Bushy</hi> and
<hi>Greene</hi> that were taken, lost their
Heads.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:103977:81"/>
These sudden Executions were
but the usual Consequences of
violent Changes: All new-got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<hi>Power</hi> is commonly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to be preserv'd by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
and the Execution of
the Unfortunate, is call'd a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>
            <p>King
<hi>Richard</hi> was at this time
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the news came
to him of the Duke's landing in
<hi>England,</hi> and his successful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
The news increas'd
by coming, and every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
grew enlarg'd; so that it
appear'd the blackest and most
portentous Storm that ever ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
in the full Sun-shine of
a <hi>Prince,</hi> which his Favourites as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
him cou'd be subject to no
Eclipse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:103977:82"/>
The contrary appear'd to this
unfortunate <hi>King,</hi> who was then
engag'd in Troubles in <hi>Ireland:</hi>
After some time, he prepar'd for
<hi>England,</hi> having first imprison'd
the Sons of the Dukes of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi>
and <hi>Glocester,</hi> in <hi>Trim</hi>-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
and took with him the
Dukes of <hi>Surrey, Aumarl,</hi> and
<hi>Exeter,</hi> and the Bishops of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Carlisle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> was
sent before to raise an Army,
which he did in <hi>Cornwal;</hi> but the
<hi>King</hi> failing to come within the
time he promis'd, they all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd,
went home. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
was attributed to the Counsel
of the Duke of <hi>Aumarl,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
had more mind to see things
determin'd by the Fortune of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103977:82"/>
others, than by hazarding his
own.</p>
            <p>After this, the <hi>King</hi> Lands
in <hi>Wales,</hi> where he found the
stream turning from him, and
every Place of strength submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the Duke of <hi>Lancaster.</hi>
He knew not what Course to
steer, but wandred to <hi>Conway</hi>-Castle,
where the Earl of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
Steward to the <hi>King</hi>'s
Houshold, (as if finding a fitting
time to remember the proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
his Brother, the Duke of
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> Traytor) broke
his Staff of Office openly in
the Hall, before the <hi>King</hi>'s
Servants; and with Advice to
them to be as base as himself,
went avowedly to the Duke:
The rest followed his Example
and those that seem'd the most
eagerly Loyal, became now the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103977:83"/>
most violently Rebellious. And
'tis improbable that those, who
with unlimited Flattery for their
<hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
their <hi>Prince</hi> into the
dangerous Attempt of <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Power,</hi> should in any turn
of Fortune, or shock of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
retain any limited Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
The true <hi>Interest</hi> of a <hi>Prince,</hi>
retains the <hi>Interest</hi> of others;
but the <hi>Interest</hi> of private <hi>Men,</hi>
excludes the <hi>Prince</hi>'s. We have
heard, 'tis true, of some that have
been successful in such unjust and
dangerous <hi>Attempts;</hi> but the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi>
have been very few, that
have not been fatal at last; and
there are so many of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that the <hi>Comparison</hi> would
convince any, That the just <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits</hi>
within a <hi>Nation's Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
are much more safe, as well as
glorious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:103977:83"/>
King <hi>Richard</hi> had now cause to
make such sad Reflections, and by
the <hi>want of Power</hi> instructed to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the <hi>attempting of too much:</hi>
He saw himself <hi>forsaken</hi> by those
whom he should have <hi>forsook</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
He now felt severely the
want of that <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi>
that he had destroy'd; and seem'd
not <hi>forsaken</hi> of his <hi>People,</hi> but to
have <hi>forsook</hi> them before; He had
forc'd them all to be in the nature
of <hi>Traytors,</hi> and compell'd them to
<hi>purchase,</hi> as it were, the name of
<hi>Subjects,</hi> while there were none that
seem'd so to him, but those that
needed <hi>Pardon</hi> the most, such as had
counsell'd him to the <hi>Ruin</hi> that now
fell upon him.</p>
            <p>He had been so long accustomed
to follow the <hi>Counsel</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> that
he knew not now the way to use
his <hi>own:</hi> He had too long fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the mean and easie ways of
<hi>Indirectness.</hi> Virtuous and steddy
Actions in the undisturbed part of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103977:84"/>
Life, give power in <hi>Extremity;</hi>
and the memory of what was <hi>Great</hi>
and <hi>Good,</hi> gives boldness to such a
Mind to claim <hi>Success</hi> in the <hi>worst
condition:</hi> But the memory of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries</hi>
and <hi>Injustice</hi> done to others,
shakes <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Expectations</hi>
in a dangerous Estate. This he
shewed, by <hi>discharging</hi> his <hi>Army,</hi>
rather than bravely using them;
as if he believ'd it impossible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<hi>Power</hi> now, since he had used
it so ill before.</p>
            <p>The next thing that seem'd best,
was to have <hi>retired</hi> till a <hi>better oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion</hi>
was offered; for nothing is
more <hi>various</hi> or <hi>violent,</hi> than the
stream of Mens minds, with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
affecting <hi>Change,</hi> and hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Expectations</hi> (that are seldom
answered) to be eas'd from all <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Grievances</hi> and <hi>Oppressions;</hi> and
every one that assisted in the <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
looks upon himself as a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Object</hi> of <hi>Reward;</hi> never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,
that <hi>new-gotten Power</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:103977:84"/>
needs more to secure it, than the
<hi>Ease</hi> of <hi>People</hi> will allow; and when
deceiv'd in that, they begin to stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and at last grow to repent the
<hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> the <hi>expenceful
Change</hi> had cost, and ready upon
any occasion to revenge their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
Errours. And perhaps King
<hi>Richard</hi> might have <hi>hop'd</hi> as much
in some time, as the Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi>
then <hi>found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there were some who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
had before appear'd most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently
<hi>Loyal,</hi> who now advis'd
their <hi>still-abused King</hi> to the <hi>last</hi>
and <hi>worst way,</hi> and sacrific'd <hi>Him</hi>
for <hi>their own Peace;</hi> telling, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
That <hi>unfortunate Princes</hi> sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
found <hi>Protection</hi> abroad, but
were kept only as a <hi>Composition</hi> with
their <hi>successful Enemies.</hi> And tho
he had so near <hi>Relation</hi> to the King
of <hi>France,</hi> yet <hi>Ties</hi> by <hi>Marriage</hi>
were no Obstacle to their <hi>Vse</hi> of
<hi>Interest,</hi> but rather a Shelter for
the more <hi>unsuspected Designs.</hi> And
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103977:85"/>
he would accordingly find, that
he would be the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>new
Alliances,</hi> and then 'twould be too
late to expect such Conditions
from the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> which
probably he might not hope for.</p>
            <p>These <hi>false Reasons</hi> were perhaps
used to him by such as could not
at a less rate reconcile themselves
to the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> than by
betraying their <hi>Master</hi> into his
hands; for nothing could be more
<hi>improbable,</hi> than that he who <hi>had the
Power,</hi> should by <hi>Conditions</hi> preserve
him who <hi>had a Right to it,</hi> while nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was capable to trust the others
Mercy: Yet this <hi>vain Counsel</hi> was
followed; and, as if to improve it
by <hi>Intelligence</hi> with the Duke of
<hi>Lancaster,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>
was sent to the King, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
him, that the <hi>Duke</hi> would pay
him all <hi>humble Obedience,</hi> and only
desir'd a <hi>Parliament</hi> should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at <hi>Westminster,</hi> to settle the <hi>sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Affairs</hi> of the <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:103977:85"/>
The <hi>King</hi> must then perceive
how he was forsaken by those who
before had so much flatter'd him
with their <hi>excessive Love</hi> and <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty:</hi>
and it seem'd a just instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to suspect the <hi>violent Professions</hi>
of any that have no restraint by
<hi>Principles</hi> in a <hi>fortunate Condition:</hi>
They that want <hi>Virtue,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
<hi>Love,</hi> should rather cause <hi>suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi>
than <hi>belief;</hi> especially when
'tis addressed where <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi>
may invite it: But the Love
of <hi>absolute Greatness</hi> in <hi>Opinion,</hi> more
than <hi>real</hi> and <hi>true Greatness</hi> in it
self, has hindred <hi>Princes</hi> from see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Defects</hi> and <hi>Designs</hi> of <hi>mean</hi>
and <hi>interrupted Flatterers;</hi> such as
believe their <hi>Prince</hi> has never <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
enough, unless it appears by the
<hi>Oppression</hi> of others, and (like these
in this unhappy <hi>King</hi>'s time) fall
from their <hi>Professions,</hi> as he decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in <hi>Power:</hi> But I have read of
some (tho but a <hi>few</hi>) who govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves by <hi>Principles</hi> in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103977:86"/>
their <hi>Prince's Prosperity,</hi> and guided
by the same <hi>Virtue,</hi> have not forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
him in <hi>Adversity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> in some measure yet
made a <hi>right Reflection</hi> on his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;</hi>
for he thought 'twas in
vain to hope that the <hi>Conqueror</hi>
would restore him the <hi>Power</hi> he had
gotten, and therefore only to the
Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> proposed
for himself a <hi>retir'd</hi> and <hi>quiet Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
But he was as much mistaken
to <hi>hope that,</hi> as he guessed right to
<hi>expect the other.</hi> But when the
<hi>Duke</hi> met the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Flint-Castle,</hi>
he seem'd to pay him all Reverence
due to a <hi>King;</hi> and told him, <hi>He
only acted what he had done for the
recovery of his Estate and Possessions.</hi>
But this was only that <hi>false Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
that <hi>ill men</hi> use in <hi>obtaining,</hi>
and seldom perform when they
have <hi>obtained;</hi> for such <hi>Modesty</hi> is
laid aside by <hi>Success,</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi>
grown useless, when <hi>Power</hi> is fully
possessed; for presently after the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103977:86"/>
               <hi>King</hi> was secured, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of a <hi>Prisoner</hi> carried to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
yet in <hi>His Name</hi> a <hi>Parliament</hi>
was presently called.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> now found the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Truth, <hi>That usually mens Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
are but the product of their
present Conditions, not of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions;
and perhaps in a low estate
they may wish and desire within mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
limits: but the violence of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming
Power breaking over the
former bounds, overthrow all mean
and level thoughts.</hi> Perhaps the <hi>King</hi>
might now make such severe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections</hi>
on his <hi>past Actions,</hi> seldom
regarding his <hi>Professions</hi> when he
had <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Opportunity</hi> to violate
them; he could not but be prest
with the memory of his <hi>unhospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Treachery</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
and the Earl of <hi>Warwick;</hi>
and must with detestation remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
those Counsellors of <hi>Falseness</hi>
and <hi>Indirectness,</hi> which once <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd</hi>
his <hi>Happiness,</hi> and now <hi>ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated</hi>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:103977:87"/>
his <hi>Misery.</hi> He now saw
their <hi>violent</hi> and <hi>loyal flatteries</hi>
were meant for <hi>their own Interest,</hi>
not for <hi>His;</hi> and that such <hi>mean
things,</hi> like other <hi>Insects,</hi> live with
a little Warmth, but shrink at any
Change of Weather.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>York,</hi> that was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with the <hi>Government,</hi> during
King <hi>Richard</hi>'s absence in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
was become the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi>'s
chief <hi>Adviser</hi> of the Methods he
was now to take, which was as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
as his fogotten Duty requir'd
to make his <hi>new Loyalty</hi> acceptable.
In the first place, he advis'd, That
King <hi>Richard</hi> should be pressed to
a voluntary <hi>Resignation,</hi> and also
to be solemnly Depos'd. This Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
was pursued, and the King
seem'd as ready to yield to it, as the
<hi>Duke</hi> ambitiously desired it: The
form of the <hi>Resignation</hi> was then
contriv'd to be performed the day
before the <hi>Parliament</hi> was to meet,
and yet that <hi>Parliament</hi> was to sit,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103977:87"/>
tho the <hi>King</hi> was to be no longer a
<hi>King,</hi> in whose name it was called;
and certainly, if there could be no
Virtue in the <hi>Resignation,</hi> the
<hi>Dissolution</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi> must
have been the Consequence; for
that which was call'd by a <hi>Power,</hi>
could not continue when there was
a <hi>Demise</hi> of that <hi>Power;</hi> but no <hi>Plot</hi>
was to be seen or hit. The hasty
and flattering <hi>Zeal,</hi> that was to be
shown to the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi>
pursued it's violent Course through
all the <hi>Obstacles</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Justice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among those that were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission'd
to receive his <hi>Resignation,</hi>
there were <hi>Lords, Clergy-men,</hi> and
<hi>Lawyers;</hi> the two Chief Justices,
<hi>Thormins</hi> and <hi>Markham,</hi> were in the
number: And in the Reigns of
these two unfortunate <hi>Princes,</hi>
there wanted not <hi>Temporal</hi> and
<hi>Spiritual Gown-men,</hi> that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to all their <hi>Errors</hi> in their
unfortunate <hi>Conditions;</hi> and on
their Adversities, transplanted their
<hi>Zeals</hi> into <hi>Sunshine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:103977:88"/>
These <hi>Commissioners</hi> being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
Assembled in the <hi>Tower;</hi>
King <hi>Richard</hi> was brought out in
all the <hi>Kingly Ornaments,</hi> that he
might have some <hi>Ensigns</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> to
resign formally; in this <hi>Condition</hi> he
was placed in a <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and in
this moment of his <hi>Royalty</hi> appear'd
a <hi>King;</hi> all that was now done,
was certainly from himself, and
shew'd in this <hi>Extremity,</hi> virtue
enough to make it evident, He
might have been an excellent
<hi>Prince,</hi> had his <hi>Ministers</hi> not Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more than he; for he shew'd
no <hi>Disorder</hi> to this great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presidented
Action of his <hi>Life;</hi>
he neither seem'd to force a <hi>Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi>
to endure, nor affect a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
to submit. But as both had
naturally sprung from the choice
of a retired <hi>Condition,</hi> with this
<hi>Calmness</hi> in all this <hi>Storm</hi> of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi>
he spoke to the <hi>Commissioners,</hi>
beginning with their acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those <hi>Errors,</hi> that his <hi>Youth</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:103977:88"/>
made ill <hi>Councellors</hi> capable to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
in him; and seem'd only
troubled, that he had not time
allowed to repair those <hi>Injuries</hi> he
had done the <hi>Nation;</hi> knowing
now from a clear sight, that he
was both willing and capable to
have performed so happyan Action.
He now perceiv'd his own <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi>
when the <hi>Vices</hi> of others
could no longer hide them. And
he that could have once been so
easily perswaded, that he was shot
at through his wounded <hi>Ministers;</hi>
now saw that 'twas from them he
receiv'd his <hi>Wounds;</hi> he neither
accused any, nor complained of
any, nor valuing a <hi>Narrative</hi> and
<hi>Empty Satisfaction;</hi> but concluded
with the choice of losing a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
rather than engage it in
<hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Confusion</hi> for his <hi>Sake;</hi>
desiring only to enjoy that <hi>Peace</hi>
which he merited for <hi>Reserving</hi> it
for others; and was as willing to
resign his <hi>Title</hi> to the Duke of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103977:89"/>
               <hi>Lancaster,</hi> as he perceiv'd they
were willing to receive it from
him.</p>
            <p>After this, he read the <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
that was prepar'd; and made
two <hi>Bishops</hi> his <hi>Attorneys,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that his <hi>Resignation</hi> in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
which was done the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
after, and accepted of by the
<hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> was <hi>Legal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
but yet this was not thought
enough, but a heavy <hi>Charge</hi> in
many <hi>Articles</hi> was exhibited against
him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Articles</hi> were too far from
my purpose, and too long to set
down; but whoever reads them in
the <hi>Rolls,</hi> will find them of much
weight, and as shrewdly compos'd,
as the Nature of the thing could
either bear or require; there was
not an <hi>Injustice</hi> or <hi>Error</hi> omitted;
the chiefest things contained were
those <hi>Actions</hi> by which his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites</hi>
thought to secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
by subjecting all <hi>Judges</hi> and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103977:89"/>
               <hi>Sheriffs</hi> to his <hi>Will,</hi> thereby to
bring within his <hi>Power, Parliaments</hi>
and <hi>Law,</hi> and make way to <hi>Levy
Taxes</hi> as he pleased; and it was a
particular <hi>Article,</hi> That he should
say and declare, That all <hi>Law</hi> lay
in his <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Breast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the <hi>Extremities</hi> that
proceed from the <hi>Counsels</hi> of such
<hi>Men,</hi> who have made themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
to <hi>Share</hi> or <hi>Trust</hi> in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good;</hi> who knowing how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
they could expect from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted
<hi>Methods</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> and
<hi>Justice,</hi> seek to preserve themselves
by the <hi>Destruction</hi> of that which
threatned them. And 'twere
impossible that <hi>Princes</hi> should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
their <hi>own</hi> in the desperate
<hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> were they not
first blinded from discerning the
<hi>Ambition</hi> of those that hide it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the fierce <hi>Zeal</hi> for their <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Articles</hi> (which were 29.)
were owned by the <hi>Lords</hi> and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103977:90"/>
               <hi>Commons</hi> to be so notorious, that
they needed no further <hi>Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or <hi>Proof.</hi> And joined with
the <hi>Consent</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> on whom
they were charged; It was judged
sufficient for <hi>Deposing</hi> King <hi>Richard,</hi>
and <hi>Establishing</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi>
by the Name of <hi>Henry the
fourth;</hi> adding also a <hi>far-fetch'd
Title</hi> from <hi>Henry</hi> III. to patch up
the <hi>seeming Justice</hi> of such an <hi>Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Title</hi> was drawn from <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi>
sirnamed <hi>Crookback,</hi> eldest
Son of <hi>Henry</hi> III. and that for his
Deformity he was put by the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
and given to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
I. and the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi>
was next of Blood by the Mothers
side to this <hi>Edmund.</hi> But this <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi>
was third Son of <hi>Henry,</hi> and
not deformed at all, but a brave
Man in Person and Mind; but the
next Heir then to the Crown was
<hi>Edmund</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> Son to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
who was a little before slain in
<hi>Ireland;</hi> who seeing the Stream so
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:103977:90"/>
violent against King <hi>Richard,</hi> wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
retir'd, and liv'd with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
<hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Pruduce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was a <hi>Title</hi> invented, to
support that <hi>Power,</hi> which the
<hi>Sword</hi> had obtain'd: And the <hi>King,</hi>
who by the <hi>Law</hi> is said to do no
wrong, is charg'd with <hi>Articles</hi> for
doing all. Thus when <hi>Ballances</hi>
are once hoisted, like <hi>Childrens</hi> play
at <hi>Weighing,</hi> the same <hi>Weight</hi> tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
one another, that would of
themselves hang equally; nor is
there any <hi>Judicature</hi> to compose
such violent <hi>Disorders</hi> in a <hi>State;</hi>
for <hi>Success</hi> will be the <hi>Judg,</hi> and
always gives worst <hi>Judgment.</hi> And
the <hi>Professors</hi> of the <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Laws,</hi> have been commonly
zealously ready to find wrested
<hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Divine Necessity</hi> to ratify
the <hi>Success</hi> of the <hi>Ambitious.</hi> On
the other side, when <hi>Princes</hi> by
false <hi>Professions, abuse</hi> the <hi>Good,</hi> and
increase in <hi>Power</hi> enough to <hi>encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi>

they press to run at <hi>Head,</hi> and lead
the <hi>Cry</hi> that's made by slower
paced, and more temperate <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
till at last, <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Necessity</hi>
brings most to make up the <hi>Noise;</hi>
or by <hi>Silence,</hi> not to interrupt it;
so that a general <hi>Consent</hi> seems to
contribute to the designed <hi>Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:</hi>
And the naming a <hi>Right</hi> to
<hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> becomes an
<hi>Intention</hi> of <hi>Rebellion.</hi> The <hi>Prince</hi>'s
<hi>Will</hi> must then be the <hi>Law,</hi> and his
<hi>Religion</hi> the <hi>Devotion</hi> of all <hi>Loyal
Subjects;</hi> then those that have least
<hi>Principles,</hi> declare for the greatest
<hi>Loyalty;</hi> and by their <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi>
pursue their <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Ambition.</hi>
And the search for <hi>Absolute Power,</hi>
is made by secret <hi>Reserves,</hi> publick
and false <hi>Professions, Corrupting</hi>
some, and <hi>Terrifying</hi> others, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi>
many; and upon specious
<hi>Pretences</hi> displacing such as appear
either suspecting the <hi>Designs,</hi> or not
as passionate as the rest in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them. Yet, when the <hi>Power</hi>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:103977:92"/>
is promoted and secur'd, as the <hi>King</hi>
was told his was, when all <hi>Subjects</hi>
lost their <hi>Names,</hi> and like <hi>guilty
Slaves,</hi> signed <hi>Blanks,</hi> as the <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
of it. Then appears what <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel</hi>
describes in those times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Romans;</hi> When <hi>absolute
Power</hi> was <hi>exercised; Riches</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
especially, <hi>Virtue,</hi> grew to be
<hi>Capital Offences; Informers</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniators</hi>
rewarded, <hi>Servants</hi> insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
against their <hi>Masters, Children</hi>
against their <hi>Parents, guilty Men</hi> the
<hi>Accusers;</hi> and those few that were so
unhappy to have no <hi>Enemies,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
by their <hi>Friends.</hi> And all
<hi>dissembled Cruelties</hi> and <hi>Oppressions,</hi>
break forth into <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>bare-faced
Practice.</hi> That which before
was declared to be the <hi>Government,</hi>
must then be call'd the <hi>support</hi> of
it. Ill <hi>Designs</hi> grow by <hi>Degrees,</hi> but
when their <hi>cherish'd Roots</hi> have took
a deep and firm <hi>hold,</hi> they are then
declared by the <hi>mischievous Fruit</hi>
they put forth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:103977:93"/>
               <hi>Modesty</hi> seldom stays with full
grown <hi>Power;</hi> and the former
<hi>Reputation</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> is useless to
them. In such a <hi>Change</hi> they
must purchase <hi>new Characters,</hi> from
<hi>new Violences,</hi> to <hi>merit Trust</hi> or
<hi>Safety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> having now (as far
as he could) resign'd his <hi>Sovereign
Power,</hi> began to find how much
he was mistaken with the hopes
of enjoying that retir'd Peace,
which he seem'd willing to change
his <hi>Crown</hi> for; <hi>Fortune</hi> commonly
makes haste in the <hi>Prosperity</hi> or <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity</hi>
of <hi>Princes;</hi> and there is a
<hi>reasonable Cause</hi> why neither should
be <hi>slow;</hi> for the base <hi>Minds</hi> of <hi>Men</hi>
hurry them to <hi>assist</hi> the <hi>Successful,</hi>
and help to <hi>destroy</hi> the <hi>Vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;</hi>
led always more by <hi>Fear</hi>
and <hi>Interest,</hi> than <hi>Resolution</hi> and
<hi>Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Truth</hi> appear'd in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
of this unhappy <hi>King;</hi> whose
<hi>Title</hi> that was left him, was first
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103977:93"/>
shar'd by his <hi>Enemies,</hi> and he then
convey'd from the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi>
to <hi>Leeds Castle</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and from
thence to <hi>Pomfret Castle</hi> in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire;</hi>
for some little time there
seem'd to be paid him some small
<hi>Respects</hi> in the manner of his <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance,</hi>
but that was but the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Treatinf</hi> of the <hi>Shadow</hi> of a
<hi>King,</hi> which yet probably made him
uneasy who enjoyed the <hi>Substantial
Power:</hi> For it is <hi>reported</hi> by some,
That King <hi>Henry</hi> should one day
with a deep <hi>Sigh Deplore</hi> and
<hi>Lament,</hi> That neither he nor the
<hi>Nation,</hi> had a <hi>Friend</hi> that would
pull up that <hi>Root</hi> from which
<hi>Disquiets</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> could only
<hi>Spring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis probable that the Bishop of
<hi>Carlisle</hi>'s <hi>Oration,</hi> arguing at that
time against the <hi>Right</hi> of King <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>'s
being depos'd, and the <hi>Right</hi> of
<hi>Henry</hi> to succeed to the <hi>Crown,</hi> and
some <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>Risings</hi> that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
happen'd, might perhaps
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103977:94"/>
hasten the taking away the <hi>unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Prince</hi> from all his <hi>Miseries;</hi>
but whether the <hi>King</hi> gave particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Orders</hi> or <hi>Encouragement</hi> by such
<hi>words,</hi> is uncertain; but there never
wanted <hi>Men</hi> barbarous enough to
offer <hi>cruel Sacrifices</hi> to <hi>bloody Power;</hi>
and for the hopes of <hi>Favour</hi> and
<hi>Reward,</hi> rather <hi>guess</hi> what <hi>Mischief</hi>
would be acceptable, than stay to
be instructed, that their <hi>Merits</hi>
might seem to be enlarged by their
readiness in <hi>Villany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of these <hi>Causes</hi> made Sir
<hi>Peirce Exton,</hi> with eight other <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains</hi>
hasten to <hi>Pomfret,</hi> as if he
feared he should be depriv'd of the
<hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Action;</hi> when he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd,
the <hi>Preface</hi> to the intended
<hi>Cruelty,</hi> was the forbearance of that
<hi>Ceremony</hi> of <hi>Tasting,</hi> that was usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
paid King <hi>Richard,</hi> as he sat at
<hi>Dinner;</hi> who demanded the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
of it. He that used to perform
it, answer'd, That Sir <hi>Peirce Exton</hi>
had brought such <hi>Orders</hi> from
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103977:94"/>
King <hi>Henry;</hi> at which the <hi>King</hi>
seem'd so much <hi>transported,</hi> that
he <hi>Struck</hi> at him, and call'd him
<hi>Huzzy</hi> of <hi>Lancaster;</hi> at which time
Sir <hi>Peirce Exton</hi> with his <hi>bloody
Followers</hi> entred, and shut the <hi>Door</hi>
after him, which being perceiv'd
by the <hi>King,</hi> he verily guessed their
fatal <hi>Intentions;</hi> and seeming less
surprized in this great and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Danger,</hi> than in all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
tho lesser <hi>Hazards;</hi> he readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and boldly snatched a <hi>Halbert,</hi>
and with a <hi>Resolution</hi> differing
from his former <hi>Actions, Slew</hi>
four of the <hi>Assassinates,</hi> and with
continued <hi>Bravery</hi> fought with the
rest, till the chief Villain <hi>Exton</hi>
got upon a <hi>Chair</hi> behind him, and
with a <hi>Pole-Ax</hi> struck him down,
where the <hi>unfortunate King</hi> ended
all his <hi>Calamities,</hi> and left the
<hi>Murderer</hi> to endure future <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
For when he returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
expecting great <hi>Preferments</hi>
and <hi>Rewards,</hi> he found himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103977:95"/>
not only in the hopes of
an <hi>Addition</hi> of <hi>Favour,</hi> but in the
<hi>Loss</hi> of what he had; not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that, tho a <hi>Man</hi> might be
<hi>Ill</hi> enough to wish a <hi>Mischief,</hi> he
hardly could be so confidently
<hi>Bad,</hi> as publickly to <hi>Reward</hi> the
<hi>Doer</hi> of it; that <hi>counterfeit Piece</hi>
of <hi>Justice</hi> was probably shewed by
the <hi>King,</hi> to seem (at least) to
hate what he wish't, by <hi>Discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing</hi>
the <hi>Actor</hi> of the <hi>Ill,</hi> who
now began by <hi>Discontent</hi> to make
way for a punishing <hi>Conscience,</hi>
which continued him in <hi>Torments</hi>
during his short and miserable
<hi>Life,</hi> and left an <hi>Infamy</hi> to outlive
him.</p>
            <p>It is observable, that in the
two greatest <hi>Exigencies</hi> of this
<hi>Prince</hi>'s <hi>Life,</hi> he appear'd differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from himself; one in <hi>Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of his <hi>Crown;</hi> the other in the
<hi>Loss</hi> of his <hi>Life;</hi> the first he did
with a steady <hi>Calmness,</hi> almost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the <hi>Temper</hi> of a <hi>Man;</hi> the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103977:95"/>
last with a <hi>Courage</hi> equal to the
<hi>Bravest;</hi> in smaller <hi>Concerns</hi> he
seem'd <hi>unsteady</hi> and <hi>amaz'd;</hi> in these
great ones <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>unconcern'd;</hi> but
in these <hi>Extremities</hi> he was not
cloy'd with those <hi>Favourites</hi> and
<hi>Ministers</hi> that <hi>influenc'd</hi> him with
their <hi>Weakness,</hi> and <hi>shook</hi> his <hi>Mind</hi>
with their <hi>Indirectness,</hi> making not
only their <hi>Cause</hi> to be his, but his
<hi>Nature</hi> theirs.</p>
            <p>This seem'd justified by his <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour</hi>
in these last and greatest
<hi>Extremities;</hi> when acting wholly
from himself, he intitled himself at
last to his <hi>Father</hi>'s and <hi>Grandfather</hi>'s
(the <hi>Black Prince</hi>'s) <hi>Courage</hi> and
<hi>Virtue;</hi> and shew'd himself <hi>Dying,</hi>
what they never gave him leave

<hi>temperate;</hi> Their <hi>Promises</hi> were <hi>no
Security,</hi> and <hi>Dissimulation</hi> was their
<hi>Policy:</hi> So that from <hi>such Methods</hi>
of <hi>Government</hi> the <hi>Nation</hi> could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
no <hi>Success</hi> or <hi>Happiness.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> I. and <hi>Edward</hi> III. grew
<hi>fierce</hi> by <hi>Opposition,</hi> and <hi>gentle</hi> by
<hi>Submission;</hi> They seldom denied
<hi>Pardon</hi> to those that implor'd it,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103977:97"/>
nor suffer'd any <hi>abused Mercy</hi> unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged;
They were <hi>Mighty</hi> enough
to <hi>conquer</hi> Enemies, and <hi>Powerful</hi>
enough to <hi>forgive</hi> those they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd;</hi>
They were equally <hi>Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
both to <hi>Themselves</hi> and <hi>Others;</hi>
and those that <hi>submitted</hi> proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
more fortunate than those
that <hi>resisted</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> II. were <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive</hi>
when <hi>oppos'd,</hi> and <hi>fierce</hi>
when <hi>submitted to;</hi> They always
abus'd the <hi>Tenderness</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> and
seldom shew'd any of <hi>their own;</hi>
never <hi>forgiving,</hi> where they had
opportunity to <hi>punish;</hi> They nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had <hi>Power</hi> nor <hi>Design</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
<hi>Enemies,</hi> but used <hi>both</hi> to
overcome their <hi>Friends; Others</hi>
were <hi>Masters</hi> of <hi>Them,</hi> not <hi>They</hi> of
<hi>Themselves,</hi> and they that <hi>resisted</hi>
were always more fortunate than
they that <hi>submitted.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> I. and <hi>Edward</hi> III. in
their greatest <hi>Hazards</hi> required
none to attempt more than they
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103977:98"/>
did in their own Persons; and in
the greatest <hi>Prosperity</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi>
they prescrib'd no more <hi>Virtue</hi> and
<hi>Temperance</hi> than they gave <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> II. in <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
depended on others to attempt
for them, and in <hi>Prosperity</hi> they
gave no <hi>Rules of Virtue,</hi> but suffer'd
the <hi>Vices</hi> of others to be their <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi>

               <hi>Edward</hi>
I. and <hi>Edward</hi> III. knew
how to <hi>gain Power,</hi> and how to <hi>use</hi>
it; They made the <hi>best Laws,</hi> that
might have attempted the easiest
to <hi>break</hi> them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> II. knew lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
how to <hi>get Power,</hi> and less how
to <hi>use</hi> it. <hi>Chance</hi> sometimes <hi>brought</hi>
it, and their <hi>giddy Favourites lost</hi>
it. They never seem'd inclin'd to
make <hi>good Laws,</hi> and were always
contriving to violate those that
were made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edw</hi> I. and <hi>Edw.</hi> III. knew how

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103977:98"/>
               <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> they rais'd in
their Subjects hearts; the <hi>first</hi> they
<hi>requited,</hi> and never <hi>abused</hi> the <hi>last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> II. shew'd
little skill how to <hi>gain,</hi> and as little
how to <hi>preserve;</hi> They were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
to the <hi>mistaken Policy</hi> of <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
Love,</hi> and to the <hi>Folly</hi> of
<hi>abusing Trust.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> I. and <hi>Edward</hi> III. had
great <hi>Taxes</hi> and <hi>Supplies,</hi> which in
<hi>themselves</hi> might appear very large,
but would not seem so vast, when
compar'd with their <hi>Victories.</hi> The
<hi>Conquest of Wales, Scotland,</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> will not seem such <hi>light
Victories</hi> to be obtain'd with <hi>small
Assistance;</hi> but what the Nation
gave was <hi>justly bestowed</hi> for what
it was given, and <hi>faithfully laid out</hi>
for their <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Interest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> II. had <hi>great
Supplies,</hi> but made no Purchase
with them of <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Interest:</hi>
What others bestowed for the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Glory,</hi> they gave away to their
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103977:99"/>
               <hi>private Favourites,</hi> and wanted
more to supply their <hi>Avarice</hi> and
<hi>Ambitions,</hi> than the others did to
enlarge the <hi>Nations Glory:</hi> The <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Conquests</hi> the <hi>Favourites</hi> made
over <hi>these Princes,</hi> were more
chargeable than the <hi>Victories</hi> the
others obtain'd over <hi>Nations.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> I. and <hi>Edward</hi> III. not
only returned <hi>Security</hi> and <hi>Benefit</hi>
for their <hi>Subjects Gifts,</hi> by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests</hi>
Abroad, but by <hi>excellent
Laws</hi> at Home: What <hi>Edward</hi> I.
began well, <hi>Edward</hi> III. gave per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to; nor were these <hi>brave
Princes</hi> more <hi>just</hi> in making <hi>good
Laws,</hi> than <hi>severe</hi> in the <hi>due execution</hi>
of them; and never shewed so much
severity, as against those that abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the <hi>Trust of Justice;</hi> as if they
were more offended at the <hi>Enemies
of Mankind,</hi> than at <hi>their own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> II. returned
<hi>nothing</hi> to their Subjects for what
they gave, neither by the <hi>Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
of <hi>Arms</hi> to <hi>crush</hi> the <hi>Greatness</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:103977:99"/>
of their <hi>Enemies,</hi> nor by the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
of <hi>good Laws,</hi> to increase the
<hi>Prosperity</hi> of the <hi>People;</hi> They
seem'd not fitted in <hi>Themselves</hi> to
attempt the <hi>first,</hi> and too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc'd
by <hi>Favourites</hi> to incline
to the <hi>last;</hi> They feared the <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of their <hi>Subjects,</hi> more than
their <hi>Enemies;</hi> and shewed they
would rather have Conquer'd at
<hi>Home</hi> than <hi>Abroad;</hi> as if they
would choose to make <hi>their own
People</hi> Slaves, rather than <hi>Others.</hi>
They apprehended the <hi>Effect</hi> of
<hi>good Laws,</hi> and were most pleased
with those that <hi>debauch'd</hi> the <hi>Trust
of Justice;</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> esteemed
most <hi>Loyal,</hi> that were readily
<hi>wicked;</hi> those were the <hi>greatest Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,</hi>
that the People most <hi>hated,</hi>
&amp; the <hi>greatest Enemies to Men</hi> were
reputed the <hi>best Friends to them.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> I. and <hi>Edward</hi> III. ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>their Interests</hi> with <hi>their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>
and never refused to hear the
<hi>Wrongs</hi> of those that assisted them
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103977:100"/>
to revenge their <hi>Injuries</hi> on others. They
were <hi>equally Valiant,</hi> and <hi>equally Successful,</hi>
and both died uncheck'd by <hi>Fortune;</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Edward</hi> I. <hi>dy'd himself</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> III.
<hi>outliv'd himself:</hi> But the <hi>Death</hi> of his
<hi>glorious Son</hi> the <hi>Black Prince,</hi> join'd with
the weight of <hi>Old Age,</hi> might justly make
that <hi>Sun</hi> set <hi>clouded.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> II. divided <hi>their
Interests</hi> from <hi>their Subjects;</hi> and their
complaint of <hi>Grievances</hi> rather procur'd
<hi>Punishment</hi> than <hi>Redress.</hi> They thought
<hi>their Peoples Good</hi> was <hi>inconsistent</hi> with <hi>their
Power;</hi> and to be <hi>sensible</hi> of <hi>Oppression,</hi> was
<hi>Rebellious.</hi> They were <hi>alike</hi> in their <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi>
and <hi>equally Successful;</hi> and in the

both alike <hi>forsaken</hi> by <hi>Her</hi> But <hi>Richard</hi> II.
in the last <hi>wretched Scene</hi> of his Life had
the opportunity of shewing <hi>some Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
that he sprung from the <hi>Black Prince,</hi>
and had not <hi>liv'd</hi> more <hi>unhappily</hi> than he
<hi>dy'd bravely:</hi> The <hi>First</hi> he ow'd to his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,</hi>
