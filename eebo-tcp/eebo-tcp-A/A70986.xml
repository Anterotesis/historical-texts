            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:50733:3"/>
ſeveral Hiſtories might be compiled: I may compare it to Gold, that in a ſmall quantity is of more worth than a great deal of baſe Coin, for it comprehends much Matter in a few Words. And for the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commendation, it bears in the Frontiſpiece the Name of that ever Famous Antiquary, Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> who was never wont to treaſure up any thing but what was Rare; nor can I certainly ſay, whether it were Pen'd by Himſelf or not. I inſiſt the more upon Him, becauſe it was my chance to be one whom he vouchſafed to take by the Hand a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death, I being ſent to him by my Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie Seal, to acquaint him that by my Lords Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the King was Reconciled to him: but his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, That his Heart was broken, and that it was now too late: Whereby it appears that Princes are ſometimes abuſed, and miſ-informed, to the Ruine of the beſt Men. Sir <hi>Walter Rawleighs</hi> unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate end proves the ſame, who was circumvented by the cunning Practiſes of Earl <hi>Gondamor,</hi> whereby to the unſpeakable detriment of Poſterity, he was prevented from ſetting forth the Second Part to compleate the Worlds Hiſtory, which he had made ready for the Preſs. <hi>Gondamor</hi> is yet freſh in Memory of many Men, who knew him when he lay Leiger here from the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and I never

heard or read of any Embaſſadour that acted his part with more dexterity for his Maſters glory and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage than he did, for however he had to deal with a very wiſe Prince (as he ſayes) yet like another <hi>Mercury</hi> he could ſoon with his facetious words and geſtures pipe King <hi>James</hi> a ſleep, and did ſometimes take hold of the Helm himſelf, and was very near to have run the Ship a ground, or to have ſplit her upon the Rocks, the influence of his ill Aſpect, and Eclipſing the Sun-beams is hardly over unto this preſent Age. <hi>Don Caro Columbus</hi> who was ſent hither, was thought by many judicious Men, to be the more Prudent, and that <hi>Gondamor</hi> was but a Buffon compared with him: yet when he departed, he was fain to leave this Motto behind him, <hi>Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> emplying, That he had not accompliſhed what he came about: but <hi>Gondamor</hi> put a Period to what he had Deſigned; and perhaps it had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for our Nation if that Politick <hi>Spaniard</hi> had never tr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Is Catholick Majeſty had given Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that preſently upon the return of <hi>Signior Gondamor,</hi> his Leiger Embaſſadour from <hi>England,</hi> (1618.) a ſpecial Meeting of all the principal States of <hi>Spain,</hi> (who were of his Council) together with the Preſidents of the Council of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> of the <hi>Indies,</hi> of the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> and eſpecially of the holy <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> ſhould be held at <hi>Mouſon</hi> in <hi>Aragon,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:50733:5"/>
being appointed Preſident, who ſhould make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his Maſters pleaſure, take account of the Embaſſadours ſervice, and conſult touching the State and Religion reſpectively, to give ſatisfaction to his Holineſs <hi>Nuncio,</hi> who was deſired to make one in this Aſſembly, concerning certain Overtures of Peace and Amity with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and other Catholick Projects which might engender ſuſpition and jealouſie betwixt the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Majeſty, if the miſtery were not unfolded and the ground of theſe Counſels diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered afore-hand.</p>
            <p>This made all men expect the Embaſſadors return, with a kind of longing that they might behold the iſſue of this meeting, and ſee what good for the Catholick cauſe the Embaſſadours employment had effected in <hi>England,</hi> anſwerable to the general opinion conceaved of his wiſdome, and what further project would be ſet on foot to become matter for publick diſcourſe; At length he arrived and had preſent notice given him from his Majeſty, that before he came to the Court he ſhould give up his account to this Aſſembly, which Command he gladly received as an earneſt of his acceptable ſervice, and gave thanks that for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor he might publiſh himſelf in ſo judicious a preſence; he came firſt on the day appointed to the Council Chamber, (except the Secretaries) not long after all the Council of State and their Preſidents met, there wanted only the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> and the <hi>Popes Nuncio,</hi> who were the head and feet of all the Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Theſe two ſtayed long away for divers reſpects, the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> that he might expreſs the greatneſs of his Maſter, and loſe the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> no reſpect by his over-ſight, but that the Benches might be full to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

him at his approach. The Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> to expreſs the authority and dignity of his own perſon, and to ſhew how a ſervant put in place of his Maſter, exacts more duty of his fellow ſervants then the Maſter himſelf; theſe two ſtayed till all the reſt were weary of waiting, but at length the <hi>Nuncio</hi> ſuppoſing all the Council ſet, lanched forth and came to road in the Council chamber, where after mutual diſcharge of duty from the Company, and bleſſing upon it from him, he ſate down in ſollemn ſilence grieving at his over-ſight, when he ſaw the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> abſent, with whom he ſtrove as a Competitor for pompe and glory.</p>
            <p>The Duke had ſent before, and underſtood of the <hi>Nuncio's</hi> being there, and ſtayed ſomething the longer that his boldneſs might be obſerved, wherein he had his deſire, for the <hi>Nuncio</hi> having a while patiently dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away the time with ſeveral complements, to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons, had now almoſt run his Court-ſhip out of breath, but that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Villa Hermoſa,</hi> Preſident of the Council of <hi>Aragon,</hi> fed his humour by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his own diſcontentment, upon occaſion of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerma</hi> his abſence, and beckned <hi>Signior Gondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> to him, uſing this ſpeech in the hea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Your Excellency knoweth, the eſtate is happy where wiſe Favourites govern Kings, if the Kings themſelves be fooliſh, or where wiſe Kings are, who having Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, either fooliſh, or the wiſer ſort, will not yet be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by them. The State of <hi>England</hi> (howſoever you hear of it in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi>) is too happy in the laſt kind, they need not care what the Favourite be, though for the moſt part he prevent all kind of ſuſpition in that kind, being choſen rather as a Schollar to be taught<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and trained up, then as a Tutor to teach: Of this they are ſure no Prince exceeds theirs in perſonal abilities; ſo that nothing could be added to him in my wiſh, but this one, that he were our vaſſal and a Catholick. With that the noiſe without gave notice of the Duke of <hi>Ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's</hi> entrance, at whoſe firſt approach the whole houſe aroſe, though ſome later then other, as envy had hung Plummets on them to keep them down; the <hi>Nuncio</hi> only ſate unmoved, the Duke cheriſhed the obſervance of the reſt with a familiar kind of carriage, too high for curteſie as not neglecting their demeanors, but expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and after a filial obeyſance to the <hi>Pope</hi> his <hi>Nuncio,</hi> ſate down as Preſident under the cloth of Eſtate, but ſomewhat lower, then after a ſpace given for admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, preparation, and attention, he began to ſpeak in this manner.</p>
            <p>The King my Maſter (holding it more honor to do, then to diſcourſe, to take from you the expectation of Oratory, uſed rather in Pulpits and Schools then in Councils,) hath appointed me Preſident in this holy, wiſe, learned, and noble aſſembly, a man naturally of a

ſlow ſpeech, and not deſirous to quicken it, by Art or Induſtry; as holding action only proper to a <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> as I am by birth, to a Souldier as I am by profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to a King, as I am by repreſentation; take this therefore briefly, for declaration both of the cauſe of this meeting, and my Maſter his further pleaſure.</p>
            <p>There hath been in all times ſince the worlds foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, one chief Commander or Monarch upon the earth, this needs no further proof then a back looking into our own memories and Hiſtories of the world; neither now is there any queſtion (except with Infidels and Hereticks,) of their own chief Commander in Spirituals, in the unity of whoſe perſon, the members of the viſible Church are included. But there is ſome doubt of the chief Commander in Temporals, who as the Moon to the Sun might govern by night, as this by day, and by the Sword of Juſtice, compel to come in, or cut off, ſuch as infringe the authority of the Keys: This hath been ſo well underſtood long ſince by the infallible Chair, as that thereby upon the declenſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and the increaſe of <hi>Romes</hi> Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſplendor, (who thought it unnatural that their Sun ſhould be ſublunary) our Nation was by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſelected before other People, to conquer &amp; rule the Nations with a rod of Iron. And our <hi>King</hi> to that end adorned with the Title of Catholick King, as a name above all names under the Sun (which is) under Gods Vicar General himſelf, the Catholick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of ſouls; to inſtance this point by compariſon; look firſt upon the grand <hi>Signior,</hi> the great <hi>Turk,</hi> who hath a large Title but not univerſal, for beſides that he is an Infidel, his command is confined within his own Territories, and he ſtiled not Emperour of the World,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50733:7"/>
but of the <hi>Turk</hi> and their Vaſſals only. Amongſt Chriſtians, the Defender of the Faith, was a glorious Stile, whilſt the King, to whom it was given by his Holineſs, continued worthy of it, but he ſtood not in the Truth, neither yet thoſe that ſucceed him, &amp; beſide it was no great thing to be called, what every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought to be, Defender of the Faith, no more then to be ſtiled with <hi>France,</hi> the moſt Chriſtian King, wherein he hath the greateſt part of his Title common with moſt Chriſtians; the Emperour of <hi>Rome, Russia, Germany,</hi> extend not their limits further than their ſtiles which are local, only my Maſter the moſt Catholick King, is for dominion of bodies, as the univerſal Biſhop for dominion of ſouls, over that part of the World which we call <hi>America</hi> (except where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders uſurp) and the greateſt part of <hi>Europe,</hi> with ſome part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> by actual poſſeſſion, and over all the reſt by real and indubitable right, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth this right to be derived from the free and Fatherly donation of his Holineſs, who as the Sun to the Moon lends luſtre by reflection to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to this King, to this King of Kings my Maſter, what therefore he hath howſoever gotten, he may keep and hold, what he can get from any other King, or Commander, by any Stratagem of War, or pretence of Peace, he may take, for it is theirs only by uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, except they held of him from whom all civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is derived, as eccleſiaſtical, from his Holineſs; what the Ignorant call Treaſon, if it be on his behalf is truth, and what they call Truth, if it be againſt him is Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and thus all our Peace or War, our Treatiſes, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and whatſoever intendment elſe of ours, aims at this principal end, to get the whole poſſeſſion of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50733:7"/>
World, and to reduce all to unity under one temporal Head, that our King may truly be what he is ſtiled, the Catholick &amp; Univerſal King; as Faith is therefore uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, &amp; the Church is univerſal, yet ſo as it is under one Head the <hi>Pope,</hi> whoſe ſeat is and muſt neceſſarily be at <hi>Rome,</hi> where Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſate; So muſt all men be Subject to our and their Catholick King, whoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſeat is here in <hi>Spaine,</hi> his univerſal every where. This point of State, or rather of Faith, we ſee the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <hi>Roman</hi> Religion hath taught every where, and almoſt made natural; ſo that by a Key of Gold, by intelligence, or by way of confeſſion, my Maſter is able to unlock the ſecrets of every Prince, and to withdraw their ſubjects allegiance, as if they knew themſelves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Maſter his ſubjects in truth, then theirs, whom their birth hath taught to miſcal Soveraign; we ſee this in <hi>France,</hi> &amp; in <hi>England</hi> eſpecially, where at once they learn both to obey the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to acknowledg the catholick King as their Father, &amp; to hate their own King as an Heretick and an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; ſo we ſee Religion, and the State are coupled together; laugh and weep, flouriſh, and fade, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of eithers fortune growing upon one ſtock of Pollicy: I ſpeak this the more boldly here in this preſence, becauſe I ſpeak here before none but Natives, perſons who are partakers both in themſelves &amp; iſſues, of theſe Triumphs of antient <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore ſuch as beſides their oaths it concerns to be ſecret; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need we reſtrain this freedome of ſpeech from the <hi>Nuncio</hi> his preſence, becauſe beſides that, he is a <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> by birth, he is a Jeſſuit by profeſſion and order, deviſed by the providence of Gods Vicar, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh this Monarchy the better, all of them being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proriate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50733:8"/>
thereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as publick Agents, and privy Counſellors to this end, whereas the wiſdome of this ſtate is to be beheld with admiration, that in temporal Wars, it imployes, or at leaſt truſts none but Natives; ſo in <hi>Caſtile, Portugal,</hi> or <hi>Aragon</hi>: ſo in Spirituals, it imployes none but the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and ſo imployes them that they be generally reputed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how remote ſoever they be from us, how much ſoever obliged to others, yet ſtill to be ours, and to be of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, though they be <hi>Polonians, Engliſh, French,</hi> and reſiding in theſe Countries and Courts; the penitents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and all with whom they deal and converſe in their ſpiritual traffick, muſt needs be ſo too, &amp; ſo our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King muſt needs have an inviſible Kingdome and an unknown number of ſubjects in all Dominions, who will ſhew themſelves and their Faiths, by their works of diſobedience, whenſoever we ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to uſe that <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> vertue of theirs; this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being the principal end of all our Councils, according to thoſe holy directions of our late pious King <hi>Phillip,</hi> the ſecond, to his ſon now ſurviving, to advance the Catholick <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominion together, we are now met by his Majeſties Command, to take an account of you (<hi>Signior Gondomor</hi>) who have been Embaſſadour for <hi>England,</hi> to ſee what good you have effected there, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the advancement of this work, and what further project ſhall be thought fit to be ſet on foot to this end, and this is briefly the occaſion of our meeting.</p>
            <p>Then the Embaſſdour who attended bare-headed all the time, with a low obeyſance began thus; this moſt laudable cuſtome of our Kings, in bringing all Officers to ſuch an account, where a review and notice
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50733:8"/>
is taken of good and bad ſervice upon the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Imployments, reſembles thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> Triumphs, appointed for the Souldiers, and as in them it provoked to courage, ſo in us it ſtirs up to diligence; our Maſter converſeth by his Agents with all the World, yet with none of more regard then the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> where matter of much diverſity is often preſented through the ſeveral humors of the State, and thoſe of our Religion and Faction, that no inſtruction can be ſufficient for ſuch negotiations, but much muſt be left in truſt to the diſcretion, Judgment, and diligence of the Incumbent: I ſpeak not this for my own glory, I having been reſtrained, and therefore deſerved mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but to forewarn on the behalf of others, that there may be more ſcope allowed them to deal in, as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall require. Briefly this rule delivered by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, was the Card and compaſs, by which I ſcaled to make profit of all humors, and by all means to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the State of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction together, upon all advantage either of oath or the breach of them, for this an old obſervation but a true, that for our piety to <hi>Rome,</hi> his Holineſs did not only give, but alſo bleſs us in the Conqueſt of the new World; and thus in our pious perſeverance, we hope ſtill to be Conquerors of the old. And to this end whereas his Excellency, in his excellent diſcourſe, ſeems to extend our outward Forces, &amp; private Aims, only againſt Hereticks, and reſtrain them in true amity with thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion: This I affirm ſure, becauſe there can be no ſecurity, but ſuch Princes as are now <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholicks, may turn Hereticks hereafter, my aims have ever been to make profit of all, and to make my Maſter, Maſter of all, who is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50733:9"/>
and conſtant ſon of his Mother <hi>Rome</hi>: And to this end I beheld the endeavours of our Kings of happy memory, how they have archeived Kingdomes and Conqueſts by this policy, rather then by open Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and that without difference, as well from their Allies and Kinsfolks, men of the ſame Religion and profeſſion, ſuch as were thoſe of <hi>Naples, France,</hi> and <hi>Navarr,</hi> though I do not mention <hi>Portugal</hi> now uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, and <hi>Savoy</hi> that hardly ſtept from us, as of an adverſe and Heretical Faith; Neither is this rule left off, as the preſent Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> the low Countries, <hi>Bo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>emia,</hi> now all labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for life under our plots, apparently manifeſt this way; therefore I bend my Engines in <hi>England,</hi> as your honours ſhall particularly hear; Neither ſhould I need to repeat a Catalogue of all the ſervice I have there done, becauſe this State hath been acquainted with many of them heretofore by the intercourſe ſo wrought, that the State ſhould be rather rob'd and weakned (which is our aim) then ſtrengthened, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> vainly hope; Beſides in a ſmall time, they ſhould work ſo far into the body of the State, by buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Offices, and the like, whether by Sea or Land, of Juſtice Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, in Church or State, all being for Mony expoſed to ſale, that with the help of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> they would undermine them with meer wit, without gunpowder, and leave the King but a few Subjects, whoſe Faiths he might relie upon, whilſt they were of a Faith adverſe to his, for what Catholick body that is ſound at the heart, can abide a Corrupt and Heretical head.</p>
            <p>With that the Duke of <hi>Medina dell Rio ſecco,</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of their Council of War, and one of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50733:9"/>
of State, roſe up and ſaid, his Predeceſſors had felt the Force and Wit of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Eighty eight; and he had cauſe to doubt, that the Catholicks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that were <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and not fully <hi>Jeſuited,</hi> upon any Forraign Invaſion, would rather take part with their own King, though an Heretick; than with his Catholick Majeſty, a Stranger.</p>
            <p>The Embaſſadour deſired him to be of another mind; ſince firſt, for the perſons, generally their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by long diſuſe of Arms were diſabled, and their Minds effeminated by Peace and Luxury, far from that they were in 88, when they were daily fleſh'd in our Bloud, and made hearty by cuſtomary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts: And for the affections of thoſe whom they call <hi>Recuſants,</hi> (quoth he) I know the bitterneſs of their inveterate Malice, and have ſeen ſo far into their Natures, as I dare ſay they will be for <hi>Spain</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ainſt all the World: yea (quoth he) I aſſure your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours I could not imagine ſo baſely, of their King and State as I have heard them ſpeak, nay their rage hath ſo perverted their Judgements, that what I my ſelf have ſeen and heard proceed from their King beyond admiration even to aſtoniſhment, they have ſleighted, miſreported, ſcorned and perverted to his diſgrace, and my rejoycing, magnifying in the mean time our Defects for Graces.</p>
            <p>Here the Duke <hi>Paſtrana,</hi> Preſident of the Council of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſteps up and ſaid, He had lately read a Book of one <hi>Cambdens,</hi> called his <hi>Annals,</hi> where writing of a treaty of Marriage long ſince, betwixt the <hi>Engliſh Elizabeth,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjowe</hi>; he there obſerves, that the Marriage was not ſeriouſly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on either ſide, but politickly pretended by both
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50733:10"/>
States counterchangably, that each might effect their own ends: There (quoth he) the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had the better, and I have ſome cauſe to doubt, ſince they can Diſſemble as well as we, that they may have their aims under<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hand as we have, and intend the Match as little as we do: And this (quoth he) I beleive the rather, becauſe their King as he is wiſe to conſult and conſider, ſo he is a conſtant Maſter of his Word, and hath Written and given ſtrong Reaſons againſt Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches made with Perſons of contrary Religion; which Reaſons no other man can Anſwer, and therefore doubtleſſe he will not go from, nor counſel his Son to forſake theſe Rules, laid down ſo deliberately.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency miſtakes (quoth the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor) the advantage was then on the ſide of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> becauſe the <hi>French</hi> ſought the Match; now it muſt be on ours, becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſeek it, who will grant any thing rather than break off; and beſides have no patience to temporize or diſſemble in this or any other Deſign, as the <hi>French</hi> have long ſince well obſerved; for their Neceſſities will give them neither time, nor reſt, nor hope elſewhere to be ſupplied: As for their King I cannot ſearch into his Heart, I muſt beleive others that preſume to know his Mind, hear his Words, and read his Writings, and theſe relate what I have delivered: But for the reſt of the People, as the number of thoſe that are truly Religious are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the leaſt, and for the moſt part of leaſt account, ſo it is there; where if an equal oppoſition be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their truly Religious and ours, the remainder which will be the greater number, will ſtand indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and fall to the ſtronger ſide where there is moſt hope of gain and glory, for thoſe two are the <hi>gods</hi> of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50733:10"/>
the magnitude and multitude; now theſe ſee apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no certain ſupplies of their Wants, but from us.</p>
            <p>Yes (quoth the Duke) for even now you ſaid, the general State loathing the Match, would redeem the fear thereof with half their Eſtates; it is therefore but Calling a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the buſineſs were ſoon effected.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Parliament!</hi> (ſayes the Embaſſadour) Nay, therein lies one of the chiefeſt Services I have done, in working ſuch a diſlike between the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Lower Houſe,</hi> by the endeavours of that honourable Earl, and admirable Engine, a ſure Servant to us, and the Catholick Cauſe whilſt he lived, as that the King will never endure <hi>Parliament</hi> again, but rather ſuffer abſolute Want, than receive conditional Relief from his Subjects; beſides, the Matter was ſo cunningly carried the laſt <hi>Parliament,</hi> that as in the <hi>Powder-Plot</hi> the fact effected ſhould have been imputed to the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> the gteateſt <hi>Zealots</hi> of that <hi>Calvinian</hi> Sect; ſo the <hi>Propoſitions</hi> which dam'd up the Proceedings of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> howſoever they were invented by <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholicks, and by them intended to diſturbe that <hi>Session,</hi> and yet were propounded in favour of the <hi>Puritans,</hi> as if they had been hammered in their <hi>Forge,</hi> which very <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Shadow</hi> the King hates, being a ſufficient Aſperſion to diſgrace any Perſon to ſay he is ſuch, and a ſufficient bar to ſtay any ſuit, and utterly to croſs it, to ſay it ſmells of, or enclines to that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Moreover, there are ſo many about him who blow this Coal, fireing their own Stakes; if a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> ſhould enquire into their Actions, that they uſe all their Art and Induſtry to withſtand ſuch a <hi>Council,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:50733:11"/>
perſwading the <hi>King</hi> he may <hi>Rule</hi> by his abſolute <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> without a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and thus furniſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by Marriage with us, and other Domeſtick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects without Subſidies, when Levying of Subſidies and Taxes have been the only uſe Princes have made of ſuch <hi>Aſſemblies:</hi> And whereas ſome free Minds amongſt them reſembling our Nobility, who preſerve the Priviledge of Subjects againſt Soveraign Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, call for the Courſe of the Common Law, (a Law proper to their Nation) theſe other Time-ſe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vers cry the Laws down, and up the Prerogative; whereby they prey upon the Subjects by Suits and Exactions, milk the State and keep it bare, procure themſelves much Suſpition amongſt the better and more judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e amongſt the oppreſſed <hi>Commons</hi>; and yet if there ſhould be a <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſuch a courſe is taken, as they ſhall never Chuſe their Shire Knights and Burgeſſes freely, who make the greater half of the Body thereof; for theſe being to be Elected by moſt Voices of the Free-holders in theſe Countries where ſuch Elections are to be made, are carried which way the great Perſons, who have Lands in theſe Countries, pleaſe; who by their Letters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their Tennants, Followers, and Friends, to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate ſuch as adhere to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for the moſt part are of our Faction, and reſpect their own Benefit or Grace, rather than their Countries good; yea, the Country-people themſelves, will every one ſtand by the great Man, their Lord, or Neighbour, or Maſter, without regard of his Honeſty, Wiſdom, or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that which they aim at (as I am aſſured by faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Intelligence, is to pleaſe their Landlord) and ſo to renew their Leaſe; in which regard they will
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50733:11"/>
betray their Country and Religion too, and Elect any man, that may moſt profit their particular: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is unlikely there ſhould ever be a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and impoſſible the Kings Debts ſhould be paid, his Wants ſufficiently repaired, and Himſelf left full-handed by ſuch a courſe; and indeed, as it is generally thought, by any courſe but by a Marriage with us; For which cauſe, whatſoever Project we liſt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, enter ſafely at the Door, whilſt their Policy lies aſleep, and will not ſee the Danger: I have made tryal of theſe <hi>Particulars,</hi> and find few Exceptions in this general Rule.</p>
            <p>Thereby I and their own Wants together, have kept them from Furniſhing their Navie, which being the Wall of their Iſland, and once the ſtrongeſt in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, lies now at Road, unarm'd, and fit for Ruine; If ever we doubted their Strength by Sea, now we need not; there are but few Ships or Men able to look abroad, or live in a Storm, much leſſe in a Sea Fight; this I effected by bearing them in hand, the Furniſhing of their Navie bred ſuſpition in my Maſter, and ſo would avert him from the Match, the Hope of which, rather than they would loſe, they would loſe almoſt their Hope of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All their Voyages to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> I permit rather with a colourable Reſiſtance than a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe I ſee them not helpful but hurtful to the State in general, carrying out Gold and Treaſure, bringing home Spice, Silks, Feathers, and the like Toyes, and inſenſibly waſting the Common Stock of Coin and Bullion, while it fills the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> and ſome private Purſes, who thereby are enabled to keep this diſcommodity on foot by Bribes, eſpecially ſo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50733:12"/>
many great Perſons (even States-men) being adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers and ſharers in the Gain; beſides this, waſteth their Marriners, not One of Ten returning, which I am glad to hear, for they are the Men we ſtand in fear of.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Their <hi>Weſt Indian</hi> Voyages, I withſtand them in earneſt, becauſe they begin to Inhabite there, and Fortifie themſelves, and may in time perhaps raiſe another <hi>England,</hi> to withſtand our new <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>America</hi>; as this old <hi>England</hi> oppoſeth our preſent State, and clouds the glorious extents thereof in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>: Beſides, there they trade for commodities with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out waſte of their Treaſure, and often return Gold for Knives, Glaſſes, and the like trifles, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch loſs of their Marriners, as in other places; therefore I croſſed whatſoever Intendments were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected for <hi>Virginia,</hi> or the <hi>Bermudoes,</hi> becauſe I ſee they may be hereafter really helpful unto them, as now they ſerve for Drains to unload their populous State, which elſe would over-flow its own Banks, by continuance of Peace, and turn Head upon it ſelf, or make a Body fit for any Rebellion.</p>
            <p>And ſo far I prevailed herein, as I cauſed moſt of the Recuſants, who were ſharers, to with-draw their Ventures and diſcourage the Work; ſo that beſides private Perſons unable to effect much, nothing was done by the publick Purſe: And we know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſuch Voyages and Plantations are not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected without great Means to ſuſtain great Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and with an unwearied Reſolution and Power to meet all Hazards and Diſaſters with ſtrong Helps and continual Supplies, or elſe the Undertaking prove idle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:50733:12"/>Fourthly, By this means likewiſe, I kept the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Forces from <hi>Venice,</hi> till it was almoſt too late to ſet out, and had a hope that work of ſecrecy, ſhould have broken forth to action, before thoſe could have arived to ſuccour them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I put hard for the cautionary Towns, which our late King <hi>Philip,</hi> of happy memory ſo aimed at, accounting them the Keyes of the Low Countries, that they might be delivered to his Catholick Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, as to the proper owner; and had perhaps prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that profeſt Enemy to our State and Church who dyed ſhortly after, gave Council to reſtore them to the Rebellious States, as one that knew popular Common-wealths to be better Neighbours, ſurer Friends, and leſs dangerous enemies, than Monarchs; and ſo by this practice reſcued them from my hands, and furniſhed the Exchequer from thence for that time; neither was I much grieved at this, becauſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancy they had before of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſeemed now to be cut off, and the intereſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had in them and their cauſe, to be taken away, which muſt be fully and finally effected, before we can hope either to Conquer them, or <hi>England,</hi> who holding together are too ſtrong for the World at Sea; and therefore muſt be diſunited before they can be overcome. This point of State is acknowledged by our moſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Pentioner, and ſure Friend, <hi>Mounſier Barnevel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> whoſe ſucceeding plots for this end, ſhall bear witneſs for the depth of his Judgement.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, But the laſt ſervice I did for the State, was not the leaſt, when I underwrought that admirable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, <hi>Rawleigh,</hi> and ſo was the cauſe, his voyage threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning much danger and damage to us was overthrown,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50733:13"/>
and himſelf returning in diſgrace, I purſued almoſt to death; Neither (I hope) need I ſay almoſt, if all things hit right, and all ſtrings hold; But the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of my commiſſion would not permit me longer to ſtay to follow him to execution, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the rather, that by conceſſion I might have wrung from the inconſiderate <hi>Engliſh,</hi> an acknowledgment of my Maſters right in thoſe places, puniſhing him for attempting there, though they might preſcribe for the firſt foot; And this I did to ſtop their mouths hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and becauſe I would quench the heat and valour of that Nation, that none ſhould dare hereafter to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the like, or be ſo hardy as to look out at Sea, or breath upon our coaſts; and laſtly, becauſe I would bring to an ignominious death, that old Pirate, who is one of the laſt now living, bread under that deceaſed <hi>Engliſh Virago,</hi> and by her fleſht in our blood and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: To do this I had many Agents, firſt, divers Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers who were hungry and gaped wide for <hi>Spaniſh Gold</hi>; Secondly, ſome that bare him at the heart for inveterate quarrels; Thirdly, ſome forraigners, who having in vain ſought the <hi>Elixer</hi> hitherto, hope to find it in his head; Fourthly, all men of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith, who are of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, and would have been my Blood-hounds to hunt him or any ſuch to death willingly, as perſons hating the proſperity of their Country, and the valour, worlh, and wit of their own Nation; in reſpect of us and our Catholick cauſe; Laſtly, I left behind me ſuch an inſtrument compoſed artificially, of a ſecular underſtanding, and a Religious profeſſion, as he is every way adopted to ſcrue himſelf into the Cloſet of the heart, and to work upon feminine Levity, who in that Country, have maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50733:13"/>
Spirits, to command and purſue their Plots un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death. This therefore I account as done, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it, knowing it will be very profitable to us, grateful to our Faction there, and what though it be croſs to the People, or the Clergy, we that only nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate for our gain, &amp; treat about this marriage for their own ends, can conclude or break off when we ſee our time, without reſpect of ſuch, as can neither profit us, nor hurt us; for I have certain knowledg, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons generally are ſo effeminate and cowardly, that they at their Muſters, which are ſeldome and ſlight, only for the benefit of their Muſter Maſters of a 1000 Souldiers, ſcarce a hundred dares diſcharge a Musket, and of that hundred, ſcarce one can uſe it like a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; And for their Arms they are ſo ill provided, that one Corſlet ſerveth many men, when ſuch as ſhew their Armour one day in one place, lend them to their friends in other places to ſhew, when they have uſe; And this if it be ſpied, is only puniſhed by a mulct in the purſe, which is the Officers aim, who for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, winks at the reſt, and is glad to find and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by Connivance profitable faults, that increaſe his Revenues; Thus ſtands the ſtate of that poor miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Country, which had never more people and few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er men; So that if my Maſter ſhould reſolve upon an invaſion, the time never fits as at this preſent, ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this marriage, and the diſuſe of Armes having caſt them into a dead ſleep, a ſtrong and wakning Faction being ever amongſt them ready to aſiſt us, and they being unprovided of Ships, or Arms, or hearts to fight, an univerſal diſcontentment following all men: This I have from their Muſter Maſters, and Captains, who are many of them of our Religion, or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50733:14"/>
of none, and ſo ours ready to be bought and ſold, and deſirous to be my Maſters ſervants in Fee.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the State particularly, wherein I have bent my ſelf to weaken them and ſtrengthen us, and in all theſe have advanced the Catholick cauſe, but eſpecially in procuring favours for all ſuch as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that ſide, &amp; croſſing the other by all means; And this I practice my ſelfe, and give out to be generally practiſed by others, that whatſoever ſucceſs I find, I ſtill boaſt of the victory, which I do to diſhearten the Hereticks, and to make them ſuſpitious one of another, eſpecially of their Princes beſt States-men, and to keep our own in courage, who by this means increaſe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would be in danger to decay.</p>
            <p>Now for Religion, and ſuch deſigns as fetch their pretence from thence, I beheld the policy of that late Biſhop of theirs, <hi>Bancroft,</hi> who ſtirred up and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a dangerous Schiſme, betwixt our ſecular Prieſts and Jeſuits, by which he diſcovered much weakneſs to the diſhonour of our Clergy, and prejudice of our cauſe; This taught me as it did <hi>Barnevelt</hi> in the Low Countries, to work ſecretly and inſenſibly betwixt their Conformiſts, and Non-conformiſts, and to caſt an eye as far as the Orcades, knowing that buſineſs might be ſtirred up there that might hinder proceedings in <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> ever uſed <hi>Scotland</hi> to call home the Forces of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo to prevent their Conqueſts, the effect you have partly ſeen in the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> who ſometimes was Captain for the King and Church, againſt the great Marq. <hi>Huntley,</hi> and now fights under our banner at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> leaving the Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of St. <hi>George,</hi> and St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> for the Croſs of St. <hi>James</hi>: Neither do our hopes end here, but we day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50733:14"/>
expect more Revolters, or at leaſt ſuch a diſunion as will never admit ſolid reconcilement, but will ſend ſome to us, &amp; ſome to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> for the King (a wiſe and vigilant Prince) labouring for a perfect union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both the Kingdomes which he ſees cannot be effected; where the leaſt Ceremony in Religion is continued diverſe, ſharp &amp; bitter brambles from thence ariſing, whilſt ſome ſtriving for honour more then for truth, prefers their own way and will before the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral peace of the Church, and the edification of ſouls, he I ſay ſeeks to work both Churches to uniformity, and to this end made a Journey into <hi>Scotland,</hi> but with no ſuch ſucceſs as he expected, for divers of ours at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the train, who ſtirred up humors and factions, and caſt in ſcruples and doubts to hinder and croſs the proceedings, yea thoſe that ſeem moſt adverſe to us, &amp; averſe to our opinions by their diſobedience and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, help forward our plots, and theſe are incourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a factious and heady multitude, by a faint and Irreſolute Clergy, many falſe Brethren being amongſt their Biſhops, and the prodigal Nobility, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain theſe ſtirs in the Church, &amp; that thereby they may ſafely keep their Church livings in their hands, which they have moſt Sacrilegiouſly ſeized upon in the time of the firſt Deformation, and which they fear would be recovered by the Clergy, if they could be brought to a brotherly peace and agreement, for they have ſeen the King very bountiful in this kind, having lately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their pentions, and ſetled the Clergy a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Maintenance, and beſides out of his own Means which in that Kingdome is none of the greateſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought in and reſtored whole Biſhopricks to the Church, which were before in Lay-mens hands, a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50733:15"/>
great part of the Nobilities eſtate conſiſting of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Lands, which makes them cheriſh the <hi>Puritanical</hi> Faction, who will be content to be trencher fed with Scraps and Crums, and contributions, and arbitrary benevolence, from their Lords, and Lairds, and Ladies and their adherents and followers.</p>
            <p>But (quoth the Inquiſitor General) how if this act of the Kings, wherein he is moſt earneſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, ſhould ſo far thrive, as it ſhould effect a perfect union in the Church and Common-wealth, I tell you it would in my conceit, be a great blow to us, if by a General meeting, a general peace ſhould be concluded, and all their Forces bent againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> and we ſee their politick King aims at this.</p>
            <p>True (quoth <hi>Gondamor</hi>) but he takes his mark amiſs howſoever he underſtands the People and their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation better then any man, and better knowes how to temper their paſſions and affections, for beſides that he is hindered, there in <hi>Scotland</hi> underhand, by ſome for the reaſons above recited, and by the other great ones of ours, who are in great place and authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, he is likewiſe deluded in this point, even by his own Clergy at home in <hi>England,</hi> who pretend to be moſt forward in the cauſe, for they conſidering if a general uniformity were wrought, what an Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would follow, whilſt all or moſt of theirs would flock thither for preferment, (as men preſſing towards the Sun for light and heat) and ſo their own ſhould be unprovided; theſe therefore I ſay, howſoever they bear the King fairly in hand, are under hand againſt it, and ſtand ſtiff for all Ceremonies, to be obtruded with a kind of abſolute neceſſity upon them, when the other will not be almoſt drawn to receive any, when
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50733:15"/>
if an abatement were made, doubtleſs they might be drawn to meet in the midd'ſt; but there is no hope of this with them, where neither party deals ſeriouſly, but only for the preſent to ſatisfie the King, and ſo there no fear on either ſide, that affections and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo divers, will ever be reconciled and made one, Their Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> ſtands almoſt alone in the Cauſe, and pulls upon himſelf the labour, the loſs and envy, of all with little proficiency, whilſt the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Faction have as ſure friends, &amp; good intelligence about the King, as he hath; and the ſame Poſt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that brings a packet from the King to him, brings another from their abettors to them, acquainting them with the whole proceedings and Councils, and prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them aforehand for oppoſition, this I know for truth, and this I rejoyce in as conducing much to the Catholick good.</p>
            <p>But (quoth the <hi>Nuncio</hi>) are there none of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Preachers buſie about this Match, me thinks their fingers ſhould itch to be Writing, and their tongues burn to be Prating about this Buſineſs, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Puritanical</hi> ſort, howſoever the moſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and indifferent, carry themſelves.</p>
            <p>The truth is my Lord, (quoth the Embaſſadour) that privately what they can, and publickly what they dare, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> all for the moſt part, except ſuch as be of our Faith, oppoſe this Match to the uttermoſt, by Prayers, Counſels, Speeches, &amp; Wiſhes; but if any be found longer tongued than his Fellows, we have ſtill Means to charm their ſaucineſs, and to ſilence them, to expel them the Court, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace them, and croſs their Preferments, with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of pragmatick <hi>Puritaniſm</hi>: For inſtance, I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50733:16"/>
will Relate this one particular; A <hi>Doctor</hi> of theirs, and <hi>Chapline</hi> in Ordinary to the <hi>King,</hi> gave many <hi>Reaſons,</hi> in a Letter, againſt this Marriage; and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded a <hi>Way</hi> how to ſupply the Kings Wants o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: which I underſtanding, ſo wrought under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that the <hi>Doctor</hi> was committed, and hardly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the Danger of this preſumptious <hi>Admonition</hi>; though the State knew his <hi>Intent</hi> was honeſt, and his <hi>Reaſons</hi> good: Wherein we on the other-ſide (both here, and with the arch-Duke) have had <hi>Books</hi> penn'd, and <hi>Pictures</hi> printed directly againſt their King and State, for which their Embaſſadors have ſought ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of us in vain, not being able to ſtay the Prince, or ſo much as to touch the Hem of the <hi>Authors</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But we have an evaſion which <hi>Hereticks</hi> miſs, our <hi>Clergy</hi> being freed from the <hi>Temporal Sword,</hi> and ſo not included in our <hi>Treaties</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> but at liberty to give any <hi>Heretical Prince</hi> the <hi>Mate</hi> when they liſt, whereas they are lyable to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt and hazard, and are muzled for barking, when ours may both Bark, and Bite too: The <hi>Council-Table,</hi> and the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> do ſo terrifie them as they dare not Riot, but run at the ſtirrop in excellent command, and come in at the leaſt Rebuke; they call their Preaching in many places ſtanding up, but they crowch and dare not, ſtand not up, nor Queſt, behave themſelves like Setters, ſilent, and creeping upon their Bellies, lick the duſt which our <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſhake off from their beautiful feet.</p>
            <p>Now (quoth the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi>) ſatisfie me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our own <hi>Clergy</hi> how they fare; for there were here <hi>Petitions</hi> made to the King, in the Name of the <hi>Diſtreſſed, Afflicted, Perſecuted,</hi> and <hi>Impriſoned</hi> Prieſts,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50733:16"/>
that his Majeſty would intercede for them, to free them from the intollerable burdens they groan under, and to procure their Liberties; and Letters were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected from us to this end, That you ſhould Negotiate this Demand with all ſpeed, and diligence.</p>
            <p>Moſt Excellent Prince, (replyed <hi>Gondamor</hi>) I did your Command, with a kind of Command my ſelf, not thinking it fit to make it a Suit in your Name, and my Maſters; I obtained them liberty to walk up and down, to face, and out-face their Accuſers, Judges, Magiſtrates, and Biſhops, and to exerciſe their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, almoſt as freely, altogether as ſafely as at <hi>Rome</hi>: Here the <hi>Nuncio</hi> objected, That he did not well in procuring their liberty, ſince they might do more good in Priſon, than abroad; becauſe in Priſon, they ſeemed to be under <hi>Perſecution</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo were pitied of others, and pity of the perſon prepares the affection further; beſides, then they were careful of their own Lives to give no offence, but abroad they might be ſcandalous in their Lives, as they uſe to be in <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and other Catholick Countries; and ſo the <hi>Opinion</hi> of their Holineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which upholds their <hi>Credit,</hi> and <hi>Cauſe,</hi> againſt the Married <hi>Clergy,</hi> would ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay.</p>
            <p>But the Embaſſadour Replyed, He conſidered theſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> inconveniences, and beſides a ſuperiour Command, he ſaw the profit of their liberty, more than of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; for now they might freely confer, and were ever practiſing, and would doubtleſs produce ſome work of Wonder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and beſides, the reaſon of their Authority, and Means to change places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did apply themſelves to many perſons, whereas in Priſon they could only deal with ſuch as came to be taught, were
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50733:17"/>
their own before; And this (quoth he) I added as a Secret, that as before they were maintained by private Contributions from Devout Catholicks, even to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; ſo much more now ſhall they be able to gather great Sums to weaken the State, and furniſhing them for ſome high attempt, by the example of Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> barrelling up Gold for <hi>Rome</hi>; and this they may eaſily do, ſince all Catholicks rob the <hi>Heretical Prieſts,</hi> and with-hold <hi>Tythes</hi> from them by fraud or force, to give to theſe of their own, to whom it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly due: And if this be ſpied, its an eaſie matter to lay all upon the <hi>Hollander</hi>; and ſay, He carries the Coin out of the Land (who is forward enough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in theſe practiſes) and ſo ours ſhall not only be excuſed, but a flaw made betwixt them to weaken their Amities, and beget ſuſpition betwixt them, of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Love.</p>
            <p>But amongſt all theſe <hi>Prieſts,</hi> (quoth the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi>) did you remember that old Reverend Father, <hi>Bauld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> who had a finger in that admirable attempt made on our behalf againſt the <hi>Parliament Houſe</hi>; ſuch as he, deſerving ſo highly, and ventering their Liv<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s ſo reſolutely for the Catholick Cauſe, muſt not be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, but extraordinarily Regarded, thereby to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage others to the like Holy Undertakings.</p>
            <p>Holy Father, (quoth <hi>Gondamor</hi>) My principal care was of him, whoſe Life and Liberty, when I had with much difficulty, obtained of the King, I ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly went in perſon, atended with all my Train, and divers other well-willers, to fetch him out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he was in durance: as ſoon as I came in his ſight, I behaved my ſelf after ſo lowly and humble a manner, that our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> ſtood amazed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50733:17"/>
to ſee the Reverence we give to our Ghoſtly Fathers; and this I did to confound them and their contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Clergy,</hi> and to beget an extraordinary Opinion of Holineſs in the perſon, and Piety in us; and alſo to provoke the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholicks to the like devout O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, that thereby at any time theſe Jeſuites whoſe authority was ſomewhat weakned ſince the Schiſm betwixt them and the Seculars, and the ſucceeding Powder-plot, may work them to our ends, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters their ſervants, Tutors their Schollars, Fathers their Children, Kings their Subjeſts, and that they may do this the more boldly and ſecurely, I have ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what daſh'd the authority of their high Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; upon which, whereas there are divers Purſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, men of the worſt kind, and condition, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling our Flies, and Familiars, attending upon the Holy <hi>Inquiſition</hi>; whoſe office and employment is to diſturb the Catholicks, ſearch their Houſes for <hi>Prieſts</hi> holy Veſtments, Books, Beads, Crucifixes, and the like Religious appurtenances; I have cauſed the Execution of their Offices to be ſlackened, ſo that an open way may be given to our Spiritual Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the free Exerciſe of their Faculties; and yet when theſe Purſevants were in greateſt authority, a ſmall Bribe, in the Country, would blind their eyes, or a little greater at the Court, or in the Exchequer fruſtrate and croſs all their actions, ſo that their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice went off like Squibs, making a great Crack to fright Children, and new born Babes, but hurt no old men of Catholick ſpirits; and this is the effect of all other their Courſes of proceedings in this kind, in all their judicial Courts, whither known Catholicks (Convicted, as they term them) are often ſummoned
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50733:18"/>
and cited, threatned and bound over, but the danger is paſt ſo ſoon as the Officer hath his Fee paid to him, then the Execution goeth no further; nay, upon my Conſcience, they are glad when there are Offendors in that kind, becauſe they are bountiful, and the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers do their beſt to ſuccour them, that they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and ſo their benefit and gain come in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>And if they ſhould be ſent to priſon, even that place for the moſt part is made a Sanctuary to them, as the old <hi>Romans</hi> were wont to ſhut up ſuch by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, whom they meant to preſerve from the peoples fury; ſo they live ſafe in priſon till we have time to work their liberty, and aſſure their lives, and in the mean time, their place of reſtraint is as a ſtudy unto them, where they have opportunity to confer together as in a Colledg, and to arm themſelves in unity againſt their ſingle adverſaries abroad, (but quoth the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor General) how do they for Books when they have occaſion either to write or diſpute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>My Lord replyes, <hi>Gondamor,</hi> all the Libraries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholicks, through the land, are at their Command, from whence they have all ſuch Collections as they can require, gathered to their hands, as well from thence, as from all the Libraries of both Univerſities, and even the Books themſelves if that be requiſite.</p>
            <p>Beſides I have made it a principal part of my em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, to buy all the Manuſcripts and other anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and rare Authors, out of the hands of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; So that there is no great Schollar dies in the Land, but my Agents are dealing with his Books; In ſo much as even their learned, <hi>Iſaac Cauſabons Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary</hi>

            <p>Beſides, if by any means we can continue difference in their Church, or make them wider, or beget diſtaſte betwixt their Clergy and common Lawyers, who are men of greateſt power in their Land, the benefit will be ours, the conſequence great, opening a way for us to come in between, for perſonal quarrels produce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al queſtions.</p>
