            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A BRIEFE RELATION OF THE DEATH AND sufferings of the most Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and Renowned Prelate, the Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT is a preposterous kinde of writing to beginne the story of a great mans life, at the houre of his death; a most strange way of setting forth a solemne <hi>Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> to keepe the <hi>principall Actor</hi> in the <hi>tyring-house,</hi> till the <hi>Play</hi> be done, and then to bring him on the <hi>Stage</hi> onely to speake the <hi>Epilogue,</hi> and receive the Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites. Yet this must bee the scope and method of these following papers. To write the whole life of the most Reverend and Renowned <hi>Prelate</hi> the Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> would require more time then publique expectation can endure to heare of. Those that can judge (as all wise men may) of the brightnesse and glories of the Sunne in his highest altitude by the clearenesse of his going downe;<note place="margin">Justin. hist. l. 11.</note> or that can <hi>Ortum Solis in occasu quaerere:</hi> discerne the rising of the Sunne (as once <hi>Straton</hi> did) by the reflection of his beames in a Westerne cloud: may by the glorious manner of his death and sufferings, presented in these short <hi>Remembrances,</hi> conjecture at the splendour of those rare endowments both of Grace and Nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54797:3"/>
his former life was adorned and beautifyed. The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and unsatisfied Reader, may for his farther satisfaction repaire to Master <hi>Prynn's Breviate</hi> of his life and actions, though publish'd of purpose to defame him, and render him more odious to the common people. Concerning which, the Reader may observe in breife, that all which Mr. <hi>Prynn's</hi> industrious malice hath accused him of in those Collections, is, that hee was a man of such eminent vertues, such an exemplary piety towards God, such an unwearied fidelity to his gracious Soveraigne, of such a publique soule towards Church and State; so fixt a constancy in Freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and one so little biassed by his private interesses; that this Age affords not many Equalls. And it would trouble <hi>Plutarch,</hi> (if he were alive,) to finde out a fit <hi>Parallell</hi> with whom to match him. All therefore I shall doe at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time, (and 'tis the last publique Office I shall do him) is, to lay downe the story of his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>sufferings,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a view of those <hi>plots</hi> and <hi>practises</hi> which were set on foote, to pluck a few yeares from a weake old man, and bring him to an unnaturall calamitous end. For though that <hi>maxime</hi> in <hi>Philosophy</hi> is most true and certaine; that <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptio est in instanti,</hi> that death comes to us in a <hi>moment,</hi> or <hi>in the twinkling of an eye,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15 52.</note> as the Scriptures phrase is; yet are there many <hi>previous dispositions</hi> which make way unto it; all which are comprehended in the name of <hi>death.</hi> And in that latitude of expression doe we take the word, in laying downe the story of his <hi>death</hi> before you; which being writ out of an honest zeale to truth, and a sincere affection to his name and memory, shall either bee approved of, or at least excused.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> It was the practice and position of the antient <hi>Donatists,</hi>

               <hi>Card</hi> their followers in these Kingdomes have beene <hi>steered</hi> of late, imprisoning and destroying all who have stood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. It is long since they entertained such desperate purposes against the life and person of the Lord Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, threatning his death in scattered Libels, telling him <hi>that his life was sought for,</hi> that <hi>neither God nor man could endure so vile a Counsellour to live any longer.</hi> This was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of <hi>March</hi> 1629. and was the <hi>Prologue</hi> to those <hi>libels,</hi> full of threats and scandals, which yeare by yeare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated and inflamed the people, till they had made them ripe for mischeife, and readily prepared to execute what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their grand Directours should suggest unto them. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did never fight more frequent and more terrible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats with the <hi>beasts of Ephesus,</hi> for the promotion of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, then he with these untractable and fiery spirits, who most seditiously opposed his religious purposes of setling <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and <hi>uniformity</hi> in this Church of <hi>England.</hi> And in this state things stood till the yeare, 1640. in which not onely many factious and seditious people in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> made an assault by night on his house at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> with an intent to murther him, had they found him there: but the whole faction of the <hi>Scots</hi> declared in a <hi>Remonstrance</hi> to the <hi>English</hi> Nation, that one of the cheife causes which induced them to invade this Realme, was to remove him from his Majesty, and bring him to the punishment which he had deserved. The manner of their comming hither, and the great entertainment given them by the faction here, shewed plainely that they were not like to bee sent away without their <hi>Errand</hi>: and makes it evident that his ruine was resolved on in their <hi>secret Counsells,</hi> before the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was called, or that they had declared so much by their <hi>will revealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> had not long continued, but he is named <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> for an <hi>Incendiary</hi> by the <hi>Scottish Commissioners</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon accused of Treason by the <hi>House of Commons.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54797:4"/>
no particular <hi>Charge</hi> was brought against him,<note place="margin">Decemb. 18. 1640.</note> but onely a bare promise to prepare it in convenient time; yet was he presently committed to the custody of the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Vsher,</hi> and by him kept in duresse till the end of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> (being full tenne weeks;) about which time his charge was brought unto the <hi>Lords,</hi> but in generals only, and longer time required for particular instances. And yet upon this <hi>Lydford law,</hi> by which they used to hang men first, and endite them afterwards,) was he committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> being followed almost all the way by the Rascall multitude, who barbarously pursued him with reproach and clamours to the very gates;<note place="margin">March. 1. 1640</note> and there detained, contrary to all law and justice, almost foure yeares longer. This was the first great breach which was made by <hi>Parliament</hi> in the <hi>liberties</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> Subject; (save that their like proceedings with the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> was a preparative unto it;) and was indeed the very <hi>gappe,</hi> at which the <hi>slavery</hi> and <hi>oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> under which this miserable Nation doth now pine and languish, did breake in upon them. What right could mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner persons looke for, when as so great a <hi>Peere</hi> was doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to so long imprisonment, without being called unto his Answer! What else hath filled so many <hi>Prisons</hi> in most parts of the Kingdome, with the best and wealthiest of the Subjects; but the most dangerous effects and consequences of this woful <hi>President</hi>! Which as it was the leading case unto all our pressures; so might those pressures have beene remedied, had the Subject made his Case their owne; and laboured to prevent it in convenient time. But such a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>infatuation</hi> had befallen them generally,<note place="margin">Matth. 13.14.</note> that <hi>seeing they did see, but would not perceive.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> But yet the malice of his Enemies was not so contented. For though some of the more moderate (or rather the lesse violent) <hi>Lords,</hi> who did not pierce into the depth of the designe, gave out that they intended only to remove him
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54797:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from his Majesties eare, and to deprive him of his <hi>Arch-Bishoprick,</hi> (which resolution notwithstanding being taken up before any charge was brought against him, was as unjust though not so cruell, as the others:) yet they shewed only by this <hi>Overture,</hi> that they did reckon without their hosts, and might be of the <hi>Court</hi> perchance, but not of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.</hi> The leading and predominant party thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse, then that he should escape with <hi>life,</hi> or goe off with <hi>liberty.</hi> Onely perhaps they might conceive some wicked hopes, that either the tediousnesse of his restraint, or the indignities and affronts which day by day were offer'd to him, would have broke his heart, not formerly accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the like oppressions.<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <note place="margin">Octob 26 and Novemb. 16. 1642.</note> they robbe him of his <hi>meniall</hi> servants, restraine him to two only of his number, and those not to have conference with any others, but in the presence of his <hi>Warder:</hi> and in conclusion make him a <hi>close Prisoner,</hi> not suffering him to goe out of his lodging to refresh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but in the company of his <hi>keeper.</hi>
               <note place="margin">May 9. 1643.</note> And all this while they vex his soul continually with scandalous and infamous Papers, and set up factious and seditious Preachers to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh against him in the Pulpit to his very face; so to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him to the scorne both of boyes and women,<note place="margin">As May 15. 1642.</note> who many times stood up and turned towards him, to observe his countenance, to see if any alteration did appear therein.

under pretence of maintenance for the Kings younger Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (as if His Majesties Revenues which they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded,<note place="margin">Oct 23. 16. 1.</note> were not sufficient for that purpose,) convert his House at <hi>Lambeth</hi> into a Prison, and confiscate all his coals and fewell to the use of their Gaoler;<note place="margin">Nov. 8. 1642.</note> deprive him of his right of <hi>Patronage,</hi>

            <p>And this appeares more plaine and evident, in that about <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> the comming on of the <hi>Scots,</hi> which was in the middest of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1643. they did againe revive the businesse, which had long layen <hi>dormant</hi>; causing the <hi>Articles,</hi> which they had framed in maintenance of their former <hi>Accusation,</hi> to be put in print about that time, as is apparent by the <hi>Test</hi> of <hi>Iohn Browne</hi> their Clerke, dated the 17 of that moneth.

This being obtained, the businesse was pursued with such heate and violence, that by the beginning of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> it was made ready for a sentence; which some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived would have beene given in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> and that their proofes (such as they were) being fully ripened, hee should have beene put over to a <hi>Middlesex Iury.</hi> But they were onely some poore <hi>Ignorants</hi> which conceived so of it. The leading members of the Plot thought of no such matter; and, to say truth, it did concerne them highly not to goe that way.

            <p>But yet the businesse was not done, for the <hi>Lords</hi> stucke at it.

of all power and command in their Armies.

And to effect the same with more speed and certainty, they had recourse to their old Arts, drew downe Sir <hi>David Watkins</hi> with his <hi>generall muster</hi> of subscriptions, and put a peition in his hands, to be tendred by him to the <hi>Houses,</hi> that is, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: wherein it was required amongst other things, that they would vigorously proceed unto the <hi>punishment of all Delinquents</hi>; and that for the more quick dispatch of the publick businesses of the State, the <hi>Lords</hi> would please to <hi>vote</hi> and <hi>sit</hi> together with the <hi>Commons.</hi> On such uncertaine termes, such a ticklish <hi>Tenure</hi> do they now hold their place and power in <hi>Parliament</hi>; who so efficiously complied with the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> in depriving the <hi>Bishops</hi> of their <hi>Votes,</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> birth-right. And this was it which helped them in that time of need. For by this (though stale and common) Stratagem did they prevaile so far upon some weak spirits, that the Earles of <hi>Kent, Pembroke, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi> and <hi>Bullingbrook,</hi> the Lords, <hi>North, Gray</hi> of <hi>Wark,</hi> and <hi>Brews,</hi> (a <hi>Scothman,</hi> but an <hi>English</hi> Baron, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally called the Earle of <hi>Elgin</hi>) resolved to yeild unto the current of so strong a streame: and thought they made a gaining voyage, if by delivering the Lord <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> to the peoples fury, they might preserve themselues in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples favour.

Prelate, that he gave a greater blow unto the enemies of God and the King at the houre of his death, than he had given them in his whole life before; of which I doubt not but the King and the Church will find speedy fruits.

thanke God) though the weight of the sentence lye heavie upon me, I am as quiet within, as ever I was in my life. And though I am not only the first Archbishop, but the first man that ever dyed by an <hi>Ordinance of Parliament,</hi> yet some of my Predecessors have gone this way, though not by this meanes; For <hi>Elphegus</hi> was hurried away and lost his head by the <hi>Danes;</hi> and <hi>Symon Sudbury</hi> in the fury of <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> and his fellowes; Before these, Saint <hi>Jon Baptist</hi> had his head danced off by a lewd woman; and Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> submitted his head to a persecuting Sword. Many Examples (great and good) and they teach me patience; for I hope my Cause in Heaven will looke of another dye, then the colour that is put upon it here. And some comfort it is to me, not only that I goe the way of these great men in their severall generations, but also that my Charge (as fowle as 'tis made) lookes like that of the <hi>Jewes</hi> against Saint <hi>Paul (Acts. 25.3.)</hi> For he was accused for the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Temple, i. e. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> And like that of Saint <hi>Stephen (Acts 6.14.)</hi> for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Ordinances which Moses gave, i. e.</hi> Law and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>the holy place and the Temple (verse. 13.)</hi> But you will say, doe I then compare my selfe with the integrity of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and Saint <hi>Stephen?</hi> No, farre be that from me; I only raise a comfort to my selfe, that these great Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God were laid at in their times, as I am now. And 'tis memorable, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> who helped on this Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against Saint <hi>Stephen:</hi> did after fall under the very same himselfe. Yea, but here's a great Clamour that I would have brought in Popery; I shall Answer that more fully by and by; In the meane time you know what the Pharises said against Christ himselfe,<note place="margin">

with that which they most feared: and I pray God this Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of <hi>Venient Romani</hi> (of which I have given no cause) helpe not to bring them in; for the Pope never had such a Harvest in <hi>England</hi> since the Reformation, as he hath now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sects and Divisions that are amongst us, In the meane time, <hi>by Honour and dishonour, by good report and evill report, as a deceiver and yet true,</hi> am I passing through this world, <hi>2 Cor. 6.8.</hi> — Some particulars also I thinke it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse to speake of.</p>
                        <p>And first, this I shall be bold to speake of, the King our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soveraign; He hath bin much traduced also for bringing in of Popery; but on my Conscience (of which I shall give God a very present accompt) I know Him to be as free from this Charge, as any man living; and I hold Him to be as sound a Protestant (according to the Religion by Law established) as any man in this Kingdome; And that he will venture His Life as farre, and as freely for it; and I thinke I doe, or should know, both His affection to Religion, and his grounds for it, as fully as any man in <hi>England.</hi>

                        <p>The second particular is concerning this great and Populous City, (which God blesse.) Here hath beene of late, a fashion ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, to gather hands, and then goe to the Great Court of this Kingdome, (the Parliament) and clamour for Iustice, as if that great and wise Court, before whom the Causes come, (which are unknowne to the many) could not, or would not doe Iustice, but at their appointment. A way, which may endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger many an <hi>Innocent</hi> man, and plucke his bloud upon their owne heads, and perhaps upon the Citie's also: And this hath beene lately practised against my selfe; <hi>[the Magistrates stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding still,</hi>

Which as</hi> Hinde <hi>promised him to be carefull of, calling for punishment from above if he should doe otherwise; so hath he reasonably well performed his promise: the Alterations or Additions which occurre therein, being perhaps the worke of those who perused his Papers, and were to Authorise them to the publicke view, to fit it more unto the palat of the City fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and make it more consistent with the credit of those guilty men, who had voted to his condemnation. This done, he next applied himselfe to the</hi> fatall Blocke, <hi>as to the Haven of his rest. But finding the way full of people, who had placed themselves upon the</hi> Theatre <hi>to behold the</hi> Tragedy, <hi>he desired</hi> he might have roome to dye, <hi>besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them to let</hi> him have an end of his miseries, which he had endured very long. <hi>All which hee did with so serene and calme a minde, as if he had beene rather taking order for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans funerall, then making way unto his owne. Being come neare the</hi> Blocke, <hi>he put off his doublet, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed some words to this effect.</hi> Gods will be done, I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to goe out of this world, no man can be more willing to send me out of it. <hi>And seeing through the chinkes of the boards that some people were got under the</hi> Scaffold, <hi>about the very place where the</hi> Blocke <hi>was seated, he called on the Officers for some dust to stop them, or to remove the people thence, saying it was no part of his desires, that</hi> his bloud should fall upon the heads of the People. <hi>Never did man put off mortality with a brave courage, nor looke upon his bloudy and malicious enemies with more</hi> Christian <hi>charity. And thus farre he was gone in his way towards</hi> Paradise
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54797:14"/>
               <hi>with such a Primitive magnanimity, as equalled, if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the example of ancient martyrs, When he was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what interrupted in his quiet passage by one Sir</hi> Iohn Clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, <hi>a fire-brand brought from</hi> Ireland <hi>by the Earle of</hi> Warwicke <hi>to increase the Combustions in this Kingdome. Who finding that the</hi> mockings and revilings <hi>of malicious people had no power to move him, or sharpen him into any discontent or shew of passion; would needes put in, and try what he could do with his</hi> spunge and vinegar, <hi>and step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to him neare the block, asked him,</hi> (<hi>with such a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose as the</hi> Scribes <hi>and</hi> Pharisees <hi>used to propose questions to our Lord and Saviour</hi>) <hi>not to learne by him but to tempt him, or to expose him to some disadvantage with the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by, what was the comfortablest saying which a dying man could have in his mouth. To which he meekely made this answer,</hi> Cupio dissolvi &amp; esse cum Christo; i. e. I desire to bee dissolv'd and to bee with Christ. <hi>Being asked againe what was the fittest speech a man could use, to expresse his confidence and assurance; he answered with the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of meeknesse, that such</hi> assurance was to be found within, and that no words were able to expresse it rightly. <hi>Which when it would not satisfie the troublesome and impertinent man (who aimed at something else then such satisfaction) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hee gave some word, or place of Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon such assurance might bee truely founded; hee used some words to this effect, that it was the</hi> Word of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>CHRIST, and</hi> his dying for us. <hi>And so without expecting any further questions (for hee perceived by the manner of Sir</hi> Iohn's <hi>proceedings, that there would bee no end of his interruptions, if he hearkned any longer to him) he turned towards his</hi> Executioner <hi>(the gentler and discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er man of the two) and gave him mony, saying, without the least distemper or change of countenance,</hi> here, honest freind, God forgive thee, and doe thy office upon mee with mercy, <hi>and having given a signe when the blow should come, he kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down upon his knees, and prayed as followeth.</hi>

               <head>The Lord Arch-bishops Prayer, as hee kneeled by the Blocke.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord, I am comming as fast as I can, I know I must passe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> through the shadow of death, before I can come to see thee. But it is but</hi> umbra mortis, <hi>a meere shadow of death, a little darknesse upon nature; but thou by thy merits and passion hast broke through the jawes of death. So, Lord receive my Soule, and have mercy upon mee, and blesse this Kingdome with Peace and Plenty, and with brotherly love and charity, that there may not bee this effusion of Christian blood amongst them, for</hi> JESUS CHRIST'S <hi>sake, if it bee thy will.</hi> Then lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his head upon the <hi>Blocke,</hi> and praying silently to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he said aloud, <hi>Lord receive my Soule,</hi> which was the signall given to the <hi>Executioner,</hi> who very dextrously did his office, and tooke it off at a blow: his soule ascending on the wings of Angels into <hi>Abrahams bosome,</hi> and leaving his <hi>Body</hi> on the <hi>Scaffold,</hi> to the care of men. A spectacle so unpleasing unto most of those who had desired his death with much heat and passion, that many who came with greedy eyes to see him suffer, went backe with weeping eyes when they saw him dead; their consciences perhaps bearing witnesse to them, as you know whose did, that they <hi>had sinned</hi> in being guilty of such <hi>innocent blood.</hi> Of those, whom onely curiosity, and desire of novelty brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to behold that unusuall sight, many had not the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to attend the issue, but went away assoon as the speech was ended; others returned much altered in the opinion which before they had of him, and bettered in their resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards the King and the Church, whose honour and religious purposes they saw so clearely vindicated by this glorious Martyr. And for the rest (the most considerable, though perhaps the smallest part of that great assembly) as they came thither with no other intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then to assist him with their prayers, to imbalme his body with their teares,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54797:15"/>
and to lay up his dying speeches in their hearts and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: so when they had performed those offices of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian duty, they comforted themselves with this, that as his life was honourable, so his death was glorious, the pains whereof were short and momentany to himselfe, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit like to be perpetuall, unto them and others, who were resolved to live and dye in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> But to proceed (for I have some few things to note) it was observed, that whereas other men, when they come to the <hi>Blocke,</hi> use to looke pale, and wan, and ghastly, and are even dead before the blow, he on the contrary seemed more fresh and cheerfull, then he had done any part of the day before: a cleare and gallant spirit being like the Sunne, which shews greatest alwayes at the setting. And as the Scripture telleth us of Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> the <hi>Proto Martyr,</hi> that whilst he spake his last Oration before the chiefe <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> of the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 6.15</note> they of the <hi>Counsell looking stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him, saw his face as it had beene the face of an Angell</hi>: so was it generally observed, not without astonishment, that all the while our <hi>Martyr</hi> prayed upon the <hi>Blocke,</hi> the Sunne which had not showne it selfe all the day till then, did shine directly on his face, which made him looke most comfortably (that I say not gloriously) but presently as soone as the Blow was given, withdrew behinde a cloud againe, and appeared no more, as we are credibly adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised by good hands from <hi>London,</hi> though it be otherwise reported in their weekly Pamphlets. And if the bodies of us men be capable of any happinesse in the <hi>grave,</hi> he had as great a share therein, as he could desire, or any of his friends expect: his body being accompanied to the earth with great multitudes of people, whom love, or curiosity, or remorse of conscience had drawne together, purposely to performe that office, and decently interred in the Church of <hi>All hallowes Barking</hi> (a Church of his owne Patronage and Jurisdiction) according to the Rites and Ceremonies
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54797:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> In which it may be noted, as a thing remarkable, that being whilst he lived the greatest Champion of the <hi>Common-Prayer-Booke,</hi> here by Law esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, he had the honour being dead, to be buried in the forme therein prescribed, after it had beene long disused, and reprobated in most Churches of <hi>London.</hi> Nor need po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity take care to provide his <hi>Monument.</hi> Hee built one for himselfe whilst he was alive: it being well observed by Sir <hi>Edw. Dering</hi> (one of his most malicious <hi>enemies,</hi> and hee who <hi>threw the first stone at him,</hi> in the beginning of this <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>) <hi>that Saint</hi> Pauls <hi>Church will be his perpetuall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument,</hi>

               <p>Thus dyed this most Reverend, Renowned, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> Prelate: when he had lived 71 yeares, 13 weekes, 4 dayes; if at the least he may be properly said to dye, the great example of whose vertue shall continue alwaies, not only in the mindes of men, but in the Annals of succeeding Ages, with Renowne and Fame. But how he lived, what excellent parts he was composed of, and how industriously he imployed those parts, for the advancement of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, his Soveraignes Power and Safety, and the Churches Peace, will be a worke becomming a more able pen; unto whose care and diligence I commend the same. And so I leave him to that comfort which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> gives him, and 'tis the greatest comfort can befall those men, which have beene tortured on the <hi>Racke</hi> of malicious tongues: <hi>viz.
