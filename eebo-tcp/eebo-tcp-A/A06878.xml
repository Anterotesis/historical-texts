         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And otherwhiles it fell out ſo, that if the husband had whiſpered ought in his wives eare, within a ſecret roome, where no ſervitor at all, more inward and privie to his life, was preſent, the ſame ſhould the Emperour bee ſure to know the morrow after; no leſſe than if <hi rend="sup">b</hi>

But all the laborious and painfull toyle that they tooke, came to no effect: for after the ſunne riſing, by reaſon of the big ſtreame, narrow, and deepe withall, they were diſappointed of their paſſage over: and whiles they ſeeke for ſmall fiſh boats, or prepare to flit or ſwim upon floats ſet together and pinned in haſt, our legions win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering then at <note n="*" place="margin">

Whereupon when they had aſſayed many meanes and deviſes, even to their uttermoſt perill, and nothing auayled, what with feare, and what with violent reſiſtance, quite put beſide their purpoſe, and doubting which way to take, and whither to go, they drew neere unto the towne Laranda.

And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as they were ſore diſtreſſed for want of food, they went to a place named Paleas, bending toward the ſea, and fortified with a ſtrong wall, where are layd up in ſtore even to this day victuals uſually, diſtributed among the ſouldiers lying in garriſon, to defend all the coſts of Iſauria.

Theſe Brigands then, having eſpied our armie afarre off, and heard the trumpettiers and cornettiers ſound, ſtayed their march, and ſtood ſtill a prety while, and drawing forth their ſwords in threatening wiſe, afterwards went on faire and ſoftly: againſt whom our ſouldiers continuing ſtill reſolute, ready to make head and encounter them with their diſplayed rankes, yea, and knocking their ſhields and ſpeares together (which manner and faſhion ſtirreth vp in warriours both anger and dolour) with this their geſture now hard at hand, greatly terrified them. But thus ſharpe ſet as they were to give battaile, their leaders reclaimed and drew them backe, ſuppoſing it unſeaſonable and inconuenient to hazard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon a doubtfull peece of ſervice, being as yet not farre from the wals of a citie, within the defence whereof they might be all fully ſecured from danger.

And like as a craſie and ſickly bodie is wont to bee ſore diſtempered upon every light grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, even ſo his baſe, faint, and tender mind, ſuppoſing whatſoever hee heard ſpoken, was ſome practiſe or plot deviſed to the loſſe or danger of his life &amp; eſtate, with the ſlaughter of innocent perſons atchieved a lamentable victorie: for looke what martiall man, what honourable perſon or noble gentleman in all his trayne was but by ſome flying rumor charged to have favoured and maintained his <note n="*" place="margin">Magnentius.</note> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies part, ſure he was to have heavie chaines hung upon him, and ſo was drawne and haled like unto a beaſt; yea, and though his very adverſarie or none at all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed hard upon him (as if it ſufficed onely that he was but named, preſented, or accuſed) he had ſentence pronounced againſt him either to ſuffer death, or to loſe his goods, or elſe to be confined within ſome deſart Iſland. This rigor of his was much more exaſperate by information given of certaine offenſive crimes which were commonly divulged, ſounding, as it was ſaid, much to the prejudice of the imperiall majeſtie; and his ſuſpected anger, ſet on fire with flattering ſpeeches (ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all to bloudineſſe) of ſuch favorites as were next about him, ready ynough to aggravate and multiply all occurrences, making ſemblance alſo of exceeding griefe and ſorrow, in caſe the prince forſooth ſhould looſe his life, upon whoſe good eſtate and welfare, as upon a twined thread, the whole world depended, as they with open mouth and counterfeit words gave it out. And therefore repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it is, that he commaunded no man at any time (were he once adjudged to bee puniſhed for theſe or ſuch like offences) to be called backe upon the tendering, as the manner is, of a commendatorie <hi rend="sup">m</hi> teſtimoniall; a thing that hard hearted and inexorable princes have been wont to doe: and this miſchievous or deadly vice, which in others ſometime abateth and waxeth cooler, in him, as age came upon him, grew the hoter, whiles a company of claw-backe flatterers egged him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in his purpoſed courſe: among whom, the principall and of greateſt note was one <hi>Paulus</hi> a <hi rend="sup">n</hi> Notarie, borne in Spaine, who verily under a ſmooth counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance <note n="*" place="margin">or Chancellor.</note> caried a cloſe and ſecret nature: a man paſſing witty and ſubtile, finding out all the hidden waies to endanger folke.

with <hi>Magnentius,</hi> ſeeing they could make no reſiſtance, after he had outrageouſly come over them in manner of a floud, ſuddainly ſeized upon the fortunes and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of many more. Thus went he on ſtill making much ſpoile and havocke, to the utter undoing of a number, impriſoning ſuch as were free borne, and afflicting their bodies with bonds, yea and cruſhing ſome of them with mannacles, whiles (forſooth) he patched and pieced many crimes and imputations together, that he layed to their charge, and all as falſe as might be: whereupon was committed ſuch an impious and wicked fact, as branded the daies of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> with a note of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſhame. There was one <hi>Martin</hi> that ruled thoſe provinces as deputy <note n="*" place="margin">or Iuſtice.</note> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant <note n="*" place="margin">Pro Prafecto.</note>, who grievouſly lamenting the miſeries of the innocent, and oftentimes beſeeching him to ſpare the guiltleſſe; when as he could not prevaile, threatened to depart: to the end that this malicious inquiſitor and perſecutor, at leaſtwiſe for feare of it, might give over at length to draw and induce into open dangers a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple naturally given to quietneſſe and peace. <hi>Paulus,</hi> ſuppoſing that by this meanes his profeſſion and trade would decay, as he was a ſhrewd artiſan, and his crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter in wrapping and linking theſe and ſuch like matters together, (whereupon hee came alſo to bee ſurnamed <hi>Catena, id eſt,</hi> a Chaine) drew the ſaid Deputie Lieutenant himſelfe (who ſtill protected them, whom the other as yet had ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) to beare a part in theſe common perils: and earneſtly bent he was to bring him alſo bound with Tribunes and many others before the <note n="*" place="margin">

At which extremitie of miſchiefe ſo neere at hand, <hi>Martin</hi> throughly provoked, caught up a <note n="*" place="margin">or Rapier.</note> dagger, and aſſaulteth the perſon of the ſame <hi>Paulus.</hi> But for that his right hand <note n="*" place="margin">Haply for the gout, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infirmitie therein.</note> fayled him, ſo that he was not able to give a deadly wound with the ſayd weapon drawne, as it was, hee ſtabbed himſelfe into the ſide: and ſo by this unſeemely kind of death departed he this life (a moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man) after he had attempted by ſome ſtay to eaſe the piteous caſes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Which wicked parts thus committed, <hi>Paulus</hi> all embrued with bloud, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the princes campe, bringing with him a number of priſoners, covered in manner all over with chaynes, as men dejected and plunged into miſerable calamities and wofull ſorrowes: at whoſe comming were the <note n="*" place="margin">Eculei.</note> Rackes <hi rend="sup">p</hi> made readie; the hangman prepared both hookes and wreſting-vices: and of them, many were proſcribed and outlawed, ſome baniſhed, and other had their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by bloudie ſtroke of civile ſword: For, no man well can remember, that under <hi>Constantius</hi> any one went away quiet, whenſoever theſe matters were but by way of whiſpering ſet a foot.

V. <hi>The lively portraiture of the citie of Rome, in her flower and youthfull daies of growth, in her full yeares and ſtrength, in her old age alſo and craſie time full of diſeaſes. Likewiſe, the deſcription of the moſt miſerable estate thereof under</hi> Conſtantius <hi>and</hi> Gallus.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd for as much as I ſuppoſe ſome ſtrangers, who happily ſhall chaunce to reade theſe writings may wonder, what ſhould be the reaſon that when my ſtyle is diverted to ſhew thoſe things that were done in Rome, I relate nothing but of ſeditions, tavernes, and ſuch like baſe matters: I will ſummarily touch the cauſes hereof, and not ſwerve by my good will one whit at all from the truth. What time as Rome began to ariſe with luckie preſaging tokens even at the very firſt to worldly glorie, like to live and flouriſh ſo long as men ſhall remaine upon the face of the earth, to the end that ſhe might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and grow on ſtill to an high eſtate by the firme league of eternall peace; Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Fortune (which for the moſt part uſe to diſagree) concurred both togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: of which twaine, if the one ſhould have failed, ſhe had never mounted to the pitch of that perfection. The people thereof from their very cradle (as one would ſay) and firſt infancy, unto the end of their childhood, which compriſeth the ſpace wel neere of three hundred yeres, endured neighbour-warres even round about their wals: and then, being once entred into the growing age and prime of their youth, after manifold travailes and toyles of warre, paſſed over the Alpes, and beyond the ſea: no ſooner were they ſhot up to their vigorous yeares and perfect manhood, but from all parts of the wide world environed within the cope and curtaine of heaven, they carried away victorious triumphs: And now encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning toward old age, and conquering divers times by the name onely and fame that went of them, betooke themſelves to a more calme and quiet manner of life. Therefore, this venerable and renowmed city, after ſhe had ſubdued and yoked the prowd necks of fierce and ſavage nations, and made lawes (the only ground-works and everlaſting ſtaies or hold faſts of freedome) like a good and thriftie mother, prudent withall and wealthy, committed unto the <note n="*" place="margin">Or Emperours.</note>

But this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſhew and majeſtie of their councels and aſſemblies, is much blemiſhed by the rude diſorder &amp; levitie of ſome few, who conſider not where they were borne; but as if the reines were let looſe unto vices, are ſlipt quite aſide into errors &amp; wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

                  <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio,</hi> when by policie and force of armes he had vanquiſhed king <hi>Antiochus.</hi> But how brave and goodly a thing it is, for a man deſpiſing theſe gaudes and trifles of no worth, to mount and climbe up the long and difficult aſcents of true glory, as <note n="*" place="margin">Vates Aſcraeus.</note> 
                  <hi>Heſiodus</hi> the Poet ſayth, <hi>Cato Cenſorius</hi> hath ſhewed, who being demanded, why among many noble perſonages he had not his owne Image ſtanding: <hi>I had leiffer</hi> (quoth he) <hi>that good men ſhould move queſtion, wherefore I have not deſerved it, than (which of the twaine is the worſe) mutter ſoftly among themſelves, why I have obtained it.</hi> Others againe, repoſing the chiefeſt grace and glory that is, in carroches high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than ordinary, and in the ſuperfluous braverie of ſumptuous apparrell, ſweat againe under their weightie and maſſie mantles, which they may faſten with very claſpes to the ſhoulders, bearing out from the necke, having exceeding fine oure wrought therein and paſſing through, and the ſame ſtanding out from all places, and the left ſide eſpecially: to the end, that theſe inner garments, thus beſet with long jagges and purfles, might ſhine againe with varietie of threads ſeene quite through, and thoſe portrayed and ſhaped after many and ſundry formes of living creatures. Moreover, there are among them ſuch, as, unasked of any man, with a counterfeit gravitie of countenance, extoll their poſſeſſions and patrimonies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely above all meaſure, multiplying the yearely revenewes and profites of their lands fruitfull (as they thinke) by good husbandry, which they vaunt abroad and ſpare not, that they poſſeſſe from Eaſt to Weſt; ignorant as they be, how their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, by whom this greatneſſe of the Romane State reacheth ſo farre, became ſo renowned in the world, not by their riches, but by moſt cruell and bloudie warres; who differing neither in wealth, nor fare at their table, or homelineſſe of apparell from common ſouldiers, conquered all before them by vertue and valour. Hence it was, that the noble <hi>Valerius</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">ſ</hi> 
                  <hi>Publicola</hi> was buried by a contribution of money gathered for him: and the poore wife of <hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Regulus,</hi> together with her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were maintained by the helpe and reliefe of her husbands friends: the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo of <hi rend="sup">u</hi> 
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> had a dowrie given her out of the Chamber of the citie, when the nobilitie were abaſhed to ſee the flower of a bigge and growne virgine unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, and aſhamed at the long abſence of her poore father. But now adaies, if happily thou, a good honeſt man, come as a ſtranger unto one of theſe great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied men, that are ſo puffed up with pride for their full bagges, to do thy duty by way of ſalutation, at the firſt thou findeſt entertainement, as a right welcome and wiſhed-for gueſt; and after many and ſundry queſtions asked (whereby thou art forced to make ſome lyes) thou wondereſt, being never ſeene before, that this great man thus affectionately favoureth thee ſo meane a perſon: inſomuch as it repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thee that thou hadſt not ſeene tenne yeares ſooner theſe happy daies, as a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall felicitie. And thus preſuming confidently upon ſuch Romane courteous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fabilitie, if thou doe the ſame the next morrow, thou art at a ſtand with thy ſelfe, as one altogether unknowne and come of a ſuddaine, whiles that wonderous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager that heartened thee ſo much but yeſterday, is in doubt a long time, who thou ſhouldeſt be, and from whence thou art come.

Moreover, when preparation begins to bee made for theſe long and unholeſome feaſts, which are kept ordinarily after certain ſet times betweene, or the diſtribution of theſe ſolemne doles, or gifture banquets; put to queſtion and debated it is with carefull and ſerious deliberation, Whether it will be meet (excepting thoſe to whom by courſe it is due) that a ſtranger ſhould be invited? and if after full and mature conſultation had, it be agreed upon, That it ſhall ſo be; ſuch an one is called and admitted, who watcheth and waiteth duly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the houſes of Chariottiers, or profeſſeth Dice-play and Cheators craft, or els maketh as though he knew ſome more ſecret arts than ordinarie: for, learned and ſober perſons they even of purpoſe avoid as unluckie folke and good for nothing.

The caſe thus ſtanding, thoſe few houſes which before time were frequented with ſerious ſtudents and profeſſors of learning, ſwell now and overflow with the ridiculous toyes of litherneſſe, reſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with lowd noiſe and ſhrill ringing, as well of wind-Organs as ſtringed inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Furthermore, inſtead of the Philoſopher, a Chaunter; and in place of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14644:9"/>
Orator, a teacher of trifling and toyiſh arts is in requeſt: and whereas the Libraries be ſhut up faſt for ever like unto Sepulchers, framed there be Organs, or water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, huge Harpes like unto chariots, Haut-boys alſo, and no meane furniture for geſturing actors and ſtage-players. Finally, the world is growne now to this baſeneſſe and indignitie, that when aliens and ſtrangers were driven forth of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by the head and ſhoulders for feare (not long ſince) of dearth and ſcarcity of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, yea and the ſtudents or profeſſors of liberall Sciences (whereof the number was exceeding ſmall) without any delay or breathing time, thruſt out, yet were there kept ſtill the followers of wanton geſturing wenches, ſuch as were ſo indeed, or but counterfeits for the time, yea, and there remained behind three thouſand ſuch dancing wenches, not ſo much as once diſturbed and troubled, together with their quiers, and as many maſters and teachers to them: and what way ſoever a man caſts his eye, he may behold a mighty number of women with their haire all to cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and frizled (who if they had wedded, might well by this time for their age have beene the mothers of children at three ſeverall births) dancing and footing it upon the pavements, untill they be weary againe, wagging and winding themſelves with many a turne about, whiles they expreſſe and reſemble an infinit number of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit formes that Stage-playes have deviſed. Moreover, no doubt is made of this, that when Rome was in times paſt the dwelling place of all vertues, the Nobilitie and Gentilrie for the moſt part (if any ſtrangers well borne and of good faſhion, came thither) uſed with many offices of kindneſſe and courteſie to keep them there ſtill (like as the <hi rend="sup">y</hi> Lotophagi in <hi>Homer</hi> with their ſweet fruits and pleaſant berries.) But now, ſuch is the vanitie and pride of ſome, that they eſteeme all bred and borne without the wals of the citie, to bee baſe and of no worth, unleſſe they be child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and unmaried folke: and incredible it is, what obſequious loating and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there is at Rome ſundry waies to ſuch perſons as are without children. And for as much as among them, as in the head place of the world, grievous diſeaſes reigne and rage in the higheſt degree, for the allaying and aſſuaging only whereof, no art of Phyſicke is of any force; deviſed there is a preſervative and helpefull meane therefore, to wit, that no man ſhould viſite and ſee a friend, that ſuffereth ſuch maladies. And among thoſe few warie cautions and proviſoes there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effectuall remedie ordained, namely, That ſuch ſervants as have beene ſent to enquire how thoſe of their acquaintance doe that are held with this diſeaſe, they receive not into the houſe againe, before they have cleanſed their bodies with a bathe: ſo fearefull be they even of an infection, that other mens eyes onely have ſeene. And yet, as carefull as they be in theſe points to ſave themſelves, ſome you ſhall have (enfeebled otherwiſe, and much weakened in their lims) if they bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to a marriage, where gold is offered with hollow right hands, to goe luſtily and nimbly ynough even as farre as to <note n="*" place="margin">Spoleto.</note> Spoletium. Well, theſe be the courſes that the Gentry take. To ſpeake now of the multitude, which conſiſteth of the baſe and poore commons; ſome paſſe all the night long in the wine tavernes, others lurke within the ſhadie boothes and bowers of Theatres, which <hi>Catulus</hi> imitating the wantonneſſe of Capua, in his Aedileſhip pitched and reared firſt: or eagerly play at dice, making a foule and unſeemely noiſe with ſnuffing and drawing backe their wind inwardly at their broken noſethrils: or elſe (which of their delights is the greateſt) from morning to night they abide till they faint againe, in raine, or ſunne-ſhine, enquiring diligently after the chiefe prizes or delinquencies both of chariotters, and alſo of horſes. And a very wonder it is, to ſee ſo infinite a number

of the common people with ſuch an ardent mind and affection, depending upon the event of theſe chariot-runnings and contentions for the beſt game. Theſe and ſuch like vanities ſuffer no ſerious and memorable thing to bee gone in hand with at Rome. Now therefore I am to returne unto my text.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14644:13"/>
of the Forges, who bare theſe names, as having promiſed ſome meanes and helpes to worke revenge when time ſhould ſerve. And verily <hi>Epigonus,</hi> a Philoſopher in habit onely and apparrell, when he had by much entreatie craved favour in vaine, after that his ſides were tewed and gaſhed, yea and the feare of death was preſented unto him, by a ſhamefull confeſſion avouched himſelfe to bee partie and acceſſarie in ſuch plots and projects as never were, whereas hee had neither ſeene nor heard anything, ſilly man he, as one altogether unacquainted in law matters and judiciall proceedings.

And led forth he was to execution, with a feareleſſe and unappalled courage reproching the iniquitie of thoſe daies, and following the example of that auncient Stoicke <hi>Zeno,</hi> who having beene tortured a long time, for to expreſſe ſome lyes from him, plucked his owne tongue from the very root, and with his ſpettle all bloudy, ſpit it at the very eyes and face of the <hi rend="sup">l</hi> Cyprian king, as he queſtioned with him. After this, the royall garment aboveſaid was ſought for: and when the ſervants that died purple, upon torturing had confeſſed a little jacket for the body, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without ſleeves, there was brought in one named <hi>Maras,</hi> a Deacon, as the Chriſtians tearme him, to give evidence: whoſe letters written in the Greeke tongue unto the Maſter or foreman of a Weavers ſhoppe in Tyrus, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: wherein very urgently hee called upon the ſaid party, to have the peece haſtened forward; but what peece he ſhewed not.

For every one of you in his ranke and iudgement duly conſidering with himſelfe, findeth this to be true, That the ſouldior in all places, although he be ſtrong and vigorous in body, looketh to himſelfe onely, and defendeth his own life: But a Generall and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all offices, whiles he, the keeper of other mens lives, is indifferent unto all, knoweth, that the regard and conſideration of his people cannot but concerne his owne defence and ſafetie, and there withall skilleth remedies that the ſtate of buſineſſes doth admit, ought to take hold of all advantages and good occurrents that by Gods will and providence are preſented.

In ſumme, I rest waiting upon you as ampiers to know what yee adviſe, now that I a quiet prince deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and conclude it meet, upon ſo happy fortune falling unto us, in temperate wiſe to uſe moderation.

alſo for to bee of diſcreet carriage and adviſed counſell: that <hi>Gallus</hi> of his owne nature fell ynough, was by certaine perſons ſuborned for the nonce, animated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to cruel acts for this cauſe, That after he was become odious, and had incurred the worthie deteſtation of all eſtates and degrees, the enſignes and ornaments imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all might be transferred unto the <note n="*" place="margin">Vrſicinus.</note> maſter of the horſemens children. When theſe and the like matters were once buzzing in his carefull and timorous cares, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alwaies and open to ſuch rumours, whiles his mind was ſwelling and working divers waies; at the laſt upon counſell given he tooke the beſt courſe: and firſt he commaunded <hi>Vrſicinus</hi> in very honourable tearmes to come unto him, pretending this, that, according as the urgent occaſions and affaires of that time required, there might by joint counſell and conſent a good order bee ſet downe, and namely, what encreaſe of forces were requiſit to repreſſe the invaſions of the Parthicke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that threatened open warre. And leaſt before his comming he ſhould ſuſpect any harme toward him, <hi>Proſper</hi> a <hi rend="sup">ſ</hi> Comes was ſent as his vice-gerent or deputie, untill he returned: who when he had received letters, and had a licence graunted to take up wagons for carriage, he made great journeyes, and haſtened to Millaine. It remained now, that after this, <hi>Caeſar</hi> likewiſe ſhould be ſent for with ſpeed: and for to put away all ſuſpition, <hi>Conſtantius</hi> by many faire and flattering words ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his wife <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note>, now after ſo long time and ſo much deſired and miſſed as ſhe was, to come unto him. Who albeit ſhe ſtood in doubt, as fearing him ſo often bloudily minded, yet in hope that ſhee might appeaſe and pacifie him her naturall brother, ſhee taketh her journey: and when ſhe was entred into Bithynia, in a certaine <note n="*" place="margin">or baiting place, or lodging.</note> ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion named Coenos Gallicanos, ſhe died ſuddainly of a violent fever. After whoſe death, her husband ſeeing and conſidering that the truſt and affiance wherewith he thought himſelfe ſurely upheld was fallen, ſtood perplexed in penſive cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with himſelfe what way to worke. For in the preſent eſtate of his, ſo troublous, ſo intangled and brought into the briers, his carefull mind ran ever upon this one thing, That <hi>Constantius</hi> meaſuring and weighing all according to his own will and pleaſure, would neither admit ſatisfaction, nor pardon offence; but (as hee was a prince too much bent to the overthrow of his kinred) cloſely lay ſnares for him, and if hee tooke him once at unawares in a trip, would bee ſure to put him to death. Being brought to this hard exigent, and looking for no other than extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, unleſſe he watched the better, he made no more adoe, but ſhot at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt place of all, if meanes any way might have beene made unto it. But for want of faithfull dealing in his friends about him, forſaken he was in two reſpects; both for that they ſtood in great feare of him, a cruell and fickle minded prince, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe they did much dread the fortune of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> which in civile diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions uſually had the upper hand. Amid theſe huge heapes of infinite cares, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he received continually from the Emperour, putting him in mind and praying him to come away, yea and ſhewing (farre otherwiſe than he meant) that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Commonwealth neither could nor ſhould be divided, but every man ought to his power for to lend his helping hand unto it, troubled as it was, and waving to fro; pointing herein at the waſting and ſpoiling of Gaule: to which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he alledged a precedent and example of no great antiquitie, namely, that unto <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and his colleague, the <hi rend="sup">t</hi>

And, as it uſually falleth out when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinies lay hand on men, that their wits are made blunt and their ſences dulled, by theſe allurements hee was raiſed up againe to the hope and expectation of better fortunes:</q> and ſo departing out of Antioch in an ill houre, &amp; without the guidance of Gods favour, went juſt as the old proverbe ſaith, out of the ſmoke into the light fire: and after he was entred into Conſtantinople, as in time of proſperitie, like one ſecured of his eſtate, he exhibited the games of <hi rend="sup">x</hi> horſe-running, and adorned the head of <hi>Corax</hi> the chariottier as victor, with a crowne. Which when <hi>Constantius</hi> knew, beyond all meaſure hee chafed: and leaſt peradventure the ſame <hi>Gallus,</hi> doubtfull of the future events, might goe about in his journey to attempt ſome meanes expedient for his owne ſafetie, all the ſouldiors were of purpoſe removed, who abode in the cities that ſtood in the way. And at that very time <hi>Taurus,</hi> a Quaeſtor ſent into Armenia, confidently paſſed by and balked him, not vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing to ſalute, or once to ſee him. Howbeit, ſome there came by commandement of the Emperour, in ſhew of doing divers duties and ſervices, but readie indeed to obſerve and keepe him, that he might not be able once to breake out nor attempt any ſtirre ſecretly. Among whom was <hi>Leontius,</hi> governour of Rome afterwards, as <note n="*" place="margin">Vt Quaeſtor praefectus urbi.</note> Quęſtor or Treaſurer for the time being; alſo <hi>Lucilianus,</hi> as it were <note n="*" place="margin">Quaſi domeſtico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum comes.</note> captaine of the guard, and the <note n="*" place="margin">Scutariorum Tribunus</note> Tribune of the Squires of the bodie, named <hi>Bainobaudes.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore travailed a long way in the countrey, and the ſame lying plaine, when he was entred into <note n="*" place="margin">Hadrianopoli.</note> Hadrianopolis (a citie of <note n="*" place="margin">A Region in Thracia.</note> Haemimontum) called before time Vſcudama, refreſhing himſelfe wearied with travaile, for the ſpace of twelve dayes, hee underſtood that the <note n="*" place="margin">Thebaeas legiones.</note> Thebęan <hi rend="sup">y</hi> legions, wintering in the neighbour townes, had ſent certaine of their conſorts and companions to encourage him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their faithfull and ſure promiſes to ſtay behind. Truſting then confidently in his owne ſtrength, he beſtoweth them in the ſtations, bordering &amp; confining there together. But ſuch was the watchfull care and obſerving eye of thoſe about him, that he could not catch any time or oportunitie either to ſpeake ought, or to heare what intelligences they brought. Then, after more letters ſtill received one in the necke of another, urging him to be gone, having withall the uſe of tenne waggons allowed by the State, according to a warrant given, leaving all the trayne of the palace, unleſſe it were ſome gentlemen of the bed-chamber, and ſervitors at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whom he had taken to him to give neere attendance; all ſorrowfull now, and even made of miſeries compelled he was to haſten his pace, by reaſon that many drave him forward, curſing ever and anon with ſhedding teares his owne folly and inconſiderate raſhneſſe, which had put him now a deſpiſed and abject caitife under the will and pleaſure of weake and feeble perſons. Yet amid theſe troubles, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time that nature tooke her reſt, his ſences and ſpirits were wounded with dreadfull ſpectres and fanſies skreaking hideouſly round about him: and whole
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14644:16"/>
companies of thoſe whom he had killed, with <hi>Domitian</hi> and <hi>Montius</hi> leading the way, caught him up, preſented him to the hookes and clawes of the Furies, as hee imagined in his ſleepe. For the ſoule, looſened from the bonds of the body, being alwaies freſh and in motion, never wearied, ſubject alſo to the cogitations and cares that diſquiet mens minds, gathereth night viſions, which we call <hi>Phantaſias.</hi> And thus whiles a moſt heavie deſtinie opened the way of fatall neceſſitie, whereby or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained before it was, that he ſhould be deprived both of life and imperiall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, having paſſed all the journeyes betweene, by changing of freſh horſes, he came to <note n="*" place="margin">Pettaw. <hi>Lazio.</hi>

And now went not he to worke by way of ſhaddow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſſimuled deceit; but whereas the palace ſtood without the wals, hee did beſet it round about with armed men: and ſo entring into it before it was full day light, he tooke from <hi>Caeſar</hi> all regall garments, and clad him in a coat and common ſouldiors caſſocke upon it, aſſuring him and binding it with many an oath, as it were by the Emperours commandement, that he ſhould not thenceforth ſuſtaine any harme: and forthwith, <hi>Riſe up,</hi> quoth he: and ſo mounting him ere hee was aware upon a privat chariot, led him into Iſtria, neere unto the towne <note n="*" place="margin">otherwiſe called Iulia Pietas.</note> Pola, where ſometimes (as I have heard ſay) <hi>Criſpus Conſtantius</hi> ſonne was killed. And when he was kept there moſt ſtreitly, not worth the ground he went on, but buried as one would ſay alreadie (ſuch was the terror of his end ſo neere at hand) there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth thither unto him in all haſt <hi>Euſebius,</hi> at that time Lord great Chamberlaine, with <hi>Pentadius</hi> the Notarie, and <hi>Mellobaudes</hi> captaine of the <hi rend="sup">b</hi> Armature, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement from the Emperour, to compell him for to ſay and ſhew particularly for what cauſe he had commanded every one of them to be killed that were put to death at Antioch? Whereto changing colour, and looking as pale as <hi rend="sup">c</hi> 
                  <hi>Adrastus,</hi> he would have anſwered to this effect, That moſt of them he had murthered through the inſtigation of his wife <hi>Conſtantina:</hi> not knowing verily, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, when his mother lay hard upon him to kill a certaine innocent perſon, and ſaid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes withall, in hope of obtaining afterward what ſhe deſired, how ſhee caried him nine moneths in her wombe; wiſely gave her this anſwere: <hi>Good mother aske ſome other reward &amp; recompence; for the life of a man is ſo deare, as no benefit can coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervaile it.</hi> Now the Emperour when he underſtood this, falling into an irreclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fit of anger and wrath, repoſed all the aſſurance and confidence hee had of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing his owne ſecuritie, in making him away. And ſending <hi>Serenianus</hi> (who as we ſhewed before ſtanding indicted of the crime of Majeſtie, by means of certaine ſubtile ſleights and juggling caſts was acquit) <hi>Pentadius</hi> alſo the Notarie, and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demius</hi> the Meſſenger or Purſevant aboveſaid, adjudged him to ſuffer death, and to loſe his head: and ſo with his hands bound and pinnioned together, like unto ſome theefe and malefactor, his head was ſmitten off: thus when the beautie of his face and head was gone, there lay the trunke of his deformed carcaſſe left alone, which a little before was dread of cities and whole provinces.</p>

For, not onely it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed <hi>Gallus</hi> ſuddainely with a cruell and bloudie end, but alſo not long after both of them died a moſt painefull death, who by their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearing kindly deluding and beguiling <hi>Caeſar,</hi> an offendor though he were, drew him on untill he fell into the net and toyle that coſt him his life: of which twaine, <hi>Scudilo</hi> by a diſtillation or colliquation of the liver caſting up his lungs, died: and <hi>Barbatio,</hi> who a long time had falſely framed matter of crime againſt him, when, after he had beene colonell of the Footmen, he was by the ſecret whiſperings and ſuggeſtions of ſome charged to aſpire and reach over-high, and hereof condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to make ſatisfaction unto <hi>Caeſars Manes,</hi> that by his fraudulent practiſe came to his end, ſacrificed his owne life by a reprochfull death. Theſe and an infinite ſort of ſuch like examples, <hi>Adrastia</hi> (who hath a two-fold name, and is called alſo <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſis)</hi> the revenger of wicked and ungodly acts, as alſo the rewarder of good deeds, worketh and bringeth about otherwhiles, and would God it did ſo alwaies. A certaine high power or authoritie of the mightie and operative heavenly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhe is, according to the opinion and capacitie of mens underſtandings, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon the ſphaere of the Moone: or, as ſome define her, a ſubſtantiall Tuition or Defence, by a generall power preſident over the particular deſtinies: who, as the auncient Divines or Theologers, faining her to be the daughter of Iuſtice, doe teach, by vertue of a certaine hidden eternitie overſeeth all earthly things. Shee as Queene of cauſes, and Iudge of matters, ſhe alſo as an umpire to arbitrate, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth and ſhaketh the pot of lots, making alternative turnes and changes of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: and what our wils have enterpriſed and begun, bringing the ſame other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles to another iſſue and end than they aymed at, ſhee ſhuffleth and rolleth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold actions together, by exchange of one for another. And the ſame power, with the inſoluble bond and hold-faſt of neceſſitie, binding the pride of mortall men, ſwelling in vaine, and turning to and fro, as ſhe knoweth full well, the weights of increments and detriments both, of riſings &amp; fallings, one while preſſeth downe and weakeneth the ſtiffe necks of high minded men, another while raiſing up good men from below, advanceth them to an happie life. Now hath fabulous antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie therefore fitted wings to her, that by her flight-ſwiftneſſe ſhe might be thought preſent in all places: and given her the helme or rudder of a ſhip to carrie before her, yea, and put a wheele under her, that it might not be unknowne, how ſhe run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through all the elements ruleth the univerſall world.

And now by this time, after the horrible fall of <hi>Caeſar</hi> thus put to death, whiles the trumpet of judiciall dangers ſounded the alarme, <hi>Vrſicinus</hi> was accuſed of high treaſon, for that envie, hurtfull to all good men, grew more and more to the prejudice of his life and eſtate. For, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged he was with this one difficultie, in that the Emperours eares, faſt ſtopped for admitting any equall plea and reaſonable defence, lay open to the ſecret ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of cloſe enemies, who deviſed, That the foreſaid Generall, now that the name of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> became quite forgotten in all the tracts of the Eaſt, was much miſſed and wiſhed for both at home and abroad, as the onely dreadfull enemie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Perſian nation. But the magnanimous knight ſtood unmooveable againſt all accidents whatſoever, very heedfull and warie, that hee might not ſeeme over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſely to caſt himſelfe downe in deſpaire: yet grieving &amp; groning at the very heart, that innocencie had no ſure place of ſafe repoſe; and in this one regard more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily appaied, for that his friends, who heretofore flocked about him, were revolted to the mightier ſide, much like unto officers and ſergeants, that according to the cuſtome, are wont to goe from their old maſters to new magiſtrats their ſucceſſors. Moreover, his colleague <hi>Arbetio,</hi> under a faire ſhew of counterfeit courteſie, and by calling him many times a valiant warriour (as hee was paſſing skilfull in laying traines for to entrap a man of plaine and ſimple converſation, and withall in thoſe daies of great authoritie) proved his heavie friend, and ſet himſelfe ſore againſt him. For, like as a ſerpent under the ground, lying cloſe hidden within his hole, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving every one that paſſeth by, fiercely on a ſuddaine aſſaileth them: even ſo he, joyning his office alſo in warfare unto the power that he had to hurt, being neither harmed at any time, nor ſo much as provoked by him, polluted his conſcience with an unſatiable will and purpoſe to doe miſchiefe. Well, forced he is, making ſome few captaines privie to his ſecrets, cloſely to breake with the Emperour, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale his mind. Agreed it had beene, that in the night following <hi>Vrſicinus</hi> caried violently away farre out of the ſight of the ſouldiors, ſhould be killed without any condemnation: even as in times paſt, by report, <hi rend="sup">a</hi>

This plot thus layd, and the match ſet, when thoſe that were appointed to doe the feat waited the time aforeſaid, ſuddainely this counſell turned to be more mild, and commaundement was given to put off ſo wicked an act unto a ſecond conſultation. And ſo from him, the whole engine of forging calumniations, was turned upon <hi>Iulian,</hi> newly brought thither (a renowmed prince afterwards) and intangled within a two-fold crime, as the iniquitie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of men deemed it: firſt, for that from Marcelli-Fundus, a place lying in Cappadocia, he had flitted into Aſia, upon a deſire he had to learne the liberall ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: and againe, becauſe hee had ſeene his <note n="*" place="margin">Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And when every

man was to ſeeke what to adviſe or ſpeake to the point, namely, to make choice what ought to bee done; mention ſoftly was made of <hi>Vrſicinus,</hi> as a moſt worthie man for his policie in warre affaires, and one who had beene provoked, upon no <note n="*" place="margin">Fruſtra.</note> deſert of his, with grievous injurie: ſent for he was by the chiefe gentleman uſher, a thing uſually done by way of great honour: and no ſooner was hee entred into the Counſell chamber, but the purple robe was preſented unto him: and ſo they ſet him as a ſuppliant at the Emperours feet, after the manner of forraine kings, whereas we read that alwaies before, our Emperors were ſaluted like Iudges. Thus he, who a little before with malicious and ſpightfull railing was tearmed the <note n="*" place="margin">Orientis vorago.</note> Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing-pit or Waſter of the Eaſt, yea, and complained of for aſpiring to uſurpe the ſoveraigne place by the meanes of his ſonnes; then (forſooth) became a moſt politicke and wiſe leader, as who had beene a fellow-ſouldior with <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great: and hee alone was called for to quench the fire by good and honeſt meanes (I muſt needs ſay) yet covertly and by way of a traine. For great care was had, and diligence uſed, that <hi>Silvanus</hi> might be deſtroyed as a moſt ſtrong and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant traytor to the State: or, if that ſhould miſſe, yet <hi>Vrſicinus,</hi> alreadie exulcerate, and carrying rancour in his heart, be utterly aboliſhed, to the end that no ſcruple ſhould remaine behind, greatly to be feared. Therefore, whiles order was in giving to make haſt and ſet forward on his journey, as the ſaid Generall went about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale and confute the crimes that had beene objected unto him, the Emperour by way of prevention with a mild ſpeech ſtayed him, ſaying, It was no time then to goe in hand for to traverſe any cauſe, or put in his plea for defence, conſidering the neceſſitie of urgent occurrents, which was to bee mitigated before it grew more; inforced rather, that on both ſides they ſhould grow to tearmes of former concord and old love. After much debating therefore and long deliberation, this point was principally handled, What device to uſe, that <hi>Silvanus</hi> might think the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had as yet no knowledge of his deſignes and doings? there being at length a probable matter found out to aſſure him thereof, adviſed he is by letters penned in honourable tearmes, That when hee had received <hi>Vrſicinus</hi> as his ſucceſſour, hee ſhould returne with his whole power and authoritie untouched.

we made, a certaine wandering and flying fame had gotten the ſtart of us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed the thing; ſo that being entred into Agrippina, wee found all above our reach. For by reaſon of a multitude of people, who (from all parts thither aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled) were in grounding ſure the enterpriſes ſo haſtily begun, beſides other great forces gathered together, as the preſent ſtate required; we tooke this to be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way, That our pitifull and lamentable leader <note n="*" place="margin">Vrſicinus.</note> ſhould be framed and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date to the mind and will of this new Emperour, who aſſured himſelfe by vaine mockeries of pręſaging ſignes, that his ſtrength encreaſed: and all to this end, that whiles with ſundrie counterfeit ſhewes of flatterie his ſecuritie proked him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to a milder courſe, he fearing no hoſtilitie at all, might be deceived. But the iſſue of this our project ſeemed difficult and dangerous. For, indeed, it would have ſtood better with good policie and our ſafetie, to take heed that our deſires might have had a correſpondencie with oportunitie, neither running before nor lagging behind it: which if they ſhould breake out before their due time, ſure we were all, by vertue of one writ or word, to ſuffer death. Howbeit, the ſaid captaine of ours being mildly received, and forced (the preſent buſineſſe it ſelfe requiring no leſſe) to bow downe and ſtoupe, yea, and to adore in ſolemne wiſe (as the manner is) him that aſpired ſo high to the purple robe, was eſpecially regarded and made much of: and being now moſt inward (as having eaſie and readie acceſſe unto him and the honour to ſit at his royall table) ſuch preheminence he had above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that by this time hee was uſed in ſecret conſultation about the maine points of importance, and the very Empire it ſelfe. <hi>Silvanus</hi> tooke it to the heart, that when unworthie perſons were advanced to the dignitie of Conſuls, and other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable places of high government, himſelfe and <hi>Vrſicinus</hi> alone, after ſo great and manifold paines endured for the weale publique, were ſo deſpiſed; that he for his part cruelly abuſed by ſifting and examining his familiar friends, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a baſe manner of proceeding and triall, ſhould bee accuſed of treaſon: and the other againe, through the malice and hatred of his enemies haled out of the Eaſt, and brought home. Theſe continuall complaints made hee both ſecretly and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen place. And yet for all theſe and ſuch like ſpeeches, terrified were we with the mutinous grumbling on every ſide of the ſouldiors, alledging their want, and hote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet in all the haſt to breake through the ſtreights of the <note n="*" place="margin">Monte Genebre, or Mont Cenis.</note> Cottian Alpes. In this perplexitie and doubtfull trouble of heart wee cloſely caſt about and ſought for ſome device like to take effect; and in the end, after many alterations of our mind by reaſon of feare, reſolved thus, That when wee had with great induſtrie gotten warie miniſters, and bound our communication with a religious oath and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, there ſhould be ſollicited the Braccati and Cornuti <hi rend="sup">n</hi>, companies wavering in their allegeance, and for large hire mutable and readie to turne every way. After therefore that this buſineſſe was made ſure, by meanes of certaine baſe mediators and brokers betweene, who for their obſcure condition were meet to worke the feat, and ſet on fire beſide with the expectation of rewards, when the Sunne was now ariſing, ſuddainely a crew of armed men breaketh forth: and as it falleth out in ſuch doubtfull caſes, being more bold and hardie after they had ſlaine the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, entred into the palace, plucked <hi>Silvanus</hi> forth of a little chappell, whither hee was fled all amated and breathleſſe, and as he was going to a congregation of the Chriſtian Religion, with many ſtrokes of ſwords ſlew him out-right. Thus a brave leader, and a man of no meane deſert, died this kind of death, even for feare of ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous accuſations, wherewith by the faction of his enemies he was in his abſence
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14644:23"/>
enſnared and entangled; ſo that for the ſafetie of his life he was driven to proceed unto the utmoſt extremitie of all ſhifts. For, albeit in regard of that iſſuing foorth of his ſo ſeaſonably with young and gallant ſouldiors before the battaile at Murſa, hee held <hi>Constantius</hi> obliged unto him for a good turne, yet feared hee him as a prince variable and uncertaine; although he might pretend the valiant acts of <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> alſo his father, a Franke verily, and who in the civile warre behaved himſelfe many times right manfully, taking part with <hi>Conſtantine</hi> againſt the <note n="*" place="margin">The faction of <hi>Licinius</hi> the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> Licinians.

This was the obſtinate ſelfe will of the time, ſearching narrowly upon ambiguous tearmes and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into theſe and ſuch like matters: and whiles ſome deadly and peſtiferous whirle-puffe raiſeth up ſtill theſe miſeries of common miſchiefes in the State, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontius</hi> governing <note n="*" place="margin">Aeternam urbem.</note> Rome, gave many good teſtimonies and proofes of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Iudge, in hearing of cauſes quicke, in deciding and determining moſt juſt, of his owne nature friendly and favourable (howſoever hee ſeemed to ſome for the maintaining of authoritie ſharpe and ſevere) and withall very much enclined to love. The firſt device therefore to ſtirre up a ſeditious tumult againſt him, was moſt baſe and vile: For when <hi>Philoromus</hi> the <note n="*" place="margin">or runner.</note> Chariot-driver by commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to be drawne and harried away, all the commons in generall following after, as readie to reſcue and defend their owne deare child, with terrible violence did ſet upon the ſaid <hi rend="sup">p</hi>

Sitting therefore in his chariot with a lovely ſhew of boldneſſe and confidence, he beheld with piercing eye the faces of thoſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14644:24"/>
unruly crewes (as if they had beene ſo many ſerpents) ruffling with a foule noiſe, and crie on every ſide: and taking knowledge of one fellow above all the reſt, big and huge of ſtature, and with a reddiſh or yellow head, him he asked, Whether he were not <hi>Peter,</hi> ſurnamed (as he had heard him called) <hi>Valvomeres?</hi> and when he anſwered, and that in a kind of chiding accent, that he was the man, him he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded (as one whom he had knowne of old to be the chiefetaine and ring-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſeditious rebels) for all the contradiction and gaineſaying of many, to have his hands bound behind at his backe, and ſo to be hoiſted and hanged <note n="*" place="margin">Vpon a kind of racke.</note> up in the aire. Who being ſeene once aloft, calling hard, but in vaine, for the helpe of thoſe that were of his owne ſept and tribe, all the whole multitude, that a little before ſtood ſo thicke thruſt together, diſperſed now into ſundrie parts of the citie, vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out of ſight, ſo as that this hote and buſie ſtirrer of commotions having his ſides racked and torne, as it were in a ſecret judiciall place of torture, was expelled and ſent away into <note n="*" place="margin">Marca Ancona.</note> Picenum: where afterwards, daring to offer abuſe and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to a virgine of no meane patronage, hee was therefore upon ſentence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Patruinus</hi> the <note n="*" place="margin">Conſulari.</note> Preſident, judged and condemned to looſe his head. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the government of this <hi>Leontius, Liberius</hi> a biſhop of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was by a precept directed from <hi>Constantius</hi> ſent to the <note n="*" place="margin">Ad Conutatum.</note> privie Counſell, as one oppoſing himſelfe againſt the Emperours commaundements, and the decrees of many his owne conſorts, in a matter which I will briefely run over. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> biſhop at that time of Alexandria, bearing himſelfe too high above his profeſſion, and one who went about to enquire into matters that to him belonged not (as the dayly bruit and rumor went of him) the congregation (or the Synode, as they tearme it) of the ſame place, excommunicated and remooved from the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall dignitie, which he held and celebrated. For reported it was, That being paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing skilfull in Necromancie, and expounding the truth of oracles and prophecies, as alſo well ſeene in thoſe things which the Augurall birds portended and praeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, he had divers times fore-told future events. Over and beſides theſe matters, charged he was alſo with other points, diſagreeing from the purpoſe and meaning of that Law or Religion, whereof he was Prelate. This <hi>Athanaſius, Liberius</hi> the biſhop being of the ſame mind and opinion with the reſt, was by commandement from the Emperor warned by his ſubſcription to depoſe from his ſacerdotall See: but hee ſtiffely withſtood and denied ſo to doe, often crying out, That it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull even in the higheſt degree to condemne a man unſeene and unheard; open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as one would ſay) ſpurning againſt the Emperours will and pleaſure. For hee, an enemie alwaies bitterly bent againſt <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> although hee knew the thing was performed accordingly, yet earneſtly deſired, that the ſame might bee confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ratified by that authoritie which the biſhops of Rome enjoy. Which for that he could not obtaine, <hi>Liberius,</hi> without much adoe and great difficultie even at midnight (for feare of the people that loved him exceedingly) could not be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away.

When he had upon the urgent occaſion of ſo many imminent calamities bewrayed thus much to his favourites and friends next about him, ſhewing in plaine tearmes, That himſelfe, but one, ſhrunke now (which hee never had done before) under the burthen of ſo many neceſſities and troubles comming ſo thicke upon him: they beeing throughly taught how with exceſſive flatterie to beare him up, foolified and gulled the man, telling him ever and anone, That there was nothing in the world ſo adverſe and difficult, but his powerfull vertue and heavenly fortune together were able (as ever heretofore) to overcome: and many of them pricked in conſcience for their offences committed, ſaid thus much moreover, That he was from henceforth to beware of the name of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> rehearſing therewith the lewd parts committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Gallus.</hi> Againſt whom labouring hard upon this point, the Queene alone op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed her ſelfe, were it for very feare to flit into ſo farre countries; or that in her own naturall wit and wiſedome ſhe thought it good policie for the State, I wote not: but ſhe ſaid, That a kinſman ought to bee preferred before all other. And after much debating of the matter, by way of deliberation to and fro, this reſolution ſtood firme: and ſo ſetting aſide all frivolous and bootleſſe diſputations, hee fully determined to take unto him <hi>Iulianus,</hi> as his compartener in the imperiall governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now, when he was ſent for and come at the day prefixed, the Emperour, after all the companies of fellow ſouldiors there preſent were called together, and a Tribunall erected upon an high banke, above which ſtood the maine ſtanderds of Eagles and other enſignes, he mounted up unto it, and holding <hi>Iulianus</hi> by the right hand, thus by way of a mild and gentle ſpeech began to ſay. <hi>Here ſtand we before you, right valorous defendors of the Weale publique, to maintaine in manner all with one breath and ſpirit the common cauſe, which I, being to plead, as it were, before equall Iudges, will briefely declare unto you. After the death of rebellious tyrants, whom rage and furie moved and egged on to attempt theſe deſignes which they proiected, the Barbarians, as if they meant with Romane bloud to ſacrifice unto their wicked Manes, invade Gaule, and over-run it, having broken the peace of the marches; encouraged upon this confidence and aſſured perſuaſion, that extreame neceſsities bind us fast ynough, by occaſion of lands ſo farre diſ-ioyned aſunder. This miſchiefe therefore, which incrocheth</hi>

                  <hi>alreadie beyond the frontiers hard adioyning, if (while time permitteth) our helpe and yours together, after conſultation had, ſhall ioyntly with one accord meet with; both the neckes of theſe prowd nations will not ſwell ſo big, and the bounds alſo of our Empire ſhall remaine entire. It reſteth now, that the hope of our affaires which I doe conceive, yee alſo ſtrengthen with fortunate effect. This</hi> Iulianus <hi>here, mine unckles ſonne by the fathers ſide, well approoved (as yee know well ynough) for his modeſtie, in regard whereof, as well as of neereneſſe in bloud, he is deare unto us; a young gentleman of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious action, which alreadie appeareth in him, I wiſh to ioyne with me, in the place and power of a</hi> Caeſar: <hi>Which motion of mine, if you thinke the ſame profitable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient is to be confirmed alſo by your graunt and allowance.</hi> As he was about to ſay more to this effect, the aſſembly interrupting his ſpeech, in gentle manner ſtayed him, ſaying in a fore-knowledge (as it were) of the future conſequence, That this was the will and choice of mightie <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and not of mans wit and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And the Emperour ſtanding ſtill without ſtirring, untill they were ſilent, went more confidently through with the reſt of his ſpeech: <hi>For as much as</hi> (quoth he) <hi>your ioyfull acclamation ſheweth, that there is a correſpondencie of your favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſent, let the young gentleman endued with a peaceable vigour, and whoſe tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate behaviour is to be imitated rather than commended, riſe up to this honour, ſeconded with your fortunate favour; whoſe ſingular towardneſſe, inſtructed with good arts, even herein, me thinkes I have fully ſhewed, in that I have choſen him. Him therefore, by the grace and preſent direction of the heavenly God, will I clad in his princely robes.</hi> This ſaid he, and ſoone after, when he had put upon <hi>Iulian</hi> his grandfathers pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and declared him <hi>Caeſar</hi> with the joy of the armie; he ſpeaketh unto him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſad and carrying a demiſle and lowly looke, in this manner: <hi>Thou hast in thy prime, brother mine, and the most loving brother that ever I had, recovered the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious flower of thy parentage and originall: augmented (I confeſſe) is mine owne glorie, who take my ſelfe more truly advaunced, by conferring a ſuperiour power upon a noble prince of mine owne bloud than by the ſoveraigne power it ſelfe, which I enioy. Come on therefore as partaker of paines and perils, undertake the defence and ſervice of Gaule, as one readie by all bountifulneſſe to eaſe the parts afflicted: and if need require to ioyne battaile with the enemies, ſtand to it with ſure footing among the very enſigne-bearers themſelves, a conſiderate exhorter and encourager to adventure in due time; by leading the way with adviſed warineſſe heartening and emboldening them that fight; with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours and ſupplies ſtrengthening thoſe that be troubled, and in diſarray; in modeſt tearms rebaking the ſlouthfull; a preſent and moſt true witneſſe, as well to the induſtrious ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dior as to the idle coward. Therefore, as urgent ſervice requireth, on forth like a valiant Knight to lead likewiſe as hardie ſouldiors: we will be aſsiſtant one to another in our turnes by courſe, with firme and ſtedfaſt love: ſerve we will together, and another day (if God graunt our requeſt) ioyntly governe the world with equall moderation and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

Some ſay, That after the deſtruction of Troy, a few that fled from the face of the Greekes, and were every where diſperſed, poſſeſſed themſelves of theſe places then lying void. But the inhabitants of theſe countries vouch this above all other, (which alſo we have read engraven in their monuments of record) That <hi>Hercules</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Amphitryo</hi> made haſt to deſtroy <hi>Geryon</hi> and <hi>Tauriſcus,</hi> two cruell ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; of whom, the one infeſted Spaine, the other Gaule: And after he had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed them both, that he lay with the gentlewomen of the countrey, on them begat many children; and that they called after their owne names thoſe parts which they had rule of.

in the province of Vienna. Then afterwards in the ages enſuing, they, as their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſance encreaſed, founded many townes: But I muſt forbeare ſuch varietie, which oftentimes hath ſatietie joyned with it. Meane while, as the men of this place were growne by little and little to civilitie, the ſtudies of laudable ſciences, begun by the Bards, Eubages, and Druides, mightily flouriſhed here. And verily the Bards ſung unto the ſweet muſicke of the Harpe the valorous deedes of worthie men compoſed in heroicke verſe. But the Eubages, ſearching into the higheſt altitudes of natures worke, endevoured to lay open and declare the ſame. Among theſe, the Druidae of an higher wit and conceit, according as the authoritie of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> decreed, being tied unto ſocieties and fellowſhips, were addicted wholly unto que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of deepe and hidden points, and they deſpiſing all humane things, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that mens ſoules were immortall. This climate of Gaule, by reaſon of the high and difficult riſings of mountaines, and thoſe alwaies covered over with hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heapes of ſnow, before time unknowne almoſt to the inhabitants of all the world beſide, unleſſe it be where it coaſteth upon the ſea, is encloſed on every ſide with fences that environ it naturally, as if it were by art of man. And verily, on the South ſide the <note n="*" place="margin">Mar Toſco, or Mar de Marſeille.</note> Tyrrhene and Gaule ſeas both runne cloſe by it: toward the North divided it is from ſavage nations by the river Rhene: and Weſtward with the Ocean and the high mountaine <note n="*" place="margin">Which now hath many names according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts thereof.</note> Pyrenaeus: And what way it beginneth to mount up Eaſtward, it giveth place to the high banks of the Cottian Alpes: which king <hi>Cottius,</hi> after that Gaule was conquered and ſubdued, lying hidden alone cloſe within the ſtreits, and truſting upon the unacceſſible roughneſſe of the craggie places, when his feare was well at length allayed, and himſelfe received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the friendſhip of the Emperour <hi>Octavian,</hi> in lieu of a memorable gift, with great and labourious workes made to ſerve for a compendious way, and commodious to travailers, as ſtanding juſt in the midſt betwixt the other old Alpes: as touching which I will report anone what I have learned and knowne. In theſe Cottian Alpes, which begin at the town <note n="*" place="margin">or Reguſio. <hi>Suſa Leandro.</hi>
                  </note> Seguſio, there peaketh up a mightie high mount, that no man almoſt can <note n="*" place="margin">Penetrabile.</note> paſſe over without danger. For, as men come out of Gaule, it bendeth ſteepe forward with a great downe-fall, terrible to behold, by reaſon of the cliffes hanging on either ſide, eſpecially in the Spring: what time as the froſt and yce thaweth and the ſnow melteth with the hot breath of the winds, by the ſtreits broken on both ſides, and the holes or ditches hidden with heapes of frozen yce, men verily with ſtaggering and ſtaying their feet make ſome ſhift to come downe; but horſes and carts fall headlong forward. Now, for to put by this miſchiefe, one remedie alone hath beene deviſed: namely, that moſt of the wagons with mightie great ropes tied faſt unto them, and a maine ſtrength of men and oxen both, ſtraining behind to ſtay the ſame, ſcarcely with a creeping pace, ſomewhat more ſafely come rolling downe. And this, as I have ſaid, happeneth in the Spring time of the yeare. But in Winter, the ground charged all over with a coat of yce, and (as it were) ſmoothed therewith, and thereby ſlipperie under foot, ſetteth men forward in their gate to run upon their noſes; and the open val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies along the broad and wide plaines, not to be truſted, by reaſon that the yce will not beare, ſwallow up otherwhiles folke paſſing thereupon. In regard of which dangers, thoſe that be cunning in the waies, and know the countrey well, pitch downe faſt certaine piles or maine ſtakes of timber, bearing their heads above the ground all the way along the ſafer places, to the end that the way faring man dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by them, as they ſtand in a row, may paſſe without harme: which if they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

to lye hidden and hilled with ſnow; and namely, being overthrowne before with land flouds or rivers falling downe from the mountaines, hardly are they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable with the guidance of the ruſticall people, leading the way. Now from the very pitch of this Italian cliffe, there reacheth a plaine for the ſpace of ſeven myles unto a ſtation named Martis: and from hence another high hill more upright, and with much adoe to be paſſed over, ſtretcheth forward as farre as to the head or top of Matrona; the occaſion of which name came by a chaunce that befell unto a noble woman: From whence the way verily lyeth ſteepe downe, but yet more eaſie and travaileable, as farre as to the Fort <note n="*" place="margin">or Brigantium, about which ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the towne Brianſon.</note> Virgantia. The Sepulchre of the ſaid pettie king, who I have reported made thoſe waies above-named, is at Seguſio, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neere unto the wals, and his Manes for a two-fold reaſon are devoutly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, both for that hee had ruled his owne ſubjects by way of a juſt and moderate government; and alſo becauſe he being received into alliance with the Romane ſtate, procured perpetuall peace and reſt unto that nation. And albeit this way which I have ſpoken of, be the middle one, and therefore compendious, and the ſhorter yea, and more haunted, yet others alſo have beene made long before at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times. The firſt of them, <hi>Hercules</hi> of Thebes, marching in a milder manner to deſtroy <hi>Geryon</hi> (as hath beene ſaid) and <hi>Tauriſcus</hi> cauſed to bee wrought neere unto the maritime Alpes, and this <hi>Hercules</hi> gave them their name: Semblably, the caſtle of Monoecus, and the haven, he conſecrated to the everlaſting memoriall of himſelfe. Then, after the revolution of many ages, upon this occaſion were the Alpes Poeninae deviſed. <hi>Publius Cornelius Scipio,</hi> father of the elder <hi>Africanus,</hi> when the Saguntines, memorable for their miſeries and fidelitie both, were upon a conſtant reſolution of the Mores beſieged, being about to goe into Spaine for to aid them, tranſported over a fleet, manned with a puiſſant power of ſouldiors. But when the citie <note n="*" place="margin">Morvedre.</note> Saguntum was by mightier forces deſtroyed, he not able to reach and overtake <hi>Anniball</hi> (who having three daies before paſſed over <note n="*" place="margin">Rhoine.</note> Rhodanus, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched apace to the parts of Italie) croſſed over betweene with ſwift ſayle an arme of the ſea, which was no long cut, and watched for him at <note n="*" place="margin">Genoa.</note> Genua, a towne of <note n="*" place="margin">Riviera de Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa. <hi>Oriel.</hi>

Howbeit, having regard to the maine chaunce and common good, he adviſed his brother <hi>Cn. Scipio</hi> to goe into Spaine, for to keepe backe <hi>Haſdruball,</hi> who was likewiſe to get out and come from thence.

For the Acquitanes, (unto whoſe coaſts, as being next at hand, and peaceable, marchandiſe uſed to be brought from other parts) after they fell once in their demeanor and carriage to be delicate, were ſoone brought under the Romanes dominion. Now, the whole countrey of Gaule, ever ſince that they were driven by ſo many urgent warres to yeeld unto <hi>Iulius</hi> Dictator, hath beene ruled by a <note n="*" place="margin">or a Tetrarchie.</note> government divided into foure parts.

This <note n="*" place="margin">Rhoſne.</note> Rhodanus flowing from the Poenine Alpes, with ſtore of Springs guſhing forth in great plentie, and running downe apace directly toward the plaine countrey with his owne ſtreame, and no more, hideth the bankes, and ſo engorgeth himſelfe into the lake named <note n="*" place="margin">Lac de Lozanne &amp; de Geneve.</note> Lemanus: and albeit he runneth within the ſame, yet entermingled he is no where with other waters beſides his owne: but gliding of the one ſide over the ſlower and more ſtill ſurface of the water, ſeeking an iſſue, with a ſwift current maketh way forth of it. From whence, without hurt of any thing, he runneth through the thicke fennes, and the <note n="*" place="margin">Eurgognons.</note> Sequani, and after he hath gone a great way forward, paſſeth lightly hard by the province Viennenſis on the left ſide, and Lugdunenſis on the right. Having thus rid a great ground with his wavie ſtreame, he taketh unto him <note n="*" place="margin">Saone.</note> Araris, which they call Sauconna, running within the firſt Germanie, and giveth it his owne name. In which place begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Gaule. From thenceforth they uſe to meaſure their journeyes, not by myles, but by leagues: and there Rhodanus growne bigger, and charged with other ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers falling into him, carrieth exceeding tall and big ſhippes, that uſe oftentimes to be toſſed with gales of wind: and ending among the vales which nature hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be his preſcript limits, frothing now and foming, is incorporate into the Gauliſh ſea by an open frith or gulfe called <note n="*" place="margin">otherwiſe called Gallious Sinus.</note> Ad gradus, lying from Arles almoſt tenne miles. Thus much as touching the ſite of the places. Now will I deſcribe the ſhapes and manners of the people. The Gaules in manner all be of ſtature tall, of complexion cleere, white, and of ruddie haire, carrying in the caſt of their eyes a kind of terrible and ſterne grimneſſe, given much to brawles, and exceeding inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: for if any one of them be ſet a chiding and brawling, having the ſhrew his wife (who commonly of the twaine is the ſtronger by farre, and of a ſallow hew) to take his part, a whole band of others that be ſtrangers, is not able to match him: eſpecially when ſhe, ſetting out her necke with big ſwollen veines, fals a grating of her teeth, and levelling her ſnow white armes, and thoſe of a mightie big ſize, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins once to lay about her with fiſts and heeles together, as if they were bolts and darts diſcharged violently from the writhed and wreſted ſtrings of a brake or ſuch like engine: the ordinarie words of moſt of them, as well when they are pacified as angrie, are dreadfull and full of menacing. But all of them, with like diligence and curioſitie, are neat and cleane: neither in thoſe tracts, and eſpecially in Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania, ſhall you ſee a woman (be ſhe never ſo poore) in foule and ragged clothes, as in other places. Every age among them is moſt meet for warfare: and with like courage and hardineſſe of heart is the old man brought into the field, and the luſtie youth carrying about him limmes hardened with froſt and continuall travaile, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to contemne many and thoſe fearefull occurrents: Neither is there ever knowne any one of them (as in Italie) for feare of going to the warres, to cut off his owne thumbe, and ſuch as ſo doe, they tearme merrily by way of jeaſt, <hi>Murcos.</hi> A

And when he had ſtayed there a little time, while he provided for his wearied ſouldiers, thinking it not good to ſlacke his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he goeth ſtreight to the citie of Rhemes: Where hee aſſembled his whole armie together, and charged them to give attendance, and wait his comming at <note n="*" place="margin">Beſanſon.</note> Veſontium: the governour whereof was <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Vrſicinus;</hi> and <hi>Vrſicinus</hi> himſelfe was commaunded to abide in thoſe parts unto the end of this expedition. Wherefore, after many and ſundry opinions delivered, when it was agreed once to ſet upon the people of Alemaine in ten territories, the ſouldiers in thicke ſquadrons marched thither more willing and cheerefull than they had wont: and for that the day was ſo foggie and darke, that they could not ſee a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall way before them, the enemies having this advantage, that they knew the coaſt of the countrey, traverſed a croſſe crooked way behind <hi>Caeſars</hi> backe, and charging upon two legions as they were gathering their armour together, they had put them all well neere to the ſword, but that a ſuddaine outcrie made, cauſed the aid-forces of our aſſociates to aſſemble themſelves.

As he pondered and carefully caſt theſe matters in his mind, a multitude of enemies giveth an attempt upon him, mightily enſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with hope to win the towne; and the more confident in this their enterpriſe, becauſe they had learned by the information of certaine fugitives, that neither the band of the <hi rend="sup">b</hi> Scutarij nor <hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentiles were there, as being beſtowedin ſundry town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips for their better feeding and diet.

Hereupon it happened, that hee divided the nights ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a tripartite or threefold function, <hi>For ſleepe, for affaires of State, and for his booke:</hi> a courſe that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, as we read, uſed to take. But this our prince did the ſame more ſtoutly of the twaine. For <hi>Alexander</hi> having a baſon or pan of braſſe ſet beneath by his beds ſide, held with his arme ſtretched out of the bed, a ſilver ball, that as ſleepe came upon him, and had let looſe the ſtiffe ſinewes of his joints, by the ringing ſound that the ſaid ball made when it fell downe, he might breake off his ſleepe: But <hi>Iulian,</hi> without any ſuch deviſe or meanes, wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as oft as he would; and riſing alwaies at midnight (not out of a featherbed, or from under coverings of ſilke, glittering againe with ſundrie bright colours, but from a quilt or tapiſtrie carpet ſpred on the ground, or ſome homely rugge, which the ſimple common people tearme Suſurna) ſecretly did his devotions, and prayed unto <hi>Mercurie,</hi> who (as we are taughtout of the learning of Theologie) is the ſwift intelligence of the world, ſtirring up the motion of our minds; and in ſo great want of things, upon ſure advertiſements provided for the Commonweale. After which high and ſerious buſineſſes ended, he turned himſelfe to the exerciſe of his wit: and a man would not beleeve with how great and ardent deſire in ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the profound knowledge of principall matters, and in gathering together cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine forage and ſtoovet (as it were) for to feed his mind, climbing up ſtill unto higher points of learning, he by way of wiſe diſputation ran through all parts of Philoſophie.

Beſides all this, he was able to diſcourſe and deliver his mind ſufficiently in the Latine tongue. If then it be true which divers writers report, That king <hi>Cyrus, Simonides</hi> the Lyricke Poet, and <hi>Hippias Elêus</hi> that moſt quicke and eagre Sophiſter, had excellent memories, for that they attained thereto by drinking certaine medicines; we are to thinke veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this man alſo being then come to his full growth, dranke up a whole tunne of Memorie, if poſſibly it might any where be found.

Now, when the ſaid parents of the maidens complained of the indignitie they ſuffered, in that the partie was not put to death, this anſwere he made: <hi>Thus farre forth</hi> (quoth he) <hi>let the lawes blame my clemencie: but as for an Emperour, hee ought to excell others in the lore of a moſt mild and gracious mind.</hi> Hee was on a time about to goe foorth to a certaine warlike journey or expedition, and many called upon him by the way for juſtice, as having ſuſtained ſome wrongs; whom he put over and commended to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of provinces, to have their complaints heard: and after his returne, he enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what every one of them had done, and according to his gracious mercie that naturally he had, he mitigated the puniſhments of their offences. Laſt of all, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide his victories, whereby he put to flight or defeated the Barbarians, whom he ſlew in battaile, without touch many times of any contumacie, hereby moſt of all it appeareth, what good he did unto the Gaulois, labouring (as it were) for life in extreame penurie, in that when he entred firſt into thoſe parts, hee found there was demaunded by way of tribute five and twentie pieces of gold for every poll, but at his departure thence, ſeven onely for full ſatisfaction of all duties: in regard whereof, they rejoyced with cheerefull mirth and dauncing, as if the cleere Sunne after ugly darkeneſſe had ſhone upon them. To conclude, wee know, That unto the very end of his Empire, and to his dying day, he obſerved this one thing right profitably, that in matter of paying tribute he remitted not the overplus remaining and arrerages, by way of indulgences, as they call them: for well he wiſt, that in doing ſo, he ſhould ſomewhat mend and better the eſtate of the rich; whereas well knowne it is, that the poore every where, in the very beginning of the <note n="*" place="margin">Dictoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exordia.</note> taxes and impoſts, are compelled to make full payment, without any eaſement or relaxation at all. Howbeit, amid theſe courſes and waies that hee tooke, to rule and governe with moderation, which good princes are to ſtrive to imitate, the rage and furie of the barbarous nations brake out into a flaming fire: and like as wild beaſts, wont to live of ravine and prey when keepers be ſlacke and negligent, uſe not to depart and leave their wont when theſe are removed, no not if ſtronger be ſet in their place, but growing outrageouſly wood for hunger, without regard of life, run upon whole heards and flockes of cattell: even ſo they alſo, when all was ſpent which they had gotten by ſpoyle and pillage, as hunger urged them, divers times raiſed and drave booties away, and otherwhiles againe, before they could meet with ought, came ſhort and died for it.</p>

Whiles he fell a forging of theſe imputations in licentious manner, <hi>Euthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> (according to his owne requeſt) was brought in place, and commaunded to ſpeake what he would; who in modeſt tearmes and few words ſheweth, how the truth was coloured and covered with lyes: For <hi>Caeſar</hi> (quoth hee) having beene long beſieged in Senones, while the <note n="*" place="margin">Marcelius.</note> Captaine <hi rend="sup">f</hi> of the Forces ſlacked his ſervice and ſat ſtill (as it was verily thought) of purpoſe, by provident and watchfull indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie <note place="margin">Magiſtro armoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> drave backe the Barbarians: and withall he undertooke even with the paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his owne head for it, that the ſaid <hi>Iulian</hi> ſhould continue during his life a loyall miniſter and dutifull ſervitour to his firſt founder. This preſent matter hath put me in mind to inſert ſomewhat briefely as touching the ſame <hi>Eutherius;</hi> for that if <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> or <hi>Socrates</hi> ſhould give ſome good reports of a guelded perſon, and bind the ſame with a religious oath, they would bee charged to have ſwerved much from the truth: but, <hi>among brambles there grow roſes, and of wild beasts ſome waxe tame and tractable.</hi> Wherefore, I will ſummarily declare the principall things that have beene knowne concerning him. Being borne in Armenia of free pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, and taken priſoner by the enemies borderers, and even whiles he was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little one carried away, ſold he was unto a couple of Romane marchants, and brought to the palace of <hi>Constantine:</hi> where by little and little, what with skilfull training, and what with good government, he gave ſufficient proofe of an honeſt courſe and carriage of life, as alſo of wit and knowledge: as being inſtructed in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature

as much as might ſuffice one of that ſtate and calling, paſſing quick of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in deviſing and inventing of doubtfull and ſcrupulous queſtions: it exceeded alſo, what an excellent memorie he had: very deſirous to doe good, and full of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous counſell: whom if <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperour would haue regarded in times paſt, when he was in his growth and youthfull yeares, he might have heard him as one of maturitie and ſtayed ripeneſſe, giving many precepts and leſſons tending to honeſtie and juſtice, and then had he not ſinned at all, or at leaſtwiſe committed but veniall treſpaſſes.

Moreover, having retyred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aſide to a quiet life, and afterwards being taken eftſoones into the palace (as he was of ſober behaviour alwaies, and paſſing well ſtayed) two notable and ſingular vertues, Faithfulneſſe and Continence, he embraced ſo, as that he was not challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at any time, as the reſt have beene, either to have diſcloſed a ſecret, unleſſe it were to ſave another mans life, or to have burnt in greedie deſire of getting and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more. Whence it came to paſſe, that withdrawing himſelfe anone after to Rome, and there ſetled and reſiant untill he was well ſtept in yeares, carrying about with him a good conſcience to keepe him companie, eſteemed hee is and loved of all degrees: whereas ſuch kind of perſons are wont commonly, after they have gotten riches by unjuſt and indirect meanes to ſeeke for ſecret corners, as flyers of the light, ſhunning the ſight of the multitude whome they have wronged. To which of all the guelded Eunuches in old time I ſhould compare this <hi>Eutherius,</hi> in peruſing many a time the monuments of antiquitie, could I never find. For there were long ſince in our aunceſtors daies, ſome of them, though very few, truſtie and profitable [to their lords,] yet ſtained and ſpotted with certaine vices: For with thoſe ſpeciall good qualities which any one of them had gotten by ſtudious ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or naturall wit, he was either given to greedie extortion, or over-fiercely and felly bent, or hotely ſet upon doing miſchiefe, or too too kind and pleaſing to thoſe that loved him, or elſe exceſſive prowd in the over-weening of his own greatneſſe: but of any one Eunuch, every way ſo skilfull and well qualified, I confeſſe I never read nor heard, notwithſtanding I have preſumed upon the ſufficient teſtimonie of our age. But if happily any curious reader of Antiquities, ſet in oppoſition againſt us <hi>Menophilus,</hi> an Eunuch to <hi>Mithridates</hi> king of Pontus, let him upon this adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement call to remembrance, That nothing hath beene recorded of him but this onely, which he gloriouſly ſhewed in his utmoſt extremitie: The foreſaid king, after he had in a mightie great battaile beene vanquiſhed by the Romans and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius,</hi> flying to his ancient inheritance the kingdome of <note n="*" place="margin">or Colchis, now called Mengrelia and Lavia. <hi>Nig.</hi>

Now when he approched the citie, as
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14644:34"/>
he beheld with a gracious countenance the Senatours according to their places giving attendance in dutifull wiſe, and the reverend preſence of the noble Patrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; he thought not as <hi>Cyneas</hi> that embaſſadour of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> did, that a number of kings were aſſembled together, but the very temple &amp; ſanctuarie of the world was there in place. From whom, when hee had turned himſelfe toward the common people, he wondered exceedingly, how quickly all the men in the world thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed to Rome. And as if hee had beene to terrifie Euphrates or Rhene with a ſhew of armour, as the enſignes went on both ſides before, himſelfe was mounted alone upon a chariot of gold, glittering againe with bright precious ſtones of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie ſorts; with whoſe ſhining there ſeemed to be a certaine mingled light, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold degrees, in an alternative courſe, of high powers in authoritie: whiles others againe were compaſſed about with the Dragons, wrought with woufe of purple thred, and thoſe faſtened to the tops of ſpeares, all gold, and ſet with coſtly gems, gaping and blowing with wide mouth, and therefore hiſſing as if they were angry, and therewith leaving their winding tailes to wift in the wind. And on both ſides marched a double ranke of armed men, with targuets and creſted helmets, ſending raies and beames from them of brandiſhing light, wearing upon them fine <note n="*" place="margin">or ſhirts of maile</note> haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons: and the men of armes here and there entermingled on bard horſes, whom the Perſians uſe to call Clibanarij, harneſſed all over with good corſelets, and bard about with guards of ſteele: ſo as one would have taken them for Images finely poliſhed by the hand-worke of <hi>Praxiteles,</hi> and not for men indeed: about whom alſo there went thin plated hoopes, made fit and handſome for the bending of their bodies, and running all over their limmes; ſo that which way ſoever they had need to ſtirre and moove their joynts, the apparrell or habiliment would agree thereto, the joyning thereof was ſo meet, and ſerved ſo well every way.

For both he bowed downe his bodie (and that was very low) as he entred in at any high gates; and alſo with a ſtiffe necke, as if both head and it had beene of one piece all armed, caſting his eye directly before him, he turned his face neither on the right hand, nor the left, as if he had beene the image of a man: neither was he ſeene ſo much as to give a nod with his head, when the wheele ſhogged, nor to ſpit or wipe his lips, or blow or rub his noſe, no, nor once to wag his hand: which albeit he did with an affectation, yet were theſe geſtures and ſome other beſides which he uſed in the reſt of his life, no ſmall tokens of patience and ſpeciall gifts that he alone had, as it well might be thought.

And oftentimes, as he exhibited the games of horſe and charriot-running, he tooke much delight in the merrie jeſts and ſcoffes of the common people, as long as they were not prowd and inſolent, nor ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the manner of their in-bred and native libertie, himſelfe alſo in good reſpect and reverence keeping a due meane: For he ſuffered not (as in other cities) the games to bee ended at his owne pleaſure, but (as the manner is) permitted many things, and yeelded unto divers chaunces. Afterwards taking a full view as well of all parts of the citie, ſituate within the tops of the ſeven hils, partly upon the bending of them, and in part on the plaine beneath, as alſo the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbes without the walls by the citie ſide; whatſoever was preſented to his ſight firſt, that thought he to ſurmount all the reſt; and namely, the temples of <hi>Iupiter Tarpeius,</hi> as farre ſurpaſſing as heavenly things excell the earthly: goodly Baines built in manner of provinces: the huge frame of the Amphi-theatre ſtrongly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up and wrought with Tiburtine ſtone, cloſely layed and couched together; up to the top and loover whereof hardly can a man ſee: the Pantheon, like unto a round region ſupported with arch-worke right beautifully, of a great height: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the loftie pulpits and mounts, elevated with aſcents up to them by winding ſtayres, carrying the counterfeits and perſonages of Conſuls and former princes: likewiſe the Temple of the citie, the Hall of peace, the Theatre of <hi>Pompeius,</hi> the <note n="*" place="margin">The Theatre of Muſicke and Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</note> Odeum <hi rend="sup">h</hi> and Stadium, <hi>i.</hi> the Race; beſides other ſtately buildings and beauties, among theſe, of that eternall citie. But when hee was come to the goodly Hall of <hi>Traianus,</hi> the moſt ſingular piece of worke under heaven (as we thinke, yea, and by the aſſent of the very gods admirable) he ſtood ſtill as amazed, whiles he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and thought of thoſe gyant like workes round about, ſo ineffable, and not of mortall men to be reached at and attempted againe. Without all hope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to endevour or attempt any ſuch thing, onely the horſe of <hi>Traian,</hi> ſtanding in the middeſt of the Court yard, on which the Emperour himſelfe is portraied ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he ſaid: <hi>That he both would and alſo could imitate:</hi> whereat <hi>Hormiſda,</hi> a prince of the <note n="*" place="margin">of Perſia, or a Perſian Courtier.</note> bloud royall, ſtanding hard by him (whoſe departure out of Perſis I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before) ſhaped him this anſwere, and that after the manner of his countrey geſture: <hi>Commaund O Emperour</hi> (quoth he) <hi>the like ſtable to be built before, if thou be able: then the horſe which thou art diſpoſed to make may come after and take up as</hi>

In this meane while <hi>Euſebia</hi> the <note n="*" place="margin">or Empreſſe.</note> Queene, beeing her ſelfe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine all her life time, practiſed even then againſt <hi>Helena,</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and wife of <hi>Iulianus Caeſar,</hi> who was brought to Rome under a colour of love and affection, and by a wyle drew her on to drinke a medicine little better than poyſon, which ſhe had gotten for her, to this end, that ſo often as ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with child, ſhe might miſcarrie, and caſt an untimely fruit: For before time alſo in Gaule, when ſhe had brought foorth a man child, ſhe loſt it by this deceitfull caſt: for that the midwife (bribed for a piece of money) by cutting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the navell-ſtring of the new-borne babe (more than was meet) killed it: ſo great care and ſuch diligence was uſed, that the iſſue of ſo valiant a man might not come to light, or grow to good proofe. Well, the Emperour very willing and deſirous to make ſome long abode in this ſeat, of all others moſt full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, to the end he might thereby enjoy more pure repoſe and pleaſure, was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with continuall newes, and thoſe reported for certaine, which gave him to underſtand, That the Suevians made roades into the Rhaetiae, that the Quadi alſo invaded <note n="*" place="margin">part of Pannonia</note> Valeria, yea, and that the <note n="*" place="margin">Tartarians.</note> Sarmatians, a people moſt expert in theeving and robberie, waſted the upper * Maeſia, and the ſecond <note n="*" place="margin">part of Hungarie.</note> Pannonia. <note place="margin">Moldavia of ſome.</note> Wherewith he being much mooved, upon the thirtieth day after he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rome, to wit, the <note n="*" place="margin">29. of May.</note> fourth before the Calends of Iune, tooke his journey from the citie, and haſtened by the way of <note n="*" place="margin">per Tridentum.</note> Trent into Illyricum.

with their owne right hands, as taking great ſnuffe and indignation, becauſe they could have nothing of that proviſion of corne which was newly brought unto them: for that <hi>Barbatio,</hi> when he paſſed hard by, prowdly caught it up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, and the reſidue which remained behind, he layed, upon an heape, and burnt it every jot. Which, whether he did like a vaine and braine-ficke foole, or boldly enterpriſed many wicked attempts by commaundement from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, was not then knowne. Howbeit, this was bruited abroad in all places, and rife in every mans mouth, That <hi>Iulian</hi> was not choſen <hi>[Caeſar]</hi> to give eaſement to the diſtreſſed ſtate of Gaule, but that hee might by moſt cruell warres there come to his end, being then (as it was thought) but a freſh-water ſouldior, and one that could not endure ſo much as the clattering noyſe of armour. Well, whiles the worke about the ſayd fort goeth apace forward, whiles part of the ſouldiors maketh fore-fences abroad in the fields, and others againe gather corne warily, for feare of ambuſhments, the barbarous multitude preventing with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding celeritie the rumour of their comming, having violently on a ſuddaine ſet upon <hi>Barbatio</hi> and the armie which hee had the conduct of (as hath beene ſaid) divided and ſevered from them by a Gauliſh fortification, and following them in chaſe as farre as to the Rauraci, yea, and further as long as they could, after they had carried away the greateſt part of their carriages, labouring beaſts, and campe ſlaves, returned home againe. And he, as if hee had performed a notable and fortunate expedition, beſtowed his ſouldiors here and there in their Wintering harbours, and returned to the Emperours Court, minding to frame an action and accuſation againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as his manner was, readie at all times bitterly to aſſayle and vexe him. When this foule foyle and terrour was once diſperſed and ſpread abroad, the Aleman kings, <hi>Chonodomarius</hi> and <hi>Veſtral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, Vrius</hi> alſo, and <hi>Vrſicinus,</hi> together with <hi>Secapio, Suomarius,</hi> and <hi>Hortarius,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling all their forces and power together into one place, ſat them downe neere unto Argentoratum, ſuppoſing that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was retyred for feare of utter extremitie, whereas he continued ſtill buſily employed about the finiſhing of the fort aboveſaid.

Moreover, king <hi>Chonodomarius</hi> bearing himſelfe big in every place, and the chiefe ſetter of dangerous enterpriſes, kept a great ſtirre, and made a trouble and confuſion of all beyond meaſure, lifting up his browes aloft with a prowd looke, as one highly conceited, in regard of the fortunate ſucceſſe many times of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires: for not onely in a plaine pitched field he encountred <hi>Decentius Caeſar,</hi> and gave him the overthrow, but alſo raſed and ſacked many wealthie cities, yea, and for a long time invaded and over-ran Gaule at his pleaſure, whiles there was none to gaineſay or withſtand him. And that which confirmed yet more his confident boldneſſe, was the freſh diſcomfiture and flight of a great <note n="*" place="margin">Barbatio.</note> Leader, who for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and puiſſance had the ods. For the Alemans beholding the badges and armes of their ſhields, knew them to be the ſame ſouldiors, who had let ſome few of their brigands and robbers enjoy land, for feare of whome, ſundry times when they buckled in cloſe flight, with loſſe of many, they went away diſperſed and in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>array. Whereat <hi>Caeſar</hi> was very penſive, and tooke the matter grievouſly, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (upon urgent neceſſitie driving him thereto) eſcaped ſuch daungers, he was now enforced with a few (though valorous men) to affront and encounter ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous nations. And now that the bright Sunne beames began to appeare, and the trumpets to ſound the footmen were led foorth marching faire and ſoftly, and the troupes of light horſemen flanked them on the ſides as wings, betweene which were beſtowed the <note n="*" place="margin">

For as in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous adventures meet it is there ſhould be a forwardneſſe of manhood and boldneſſe; ſo (if occaſion require) the ſame ought to be regible, adviſed, and conſiderat. What mine opinion is therefore, if your iudgement ſhall accord thereto, and iuſt indignation endure, I will in briefe declare.

For as much therefore, as against most difficult buſineſſes a diſpoſe and order thought upon in time hath oftentimes affoorded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, and when right counſell given hath beene taken in good part, divine meanes even from heaven above ſometimes have recovered and ſet upright the tottering eſtate of mens affaires; here, I beſeech you, let us (empaled within a rampire and trench) take our reſt, dividing the watches by turnes: and having for the time enioyed the benefit of ſleepe and food convenient, advaunce forward (with the leave of God be it ſpoken) at the breake of day our triumphant ſtandards and victorious enſignes.</hi> The ſouldiers, that could not well endure untill the end of his ſpeech, gnaſhing and grinding their teeth, and ſhewing their hot deſire to fight by knocking their ſheilds and ſpeares together, beſought him earneſtly, That they might be led foorth to give the enemie battaile, who now was within ſight, truſting upon the favour of God in heaven, confident alſo in themſelves, and preſuming upon the approoved vertues of their fortunate leader and director, and (as the end ſhewed) a certaine comfortable <note n="*" place="margin">or Angell.</note> Genius there in place readie, ſo long as he was preſent, excited them to fight. To helpe forward this alacritie and cheerefulneſſe of theirs, there was the full aſſent alſo of the great captaines and high officers, eſpecially of <hi>Florentius,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Praefecti Praetorio.</note> Praefect of the Praetorium; who all with one accord agreed, That great reaſon they had on their ſide to fight, (though it were with much danger) whiles the barbarous enemies preaſſed on all in plumpes and heapes; who if they once ſhould turne aſide out of the way, hee ſaid, that the ſtirres of our ſouldiors (given too much upon an in bred heat of theirs to ſeditious commotions) would bee intollerable, as who could hardly endure, without the attempt of ſome extreame courſe, the victorie (as he thought) wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted out of their hands. Furthermore, a two-fold conſideration there was, that encouraged and emboldened our men, calling to remembrance, that the yeare laſt paſt, when the Romanes raunged at their pleaſure all over the countries beyond Rhene, there was not ſeene any man to defend his own dwelling houſe, or to make reſiſtance: but when the lanes and wayes on every ſide were ſtopped up with the lopping and cutting downe of trees lying thicke together, during the nipping cold of mid Winter, the Barbarians thus remooved farre off, had much adoe to live: as alſo, that vpon the Emperours entrie into their lands, they not daring eyther to reſiſt or to ſhew their heads, upon their humble requeſt and entreatie obtained peace. But no man conſidered all this while, that the caſe of the times was alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for then they were combred &amp; kept downe with a three-fold miſchiefe: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, while the Emperour lay ſore upon them in Rhaetia, <hi>Caeſar</hi> hard by, permitted them not to eſcape any where, and the next borderers (whom civile diſcords cauſed to be their enemies) were readie in a manner to tread upon their necks behind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus hemmed in on every ſide. But afterwards, upon a graunt of peace the Emperour being departed, thoſe neighbor nations now after the matter and cauſe of their brawles allayed, were reconciled and growne to agreement: and withall, that moſt diſhonourable departure of the <note n="*" place="margin">Barbatio.</note> Romane leader, much encreaſed their pride and ſtoutneſſe naturally in bred in them. Likewiſe it went worſe on the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes part by another meanes, and that upon ſuch an occaſion and occurrent as this. Two brethren there were of the bloud royall, who being faſt tied by vertue

of that peace which they had obtained from <hi>Constantius,</hi> durſt neither raiſe any uprore, nor ſo much as once ſtirre. But within a while after, when one of them, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Gundomadus,</hi> the greater perſon of the twaine, and more firme of his word, was by a traine murthered, all his people conſpired and banded with our enemies, and preſently withall the common ſort alſo of <hi>Vandomarius</hi> his ſubjects (as it was affirmed) joyned themſelves to the forces and regiments of the Barbarians that made warre.

From the top whereof, three horſemen of the enemies lying there in eſpiall, roſe up, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to give notice ſuddainely, that the Romane hoaſt was neere at hand, made haſt to their companie. But one footman, not able to follow, was taken by the quicke purſute of our men, who told us, That the Germanes for three dayes and three nights together paſſed over the river: whom, when our leaders eſpied hard by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunging themſelves thicke and cloſe together into ſquadrons, they made a ſtand, and ſtirred not a foot, whiles the <note n="*" place="margin">thoſe of the maine battaile.</note> Antepilani <hi rend="sup">i</hi>, the <note n="*" place="margin">Pikemen.</note> Haſtati and the formoſt of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ranke in the vaward ſtood firme and faſt, like a ſtrong and inſoluble wall: and with ſemblable warineſſe the enemies kept their ground, and made no haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And when (according as the foreſaid fugitive had told) they ſaw all the Cavallerie on the right ſide oppoſite unto them, the very flower of their horſemen they beſtowed thicke thronged together in the left wing; and among them here and there they entermingled skirmiſhers and footmen lightly appointed. For well they wiſt, That an horſeman of theirs (though a skilfull ſouldior otherwiſe) figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with our man of armes in complete harneis, whiles he holdeth his ſhield and reines of the bridle, by ſhaking and caſting his ſpeare with one hand, can doe no hurt unto a warriour hidden wholly under an yron armour of proofe: but that a footman in the very point and heights of dangers (when no man is wont to take heed of aught but that which commeth in his way and encountereth him) as he creepeth cloſe to the ground, by digging into the horſe ſide is able to throw the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der over his horſe head, ere he be aware, and then may he with ſmall adoe be killed. Having marſhalled the matter thus, the right ſide of the battaile they flanked and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14644:39"/>
made ſure with ſecret and blind ambuſhments. Now, the chiefe leaders of all theſe warlike and fierce nations were <hi>Chonodomarius</hi> and <hi>Serapio,</hi> in higher place of power and authoritie than the other kings. And <hi>Chonodomarius</hi> verily, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous fire-brand of the whole warre, with a flame-colour wreath or taſſell fitted to his creſt, advaunced before, and led the left wing (a man bold, and truſting upon his wonderfull ſtrength of bone and brawne) where the heat of battaile was loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, mounted on high upon a luſtie frothing courſer, bearing with him a great breadth, and bigneſſe of bulke, with his launce in reſt, and that of a terrible big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, all bravely to be ſeene in glittering armor, both an hardie ſouldior aforetime, and alſo a good leader above all others. But the right ſide was conducted by <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi> even then a luſtie gallant, with tender downe growing on his cheekes, but for action more forward than his yeares, the ſonne of <hi>Chonodomarius</hi> his brother, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericus,</hi> a moſt perfidious wretch all his life time; ſo called, for that his father, kept as an hoſtage or pledge a long time in Gaule, and having learned certaine hidden Greeke myſteries, changed the name of this ſonne of his (who originally at the firſt was cleped <hi>Agenarichus)</hi> into <hi>Serapio.</hi> After theſe followed kings or poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, next in power unto them, in number five, and princes of the bloud royall tenne: alſo a great traine and ranke of nobles, with five and thirtie thouſand figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men all armed, levied out of ſundry nations, partly for wages, and partly upon covenant and agreement to have the like ſervice tendered unto them againe.

Which beeing knowne, <hi>Chonodomarius</hi> quickly alighted from his beaſt on foot, and the reſt following his example without delay did the ſame: for there was not any one of them made doubt that their ſide ſhould win the day. When as the ſignall therefore of battaile was by ſound of trumpets ſolemnely given, they encountred one another with great violence. Then were the darts and arrowes diſcharged &amp; ſeene flying in the aire: and the Germans running with more haſt than good ſpeed, &amp; drawing weapons with their right hands, with hideous gnaſhing of their teeth flew upon the troups of our horſemen: and as they fared and raged above their wonted manner, their long ſhag haire made a terrible ſight, and from their very eyes a certaine furie ſparkled foorth: againſt whome the [Romane] reſolute ſouldiors covering their heads by putting their ſhields be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene, what with holding out their ſwords, and what with brandiſhing their darts threatening death, greatly terrified them. And whiles at the very point of the medley on both ſides, the horſemen ſtrongly entrouped themſelves, and the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſtoutly fortified their owne ſides, making a front by joyning their bucklers moſt cloſe and faſt together, there were raiſed up clouds of thicke duſt: much run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there was, and traverſing of the ground betweene them divers waies, whiles our men one while made head, and another while gave ground: and ſome of the Barbarians (as moſt skilfull warriours) ſtriving to oppoſe and ſet their knees forward, laboured hard to repell the enemie. But ſuch was the exceeding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of them on both ſides, that preſently they came to handie ſtrokes, and their buckler pykes thruſt one another; ſo that the skie rang againe with the lowd voyces, as well of them that ſhouted, as thoſe that were feld and readie to die. And when our left wing advauncing forward ſtill with full pace, had by maine force driven from them ſo many bands and companies of the Germanes, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hard upon them, and with a great noiſe in angrie mood charged upon the

Barbarians, our horſemen which kept the right wing, in great diſarray beyond all expectation left the battaile: and whiles the formoſt of them that fled hindered the hindmoſt, ſo ſoone as they were within the protection of the legions boſome, they ſtayed and renewed the fight againe. Now, this fortuned upon this occaſion, that whiles the broken rankes and files were a ſetting againe in order, the men of armes in their complete harneis ſeeing their captaine lightly wounded, and one of their conſorts killed with the weightie armour of his horſe fallen upon his necke, ſlipped out of the way, and made ſhift every man as hee could: and with treading the footmen down, they had put all in rout, but that they, cloſe thronged together, and bearing one upon another, ſtood their ground ſure, and mooved not. When <hi>Caeſar</hi> therefore perceived a farre off, that the horſemen looked all about them, for nothing but how they might make meanes to eſcape by flight, he gallopped his horſe toward them, and like a barre in the way reſtrained them. Whom when they had taken knowledge of, by the purple enſigne of a dragon fitted to the top of a very high launce, as if it had beene the pendant ſlough of a ſerpent, a certaine Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune of one troupe ſtood ſtill, and being ſtrucken with feare, and looking pale up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter, rode backe againe to renew the battaile: and, as men love to doe in doubtfull caſes, <hi>Caeſar</hi> after a mild manner rebuking them: <hi>Whither goe wee backe</hi> (quoth he) <hi>most valiant ſouldiors? Know yee not, that flight (which never found ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) bewrayeth the folly of a vaine attempt? Returne we to our companie, to be partakers at leastwiſe hereafter of glorie, how ever we forſake them inconſiderately, whiles they are fighting for the Common-wealth.</hi> By theſe words which he ſpake with good reſpect, he brought them all backe againe to undergoe the offices of warfare, having fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed herein the example of old <hi>Sylla;</hi> who when he had brought forth his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into the field againſt <hi>Archelaus,</hi> a captaine under <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and was in a hote battaile wearied out and forſaken of all his ſouldiors, ran to the formoſt ranke in the vauntguard, caught up a banner, and when he had flung it to the other ſide againſt the enemies: <hi>Now goe your waies</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>you that were choſen to be my fellowes in all dangers, and to as many as ſhall aske you, Where I your Generall am left? anſwere thus, and faile not, He is left alone in Boeotia, fighting for all us with the ſpending of his owne bloud.</hi>

of both ſides, tooke away the eye-ſight, and cauſed them to run their armour and bodies one upon another. But the Barbarians without all order, what with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and what for anger, burnt like a flaming fire, and the cloſe jointed ſhield-fence which defended our men in manner of a roufe, they hacked and hewed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſtroke of the ſword. Which being knowne, the Batavi, together with their kings (a puiſſant and terrible troupe) ran in with ſpeed to helpe their fellowes, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to reſcue and deliver them (with the aſſiſtance of fortune) in that extremitie, compaſſed in, as they were, round about. But the Alemans, as they began fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fight, puffed and blowed hard, as if in ſome furious fit they would have utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed all that ſtood againſt them in their way: Yet gave not over the jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines and caſting-darts, yea, and the yron headed arrowes were let flye, although in cloſe fight alſo one weapon ſtrucke upon another, and the habergeons were cloven with ſwords; and ſuch as were wounded, before all their bloud was ſhed out, roſe up againe to doe ſome ſervice before they died, for they were after a ſort very even matched: the Alemans ſtrong and the taller; our ſouldiors by long experience and practiſe cunning: thoſe, fierce, fell, and turbulent; theſe, quiet and warie: the Romanes bold of heart and courageous, the other preſuming upon their mightie big bodies. Howbeit, otherwhiles the Romane with the weight of armour driven back, roſe up again: &amp; the Barbarian, when both his knees were wearied with ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and preſſing forward, bowing his left ham backe, would eaſe himſelfe, and lye cloſe behind, readie yet to give an aſſault upon his enemie; which is a token of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie and ſtiffe reſolution in the higheſt degree. And ſo there leapt foorth ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely a gallant troupe of the nobles, among whom the kings alſo fought, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the common ſort following after, before all other brake within the battaillons in the vantguard of our men, and ſo making themſelves way, came as farre as to the legion of the <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Primani, <note n="*" place="margin">the main battaile.</note> placed in the middeſt, which guard and ſtrength they uſe to call <hi>Castra Praetoria;</hi> where our ſouldiors thicker arranged in many rankes and files, and therefore in manner of towers ſtanding their ground firme and faſt, with greater courage fell to fight againe: and ſo carrying an heedfull eye, how to ward all venies, and covering themſelves cloſe in manner of a <hi rend="sup">m</hi> ſword-fencer, with their drawne ſwords ran their enemies into the ſides, where by reaſon of their hote and furious anger they lay moſt open. And the Barbarians againe, fully bent to ſpend their lives for to gaine victorie, aſſayed to leuſe our battaile ſo jointly knit together: but ſeeing a number lying dead in rewes all the way before them (whom the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes now, upon taking better heart unto them, had layed along) followed on (as many I meane as remained alive) in place of the ſlaine: and when they heard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a grone of thoſe that lay a dying in the place, for exceeding feare they were ſtricken aſtonied. Outwearied at laſt with ſo much painefull toile, their ſtrength ſerved them thenceforth onely to flye, and ſo by divers and ſundry lanes they made ſhift with all the ſpeed they could to get away; much like unto mariners, who make haſt from out of the middeſt of ſurging waves in a boiſterous tempeſt at ſea, to be caſt upon land which way ſoever the wind carrieth them. The Romanes then upon this victorie (a thing rather wiſhed than hoped for, as any man will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that was there preſent) worſhip the gracious power of God, ſo propice and mercifull unto them. Howbeit, our ſouldiors without all mercie ſlaſhing and hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them upon the backes as they fled, when otherwhiles, by reaſon their ſwords were bent and rebated, they had not wherewith to ſtrike any longer, thruſt the Barbarians to the very heart with their owne weapons: neither was there one of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14644:41"/>
them that for all this wounding ſatisfied his anger with bloudſhed, nor thought his right hand had ynough yet of ſlaughter, or for any humble entreatie and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication would take pitie and give over execution. Thus therefore lay a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie number of them thruſt through the bodie to death, craving none other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but quickly to bee diſpatched of their lives. Some halfe dead, when their breath began now to faile, ſought about yet with dying heavie eyes for meanes to live longer: others had their heads cut in manner quite off with huge wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, ſo as they hung downe, and had no more hold than by the very throats: a number of them in the mierie and ſlipperie ground chauncing to ſlide and fall downe in the bloud of their fellowes, although no weapon touched their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, were over-whelmed with the ſouldiors ruſhing and running over them by heapes, and ſo killed. The winners having got ſo good an hand of their enemies, yet preaſſed on ſtill more forcibly, ſo that the points and edges of their weapons waxed blunt and dull with ſtriking ſo thicke, and the bright helmets and ſhields together lay tumbled under their feet. The Barbarians at laſt ſeeing themſelves driven to this utmoſt extremitie, and that the heapes of dead carcaſſes roſe ſo high, that they ſtopped all paſſage out, ſought for the onely helpe that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, even of the river, which now ran hard at their backes. And becauſe our ſouldiors (running a great pace even under their armour) were not wearie, but preaſſed ſtill upon them as they fled, ſome of them ſuppoſing that by their skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſwimming they ſhould bee able to rid themſelves of all danger, committed their lives unto the waves of the river. In which regard, <hi>Caeſar</hi> together with the Tribunes and captaines, in a quicke fore-caſt, fore-ſeeing what dangers might enſue, cryed out after a rebuking manner, and gave ſtreight charge, That not one of our men, in hote purſute after the enemie, ſhould venture upon the ſtreame, ſo full it was of whirle-pits. Whereupon this order they tooke, that ſtanding upon the bankes of the river, with ſundry ſorts of darts and caſting-weapons they ſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Germanes: of whom, if any one happened by ſwift nimbleneſſe to get away from the deadly dint of ſhot, with the weight of his bodie thus plunged, he ſunke downe to the bottome of the river: and like as it is in a certaine Theatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſpectacle (where the hangings make ſhew of ſtrange wonders) a man might now without feare have ſeene many ſights: ſome, that could not skill of ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, to ſticke cloſe and take hold of them that were good and ſtout ſwimmers: others, to float aloft like logs of wood, when they had ſpent their ſtrength and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came faint: a ſort of them wound within the waves, and devoured with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſtreame, ſtriving (as it were) againſt them: and ſome againe carried upon their ſhields, declining by crooked turnings aſide the high ſurges of the mightie billowes readie to come full upon them, after many a perill paſſed gaine the banke on the further ſide.

And for that he could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goe into his owne territories without hee paſſed over Rhene, hee covered his face for feare of being knowne, and ſo faire and ſoftly retyred. Now, when hee drew neere unto the bankes of the river, going about a certaine ditch ſtanding full of mooriſh water, to ſee where he might paſſe over, he ventured upon it, and after his horſe had flounced &amp; floundered with his heeles in the ſoft and clammie mud, he got out of it at length: and ſtreightway, a fat corpulent and heavie man though he were, he recovered for his ſuccour a pretie hill hard by: and then, being known (for it could not bee concealed who hee was, the greatneſſe of his former eſtate ſo bewrayed him) ſtreightwaies, a cohort of horſemen with their Tribune riding as faſt as their wind would ſerve, after they had compaſſed with armed men the hill, all over-ſpred with woods, beſet it round about right warily, but durſt not breake in, for feare leaſt by ſome deceitfull ſtratageme and hidden ambuſh among the darke ſhadie boughes, they might be welcommed to their coſt. Which when the king ſaw, and how he was driven to the utmoſt extremitie of feare, foorth he went alone, and of his owne accord yeelded himſelfe. Now, thoſe of his traine and companie, to the number of two hundred, and three of his moſt inward friends, ſuppoſing it a foule ſhame for them to live after their king, or not to die in his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, if the caſe ſo required, delivered themſelves up to bee bound as priſoners. And as the manner naturally of theſe Barbarians is, to be humble in adverſitie, and of a contrarie humour in proſperitie, drawne he was as a vaſſale and ſervant to the will of another, with a pale looke and abaſhed, tongue-tied alſo and ſilent, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a conſcience guiltie of foule offences: a wonder how much changed and different from that man, who after cruell and wofull outrages inſulting over the aſhes and reliques of Gaule, threatened to do many and horrible miſchiefes. Theſe exploits thus by the favour of the God in heaven atchieved, at the end of the day, upon the ſound of retreat the moſt invincible ſouldiors were called back, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched neere unto the ſide of Rhene; where fortifying themſelves with a rampier (as it were) of many courſes of ſhields ſet together, they tooke their repaſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

After theſe and ſuch like exploits fortunatly performed, within the palace of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> ſome finding fault with <hi>Iulian</hi> (to give delight and contentment to the Emperour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) tearmed him <hi>Victoria,</hi> or <hi>Victorinus,</hi> becauſe that in modeſt wiſe making his relation, as often as he gave charge and commaund, he declared many times that he had vanquiſhed the Germanes. And in the heaping up of vaine commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and oſtentation of things ſeene openly ynough, they puffed up (as their uſuall manner was) the Emperour, of his owne nature too high minded, aſcribing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was in the world fortunatly exploited, unto his auſpicate direction and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie government. Wherefore, being lifted up on high with the glorious words of theſe flatterers, both then and thenceforth in his edicts that he publiſhed, full arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly he made many a lowd lye, writing ſometimes, that he alone (forſooth) when God wot he was not in the action at all, both fought the field and woon the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, yea, and raiſed kings of whole nations up on their feet againe, when they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly made ſupplication to him upon their knees: and if, for example ſake, ſome great captaine, even whiles himſelfe abode in Italie, had performed any valiant piece of ſervice then againſt the Perſians, he would ſend his letter dight with lawrell unto the armies lying in the provinces, without any mention made of the ſaid captaine in all that long tenor thereof ſignifying (and that with a moſt odious vaunting of himſelfe) how he perſonally fought in the vaward. Finally, there be yet extant his edicts in the publique records of the Emperours, truly engroſſed, telling memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reports, and exalting himſelfe up to the skie.

                  <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the very beginning of the night embarked in ſmall and ſwift pinnaces eight hundred ſouldiors, giving charge, that <note n="*" place="margin">I ſuſpect this place: For what might 20. effect? and what ſhould the reſt of the 800. doe the while?</note> twentie of them, after they had ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and made way up the river, ſhould ſet a land, and with ſword and fire deſtroy whatſoever they could meet withall. Thus order being given, at the very Sunne riſing, when the enemies were diſcovered upon the hill tops, hee led the ſouldiors now more cheerefull and forward up to the higher grounds: but finding none there (for the enemies imagining as much, were departed) behold forthwith they ſaw afarre off a mightie deale of ſmoke waulming up into the aire, declaring plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that our ſouldiors had broken into the enemies territories, and began to waſt and ſpoyle the ſame. This object daunted the courages of the Germanes very much, ſo that forſaking their ambuſhments, which along the narrow ſtraits and luiking places they had addreſſed againſt our men, they paſſed in all haſt over the river named <note n="*" place="margin">Mein.</note> Maenus to ſuccour their deere friends. For as it uſually falleth out in ſuch doubtfull times of trouble and danger, beeing affrighted on the one ſide with the ſuddaine rode of our horſemen, and on the other with the violent invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our other ſouldiors that came embarked thither, they (skilfull in the coaſts of the countrey) found ſpeedie meanes to get away and eſcape: upon whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, our ſouldiors marching on at libertie, rifled rich villages full of corne and cattell, making ſpare of none: and when they had fetched the inhabitants as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners out of their houſes (built ſomewhat curiouſly after the manner of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes) ſet fire thereupon, and burnt them downe to the ground. And thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving over-run the countrey for the ſpace by eſtimate of tenne myles, ſo that they were come neere unto a wood that carried an hideous and fearefull ſhew of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they ſtood lingering a long time, as being advertiſed by a fugitive, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in certaine hidden caves under the ground, and trenches running out many waies, there were a great number ſecretly beſtowed, readie to iſſue forth when they eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their opportunitie. Howbeit, they adventured all of them moſt boldly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch the place, and found the foot waies over-layed with holmes and aſhes cut downe, yea, and a mightie barricado made againſt them. And therefore mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching backe more warily, they perceived (and that with ſuch indignation and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as their hearts could hardly hold) that they could not goe forward beyond it, but by fetching long circuits and hard turnings about. Now, for as much as by reaſon of the rigorous and piercing aire they ſtrugled in vaine with moſt difficult extremities (for now was the Aequinox of the Autumne paſt, and in thoſe tracts both mountaines and champion plaines were covered with deepe ſnow) they tooke in hand a memorable piece of worke: And whiles there was no man to withſtand their enterpriſe, a certaine ſtrong fortreſſe (which being built upon the Alemans ground, <hi>Traian</hi> would have to beare his owne name, and had of late been very forcibly aſſaulted) was by them in haſtie manner ſuddainely repaired; where for the time were placed ſouldiors to defend the piece, and thither the victuals were conveied which they had gotten out of the very bowels and heart of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians countrey. Which preparation, when the enemies perceived ſo ſpeedily brought about for their deſtruction, fearing leaſt the thing indeed would come to paſſe and take effect, they aſſembled themſelves together in all haſt, and by way of prayer in moſt humble manner ſent their Orators and craved peace; which <hi>Caeſar</hi> (directed by all policie to take the ſureſt way, &amp; alledging very many motives that carried good probabilitie with them) graunted for tenne moneths; and namely making this account, as he was a prince of provident forecaſt, That thoſe holds and

Then <hi>Caeſar</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving performed theſe acts, returned to Paris, there to Winter. Now for that it was feared, that many nations would with greater force make head together, this well adviſed governour caſting how deceitfull the iſſues were of warres, was much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with huge heapes of care.

The citie <note n="*" place="margin">in Aegypt.</note> Thebes in auncient time built, famous for the ſumptuous and ſtately wall, as alſo for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie into it at an hundred gates, the firſt founders thereupon tearmed Hecatompy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los, after the denomination whereof there is a province at this day called Thebais. This citie, what time as Carthage began to ſpread her dominion farre, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian captaines by a ſuddaine and unexpected rode ſurpriſed and deſtroyed: and afterwards when it was reedified, <hi>Cambyſes</hi> that renowmed king of Perſia, a prince all the while he lived encroching upon the territories of other kings, and cruell withall, after he had broken into Aegypt, gave the attempt to aſſault it, that from thence he might carry away a mightie maſſe of riches and pillage, forbearing not ſo much as the temples and the gifts offered there unto the gods: who whiles he buſily beſtirred himſelfe among thoſe that fell to ſpoyle and ſaccage, chaunced by occaſion of his looſe and large garments that entangled him, to catch a fall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: with which ſuddaine and forcible fall, his owne <note n="*" place="margin">or Rapiar.</note> dagger that he wore cloſe unto his right thigh happened to bee unſheathed, and ſo dangerouſly to wound him, that he had like thereof to die. Long time after, <hi>Cornelius Gallus</hi> procurator of Aegypt, whiles <hi>Octavian</hi> was Emperour of Rome, pilled and beggered this citie, taking to his owne uſe the moſt part of the wealth thereof: and upon his returne home, when he was judicially accuſed for his robberie &amp; waſting of the province, fearing the nobilitie, unto whom the ſaid Emperour had committed this matter to be enquired into and examined, who alſo were highly offended and bitterly bent againſt him, he fell upon his owne ſword, and killed himſelfe. This is that <hi>Gallus</hi> the Poet, if I take not my marke amiſſe, whom <hi>Virgil</hi> bewailing after a ſort in the latter end of his Bucolickes, in a mild kind of verſe maketh a dittie of. In this citie among mightie great ciſternes, and ſundry huge maſſie pieces of worke, expreſſely reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the images of the Aegyptian gods, we ſaw many Obeliskes ſtanding, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lying along and broken, which the auncient kings, after they had in warre ſubdued other nations, or growne prowd of their proſperitie and high eſtate, hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the bowels of mountaines (which they ſtucke not to ſearch for, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the utmoſt inhabitants of the earth) erected on high, and in their religious devotion dedicated to the Gods in heaven. Now an Obeliske is a moſt hard and rough ſtone, broad beneath, and ſharpe above, riſing by little and little to a mightie height, and becauſe it might reſemble a ray or ſunne-beame, waxing ſmaller and ſmaller, it is with foure-faces brought up to a narrow top, and the ſame is ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed alſo artificially by the workemans hand. The infinite number of Characters and markes of ſundry ſhapes, tearmed Hieroglyphickes, which we behold cut eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where into it, the auncient authoritie of ſacred wiſedome from the very firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning hath ennobled. For they engraving many kinds of birds and wild beaſts, even thoſe of another world, by reaſon that the memoriall of their Emperors more

For the knowledge and skill whereof, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for the while in theſe two inſtances may ſerve. By a Vulture or Gripe they repreſent the vocable or name of Nature; becauſe our Naturaliſts do report, there can bee no males found among theſe foules: and by the forme of a Bee making honey, they ſhew a king, declaring by theſe ſignes, That in a ruler there ought to be with ſweetneſſe a ſting alſo growing: and of this kind there be a great number. And for that a ſort of flatterers, as the manner is, puffing up <hi>Constantius,</hi> buzzed this without all meaſure into his eares, That whereas <hi>Octavianus Auguſtus</hi> had tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated two Obeliskes from the citie <note n="*" place="margin">The citie of the Sunne, in which ſence it is at this day called Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed along the channell of Nilus, and landed at Alexandria, there was a ſhip of huge and ſtrange bigneſſe built, &amp; the ſame to be rowed with three hundred oares.

After all this, there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned onely the rearing thereof, which unneath or not at all was thought could bee effected: and after they had erected high poſts with danger ynough (a man that had beene there, would have thought he had ſeene a very wood of frames and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines) faſtened there were to them huge and long ropes, in manner of manifold threds or ſtrings ſpred ſo exceedingly thicke together, that they hid the very skie: whereto the maſſie ſtone it ſelfe with images portrayed in it, like ſo many letters written upon it, was bound, and by little and little ſtrained aloft and held in the aire betweene heaven and earth, and ſo hanging a long time, whiles many thouſands of men ſwung about and turned it round, as they would doe myll-ſtones, placed it was in the middeſt of the ſhew-place, and upon it a bowle or globe of braſſe ſet,

Vpon the <note n="*" place="margin">the 24 of Auguſt.</note> ninth day before the Calends of September, early in the morning by Sunne-riſing certaine thicke gatherings or globes of blacke clouds over caſt and darkened the face of the skie, which a little before was cleare and lightſome; whereby the bright ſhining of the Sunne was chaſed ſo away, that things neere at hand, or ſtanding hard by, could not be ſeene: and thus the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight being dazeled, a hideous bleakeneſſe of a thicke and mirke miſt ſettled upon the ground and over-ſpred it: then, as if the higheſt power of heaven diſcharged and ſhot off fatall and deadly thunderbolts, raiſing withall the winds from the principall points and poles of the world, there fell a mightie tempeſt of raging ſtormes; by the violent force whereof, the mountaines were ſo beaten upon, that they groned againe, and there was heard the craſhing noiſe of the ſea ſhore daſhed violently upon. After all this followed horrible whirlewinds and fierie impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, together with a fearefull trembling of the earth, which over-turned the citie and ſuburbes from the very foundations. And for that many houſes ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the riſing of hils were carried on end, one fell upon another, and all places clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered againe with the monſtrous noiſe of their ruines. Meane while the high and ſtately tops of buildings reſounded with the ſundry out-cries of thoſe that ſought for their wives, their children, and what neere kinsfolkes and deere friends belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto them. In the end, after the ſecond houre of the day, and long before the third, the aire now become faire and cleare, diſcovered all the wofull and deadly downefals that were hidden before. For behold, ſome folke thruſt and cruſhed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with an huge deale of rubbiſh falling upon them, were under the weight thereof preſſed to death: others, that ſtood up to their neckes buried (as it were) within heapes thereof, whereas they might have beene ſaved, if any had come to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:14644:47"/>
helpe them, for want of ſuccour periſhed: others againe ſtucke faſt, hanging at the ſharpe ends of timber-logs bearing out. With one blow were a number ſeene ſlaine, men and women but a little before, but then confuſed heapes of dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſes pell mell huddled together. Some there were, whom the finials of houſes leaning forward, bare up, otherwiſe unhurt, but that they were to die with anguiſh and hunger. Among whom, <hi>Ariſtaenetus</hi> (governing and taking charge as deputie lieutenant of that dioceſſe or province ſo affectionately loved, and which <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> in honour of his wife <hi>Euſebia</hi> had named <note n="*" place="margin">For ſo much doth <hi>Euſebia</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie in Greeke.</note> Pietatis) by this miſhap, after long dolour and paine yeelded up his vitall breath. Some, having their heads bruiſed and ſquized together, or their ſhoulders or legs ſevered from their bodies, lying thus in doubtfull plight betweene life and death, piteouſly crying for Gods ſake unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the ſame caſe, to helpe them, were quite forlorne and left unto themſelves. And verily, the greater part of ſacred churches and private houſes, yea, and of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo might have beene ſaved, had not the outrageous flames, diſperſed here and there for fiftie daies and nights together, burnt up and conſumed whatſoever was combuſtible. And now I thinke it a meet and convenient time to report as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Earthquakes what auncient writers have by way of conjecture collected: for, the hidden depth of the truth it ſelfe, not onely this vulgar ignorance of ours, but the very everlaſting wits alſo of naturall Philoſophers, after long ſtudie upon this point not yet exhauſt or worne out, could never reach unto. Whereupon provided it is both in the ceremoniall bookes and alſo in the rites under the ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall prieſts and their Colledges, That by naming one god for another (ſince unknowne it is which of them thus ſhaketh the earth) there bee no hainous ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale and damnable ſinne committed. But according to the Philoſophers opinions, among which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is much perplexed and troubled, theſe earthquakes fall out to be either within the ſmall caves of the earth, which we [in Greeke] call Syrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas, whiles with thicke and often beating the waters wave to and fro, and caſt up ſurges: or els verily, as <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> affirmeth, by reaſon of violent winds getting cloſe within the ground below; which when they happen to hit and beat upon the ſides thereof, hard baked or felted together, finding no way of iſſue, ſhake thoſe parts of the earth at which they entred when they were moiſt. Whence it is, that men obſerve for the moſt part, that during an Earthquake, we above the ground perceive no winds to blow, becauſe they are buſie in the moſt remote nookes of the earth beneath. <hi>Anaximander</hi> is of opinion, That the earth waxing drie upon a long and extraordinarie drought, or after much moiſt weather &amp; ſtore of raine, openeth very great chinkes and wide chawnes, at which the aire above with violence and in exceeding much quantitie entreth, and ſo by them ſhaken with a ſtrong ſpirit, is ſtirred and moved out of her proper place. For which cauſe, ſuch like terrible acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents chaunce either in exceſſive hote ſeaſons, or after immoderate fall of raine from heaven. And hence it is, that both auncient Poets and Theologers alſo have tearmed <hi>Neptune,</hi> who hath dominion over the moiſt elements, <note n="*" place="margin">

But, as diligent and conſiderate regard is the conquereſſe in manner of all difficulties, caſting many and ſundry things in his head, this was the only way he found, namely, without expecting the full ſeaſon of the yeare, to encounter the Barbarians before he was looked for. And in this ſetled reſolution he tooke corne for twentie daies (out of that ſtore which was provided to be ſpent in the ſtanding place of abode) baked throughly, for to laſt, into bisket bread, ſuch as commonly they call Buccellatum, and layed it upon his willing ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors ſhoulders: and ſo, confident of this helpe, in a good houre, as before, hee tooke his journey, thinking that within five or ſixe moneths two urgent and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie expeditions might be performed. Which things being put in a readineſſe, firſt of all others he marcheth againſt the Frankes; thoſe I meane who commonly are tearmed Salij, and who in old time durſt in the Romane ground, at a place called <note n="*" place="margin">Weſer.</note> Toxiandria, very boldly place and plant themſelves. Now when hee was come to <note n="*" place="margin">Tongeren.</note> Tungri, an embaſſage of the foreſaid people meeteth him, ſuppoſing the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was to be found ſtill in his Wintering harbour, pretending peace upon this condition, That no man might eyther provoke or moleſt them, whiles they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained quiet as in their owne territories. Theſe embaſſadours, after hee had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly digeſted and diſpoſed his affaire, and oppoſed certaine ambiguous and doubtfull conditions, as if he meant to ſtay in thoſe tracts untill their returne, he ſent away rewarded. No ſooner were they in their way homeward, but he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed hard upon them, ſending out the Generall <hi>Severus,</hi> and ſuddainely ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet upon them all along the rivage, he ſmote them, as it had beene a whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thunderbolt, or flaſh of lightening: And now when they fell to entreatie,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14644:48"/>
rather than to make reſiſtance, turning the effect of victorie to a commodious courſe of clemencie, upon the yeelding of themſelves, their riches, and children, he tooke them to mercie. The Chamavi likewiſe, who had given ſemblable attempts, he ſet upon, and with the ſame celeritie partly he put to the ſword, and partly, when they ſtoutly reſiſted and were taken alive, he hung yrons upon; others, that tooke them to their heeles, and fearefully in all haſt fled, he permitted for the while, to get away without hurt: unto whoſe embaſſadours, ſent afterward to make ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and to provide for their eſtates, lying humbly proſtrate upon the ground before his face and under his very eye, he graunted peace with this capitulation, to returne in ſafetie to their owne home. Thus when all things ſucceeded according to his hearts deſire, haſtening with moſt vigilant care to found by all means poſſible the good of the provinces, he thought (as the time would permit) to repaire three skonces or forts, ſituate directly in a rew upon the banke of the river Moſa, which lately had beene overthrowne by the obſtinate ſelfe-willed Barbarians: and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, omitting the warres for a ſmall time, reedified they were. And to the end, that the policie wiſely begun he might by quicke diſpatch make ſafe, out of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteene daies proviſion of corne which the ſouldiors as they marched forward in their expedition carried on their neckes, he defalked a portion, and layed up in the ſame holds; hoping, that ſo much as was taken from it might bee ſupplied out of the Chamavians corne fields. But it fell out farre otherwiſe: for, by reaſon that the ſtanding corne was not yet ripe, the ſouldiors having ſpent what they carried, and finding food in no place, fell to threatening tearmes in the higheſt degree, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked <hi>Iulian</hi> with foule names and opprobrious language, calling him a vaine Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian of Aſia, and a deceitfull, yea, and one that, under the ſhew of wiſedome and learning, was a very lob and foole: and, as uſually there be ſome found even among armed ſouldiors, that have readie and rolling tongues of their owne above their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, they ſtucke not to mumble many of theſe and ſuch like ſpeeches: <hi>Whither are we drawne without all hope of better? in times paſt verily we endured hard travaile and moſt irkeſome to be abidden even through ſnowes and the pinching cold of bitter froſts: but now, ô ſhamefull indignitie, when we are upon the point finally to vanquiſh and defeat our enemies, readie we be to pine away and conſume for very famine, the moſt inglorious and baſe kind of death that is. And that no man may thinke us to be mutineus and given to raiſe commotions, we proteſt, that it is for our life onely that we ſpeake, cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither gold nor ſilver, which long agoe we might not have, nor ſo much as once ſee; ſo denied it was us, as if we had been convicted to have undertaken ſo many toilefull paines and perils even againſt the State and Commonweale.</hi> And to ſay a truth, good reaſon they had thus to complaine: For among ſo many courſes of probable or allowable matters, and doubtfull points of neceſſitie, the ſouldiors out-toyled and ſpent with the painefull ſervices of Gaule, had gotten neither <hi rend="sup">e</hi> donative nor wages, ſince time that <hi>Iulian</hi> was thither ſent: for that neither himſelfe could come by aught to give, nor <hi>Conſtantius</hi> after the wonted manner permitted any ſuch allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to be beſtowed. And hence it appeared plainely, that this was done upon fraudulent malice rather than nigardize; becauſe, when the ſaid <hi>Caeſar</hi> had given a ſmall matter of no value to a certaine common ſouldior, asking ſomewhat accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his need to goe unto the barber for to be trimmed, he was for it with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious tearmes traduced and backbitten by <hi>Gaudentius</hi> then Notarie, who had abode long in Gaule to ſpie into his proceedings; whom afterwards himſelfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to be put to death, as ſhall be ſhewed in place convenient. At length, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14644:49"/>
the mutinie was appeaſed, not without ſundrie ſorts of faire words and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſpeeches; and when by meanes of a bridge made of ſhips joyned together, he had paſſed over the Rhene, and ſet foot in the Alemans countries, <hi>Severus</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the horſemen, who aforetime had beene a warlike and induſtrious cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, all on a ſuddaine became lither and heartleſſe. And he that oftentimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged both all and ſome to fight courageouſly, now ſeemed a contemptible and timorous diſſuader of battaile, haply for feare of death ſo neere at hand: like as we read in the bookes of <hi>Tages</hi> the Tuſcane, that they who are within a while to be ſmitten with the lightening of <hi>Veiovis</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">f</hi>, are ſo dulled in their ſences, that they can heare neither thunder nor any great noiſe whatſoever. And contrarie to his wonted manner, hee marched in his journey lazily, inſomuch as hee terrified, by threatening death, the guides that led the way apace and luſtily before, unleſſe they all with one accord would agree and avouch, that they were altogether ignorant of the waies: who fearing the authoritie of this prohibition, went no where, after that, one foot forward.</p>

And verily, hee obtained the ſame with pardon graunted for all that was paſt, under this condition, That he ſhould redeliver our men that were captives, and find the ſouldiors food, ſo oft as was needfull, after the manner of baſe vaſſales received to mercie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, taking onely ſecuritie of life for whatſoever he brought in: which if hee ſhewed not as time and occaſion required, he might well know he was to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried againe therewith.

Which being knowne, <hi>Iulian</hi> was provoked to juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation: inſomuch, as when he the ſaid king came, as the manner is, to have a gift beſtowed upon him, foure of his followers that accompanied him, in whoſe aſſiſtance and fidelitie he had moſt affiance, he would not diſmiſſe, before that all the captives were returned. Howbeit, being by <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſent for to a conference and parle, whom he adored with trembling eyes, and even overcome againe with the ſight of the conqueror, he was driven to an hard exigent and condition; namely this, That for as much as it was meet &amp; requiſit after ſo many proſperous atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that thoſe cities alſo which the Barbarians had forcibly raſed and deſtroied, ſhould be reedified, he at the charges of himſelfe and his people muſt find cariage, timber &amp;c. for the building. Which after he had promiſed to doe, and withall wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, if he dealt any way diſloyally, to make ſatisfaction with the loſſe of his heart bloud, he was permitted to returne home. As for the tranſporting thither of corne and victuals, he might not bee compelled thereto, as <hi>Suomarius</hi> was, becauſe his countrey being ſo utterly waſted, he could meet with nothing therein to give. Thus theſe kings, that in times paſt ſwelled ſo outragiouſly in pride, and were accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to enrich themſelves with the ſpoyle of our men, became now tame, &amp; yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their neckes under the yoke of the Romanes power: and as if they had beene borne and bred among Tributaries, willingly obeyed their commandement. Theſe affaires in this wiſe atchieved, the ſouldiors were beſtowed in ſundry ſtations, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> retyred himſelfe to his wonted wintering place.</p>

And no ſooner had he a ſight of the Emperour, but preſently he flung away his weapons, and fell grovelong flat upon his breaſt, in manner breathleſſe, and not able to take his wind: and having for very feare loſt the uſe of his tongue, even when he ſhould have made his petition, thereby he moved the greater pitie. Now, after he had aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſundry times to ſpeake, permitted he was with ſobbing (which ſomewhat hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his ſpeech) to utter as well as he could what he requeſted. At length, after he was refreſhed, and bidden to ariſe upon his knees, having now recovered his voice, he humbly beſought forgiveneſſe and pardon for his treſpaſſes. Thither alſo was the multitude admitted to make their ſupplications; who for very feare could not open their mouths, for that as yet the better perſon among them ſtood in doubtfull tearmes of danger: but when he was commaunded once to raiſe himſelfe from the ground, and had given unto them a ſigne which they long waited for, to make their petition, they all caſt from them their targuets and weapons, and wholly gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to humble prayers, deviſing many meanes and geſtures how to exceed the ſaid prince in lowly ſupplication. This <hi>Zizais,</hi> beeing the greater potentate, had (with the reſt of the armed men) brought alſo with him other pettie princes, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Rumon, Zinafer,</hi> and <hi>Fragiledus,</hi> and many lords beſide of the nobilitie, to tender the like petitions upon hope to ſpeed: who albeit they rejoyced highly for their lives graunted, and promiſed to undergoe the heavie load of hard conditions, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence and to make amends for hoſtile hurts and outrages committed, yea, and willingly to preſent themſelves, their goods, children, and wives, together with the whole circuit of their territories and poſſeſſions under the power of the Romanes; yet courteſie and bountie joyned with equitie prevailed and tooke place: ſo that being willed, without feare to hold ſtill their owne habitations, they rendred up all the captives they had of our men. They brought in alſo their hoſtages according as they were enjoyned, and promiſed moſt readily from thenceforth to obey what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they were commaunded. This example of clemencie gave encouragement likewiſe to others; inſomuch, as there came in ſpeedily together with all their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Arabarius</hi> and <hi>Vſafer,</hi> princes of the bloud royall, among the lords and poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of eminent place, leaders of the Gentile regiments: the one of them ruled part of the Quadi, inhabiting beyond the mountaines; the other, certaine of the Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matians; both, in regard of their countries ſo neere confining, and their ſutable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vageneſſe, ſorting moſt joyntly together. The multitude of their people the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſuffered not to aproch, leaſt under a pretence of making ſome league, they might ſuddainely take them to armes. Thus when the companie was parted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, thoſe that came to entreat in the behalfe of the Sarmatians, were willed for a ſmall time to withdraw themſelves out of the way, whiles the buſineſſe of <hi>Araba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>

Theſe matters thus according to equitie and reaſon concluded, <hi>Vſafer</hi> was admitted to deliver his requeſt, whiles <hi>Arabarius</hi> ſtiffely ſtood upon theſe tearmes, and affirmed, That the peace which himſelfe had obtained, ought to ſtand him alſo in ſtead, as beeing partner with him, although in an inferiour degree, and wonted to obey his commaundements.

And in like ſort, they alſo, having obtained peace, which they deſired, brought in ſooner than a man would have thought, their ſons by way of hoſtages, whom they ſent for out of the inmoſt parts of the kingdome.

And theſe Barbarians, as they were overthrowne and felled to the ground, ſuch was their invincible contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie and wilfulneſſe, ſhewed by the horrible gnaſhing noiſe which they made, that they grieved not ſo much at their owne death, as at our mens joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And beſide thoſe that were ſtarke dead, a number of them having their ham ſtrings cut, and thereby deſtitute of all meanes to flye, ſome with their right hands cut off, others againe unwounded verily, but cruſhed and ſqueezed under the weight of thoſe that went over them, endured dolorous torments, without one word or grone given: neither was there one of them, who among thoſe ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſorts of execution either craved mercie, or flung his weapon from him, or deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14644:53"/>
quicke diſpatch by preſent death; but holding their weapons continually, thus piteouſly afflicted though they were, eſteemed it a leſſe fault to be overcome by the gorce of others, than convicted by the doome of their owne knowledge and conſcience: yea, and they were heard otherwhiles grumbling and mumbling theſe words; <hi>That it was long of Fortune and not of thdir deſert, that this befell unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Thus in the ſpace of one halfe houre was the trhall of this battaile diſpatched, and ſo many Barbarians lay dead at once upon the ground, as that it was the victorie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and nothing elſe which ſhewed there had bedne a field fought. Scarcely were yet theſe hoſtile nations defeated, when the neere kinsfolke and deere friends of them that were ſlaine, of both ſexes and all ages one with another, were brought forth in routs and companies, plucked out of their poore and low cottages: who abandoning the pride of their former life, fell to the moſt humble and ſervile obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiouſneſſe that might be. And thus againe within the compaſſe of a very ſmall time, a man might ſee whole heapes of bodies ſlaine, and flockes of poore captives. Whiles this heat therefore of fighting, and the gaine withall of conquering pricked our men ſtill forward, they roſe up all at once, intending the deſtruction of thoſe that either forſooke the field, or lay cloſe hidden within their cottages. When our ſouldiors therefore, thirſting ſtill after the bloud of Barbarians, were come to the places where they kept, downe they went with the light thatch, and hewed the men in pieces: neither was there any one of them, whom his cabbin, were it never ſo ſurely framed of ſtrong timber-peeces, ſaved from danger of death. Finally, when as all was on a light fire, that none could lurke or lye hid any longer, now that all meanes of ſaving life were cut off, every one either periſhed obſtinately conſumed with fire, or avoiding the fire, if he went forth of dores, whiles he ſought to decline that one kind of death, fell upon the enemies ſword, and ſo was ſlaine. Yet ſome there were of them, who eſcaping both weapon and fire, as generall as it was, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves to the ſtreame of the river running hard by, in hope by skill in ſwimming to gaine the banke on the farther ſide: of whom, the moſt part ſunke under the waves, and periſhed; ſome were ſhot in with arrowes, and ſo loſt their lives; inſomuch, as with abundance of bloud there ſhed, the ſtreame of the river fomed and ſwelled againe. Thus by both elements, the armed anger and valour of the winners, made cleane worke and riddance of all. Decreed then it was, after this order taken aforeſaid, That generally throughout, they ſhould all looſe both hope and comfort of life: and ſo, after their houſes burnt, and whole families caried away, commaundement was given, That veſſels ſhould be gotten together, to ſearch out thoſe whom the farther banke of the river had ſevered from our armie: and foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, leaſt the courage of the warriours ſhould abate or wax coole, certaine nimble and lightly appointed skirmiſhers were put in boats, who being guided along the ſecret coaſts of the countrey, met with all the lurking holes of the Sarmatians: who at the ſuddaine ſight of them were deceived, namely, ſeeing them to be their owne countrey wherries and rowers whom they knew. But when by the glittering of the weapons afarre off, they perceived that was comming toward them which they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they betooke themſelves for refuge and ſafetie to their mooriſh and fennie grounds, whom the ſouldiors followed the more maliciouſly: and having killed the moſt of them, found a victorie there, where a man would have verily thought, they neither could keepe ſure footing, nor would adventure upon any ſervice.</p>

In the end, the counſell of their elders prevailed ſo much, and the conſideration withall of ſo many and ſundry victories, that they tooke the courſe to yeeld themſelves. They alſo came in and joined with them in humble ſupplication, who by force of armes had uſurped libertie: and the reſidue likewiſe of them (deſpiſing now ſuch maſters as had bin overcome, &amp; were unmeet for warre, ſeeing the mightier in place) with humble praiers ſubmitted their necks to the yoke. The more part of them therefore, after they had received a ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct, and forſaken the ſtrong defence &amp; bulwarke of the mountaines, ſped them apace to the Romanes campe over the ſpacious and wide champian fields, together with their parents, wives, and children, as alſo with that pelfe which their quicke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture permitted them to ſteale away.

Our enemies in their furious rage, and upon a vanitie of ſwelling pride, deſpiſing us in our abſence, whiles we were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the defence of Italy and Gaule, over-ran Illyricum at their pleaſure: and in ſundry rodes that they made to and fro, waſted the frontiers of our limits: one while in hollowed troughes of oake, otherwhiles on foot paſsing over rivers: not by way of conflict in open field, nor uſing the meanes of armour and fine force; but like, as their uſe hath alwaies bin, after the manner of ſecret brigands and robbers, for their craftie guile and varietie of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull mockeries ever from the firſt beginning of their nation dread even unto our old an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors. What diſpleaſures were by them done tollerable, we ſuffered, as being in perſon farre removed, ſuppoſing that lighter loſſes by the effectuall ſervice of our captaines might be forfended. But when through their licentiouſneſſe they proceeded further, and grew to worke many miſchiefes and the utter undoing of whole provinces; after we had fortified and made ſure the avenues into Rhaetia, and by a moſt vigilant guard firmely founded the ſecuritie of Gaule, leaving no cauſe of terror and feare behind us at our backes, we came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Pannonia, to the pleaſure of eternall God, purpoſing to ſtrengthen whatſoever was like to run to ruine and decay. And when all things were prepared accordingly, as yee know, in the middle of Spring we went in hand with moſt weightie and important affaires. Firſt, that when we were about to frame a bridge cloſe ioynted, no voleyes of ſhot might impeach us: which worke being with ſmall ado finiſhed, after we had ſeene and overrun our enemies lands; the Sarmatians, who ſtubbornely in a wilfull mind went about to withſtand us unto death, we overthrew and ſubdued without any loſſe of our owne men. The Quadi alſo in ſemblable malapartnes, whiles they came to aid the Sarmatians, and fell upon the ſquadrons of our noble legions, we hewedin pieces: who after miſerable damages ſustained, having found by experience in all their braving rodes and minatorie attempts of reſiſtance, of what force our valour was, did caſt away all fence of armour; and thoſe hands which they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and fitted for fight, they carried pinnioned behind at their backes: and ſeeing no other meanes to ſave their lives but in prayer and petition, they fell proſtrate at the foot of a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Emperour, whoſe battails they had often found to have come unto afortunat end. After</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:14644:54"/>
                  <hi>theſe were ſequeſtred and ſet aſide, with like valour we vanquiſhed the Limigantes alſo: and when a number of them were ſlaine, the others to avoid the danger were driven to flye for refuge unto their ſtarting holes among the blind mariſhes. And when theſe exploits were likewiſe brought to an happie concluſion, the time was come when we were to uſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable mildneſſe and clemencie. The Limigantes we forced to flit into places farre remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for feare they might any more beſtirre themſelves to doe our men miſchiefe, and most of them we ſpared. Over thoſe that were free, we ſet as ruler</hi> Zizais, <hi>who was to be devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and faithfull afterward unto us, reputing it a greater matter to create, than to preſent unto the Barbarians a king: and this honor added much unto the ſolemnitie of his creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he was appointed unto the ſame people a ruler, who had before time elected and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted him. A foure-fold reward therefore, which one expedition hath performed, we have acquired and the Common-wealth together: firſt, by working due revenge upon hurtfull and miſchievous robbers; and after by taking of our enemies ſo many priſoners as may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie you abundantly. For with thoſe things ought vertue and proweſſe to ſtand contented, which it hath woon by painefull ſweat and ſtrong hand: as for our ſelves, our owne tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes and fortitude will be ſure to ſave for us much wealth and ample riches, which are great treaſures, even the patrimonies of all men whole and ſound. For this is it that beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the mind of a good prince; this ſuiteth well with proſperous ſucceſſes. Finally, I my ſelfe alſo carrie before me the ſpoile of our enemies name, even the addition in my ſtyle of</hi> Secundus Sarmaticus: <hi>which yee all with one accord, without arrogancie be it ſpoken, have worthily and for deſert conferred upon me.</hi> After this ſpeech ended, the whole aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly with more than wonted alacritie, as having their hope of greater matters and gaine bettered, by way of joyfull applauſe and feſtivall acclamations roſe up, to reſound the praiſes of their Emperor: and at laſt, after open declaration made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the maner, That <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was invincible, repaired with joy unto their pavilions. And the Emperour being brought backe unto his pallace, and refreſhed with two daies repoſe, returned with triumphant pompe to Sirmium: the militarie bands and companies alſo, retyred to their appointed places of abode. In theſe very daies, <hi>Proſper, Spectatus,</hi> and <hi>Euſtachius,</hi> ſent as embaſſadours unto the Perſians, as I have ſhewed before, went unto the king, being returned to Cteſiphon, producing the Emperors letters and preſents, and they demanded (as things then ſtood whole and ſound) a peace: and mindfull of their commiſſion and what directions they had in charge, they never left the due regard of the good and majeſtie of the Romane Empire, avouching boldly, that the covenant of amitie was to be eſtabliſhed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, but with this condition, That there ſhould be no motion at all made of troubling the ſtate of Armenia and Meſopotamia. When therefore they had ſtaied there a long time, ſeeing the king moſt obſtinately ſet and hardened againſt the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of any peace, unleſſe the Seignorie of theſe countries were awarded unto him; they returned without effecting their buſineſſe.

And albeit there be many commendable examples of his, in ſuch like controverſies, yet it ſhall ſuffice to put downe but one, to the patterne or likeneſſe whereof his other deeds or ſayings are to bee conſidered. <hi>Numerius,</hi> ruler but a while before of Narbonenſis [Gallia] being accuſed for theft, he heard after an unuſuall cenſorious rigour openly at the barre before his Tribunall, and admitted to the audience of his triall whoſoever were willing to bee there: who when he pleaded unguiltie, and put by all matters objected againſt him, by a bare deniall, and could not in any one point be convinced; <hi>Delphidius</hi> a moſt ſharpe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour, who layd ſore againſt him, for want of proofes and evidences, in a great chafe cried out: <hi>Who can ever be found guiltie, ô most noble and renowmed</hi> Caeſar, <hi>in caſe it ſhall be ſufficient to denie?</hi> Whereat <hi>Iulian</hi> being mooved, wiſely replied thus <hi>ex tempore: And who</hi> (quoth he) <hi>can be unguiltie, if it will ſuffice to have accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?</hi> Theſe verily were his ſpeeches, and many ſuch in civile matters.

certaine territories of the Alemans harboured in their hearts hoſtilitie, and would both dare and doe many outrages, unleſſe they alſo, after the examples of others, were overthrowne, he ſtucke perplexed and doubtfull, with what forces, or with what expedition (ſo ſoone as in reaſon he might have fit oportunitie) by preventing all rumor of his comming, he ſhould be able on a ſuddaine to invade their lands. Now as he caſt about and thought upon many and ſundry waies, hee reſolved at length to aſſay that which prooved in the iſſue and effect thereof expedient.

Theſe being gotten together, when it was farre in the night, and all of them going aboord (whom fortie ſmall pinnaces or barges, even as many as were then at hand, received) were willed to row along the river, with ſilence, ſo as their very oares ſhould hold off, or give a light ſtroke, for feare that the noiſe of the waves might raiſe the Barbarians; and ſo with readie minds and active bodies they breake through the frontier bankes over-againſt them, whiles the enemies were amuſed on the fires that our men made. Meane while that theſe things were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forward with all ſpeed, <hi>Hortarius,</hi> a king made before hand our confederate, not minding to alter aught otherwiſe than the tenour of the covenants went; but withall, a friend unto his neighbour-borderers, having invited and aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the kings, princes of the bloud, lords and potentates to a feaſt, kept them with him at good cheare, which (according to the manner of the countrey) held unto the third <note n="*" place="margin">midnight.</note> watch of the night: whom, as they departed from him, our men aforeſaid by chaunce ſet upon at unawares, but by no meanes could either kill or catch them, by reaſon of the darkneſſe, and their ſwift horſes withall, which carried them quite away, whither in that doubtfull braid they were driven. As for all their lacquies and ſervants that followed them on foot, they ſlew, unleſſe they were ſuch as the obſcuritie of the time ſaved from danger. At the length, when it was knowne that the Romanes had paſſed over (the kings, who both then, as alſo in the time of expeditions paſt, ſuppoſed there to take ſome eaſement of their labors, when it happened that they found enemies) were ſtrucken and aſtenied; their people alſo,

who watched the bridge with great care and diligence, that it ſhould not be made, quaking for very feare, betooke them to their heeles: and thus the unbridled furie of theirs aſſuaged, they made what haſt they could to remoove their neereſt and deereſt friends farther off. Then preſently, when all this difficultie was paſt, the bridge being ſet together, and the projects of theſe ſo carefull nations prevented, our ſouldiors ſeene now in the Barbarians land, paſſed through the dominions of <hi>Hortarius,</hi> without doing any hurt. But when they were come once into the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of thoſe kings, who were yet enemies, without any feare they made foule worke throughout the middeſt of the rebels countrey, burning and ſpoyling all before them. Now, after they had ſet on a light fire the mounds and fences of their brittle houſes, hewed in pieces a number of folke, and ſeene many of them falling downe, and others making ſupplication; when they came ſo farre as to a countrey named Capellatij, or Palas, where certaine mere ſtones parted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines betweene the Alemans and Burgundians, there they encamped, for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that <hi>Macrianus</hi> and <hi>Hariobaudus,</hi> brethren, Germanes and Kings, might bee received without dread: who perceiving that their deſtruction drew neere, came with carefull and heavie hearts to entreat for peace. After whom immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired king <hi>Vadomarius</hi> alſo, whoſe habitation was juſt againſt the Rauraci, and through the commendatorie letters of prince <note n="*" place="margin">Whether now Emperour, or his grandfather, it is uncertaine.</note> 
                  <hi>Conſtantius</hi> ſecretly brought out, and earneſtly alledged, he was gently entertained; as who long ſince had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the protection of the Romane Empire. And <hi>Macrianus</hi> verily, with his brother, admitted among the Eagles and Enſignes, wondered at the varietie and braverie of the armour and forces, which then and never before he ſaw, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated in the behalfe of his people.

In concluſion, after long conſultation had, and all things well weighed and conſidered, unto <hi>Macrianus</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and <hi>Hariobaudus</hi> peace was graunted: but as for <hi>Vadomarius,</hi> who intending to eſtabliſh his owne ſecuritie firme and ſure, was come alſo by way of embaſſage, and as an Oratour, in the behalfe of <hi>Vrius, Vrſicinus</hi> and <hi>Verſalpus</hi> kings, heartily deſiring peace, he could not in this meane time ſuddainely have his anſwere, for feare leaſt (as theſe Barbarians are fickle and hardly to bee truſted) they bethin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and remembring themſelves, after the departure of our men would not ſtand to thoſe points which by others had beene obtained. But when they alſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, upon the fiering of their ſtanding corne and houſes, upon the taking alſo of many of them priſoners, and killing a number, made ſuch humble ſuit, as if they likewiſe had treſpaſſed in the ſame kind againſt our people, they got peace with the ſemblable conditions: among which, this was above all moſt inſtantly urged, That they ſhould redeliver all thoſe captives, whome in many out-rodes they had taken and carried away.</p>

In the houſe of <hi>Barbatio,</hi> then colonell of the Infante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, it happened that a ſwarme of Bees were evidently ſeene to ſettle: And when he carefully ſought unto wiſards, skilfull in prodigies about ſo ſtrange a ſight, this anſwere they made, That it portended unto him ſome great danger; grounding (forſooth) upon this conjecture, That theſe flying creatures, after they have made their habitations, and gathered goods, are driven out from thence with ſmoke and the troubleſome ringing of cymbals. This <hi>Barbatio</hi> had a wife named <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> a dame of no few words, nor yet wiſe: who, when her husband was gone foorth to the warres, and fearefully perplexed many waies, in regard of that which he well remembred had beene fore-told him by the ſaid Soothſaiers, moved like a woman with a fooliſh toy that tooke her in the head, called for her maid ſervant, who could skill of cyphring, and one whom ſhe had gotten from out of the patrimonie and goods of <hi>Silvanus;</hi> by whoſe hand ſhe wrote a letter full untowardly and out of ſeaſon unto her husband, weeping, as it were, and beſeeching him for Gods ſake, That after the death of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> now at hand, himſelfe (as ſhe hoped) being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the imperiall place, would not caſt her off, and preferre the marriage of <hi>Euſebia</hi> the Queene, a ladie for perſon and beautie ſurpaſſing. This letter was ſent as ſecretly as might be: and the maid ſervant, who had penned the ſame as her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe endited it, after that every man was returned home from the warre-ſervice, ſtole out in the beginning of night, and ran away to <hi>Arbetio,</hi> taking with her a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie of the ſaid letter; and being heartily welcome unto him, diſcloſed that piece of written paper. He then, as he was the fitteſt man in the world to frame an accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt one, truſting upon this preſumption and evidence, enformed the prince of this matter: and, as the uſuall manner was, without any delay or pauſe allowed to the handling of this buſineſſe, <hi>Barbatio</hi> after he had confeſſed the receit of ſuch a letter, and the woman his wife by good proofe was convicted to have <note n="*" place="margin">or cauſed the ſome to be written</note> written the ſame, loſt their heads for it. When theſe were executed, much inquiſition was made abroad, &amp; many men were troubled, aſwel the innocent as offendors: among whom, <hi>Valentine</hi> alſo, late principall or captaine of the Protectores, and now Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune, with many others, after he had beene tortured divers times, as one privie to the foreſaid treaſon, ſurvived notwithſtanding, and in very truth knew nothing at all of the matter.

Now, this <hi>Barbatio</hi> aboveſaid was a man ſomewhat rude and arrogant withall in his carriage: in this regard alſo many hated him; for that both whiles hee had the rule of the Protectores in ordinarie under <hi>Gallus Caeſar,</hi> hee played the perfidious traitor: and alſo after his deceaſe, bearing himſelfe prowd of his advauncement to an higher place of warre-ſervice, he deviſed and plotted the like againſt <hi>Iulianus Caeſar</hi> and oftentimes (a thing that good men deteſted) he whiſpered in the open eares of the Emperour many ſhrewd and grievous matters: ignorant as hee was of that wiſe

For when a wing of our enemies horſemen followed after, one <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digidus</hi> a Tribune, as he fled with his camp-ſlave, and having overtaken the ſaid ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant (now that his maſter was by flight ſlipt away) had asked him (as I paſſed in great haſt by) Who was appointed to be the Iudge or Governour? and heard how <hi>Vrſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus,</hi> who a little before had entred the citie, was going toward the mountain Izal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, and therewith ſlaine the partie, who anſwered them to a thing that they never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, a number there were which purſued us in hote chaſe, and never reſted: whom after I had out-ſtript (ſuch was the fleet pace of my horſe under mee) and found our men laid ſecurely along at their eaſe hard by Amudum, a weake hold, whiles their horſes were ſcattered here and there about at their forage, I ſtretched forth mine arme at length, and ſwinging the skirt of my caſſocke on high, round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my head, by this uſuall ſigne ſhewed, That the enemies were at hand: and ſo joyning with them, rode amaine, with my horſe readie by this time to tyre.

This ſtratageme therefore was deviſed, namely to ſet upon an horſe backe a burning lampe, and to tie the ſame faſt about him, for falling, and ſo to let him (as he caried the ſame) go looſe by himſelfe without a rider, and take the left hand way, whiles we in the meane time marched toward the mountaine tops ſituate on the right: to this end, that the Perſians wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it to be a tallow linke giving light before the captaine ſoftly marching, might take their courſe that way eſpecially: which if wee had not fore-ſeene, wee ſhould have beene taken priſoners, and brought in ſubjection to our enemies.

And within a while after, when we were (as hath beene ſaid) upon our journey to Samoſata, and went forward while it was yet twy-light, from a certaine high Barbican or Toot-hill, we (ſuddainely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted at the bright ſhining of glittering armour, and crying out alowd, That the enemies were hard at hand) after the accuſtomed ſignall of battaile given, made a ſtand, and caſtour ſelves into a round ring, as thinking it our ſafeſt way, neither to flye (our enemies being now within ſight to follow in chaſe) nor to joyne battaile with them (more mightier than wee both in horſemen and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber otherwiſe) for feare of certaine death.

And verily on the South ſide watered it is beneath with the curving ſtreame of Tigris that ariſeth neere unto it: what way it ſtandeth againſt the Eaſt wind, it hath for proſpect underneath, the plaines of Meſopotamia: where it is expoſed to the North, and hath the river <note n="*" place="margin">or Nymphius.</note> Nympheus neighbouring thereto, ſhaddowed it is with the tops of the mountaine Taurus, which divide the nations beyond Tygris and Armenia aſunder: as it is oppoſite to the Weſt wind, it joyneth upon Guma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, a fruitfull countrey in cattell, and for tillage as plentifull; wherein ſtandeth a village named Abarne, well knowne for the naturall hote bathes of medicinable and holeſome waters.

his journey toward the right hand from a place called Bebaſes (according as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus</hi> had given counſell) by the way of Horte, Meiacarire, and Charcha, as if he would paſſe by Amida, when hee was come neere unto certaine fortreſſes of the Romanes, whereof the one had to name Reman, the other Buſan, learned by the relation and intelligence given of certain fugitives, that many mens wealth and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches was thither brought, &amp; kept ſafe thereas in holds ſeated very high &amp; ſure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. They ſaid alſo, That together with houſe-hold goods of great price there was found there a beautifull dame, and her daughter a little one: the wife that ladie was of one <hi>Craugaſius</hi> a Niſibene, a man of bourgeſſe degree, for birth, reputation, and power of good regard and eſteeme. The king therefore in a greedie deſire to catch hold of other mens goods, maketh haſt, and confidently aſſayleth the ſayd holds: whereupon the defendants in a ſuddaine amazedneſſe of mind, as beeing affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſight of ſuch varietie of armour and weapons, betrayed all thoſe that fled thither for ſuccour and defence: and when thoſe had commaundement to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, they preſently rendered up the keyes of the gates. Thus when the entries were laid open, whatſoever had bene beſtowed there, was taken forth: and the ſilly women aſtonied at the noiſe then made, were brought out, yea, and the babes in their mothers armes claſping cloſe unto them, put to the experience (poore wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) in the very beginning of their tender yeares, of grievous miſeries and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Now, when as the king by enquiring and demaunding whoſe wife the dame aforeſaid was, had found that <hi>Craugaſius</hi> was her husband, he permitted her, fearing that ſome violence ſhould be offered unto her perſon, confidently to come neere unto him: and when hee had ſeene her all covered over with a blacke veile, ſaving onely her very lips, he right courteouſly confirmed and ſettled her now in a more aſſured hope of recovering her husband, and the ſafe keeping withall of her hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie undefiled. For, hearing that her husband was wonderfully enamoured of her, he ſuppoſed verily, that by this price and beneficiall reward hee might bee able to purchaſe the betraying of Niſibis. And yet there were found other virgines alſo there, which according to the Chriſtian Religion were conſecrated unto the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, whom he commanded to be kept untouched, and to performe their religious ſervice after their wonted manner, without impeachment of any perſon whatſoever.

Now, when the day-light firſt appeared, all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey over, as farre as could be ſeene, ſhone againe with glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring armour and weapons, and the men of armes with their bard horſes all in complete harneis, covered both hill and dale. Himſelfe mounted upon a courſer, and higher than the reſt, advaunced before the whole armie, wearing in lieu of a diademe the reſemblance of a rams head of gold, ſet with precious ſtones, all goodly to be ſeene aloft, accompanied with a traine of many high perſonages in honourable place, and of divers and ſundrie nations. And for certaine it was knowne, that he meant by way of parley onely and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſound the defendants of the wals, as haſtening by the advice of <hi>Antoninus</hi> another way. But the heavenly power, to conclude the miſeries of the whole em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Rome within the compaſſe of one region, reſtrained and curbed him, as he infinitely bare himſelfe aloft, and weened verily, that upon the very ſight of him all the beſieged would ſtreightwaies for feare become heartleſſe, and fall in humble manner to entreatie. Before the gates he rode braving up and downe, accompanied with the guard of his royall band: and whiles he over-boldly engageth himſelfe ſo neere, as that his very viſage might openly be knowne, a faire marke he was, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his goodly ornaments, to be ſhot at with arrowes &amp; other caſting-weapons; whereby he had ſurely beene overthrowne and layed along, but that through the duſt that aroſe from the archers and darters, they loſt the ſight of him: and ſo with the rent of a part of his garment by the ſhot of a barbed-headed javelin he gat away and eſcaped to do afterwards an infinit deale of miſchiefe. Hereupon raging againſt them no leſſe, than if they had beene ſacrilegious ſpoylers of ſome holy temple, and giving it out, That the lord of ſo many kings and nations was violated; hee
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14644:64"/>
made great preparation, and mightily endevoured utterly to raſe and deſtroy the citie: And when his chiefe and principall captaines beſought him, that by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thus into an exceſſive fit of choler, he would not give over and leave his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious-begun enterpriſes, being with their moſt mild petition pacified, he decreed, That the morrow alſo the defendants might bee ſummoned to ſurrender. And therefore, at the firſt breaking of the day, <hi>Grumbates</hi> king of the Chionites, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his diligent ſervice in this behalfe, boldly approched the walls, having a ſtrong guard about him of right expert and nimble ſervitours: who was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner eſpied (comming now within the reach of a dart ſhot) by a moſt skilfull ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher that had a very good eye, but bending his croſſe-bow, hee levelled at his ſonne in the very prime of his youthfull yeares as he ſtood cloſe to his fathers ſide, pierced his curace, and ſhot him through breaſt and all: a gallant gentleman, for talneſſe of perſonage and goodly preſence ſurmounting all his equals in age. At whoſe fall, his countreymen ſlipped away every one, and fled: but returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none againe upon good reaſon and due conſideration, leaſt he ſhould be harried away, they ſtrucke up the al'arme, and rayſed together a number of nations with their diſſonant out-cries: by whoſe concourſe and encounter, whiles the darts flew to and fro as thicke as hayle, there was a cruell fight: and after deadly skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, which laſted to the end of the day, when as now it grew to be night, the corpes with much adoe protected, hardly by the miſt and darkneſſe of the night was gotten out among heapes of ſlaine bodies and ſtreames running downe of bloud: much like, as when at Troy in times paſt there was a right hote and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die conflict about the breathleſſe bodie of <hi>[Patroclus]</hi> companion to the Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian leader <hi>[Achilles.]</hi> By occaſion of this death, the kings houſe was heavie and ſad, and for that all the lords and nobles, together with the father, were ſtrucken with this ſuddaine loſſe, after proclamation of a vacation made, the young prince (commendable for his nobilitie of birth, and well beloved) was ſolemnely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayled and mourned for, after the guiſe of his owne nation. Being therefore car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out all armed, as he uſed to bee, placed he was upon a certaine large and high rayſed terrace or ſcaffold, and about him tenne little beds were ſpread, carrying the images of dead men, ſo curiouſly dreſſed and embaulmed, as that the very por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits were like unto bodies new enterred. And thus for the ſpace of ſeven dayes together, all the men verily by bands and companies kept good cheare, and with dauncing and ſinging certaine mournefull kinds of dumpes and ſorrowfull dities, bewayled the death of the young prince: but the women with wofull knocking of their breaſts and ſhedding teares after their wonted manner, piteouſly cried and lamented for the hope of their nation, thus untimely cut off in the very prime and flower of his age: like for all the world to thoſe women prieſts and worſhippers of <hi>Venus,</hi> that are oftentimes ſeene to weepe in the ordinarie feaſts and ſolemnities of <hi rend="sup">a</hi>

And after two daies reſt given, and a great number ſent out to waſt the rich and well husbanded fields lying open after the manner of peace, the citie was environed about with a five-fold ranke and courſe of ſhields: and upon the third day betimes in the morning, the glittering troupes ſtanding round in plumps, tooke up all the ground, ſo farre as a man was able to looke and ſee from him: and the rankes marching with a ſoft and gentle pace, held their places divided by lot unto them. All the Perſians inveſted the circuit of the wals: that part which loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Eaſtward, fell to the Chionites, which was the quarter where the young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, to the mortall miſchiefe of us, was ſlaine: the Vertae were appointed to the South ſide, the Albanes kept the North tract, and againſt the Weſt gate were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Segeſtans, the fierceſt warriors of all others: with whom the Elephants making a loftie ſhew, and terrible to behold, for their bodies full of wrinckles, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their ground ſoftly, as being loaden with armed men: and as wee have often ſaid, for dreadfull ſight exceeding all other foule ſpectacles whatſoever. Beholding then ſo infinite a number ſought out a long time to ſet on fire the Romane world, and wholly bent to worke our deſtruction, in full diſpaire of any ſafetie, we tooke care from thence-forth to end our lives with glorie, the onely thing now that wee all wiſhed for. Well, from the Sunne-riſing to the end of the day ſtood their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taillons in array, as fixed faſt in the ground, and never ſtirred, not ſo much as once ſhifting foot, without any noiſe at all, or neighing of horſes heard; and in the ſame manner retyred they as they came: but after they had refreſhed themſelves with meat and ſleepe, before the night was fully paſt, with the ſound of trumpets lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the way, they beſet the citie round about, and gave ſo terrible an aſſault unto it, as if within a while it would have fallen. Scarcely had <hi>Grumbates</hi> there, like an herault at armes, launced (after his owne countrey faſhion and our manner alſo) his ſpeare died all red in bloud, but the whole armie with a clattering noiſe of weapons mounteth up to the wals, and ſtreight way beginneth a hote and lamentable fight, whiles on the one ſide theſe by whole troupes run on violently, and with all reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and alacritie bend themſelves to the aſſault: and cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>iwiſe on the other, our men were as eager and forward to encounter and receive them. Therefore it came to paſſe, that huge ſtones throwne out of <note n="*" place="margin">Engins ſo called.</note> Scorpions, brake many of our enemies heads in pieces, and brained them: ſome were ſhot through with arrowes, part of them having barbed darts and javelines ſticking in them, lay wounded and beſpred the ground: others ran away and fled as faſt as they could toward their fellowes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Neither was there within the citie leſſe weeping and wayling, or fewer ſorts of death: whiles many a cloud of arrowes flying thicke together, with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of them ſhaddowed and darkened the ayre; whiles alſo the engines of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14644:65"/>
and artillerie, which the Perſians were poſſeſſed of ſince the ſacking of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara, did much hurt, and inflicted many wounds. For the defendants gathering their ſtrength together, and falling afreſh to fight againe by turnes, after they had given over for a time, in their exceeding heat of defending the towne being mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally hurt, fell downe dead, or after they were torne and mangled, with their tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling over-turned thoſe that ſtood next them: or at leaſtwiſe, whiles they were yet alive, ſought about for them that had the skill to draw foorth the arrow and dart heads that ſtucke faſt in their bodies. Thus theſe ſlaughters happening one in the necke of another, and continuing unto the very latter end of the day, the very dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the evening had not ſlacked, by reaſon that on both parts they were ſo ſtiffely ſet to fight to the outrance. After that the watch therefore was kept by thoſe that were heavily armed and weaponed, the hils of the one ſide reſounded againe with the cries that were ſet up, whiles our men extolled the vertues of <hi>Constantius Caeſar,</hi> as the ſoveraigne Emperour and Lord of the world: and the Perſians for their part ſtyled <hi>Sapor</hi> both <hi>Achaemenes</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> which by way of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation import as much, as commaunder of kings, and conquerour of warres. And before the day began to peepe, upon the ſignall given by trumpets, ineſtimable numbers of forces were raiſed from all ſides, and flocked in manner of ſo many fowles to the like hote skirmiſhes as before, and every way both farre and wide, as a mans eye could reach before him, the fields and dales made no ſhew of any thing but the glittering harneis and brandiſhing weapons of ſavage nations: and within a while, upon ſetting up a mightie ſhout and out-crie, as they ran all raſhly foorth, a huge deale of caſting-weapons flew from the wals: and, as we might well thinke, none were diſcharged in vaine, falling as they did amongſt a number of men that ſtood ſo thicke together. For, conſidering we were beſet round with ſo many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, we bore our ſelves in fight right fiercely, not becauſe we would ſave our lives, as I ſaid, but for that wee deſired to die manfully: and from the beginning of day untill twy-light in the evening, the victorie ſwayed to no ſide; but ſtill there was fighting on all hands more fiercely than adviſedly: For there aroſe hideous out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries of one terrifying and frighting another; ſo that for heat of courage hardly could any man ſtand his ground, without receiving ſome hurt or other. And at length, as the night made an end of ſlaughtering, ſo the ſatietie of painefull travails yeelded to both parts a longer reſpite and ceſſation of fight. For, when as wee had time given to reſt, that little ſtrength which remained in us, continuall labour and want of ſleepe conſumed quite: and withall, the bloudſhed upon the ground, and the wan faces of them that lay a dying, made us exceedingly afraid: and verily the narrow and ſtreight rowme within the circuit of the citie, which was none, ywis, of the greateſt, would not permit ſo much as the laſt comforts yet, of burying the dead, conſidering that there were encloſed within the ſame, legions, and a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſort of ſtrangers and citizens one with another of both ſexes; beſides ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther few ſouldiors raiſed, to the number in all of twentie thouſand. Well, every man cured his owne wounds, according as they were curable, or could meet with leeches ynow to looke unto them; conſidering, that ſome were ſo grievouſly wounded, that with the ſpending of their bloud to the laſt drop, they gave up their vitall ſpirits, ſtrugling ſtill for life: others being ſtabbed into the bodie with ſharpe pointed weapons, lay along on the earth, and when they had given their laſt gaſps, were throwne forth dead.

Which projects of his, <hi>Sabinianus</hi> ſtood againſt, as hurtfull and dangerous; pretending verily in ſhew, the Emperors letters openly giving commaundement, That what ſervice ſoever might bee done, ſhould be performed every where, without hurt or touch of ſouldior: but ſecretly in the bottome of his heart root retaining that which he was charged many a time in the court to doe, namely to diſappoint his <note n="*" place="margin">Vrſicinus.</note> predeceſſor, ſo much inflamed with the love and deſire of glorie, of all meanes and occaſions to win honour, though the ſame might tend to the benefit of the State; ſuch haſt was made even with the utter deſtruction of the provinces, that this warlike <note n="*" place="margin">Vrſicinus.</note> knight might not be reported the author or copartener of any memorable exploit. And therefore, much abaſhed and diſmayed with theſe hard fortunes, as booting nought by ſending ſpies often unto us, although the wayes were layed ſo by ſtreight watch and ward, that hard it was for any man to enter into the towne: and gaining as little by deviſing many good and profitable courſes, he reſembled for all the world a Lyon, for big bodie and grim looke terrible, but not daring to goe and deliver out of danger his whelps encloſed within net and toyle, as having his clawes taken from him, and loſt his teeth.

the gates were lockt Faſt up, and they for all the entreatie that their Tribunes made, might not iſſue forth, they fretted &amp; gnaſhed their teeth like wild beaſts. But certain daies after, their valor &amp; effectual ſervice was ſeene above all others, as I wil declare. In a by-place or corner of the South part of the wall which looketh downe to the river Tigris, there ſtood a tower riſing to a great height, under which certaine crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and broken rocks lay gaping open, ſo that a man could not looke downe into them without horrible dizzines and turning of the braine: from whence by vaults hollowed under the ground along the foot of the mountain, certaine ſtaires work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly and finely poliſhed, led unto the very plaine plot of the citie, whereby to the end that water might privily and by ſtealth be drawne out of the rivers chanell, a deuiſe that we haue ſeene in all the forts and ſtrong holds throughout thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which lie hard to rivers. Through this darke angle not regarded by reaſon of the broken rocke, with the guidance of a certaine towneſ-man fugitive, who had revolted to the contrary ſide, ſeventie Perſians, archers, choſen out of the kings regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, very cunning and bold withall, guarded with the ſilence of that remote and by-place afore-ſaid, ſodainely at midnight climbed one by one up to the third ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or loft of the above ſaid tower: and when they had lien there cloſe hidden, in the morning they put out a ſoldiers coat of a red colour, which was a ſignall or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to begin battaile: which done, when they perceived once that the citie was invironed round on every ſide, with forces that flowed like waves upon it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had emptied their quivers, and caſt them at their feet, with clamorous yellings and ſhouts they ſet all on fire, beſtowing their arrowes abroad right cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly. And then anon all the armie in thicke ſet ſquadrons aſſailed the citie much more eagerly than before. Whiles we within were uncertaine &amp; doubtfull which way to turne us, and to make head; againſt theſe that ſtood aboue and moleſted us, or againſt the multitude, that by skaling were already at hand to take hold upon the very bulwarks? thus was the ſervice devided among us. Five of the lighter kind of baliſts were removed out of their owne places, and planted againſt the tower: the which diſcharging verie quickly wodden darts, otherwhiles pierced through two of them at once. Some of them heereupon greevouſlie wounded fell downe: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for feare of the engines making ſuch a noiſe, were caſt headlong, and ſo with their bodies ſore mangled, died: which being diſpatched with great celeritie and expedition, and the ſaid engines brought backe againe to their wonted places, with ſomewhat better ſecuritie we ran on all hands to the defence of the walls. And for that the wicked act of this fugitive encreaſed our ſoldiers trouble and care, as if they were encountring in the verie plaine, they beſtirred their ſtrong armes ſo luſtily in diſcharging divers ſort of caſting-weapons, that the Vertae, who were quartered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the South-ſide, now repulſed and ſet backe with many a ſmart wound, and weeping for the death of many their fellowes, retyred in feare unto their tents.

And like as ſavage beaſts with keene and fell teeth kept up in grated cages, and made more fierce and cruell with their foule and filthie keeping, upon hope to get out, ruſh and bounce againſt the barres that turne and wind within their ſockets: even ſo fell they to hewing and hacking with their ſwords the gates, which (as I ſaid before) were kept locked, as wonderfully troubled in mind, leaſt either when the citie was raſed and deſtroyed, they alſo ſhould periſh, without the atchievement of ſome brave and glorious exploit: or if it happened to be delivered from dangers, they might be reported to have done no worthie and memorable act beſeeming the magnanimitie of the Gaules: albeit before time, when they had often iſſued foorth, and attempted to impeach the pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as well caſters up of bankes, as makers of plat-formes, yea, and killed ſome, themſelves received the like at their hands. We then deſtitute altogether of good counſell, and doubting what wee ſhould ſet againſt them in their way, raging in this wiſe as they did, at length made choice of this courſe above the reſt, although themſelves would hardly yeeld their aſſent unto it, namely, that ſeeing they could no longer be endured, after ſome ſhort pauſe and ſtay made, they might bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſet upon the watch and ward of the enemies, that were placed not farre out of the darts ſhot, to the end, that when they had broken through them, they might proceed on ſtill further.

and ſuch as would beare the greateſt weight that might be of defendors. Meane while, the Gaules impatient of all delayes, armed with axes and ſwords, went out at a poſterne gate ſet open for them, taking the vantage of a darke night, when the Moone was in the change, praying unto the heavenly power to bee good and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable unto them, and withall holding their very wind as they went: now when they drew neere, all in a thicke plumpe they ran violently, and after they had ſlaine ſome of the ſtanding warders, killing alſo the utmoſt watch of the campe (as who fearing no ſuch matter, lay ſound aſleepe) they thought and fully purpoſed ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them, if they had good lucke, and ſped any thing well, ſuddainely to come upon the king himſelfe, and to ſurpriſe him. But their ſleepe being broken with hearing the noiſe of them that fell downe, and the groning of ſuch as were ſlaine, a number of the enemies were raiſed, and when every man for his part cried, Arme, Arme, theſe venturous ſouldiors ſtood ſtill and ſtirred not a foot, as not daring to paſſe on further: for it was no point of warie policie, ſince thoſe were awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned whom they layd in wait for, to run raſhly upon an open hazard. Now when as whole companies of Perſians fuming and fretting on every ſide, came hotely ſet to fight, the Gaules on the other ſide with ſtrong bodies and undaunted bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo long as they could hold out, ſlaſhed and hewed all them with their ſwords that ſtood in their way, and ſome of their owne ſide were either beaten downe or ſhot into the bodie, with a number of arrowes flying about their eares on every hand. When they perceived therefore all the danger bent amaine to one place, and whole ſquadrons of their enemies running toward them, they made haſt to get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and yet not one of them turned his backe: and ſo being driven without the rampier, retyring by little and little, as it were, by ſound of the meaſures, when they could no longer endure the bands ſo thicke aſſayling them, with the noyſe of the trumpets from the campe they were ſore troubled, and ſo departed: alſo while many trumpets and cornets reſounded out of the citie, the gates were ſet open to receive our men, if happily they could poſſibly returne ſo farre; yea, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of artillerie kept a great ratling, without ſhot of any dart: to the end that both the captaines of the ſtations and wards, after their fellowes were ſlaine, might be driven to goe behind, as not knowing that they ſtood againſt the naked wals of the citie, and that thoſe hardie and valiant men might bee received without taking harme.

After this, theſe nations (ſore troubled and made more wood with ſo new and ſtrange an accident) ſetting aſide all further trifling and delay, thought good now to trie the quarrell by raiſing maine fabrickes and other fortifications, ſince that fine force ſped no better: and thus in the heat of their bloud, meaning to put the matter to the extremitie of warres, they all haſtened now either to die with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or elſe to make ſatisfaction unto the ghoſts of them that were ſlaine, with the downefall and utter ruine of the citie. And now by this time, when they had on all hands with alacritie and cheerefulneſſe finiſhed their furniture and preparation accordingly, no ſooner was the day ſtarre up, but ſundrie ſorts of fabrickes and turrets, bound with yron barres, were ſet cloſe to the wals: in the high tops where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were baliſts fitly placed, which removed the defendants that kept lower. And by that time it grew to be faire day-light, the skie all over was under-ſpread with a ſeeling, as it were, of yron harneis; and the battaillons thicke ſet together, marched, not out of ranke diſorderly, as before, but directed by the mild ſound of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, without any of them running raſhly forth of their array, covered all the while with roofes or pent houſes over their heads, and having before them wicker hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles made of rods for a fence. And when they drew ſo neere, as that they were within dart-ſhot, the Perſian footmen, for all they held their ſhields before them, unneth avoiding the arrowes ſhot from the wals out of brakes, croſſe-bowes, and other engines, diſplayed and opened their rankes wider: and for as much as there was no kind in manner of caſting-weapons that did light in vaine, even thoſe that came heavily armed at all pieces, were daunted, and by their reculing made our men the bolder and more courageous. Howbeit, becauſe our enemies Baliſts, planted upon their yron-bound turrets, beeing of force from above to annoy and diſpleaſe whatſoever was ſomewhat under them, as the place was unequall; ſo the effect and event was unlike, whereby they made foule bloudſhed among us. Now when the evening came on apace, ſo that both ſides reſted, the greater part of the night was ſpent in deviſing what meanes might meet with ſo horrible a miſchiefe. And in the end, after we had caſt and projected many wayes, we reſolved upon this device, which by putting quickly into execution, proved the ſafer, namely, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe baliſts aforeſaid foure ſcorpions ſhould be planted full affront. Which while they were removed and placed over-againſt them warily (a matter of great difficultie and skill) the day commeth, to us moſt wofull, ſhewing the dreadfull

bands of the Perſians, with whole heards and troupes of Elephants joyning cloſe unto them, which made ſuch a braying noiſe, and their bodies withall carried ſo huge a boulke, as a mans mind cannot conceive a more terrible and fearefull ſight. And when we were on al ſides put to it, what with violent weapons, huge fabricks, and hideous beaſts, by the meanes of our Scorpions <note n="*" place="margin">or Sockets.</note> yron ſlings, round ſtones dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven otherwhiles from out of the bulwarkes, brake the joynts of their turrets, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew both the Baliſts &amp; their benders ſo headlong, that ſome without wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurts; others, cruſhed with huge and heavie weights, periſhed; and the Elephants with great violence were ſet further off: which beaſts beeing on all ſides encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with flames of fire throwne among them, that had now taken hold of their bodies, and going thereupon backward, their maſters could not hold: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when the munitions and fabrickes were burnt, they skirmiſhed yet ſtill, and gave not over. For, the king himſelfe of the Perſians, who is never forced to bee perſonally in any battaile, ſore moved with theſe tempeſtuous infortunities, after a new manner, never exampled or knowne before, like unto a ſouldior that is uſed to fight a field, leapt forth into the thickeſt of them: and becauſe he was more goodly and brave to be ſeene of them that looked a farre off, than the other multitude of ſuch as guarded and protected him, many a caſting-dart was throwne at him: and when a number of the guard and ſquires of his bodie were layed along, hee went cleere away, changing alternatively by turnes the battaillons eaſie to be ruled: and to the very end of the day, not affrighted with the fearefull ſight either of thoſe that were a dying, or of wounds given and taken, at length he permitted ſome ſmal time to be graunted for reſt. But when the night came and ended the conflict, and that in ſo ſmall a time he had taken a ſhort ſleepe, no ſooner grew it to be day-light, but he boyling with anger and dolour, and minding to ſet no regard of right before his eyes, excited his people againſt us, for to win what he hoped for. And when after their fabrickes and plat-formes were burnt, as I have ſhewed, they attempted to fight along the high terraces next unto the walls: out of the mounts raiſed up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in forth, our men, ſo farre as they were able to doe or ſtraine, with equall force reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted on the high ground. And a long time continued there a bloudie battaile, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for feare of death ſtirred one man of any ſide, nor gave over his endevour, to make good their places. The conflict being drawne out and continued thus farre, when the fortune of the ſides was ruled by an inevitable event, that mount or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race of ours that had coſt ſo long labour about it, as if it had been ſhaken with ſome earthquake, fell downe forward: and the ſpace that lay hollow and gaped between the wall and the heape of earth caſt up withoutforth, layed now even and plaine, as it were, by a cauſey or bridge ſet over it, made an open paſſage and entrance for the enemies, and the ſame by no barres in the way impeached: and ſo the moſt part of our ſouldiors that were thus caſt down, ceaſed their fight, either over-whel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with earth, or weakened with travaile. Howbeit, there was running on all ſides to put backe ſo ſuddaine a danger, and whiles with haſt making they entangled one another, the enemies grew the bolder and more venturous for their good ſucceſſe.</p>

Wherefore, when it began to be darke in the evening, and as yet a number of our men (though adverſe fortune ſtood and ſtrived againſt them) by joyning in fight were held occupied, and had their hands full, I (with two others) lying hidden through the benefit of the darke night, in a certaine ſecret place of the towne, got forth at a poſterne gate, where there was no watch kept: and having ſome helpe by the skill I had of deſart places and the ſwift ſpeed that my companions made, came at length as farre as to a ſtation or baiting place at ten myles end: wherein after we had beene moderately refreſhed, and were about to goe forward ſtill on ourway, and my ſelfe was now over-come with too much travaile, as a gentleman not uſed to ſuch toyle, I found a terrible object to ſee to, but yet that which to me (ſo weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and tyred out as I was) yeelded paſſing great comfort. One of theſe campe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacqueyes or ſouldiors pages riding upon a ſwift horſe without ſaddle and bitt or bridle, to the end that he might not drop off his backe, tied very ſtreight and ſhort unto his left hand the halter or cord, wherewith, as the manner is, he was uſed to be led and guided: and within a while after chauncing to bee caſt, and not able to breake in ſunder the knot of the bond that held him faſt, had all his lims piteouſly rent and mangled, as he was dragged through deſart wilds and forreſts, and ſo with the weight of his carkaſſe reſtrained backe the beaſt, which by this time alſo was ſpent and tyred out with running. The ſervice of which jade thus caught, I ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of for the time, came with much adoe together with the ſaid companions of mine, to certaine fountaines of waters naturally hote, ſtanding upon a veine of brimſtone. And for that by reaſon of the hote weather we being over-taken with drought and thirſt, went ſoftly ſeeking a great while for water, and ſo ſpied at length a verie deepe pit, not able either to go downe into it for the depth it carried, nor having any cords or ropes about us, wee being taught by extreame neceſſitie what to doe in this caſe, did cut the linnen ſhirts that we were lapped in, into ſmall pieces: whereof having drawne out a rope of a mightie length, we tooke a quilt which one of our companie wore under his morrion, and put the ſame to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of it: which being by the ſaid rope let downe into the pit, and drinking in water like a ſpunge or diſhclout, quickly quenched the thirſt wherewith wee were in manner conſumed. From thence we went apace unto the river Euphrates,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:14644:70"/>
minding to croſſe the water unto the further banke, by a veſſell which a long time was wont to give attendance therein that tract, for to ferrie over both horſe and man. But behold, wee might diſcover a farre off a regiment of Romanes, with their horſemens guidons diſranked and broken, which a multitude of Perſians purſued; and we wiſt not whence it was, that in ſo ſuddaine violence they charged thus the backes of the other, marching on their way. By which example, thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to our eyes, we beleeve verily, That thoſe earth-begotten gyants aroſe not out of the bowels and boſomes of the earth, but were borne indeed ſo exceeding ſwift: whom, for that they were ſeene ſuddainly in divers places (Sparti common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they tearmed them) men ſuppoſed to have ſtarted out of the ground, ſo fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly doth antiquitie extoll this thing, as above all others beſide. This unhappie occurrent made us beſtirre our ſtumpes, and for that all the helpe wee had to ſave our ſelves, lay in ſwift footmanſhip, wee made ſpeed through greves and groves toward the high mountaines, and ſo from thence wee came to Melitina, a towne in the leſſe Armenia: and there having met with our captaine, wee accompanied him, now readie to take his journey, and viſited Antiochia againe. Meane while, <hi>Sapor</hi> and the Perſians, becauſe they might not now march into the inland parts of the countrey, conſidering it grew toward the end of Autumne, and the ſtarre named the Kids, were riſen, driving their captives and other booties before them, intended to returne home into their owne countrey.

Caſting therefore and providing for her owne good, and farre forecaſting accidents to come, troubled ſhee was with a twofold thought, as one deteſting both widowhood and wedlocke. Whereupon ſhe ſecretly diſpatched a very tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie familiar friend of hers, and one that knew well all the coaſts and quarters of Meſopotamia, with direction to enter into Niſibis by the mountaine Zagrus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two garriſon fortreſſes, Miride and Lorne; requeſting her husband by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall meſſage and ſome ſecret tokens of matters privily paſſed between them twain,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14644:70"/>
That after he was enformed what occurrents had happened, he would come over, to live with her a bleſſed life. With theſe inſtructions this paſſenger beeing to his content furniſhed, and withall lightly appointed, through blind wayes in forreſts and ſhrubbie places he hieth apace, and entreth into Niſibis: where he pretended this to be his errand, namely, That for as much as his miſtreſſe was no where to be ſeene, and peradventure murthered, hee having eſpied meanes to make an eſcape, departed out of the enemies campe. And ſo being not regarded, as one that was but a baſe fellow, he enformed <hi>Craugaſius</hi> of all that had beene done: and ſoone after, having taken his faithfull promiſe, That if he might with ſafetie, he would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his wife; the meſſenger gat away from thence, glad man that he was, bringing unto the woman newes that ſhe ſo long wiſhed for. Who knowing thus much, by the mediation of Marqueſſe <hi>Sapor</hi> made a ſupplication to the king, That before he departed out of the Romane marches, hee would (if it might conveniently bee done) of his gracious favour graunt and commaund, That her husband might come under his power and protection. Now when the ſaid ſtranger, ſo ſuddainly come, was as ſoone gone before any man looked for it (for indeed he preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in ſecret manner, and without the privitie of any, ſlipped away) Marqueſſe <hi>Caſsianus</hi> ſtrucke with a deepe ſuſpition of the thing, and other great captains there in place of government and commaund, came roughly upon <hi>Craugaſius,</hi> and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to put him to death, crying with open mouth, That the man neither came nor went without his will. But he fearing to be charged as a traytor, and troubled exceeding much in mind, for feare leaſt by the revolt of ſome fugitives thither, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence might be given, That his wife remained living, and was moſt kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated; by way of ſemblance affected marriage with another brave and noble vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: and ſo pretending that hee would provide things neceſſarie for his nuptiall feaſt, went forth to a village ſtanding eight myles from the towne, and ſo with all the ſpeed and haſt he could make, fled to a companie of Perſian forrayers that were abroad to waſt the countrey, of whom he had intelligence that they approched: and being gladly of them received, and known by the words he ſpake who he was, after five dayes delivered he was to <hi>Sapor,</hi> and by him to the king. So after he had recovered his goods, which had beene taken from him, and all his deareſt friends, together with his wife, whom for ſome few moneths he had loſt, hee was in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place next unto <hi>Antoninus;</hi> howbeit, as the excellent Poet ſayth, <hi>Longo proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus intervallo, i.</hi> next indeed, but yet a great way off. For he having a notable wit, and grounded beſides by long experience of the world, was a very ſufficient man, and able by ſome policie to compaſſe whatſoever he tooke in hand: whereas <hi>Crau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſius</hi> was by nature very ſimple, yet in name as well renowmed and much ſpoken of. And theſe things verily happened not long after. But the king, albeit in his countenance he made ſhew of ſecuritie, and ſeemed in outward apparance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce for the deſtruction of this citie, yet greatly diſquieted and grieved deepely at the heart he was, when he caſt up his accompts, and found, how hee had many times ſuſtained lamentable loſſes in theſe dangerous and miſchievous ſieges, yea, and that himſelfe had loſt farre more of his owne people than he had taken of our men alive, or ſlaine at leaſtwiſe in ſo many skirmiſhes. Like as it fell out divers times at Niſibis and Singara: and ſemblably having for ſeventie three dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguered Amida with a multitude of armed ſouldiors, hee loſt thirtie thouſand fighting men and good warriors: which within a while after were by <hi>Diſcenes</hi> a Tribune and Notarie reckoned the eaſier, by this difference obſerved: for that the

Whiles <hi>Constantius</hi> among theſe occurrents was thus doubtfull what to doe, as who ſtill in his Winter repoſe at Sirmium ſat carking and muſing upon the matter, throughly moved and troubled he was with fearefull and heavie newes, ſhewing that which he then was much afraid of, namely, how the Limigantes of Sarmatia, who (as I have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) had expelled their owne lords and maſters out of their ancient ſeats and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, having by little and little neglected thoſe places, which the yeare paſt in a good and profitable policie were ſet out and appointed for them, leaſt (as they

Which outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of theirs, the Emperour ſuppoſing that they would ſhortly grow to prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tearmes, if the buſineſſe were deferred, having gathered together from all parts a number of moſt expert and active ſouldiors, tooke the field in the beginning of the Spring, before it was yet come to the height; the more forward to this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in two reſpects, for that the armie full of rich booties, ſince the end of the late Summer was confidently upon the like hope emboldened to the atchievement of proſperous exploits: and againe, becauſe <hi>Anotolius</hi> at that time fitting as <note n="*" place="margin">ſc. <hi>Pratorio.</hi>
                  </note> Pręfect for Illyricum, there was abundance of all neceſſarie proviſion gotten together al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, even before the ordinarie time, without the loſſe and hinderance to any man.

And thenceforth the inhabitants of thoſe parts might have lived exempt from hurt, and beene ſaved harmeleſſe, conſidering all matters of quarrels and complaints were huſht: but that afterward the odious and deteſtable titles of matters exquiſitely ſought out and deviſed, and the ſame amplified and aggravated in criminous wiſe by thoſe that both exhibite and admit ſuch bills, whiles theſe of the one ſide ſtraine and ſtrive to have their power and authoritie ſettled and continued to them ſtill, and thoſe of the other hoped, if all men were ſhrigged of their goods, and left bare, they ſhould live in ſafetie, grew at length to open proſcriptions &amp; hanging of ſilly innocent perſons.

Yet ſome few yeomen of the guard, whiles they laboured to keepe the villains back, flaſhing as it were upon them like flames of fire, loſt their lives, as beeing cruſhed with the weight onely of thoſe that fell upon them; and the kings throne, together with the cuſhion all cloth of gold, was ſtollen and carried away, whiles there was no man to gaineſay it.

For theſe rebels were driven to extremities, whiles ſome were killed downright in the place, others for deadly feare ſcattered aſunder: of whom, a great ſort conceiving ſome hope of life by prayers which came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, after many a blow &amp; wound received one in the necke of another, were maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred in the end.

And for as much as ſome perſonally preſent, and ſome again by others ſending a ſcript, that ſhewed what they were deſirous to know, with an expreſſe forme of ſupplications conceived, asked counſell of the divine powers, thoſe pieces of paper or parchment which contained in them their requeſts and petitions, remained otherwhiles, even after anſweres given, in the chappell. Of theſe, ſome upon a malicious intent were ſent unto the Emperour, who, as he was a man of a baſe mind, carrying a deafe eare in other matters even of great weight and importance, became in this particular cauſe and information preſented unto him, paſſing tractable and ſuſpitious; and beſides, being prepared before hand na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally with bitter gall, ſoone was heat, and caught fire.

Semblably, <hi>Demetrius</hi> a Philoſopher, ſirnamed <hi>Cythras,</hi> a man verily farre ſtept in yeares, but having ſtill a good ſtrong bodie, and as ſtout a mind, being hardly layed unto and charged, That divers times he had offered ſacrifice, could not denie the fact, but the fault, impleading, That from the very prime of his youth he had uſed ſo to do, for to pleaſe and pacifie God, and never ſounded nor ſearched into high matters; for he did not ſo much as know any man that affected or deſired it. Continuing therefore a long time ſet faſt on the racke, when ſurely grounded upon a firme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, he perſiſted feareleſſe, and without varying in his anſweres alleadged and pleaded ſtill the ſame, ſuffered he was without any further harme received to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part unto Alexandria, where he was borne. And theſe verily, with ſome few others, the righteous hand of God, which helpeth and aſſiſteth Truth, delivered out of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame and preſent dangers. But whiles theſe criminations and endictments ſpred ſtill further and further by intricate and intangling ſnares without end, ſome, after their bodies were piteouſly mangled, died therof; others deſpoyled of their goods, were condemned to ſuffer further puniſhment: and <hi>Paulus</hi> all the whiles was the prompter and ſuccentor of theſe cruell enterludes, which out of a ſpence or budget of craftie devices he brought forth in open ſhew to do hurt, and whereof he acted many: upon whoſe will and pleaſure I may in manner boldly ſay, depended the life of as many as went on the ground. For if a man wore about his necke any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies againſt the Quartane ague, or ſome other paine, or could be charged by the information of evill-willers, to have paſſed by a monument in the evening, as one that were a witch or ſorcerer, and collected the horrors of ſepulchres, and vaine il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14644:74"/>
of ſpirits and ghoſts walking and wandering thereabout, pronounced hee was to deſerve death, and he died for it. And verily, the matter was thus for all the world carried and handled, as if many a man had ſollicited <hi rend="sup">u</hi> 
                  <hi>Clarus,</hi> the <hi rend="sup">x</hi> Dodonae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an trees, and the Oracles of <hi rend="sup">y</hi> Delphi, which were ſo famous in times paſt, and all to procure the death and deſtruction of the Emperour. Whereupon the Palatine cohort of courtiers about him curiouſly and finely faining naughtie deviſes of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, affirmed flatly, That he ſhould from henceforth be exempt from all evils that commonly befell other men, giving it out alowd with open mouth, That his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had appeared at all times powerfull and ſurely effectuall in confounding and deſtroying of his adverſaries. And verily, that there was ſuch ſtreight inquiſition into theſe matters, no man of wiſedome and diſcretion findeth fault. For we doe not denie, that the life and ſafetie of a lawfull prince, who is a protector and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of good men, and from whom we ſeeke for means of others ſafetie, ought with joint diligence and endevour of all men to be fenced and maintained: For whoſe redeeming with might and maine, when upon violence and abuſe offered to his majeſtie he ſtandeth upon his guard and defence, the laws <hi rend="sup">z</hi> Cornelię have exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no perſon of what eſtate and degree ſoever from examination by way of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though the ſame were with loſſe of bloud. But on the other ſide, it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not princes unmeaſurably to rejoyce and take pleaſure in the wofull caſes of ſubjects, leaſt they ſhould ſeeme governed by licentiouſneſſe and not by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And the example of <hi>Tully</hi> ought in this point to be followed, who when it was in his power to harme and to ſpare (as himſelfe affirmeth) ſought for cauſes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe, and not occaſions of puniſhment: which is the proper dutie of a diſcreet and conſiderate Iudge. At the ſame time, in Daphne, that pleaſant and ſumptuous place, neere unto the citie Antioch, was borne a monſter, horrible to be ſeene and reported, an infant with two mouths, two teeth, a beard, foure eyes, and two excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding little eares: which birth ſo miſhapen and deformed, foretold; that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth was turning into a foule and ill favoured ſtate. Now ſuch ſtrange and uncouth monſters as theſe are many times brought forth into the world, ſignifying and praeſaging the events of ſundrie things; which becauſe they are not openly, as in old time, expiated, they paſſe away as unheard of and unknowne. And even in theſe dayes, the Iſauri, who had beene long time quiet, after they had done ſome acts, according to the contents of the former ſtorie, and attempted the ſiege of the citie Seleucia, reviving by little and little (as ſerpents are wont in the Spring ſeaſon to leape out of their holes) came downe the craggie ſtraits and deſart wields, and then putting themſelves cloſe into thicke companies and ſquadrons, as robbers and brigands, ſore troubled and diſquieted the borderers, and withall, as mountainers, paſſed beſide the fore-fences and ſtations of our ſouldiors unſeene, and by meanes of their dayly practiſe ran eaſily to and fro over rockes and through grounds full of buſhes. For the appeaſing of whom, either by maine force or reaſonable perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Lauritius</hi> was ſent as ruler, with the dignitie alſo of a Comes added to his ſtyle, a man politicke, and of a civile carriage, who reformed moſt enormities by threatening rather than by rigorous dealing: inſomuch, as for a great time, while he governed the province, there happened nothing that was reputed worthie of puniſhment.</p>

And to increaſe this fearefull accident, it fell out ſo, that when the heavenly daylight was <note n="*" place="margin">operiretur.</note> hidden by reaſon that there was a totall darkneſſe over the face of the earth like unto the night, men were afraid, and ſuppoſed verily, that the Sunne was extraordinarily <note n="*" place="margin">Like as the moone in her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Sunne, which we call the Chaunge, hath an univerſall defect.</note> eclipſed, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him firſt diminiſhed to the ſhape of the Moone, horned, or in the new; then, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to the forme of an halfe Moone, and afterward reſtored full and whole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. A thing that happeneth not at other times ſo evidently, unleſſe it be when the Moone, after unequall and oblique courſes, and certaine ſpaces betweene, in her change returneth to the ſame points or beginning; that is, when in the houſe of the ſame ſigne the whole body of the Moone is found by moſt direct lines quite oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite under the Sunne, and ſtayeth a while in theſe minutes, which in the art of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie are tearmed Parts. But, albeit the converſions and motions of both planets, as the ſearchers <note n="*" place="margin">Aſtronomers.</note> of intelligible cauſes have obſerved, after the courſe of the moone

fulfilled, by a perpetuall diſtinction meet in one and the ſame end: yet is not the Sunne in thoſe daies alwayes hidden and covered, but when the Moone by a juſt plumbe-line, as it were, is oppoſite in the middeſt, and interpoſed betweene the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie globe of the Sunne and our ſight. In briefe, then is the Sunne hidden, and his ſhining light ſuppreſſed, when himſelfe and the roundle of the Moone (the loweſt of all the ſtarres) accompanying together, keeping their owne proper Sphęres, and placed joyntly (ſaving the regard of height) as <hi>Ptolomaee</hi> both skilfully and elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth, are come to thoſe dimenſions which they uſually tearme in the Greeke tongue <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is to ſay, eclipticke or defective conjunctions aſcending and deſcending. And if they touch the places joyning cloſe unto the ſaid <note n="*" place="margin">Caput &amp; cauda Draconis.</note> joynts, the eclipſe will be the ſmaller: but if they abide in the very points and joynts, which bind more ſtreight together the ſaid aſcents and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, then is the skie overcaſt with groſſer darkeneſſe, as if the aire were thickened; ſo that we are not able to ſee ſo much as the things that ſtand juſt before our eyes. Moreover, wee thinke that wee behold two Sunnes in this wiſe: in caſe a cloud mounted higher than ordinarie, and ſhining againe by reaſon of the neereneſſe of thoſe eternall <note n="*" place="margin">from the Sunne.</note> lights, repreſent the brightneſſe of another circle by the reflection, as it were, from a pure glaſſe. Now, come we to the Moone. Thus onely and not otherwiſe ſuffereth the Moone a plaine and evident eclipſe, when beeing in her full light round, and oppoſit unto the Sunne, ſhe is from his Orbe diſtant one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eightie parts, that is to ſay, in the ſeventh ſigne. And albeit this diſtance and oppoſition happeneth alway in every full Moone, yet for all that ſhee is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes then eclipſed. But becauſe ſhe being placed about the mobilitie of the earth and the utmoſt of that univerſall beautie, and moſt remote from heaven, putteth her ſelfe under the Sunne, that otherwhiles ſtriketh upon her, by interpoſition of the limit of the night that endeth in a pointed cone, ſhe lieth hidden for a while, and is enwrapped or covered within the blacke globes of ſhadow, in caſe the Sunne, compaſſed about with the bent of the inward Sphęre, by reaſon of the maſſe of earth lying in the way, is not able to enlighten her with his beames, for that ſhe hath no proper light of her owne, according as divers opinions have collected. Againe, when by equall parts ſhe meeteth with the Sunne at one and the ſame ſigne, darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſhe is (as hath beene ſaid) totally, and her white and bright hue is wholly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, what time ſhe is called in Greeke <gap reason="foreign">

Now, ſhe is thought to ariſe new againe, when by a ſmall declining, as it were, from a plumbe-line, ſhe carrieth the Sunne erected juſt over her. And this ariſing of hers as yet but ſmall, is firſt ſeene of men, when leaving the companie of the Sunne, ſhe proceedeth to the ſecond ſigne. After ſhe is gone therefore further ſtill, and is now good and lightſome, and ſhaped, as one would ſay, with hornes, ſhe commeth to be tearmed <gap reason="foreign">

And when in the end by mild ſpeeches he had appeaſed their tumult, thus much moreover he added and ſayd: <hi>Let your angrie mood, I pray you, ceaſe for a while: without diſſention or ſeditious ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of alteration, that which yee demaund ſhall eaſily be obtained. For as much as yee are poſſeſsed thus with the ſweetneſſe of your native countrey, and feare to go into ſtrange lands which yee are not acquainted with, returne yee now even out of hand unto your owne home: ſee you ſhall nothing beyond the Alpes, becauſe it is diſpleaſant unto you: and hereof I will aſſoyle you by a competent ſatisfaction before the Emperour, a prince capable of reaſon and moſt prudent withall.</hi> After theſe words they ſet up a lowd crie on all ſides, God ſave <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> natheleſſe, when with one uniforme zeale and heat of affection they all preaſſed on him ſtill, and that with an exceeding earneſt noyſe, mixed with reprochfull and reviling tearmes, <hi>Caeſar</hi> was enforced to condiſcend unto them.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt the day following, when a truce by common aſſent after manyfold travaile and paines taken was graunted, what time as a great terror was preſented round about the walls, and the Perſians feared no leſſe, a Chriſtian biſhop ſhewed by certaine ſignes of geſture and by becke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that he was willing to goe foorth, and upon faithfull promiſe of returne in ſafe conduct, he came as farre as to the kings pavilions: where after leave given to ſpeake his mind, in a mild manner of ſpeech he perſuaded with the Perſians to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part home, now that both parts had received in common lamentable loſſes, ſaying withall, that greater ſorrowes yet were to bee feared which happily would come unto them. But hee ſtood diſcourſing of theſe and ſuch like points in vaine: ſuch was the fell and outrageous furie of the king, who withſtood the motion, &amp; ſtoutly ſwore, That he would not depart before the towne and fortifications about it were deſtroyed: yet was the biſhop ſomewhat ſuſpected (untruly, as I thinke, though commonly it was by many men vouched) That in ſecret conference and talke hee informed <hi>Sapor</hi> what parts of the wall he ſhould aſſault, as weake within-forth and eaſie to be battered. And this ſeemed to carrie ſome likelyhood with it, for that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the enemies engines were evidently ſeene with a great ſhout and joyous leaping of the aſſaylants to play luſtily upon the undefenſible places, and ſuch as for very age and rottenneſſe began to leane and were readie to fall, as if ſome that knew the inward ſecrets of the citie, had given direction. And albeit the narrow wayes yeelded difficult acceſſe unto the walls, and the Rams fitted for batterie were hardly ſet forward, for feare of ſtones throwne by hand, and arrow-ſhot that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14644:80"/>
kept them off, yet ceaſed not eyther the brakes or ſcorpions, wherof theſe diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſtones thicke, the other ſent out darts as faſt, and together with them baskets and panniers burning, beſmeared over with pitch and <hi rend="sup">k</hi> Bitumen: by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall fall whereof, comming ſtill downe the hill, the ſayd engines of artillerie ſtucke faſt, as fixed and rooted deepe within ground; and beeing thus ſet, fierie darts and burning linkes together throwne luſtily with a good arme and ſtar hand, ſet them on a light fire. But although the caſe ſtood thus, and many on both ſides were ſlaine, yet the aſſaylants were more hotely ſet to raſe and deſtroy the towne, (both by naturall ſituation ſtrong, and alſo by great workemanſhip of mans hand fortified) ere the middeſt of Winter; as being perſuaded, that the kings rage would not be allayed before. And therefore, neither the effuſion of much bloud, nor the number of them that were ſhot into the bodie and deadly wounded, could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme the reſt from like boldneſſe. But when they had a long time maintained fight with much hurt and miſchiefe gotten thereby, at length they expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to extreame and preſent dangers: and as they drave their Rammes, what with the weightie ſtones comming thicke from the wals, and what with ſundrie fireworkes, debarred they were from going forward. Howbeit, one Ram higher than his fellowes, covered over with wet bulls hides, and therefore in leſſe danger of miſhap by flames or darts, going before all, with much ſtraining and endevour crept to the wall, and ſo with his mightie ſharpe pointed head entring betweene the joints of the ſtones, and having loſened the ſame, overthrew a tower: which bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen with a wonderfull craſhing noyſe, they alſo who ſtood upon it, with ſo ſuddain a ruine thereof were throwne downe, and ſo eyther breaking their bones, or overwhelmed with rubbiſh, died ſundry deaths, and thoſe unlooked for: thus the armed multitude having found a more ſafe aſcent, ruſhed in. Then, as the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous noyſe which the Perſians made, yelling and crying out on every ſide, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and reſounded in the fearefull eares of the towneſmen thus over-matched, the fight grew hote and more cloſe within the wals, whiles our enemies in ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons fought at hand, conſidering that ſtanding with their bodies one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thicke, and having their ſwords drawne on both ſides, there was not one ſpared that ſtood in the way. In concluſion, the beſieged reſiſting a long time with much adoe, and to the miſchiefe of both ſides, were at length with the preſſing hard of the huge multitude diſranked and ſcattered by heapes: after which, the angry ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies put to ſword whomſoever they could find, the ſmall babes were plucked from their mothers boſomes, the mothers alſo themſelves killed, and no man regarded what he did. And yet in the meane time this bloudie nation more greedie of pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage than of carnage, loaden with all kind of rich ſpoyles, and leading away an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great number of priſoners, went backe with much rejoycing to their tents. The king for all he was puffed up with extraordinarie joy, as one who a long time burned in deſire to win Phaenicha, a ſtrong fenced piece, and of great importance, departed not thence, before that hee had right ſtrongly repayred that part of the wall which was ſhattered, layed up there in ſtore plentie of victuals, and beſtowed in it a garriſon of armed men, ſuch as for their birth were of good note, and for skill in martiall feats renowmed. For he feared (as it fell out indeed) leaſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes taking to the heart the loſſe of ſuch mightie ſtrong holds, would addreſſe themſelves by maine force to beſiege the ſame.

But if I may with your good leave ſay ſo much, in caſe there be any chaunge and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now (as you thinke there is) hence it commeth: The ſouldiors ſpending their yeares in many warres, and thoſe right dangerous, without reaping any fruit of their ſervice, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that in tumultuous manner at length, which long ſince they determined, as impatient to ſerve under a Commaunder in a ſecond place; ſeeing that by a <hi>Caeſar</hi> they could have no recompence made for their long labour, and many victories. To whoſe anger, for that they neither found augmentation of dignities, nor touched their yearely wages, this alſo is fallen out unlooked for to aggravate the matter, That beeing men acquainted with cold and frozen countries, they were commaunded to come to the utmoſt parts of the East world, and drawne away needie and bare, apart from their wives and children. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they being enraged above their wonted manner, in the night aſsembled themſelves together, and beſet the palace with loud voices, and thoſe often reiterated, ſtyling <hi>Iulian</hi> by the name of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> This ſet me in a trembling, I confeſſe, and I withdrew my ſelfe: and thus ſo long as I could keepe me out of the way, I ſought to ſave my ſelfe with holding my peace and hiding my head. But when they would give me no time nor reſpite to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon the matter, fenced (as I may ſo ſay) with the wall of a free and pure heart, I went forth and ſtood in the ſight of them all, ſuppoſing this their tumultuous riſing might ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by authoritie of countenance or gentle words be allayed. Howbeit, they grew into a wonderfull heat, and went ſo farre, as that becauſe I aſsayed to overcome their ſtubborne obſtinacie by entreatie, they inſtantly menaced death, as it ſeemed by their violent aſſaults following one in the necke of another.

his owne behoofe and ſafetie. And for as much as among theſe proceedings hee feared <hi>Lupicinus,</hi> though abſent, and then making his abode in Britannie, a prowd minded man, and of a ſwelling nature: and for that hee had him in ſuſpition and jealouſie, that if he knew thus much beyond the ſeas, he would ſtirre up ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of alteration and rebellion: a <note n="*" place="margin">or Chauncellor.</note> Notarie of his was ſent to <note n="*" place="margin">Bologne.</note> Bononia, for to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and watch carefully, that no man might be ſuffered to paſſe over the narrow ſeas: By meanes of which prohibition, <hi>Lupicinus</hi> returned, before that he tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knowledge of theſe newes, and ſo was not able to raiſe any troubles. Howbeit <hi>Iulian</hi> a right joyous man now, in regard of his higher fortune and the confidence he had in his ſouldiors, becauſe he would not wax luke warme, nor be reproved as one remiſſe, idle and doing nothing, after hee had diſpatched embaſſadours unto <hi>Constantius,</hi> went foorth into the marches of <note n="*" place="margin">Low Dutchland, or Netherlands.</note> Germania ſecunda: and having ſtrengthened himſelfe with all furniture and proviſion, which the buſineſſe in hand required, drew neere to the towne Obtricenſis, neere Moſa.

But when they upon a naturall obſtinacie and inbred reſolution rejected this offer, as men being nobly deſcended &amp; of high parentage, they addreſſed themſelves with undergoing of extreame perils and paines againſt all the preparations that belong unto a ſiege: He therefore began to give an aſſault unto all parts of the towne, with his men marſhalled in thicke rankes, and with ſound of trumpets to incite their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to the ſervice: the valiant Romane ſouldior, for that the legions were gathered under ſundrie defenſive roufes of ſhields, going ſoftly and ſafely forward, began to undermine the wals: and becauſe all manner of caſting-weapons were diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon them that came under the ſaid wals, and thereby the ſaid joynt frame of their ſhields looſened, they departed upon the ſound of the retreat.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He tenth day therefore, after the aſſault began, when our mens hope grew worſe than it was, ſo that they were ſet all in heavineſſe, thought good it was to bring over that huge frame of a Ram, which the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in times paſt, after they had by the batterie thereof raſed Antiochia brought from thence, and left at Carras: which being on a ſodain ſeene, and moſt artificially ſet together and fitted accordingly, daunted the hearts of the beſieged ſo, as that they had fallen in manner to the laſt remedie of yeelding, but that they tooke heart againe, and prepared to oppoſe ſome meanes againſt this terrible and menacing engin. Neither after this gave our men over one jot to adventure raſhly, or to adviſe politikely: For whiles this old Ram, beeing unjoynted and taken in peeces, for eaſier carriage, was a ſetting in order and readineſſe, with all cunning and ſtrength of man, notwithſtanding the exceeding force and firme reſolution of the defendants, the peeces of ordnance were ſtill defended: nevertheleſſe with a number of ſtones and bullets ſent out of ſlings on both ſides, many were killed, and ſtill the mounts and bulwarkes waxed greater, and quickly roſe to a mightie height: ſo that the ſiege grew more fierce and hoter every day than other; and many of our men loſt their lives in the place: for that, fighting in the ſight of the Emperour in hope of rewards, and taking off their helmets from their heads, becauſe they might the ſooner be knowne, they were with the cunning ſhot of the enemies archers overthrowne: and therefore tending watch and ward both night and day they ſtood more wary on both parts, and did their devoir. And now by this time the Perſians, ſeeing the banks &amp; terraces brought up to a mightie height, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the huge ram aforeſaid, after which there followed alſo other ſmaller engins of that kind, were ſtricken with a wonderful horror, and did what they poſſibly could with might and maine to burne them all: and albeit they ceaſed not to fling heaps and bals of wild-fire, and ſhoot fiery darts, yet they laboured in vaine; for that moſt of the timber peeces were covered all over with skins and hayre clothes throughly wet; others againe well ſmeared with alum, that the fire might glide off without doing harme. But the Romans bringing them forward with great force and valor, though with much difficutlie, yet defended and ſaved them: and in an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they had to win the towne, they ſet nought by imminent and preſent dangers: and on the other ſide the defendants of the wals, when the greateſt Ram above ſaid came toward them, ready to ſhake downe the tower that ſtood againſt it, by a ſubtle deuiſe enſnared the yron front that it beareth out before (and in truth it reſembleth a Rammes head) with long ropes on either ſide, and ſo held it faſt, that by retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning backe againe it ſhould not gather new ſtrength, nor be able with thicke jurres and puſhes, forcibly to ſtrike the walls to any purpoſe: and withall they powred downe ſcalding hot pitch. The engins alſo being advanced forward, ſtood along time carrying upon them huge ſtones, to batter the walls, and other caſting wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons. Now, when the mounts without were rayſed ſtill higher, the defendants fearing their deſtruction was at hand, unleſſe they tooke the better heed, ran head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into a moſt bold and adventurous action: and in a ſodaine ſally, iſſuing by
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14644:84"/>
numbers out at the gates, and ſetting upon the formoſt of our men, threw with all their might upon the Ram, fire-brands and yron buckets loden with fire. But after a skirmiſh valiantly performed with doubtfull fortune, moſt of them prevailing nought, were driven backe within the wals: and anon from the mounts which the Romans had erected, the ſame Perſians as they ſtood upon their bulwarkes were aſſayled with arrowes, ſlings-ſhot, and fiery darts; which flying among the roofes and curtaines of the towers, for the moſt part went by, or glaunced in vaine, and did no hurt, for that there were ſome of purpoſe readie to quench them. And when on both ſides the fighting men grew to be fewer, and the Perſians were driven to utmoſt diſpaire, but that they found better meanes, they eftſoons gave the attempt with greater care and diligence to ſally out of their fortifications: and ſo the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude breaking ſuddenly forth, among our armed ſouldiers, ſome appointed there were of purpoſe, who carried greater ſtore of fire than thoſe before, and threw yron skuttles full of flaming fire upon the timber frames, ſtickes alſo and twigges, with other dry fewell, very apt to take fire. And for that the exceeding blacke clouds of ſmoake tooke away all ſight, when the trumpet ſounded the battaile, the legions in good array marched on a quicke pace; and as the heat of skirmiſh grew ſtill by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, by that time they came to buckle at hand-ſtrokes, all the foreſaid engines at once were on a light fire, and in manner burnt, ſave only that greater one than the reſt, which, being halfe burnt, after the ropes were plucked away, that were caſt upon it from the wals and held it faſt, with much adoe, and by the forcible ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſtrong men, was drawne forth of the fire. But when the darkeneſſe of the night made an end of the skirmiſh, our ſouldiers reſted not long, but beeing refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſmall food and ſhort ſleepe, they roſe at the call of their captaines, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved their munitions far from the wall, providing to fight more cloſe and ſhort along the high baſtiles or countermures, which now that they were finiſhed over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topped the walls: and that the defendants might eaſily be driven from off the wals, upon the very top of the ſaid baſtiles were planted two Baliſts, for feare of which it was verily thought, that not one of the enemies could ſo much as put up his head and looke out before him. Theſe meanes being ſufficiently provided, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the twy-light of the morning appeared, three battailons of our men in good array advancing, with the creſts of their helmets bending forward in threatning wiſe, together with a number that carried ladders, attempted to giue an aſſault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wals: And now as the armor clattered, and the trumpets reſounded, fighting on both ſides joyntly with ſemblable heat and eagreneſſe, they made a venturous conflict of it: which as it did ſpread ſtill more and more, the Romans, perceiuing that the Perſians hid their heads for feare of the engines of artillery placed upon the mounts, did beat upon the walls with the ram, and then with mattocks, pickaxes, yron crowes, and ladders, they approched: meane while on both ſides flew the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting dartes thicke. But that which troubled and annoyed the Perſians much more than all the reſt, was the ſundrie ſhot diſcharged from the Baliſts, running as it were through loope holes and grates from the baſtiles newly rayſed: Whereupon, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing now that they were come to the laſt caſt, they ran reſolutely upon the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death: and thus having parted betweene them the ſeverall charges to fight upon the point of any extremitie that ſhould happen, and leaving thoſe behind that ſhould keepe the walls, a ſtrong companie of them ſecretly ſetting open a poſterne gate, iſſued forth, with others following behind, that cloſely carried fire with them.

Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to increaſe their feare, there were apparitions ſeen continually of the rain-bow: which how it commeth uſually to be ſhaped ſo, the laying open of the natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thereof will declare.

And this temperature of mingled beautie, it carryeth, as our underſtandings here upon the earth do conceive, therfore, becauſe the firſt part thereof is ſeene more thin and wateriſh, as ſutable in colour to the aire round about it: the next following is tawnie, that is, of a deeper &amp; brighter hue ſomewhat than the former yellow: the third red, for that being ſubject to the brightneſſe of the ſun, by the receit of the ſpirit or aire, it diſcoloureth and diminiſheth his moſt pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendence glittering over againſt: the fourth therefore a purple colour, becauſe as the thicke ſprinkling dews through which it riſeth glitter betweene, it caſteth forth ſhining rayes and ſheweth to our ſight a colour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming neere unto that of a flame:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14644:85"/>
which colour, as it ſpreadeth more abroad, turneth into blew and greene. Others are of opinion, That the forme of a raine-bow then appeareth to things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath in the world, when the beames of the ſunne infuſed deepely into a thicke cloud carried up on high, have caſt a cleere light into it: the which not finding iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, winding round into it ſelfe, with much fretting and ſtriking therupon, ſhineth, and thoſe colours verily which come neereſt unto white, it taketh from the Sunne that is aloft; but ſuch as are greeniſh, from the reſemblance of the cloud next over it; as uſually it falleth out in the ſea, where the waves be white that beat upon the ſhore and ſea banks, but thoſe farther within the ſea, be without any mixture blew or azure. And becauſe it is a ſigne of change of weather (as wee have ſaid) namely after a cleere aire gathering heapes of clouds, or contrariwiſe, after thicke aire making a change to faire and pleaſant weather, therefore we read often in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, that <hi>Iris, i.</hi> the Rain-bow, is ſent from heaven, when there is an alteration toward of the preſent ſtate. There be many others, and thoſe ſundrie opinions, which now it were a ſuperfluous thing to reckon up, conſidering that my narration haſteneth to returne whence it hath digreſſed. With theſe and ſuch like objects the Emperor was toſſed betweene hope and feare, whiles the Winter came on a pace, and grew to be hard, whiles he ſuſpected alſo to be forelaid in thoſe deſerts and wild tracts; and withall, he feared likewiſe ſome mutinie of the ſouldiers that were diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and angrie.

For which cauſes, giving over his vaine enterpriſe, he returneth into Syria, minding to Winter in Antioch, after he had endured a labourious and moſt dangerous Summer, and the ſame a long time to be lamented.

For, the goodneſſe of the heavenly power (either becauſe men deſerve ſo much, or for that the ſame is moved with ſome affection unto them) uſeth even by theſe arts alſo to diſcover unto us thoſe occurrents that hang over our heads.

As for dreames, ſeldome are they to be beleeved; but infallible they would be, in caſe they who reaſon and debate of them miſſed not in their coniecture: And otherwhiles (as</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle <hi>affirmeth) ſetled they are and ſtable, when the ſight of the eye as a living creature, ſoundly ſleeping, and bending neither way aſide, ſeeth moſt directly before it.

To diſpatch therefore what I have purpoſed, letting all circumstance goe by, marke I pray you favourably what I ſhall in few words deliver. Being by the will of God in heaven entermingled in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie with you in the very beginning of my youth, the continuall inrodes and invaſions as well of Alemans as of Frankes, I repreſſed, and iointly with vigorous courage, I made Rhene paſſable to the Romane forces as often as they would; ſtanding unmoveable againſt the noyſe of rumors and the violent excurſions of puiſsant nations, truſting I aſſure you and grounding my ſelfe upon your vertue and valour. And theſe painefull labours which we have taken and ſuſtained, Gaule an eye-witneſse thereof (which after the loſſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a mans life after long and grievous calamities hath beene relieved) ſhall commend unto posteritie from age to age for ever.

That we may therefore iointly with one accord and mind prevent adverſe events, follow this way and policie that is right good (as I take it) ſeeing the welfare of the State is correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to our intention and deſire: and whiles the countries of Illyricum are without grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter garriſons, let us march on apace without stay, and take the time to ſeize into our hands the utmost bounds of Dacia, and from thence by the meanes of good ſucceſſe be furniſhed with instructions what ought further to be done: and as the manner is of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and redoubted leaders and captaines, promiſe, I beſeech you, by the bond of an oath, continuance of concord, and fidelitie unto me your Commaunder, who will endevour</hi>

And now by this time, bearing himſelfe more aloft, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king verily that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> could never poſſibly be wrought unto an agreement, he ſent unto the Senat a ſharp and invective oration laying open certaine reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full villanies and vices againſt him: Which when they were read in the Senat houſe by <hi>Tertullius,</hi> who as yet governed the citie of Rome as Praefect, right nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was the curteſie and thankfull goodneſſe of the nobilitie unto him, joyned with an honourable teſtimonie of their affiance in him: for with one accord of ſentence and judgement, they cryed out all alowd, <hi>Autorituo reverentiam rogamus,</hi> i. <hi>We wiſh and award reverence and honour to thy Author.</hi> Then alſo it was, that he harrowed the memoriall of <note n="*" place="margin">the Great.</note>

And having ſhut up all wayes of entrance, and manned the towers and bulwarks thereof with armed ſouldiers, they made preparation againſt the time to come for fight, living in the meane time at eaſe and libertie: and by this ſo audacious an act, they ſtirred up the Italian inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, to ſide with <hi>Constantius,</hi> as if he had beene yet living.

And becauſe there was now nothing looked for but fight, after they had on both ſides refreſhed their bodies with food and ſleepe, earely in the morning with ſound of trumpets incenſed they were to doe miſchiefe one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another; and ſo with more haſt than good adviſement, they ſet up cries amaine, and prepared to encounter. The aſſaylants therefore carrying before them roofe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences and hurdles very thicke wrought, marched ſoftly and with good heed; and ſo with a number of yron tooles aſſayed to dig under the walls, and many of them brought skaling ladders, framed to the juſt meaſure and heights of the ſaid walls.

But this ſecond enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe as wiſely as it was begun, ſped amiſſe in the end. For when theſe towers drew neere, aſſayled they were with ſhot of fierie darts all beſmeared over with pitch, with reed alſo, with ſtickes, twigs, and ſundrie ſorts of fuell, readie to catch a light fire. Which towers being quickly ſet a burning, when they bending forward, and reeling with the weight of thoſe that ſtood waving upon them, fell downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the river, ſome of the armed men, ſticked with engine-ſhot a farre off, were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from their very tops. During which conflict, the footmen beneath, after their ſhip-mates that ſerved on the water aloft were fallen, with huge ſtones were cruſht, all but ſome few, who by ſwift footmanſhip, through comberſome places of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, eſcaped.

For as the aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants upon ſorrow and lamentation for the death of their fellowes; ſo the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants in hope of winning the upper hand, were mightily incenſed, and yet theſe alſo themſelves tooke the loſſe of ſome few of their owne ſide right heavily.

And ſome of them bearing up their ſhields over head, to fight more nimbly; others carrying ladders, as before, upon their ſhoulders, and running forward with fervent violence, expoſed their breaſts to the ſtroke of many a dart. There were alſo, who ſetting in hand to breake the yron port-cluſes, were ſoone fired away, or killed with mightie ſtones from the wals. And ſome that went about very boldly to paſſe over the ditches, by the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine aſſaults of them that iſſued forth ſecretly at the poſterne gates, as they ruſhed on unadviſedly, were ſore hurt and ſet backe.

And albeit the defendants, in skill of martiall feats ſurpaſſed, who now had no other helpe left but their walls: yet our ſouldiors picked forth of the beſt companies, not able to endure long delayes, went round about all the places neere unto the citie, ſeeking by what forcible meanes or engines they might make way and breake into it.

For if he had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over that river, and found none to make head againſt him, without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie at all, he might have gone over Euphrates alſo: and otherwiſe again, keeping his ſouldiors for civile warre, he feared to expoſe them unto dangers about citie walls; having had experience particularly, of what ſtrength the wals of that Fort, and how reſolute alſo and valourous the defendors were. Nevertheleſſe, becauſe he would not ſit ſtill, nor be deſpiſed for his ſtouth, he enforced <hi>Arbetio</hi> and <hi>Agilo,</hi> with other captaines and officers of the Cavallerie, to make haſt with puiſſant regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under their conduct; not meaning that they ſhould provoke the Perſians to

fight, but keepe the hither bankes of Tigris with good guards and fore-fences, and to lye in eſpiall, whither their king in his violence would breake forth. This directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moreover he gave, by admonition and writing oft, That ſo ſoone as the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of enemies began to paſſe over, they ſhould draw backe with ſpeed. And whiles theſe captaines keepe the limits accordingly as they had in charge, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſecret deſigne of that moſt deceitfull nation, himſelfe remaining with the <hi rend="sup">1</hi> ſtronger <note n="*" place="margin">The old Legio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſouldiors and Infanterie.</note> part of the armie, had a carefull eye to all urgent occaſions, as if he meant to defend the townes that he had in his protection, by ſallies and outrodes. But the ſpies and fugitives from the adverſe part, as they otherwhiles came, delivered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences repugnant one to the other: as being uncertaine of future iſſues, by reaſon that among the Perſians there be none privie to their counſels but the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and great lords, who are ſilent and truſtie: among whom likewiſe there is a god alſo worſhipped, under the name of Silence. Now, the foreſaid captaines ſent dayly for the Emperour himſelfe to come unto them: for they proteſted, that they were not able to withſtand the violence of that moſt fierce king, without all their forces put together. Meane while that theſe matters are thus carefully handled, there arrived ſure meſſengers one after another, by whoſe faithfull relation it was knowne for a truth, That <hi>Iulian</hi> having with great celeritie paſſed beyond Italie and Illyricum, ſeized as he went the ſtraits or paſſe of Succi, and waited for aids to come with ſpeed from all parts; that beeing thus environed with a multitude of armed men, he might over-run Thraciae. Which being knowne, <hi>Constantius</hi> dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into a great agonie, with this one comfort yet ſuſtained himſelfe, That in <note n="*" place="margin">Civile warres.</note> home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troubles he had alwaies the upper hand: but conſidering how difficult a matter it was to take counſell what to doe in this caſe, he made choice of this courſe eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, namely, to beſtow his ſouldiors in <note n="*" place="margin">That lay as poſt for the affaires of State.</note> publicke waggons, and ſent them before by little and little, with the more expedition to meet with and reſiſt the imminent danger. And this opinion of his being by a generall conſent of all the armie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, they went, as they had commaundement, lightly appointed. And as he was taking this order, the next morning word was brought, that the king with his power which he had led forth, was returned home, by occaſion that the praeſaging ſignes by birds brake off his enterpriſe.

But now another accident is happened, more ſorrowfull I dare well ſay than all that went before, which by our native and in-bred fortitude with the helpe of God in heaven we ſhall repreſſe.</hi> Iulian, <hi>whom we ordained for the defence of Gaule, whiles yee were employed in aſſayling forraine nations that made a foule ſtirre round about Illyricum, preſuming upon victorie in ſome light skirmiſhes which he had with the Germanes, halfe naked men, hath borne his head aloft like a mad man, and aſſuming into his prowd ſocietie ſome few aid ſouldiors, readie in their fell ſtomacke and deſperate boldneſſe to enter into any miſchievous action, conſpired the hurt of the Commonweale, having abandoned and troden underfoot Iustice, the mother and nourſe of the Romane world, who as a goddeſſe to be revenged of ſuch as ioy in wicked deeds, will in the end bring ſuch prowd, ſwelling, and fierie ſpirits to dead ſparkes and embers, as my ſelfe have found by experience, and as I eaſily am induced to beleeve, by the knowledge I have out of auncient histories. What remaineth then, but that we withſtand theſe tempeſtuous whirlewinds that are raiſed, and by ſpeedie remedies repreſſe and quell the rage of this warre new ſprung up, before it bee growne to greater ſtrength. For there is no doubt to be made, with the favour of that moſt high God aſsiſting us, by whoſe eternall ſentence unthankefull perſons are alreadie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but that the edge of the ſword ſo impiouſly prepared, will be turned upon them to their utter deſtruction, who not provoked with iniuries, but made greater by many bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, have thus riſen up to endanger the innocent. For, as my mind preſageth, and iuſtice readie to further good counſels, doth promiſe, I dare undertake, that if they come once to buckle in cloſe fight, they will for ſtarke feare grow ſo benummed, that they ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to endure the ardent light, brandiſhing and ſparkling out of your eies, or the firſt noiſe of the outcrie at the ioyning of battaile.</hi> After theſe ſpeeches uttered, hee drew them all to his mind, and when they had anſwered the ſame with kind words and loving acclamations, they ſhooke their ſpeares in angrie wiſe, and called to bee led foorth out of hand into the field againſt the rebell.

As for the Palatine dignities, he gave them, as it were, by a certaine plumbe-line and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, and in his dayes no new upſtart, or unknowne perſon came in place to beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great ſway in the court, but he onely that after ten yeares ſpace was throughly knowne, like to <hi rend="sup">ſ</hi>

And verie ſeldome it fell out, that any martiall man paſſed to the adminiſtration of civile matters: and on the other ſide, none took the charge of ſouldiers, but ſuch as had beene hardened in warre ſervice. An earneſt mind and affection he had to learning: but when as by reaſon of his dull and heavie ſpirit he could not attaine unto Rhetoricke, he left it and went to Poetrie, wherein he did nothing to any purpoſe. In a frugall and ſober kind of life, by moderat ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking, he had his health ſo well, that ſeldome he contracted any diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but when he did, ſicke he was almoſt to death.

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14644:96"/>
in all ſuch caſes. And if an inckling were given of any ſuch thing, he addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſtreit inquiſition after it, more eagrely than might ſtand with civile juſtice, did ſet ſuch as were fell and dreadfull, to be the examiners and judges of theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and in puniſhing ſome, he went about to lengthen out the time of their death, if nature would permit, as one in ſuch points of judiciall trials, more cruel even than <hi>Gallienus.</hi> For he, being many times forelaid by the trains of traitors indeed, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Aureolus, Poſthumus, Ingenuus, Valens,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Theſſalonicus,</hi> and many others, puniſhed otherwhiles verie mildly their hainous faults, that would have coſt them their lives: but this man enforced their facts, even thoſe whereof ſome doubt was made, to ſeeme by violence of torment moſt evident and certaine.

Her aclitus</hi> alſo the Epheſian, affirmeth the ſame, and advertiſeth us, That brave and worthy men have divers times beene overcome (ſuch are the variable events that fortune worketh) even of idle and ſlothfull cowards. And that this moreover a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other principall prayſes is moſt eminent, when as authoritie placed in high degree, having the deſire to hurt, to be cruell and wroth, ſubdued, and, as it were, put under the yoke, hath erected a glorious trophie of clemencie, in the caſtle of a victorious mind. Now as this Prince in foreine warres went away with hurt and foyle, ſo by reaſon of civile conflicts, wherein he ſped well, he bare himſelfe proud, and by occaſion of the inward ulcers of Common weale, he was all embrued with horrible and filthy bloud: Whereupon, in a perverſe purpoſe rather than juſt and uſuall, he reared with great coſt and charges in Gaule and Pannonia triumphall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches even out of the loſſe and calamitie of the Provinces, together with the titles of his acts affixed thereto, for men to read, ſo long as thoſe monuments would be able to ſtand. Exceeding much addicted he was to his wives, to the ſmall puling voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Eunuches, and to ſome Courtyers, who applauded every word he ſpake, and obſerved to honour him, and ſooth him up in whatſoever hee affirmed or denyed. The diſtaſtfull bitterneſſe of theſe times, was made the worſe by the unſatiable extortion and ſnatching of theſe receivers, &amp; importunat collectors of tributes and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14644:97"/>
taxes, who drew more hatred upon his head, than money into his coffers. And this ſeemed unto many the more intollerable, for that he never heard any cauſe, nor tendered the indemnitie of the provinces, when they were over-layed with taxes, tributes, and impoſts, one in the necke of another. Over and above all this, apt hee was to take away againe what hee had once given; and that perfect and ſyncere religion of the Chriſtians hee blended with fooliſh and doting ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and beeing given to ſearch thereinto more intricately, than to ſettle it with gravitie, hee ſtirred many ſchiſmes and diſcords, which as they ſpread more and more, hee maintained with contentious words and diſputations: inſomuch as, whiles their biſhops courſed up and downe by troupes on poſt-horſes, allowed by the State, from Synode (as they tearme it) to Synode, labouring to bring all rites and ceremonies to their owne diſpoſe and will, he thereby cut the ſinewes quite of thoſe that kept waggons for hire.

And at the length <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prunculus Gallus</hi> the Oratour, a skilfull Soothſayer, and promoted afterwards to be governour of the province Narbonenſis, told him the events, inſtructed before hand (as himſelfe ſaid) by the inſpection of a liver, which hee had ſeene hidden within a duple skin. And when as <hi>Iulian</hi> feared for all that, leaſt this might bee deviſed to humour his deſire, and was therefore ſad and heavie, himſelfe eſpied a much more certaine praeſaging token, which evidently ſhewed the death of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius.</hi> For at the very ſame inſtant, when the ſaid <hi>Conſtantius</hi> died in Cilicia, it happened, that the <note n="*" place="margin">yeoman of the stirrup.</note> ſouldior, who with his right hand lifted him up to his horſe backe, caught a fall and lay along on the ground, whereupon he cried out by and by in the hearing of many, That He was fallen who had rayſed him up to his high place of dignitie. And albeit he knew theſe were gladſome ſignes, yet ſtanding faſt ſtill, as it were, upon his guard, he kept himſelfe within the bounds of Dacia, fearing even for all this, many accidents: for he thought it no point of wiſedome to truſt in conjectures, which peradventure would fall out contrarie. Whiles hee ſtood thus doubtfull and in ſuſpence, behold all on a ſuddaine there came as em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours ſent unto him, <hi>Theolaiphus</hi> and <hi>Aligildus,</hi> with tidings, That <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was deceaſed: and ſaying moreover, That by the laſt words he ſpake he nuncupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him ſucceſſor in his imperiall throne. Which being knowne, after he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from dangerous broyles and troublous ſtirres of warre, hee bare himſelfe wonderous high: and now beleeving propheſies, and making uſe of his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, namely, how expedition in his affaires had diverſe times ſtood him in much ſteed, hee gave knowledge by proclamation of his journey into Thracia: and ſo advauncing forward his enſignes in an happie houre, after hee had paſſed through the bending and hanging ſtraits of the Succi, hee marched on to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippopolis, in old time called Eumolpias, and all thoſe with a cheerefull pace fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

For they well conſidered, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which they went by force to win, and that with the feare of extreame perils, was now beyond their hope graunted unto him by the ordinarie courſe of right. And as the uſuall manner of Fame is, to amplifie all novelties, hee haſtened from thence, mounted higher and higher, as it were in ſome chariot of <hi>Triptolemus,</hi> who for his ſwift paſſage round about in the aire, fabulous antiquitie ſayth, rode upon winged dragons: and thus dread by land and ſea, having no wals to withſtand him, he entred into <note n="*" place="margin">Heraclia, <hi>Ortel.</hi>

But confeſſed it muſt be, that he highly maintained the moſt part of them as the verie ſeed-plot of all vices, in ſo much as they infected the Commonwealth with their lewd luſts and wicked deſires, and did hurt to many, more by example, than by libertie of ſinning: For ſome of them fed with the ſpoyles of churches, and out of everie occaſion ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling after lucre, being rayſed from baſe beggerie to ſo high a leape of great wealth and riches, held no meaſure either in profuſe largeſſe, or in poling, or in waſting, as thoſe that alwayes had beene accuſtomed by extortion and pillage to get other mens goods into their hands.

Among which enormities grew alſo the foule ſinks and deepe gulfes of waſtfull banquets, and in ſtead of triumphes for victories, feaſting with triumphes. Then came up the wearing of ſilkes and velvets without all ſpare: then encreaſed the artificiall skill of weaving and embroderie, together with the curious cunning of cookerie: then were large plots for ſumptuous and richly decked houſes layd for, the ſpatious modell of which, if the Conſull <hi>Quintius</hi> ſhould have poſſeſſed in lands he had loſt even after his Dictatorſhip the glory of his povertie. To theſe ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes and ſtaines in Court, were adjoyned the enormious tranſgreſſions of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in campe, when the ſouldiour inſtead of a joyfull ſhout, ſtudied to ſing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſonnets: neither had the armed man, as before time, a ſtone to couch himſelfe upon, but feathers and delicat winding beds: now were their drinking pots more weightie than their ſwords, for they ſhamed now to drinke out of earthen veſſell. Moreover, there was now ſeeking for houſes built of marble, whereas wee find it written in auncient records, That a ſouldiour of Sparta was ſharply chaſtiſed, for that during the time of warre abroad, he durſt be ſeene within houſe. Moreover, the ſouldiours in thoſe dayes were to their allyes and countrey-men ſo ſtout, and withall ſo given to extortion but contrariwiſe to their enemies ſo falſe harted, and cowardous, that having by ambitious ſuits and idleneſſe gotten wealth, they could moſt skilfully diſtinguiſh the varietie that was in gold and pretious ſtones: farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than we find in records of later date. For well knowne it is, that in the time of <hi>Maximian Caeſar,</hi> when a fort or campe of the king of Perſia was rifled, a certaine common ſouldiour after he had met with a Parthicke ſacbell, wherein were perles, upon ſimplicitie, for want of skill and knowledge, threw out the gemmes, and went away ſufficiently contented with the beautie onely of the lether bagge. It fortuned about the ſame time, that a certaine Barber being commaunded to come and pole the Emperours head, entred in arrayed in rich and coſtly apparell, whom when <hi>Iulian</hi> ſaw, he was much aſtonied, <hi>I</hi> (quoth he) <hi>commaunded not a</hi>

Whereat being moved and diſpleaſed, he diſcharged away all ſuch, together with Cookes and others of the like ſort (who were wont to recive in manner the ſame fees) as thoſe whom he had little need of, and gave them licence to paſſe whither they would. And albeit from the verie firſt inſtructions of his childhood, he was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven much to the worſhip of idols and <hi rend="sup">i</hi> heathen gods, &amp; as he grew by little &amp; little elder, became zealouſly affected to the ſame, as ſtanding infeare of many things, yet ſome points thereto appertaining he practiſed as ſecretly as poſſibly he could. But when thoſe matters being paſt and gone which he feared, &amp; he perceived once the time of libertie was come wherein he might do what he liſt, then diſcovered he the ſecrets of his heart, &amp; by verie plaine and abſolute decrees ordained, That the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſhould be ſet open, that beaſts for ſacrifice ſhould bee preſented before the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and that the worſhip of the <note n="*" place="margin">

And to effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuat and ſtrengthen theſe deſignes of his ſo digeſted, the Chriſtian biſhops which were at diſſention, together with the people divided into ſchiſmes, he admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his pallace, and gave them this admonition, That having appeaſed and ended all civile diſcords among themſelves, everie man confidently ſhould profeſſe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his owne religion, without any impeachment whatſoever: which he did with a ſtiffe and conſtant purpoſe, to this end, that as this libertie encreaſed diſcentions, he might not afterwards feare the multitude of them according in one mind, as having found by experience, That no ſavage beaſts are ſo noiſom and hurtful to men, as Chriſtians are to themſelves, and for the moſt part of them mortall and deadly. And oftentimes he would come out with theſe words, <hi>Heare me, whom the Alemans and Frankners have heard,</hi> thinking to imitat the ſpeech of that auncient Prince <hi>Marcus.</hi> But little marked he, that the caſe was much altered: For, the ſayd <hi>Marcus,</hi> when he travailed over Paleſtina, in his way to Aegypt, beeing oftentimes diſquieted with the odious and ſtinking ſturres of the tumultuous and unruly Iewes in griefe of heart is ſaid to have taken up this exclamation, <hi>ô Marcomans, ô Quadi, ô Sarmatians, I have at length found others more unquiet than you.</hi>

And when they would ſuffer no buſineſſe elſe to bee diſpatched, <hi>Iulian</hi> publiſhed a proclamation, commanding them all to paſſe over the water unto Chalcedon, with a promiſe, that himſelfe alſo in perſon would follow quickly after, to decide and determine theſe their cauſes.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Eane while, preparing an expedition againſt the Perſians, which in the highneſſe and ſtoutneſſe of his mind he had conceived before time, caried aloft he was with an hote deſire to the revenge of diſhonours paſt, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hearing, that this moſt fierce nation had for the ſpace almoſt of threeſcore yeares together ſet their ſure markes and cruell monuments in the Eaſt of ſlaughter and ſaccage, as having oftentimes put whole armies of ours to the ſword. Now, a twofold deſire he had that incenſed him to this warre: firſt, for that impatient alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of eaſe and reſt, he dreamed of nothing all night but trumpets and battailes: againe, becauſe in the very prime and flower of his youth, being preſented and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the warres of cruell nations, whiles the prayers were yet freſh of kings and princes, who were thought might be vanquiſhed by force of armes, rather than hold forth their hands by way of humble ſupplication, he had an ardent deſire, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other ornaments of braverie and glorie, to inſert in his ſtyle the addition and ſurname of <hi>Parthicus:</hi> which impreaſe of his, when ſome idle and envious backbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſaw to be ſet forward with great preparations, they kept a muttering, and gave it out, That it was a foule indignitie and pernitious, that by the exchange of one only bodie there ſhould ſo many ſtirres and troubles be raiſed, employing all their endevour and diligence in putting off this ſervice and journey. Yea, and they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid, even in the preſence of thoſe, who they ſuppoſed would bring what they heard to the Emperours eare, That unleſſe he went more calmely to worke in this exceſſive proſperitie and ſucceſſe of his affaires, he would (like as corne that is growne over-ranke and plentifull, ſoone fall to the ground, and lye along with the weight of his owne wealth and felicitie. And thus harping much a long time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſtring, with ſecret plots and cloſe devices they came barking in vaine about this valiant man (who was nothing moved hereat) much like unto the Pygmaeans or ζ <hi>Thiodamas,</hi> that ruſticall peſant of Lydia, about <hi>Hercules.</hi> But he for all this, as beeing of an haughtier ſpirit than all the reſt, never the later caſting and deviſing with himſelfe the greatneſſe of this voyage, endevoured earneſtly to prepare all things meet and convenient therefore. Notwithſtanding all this, I ſay, he drenched and embrued the altars exceeding oft, with much ſhedding of bloud, ſacrificing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhiles an hundred buls at once, and infinite flockes of ſundrie ſmaller beaſts, yea, and white ſheepe ſought for and gotten farre and neere by land and ſea: ſo that the ſouldiors every day, in manner, that went over their heads, full pampered and

Moreover, the rites of ſuperſtitious ceremonies were come to an exceſſive height with greatneſſe of expence, before time unuſuall and grievous to be endured: and every man (ſince he might doe any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impeachment) profeſſing knowledge in propheſie, as well the ignorant and unskilfull, as the learned and taught ſcholler, without all end, or any orders appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beforehand, were permitted to ſeeke after the anſwers given by oracles, and the ſcience of peering into beaſts bowels, which now and then diſcover future events: yea, &amp; the faithfull information, where ever it might be found, of birds by ſinging, of fowles by flying, and of oſſes let fall from the mouth, were with ſtudious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of varietie ſought for. And whiles theſe matters run on thus, as in time of peace, <hi>Iulian,</hi> who was very ſtudious and diligent to learne many things, entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a new way of conſultation, minding to lay open the propheticall and ſoothſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing veins of the Caſtalian fountaine, which <hi>Hadrianus Caeſar</hi> is ſaid to have ſtopped up with an huge heape of great ſtones, fearing, leaſt as himſelfe found by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the waters, that he was to take the charge and government of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale; ſo others alſo might come by knowledge of the like: and-forthwith appointed, that the bodies which had beene enterred round about it, ſhould bee tranſlated from thence after that manner and faſhion, as the Athenians had purged the Iſle Delos.

Which being thus by ſo terrible a misfortune conſumed, ſo farre forth grew the Emperour wroth and angrie, that hee commaunded more ſtreight and ſharper inquiſitions to be holden than ordinarie, and the Cathedrall church of Antiochia to be ſhut up: for he imagined, that the Chriſtians had done that deed upon ſpight and envie, for that againſt their wils they ſaw as an eye-ſore the ſayd temple encloſed round about with a ſumptuous cloyſter, ſupported with pillars.

And albeit there were many more together with theſe, whom I have named, that flouriſhed here in old time, yet in the ſame citie the profeſſions of ſundrie ſorts of knowledge are not even in theſe daies ſilent: for both the maſters of Mathematickes, after a ſort here breath and live ſtill, and whatſoever lyeth darke and hidden, is diſcovered and layed open by the Geometricians ſtaffe: neither as yet among them is Muſicke altogether decayed and gone, nor harmonie huſht: and even yet among ſome, blacke though they be, the skill and obſervation of the heavens motion and of the ſtarres is hotely profeſſed againe; and in one word learned there be among them not a few. Over and beſides, cunning they are in the ſcience of propheſie and divination, which openeth the courſes of the Deſtinies. And as for Phyſicke, whereof, in this life of ours (which can little skill of tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſobrietie) the many helps and meanes are right requiſite and needfull, the ſtudie and practiſe therof encreaſeth daily ſo, that although it ſtand moſt upon pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe and experience, yet in lieu of al experiments, it ſufficeth for a Phyſitian to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the authoritie of his skill, if he doe but ſay, That he was trained up therein, at Alexandria, And thus much verily may ſerve as touching theſe matters. But if any man wil with a quicke underſtanding revolve the manifold introductions into the intelligence of Divinitie, and the originall of fore-knowing things to come, he ſhall find that ſuch kind of learning was from Aegypt carryed and ſpread over the whole world. Here firſt, men long before others, came to the ſundrie rudiments and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, as they ſay, of Religion: and the firſt principles of their ſacred myſteries, they warily keepe and ſave, beſtowed in ſecret ſanctuaries.

From theſe fountaines glorious Wiſedome, in imitation of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> marching on high with brave and loftie words, having not ſeene Aegypt, hath as it were in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare diſplayed her banners.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:14644:114"/>
As for the Scorpion, which now they call Onager, this is the forme thereof. There be two plankes hewen of Oke or Helme, and thoſe are ſomewhat curbed, ſo as they may ſeeme to beare up or ſtand out with backes; and theſe in manner of a <note n="*" place="margin">Serratoria ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinae.</note> Saw-machine are tied faſt together, as being bored through on both ſides with good wide holes, between which through the holes are ſtrong ropes tied, keeping in the whole frame together, that it flye and ſtart not aſunder. From the very midſt of theſe ropes there riſeth forth a beame of wood overthwart, and after the faſhion of a yoke ſpire or tiller erected, which is tied with cords or ſtrings at ſuch meaſures and gages, that it may be ſet up or let downe lower: and to the top thereof are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned yron hookes, from which there hangeth a ſling-ſocket of tow or yron: under which piece of wood there lyeth a huge great bouttriſſe or ſupporter, even hayre-cloth ſtuffed full of ſmall ſtraw and chaffe, faſtened thereto with ſtrong bindings, and planted upon turfes heaped up together, or elſe a banke raiſed with raw bricks: for ſuch a mightie engine as this beeing ſet upon a wall of ſtone, forceth aſunder and breaketh what ever it findeth under it; not for the weight, but the violent ſhake that it giveth. When as therefore it is come to the point of skirmiſh or fight, and that a round ſtone is put into the ſling, foure luſtie young men on the one ſide unfolding the barres whereto the ropes are incorporate, draw backe the ſtyle or ſtandard up to the hooke: and ſo at length the maſter of the Engine ſtanding aloft, giving a mightie ſtroke with an hammer, ſetteth open the rayles that containe the binding of the whole worke: whereupon the ſtandard being now at libertie with that quicke ſtroke, and hitting againſt the ſoft haire-cloth aforeſaid, hurleth out the ſtone that will batter whatſoever is in the way. And verily it is called <hi>Tormentum,</hi> for that out of it all the unfolding is whirled and hurled out: but a Scorpion (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſtanding upright, it hath a ſharpe pricke above; unto which alſo the moderne time hath impoſed the name of Onager, <hi>i.</hi> a wild aſſe, in this regard, that wild aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes when they are courſed by hunters) fling with their heeles ſtones afarre off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their backs, ſo as they pierce through the breaſts of them that follow in chaſe, or breake the skuls of their heads, and daſh out their braines. Hence will we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Ram. There is choice made of an high Firre or wild Aſh, the one end whereof is ſhod with an hard plate of yron and a long, ſhaped out in the front like unto a Ram, which forme gave the name to this engine or battering piece: and thus hanged up with overthwart plankes on both ſides, and yron hoopes of another piece of timber, held up it is as it were in balance: and the ſame according as the meaſure or length thereof will permit, a number of men driving backe, thruſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward againe to breake whatſoever ſtandeth againſt it, with mightie ſtrokes &amp; maine jurres, in manner of an armed man that commeth upon one and giveth aſſault. By the manifold puſhes whereof, as it were the violent force of a thunderbolt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to and fro, buildings are rent, and made to cleave and chawne, yea, and the joynts of wals being ſhaken and loſened, fall downe. By this kind of worke, if it be driven backe by maine ſtrength put thereto (and let goe againe) rampiers are lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed naked of their defendants, and the ſtrongeſt cities that be, are with the caſe of ſiege layed open. In ſtead of theſe devices of Rams, deſpiſed now, becauſe they were ſo common, there is an engine framed, well knowne to Hiſtoriographers, which the Greekes name Helepolis: by the meanes and long uſe whereof, <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> after he had given the aſſault unto Rhodes and other cities, was called Poliorcetes: and built it is in this manner. There is a mightie Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtudo or frame made, ſtrengthened with very long pieces of timber, and fitted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:14644:114"/>
with yron ſpikes, and the ſame covered with ox-hides and new rods or win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings drawne one within another, the roofe or upmoſt part whereof is beſtrewed and layed over with mud, to the end it may checke the fall of fire or ſhot of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting-weapons. Now, there are ſet faſt in the front of it certaine ſharpe-pointed yron pikes or heads, with three edges, very maſſie, much like in ſhape to thoſe light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings or thunderbolts, that painters or forgers exhibite unto it; to the end, that whatſoever it runneth againſt, it may with thoſe ſharpe heads that ſo beare out, batter and breake in pieces. This ſo ſtrong and huge a frame, the ſouldiors within ruling with wheeles and a number of ropes, drive with maine and ſpeedie force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the weaker part of a wall: and unleſſe the defendants from above bee the ſtronger, and quit themſelves the better, it beateth downe the walls, and maketh wide breaches. As for the Malleoli, a kind of Darts, ſhaped they be on this faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: There is an arrow made of a cane, betwixt the head and the ſteile, joined and couched cloſe with an yron full of chamfers and teeth: which arrow, after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a womans <note n="*" place="margin">or rocke.</note> diſtaffe, on which they ſpin linnen thred, is finely made hollow within the bellie, yet open in many places thereof, and in the bellie or hollowneſſe it receiveth fire with ſome <note n="*" place="margin">as namely, Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Nuphta.</note> fuell to feed it; and thus being diſcharged ſoftly out of a weake bow (for with violent ſhooting the fire goeth out) if it take faſt hold on any place, it burneth the ſame: and having water caſt or ſprinckled upon it, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fire it cauſeth, neither is there any remedie to allay or quench the rage thereof, but by flinging duſt upon it. Thus much as touching peeces of Ordnance for walls, of which ſome few have beene ſhewed. Now returne we to the orderly courſe of our Hyſtorie.</p>

Howbeit, rejecting the advertiſement of this moſt ſage and wiſe counſellor, hee boldly advaunced forward ſtill: for why, <hi>Never was there any power or proweſſe of man able to merit and prevaile ſo much, but that which the fatall order of Deſtinies had once preſcribed, muſt needs take effect.</hi> And forthwith, having paſſed over the river, hee cauſed the bridge to bee plucked in ſunder and had away, that the ſouldiors might have no confidence or hope remaining, to returne backe from their proper companies and regiments. In like ſort here alſo was ſeene a ſight praeſaging heavie and unluckie fortune, to wit, the dead corpes lying along of a certaine officer or purveyor, executed by the hangmans hand, whom <hi>Salluſtius</hi> the Pręfect being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentin place, had condemned to ſuffer death and looſe his head, for that having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his promiſe, to deliver an encreaſe of victuals within a day prefixed, was by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a cauſe of impeachment diſappointed, and did fruſtrate mens expectation. But when the poore man (a pitifull caſe) was done to death, the very next morrow, as he had made promiſe, arrived another fleet fraight with plentie of corne and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall.

Now, whereas this diſcourſe ſhall fall out to be ſomewhat long, availe it will to the perfect knowledge of the thing. For whoſoever hee bee, that in the narration of unknowne matters affecteth too much brevitie, he ſeeketh not that ſo much which he ſhould verie plainely declare, but what ought indeed to be overpaſſed. This kingdome in times paſt ſmall, and for ſuch cauſes as I have oft related, called before time by many names, what time as <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, was taken away by untimely death in Babylon, became ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>Arſaces</hi> the Parthian, a man of obſcure parentage, and no better in his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dayes than a ring-leader of theeves: but by little and little turning over a leafe, and changing his purpoſe to the better, by a continued courſe and traine of noble deedes, he advanced himſelfe to an high eſtate: Who after he had atchieved many glorious and valiant exploits, vanquiſhed <hi>Seleucus Nicator</hi> that ſucceeded the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> (who for his manifold victories obtained that ſirname) and driven out the garriſons of the Macedonians, himſelfe leading a more peaceable life, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a moderat ruler, and mild judge of ſuch as yeelded obedience. And in the end, when he had ſubdued unto him all the borderers, either by force of armes, or by a due conſideration of his equitie, or elſe by feare, ſo that Perſia now was repleniſhed with fortified cities, ſtrong caſtles and pyles, and became dread unto all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour inhabitants, of whom afore time it was woont to ſtand in feare, himſelfe in the middle race of his age departed this life in peace. And by the uniforme accord and conſent as well of the noble Peeres, as the common people, ſtriving a vie who
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:14644:117"/>
might be moſt forward, became the firſt, that according to the due rites of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration was inſerted (as they be perſuaded) and ranged among the ſtarres. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in thoſe dayes the high minded and prowd kings of the ſame nation can well abide to be ſtyled the brethren of Sunne and Moone. And like as our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours love well and wiſh the title of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> even ſo to the Parthian kings (who before time were abject, ignoble, and baſe) through the happie auſpices and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Arſaces,</hi> there accrewed even the greateſt titles of dignities that might be: and therefore they worſhip and adore him no leſſe than a god, and ſo farre forth are his honours ſpred and enlarged, that even to our very dayes, there is not a prince preferred before all other to the rule of that kingdome, unleſſe hee bee of the line and race of <hi>Arſaces:</hi> yea, and in every civile brawle and contention, which dayly happen among them, there is not one but avoideth, no leſſe than ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, to lay violent hands upon any, deſcended from <hi>Arſaces,</hi> beare he armes, or be he otherwiſe a private perſon. And well knowne it is, that this nation ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving vanquiſhed and ſubdued many States, dilated the bounds of their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as farre as Propontis and Thracia; how ever, through the pride of their hautie minded leaders, who licentiouſly encroched upon farre countries, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted outrages there, by receiving very great foyles and overthrowes, it became much impaired.

Now will I ſet downe the ſituation of the places therein as ſummarily and briefely as reaſon will permit. Theſe countries lying out largely ſpread in length and breadth, environ about on every ſide the Perſian gulfe, ſo full of Iſlands, ſo famous, and ſo much frequented: the mouthes of which ſea are by report ſo narrow, that from <note n="*" place="margin">Cabo Laſquette, <hi>Ortel.</hi>

When as therefore yee have ſayled through the foreſaid ſtraits, yee come to the gulfe of Armenia, lying into the Eaſt: and after a certaine diſtance betweene, occaſioned by a necke or Iſthm of land, there openeth a Bay or Gulfe in the South, named Cantichus; not farre from whence there is another, which they tearme Chalites, under the Sunneſetting.

Which ancient manner of the Greeks the Athenians firſt layed away, as <hi>Thucydides,</hi> a moſt ſufficient author, recordeth.

muzzeled and bound up are all their lips with prickly and ſharpe pointed skinnes. The lawes with them are mightily feared, among which for ſeveritie and rigour thoſe exceed, that are enacted againſt unthankfull perſons and traiterous revolts: and others there are as deteſtable and to be abhorred, by vertue whereof, for the offence of one man all the kinred muſt die. To ſit in judgement and decide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, are ſuch appointed, as are for worldly experience tried, and of approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved integritie, who alſo little or nothing at all need the counſell of others: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they laugh at our cuſtome, which otherwhiles ſetteth eloquent Orators and moſt learned in the common lawes, at the backe of unlearned Iudges, to prompt them. For, that another Iudge was forced to ſit upon the skin of that Iudge, who was condemned for unjuſtice and doing wrong, it was eyther a fained tale de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by thoſe in old time; or if it were an auncient received cuſtome, it hath had an end, and is no more put in practiſe. For militarie furniture and diſcipline, for continuall flouriſhes of encamping and uſing their armour and weapons, which I have oftentimes deſcribed, dreadfull they were even to the greateſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, boldly and confidently preſuming upon the proweſſe of their Cavallerie, in which ſervice all their nobilitie, gentrie, and gallants labour, that they ſweat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

The moſt part of them are ſo clad in garments, and the ſame glittering with ſundrie lightſome and bright colours, that although they leave the laps and ſides of them unſowne and looſe, to be ſhaken with puffes of wind, yet is there nothing ſeene uncovered from the crowne of their heads to their very ſhooes. After they had ſubdued India, and vanquiſhed Croeſus, they uſed to weare bracelets, ouches, and jewels of gold, precious ſtones alſo, but pearle eſpecially. And now occaſioned I am, by the matter ſo requiring, to deliver ſome few words ſuccinctly, as touching the generation of this gem or ſtone. Among the Indians and Perſians both are found theſe pearles, within ſtrong and bright ſhels of the ſea-fiſhes, conceived at a certaine time of the yeare by a commixtion of deaw. For theſe ſhell-fiſhes being deſirous to engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as it were, with a certaine humor, by often yawning and gaping catch it from an influence and ſprinckling of the Moone. And hereupon being conceived and great with young, they bring forth two or three little ones, or pearles called V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niones, for that the little ſhels of that land otherwhiles are delivered of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece, but the ſame are of a bigger ſize. And this is a good proofe and argument, that this young frie (as I may ſo tearme them) of pearles are hoth bred and fed rather with ſome influence from the skie or ayre above, than by any food that ſea doth yeeld, becauſe the drops of morning deaw, infuſed or drſtilling upon the ſame, maketh them bright and round ſtones; but the evening deawes cauſe them to be contrariwiſe ſoft and fluxible, yellow and reddiſh, yea, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles full of ſpots. Now faſhioned they are, as it falleth out, diverſly, either ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſmall, or great, according to the qualitie of the draughts they take of deaw.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:14644:122"/>
But oftentimes ſo ſhaken be theſe ſhell fiſhes with the feare of flaſhie lightenings, that they become emptie, or bring forth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To conclude, we are not ignorant, that this kind of gem is both engendred and gotten in the noukes and creckes of the Brittiſh ſea alſo, although they be not of like worth to thoſe of India.</p>

Now the fleet, although it paſſed along the river which with many winding and crooked reaches continnally turned in and out, was not ſuffered either to lag behind, or make ſpeed before. Thus therefore having gone two dayes journey, wee came to Dora, a citie forlorne and unpeopled, ſcituat upon the verie ſide of the river: In which place we happened upon many heards of ſtagges, whereof ſome ſhot into the bodie with caſting weapons, others knocked downe and brained with weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ores, fed us all, and gave us our fill: But the moſt of them being uſed to ſwimme, after they had paſſed over the ſwift ſtreame, ran away, and could not be ſtayed, but eſcaped unto their knowne woods and wilderneſſe.

And anone the Emperour himſelfe having from a verie high Tote-hill, or Barbican, viewed the ſcituation of the ſayd Pyle, and the fortifications about it, right ſpeedily by the helpe of two ſhips paſſeth over the river, and many other veſſels followed behind, which carryed engines and peeces of ordance for batterie. And now by this time approaching the walls, when he conſidered that there could be no aſſault or skirmiſh there without many daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, partly with gentle words, and in part with rough ſpeeches and threatning lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, he moved the defendants to yeeld: who calling for <hi>Ormiſda</hi> to a parley, and induced by his faire promiſe, and othes that he tooke, were much perſuaded of the Romans clemencie.

all the reſt with their wives, children, and houſhold goods, were ſent over in poore and ſimple array, to Chalcis a citie in Syria. Among theſe, a certaine ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, who had beene left ſicke in theſe parts, when <hi>Maximianus</hi> in times paſt forcibly invaded the frontiers of Perſia, a man then in the verie prime and flower of his youth, having, as he ſaid himſelfe, wedded many wives, according to the guiſe of that nation, being now farre ſtepped in yeares, and ſtooping for age, with a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous progenie much rejoicing, and the principall counſellor that perſuaded the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying and ſurrender of the fort, was brought into our province, affirming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and that by witneſſes, That long ſince hee both foreknew and foretold, that when he came to the poynt of being an hundred yeres old, he ſhold be enterred in Roman ground.

And the verie ſame day, there happened another accident no leſſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous: for, by occaſion that ſodainely the river overflowed his banks, certain ſhips that uſed to bring in corne were drowned by reaſon that the ſcluces or floudgates made of ſtone worke, to let out or reſtraine the waters, that uſed to water the fields, were plucked away: which whether it chanced by ſome treacherous practiſe, or through the violence of the ſtreame, it could never be knowne.</p>

And for that in countries unknowne there was to be had a more ſuſpicious care of ſecret and hidden practiſes, they much feared the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſleights of the nation, and their ſundrie deviſes to delude and deceive them. Wherefore, the Emperour one while marching in the vauntguard before the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, another while buſie in leading the rereward, with a company of nymble skirmiſhers, lightly appointed, ſearched and ſcoured the rough places ful of ſhrubs, and the vallyes, leaſt ſome ſecret ambuſh ſhould lye hidden within: reſtrayning withal, either by way of affabilitie and faire language (which was naturally in him) or by threats, thoſe ſouldiors who even licentiouſly and raſhly would ſtraggle to and fro afarre off: yet permitted he the enemies fields rich in all kind of fruits, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ſtanding corne and their cottages to be ſet on fire, but not before everie man had gathered neceſſarie proviſion for himſelfe in great aboundance: and by this meanes was the life and health of the enemies wounded, ere they knew

For, our fighting men tooke much pleaſure to make uſe of what they had gotten with their owne right hands, ſuppoſing they had now found other garners of their vertue and valour; and rejoycing, that they having plentifull ſtore of the means alſo to maintain life, they ſaved the victuals that were ſhipped and conveied by water. And here a certaine fool-hardie ſouldior, when his head was ful of wine, without any urgent need driving him thereto, would needs paſſe over to the bank on the further ſide of the river, &amp; there within our ſight was taken by the enemies, and killed. Theſe deſigns, with ſuch an accident between, performed, we came to a ſtrong fortreſſe or caſtle, named Thilutha, ſcituat in the mids of the river, a place mounting up with a certaine mightie high top, and by naturall ſtrength fenced round about, as it were by the worke of mans hand. The inhabitants whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by gentle meanes ſolicited to ſurrender it, as meet it was, for that the rough and craggie height thereof was by force of armes imprenable, ſaid plainely, That it was unſeaſonable then and overtimely to revolt: But thus farre forth they gaged their anſwer, That when the Romans marching on forward ſhould become ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the more inland parts, they alſo as the followers and tayle of a kingdome, would joine with the conquerors. And after this, as our ſhips paſſed along cloſe to the verie wals, with a modeſt kind of quietneſſe, without any ſtir at all, they viewed them.

The wealth of this nation is able to enrich us all, in caſe with one heart and accord we beare our ſelves manfully. The Romane Commonwealth, trust me truly, is from infinite riches become exceeding poore, and even by thoſe, who to fill their owne purſes, have perſuaded Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours to returne home with peace, that the ſavages and barbarous have bought for gold.

Now, the manner was of <hi>Iulian</hi> to animate his armie, ſwearing evermore, not by ſuch things as were deere unto him, but by the great exploits and affaires that were begun; as for example, <hi>So might hee ſubdue the</hi>

After this, I ſay, when we had paſſed foureteene myles forward, wee came to a certaine place that with abundant overflow of waters enricheth the fields and maketh them plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull: which way the Perſians being informed that we would goe, plucked up the floud-gates, and ſuffered the waters to flow and ſpread all abroad. By reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the ground ſtood all as it were on a ſtanding poole, the ſecond day the Emperour giving his ſouldiors reſt, went forth himſelfe, and on many floored brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges made of <hi rend="sup">f</hi> leather bougets and ſhips ſupported with pyles, as alſo of hewen logs and plankes of Date tree, with much difficultie he tranſported his armie. In theſe countries there be many fields planted with Vines and ſundrie ſorts of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full trees, where Date trees are wont to grow, and take up a great deale of ground, reaching in manner of mightie forreſts as farre as to <note n="*" place="margin">or Adiabene. <hi>Botan Caſtaldo.</hi>

It is reported moreover, That the females annointed with the ſeed of the male, doe conceive and beare, yea, and by report, they delight in mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all love: which appeareth hereby, in that they doe bend in the head and leane one againſt another, ſo as that they are not with the very puffing blaſts of wind turned another way. And in caſe the female according to the uſuall manner, be not ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared with the ſeed of the male, ſhe looſeth by an abortive defect her untimely fruit: and if it be not well knowne what tree it is that the female is in love with, the ſtocke or ſtem of it is beſmeared with the ointment thereof, and then the other tree naturally conceiveth the ſweet odour, and ſo by theſe tokens is bewrayed the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainetie, as it were, of their generation. With this food the armie repleniſhed plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, paſſed by many Iſlands, and where they were afraid before of want and ſcarcitie, there they feared fulneſſe and ſurfeit.

And now by this time our Emperour having encircled with a threefold courſe of ſhields, the towne, aforeſaid, which had a double wall about it, in hope to atchieve his enterpriſe, with maine force gave the aſſault. But as the attempt was neceſſarie, ſo the effecting ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was moſt difficult: for, the avenue unto it, being on everie ſide for the danger thereof doubtfull, by reaſon that the cliffes aloft in their turning were <hi rend="sup">i</hi> cloven and rent, as alſo for that their aſcents and tops were full of crooked windings, denyed them all meanes of acceſſe; eſpecially, for that the towers ſtanding ſo thicke and high, made a terrible ſhew, and were equall in height to the craggie mount natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

riſing aloft, on which the citadell ſtood, and the plaine deſcent falling to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſide, was fortified with ſtrong bulwarkes. To all theſe difficulties, there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother miſchiefe no leſſe troubleſome than the reſt, namely, that the beſieged, who were a picked number of valiant men, &amp; furniſhed with ſtore everie way, could by no allurements be induced to yeeld, but as making full account either to win the victorie, or devow and betake themſelves to be conſumed with the aſhes of their countrey, withſtood their enemies. Now, by this time were our ſouldiors hardly and with much ado held backe, advancing themſelves fooliſhly and prowdly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, calling alſo for fight even in plaine field, and ſet battaile: yea and when the retrait was ſounded, ſtill pricked on they were with couragious ſtomacke and hot endevour to preaſſe upon the enemie. Howbeit the counſell of our captaines o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame at length that exceeding forwardneſſe and violence of theirs: and ſo when the ſervice and worke was divided, everie man moſt ſpeedily taketh him to his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall charge appointed unto him. For, of the one ſide were rayſed high mounts and terraces, on the other ſide ſome filled up the deepe ditches, and made them le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell with the ground, whiles others were buſie elſewhere in making hollow tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with paſſages along within the earth. There were cunning Mechanikes alſo, that planted engines &amp; peeces of ordnance, to batter the wals, ſuch as wold as they were diſcharged make a horrible and deadly noyſe. And verily of undermining and the fabrickes fore-covert and defence, <hi>Nevita</hi> and <hi>Dagalaiphus</hi> had the charge: but the Emperour himſelfe gave direction for skirmiſh, as alſo for ſaving the frames and engines as wel from fire as ſallies. And when as all the preparation for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw &amp; raſing of the city, with much painful labor was finiſhed, and nothing now but fight called for, Marqueſſe <hi>Victor</hi> returned, who having ſounded and diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all the wayes as farre as to Cteſiphon, brought word, That hee found no ſtops or lets in his journey: For joy of which newes, all the ſouldiors were ſo ſet a god, and bare ſo confident and reſolute minds to fight, that they armed preſently, and waited for the ſignall to proceed unto the aſſault.</p>

Then alſo the Baliſts bent and fitted with ſhafts of wood were wreſted up and diſcharged with a great noyſe, ſending forth headed arrowes exceeding thicke: the Scorpions likewiſe whither ſoever by skilful hand they were directed, diſcharged from them round ſtones. Thus, after redoubled conflicts one upon another, the heat of the weather ſtill encreaſing untill noone (by reaſon that the Sunne did caſt ſcorching hot vapours from him) called them all away, as buſie as they were in preparation of their workes, and deſirous of fight, being tyred out, and running all to ſweat. With the ſame purpoſe and ſetled reſolution, the day alſo following both parts bickering one with another in ſundrie ſorts of fight, depart on even hand neither winners nor looſers. But at everie hard pinch and daungerous ſervice, the prince in perſon joyning cloſe to the fighting men, called inſtantly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, to have the citie forced and deſtroyed, becauſe hee would not lye long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the walls, and overſlip greater deſignes that he projected. But as it falleth out in caſes of urgent extremitie, there is nothing ſo ſlight and ſmall, but otherwhiles, even contrarie to all hope and expectation, it yeeldeth occaſion and advantage of greater matters. For, when as both ſides fought ſo faintly, as if oftentimes they had beene at the point to depart aſunder, behold, by the ſtroke of a Ram long time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed, and which a little before was brought againſt the wall, downe came a tower higher than all the reſt, and built moſt ſtrongly of bricke; the fall whereof brought after it with a mightie craſh, that ſide of the wall that joined unto it. Then and there by occaſion of ſundrie accidents and occurrents, the painfull labour of the beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and the diligent induſtrie of the beſieged, was notably ſhewed by brave and worthy exploits. For our fighting ſouldiers were ſo enkindled with anger and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, that they thought no ſervice hard, and the defendants running as they did, and beſtirring themſelves for life, nothing was dread and terrible. Now, when the fight had continued hot a long time in even ballance, and doubtfull tearmes, after much bloudſhed, and many a man ſlaine on both parts, it determined with the end of the day, and ſo at length reſpect and conſideration was had of their weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And whiles theſe things were a doing in open day light, word was brought unto the Emperour, full of watchfull care, That the legionarie ſouldiors, who had the charge of digging trenches and undermining, after they had wrought under ground hollow wayes, and upheld them with props, had pierced through the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie foundations beneath, readie now to riſe above the ground, if hee did ſo direct them. When as therefore the moſt part of the night was paſt, upon ſignall given by ſound of trumpets, to go forth, running there was on all hands to arme and to fight: and on purpoſe the aſſault was given on both ſides affront the walls, that whiles the defendants are skudding to and fro about the walls, to put by and repell daungers, ſo that neither the tinging ſound of the yron tooles digging hard by could bee heard, nor any man remained within forth to make reſiſtance, a companie of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners all on a ſodaine ſhew their heads. Which being ſo ordered, as agreed it was before, and the defendants buſily occupied, and the lurking caves layed open, up ſtarteth firſt a ſouldior, one of the number that before was overcome, after whom <hi>Magnus</hi> a Tribune, and <hi>Iovianus</hi> a Notarie, whom a bold and hardie multitude fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, after they had ſtabbed thoſe whom they found in the houſe, through which they came forth to light, marching on ſoftly with a ſilent pace, they killed all the watchmen, as they were with lowd and ſhrill voyces extolling, as the manner is and cuſtome of that nation, the juſtice and felicitie of their king. Thought it was ſometime, that <hi>Mars</hi> himſelfe in perſon (if the lawes of divine majeſtie permit that

When the ſaccage therefore was divided and dealt, with conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of everie mans deſert and paines taken, himſelfe (as hee was one that ſtood content with a little) tooke for his ſhare a dumbe boy, brought unto him, one of theſe tumblers and dauncers kind, who alſo could expreſſe by moſt lovely and daintie jeſtures, what he had skill of, and valued at <hi rend="sup">l</hi> three peeces of gold, him (I ſay) he tooke for a pleaſant and acceptable reward (as he eſteemed it) of victorie obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

In the time of theſe conflicts the Architect and maſter Carpenter of our ſide, whoſe name commeth not to my remembrance, as he chaunced to ſtand behind the engine of a Scorpion, by the reverberation or recoyling backe of a ſtone, which the enginer had beſtowed looſe and tottering in the ſling ſocket, was ſtrucken downe therewith on his backe, and his breaſt ſo ſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,

that preſently he loſt his life withall: and the knitting of his joynts was ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned and torne in ſunder, as that the tokens verily of his whole bodie could not be knowne. As the Emperour went forward on his journey from thence, there was one enformed him for certaine, That about the wals of the towne thus ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there was a companie lay cloſe in ambuſh within certaine deceitfull and blind caves, ſuch as there be many in thoſe tracts: to the end, that from thence at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, they might ſet upon the backe part of our armie, and have the killing of the hindmoſt.

Thus a large and populous citie raſed by the proweſſe of Roman forces, fell to duſt and utter ruine. After which ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exploits, when we had paſſed over divers bridges joyning one to another by reaſon of the concourſe of many rivers, we came unto two forts, built with hollow and vaulted houſes: where the kings ſonne advauncing forward from Cteſiphon, with many nobles, and a multitude in armes, went about to debarre <hi>Victor</hi> the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, as he went before the armie, from paſſage over the river: but hee having once ſpied the companies of our ſouldiers following, he went his way.

Whereat the Emperour being wroth, and for anger gnaſhing his teeth, tooke his journey forward, and approching now the territorie about Cte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiphon, he met with an high caſtle and paſſing well fortified, to the view whereof he adventured to goe neere, being unknowne and unſeene, as himſelfe thought, and with a few in his companie rode about the walls: but when hee was found once to engage himſelfe over-farre, even within the reach of dart-ſhot, he could no longer be unknowne: and preſently, being courſed and aſſayled with a voley and cloud, as it were, of ſundrie caſting-weapons, ſlaine he had beene with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine from the walls, but that, after his Eſquire or armour-bearer that ſtucke cloſe to his ſide was wounded, himſelfe covered with a roufe of ſhields couched cloſe together, eſcaped this great danger and departed.

Whiles theſe things are thus in doing, the Perſians in like manner as before, from the oppoſite river banke ſetting upon a part of our men, killed ſome, and tooke others alive: and withall, for very feare, becauſe the enemies were thought to have come with a greater number, our ſouldiors as then beſtirred themſelves but ſlowly. But when they had taken heart againe, and were growne more bold, ſo that in the

After this, in heat of revenge he converted all his diligence and care to the ſubverſion of that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle where he was in ſuch jeopardie, himſelfe in perſon ſtirring not a foot any way from the vauntguard, that fighting ſo among the formoſt, he might give the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors good example to behave themſelves valiantly, as being a beholder and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover of their acts. And after hee had beene a long time much converſant in the very higheſt extremities of danger, at length, ſuch was the varietie of munitions and weapons, ſuch was the joint reſolution alſo of his fighting men, that the ſame caſtle was woon, ſacked and burnt. And after this, conſidering the dangerous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and occurrences both paſt, and alſo readie to enſue, the armie out-toyled and tyred with exceſſive paines, reſted, and had plentie of many things meet for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation of this life, dealt among them. Howbeit, from thenceforth the rampier and fence of the campe was more ſurely fortified with a palliſado of ſtakes ſtanding thicke, and with deepe trenches, ſeeing that now they feared from Cteſiphon ſo neere at hand, ſuddaine outrodes and other privie practiſes. Hence we came to the river digged by mans hand, named Naarmalcha, which by interpretation is as much as the Kings river, the channell whereof was then drie. This river <hi>Traiane</hi> beforetime, &amp; afterwards <hi>Severus,</hi> had with paſſing great care cauſed to be digged, and the earth to be caſt up in manner of a mightie large gutter or chanell, to the end that by a water-courſe derived thither from Euphrates, ſhipping might paſſe to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris. And in all reſpects it was thought the ſafeſt policie to have the ſame place cleanſed, which in times paſt the Perſians fearing the like accidents, had ſtopped up with a dam of many big ſtones layed together. And after this Botone was skoured, with a mightie deale of water let in upon the plucking away of the ſluce, the fleet which had beene driven backe for the ſpace of thirtie ſtadia, was caſt with ſecuritie into the chanell of Tygris: and forthwith the armie upon bridges made of ſhips couched together being ſet over, tooke their journey toward Coche. And to the end that convenient reſt might follow upon ſuch weariſome travaile, wee ſat us downe in a rich territorie, moſt pleaſantly garniſhed with Hortyards, Vines, and greene Cypreſſe trees: in the middeſt whereof ſtandeth a ſhadie and delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble retiring place of pleaſure, ſhewing in every rowme of the houſe, after that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey faſhion, pictures repreſenting the king in many ſorts of hunting, killing Deere and wild beaſts: for there is nothing elſe among them either drawne in picture, or caſt in counterfeit, but ſundrie kinds of ſlaughter, and warres.</p>

And being now fully perſuaded, that the like proſperous ſucceſſes would ſhortly hereafter follow, hee made preparation of many ſacrifices to <hi>Mars</hi> the Revenger: and whereas ten moſt beautifull bulls were to this purpoſe brought in place, nine of them, before they were preſented to the altars, of themſelves fell downe dead in moſt heavie and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner; and the tenth, who brake his bonds and got away, was hardly brought backe againe, and being ſlaine, ſhewed ominous ſignes of ill lucke.

And ſo, after hee had debated in counſell with the principall captaines and officers of the armie, as touching the beſieging of Cteſiphon, concluded it was according to the adviſe and mind of ſome, who knew it was an adventurous and unreaſonable peece of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to take that enterpriſe in hand; for that both the citie by the verie ſcituation thereof inexpugnable, was defended, and alſo thought verily it was, that the king would be there out of hand with a dreadfull power: So the better opinion tooke place, the utilitie whereof, when he a moſt prudent prince had approoved, hee ſent <hi>Arintheus</hi> with a power of light appointed footmen to forray and ſpoyle the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries lying round about, which were rich in cattell and corne, who with like indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie was to purſue the enemies alſo, that being lately put to rout and diſperſed, lay hidden in thicke over-growne wayes and holes, wherewith they were ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.

But all this while the Emperours ſouldiors both ſorrowed hereat, for that they neither had meanes to frame bridges, having ſo raſhly loſt their ſhips, nor could encounter the forces of ſtrange enemies, new come in, who were alreadie in place, as it appeared by the glittering brightneſſe of their armor, artificially wrought to bend with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie limme.

But ſo ſoone as it was faire daylight, the glittering habergeons trimmed all about with white guards, the bright curets made of yron plates, diſcovered a farre off, ſhewed the kings power to be at hand. At the ſight whereof, when the ſouldiors enkindled with courage, made haſt to encounter them, by reaſon of a little river that ſevered them aſunder, the Emperour forbad them: and not farre from the very rampier there was a cruell fight betweene our fore-riders and thoſe of the Perſians, wherein <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chameus,</hi> a leader of one regiment of ours, was ſlaine; in whoſe quarrell and defence his brother <hi>Maurus,</hi> Marqueſſe afterward of Phaenice, killed him who wounded his brother to death, terrifying every one that came in his way; him ſelfe alſo ſore hurt in the ſhoulder with a dart, was yet able with maine force to reſcue and draw forth of the battaile <hi>Machameus,</hi> looking wan and pale at the point of death. And when on both ſides they waxed faint with intollerable heat of the weather, and ſo many conflicts that they had ſuſtained, in the end the troupes of the enemies were with a foule repulſe broken and ſcattered. As we retyred ſomewhat farre from hence, the Saracenes for feare of our footmen conſtrained to returne backe, within a while after, intermingled with a multitude of the Perſians, ſuddainely charged, with a full mind to carrie away the Romane carriages: but ſo ſoone as they eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Emperour, they returned to the wings that lay in ſupplie. After wee were gone out of this region, we came to a village named Hucumbra; where for two dayes ſpace being refreſhed beſide our hope with all things meet for our uſe, and having gotten corne ynough, we departed: and preſently all the reſt, ſave only that which the time would give us leave to convey away, was conſumed with fire. The next day after, as our armie marched eaſily forward, the Perſians having at unwares ſet upon thoſe that were hindmoſt, who by chaunce that day had the charge of the

rereward, had with little adoe killed them every one, but that our Cavallerie that was neere at hand having intelligence hereof, being ſpred over the open and wide valeyes, repelled this great danger, by wounding thoſe that thus ſurpriſed them. In this skirmiſh was ſlaine <hi>Adaces,</hi> a noble peere of the kingdome, who had beene ſometime ſent in embaſſage to the Emperour <hi>Constantine,</hi> and courteouſly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; the killer of whom offering unto <hi>Iulianus</hi> his ſpoyles, was rewarded, as it well beſeemed. The ſame day a cornet of the <hi rend="sup">a</hi> Terciaci horſemen was much blamed and accuſed by the legions, for that when theſe brake into the enemies battaile, raunged full againſt them, they by little and little ſlipping away, had like to have diſcouraged the whole armie. Whereupon the Emperour growing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, as good reaſon he had, tooke from them their guidons, brake their laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and as many of them as were by juſt proofe knowne to have fled, he enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to march among the carriages, packes, truſſes, and captives: but their leader, who onely had fought manfully, was made captaine over another troupe, whoſe Tribune was convicted to have ſhamefully forſaken the field and fled. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, there were caſſed alſo and diſcharged of their militarie oath other Tribunes of certaine companies of horſemen, for the like foule and cowardly part: For, with this mild and moderate allay and temper of correction, conſidering the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and dangers toward, was the Emperour contented. When as therefore they had journeyed forward ſeventie <hi rend="sup">b</hi> ſtadia, by occaſion that there grew ſcarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all things, for that both graſſe and corne was burnt, every man was faine to catch out of the very flaming fire, and keepe for himſelfe what corne and forage hee was able to carrie.

Now were all their bands and regiments harneiſed in armor of yron, having every part of their bodie covered ſo cloſe and thick with plates, that the ſtiffe joints thereof were meet for the knitting of their lims: and vizards of mens faces were ſo curiouſly fitted to their heads, that whereas their bodies all over were plated, the ſhot lighting upon them, could there onely take hold and ſticke, where were little holes full againſt the eyes to admit a ſmall ſight, or where at the very tips of their noſes the narrow paſſages ſerved for their wind and breath: of theſe, ſome readie to ſerve with pikes, ſtood firme &amp; kept their ground ſo, as a man would have thought they had bin fixed faſt, and held with chaines and ropes of braſſe: hard by them were marſhalled the archers, in which feat the whole nation from their very cradle hath bin paſſing confident of their skill, and mightie in the practiſe thereof: and theſe drew their bent bowes with their armes ſo wide aſunder, that the ſtrings came cloſe to their right breaſt heads, and the arrow heads lay juſt upon their left hands, and with exceeding skill in the ſtroke of their fingers, the ſhafts flew out with a whiſtling and ſinging ſound, carrying with them miſchievous and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounds. After them were placed the Elephants, the terrible ſight of which beaſts all glittering together, with their grim and cruell yawning of their mouthes, fearefull minded men could hardly endure: upon whom ſat their maſters, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying faſt tied unto their right armes knives with hafts, as bearing in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance ſtill the defeature and loſſe they received at Niſibis: and if the unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beaſt could not be reſtrained by the ſtrength of his maſter, for feare leaſt

turning backe upon their owne men (as it fell out then) hee might overthrow the common ſouldiors, with a mightie ſtroke they made a gaſh into that turning joint that parteth the head and necke aſunder. For the experiment was once made by <hi>Aſdruball</hi> the brother of <hi>Anniball,</hi> that this was the readie way to diſpatch ſuch beaſts, and bereave them of their life. Which being ſeene not without great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, the moſt confident and reſolute Emperour, guarded round about with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Cohorts, and the principall captaines, according as this extraordinarie puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance and cruell forces required, arraunged thoſe bands which were to affront and encounter the enemie, in forme of a <note n="*" place="margin">or halfe moone.</note> Creſcent, with bowing and winding ſides. And leaſt Archers running foorth might diſray the rankes and companies of our men, he advaunced forward the banners more ſpeedily, and thereby brake the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent force of their ſhot: and after the uſuall manner, after he had given the ſignall of battaile, the Romane footmen ſtanding thicke together, with preaſſing hard, thruſt backe the thronged fronts of the enemies vaward: and as the medley grew hote, ſuch a ſound there was of ſhields, ſuch a clattering noyſe alſo, as well of the men themſelves as their weapons, making a dolefull din, as among whome there was now no hoe nor ſtay at all of their hands, that all the fields were covered over with bloud and ſlaine bodies lying along: But the Perſians were they that fell fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the ground: who being oftentimes faint in conflict, found a great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and inconvenience in this cloſe fight foot to foot, as wonted otherwiſe to beare themſelves valiantly afarre off; and if they perceive at any time their battai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons to give ground and recule, by retyring toward the backe of them, in manner of ſhowers and ſtormes to ſhoot their arrowes ſtreight, and ſo to fright their enemies from any bold and confident purſuit. The Parthians therefore being driven backe and borne downe by maine force, our ſouldiors out-toyled a long time, and ſwelte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the flaming heat of the Sun, after the ſound given of retreat, returne againe to their tents, emboldened by this good hand, thenceforth to attempt greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits. In this battaile it was evident (as I ſayd before) that the ſlaughter of the Perſians was very great, and of our men as ſmall. But among the variable chaunces that fell out in theſe conflicts, remarkable above the reſt was the death of <hi>Veteranio,</hi> a brave warrior, who commaunded the legion of the <hi rend="sup">c</hi> Zianni.</p>

Thus verily whiles we firmely guard our ſides, and the armie according to the ſite and poſition of the ground, marcheth in ſix ſquare battailons diſplayed at large with thin rankes, word was brought unto the prince, being as yet unarmed, and gone forth forward to diſcover the quarters before, That ſodainly thoſe who behind were gathering up their armour and weapons together, had a charge given them at their backes. At which accident he was much troubled, and catching up haſtily in this tumult his ſhield, but forgetting his corſlet, and making haſt to helpe thoſe in the rereward, was called backe againe with another new alarme, whereby adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed he was, that the avant-guard alſo, from whence he was lately departed, felt the like diſtreſſe.

When the Prince was brought againe into his pavili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a man would not beleeve in what heat the ſouldiors enchaufed with anger and griefe haſtened to revenge, rapping their ſhields with their ſpeares, fully bent even to dye for it, if the caſe ſo required.

And his temperance in this kind, was much helped and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by this exceeding ſpare dyet, and ſhort ſleepe, which he tooke unto, and uſed both at home and abroad. For, in time of peace his ſlender fare at the table, to as many as can judge aright, was admirable; as if he had meant ſhortly to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:14644:137"/>
to his booke in the Vniverſitie. And during the time of divers and ſundrie warre-ſervices, hee was ſeene ſometimes after the manner of an ordinarie ſouldior to take a ſhort &amp; homely pittance ſtanding. Alſo, when he had refreſhed his bodie, hardened by toileſome labour, with a ſmall repoſe of ſleepe, when he awakened, he would alone by himſelfe walke the round, looke to the ſentinels, and ſee how they watched and warded by turnes, betaking himſelf after theſe ſerious exerciſes to the deepe ſtudies of learning. And if his lights that burned in the night, by which hee ſtudied, could poſſibly ſpeake, they would verily ſhew and teſtifie, that there was great difference betweene him and ſome princes, conſidering they knew, that he tooke not his pleaſure and ſolace ſo much, as to content the neceſſities of nature. Then, concerning his prudence and wiſdome, therewere very many ſignes and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, of which it ſhall ſuffice to reckon a few. Moſt skilfull he was in feats of armes, and in the civile profeſſion of gowned arts paſſing ſtudious, aſcribing and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo much onely to himſelfe as he thought was betwixt contempt and pride: el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in vertue than in yeares; ſtudious to gaine all kinds of knowledge: Sometimes an inflexible and conſtant Iudge; in reforming of manners a moſt quick and ſevere Cenſor; a meeke contemner of riches, and a deſpiſer of all worldly things. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, this was an Apothegme of his, <hi>That it was a ſhame for a wiſe man having a ſoule to ſeeke for praiſe and commendation from the bodie.</hi> Now what good and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable parts he had of juſtice, many particulars doe ſhew: firſt, that he was in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective diſtinction of all matters, terrible, but not cruell: then, in that with the perill of ſome few he reſtrained vices: and more againe, becauſe he rather ſhooke the ſword, than ſtrucke with it. Laſt of all, to paſſe over many examples, certaine it is, that againſt ſome open enemies of his and ſuch as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The ſervice of the bodie is required properly of a ſouldior, and the deed of the mind of a Generall and Commaunder. As for him, in his owne perſon hee would boldly encounter hand to hand a ſterne and cruell enemie, and him at one blow kill outright: and divers times himſelfe alone would by oppoſing his owne breaſt reſtraine and hold in our ſouldiors, when they were at the point to give backe and recule. Alſo, whiles he conquered and ſubdued the kingdomes of the furious Germans, and converſed in the ſmoothering and ſultrie hot duſt of Perſia, by fighting perſonally among the formoſt in the vaward, he encouraged and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened our men. The skill that he had in militarie and campe-affaires, many things, and thoſe well knowne, doe declare; his aſſaults of cities and caſtles, the many formes of embattailing and ſetting his forces in array at the very point of dangers and extremities, the pitching of his tents for holeſomeneſſe and ſafetie, his fore-fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>corps de guard,</hi> and frontier ſtations without in the fields, ordered wholly with good reaſons and conſiderations. As for the countenance and authoritie that hee carried, it was ſo great, that being moſt entirely loved, yet was he dread withall: and howſoever he ſeemed a fellow in perils and painefull toyles, yet in the hoteſt conflicts he could commaund idle cowards to be puniſhed; and being as yet but <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he could without pay rule his ſouldiors even when they were oppoſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſavage nations, as hath beene ſaid erewhile: and making a ſpeech on a time to his ſouldiors all armed, when they ſnuffled and became unruly, he threatened, That he would betake himſelfe to a private life againe, unleſſe they left their muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:14644:137"/>
To be ſhort, this one proofe of his authoritie, inſteed of many, it ſhall be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to know, That upon an exho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To ſpeake of his felicitie, ſo conſpicuous and notable it was, that being carried after a ſort upon the very ſhoulders, as it were, of fortune, who continued a pretie while a good Pilot and directreſſe unto him, with traines of victorious courſes he overcame infinit difficulties. And after that he was gone out of the Weſt climate, ſo long as he lived upon the earth, al nations reſted in quietneſſe and peace, as if a certain <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi> of this world had with his rod enchanted and appeaſed them. Laſt of all, of his liberalitie there be many and thoſe moſt true teſtimonies, among which theſe may goe. Very light and eaſie tributes were by him levied, the taxe or impoſition of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronets was pardoned, many debts growne great by continuance of time, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and forgiven, the ſuits about the princes revenues &amp; thoſe of private perſons were indifferently heard, cuſtomes and tols were reſtored unto cities together with their lands, all but thoſe which the governours in the foregoing times had alienated (as it were) lawfully by ſale.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe matters thus wrought by a certaine blind judgement of Fortune, the enſigne-bearer of the <hi rend="sup">n</hi> Ioviani, whom <hi>Varronianus</hi> had conducted, being at variance of late with this new elected Emperour, then a privat perſon, as who was an intemperat traducer and backbiter of his father, fearing danger toward from an enemie ſtepped now above the degree of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort, revolted to the Perſians, and having audience granted unto him to ſpeake what he knew, advertiſeth <hi>Sapor,</hi> who now approached, That upon the death of him whom he feared, <hi>Iovianus</hi> no better than a <hi rend="sup">o</hi> Protector, an unskilfull perſon and an effeminat, was in a tumultuous ſtir of drudges and campe ſlaves, taken to beare the name and ſhadow of an Emperour. When he heard this (which alwayes in his timorous prayers he wiſhed for and deſired) being ſet aloft with this unlooked for proſperitie, joining a number out of the roial cavallery, unto thoſe who had fought with us, he determined with a ſpeedie marching pace to have the taile of our armie charged. And in the end, whiles beaſts for ſacrifice were ordained to and fro in the behalfe of <hi>Iovianus,</hi> upon inſpection of their bowels pronounced it was, That if he ſtaied within the campe (as he thought to do) he ſhould looſe all, but if hee went forth he ſhould have the upper hand. And therefore as wee began to go forth, the Perſians with their Elephants leading the way, gave the onſet upon us. At the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible braying and fearefull approach of which beaſts, after that both horſe and man at the firſt were much troubled and diſordered, the Ioviani and <hi rend="sup">p</hi> Herculani, when they had killed ſome few of the ſaid Elephants, manfully reſiſted the horſemen ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at all peeces. Then the legions of the Iovij and <hi rend="sup">q</hi> Victores, in helping their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that were diſtreſſed, ſlew two Elephants, with no ſmall number of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And in the left wing of the battaile, three right valiant warriors loſt their lives, namely, <hi>Iulianus, Macrobius,</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> Tribunes or Colonels of thoſe legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which then were the principall of the whole armie. After whoſe funerals ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized, as the preſent neceſſitie would permit, neere unto the ſhutting in of the evening, whiles we were marching apace to a fortreſſe named Sumere, the bodie of <hi>Anatolius</hi> there lying, was knowne, which in haſtie and tumultuarie wiſe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the earth. Here alſo we recovered threeſcore of our ſouldiors, together with the <hi rend="sup">r</hi> Palatines, who, as we related before, were fled into a fort named Vacca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. Then the day following, according as the place wold permit, we encamped in an even valley, encloſed round about, within the circuit, as it were, of a wall (all ſave one place to goe forth at, and the ſame lying open) with ſharpe ſtakes pitched on every ſide, and ſtanding out in maner of ſo many ſword points. And when the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſaw this, out of the woods and foreſts, they let flie at us ſundrie ſorts of dartes and caſting weapons, reviling us alſo in reproachfull tearmes, as perfidious traitors, and murderers of a moſt valorous and excellent Prince: for they had heard (as the very fugitives reported) by occaſion of an headleſſe rumor that ran abroad, how <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> was ſlain by the hand and weapon of a Roman. In the end alſo certaine cornets of horſemen having broken through the <hi rend="sup">ſ</hi> gate Praetoria, were ſo bold herewith,

as to come neere unto the verie Princes pavilion: but after many of their own ſide ſlaine, were repulſed with maine force. Being gone from thence, the next night af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we entred upon Charcha, a place in this regard ſafe, for that by reaſon of the high banks of the rivage being by mans hand raiſed, to the end, that the Saracens might not from thenceforth over-runne Aſſyria, there was not one as before time that trobled our ſquadrons in their march.

                  <hi>Caeſar</hi> together with his principall counſellors, and great men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him performed ſuch poynts as hee commaunded. To countermatch theſe, was <hi>Arintheus</hi> together with <hi>Salustius</hi> the Praefect ſent: but whiles there was ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in conſultation with ſage adviſement, what was to be done, foure dayes went over our heads, the which tormented and plagued us with hunger, and were unto us more grievous than any puniſhment whatſoever. Which reſpite of time, before theſe were ſent, if the Prince had made his uſe of, and by little and little departed out of the enemies ground, certes he had reached to the ſtrong garriſon townes of Corduena, a countrey both plentifull and our owne, and beſides, not above one hundred miles diſtant from the place wherein theſe affaires were treated of. Now, the king claimed hard and required to have his owne (as himſelfe ſaid) which long ſince <hi>Maximian</hi> had taken from him: but as it appeared in the handling, hee required for our ranſome (as it were) and redemption, five countries beyond. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris, to wit, Arzanena, Moxoena, and Zabdicena; likewiſe Rhehimena and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duena, with fifteene caſtles: alſo Niſibis, Singara, and Caſtra Maurorum, a ſtrong hold of verie good importance. And whereas it had beene better to have fought ten fields, than that any one of theſe ſhould be ſurrendred, yet the crew of flatterers came about the timorous Prince, buzzing and whiſpering in his eares the dread name of <hi>Procopius,</hi> who unleſſe he made the more ſpeedie returne, taking know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Iulians</hi> death, would eaſily with the power of thoſe unfoyled ſouldiors whom he had in his regiment, worke an alteration in the State, and proclaime him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe Emperour, whiles there was none to make head againſt him. With theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious words iterated continually unto him, he grew enkindled, and without any farther hafting or holding off, delivered up all that was demaunded: after that with great ado he obtained thus much, That Niſibis and Singara, without the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants therein, ſhould paſſe under the dominion of the Perſians: alſo, that from the forts or holds which were to be alienated, the garriſons that were verie Romans ſhould be ſuffered to revert into our hands. To theſe capitulations was added ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther article alſo moſt miſchievous &amp; impious, namely, That after this compoſition paſſed, <hi>Arſaces,</hi> a friend unto us at all times, and a truſtie confederat, we might not aid, if he craved it againſt the Perſians. Which was deviſed for a twofold reaſon; partly, that the man might be puniſhed, who at the Princes commaundement had waſted Chiliocomus; and partly, that there might remaine ſtill ſome occaſion of quarell, under colour whereof they might from time to time invade Armenia at their pleaſure. Whereby it happened afterward, that the ſame <hi>Arſaces</hi> was taken priſoner alive, and the Parthians among theſe diſſentions and troublous garboyles, went away with the greateſt ſide of Armenia, confining upon the Medes, together with <note n="*" place="margin">a citie.

Thus after a peace for thirtie yeares was concluded, and the ſame ſurely ratified by the ſolemne complements of a religious othe, we returned another way, &amp; becauſe we avoided the places adjoining to the river, as comberous &amp; rough, diſtreſſed we were for want of drinke and meat both.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:14644:141"/>
And ſo this peace graunted under colour of courteſie &amp; humanitie, turned to the deſtruction of many; who being pinched with extreame hunger to their very laſt gaſpe, and therefore ſecretly going before, were either for want of skill in ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſwallowed up of the rivers ſtreame; or els, if they paſſed and overcame the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of the waves and came to the bankes, by the Saracenes or Perſians (whom, as I ſaid, the Germans had expelled a little before) killed like ſheepe, or ſent farre off to be ſold as ſlaves. But when as the trumpets ſounding together, openly gave ſignall of paſſing over the river, a wonder it was to ſee with what a heat every man raſhly venturing upon all advantages of triall, &amp; putting himſelfe before all the reſt, made haſt to ſhun many fearefull dangers: whiles ſome ſitting upon hurdles, made at all adventures, holding their horſes as they ſwum on either hand; others upon bottles; and ſome again turning and winding divers waies in the point of neceſſitie, with crooked courſes cut and pierced through the billowes and waves beating full againſt them. The Emperour himſelfe with ſome few others, having croſſed over in thoſe ſmall barkes which remained after the burning of the fleet, as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, appointed the ſame veſſels to paſſe to and fro betweene, untill we were all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed over. And in the end we came to the bankes on the further ſide (all ſave thoſe that were drowned) through the gracious favor of the heavenly power, having by hard chaunces eſcaped out of jeopardie. Whiles we ſtood yet in feare of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and troubles hanging over our heads, given we were to underſtand by there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which our fore-riders made, That the Perſians were making of a bridge farre out of our ſight, to the end, that now after peace and covenants eſtabliſhed, whiles the tempeſtuous ſtormes of warre were allayed, they might ſet upon our ſickly and craſie folke as they went ſecure and feareleſſe, as alſo our beaſts, long wearied and tyred out of heart.

For ſo grievous and extreame was the famine whereby wee pined, that if in any place there was but one <hi rend="sup">x</hi> Modius or peck of meale found (and that happened but ſeldome) it was exchanged for ten pieces of gold.

After this, the prince having made haſt in his journey, and gladly ſeene Niſibis, pitched his ſtanding campe without the citie: and being earneſtly requeſted by many prayers of the people, that hee would enter the citie, and as the cuſtome was of other princes, lodge within the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, he ſtiffely refuſed, as being abaſhed and aſhamed, that whiles he converſed within the wals, the citie, otherwiſe in expugnable, ſhould be delivered up into the angrie enemies hands.

The next day <hi>Bineſes,</hi> one of the Perſians, who (as I ſaid) was a noble and right honorable perſon among others, making haſt to accompliſh his lord and kings commandement, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led inſtantly for the performance of promiſe and by permiſſion of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour entred the citie, ſet up the banner of his owne nation upon the citadell, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing unto the citizens their lamentable remove and departure out of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſeat. And being preſently commaunded all to flit and be gone, they ſtretched forth their hands, and beſought there might be impoſed upon them no neceſſitie of departing, ſaying, That they alone, without the publicke allowance of victuals and ſouldiors, were able to defend their dwelling houſes, truſting aſſuredly, as they had oftentimes found by experience, to find juſtice hereafter alſo fighting for the place wherein they were borne. And in this wiſe verily the States and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons humbly prayed: but they ſpake in vaine to the very winds, as they ſay; whiles the Emperour made ſemblance (fearing indeed other things) that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined

Then <hi>Sabinus,</hi> a man forwealth and birth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed among his fellow citizens and burgeſles, having a rolling tongue of his owne, made a ſpeech to this effect: <hi>That</hi> Conſtantius <hi>in a world of fierce and cruell warres, was otherwhiles vanquiſhed of the Perſians, and brought in the end by flight with ſome few, to Hibita, no ſure nor fenced station, where he lived with a piece of bread which an old woman of the countrey at his much entreatie reached unto him; yet for all this, lost he none of his Seignories to his dying day: and</hi> Iovian <hi>now at his first entrance into his Empire hath parted from the very wall of the Provinces, by the barre, as one would ſay, whereof they continued time out of mind, without taking any harme.</hi> But when as hee could not prevaile, whiles the prince conſtantly pretended the conſcience of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the oath he tooke: and when as he received at length with much adoe and by conſtraint a Coronet preſented unto him, which he a good while refuſed, one <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanus</hi> an advocate, that uſed to plead in the defence of mens cauſes, crying boldly alowd: <hi>So crowned</hi> (quoth he) <hi>ô Emperour, mayeſt thou be by all other cities b-ſides.</hi> At which word hee grew ſo angrie, that hee commaunded them all within three dayes to depart out of the wals, deteſting and curſing the preſent ſtate of the time.

ſome have many times aſpired to high matters, he making haſt to prevent the fame of his comming, under a pretenſe of avoyding perjurie, committed an act unbeſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming an Emperour, by looſing Niſibis, which ever ſince king <hi>Mithridates</hi> his dayes ſtood out with might and maine, that the Eaſt Empire ſhould not come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the poſſeſſion of the Perſians. For, never ſince the citie of Rome was firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, can we find, as I ſuppoſe, though you read over all the Annales, that either Conſul or Emperour gave away the right of any part of our territories, or that triumphall honours were ever conferred upon any for the recoverie of aught that had beene taken away, but for the enlarging of our dominions. Hence it was that unto <hi>Publius Scipio,</hi> for the regaining of Spaine, unto <hi>Fulvius,</hi> when Capua, after skirmiſhes and aſſaults made a long time, was won, and unto <hi>Opimius</hi> after divers battailes ended, what time as the Fregellanes then mortall enemies, were forced to yeeld themſelves, triumphes were denied. Thus much alſo we learned out of the auncient records, That in extreame caſes covenants made with a generall and chief leader, after that the parties on both ſides tooke an expreſſe and formall othe, were ſtreightwayes by making warie afreſh undone and voyd: as for example, in old time at the ſtreits or gullet Caudinae, when the Roman legions were in Samnium put to the yoke: alſo, when by <hi>Albinus</hi> in Numidia a peace was wickedly thought and treated of: and laſtly, when <hi>Mancinus</hi> the author of an agreement made diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourably in haſt, was delivered up unto the Numantines. Well, after this, when the citizens were fetched forth, &amp; the citie rendred, and <hi>Constantius</hi> a Tribune ſent to aſſigne &amp; ſet out the garriſon forts with their territories, unto the Perſian Lords and great Captaines, <hi>Procopius</hi> was ſent with the reliques of <hi>Iulian,</hi> to interre the ſame in the ſuburbs of Tarſus, as he had given charge in his life time. Who taking his journey to execute this buſineſſe, preſently after he had buried the bodie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted: neither could he be found any where, although with great diligence hee was ſought for, untill that long after he was ſeene at Conſtantinople all on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine inveſted in his purple robes. Theſe matters in this wiſe brought about, and our journeyes thus diſpatched, we came to Antioch, where, for many dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as if God had beene offended) were ſeene many fearefull and ſtrange ſights, the events whereof, ſuch as were skilfull in prodigial learning foretold and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, would be wofull and lamentable. For, both the ſtatue of <hi>Maximian Caeſar,</hi> which ſtood in the verie porch or entrie of the kings houſe, loſt ſodainly the braſen ball, faſhioned to the forme of the <note n="*" place="margin">or heavenly globe</note> Pole which he carried: and alſo with an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble noyſe the beames and poſts within the Conſiſtories made a ſound. There were ſeene likewiſe in the day-time blazing ſtarres: as touching the nature whereof the Naturall Philoſophers varie much in their reaſons and arguments. For ſome hold, That therefore they be called Comets or hairie ſtarres, for that when a multitude of ſtarres be gathered together, by the flaſhing of fire from them, certaine haires ſeeme to be ſcattered. Others are of opinion, That of a drie exhalation of the earth ſteeming up aloft by little and little they catch fire. Some againe doe thinke, That the rayes or beames of the Sunne, being kept from going downeward by the oppoſition of a thicke cloud betweene, and caſting a brightneſſe upon a groſſe bodie, repreſent unto mans eye a light, diſtinguiſhed, as it were with ſtarres.

And anon being inveſted in regall robes, crowned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo and ſtyled <hi>[Auguſtus]</hi> with ample praiſes, ſuch as ſweet noveltie could deviſe, he addreſſed himſelfe to make a premeditate ſpeech, and as he put forth his arme, that he might ſpeake more readily, there aroſe a great mumbling, with a noyſe of the Centuries, Maniples, and all the Cohorts, urging inſtantly, that out of hand there might a ſecond Emperour bee declared with him. Which albeit many thought was done by the corruption of ſome few, in favour of thoſe that had been rejected, yet by this one thing it ſeemed they were utterly deceived, becauſe the crie went not as voices purchaſed with money, but like an uniforme accord of the whole multitude wiſhing and willing one thing; as fearing much by the freſh example

they had of late, the frailtie and brittleneſſe of high fortunes. Then from ſecret whiſperings it appeared evidently, that there was a more violent tumult rayſed of the armie, making a mightie noiſe; and doubted it was, what the ſoldiors confident boldneſſe might prove, which otherwhiles breaketh out into miſchievous actions. Which <hi>Valentinian</hi> fearing more than all others, leaſt it ſhould come to paſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, holding happily up his right hand as a moſt hardie and redoubted prince, daring to rebuke ſome of them as ſeditious and ſtubborne, delivered his mind without interruption of any in this manner. <hi>Moſt valiant defendors of the provinces, I reioyce and acknowledge now, and ever ſhall, that your vertues have conferred upon me, as the worthieſt of all others, the rule of the Romane world, without any hope or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire at all of mine. That therefore which lay in your power to doe, when there was not yet any Governour of the Empire elected, yee have profitably and with glorie performed, in taking him to the highest pitch of honour, whom from the prime of his youth, even to this ripeneſſe of yeares, yee knew by experience to have lived in much honour and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Wherefore listen (I pray you) with quiet and peaceable eares, what after mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in plaine and ſimple words delivered, is expedient for the Common-weale. That there ought against all chaunces whatſoever a colleague to be ioyned in fellowſhip of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, ſundrie conſiderations ſo requiring, I neither make doubt nor gaineſay, as who even my ſelfe alſo, being a man, feare heapes of cares and ſundrie changes of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. But we muſt with our whole power endevour to have peace, by which even the least things become mightie: and that will eaſily bee obtained, if your patience, ioyned with equitie, ſhall willingly yeeld that unto me which belongeth unto my charge. For, as I hope, Fortune (the adiutrice of good purpoſes) will give the ſame unto me, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king diligently (ſo much as I am able to effect and attaine unto) after a temperature and moderation. For, as wiſe and learned men define this point, not onely in the matter of an Empire, where the greatest dangers are, and thoſe happening most often, but alſo in private and dayly affaires, when any wiſe man hath iudged a ſtranger meet for his friendſhip, he ought then to take him, and not when he hath taken him, then to iudge of him.

For, <hi>Rumitalca</hi> a Tribune, being taken into the ſocietie of the Procopians, and having entred upon the charge of the Palace, and therewith complotted in good time this deſigne, and communicated it with the ſouldiors, came by water to a towne before time named <note n="*" place="margin">Ponto Sabia, and Trapani, <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motio.</hi>

But by reaſon that the companies of the beſiegers were oftentimes ſore troubled with arrows, bullets, &amp; other ſhot, as alſo for that through the induſtrie of the defendants there was deviſed a barre, by a verie ſtrong yron chaine beſtowed in the verie mouth of the haven (which, becauſe the enemies ſhips armed with piked-beake-heads, might not ruſh in, was bound faſt at either end) long it was ere the ſiege tooke effect. This chaine, after ſundrie paines that both ſouldiors and captaines tooke (who alreadie were out-toiled with moſt ſharp conflicts) one <hi>Aliſo,</hi> a Tribune, and an expert warrior, cut away by this device. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three ſhips joyned together, he built a roofe over head in this manner: Vpon the formoſt hatches or rowers bankes ſtood armed men cloſe together with their ſhields couched thick over their heads, others alſo behind them ſtooping ſomwhat lower, &amp; a third ſort by degrees bending their bodies down: ſo as the hindmoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting upon their houghes or hammes, made a ſhew of an arched building: Which kind of Fabricke againſt fight from walls, is framed in ſuch a forme for this cauſe, That the ſhot of caſting weapons and of ſtones, as they light and fall, might glance and glide off like ſhewers of raine, and ſo take no effect. Thus therefore <hi>Aliſo</hi> being ſaved for a while from the violence of dartes and other ſhot, with mightie ſtrength of bodie putting underneath a ſound pyle or poſt, with the huge ſtroke of an axe ſo clave and burſt the chaine aforeſaid, that it fell aſunder, and gave a large en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to the citie. And ſo by the working of this feat the citie lay open and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, to the violence of the enemies. For which cauſe what time as afterwards <hi>(Procopius)</hi> the author of all this proud and audacious rebellion, was put to death, and the adherents and complices of this faction cruelly executed, this verie Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune in regard of ſo noble an exployt, keeping his life ſtill, and the place he had in warre-ſervice, dyed long after in Iſauria, ſtabbed and killed by a ſort of robbing Brigands.

Like as upon a time the Macedonians, readie to ſtrike a battail with the Illyrians, placed their king (as yet an infant in his ſwathling bands) behind the armie raunged in battaile ray; for feare of whom, leaſt he ſhould be carried away captive, they fought more vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, and vanquiſhed their enemies.

Which being knowne, <hi>Gomoarius,</hi> when he might well ynough have deluded the enemies, and returned ſafe to the place from whence he came, taking the vauntage of the neere diſtance, in pretence and colour of a captive paſſed over to the Emperours campe, as if he had beene beſet with the rode of a multitude, that he ſuddainely eſpied.

But whiles he a long while trifled out the time, and alledged, That himſelfe was not able to ſet upon the barbarous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſo ſcattered and ſpred in ſundrie parts, and was ſoone after ſent for to take upon him the dignitie of a Conſull together with <hi>Gratian,</hi> who as yet was but a privat perſon, <hi>Iovinus</hi> Generall of the Cavallarie addreſſed himſelfe to this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and being well appointed and readie in battaile ray, having a moſt watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and warie eye to both the ſides of his armie as it marched, drew neere unto a place named <note n="*" place="margin">Scarpaigue, <hi>Ortel.</hi>
                  </note> Scarpona: where ſodainely and unlooked for, he ſurpriſed the greater multitude of the ſayd Barbarians, before they were armed, and in the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of an hand flew them everie one. This worthy and notable captaine leading forth his ſouldiors (rejoycing for this glorious battaile, which coſt them no loſſe of bloud) for to defeat likewiſe the other companie behind, and marching ſoftly on, was enformed by a truſtie eſpial, That the forces of theſe ſpoyling brigands ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rifled the villages neere at hand, reſted hard by a river: and approaching then anone, and lying cloſe hidden in a darke vale ſet thick with groves and woods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held how ſome of them were waſhing and bathing themſelves, others buſie in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring the hayre of their heads yellow, and making the ſame ſhine like gold, (as their manner is) and ſome againe drinking garaus. Thus having met with a verie ſeaſonable time of advantage, all on a ſodaine he gave the ſignal by ſound of trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and brake into the campe of theſe robbers. The <note n="*" place="margin">or Dutch.</note> Germans on the contrarie ſide, in bragging wiſe rapping out nothing but vaine ſounds and noyſes of threats, were not permitted (the conquerour preſſed ſo hard upon them) either to make readie their armes and weapons ſcattered here and there, or to put themſelves in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of battaile, nor ſo much as to plucke up their ſpirits and reſume ſtrrength. A number therefore of them pierced through with javelins and ſwords, were ſlaine, beſides thoſe who ran away, and with good footmanſhip gat into the crooked and narrow lanes, and there hid themſelves. <hi>Iovinus</hi> now fleſhed and more embolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with this happie exployt, which vertue and fortune together had atchieved, leading on his ſouldiors, and ſending out before a diligent ſcout-watch to diſcover
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:14644:156"/>
the coaſts, made haſt with a running campe to charge upon the third regiment of them which remained. And having ſped himſelfe apace in this journey, he found them all neere to the <note n="*" place="margin">About Chalous in Champaigne.</note> Catelauni moſt readie to joyne battaile. When as therefore he had encamped himſelfe within a rampier in a place convenient, and as the time would give leave refreſhed his men with meat and ſleepe, at the verie dawning of the day he arraunged his armie diſplayed at large with politique skill in an open plaine, to the end that the Romans, inferiour in number, yet equall in puiſſance, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up ſo large a ground, might ſeeme to match the enemies in multitude. When as therefore the trumpets had ſounded the battaile, ſo that they began to fight cloſe hand to hand, the Germans affrighted with the ſtrange ſight of our glittering ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſtood ſtill. Who being for a while daunted, but ſoone after taking heart again, ſo that the conflict held unto the end of the day, our men with great force preſſing hard upon them, had gained the honour of a brave day, without any loſſe at all, but that <hi>Balcobaudes</hi> Tribune of the <hi rend="sup">b</hi> Armaturae, a man made altogether of big words, but cowardly withall, when as now the evening came on, reculed in diſorder: whom if the reſt of the cohorts had followed and gone away, the matter would have growne ſo farre forth to an heavie iſſue, that there could not poſſibly one have remained alive to tell what had beene done. But our ſouldiors ſtanding to it with reſolute and fierce courage, quit themſelves ſo well with ſtrength of armes, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſore wounded foure thouſand of the enemies, they left other ſix thouſand dead in the place: but they themſelves loſt not of their fellows above two hundred, and two hundred likewiſe and no more were hurt. Thus therefore when by the nights comming the battaile was ended, and the wearied bodies of our men refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, our brave leader toward day-light having ſtretched forth his armie in forme of a foure ſquare battaile, and found that the barbarous enemies taking vantage of the darkeneſſe, were ſecretly ſlipped away and gone, ſecure of any ambuſhments, followed through the open champian grounds and eaſie plaine wayes, riding over them as they lay along halfe dead, who by reaſon that the ſharpe cold aire drew their wounds together, were killed with extremitie of paine. After this when hee had gone further in his returne finding no enemie, he learned that the king of thoſe regiments of the enemies, with ſome few taken by the <hi rend="sup">c</hi> Haſtarij (whom himſelfe had ſent out another way to ranſacke the tents of the Alemans) was hanged on a gibbet. Hereupon in his anger he purpoſed to puniſh the Tribune, that durſt doe ſuch a deed without the advice of an higher power; and verily had condemned him, but that it appeared by evident proofes, that this foule and cruel fact was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the ſouldiors hot bloud. After this, as he returned toward Paris, upon the exploiting of this brave ſervice, the Emperour with great joy met him, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards named and elected him Conſull: and this, I aſſure you, augmented the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his joy, For that the verie ſame time he had received the head of <hi>Procopius,</hi> ſent over to him from <hi>Valens.</hi> Beſides all this, there were many other skirmiſhes fought, leſſe worthy the relation, in ſundrie tracts of Gaule, which here to ſet down were ſuperfluous labour, conſidering that neither the proofe and iſſue thereof brought any great matter of gaine and importance, nor beſeeming it is to draw our an hyſtorie in length by ſuch baſe and ſlight particulars.</p>

After him followed in the regencie and government of the citie, <hi>Lampadius,</hi> who had bin Praefectus Praetorio: a man that would take the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter verie hainouſly, if he were not prayſed even when he did but ſpit, as who (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) had a ſpeciall grace above all others, to doe that alſo with wiſedome: but yet otherwhiles he was grave and of good government.

But to ſhew his vanitie (that we rove not much abroad) it ſhall ſuffice to put downe this one example, a ſmall matter though it be, yet ſuch as Iudges ought to take heed of. For, in everie part of the citie which had beene adorned at the expences of ſundrie princes, he would uſe to write his owne name, not as REPAIRER of old, but as FOVNDER of new workes: (Of which diſeaſe <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperour is ſaid to have laboured;

                  </note> friends ſpeedily ran and aſſembled themſelves, and from the houſe tops pelted them ſo with ſtones and tyles, that they were glad to depart.

<hi>Damaſus</hi> and <hi>Vrſicinus</hi> exceedingly hote ſet upon the getting of the Epiſcopall See, by diviſions and factions contended moſt bitterly, ſo that the partakers of both ſides proceeded as farre as to dealing of bloudie blowes, and even to danger of death.

Whiles theſe matters above ſaid proceed thus in Gaule and Italie, new warres aroſe in Thracia. For <hi>Valens,</hi> as it ſeemed good unto his brother, whoſe advice he asked, and after whoſe will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he was wholly ruled, levied armes againſt the Gothes, moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thereto upon a good and juſt cauſe; namely, for that they ſent aids to <hi>Procopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> when he entred into civile warres.

As for the deſcription of Thracia, eaſie it were, if the auncient writers thereupon did accord: but for as much as their obſcure varietie helpeth not a worke that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth truth, ſufficient it ſhall be briefely to tell, what I have to mine owne remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance ſeene. That theſe lands extended in times paſt a mightie way, as well in plaine and pleaſant champian fields, as alſo in high hils, the ever-during authoritie of <hi>Homer</hi> doth ſhew, who faineth, That the two winds <note n="*" place="margin">

And now bearing himſelfe aloft with great boldneſſe, when riding up and downe, he could find none that he might overcome or terrifie (for all men ſtrucken with feare of our ſouldiors, approching with a brave ſhew of preparation, were retyred to the mountaines of the <note n="*" place="margin">

Now, after ſundrie accidents that fell out in theſe three yeares ſpace, there were good motives and reaſons to end the warre. Firſt, for

Vnto whom, the Emperour unexpert, I muſt needs ſay, but a moſt equall and indifferent conſiderer as yet of things, before that he was beguiled with the pernitious allurements of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, and afflicted the Commonwealth with ſlaughters and executions for ever to be lamented, taking ſage advice for the common good, decreed, That it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovefull to graunt peace. And he ſent forth by turnes <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Arintheus,</hi> who then had the managing of the horſemens ſervice.

But whiles theſe matters are thought upon to no effect, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſomewhat refreſhed and recovered by the meanes of many remedies, and perceiving that himſelfe was ſcarce yet delivered from daunger of death, had a full purpoſe to adorne with the imperiall enſignes his owne ſonne <hi>Gratian,</hi> a pretie young ſtripling, and well growne: and having provided all things in readineſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and wrought the ſouldiors to accept thereof in good gree and willingly, when <hi>Gratian</hi> was come he went forth into the field, and aſcended up to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall: where being environed with a gallant companie of noble perſons and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of State, hee tooke the youth by the right hand, brought him forth before them, and with a ſolemne publicke oration recommended him (as ordained Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour) to the armie, in this wiſe: <hi>In this habit of princely place and dignitie which I carrie about with me as an ample ſigne of your favour enlarged toward me, by which I am deemed a more worthie perſonage than many others, and thoſe right honourable, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you my aſſociats in counſels, and fore-men in deſires and wiſhes, in due office of pietie and kindneſſe, ſet in hand with a matter, God ſaying Amen, and promiſing good ſucceſſe, by whoſe eternall ayd and helpe the Roman State ſhall ſtand firme and invincible. Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand therefore, I beſeech you, with peaceable minds, yee right valiant Knights, what our deſire is, conſidering thus much withall, that theſe things which the lawes of love and naturall affection ordaine to be done, we have beene deſirous not onely to paſſe with your knowledge and privitie, but alſo to have approoved and ratified, as meet and expedient for us, by your authoritie.

For, as I am woont to thinke and conceit of him, weighing many times, as I do, his manners and motions (though the ſame are not yet come to maturitie in theſe tender and youthfull yeares of his) for as much as being poliſhed with humanitie, and the ſtudies of wittie ſciences, he ſhall peiſe and examine by uncorrupt iudgement the deſerts for well and evill doing, hee will ſo order the matter, that good men ſhall underſtand there is knowledge taken and regard had of them: He will advance and put himſelfe forward to performe brave exploits, readie to ſtick cloſe unto the militarie enſignes and Aegles: he will endure the hot parching Sunne, the cold frost and ſnow, long thirst and watching: he will otherwhiles, if need ſo require, make good and defend the campe: he will venture and expoſe his owne life for his partners in perils; and, that which is the chiefe and principall point of pietie, he wilbe able to love the Commonwealth, as the verie houſe of his father and auncestors.</hi> Theſe words, before he had made an end of his ſpeech, being heard with joyfull aſſent, everie ſouldior ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his place haſtening and ſtriving a vie, with glad heart one to out-goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as if they had beene partakers of commoditie and joy, declared <hi>Gratian Augustus,</hi> intermingling with a moſt lowd ſound of trumpets, the gentle noyſe and clattering of their armour.

robes of higheſt eſtate, he kiſſed him: and thus all gorgeous and goodly to be ſeen, and giving attentive eare to that which he ſaid, he ſpake unto him in this manner: <hi>Behold</hi> (quoth he) <hi>my ſonne</hi> Gratian, <hi>thou hast upon thee Imperiall garments, as we all hoped for, conferred with luckie oſſes and acclamations by the iudgement of my ſelfe and our fellow ſouldiors: Arme thy ſelfe therefore according to the importance of ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent affaires, as the Colleague of thy father and uncle both, and enure thy bodie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare to goe over with the whole regiments of footmen, the rivers Hister and Rhene, paſſable on foot with yce; to ſtand next unto the armed ſouldiors; to ſpendthy bloud and life both conſideratly for them whom thou doestrule; yea and to thinke that no ſtraunge ground which reacheth to any ſide of the Roman Empire. Let it ſuffice for this preſent, to have given thus much in charge: for the rest, I ſhall not ceaſe to admoniſh thee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.

After this they fell all at once to reſound the prayſes of the elder Emperour and the yong Prince both, but eſpecially of the youth himſelfe, whom a lively, a quick lightſome eye, a moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant grace as well of countenance as the reſt of the bodie, beſides a ſingular toward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of wit and mind did commend: which had made an accompliſhed Emperor comparable with the beſt that ever were in auncient times, if the Deſtinies would have given leave, and his inward favourites beſides, who with their leawd and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked acts darkened his vertue, which as yet was well ſetled.

Theſe brigands exceeding prowd and bold for this good ſucceſſe, and raunging more confidently ſundrie wayes, the maine armie at length went forth, and after ſome few of them ſlaine, forced them to the blind craggie mountaines which they inhabite; where having neither liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to reſt, nor meanes to meet with victuals, beſide a truce, they required to have peace graunted unto them, and that through the motion and perſuaſion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Germanicopolis, whoſe authoritie (like unto the vantguard in battaile) hath alwayes beene among them of great force to ſway the reſt: and ſo after they had put in their pledges, as they were enjoyned, they continued a long time quiet, and attempted no hoſtilitie at all.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout the ſame time well neere, whiles <hi>Valentinian</hi> was gone forth warily, as he thought, to an expedition, an Aleman <note n="*" place="margin">Regalu.</note> Prince, named <hi>Rando,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king preparation long before for that which he deſigned, entred by ſtealth with a crue of ſouldiors lightly appointed to kill and rob, into <note n="*" place="margin">Moguntia, Maj<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or Mentz.</note> Magontiacum, when it was without a garriſon.

For when king <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicabius,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Vadomarius,</hi> in ſhew an effeminate and diſeaſed prince, but of courage bold and valiant, kindled oftentimes hote warres againſt us, great care and diligence was employed, that he might be made away and murthered, it mattered not how: and for that being aſſayled ſundrie times, he could not either be openly vanquiſhed, or privily betrayed, at the earneſt ſollicitation of our men murthered he was by the deceitfull hand of one of his owne miniſters, belonging to the privie chamber. After whoſe death, the enemies in ſome ſort gave over their hoſtile rodes and incurſions: howbeit, the murtherer, for dread of puniſhment which he feared, in caſe the buſineſſe had beene diſcovered, got himſelfe over as faſt as he could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Romane ground. After this, preparation was made with good pauſe and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, as alſo by ſundrie kinds of forces, of an expedition againſt the Alemanes, and the ſame of greater puiſſance than uſually had beene, conſidering that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the State required no leſſe; becauſe the faithleſſe ſtirres of a nation, whoſe forces might ſoone be renewed, were feared: and our ſouldiors nevertheleſſe were enkindled againſt them, for their ſuſpected conditions; who feeble now and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants, yet ſhortly after threatening deadly and mortall hoſtilitie, gave them no reſt at all, nor ceſſation of armes. <hi>Valentinian</hi> therefore, together with <hi>Gratian,</hi> having aſſembled an huge hoaſt, well furniſhed as well with armes as victuals, and ſent for <hi>Sebastian</hi> the lieutenant, together with the bands of Illyricum and Italie, whereof hee had the regiment to joyne with them, in the very freſh prime of the yeare ſet forward, marching in foure ſquare battailons cloſe together and undivided; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the middeſt having <hi>Iovinus</hi> and <hi>Severus,</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">ſ</hi> expert and approoved warriors, flanking the ſides of the rankes on both hands, for feare they might be ſuddainely aſſayled. And ſo from thence, by the guidance of thoſe that were perfect in the wayes, having diſcovered beforehand the avenues through the plaine countries, lying out a great length, the ſouldiors advauncing ſoftly forward, yet very eagre of fight, as if they had found the enemies alreadie, in threatening manner gnaſhed their teeth for anger. And for that during certaine daies journey they could meet with none that made reſiſtance, there was put forth a regiment of certaine cohorts, who with the devouring flame of fire conſumed the ſtanding corne and houſes that they could ſet eye upon, all ſave only ſuch food, as their doubtfull ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſtood forced them to gather and keepe.

relation of his out-riders, that the barbarous enemies were diſcovered afarre off; who ſeeing no way or meanes left to ſave their lives, unleſſe by a ſpeedie encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they defended themſelves, preſuming boldly upon their skilfulneſſe in the wayes, with one mind and accord gained a verie high mountaine, by the meanes of rough and craggie hills, ſteepe and unacceſſable on everie ſide, ſave onely the North, whence it hath an eaſie and gentle fall or deſcent. Where having out of hand pitched downe their ſtanderds, as their manner is, and cryed the alarme on all hands, our ſouldiors eaſie to be directed at the commaundement of the Prince and leaders, ſtood their ground, waiting untill the banner were ſet up aloft, which was the ſignall to begin battaile in convenient time. Now, for as much as there was little or no time allowed to take any deliberation, whiles the impatient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſouldiors terribly tooke on and fumed on the one ſide, and the Alemans made horrible noyſes on the other, this courſe onely the ſhortneſſe of time and quicke diſpatch admitted, namely, That <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> with his companies ſhould poſſeſſe himſelfe of that North part of the hills, which I ſaid had an eaſie deſcent, there with little adoe, if good luck were, to have the killing of the Germans as they ſhold flie. Which was not thought good to be put in practiſe in haſt. And while <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> was detained backe about the Corps de guard, and enſignes of the Ioviani, as who for his tender yeares could not yet endure the toyleſome perils of battails, <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi> as a captaine that liked well to hold off, and worke ſafely, vailing bonet, and ſaluting the centuries and maniples (without making any of the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders privie to his ſecret deſignement, and having none of his guard about his perſon) rode out with ſome few in his companie, whoſe induſtrie and fidelitie he had good proofe of, to view and diſcover the bottomes of the hills; giving it out (as he was an arrogant prizer and prayſer of himſelfe) That there might bee ſome other way found out, leading up to thoſe high and difficult cliffs, beſide that which the fore-riders had diſcovered. As he went therefore out of the way, through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne and moiſt mariſhes, he had ſurely loſt his life by a ſodaine rode of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, beſtowed in ambuſh among the craggie and broken cliffes, but that he tooke himſelfe to the laſt helpe in time of neceſſitie, and ſetting ſpurres to his horſe, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped through the ſlipperie mire, got away, and ſhrowded himſelfe within the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the legions, and ſo eſcaped a ſodaine and unlooked for daunger, whereto he was ſo neere, that a gentleman of his chamber who carried his helmet richly ſet with gold and pretious ſtones together with the verie caſe periſhed quite, and could never after be found alive or dead. After reſt therefore graunted for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of their bodies, and the banner erected, which is woont to give ſignall and warning to battaile, at the menacing ſound of the trumpets kindling their courage, <hi>Salvius</hi> and <hi>Lupicinus,</hi> two valiant young Knights, choſen of purpoſe to give the onſet in daungerous ſervice; the <hi rend="sup">t</hi> one a <note n="*" place="margin">or one of the guard.</note> Targuetier, the other of the Gentiles band before all others readily ſtepped forth and led the way with a moſt bold reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, toward the battailons as they began to advance, with a terrible noiſe ſtirring and inticing them forward: and thus brandiſhing their ſpeares, when they were come to the foreſaid cliffes that ſtood againſt them, and endevoured maugre the Alemans (who ſhoved and thruſt ſore upon them) to gaine the higher ground, thither came all the maine force of the armie: and in the end, following hard after theſe ring-leaders through the thickets of buſhes, and rough brambles and bryers, with much ſtraining of their ſtrength got up to the high toppes of the mountaine. With a great ſtomacke therefore of both parts the conflict began by the deadly

dint &amp; point of the ſword to be tried: and of the one ſide the Romans more skilfull ſouldiors, and on the other the barbarous enemies, though fierce, yet unwarie and inconſiderat, coped and joyned hand to hand. And verily our armie diſplayed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie large, and ſpreading forth the wings to encloſe the enemies on both ſides, aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them ſore, terrified as they were with hideous outcries, neighing of horſes, and ſounding of trumpets: yet nevertheleſſe tooke they heart againe and boldly reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. And thus for a while the hoſts in equall ballance of fortune maintained fight with no ſmall ado and endevour, whiles the conflict continued with mutual killing and ſlaying on either ſide. At length ſuch was the valiant courage of the Romans, that the enemies rankes were broken, and for feare ſo ſhufled together, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt were mingled with the hindmoſt: and whiles they ſeeke to get away by good footmanſhip, pierced through they were with caſting darts and javelins that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies launced at them. And in the end, whiles they run fetching their wind ſhort and all wearie, they laid open to them that followed their hammes, the calves of their legges, and their backes. In concluſion, after many of them were beaten downe, <hi>Sebastian</hi> placed with a freſh companie for ſupply at the back of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, ſlew part of them that had ſlipped and eſcaped away, by reaſon they were hemmed in on that ſide that they tooke no heed of: the reſt diſperſed, betooke themſelves to the lurking corners of the woods. In this conflict there dyed of our part alſo, men of no ſmall account, among whom was <hi>Valerianus,</hi> the principall of all the <note n="*" place="margin">Domeſtici.</note> guard in ordinarie, and a certaine eſquier or targuetier, borne a verie evirate Eunuch, but ſuch an expert and approved warriour, that he might be compared ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with old <hi>Sicinius</hi> or <hi>Sergius.</hi> Theſe exploits thus performed with ſuch varietie of accidents, the ſouldiors returned unto their Winter harbours, and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours to Triers.</p>

it is, that I might feare. In the firſt warre of the Medes, when the Perſians had ſpoyled Aſia, beſetting the cities herein with huge and puiſſant forces, yea, and threatening the defendants thereof with terrible torments and dolorous death, they brought the people, thus ſhut up and beſieged, to this extremitie, that they all, ſore afflicted with great and grievous calamities, after they had killed their owne deare wives and children, and throwne their mooveable goods into the fire, caſt themſelves alſo by heapes after them, ſtriving a vie who might be for moſt in that commune flame, that conſumed them and their countrey together.

Which for expedition ſake was ſoone graunted. <hi>Maximinus</hi> therefore having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived matter to worke miſchiefe upon, diſcharged and uttered his inbred rigour, that ſtucke cloſe unto his cruell heart: as oftentimes doe theſe ſavage beaſts, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in the Amphitheatres or Shew-places, when by breaking their backe grates and dores in pieces, they get at length to be at libertie. And when this matter was many times handled and diſcuſſed, in flouriſhes (as it were) and ſhewes, ſo that ſome having their ſides gaſhed and torne, nominated certaine noble perſons, as if they had uſed workers of miſchiefe by the meanes of their dependants, and other baſe fellowes, this divelliſh Inquiſitor noting as well the parties accuſed as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and tracing them (as they ſay) by the foot, roved further, and in a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous relation advertiſed the prince, That the wleked and leawd acts which many committed in Rome, could not poſſibly be either ſearched out or puniſhed, but by more ſharpe and quicke juſtice. Who upon the knowledge hereof being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged (as he was an enemie to vices, rather rigorous than ſevere) by vertue of one precept or warrant directed for ſuch cauſes, which hee mingled with an arrogant intention of treaſon, decreed, That all thoſe, whom the juſtice of auncient lawes, and the judgement of ſacred princes had exempted from bloudie inquiſitions, ſhould, if the caſe ſo required, be put to cruell examinations by torture. And to the end that a duple authority, and the ſame ſtrained to the height, might patch matters together, to the utter undoing of perſons in higher place, unto this <hi>Maximinus</hi> (ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to rule at Rome as deputie Pręfect) he joined in commiſſion for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and determining of theſe things (which were a framing to the danger of many) <hi>Leo,</hi> a Notarie afterwards, maſter of the Offices, a very ſwaſh-buckler at every fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, a knowne robber, and a Pannonian; one who breathed foorth of his ſavage mouth crueltie, and yet was nevertheleſſe greedie ſtill of mans bloud.

And now by this time, when the trumpets of domeſticall miſeries ſounded, and all men were amazed to ſee the horrible ſtate of the world how it went, beſide many cruell and unmercifull examples (the varietie and number whereof is incomprehenſible) moſt notable was the death of <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> an advocate, whom upon a ſlight and curſarie weighing of proofes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, he condemned to death, for daring by <note n="*" place="margin">Magick, Sorcerie, and Enchantments</note> indirect and wicked acts to ſeeke the mariage of one <hi>Hiſpanilla.</hi> And becauſe I ſuppoſe that ſome men who haply ſhall read theſe reports, will be readie to ſearch exquiſitly into particulars, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove me, keeping a ſtirre and ſaying, This was done firſt, and not that; or ſuch things are overſlipt which themſelves ſaw: thus farre forth we are to give ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto them, namely, That all things are not worthy to be put downe in writing, which paſſed among meane and baſe perſons: neither, if that ſhould have beene needfull, had we ſufficient inſtruction from the verie records, conſidering how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny publique miſeries and misfortunes were ſo rife and hot, and that this new furie uncurbed and unreſtrained, made a generall pudder and confuſion, whiles it was evidently knowne, there was not (a thing much feared) any lawfull proceeding to judgement, but a ceſſation of all law and juſtice.

And the Princes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure being asked, What ſhould be done with him? hee committed the managing of this cauſe unto the Senat. Who finding by the equall ballance of juſtice how the caſe ſtood, and thereupon confining him to Boae, a place in Dalmatia, could hardly endure the Emperours wrath, who chafed mightily when hee underſtood, that a man deſtined (as himſelfe intended) to death, had his puniſhment by a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſentence. For theſe and many ſuch like examples, the daungers ſeene in a few, men begun to feare would light upon them. And leaſt, if ſo many enormities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing winked at, and creeping on ſtill by little and little, there might grow whole heapes of miſeries, by vertue of a decree paſſed by the <note n="*" place="margin">the Senators.</note> Nobilitie, embaſſadors were diſpatched unto the Emperour, by name <hi>Pretextatus</hi> who had beene Prefect of the citie, <hi>Venustus</hi> ſometime deputie-Prefect, and <hi>Minervius</hi> late a Conſular Governor of a Province, with this ſupplication, That there ſhould not bee inflicted puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more grievous than the offences required; and that no Senatour (after an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled and unlawfull manner) might be expoſed unto tortures. Who being admitted into the Conſiſtorie, when they made report of theſe particulars afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; as <hi>Valentinian</hi> denied that ever he ordained ſuch a courſe, and cryed out, that he was traduced and ſuſtained abuſe, <hi>Eupraxius</hi> the Queſtor in modeſt tearmes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him for it. By whoſe libertie of ſpeech, that cruell proceeding thus begun, which exceeded all precedents of rigour, was reformed. About this time <hi>Lollianus</hi> a young gentleman, in the verie prime of his youth, the ſonne of <hi>Lampadius,</hi> who had beene Prefect, being by <hi>Maximinus,</hi> who looked narrowly into his cauſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed to have copied forth a booke of <note n="*" place="margin">as magick, witch. craft, charmes &amp;c.</note> diveliſh arts (when by reaſon of yong yeres his head was not well ſtayed) and upon the point to be ſent into exile (as it was fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) at the motion and inſtigation of his father appealed to the Emperour.

Moreover <hi>Pafius</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> Senators both, convinced to have polluted themſelves with the damnable ſleights of poiſoning and ſorcerie, were by the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive ſentence of the ſame <hi>Maximinus</hi> put to death.

And now convenient it is, as I ſuppoſe, to declare the cauſe that drave headlong upon his owne death and deſtruction <hi>Aginatius,</hi> a man of noble aunceſtors deſcended, according as it hath beene conſtantly reported: For, as touching this matter, there be no evident re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords extant. <hi>Maximinus,</hi> whiles he was yet Prefect of the corne and victuals, puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing and brawling ſtill in a proud ſpirit of his owne, and having gotten no meane inſtigations and incouragement of boldneſſe, proceeded ſo farre as to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>Probus,</hi> in the ranke of right honourable perſons the greateſt of all other, and, by vertue of the Prefecture of the Pretorium, a governor of provinces. Which, <hi>Aginatius</hi> taking to be a mightie indignitie, &amp; ſetting it alſo to his heart, that in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of cauſes <hi>Olybrius</hi> had preferred <hi>Maximinus</hi> before him, conſidering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had been deputie-Prefect of Rome, ſecretly in familiar talke ſhewed unto <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> That the vaine man ſpurning as he did againſt perſons of high deſert might be overthrowne and brought to confuſion, if he thought ſo good. Theſe letters, as ſome affirmed, <hi>Probus</hi> ſent (making no bodie privie therto but the bearer) unto <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximinus</hi> as ſtanding in great feare of him, growne now more cunning and expert in doing miſchiefe, and beſides in grace and reputation with the Emperour. Which when he had read, the man fell into ſuch a heat of rage, that from thenceforth hee bent all his engines, and levelled his bolts at <hi>Aginatius,</hi> like to ſome ſerpent woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſquized by a knowne perſon. Beſide this, there was another greater cauſe of practiſing the overthrow of <hi>Aginatius,</hi> the which brought him to utter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For he accuſed <hi>Victorinus,</hi> now dead, That whiles he lived hee had ſold the friendſhip of <hi>Maximinus,</hi> and gained by his proceedings: by whoſe laſt will and teſtament himſelfe had received no ſmall legacies. And in like malapert ſaucineſſe he threatened his wife <hi>Anepſia,</hi> to go to law and by litigious ſuits to moleſt her: Who fearing theſe troubles, to the end ſhe might be protected alſo by the aid of <hi>Maximinus,</hi> feined and deviſed, That her husband in his wil which he lately made, left unto him a legacie of three thouſand pound weight in ſilver: Who burning in exceſſive deſire and covetouſneſſe (for he was not without this vice alſo) claimed
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:14644:168"/>
the one moitie of the inheritance. But not reſting contented herewith, as being but a ſmall portion, and nothing ſufficient, he deviſed another feat, which, as hee thought, was both honeſt and ſafe: and becauſe he would not forgo his hold of ſo good meanes offered unto him to gaine a wealthie patrimonie, he ſued to have the daughter in law of <hi>Victorinus</hi> (whom his wife <hi>Anepſia</hi> bare unto a former huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band) for to be his ſonnes wife: the which with the aſſent of the woman was ſoon obtained and concluded.</p>

I ſuppoſe they almiſle the mark: and untill we may meet with a more perfect copie I cannot determine. The place I doubt is corrupt.</note> Tamuſa (as it were) not grounded verily upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proofes or preſumptions, but like to doe miſchiefe unto many guiltleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: And alſo commaunded ſundrie times <hi>Mutianus</hi> and <hi>Barbatus,</hi> his daily offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and miniſters, fellowes moſt apt and fit to deceive others, ſeverally to bee clapt up. Theſe, as if they bewayled their owne wofull miſhaps, whereby they made ſemblance that they were wronged and oppreſſed, aggravating ſtill the crueltie of the ſaid judge, and iterating the ſame ſpeeches verie often, pretended and affirmed, That for perſons ſtanding then accuſed and in trouble, there was now no other meanes or remedie remaining to ſave their owne lives, unleſſe they would ſeeme to charge and accuſe ſome of the nobilitie of great crimes, who if they were once joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them in ſocietie of daunger, then they warranted them they might be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily quit and abſolved. By reaſon whereof, conſidering that the vile impietie of theſe courſes proceeded further now than to abjects neere at hand, it came to paſſe that many a man had his hands ſtreight manacled; and thoſe of noble birth were ſeene as unregarded, in poore plight and much diſtreſſed. Neither ought any of them to be blamed, when in their ſimple ſalutations they crouched and bowed their bodies ſo low, as that they welneere touched the verie ground, conſidering they heard this robber with the peſtiferous breath of his mouth come out often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with this note, If he were ſo diſpoſed, that no perſon could poſſibly be found innocent. Which words turning quickly into deeds, had beene ynough, I aſſure you, to have terrified as good men as ever <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> or <hi>Cato</hi> were. For in this wiſe altogether were matters carried, that ſome mens eies were never drie, but ſhed freſh teares in the beholding of other folks miſeries, a thing that commonly in this life happeneth to men, upon ſundrie troubles and croſſe accidents of their owne. Howbeit this hard hearted judge how ever he went oftentimes from the courſe of right and juſtice, yet in one ſpeciall point tollerable he was. For, otherwhiles hee would ſpare and pardon ſome if he were requeſted and intreated: which, as we
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:14644:169"/>
read in <hi>Tullie,</hi> ſavoureth yet of ſome vice in this place of authoritie. <hi>For if wrath</hi> (quoth he) <hi>be implacable, it is rigour and bitterneſſe in the higheſt degree; but if it be exorable, it is as great a lightneſſe and vanitie: which notwithstanding, as in choice of bad things, is to be preferred before bitterneſſe.</hi> After this, when <hi>Leo</hi> went forward, and was admitted his ſucceſſor, <hi>Maximinus</hi> being ſent for to the princes court, and advaunced to be Praetor Praetorio, became never a jot milder, but did harme ſtill even a farre off, like to the ſerpents called Baſiliskes or Cocatrices. Againſt that time, or not much before, the very beeſomes wherewith the noblemens * Curia uſed to be ſwept, were ſeene to bloome and beare bloſſomes: and this portended, that ſome perſons of moſt contemptible and baſe condition, were to be raiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to high degrees of rule and authoritie. And although it be now high time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne unto the order of our Hiſtorie begun, yet without hindering the proceſſe of times, we will tarrie a while in rehearſing ſome few particulars, that through the iniquitie of thoſe, who governed as deputie Pręfects in the citie, were done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than ought to have beene; which were carried all according to the will and pleaſure of <hi>Maximinus,</hi> by the ſame miniſters, as his agents or apparitors. After him commeth <hi>Vrſicinus</hi> in place; a man more enclined to milder courſes: who becauſe he would be warie and civile, gave information, and referred over to the Emperour <hi>Eſaias,</hi> with others kept in hold, for committing adulterie with <hi>Ruffina;</hi> and who had gone about to accuſe and indict her husband <hi>Marcellus,</hi> late a Purſivant or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencer, of Treaſon: And therefore he, deſpiſed as a lingering delayer, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing meet for the ſtout execution and quicke diſpatch of theſe matters, was put out of his deputicſhip. After him ſucceeded <hi>Simplicius Hemonenſis;</hi> who of a profeſſor in Grammar became counſellor unto <hi>Maximinus</hi> after the adminiſtration of his deputieſhip: a man neither ſtout nor prowd, but of a crooked and terrible aſpect; who, ſeeming to frame his words to a kind of modeſtie, ſtudied and plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the miſchiefe of many. And firſt he put to death <hi>Ruffina,</hi> together with all thoſe that were either parties culpable in the matter of adulterie, or privie thereto: as touching whom, <hi>Vrſicinus</hi> (as I ſaid before) had given information: Then, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, without any difference of guiltie or innocent. For in this bloudie bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, contending with <hi>Maximinus</hi> (marſhalled as it were in the maine battaile before him) he endevoured to outgoe him in cutting the ſinewes (as one would ſay) of noble families: imitating <hi rend="sup">g</hi>

But after that <hi>Fauſiana</hi> was condemned, their indictments being taken, and themſelves peremptorily called to their anſweres by vertue of edicts, hid themſelves farther out of the way: and as for <hi>Abienus,</hi> hee ſhrowded himſelfe privily a long time in <hi>Anepſiaes</hi> houſe. But, as uſually it falleth out, that when folke are once going downe, ſome croſſe accidents or other unloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for will be ſure to attend upon them, to aggravate their calamities, a ſervant of <hi>Anepſia,</hi> named <hi>Apaudulus,</hi> taking it very grievouſly, that his wife had borne ſome ſtripes in the houſe, went forth by night, and gave notice of all unto <hi>Simplicius:</hi> So there were officers ſent, who upon the ſaid diſcoverie made, had them away out of their lurking place; and <hi>Abienus</hi> verily, upon the crime of adulterie ſtrongly enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt him, which he was ſaid to have committed upon the bodie of <hi>Anepſia,</hi> ſuffered death: but the woman, to the end that by deferring her puniſhment, ſhe might have aſſured hope to ſave her life, avouched, That being by curſed and <note n="*" place="margin">by enchantmem and ſorcerie.</note> wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked arts aſſayled, ſhe ſuffered that diſhonour and violence in <hi>Aginatius</hi> his houſe. Theſe things as they happened, <hi>Simplicius</hi> rung out againe into the Emperours eares; and <hi>Maximinus,</hi> who abode there, upon a malitious mind that he bare againſt <hi>Aginatius</hi> alreadie for the cauſe above ſpecified, now that his privie grudge was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his power and authoritie more incenſed, made an exceeding earneſt ſuit, that there might be a letter ſent backe againe, for to have him executed. And verily this braine-ſicke incitor, and mightie withall, ſoone obtained ſo much: but fearing the heavie load of envie and hatred, in caſe a man of noble birth ſhould come to his death by ſentence of judgement, that <hi>Simplicius,</hi> both his owne counſellor and friend alſo, pronounced, kept with himſelfe for a while the Emperours precept; being at a ſtay, and doubting whom he might find out eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be a truſtie and ſure executor of this horrible deſigne. And at the laſt (as commonly like will eaſily ſort with like) he lighted upon one <hi>Doryphoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> a Gaule, and a bold franticke perſon; on whom, for promiſing ſhortly to accompliſh this ſervice, he tooke order, that a deputieſhip ſhould be conferred, and to him he delivered the precept, together with the Emperours letters, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the man, cruell though he was, yet unexpert and unskilfull, with what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition he might without all let or impeachment diſpatch <hi>Aginatius,</hi> who perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, upon finding out any meanes of delay, would eſcape and be gone. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryphorianus</hi> ſped himſelfe in all haſt, and tooke long journeyes till hee came to Rome: and at his firſt comming, before all complements of ſalutation ended, he caſt about, and with great diligence ſought, by what forcible device, with the helpe of ſome others, he might take away the life of a Senatour, ſo nobly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended: and having intelligence, that but a while before he had beene found in a farme-houſe or mannour of his owne, himſelfe with a ſterne countenance determined to have the judiciall hearing of <hi>Anepſia,</hi> as the chiefe of all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors; and that during the ugly darke night, what time folkes minds, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with horror and terror, uſe to be dull and dead, as among an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of examples, <hi rend="sup">h</hi>

Yet for all this, the great and earneſt care of the Emperour, together with the painefull labour of the dutifull ſouldiors (who oftentimes when they were at worke ſtood up to the chin plunged in water) overcame all difficulties. And ſo at the laſt, not without danger of ſome, the garriſon forts were rid quite fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the trouble wrought by the mightie wandering river, and now ſtand ſtrong and ſure.

But a farre off, as if the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of hell haunted the like theeves and pricked them forward; the Maratocupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, moſt fierce brigands, the inhabitants of a <note n="*" place="margin">Maratocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenum.</note> towne carrying that name in Syria, ſcituat neere unto Apamia, raunged on everie ſide: and a wonder it was what a number they were, and how cunning and craftie beſide: In this regard alſo much dreaded, for that making ſhew of ſubſtantial marchants houſes, villages and towns: neither could any man beware of their ſodaine comming, ſetting as they did their journey not to any one appointed place, but to ſundrie quarters, and thoſe farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and in one word, breaking in whereſoever the wind ſerved to conduct them. For which verie cauſe, the Saxons are feared above other enemies, doing that they doe all on a ſodaine. And albeit many mens goods were given and dealt among theſe confederat theeves, yet incontinent herewith, when they were once ſet a madding and entred into any intended furious action, they committed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full murders, as being no leſſe bloud-thirſtie than greedie of prey. But leaſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting everie particular occurrent I ſhould hinder the courſe and proceeding of my ſtorie, it ſhall ſuffice to put downe this one moſt miſchievous practiſe of theirs. A damned crew of theſe godleſſe and ungracious folke being gathered in a plump together, reſembling in outward ſhew the whole office of a Receivor or Auditor, and the Iudge himſelfe, in a darke evening at the dolefull ſound of trumpet, and voyce of crier, entred a citie, and with ſword in hand beſet the ſtately and ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous built houſe of a certaine noble and principall perſonage, as if he had beene out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed, and by ſpeciall commiſſion to be ſlaine: where, after they had ſeized into their hands and carryed away houſhold-ſtuffe of much worth, becauſe they of the houſe being ſodainely taken, and their wits maskered, had not defended the maſter therof, ſlew a number, and before returne of the day-light departed and went their wayes a great pace. But when thus furniſhed and laden with the ſpoyle of many, for nothing went beſide their hands, that was not too hot or too heavie (ſuch was the ſweetneſſe they found in theſe cheits) intercepted they were by a power that the Emperour raiſed, and being over-matched loſt their lives to the verie laſt man: yea and their iſſue and progenie, then but young and ſmall, for feare they ſhould grow up, like unto their parents, were in the ſame manner utterly deſtroyed, and their dwelling houſes ſubverted, which with the lamentable loſſes of many they had bravely built. And thus verily went things according to the narration afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. But <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> a noble and renowmed captain, having gotten heart and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious vigour, taking his journey from Auguſta, which in old time they called
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:14644:171"/>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">London.</note> Lundinium, with a power of ſouldiors that in his politique induſtrie hee had levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and trained to his hand, brought exceeding great ſuccour unto the troubled and confuſed ſtate of the Britans, gaining before hand ſuch places everie where, as gave advantage to annoy the barbarous enemies, and enjoyning the common ſouldiors no ſervice, whereof himſelfe tooke not the eſſay with a cheerefull heart. And in this kind as he performed the principall part of a ſtout ſouldior, and fulfilled the carefull function of an excellent leader, by diſcomfiting and putting to flight ſundrie nations, whom inſolent pride nouriſhed with ſecuritie, had incenſed and incited to ſet upon the Romans territories, he reſtored wholly into the former ſtate cities and caſtles which had ſuſtained many loſſes, yea eſtabliſhed peace ſurely founded for a long time. Now, there happened whiles he managed theſe affaires a foule matter, like to breake out to a daungerous miſchiefe, if it had not beene quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the verie beginning of the enterpriſe. One <hi>Valentinus</hi> in <note n="*" place="margin">Stiria.</note> Pannonia Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, a man of a proud ſpirit, brother unto the wife of <hi>Maximinus</hi> that curſed and miſchievous deputie, afterwards Praefect, being baniſhed into Britannie for an hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous act committed, as one impatient of reſt, like ſome noiſome wild beaſt, upon a certaine ſwelling homour of pride, roſe up to worke miſchiefe and innovation in the State againſt <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> whom he perceived to be the onely man able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his wicked deſignes. Howbeit, caſting many wayes about both cloſely and openly, as the gale of his unmeaſurable deſire roſe higher, hee ſolicited the exiled perſons and the ſouldiors, promiſing (as the time would affoord) rewards for their attempts, thereby to draw them on to his purpoſe. And now, when the time drew neere, that their attempts ſhould take effect, the <note n="*" place="margin">Theodoſius.</note> warlike leader aforeſaid, advertiſed hereof by ſuch as were meet to give information, and thereby readie to adventure, as alſo upon a reſolute and couragious heart, forward ynough to be revenged of ſuch as were detected, committed <hi>Valentinus</hi> verily with ſome few of his moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward confederats, unto captain <hi>Dulcitius</hi> for to be executed with death according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But in his militarie skill and policie, wherein he excelled all men living in thoſe dayes, gueſſing at future daungers, he inhibited all inquiſitions to bee made as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reſt of the conſpirators with him, leaſt if this feare proceeding were once ſpred among many, the tempeſtuous troubles of the provinces, now well allayed, ſhould revive againe. From hence, turning himſelfe to the diſtreſſe of many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and thoſe of needfull conſequence, now that all danger was quite paſt (for that it was for certaine knowne, that propitious fortune never failed him in all his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes) he reedified and repaired cities, the garriſon caſtles alſo, as I have ſaid, and the marches he defended with out-watches, with guards &amp; fore-fences. And thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recovered the province againe, which had yeelded ſubjection to the enemies, he reduced it unto the priſtine eſtate; ſo, as by his owne relation and report made, it both had a lawfull governor, and alſo was from that time called <hi rend="sup">k</hi> Valentia, at the pleaſure of the Prince. The Areans, a kind of people inſtituted by thoſe in aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time (concerning whom I have ſaid ſomewhat in the acts of <hi>Constans)</hi> who by little and little were fallen into diſorders and enormities, he removed from their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: as being manifeſtly convicted, that induced with the greatneſſe of rewards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and more promiſed, they had otherwhiles revolted unto the Barbarians, what was in hand and a doing among us. For, their office was this, by running a great ground to be curſitours to and fro, and to intimate unto our captaines upon the marches, what ſturres there were among the neighbour nations.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving thus a long time and farre digreſſed from the citie buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (ſuch was the heape of forraine affaires that forced me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) I will returne to a briefe declaration thereof, beginning at the Prefectſhip of <hi>Olybrius,</hi> which was exceeding quiet and mild. Who leaving at no time the conſtant courſe of gentleneſſe and humanitie, was ſolicitous and carefull that no deed or word of his ſavouring of rigour ſhould paſſe in any place: a moſt bitter enemie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer againſt falſe accuſations, abridging whereſoever he could the gaine accrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Exchequer: an abſolute diſcerner and judge of things that are juſt, and verie temperat towards thoſe that were under his juriſdiction. But there was a vice, and the ſame verily little hurtfull to the Commonwealth (howbeit a foule blot in a judge of high place) that darkened all theſe good parts: for that he paſſed the whole courſe and carriage, in manner, of his privat life in clining to riot in ſtage plaies and amorous delights, ſuch as were neither forbidden nor diſhoneſt. After him <hi>Ampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> ruled the citie, a man given himſelfe alſo to his pleaſures, borne at Antioch, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from being Maſter of the Offices to a double Proconſulſhip, and from thence long after to the high dignitie of <note n="*" place="margin">of the Pretorium.</note> Prefect: a man otherwiſe of merrie diſpoſition, and moſt meet to win the peoples favour; but now and then rough and rigorous, and would God he had beene ſtedfaſt and conſtant in his purpoſe: for, in ſome part, though it were but little, he might have reformed the inſtigations to gluttonie and ſhut up naughtie houſes of riot, had he not taken to looſe and laſcivious waies, and thereby loſt that glorie which would long time have lived. For, once orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he had, That no wine Taverne ſhould be opened before the <note n="*" place="margin">ten of the clocke.</note> fourth houre of the day, nor any of the vulgar ſort <hi rend="sup">1</hi> heat his water, or until a certaine time of the day any cookes or skullians ſet out to ſale fleſh boyled or roaſted: Neither would hee have any man of honeſt calling be ſeene eating abroad without his owne doores. Which ſhamefull abuſes, and others greater than theſe, neglected by continual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimuling and counivencie, grew ſo rife and common, without all ſtint and gage, that even <hi rend="sup">m</hi> 
                  <hi>Epimenides</hi> himſelfe of <note n="*" place="margin">Candie.</note> Crete, if, after the faſhion of fables acted on the ſtage, he ſhould be raiſed from the dead againe, and returne into our world, would not be ſufficient alone to clenſe Rome. So great was the corruption of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable vices that poſſeſſed the moſt part of the people. And firſt will we ſet down the diſorders of the Nobilitie, as divers times we have done, as the opportunitie of places hath required: then, afterwards of the commons, by way of a briefe digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion knitting up ſuch matters as come into our minds. Some growing to be, as they
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:14644:172"/>
imagine, conſpicuous by their glorious and goodly fore names extoll themſelves above all meaſure: as for example, when they are called <hi>Ruburti, Plabunij, Pago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nij, Geriones</hi> and <hi>Dalij,</hi> together with <hi>Tarracij</hi> and <hi>Perrasij,</hi> and many other ſuch trim and brave ſounding titles of their originall deſcent. Some yee have againe, whom rufling in their ſilkes and velvets, there follow in traine (as if they were to be led unto the place of execution, or, to ſpeake without any evill preſaging offe, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering their armor together, where an hoſt is gone before) a number of ſervants by troupes, buſtling and making a great noyſe as they goe. Such as theſe, when they are entred within the vaulted roomes of any <note n="*" place="margin">Stew or hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe.</note> baine, attended with fiftie ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-men apeece at their heeles, crying out in menacing manner, Where? Where be they? if haply they have intelligence given them, that either ſome unknowne courtiſan hath on a ſodaine appeared, or a common ſtrumpet that ſometime hath proſtituted her ſelfe to the whole towne, or ſome old whore naught of her bodie, they run all at once ſtriving a vie who ſhall be formoſt; and after ſome dalliance with this ſtranger or new commer, they make love, and by way of much unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flatterie, fall to prayſing and extolling of her, as much as the Parthyans do <hi rend="sup">n</hi>

Of theſe there be ſome, who when they begin to be ſaluted, or greeted breaſt to breaſt, turning their heads awry when they ſhould be kiſſed, and brideling it like unto curſt and fierce bulls, offering unto their flattering favourites their knees or hands to kiſſe, ſuppoſing that favour ſufficient for them to live happily, and be made for ever; yea and that a ſtranger unto whom haply they be obliged, hath ynough and ynough againe of all manner of courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous uſage, in caſe he be but asked by them, What baine or water he frequenteth? or under whoſe roofe he lodgeth? And being ſuch grave perſons and lovers of vertue, as they take themſelves to be, if they once but underſtand of any man brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging word, there be either horſes or chariotiers comming to towne, from what place ſoever, they throng about him, and ply him with a number of queſtions, like as our forefathers with admiration beheld their two brethren <hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                  <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> when upon the relation of thoſe victories in auncient times, they filled all the citie with joy and mirth.

For, as they uſe to ſooth up vaine glorious ſouldiors in their proud homor, aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing unto them as to the demie-gods fellowes, the beſieging of cities, fighting of battailes, and ſlaying thouſands of enemies: even ſo theſe alſo, wondering at their columnes built arch-wiſe with ſtately and loftie fronts, their ſtone walls alſo trimly ſet out with beautifull and glorious colours, extoll noble men above the degree of mortall weights. Otherwhiles alſo at their feaſts, is the ballance called for to weigh the fiſhes and foules, yea and <hi rend="sup">p</hi> dormice to, that are ſet upon the boord.

Neither is this all. He fetcheth him in voluntarily to acknowledge himſelfe indebted unto him, and aſſoileth him not. On another ſide, the wife beating night and day (as the old proverbe ſayth) upon the ſame anvill, urgeth her husband to make his Will, and the husband as inſtantly importuneth his wife to do the ſame.

And upon long debating and conſultation, when this was thought in policie behoofefull for the Commonweale, after a truce concluded, and many tall and ſerviceable young men for the warres allowed (according to a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation &amp; condition drawne in that behalfe) the Saxons were permitted to depart without let and hinderance, to repaire unto the place from whence they came. For whom, devoid now of all feare, and upon their returne, certaine footmen of ours, ſent out ſecretly, lay in ambuſh within a valley, from whence they might with little adoe aſſayle as many as paſſed by. But it fell out farre otherwiſe with them than they hoped. For at the noyſe of the Saxons comming, ſome of our men being raiſed, leapt forth in an unſeaſonable time, and being ſuddainly diſcovered, whiles they make haſt to ſtrengthen themſelves, were put to flight by the Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yelling in a dolefull and hideous manner.

For, this fierce and cruell nation ever ſince the firſt beginning and riſing thereof, how ever they were abated with the varietie of accidents and chaunces, yet grow eftſoones ſo, as that a man would thinke they had not for many ages beene once touched. But as the Emperour had the approoving of one counſell after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at the length he reſolved upon this, That the <note n="*" place="margin">Burguignians.</note> Burgundians, a warlike nation, puiſſant for their huge multitude, and therefore dreadfull to all their neighbours, ſhould be rayſed up in armes for the rooting of them out. And many times hee wrot unto their kings by certaine truſtie and ſecret meſſengers, That at a fore-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time they ſhould ſodainely invade and ſurpriſe them, promiſing that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo in perſon paſſing over the Rhene with the Roman forces, would encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, being once affrighted, and ſeeking to avoid this unlooked-for power of armed men. Theſe letters of the Prince were thankefully and gladly received in two reſpects: Firſt, for that the Burgundians knew themſelves to bee of auncient time an ofspring deſcended from the Romans: and againe, becauſe they conteſted oftentimes with the Alemans about the ſalt-pits, and about their bounds: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ſent moſt choſen and picked bands: which, before that our ſouldiors were aſſembled together, being gone forward as farre as to the bankes of Rhene, whiles the Emperour was buſily occupied in rayſing of forts, terrified our men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding much. Wherefore, after they had ſtayed a ſmall while, when as neither <hi>Valentinian</hi> came at the day appointed according to promiſe, nor they could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing done that was undertaken, they diſpatched embaſſadours to the Court, requiring they might have ſome ayd ſent unto them: intending otherwiſe to returne home into their owne countrey, leaſt they ſhould expoſe their back parts naked to the enemies. Which when they perceived by circumſtances to be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that the Emperour trifled out the time, they departed from thence with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. When their kings and princes underſtood this, as if they had beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:14644:175"/>
and mocked, they fell into a rage, and after they had killed all the priſoners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into their native countries.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen Winter was paſt, <hi>Sapor</hi> king of the Perſians, exceeding arrogant upon the confidence that he had gotten by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer battailes, having ſupplied the number of his owne forces, and furniſhed them very ſtrongly, ſent his men of <note n="*" place="margin">Cataphractos, or ſouldiors in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete harneis.</note> armes, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and mercenarie common ſoldiors to breake out and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade our territories. Againſt theſe forces, <hi>Traianus</hi> a lieutenant and <hi>Vadomarius</hi> late king of the Alemans, went forth with right puiſſant bands, appointed by commaundement from the prince to obſerve thus much, rather to keepe off, than to aſſayle the Perſians firſt. Who being come to Vagabanta, a place renowmed for the legions that lodged there, they received the violent charge and brunt of the enemies troupes, ruſhing and running fiercely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them full againſt their wils, and of purpoſe giving ground and reculing backe, becauſe they would not firſt wound any of their enemies, nor be deemed culpable in breaking of the league; untill ſuch time as being forced upon extreame neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they joyned battaile, and having ſlaine a number of them, departed with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie. Yet betweene whiles, after ſome triall of light skirmiſhes on both ſides, and the ſame performed with ſundrie events, when truce by common conſent was concluded, and the Summer ſpent, the leaders of both parts departed aſunder, as yet not well accorded.

Now, when it came to this point, that the queſtion either of fact or attempt was hotely followed, <hi>Palladius</hi> confidently brake out into this manner of exclamation, That theſe were but light toyes now in hand, and fit to be paſſed over: as for me (quoth he) if I may be allowed to ſpeake, I will tell of greater matters, and ſuch as are to be feared indeed, and which being alreadie plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and well ſet forward, unleſſe better heed be taken, will bring all to confuſion.

And when they were all at a ſtand, who he ſhould be in thoſe dayes that ſo excelled all in vigour of mind and courage, it was thought, that <hi>Theodorus,</hi> now advaunced to the ſecond place among the <note n="*" place="margin">or Secretaties.</note> Notaries, ſurpaſſed the reſt. And verily he was no leſſe indeed than the world tooke him for. Forbeing of a noble and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient houſe deſcended in Gaule, and liberally brought up from the very firſt rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his childhood, in regard of his modeſtie, wiſdome, courteſie, credit, favor and learning right honourable, ſeemed alwaies better than the office and place that he held: accepted and beloved indifferently both of high and low: and the onely man he was (in maner) of all others, whoſe tongue not running at randon, but well adviſed what it ſpake, no feare of danger could ever ſtop. Over and above all this, the ſame <hi>Fiduſtius</hi> being now grievouſly tormented and mangled to the point of death, went on and ſaid, That upon his report <hi>Theodorus</hi> had learned all which he foretold by <hi>Euſerius,</hi> a man of ſingular skill and learning, and beſides a very hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſonage: for why? it was not long before that he had governed Aſia as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie Praefect.

And becauſe hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth no leſſe deceitfull, who wittingly paſſeth over what he knoweth was done, than he that feyneth things never done, wee deny not (for no man maketh doubt thereof) that the life of <hi>Valens,</hi> both oftentimes before by privie conſpiracies and then alſo, was plunged into moſt extreame daungers: and the ſwords blade by militarie men of his owne traine ſet cloſe to his verie throat, was by the oppoſition of Deſtinies put backe, as whom the ſayd Deſtinies had preordained to lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perils in Thracia. For, not onely in a certaine woodie place betweene An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch and Seleucia, whiles he lay ſweetly aſleepe afternoone in the ſhade, he was layd at by <hi>Sallustius,</hi> then one of the Seutarij, and oftentimes elſe forelayd by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: yet eſcaped he, for that the limits of his life ſet downe unto him from his verie nativitie, bridled thoſe horrible attempts. Like as it happened otherwhiles under he Emperours <hi>Commodus</hi> and <hi>Severus,</hi> whoſe life was moſt forcibly oft aſſayled, inſomuch as after many and ſundrie inteſtine daungers, the one within the liſts of the Amphitheatre, as he ſhould enter in to behold the ſights and games, with a ſpud or dagger was wounded almoſt to death, by <hi>Quintianus</hi> a Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and a man of unlawfull and unhoneſt life: the other in his verie later daies, as hee lay in his bed-chamber, through the counſell of <hi>Plautianus</hi> the Prefect, had beene unwares ſurpriſed and ſtabbed by the hands of <hi>Saturninus</hi> a Centurion, but that his owne ſonne, a young gentleman, came in to helpe and reſcue him.

purſuit proceeded in all haſt againſt offenders and innocent perſons indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently: So that, whiles the crime remained ſtill doubtfull, yet the Emperour made no doubt of the puniſhment, in ſo much as ſome heard they were condemned, before they underſtood that they were ſuſpected. Now, this inflexible purpoſe of his grew the more confirmed through the covetouſneſſe both of himſelfe, and of thoſe alſo who converſed then in the Court, gaping ſtill for more, and never lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their chawes together, which did ſet him on and pricke him ever forward: who if there were any mention made (and that was verie ſeldome) of humanitie and courteſie, tearmed it timorous dulneſſe: who alſo with their bloudie flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries corrupting the mind and intent of the man (that carried death in the tip of his tongue) and turning it to the worſt wayes, with boyſterous blaſts of unſeaſonable whirlewinds violently blew upon all, haſtening to overturne from the verie foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, moſt wealthy houſes and families. For, expoſed he was and lay open to the acceſſe of as manie as ſought the undoing of others, as being daungerouſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached with two vices: Firſt, for that he was intollerably angrie, and then moſt, when he ſhould have baſhed to be angrie: Againe, looke what he had heard by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret whiſperings and ſuggeſtions, through the advantage and opportunitie of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat admittance, in the ſwelling pride of a Prince, forbearing to examine whether the ſame were true or no, he entertained the ſame for undoubted truthes. Hence it came to paſſe, that under a pretenſe of clemencie many innocent perſons were thruſt out of doores, and driven headlong into exile: whoſe goods being gotten together and ſequeſtred into the common treaſurie, himſelfe alſo reduced to his owne proper gaines: in ſo much as condemned folke were faine to beg their bread and live of almes, ſore cruſhed with the miſerable ſtraits of dreadfull povertie: for feare whereof <hi rend="sup">a</hi>

And when everie man ſeeing none but himſelfe, was readie to ſhove his owne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent miſchiefe upon another, at length by leave and permiſſion of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, <hi>Theodorus</hi> beginning to ſpeak, at the firſt lay proſtrate before them, and craved pardon; then afterwards, urged more forcibly to make his anſwere, declared, That he had knowledge indeed of all this by <hi>Euſerius;</hi> but that he ſhould not give intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence thereof to the Emperour, as divers times he went about to doe, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred by him, who avowed, That by no unlawfull deſire of aſpiring unto regall dignitie, but by a certaine courſe of inevitable deſtinie, that which was hoped for, would of the owne accord come to paſſe. Then, as <hi>Euſerius</hi> being under the hand of bloudie tormentors, confeſſed the very ſame, <hi>Theodorus</hi> was by his owne letters convinced, which he had written by way of oblique circumlocutions unto <hi>Hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> implying thus much, That ſince he had alreadie conceived aſſured hopes from the Divinors and Prophets, he ſtood not now upon the ſubſtance of the thing, as doubting it, but was earneſt to know the circumſtance of the time, when his deſire ſhould be effected. After theſe points knowne, when they were had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and ſequeſtred apart, <hi>Eutropius,</hi> who at that time governed Aſia as Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull, was drawne within danger, and judicially indicted as privie and partie to this faction: but he went away without harme as unguiltie; for that <hi>Paſiphilus</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher acquited and cleared him: who notwithſtanding he was cruelly tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to this end, that by faſtening ſome lye upon him, he might defame and ſubvert him quite, could not be removed from the ſtate of a conſtant and ſtout mind. After theſe commeth in the Philoſopher <hi>Simonides,</hi> who verily in regard of his yeares was but a yong man, howbeit for his carriage the graveſt and preciſeſt perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our remembrance: who being informed againſt, for that he had taken know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this buſineſſe by the meanes of <hi>Fidustius,</hi> and perceiving, that the matter was weighed, not according to truth, but the will and direction of <note n="*" place="margin">

All which matters being throughly from point to point examined, the Emperour in a correſpondencie to the counſell of the Commiſſioners, under one ſentence and warrant commaundeth they ſhould all be put to death: and ſo, in the ſight of an infinite number of people, who ſcarcely could behold ſo abhominable a ſpectacle without horror of mind, but filled the heavens againe with mones and complaints (for the miſerie of each one ſeemed to be the common caſe of them all) brought they were forth together, and in pitifull manner had their throats cut, all ſave <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides,</hi> whom onely that cruell <note n="*" place="margin">

And after him, for certaine daies following, a multitude almoſt of all ſorts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, whom by name to reckon were a difficult piece of worke, driven within the dangerous toile and ſnares of falſe imputations, made worke for the hangmen and executioners untill they wearied them out, after they had been maimed and lamed before with ſtretching upon the racke, with the weightie pelts of plumbets, and the ſmart laſhes of the whip. And ſome there were that ſuffered death without any breathing time or reſpite graunted, even whiles it was in queſtion, Whether they ſhould be executed, or no? So there was nothing but carnage and ſlaughter ſcene in every place of the citie, as if ſo many beaſts had been ſlaine by the butchers knife. After this, to allay the envie and diſpleaſure of the people for ſuch a bloudie maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, an infinit number of bookes and many heaps of volumes were gotten together, and before the Iudges burnt: ſuch as were fetched out of ſundrie houſes, as if (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) they had beene unlawfull and prohibited; whereas indeed the moſt part of them were Tables and Indexes of the liberall Sciences &amp; of the [civile] Law. And not long after, that noble Philoſopher <hi>Maximus</hi> (a man of great name and renowme for his learning, out of whoſe moſt plentiful diſcourſes, <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperor became ſufficiently furniſhed for skill and knowledge) was charged to have heard thoſe verſes of the Oracle aboveſaid: and having graunted indeed, that he knew thereof, (howbeit, in conſideration of his profeſſion blabbed not forth ſuch things as were to be concealed, but voluntarily foretold, that the ſeekers of this Oracle themſelves ſhould ſurely ſuffer and die for it) was led to Epheſus, the place of his nativitie, and there cut ſhorter by the head: he found and learned by this laſt experience at his death, That the iniquitie of a Iudge &amp; Commiſſioner is more heavie than any crime whatſoever. <hi>Diogenes</hi> alſo intangled within the ſnares of impious falſitie (a man deſcended of a noble houſe for his wit, eloquence at the barre, and ſweet behavior, otherwiſe excellent, late ruler of Bithynia) to the end that his rich livelode and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie might be ranſacked and taken from him, was put to death.

For having gotten licence to nominate whom he would, without reſpect of calling and degree, as tainted with unlawfull and forbidden arts, like to an hunter skilfull in marking the ſecret tracts and muces of wild beaſts, encloſed many a man within his lamentable net and toyle: ſome, as ſtained with the skill of poyſoning and ſorcerie; others, as privie and acceſſarie to thoſe that plotted and practiſed treaſon. And to the end, that not ſo much as the very wives might be allowed and have leiſure to bewaile their husbands miſeries, ſtraightwaies there were certaine ſuborned and ſent out: who being come to ſome ſpeciall houſes of marke, rifling the houſehold ſtuffe, and peruſing the writings of any one condemned to ſuffer, ſhould privily foiſt in ſome old wives charmes, or ridiculous love-ſpels &amp; enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, deviſed and forged to bring innocent folke to miſchiefe. Which being read in court before the Iudges, where no law, no religion, or conſcience, no equitie made difference betweene truth and lyes, without pleading in defence of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they had their goods taken from them, yea, and without touch and attaint of any fault, young men and others indifferently, after they had beene lamed in all their lims, were had away in chaires to execution. Hence it came to paſſe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Eaſt Provinces, that all men for feare of the like, burnt their libraries and cloſets, ſuch a generall terror poſſeſſed every one. For to ſpeake more plainely to the purpoſe, we all in thoſe daies crept as it were in Cimmerian darkeneſſe, fearing and faring for all the world like to thoſe gueſts of <hi>Denis</hi> the tyrant of Sicilie, who whiles they crammed themſelves full with viands, more irkeſome and unpleaſant than any hunger whatſoever, quaked to ſee from the embowed roofes aloft of the rowmes wherein they ſat at meat, ſwords faſtened onely to horſe haires, &amp; hanging juſt over the napes of their neckes. Then it was alſo, that <hi>Baſsianus</hi> (by birth of a noble houſe, by calling a Notarie, and by his place ſerving in the warres with the formoſt, called into queſtion, as if he had gone about to fore-know high matters of State although himſelfe avouched, That he ſought onely whether his wife ſhould be delivered of a boy or girle? how ever he eſcaped death, through the great and earneſt ſuit of his friends that ſtucke cloſe unto him) was ſtripped out of a rich live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lode and inheritance that he had.

And by the meanes of him as an Oratour and advocate at the barre, <hi>Valens</hi> was taught and inſtructed before hand, what he ſhould place in the formoſt parts of his Oration, that he might thereby proceed and profit more eaſily, as alſo with what figurative devices he ſhould give the attempt upon brave and goodly places.</p>

There was a certaine dame of Smyrna, who before the Proconfull of Aſia, <hi>Dolabella</hi> confeſſed, That ſhe had by poyſon made away her ſonne and husband, for that ſhe knew by manifeſt proofe, that they had murdered a ſonne of hers by a former husband: and her tryall being adjourned for certaine dayes, when the Counſell and Court un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which, according to the cuſtom, ſhe was put off, ſtood perplexed and doubtfull what ſhould be ſet downe and determined, in this caſe, being of a midle nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a revenge and a wicked act, ſent ſhe was unto the <hi rend="sup">k</hi> Areopagites, thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Athenian Iudges, whoſe equitie, by report, had decided the debates of the gods. Theſe having duely heard and examined the cauſe, awarded, That the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man together with her accuſer, ſhould make apparance an hundred yeares after: leaſt they ſhould either acquit the woman of poyſoning, or puniſh her for reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the murder of her deere ſonne. So, That is never thought late, which of all things is the laſt. After theſe parts aforeſaid committed in ſundry ſorts of injuſtice, and markes imprinted ſhamefully upon the bodies of free perſons that ſurvived, the never-winking eye of Iuſtice, that judgeth and puniſheth at all times injuries, diligently watched. For, the Furies, revengers of thoſe that were thus ſlaine, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up with moſt juſt recitall of continuall complaints one in the necke of another, kindled the flames of <hi>Bellona,</hi> to the end that the truth of the Oracle might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, which foretold, That none of theſe foule acts thus perpetrated, ſhould paſſe unpuniſhed. Whiles theſe iniquities above related, during the ceſſation of the Parthian warres, are by inteſtine calamities ſpread abroad in Antioch, all the dreadfull ſort of infernall Furies, after manifold misfortunes which they had diſplayed and ſent abroad, departing from the ſame citie, ſetled upon the necke of all Aſia throughout in this manner. One <hi>Festinus</hi> of <note n="*" place="margin">Tridentinus.</note> Trent, a man of baſe and obſcure parentage, beloved of <hi>Maximinus</hi> as his companion, and taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bond (as it were) of brotherhood, and by the appoyntment and decree of the Deſtinies, went over into the Eaſt Empire: and there having governed Syria, and gone through the Office of Maſter of the <note n="*" place="margin">or Records.</note> Rolles, left behind him good examples of mildneſſe and honour: Whereupon, after he had begun to rule Aſia in place of a Proconſul, he ſet ſayle (as they ſay) gently forward, and
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:14644:184"/>
held on his courſe toward the port of glorie. And hearing that <hi>Maximinus</hi> wrought miſchiefe, and ſought the overthrow of the beſt men, hee reprooved o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhiles his doings, as pernitious and deteſtable. But when he underſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that the man without any deſert was come up to be Prefect, and all by the meanes of their funerals whom he had wickedly done to death, he alſo grew to have an hote deſire for to doe and hope the like: and ſo all on a ſodaine, like unto a player chaunging his part, and conceived with an ardent affection to doe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, he went ſtately with ſtaring and ſterne eyes, ſuppoſing yer it were long that a Prefectſhip would fall to him, in caſe he alſo had embrued himſelfe with the bloud of innocent perſons. And albeit there are many and ſundrie parts which he acted (that I may uſe a mild tearme) moſt rigorouſly, yet it ſhall ſuffice to recount a few of them that are notorious and commonly divulged, which were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him in imitation of thoſe examples that were ſhewed at Rome. For, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſame reaſon there is of things done well or ill, even there alſo, although haply for the greatneſſe thereof which is unlike, there be ſome defect in the compariſon. A certaine Philoſopher named <hi>Caeronius,</hi> a man of no ſmall deſert, he killed with exceſſive and moſt cruell torments (whoſe death remaineth unrevenged) for that in a familiar letter of his written unto his owne wife, hee put in the end this poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript in Greeke, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a proverbiall ſpeech commonly taken up, that when one heareth it, he may take the deeper knowledge and impreſſion, that ſome great matter is to be done. A ſimple and ſilly old woman there was, who uſed with a gentle charme to heale intermittant <note n="*" place="margin">as tertians, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, quotidians, and ſuch like.</note> agues, comming by fits, her hee put to death, after that ſhe had cured a daughter of his, notwithſtanding ſhe was ſent for with his owne privitie.

There was a yong man ſeene within the baine to lay the fingers of both hands upon a marble ſtone, and his breaſt, by turnes one after another, and therewith to have numbred and recited the ſeven <hi rend="sup">1</hi> vowels, taking this to be a good remedie for the paine of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, hereupon he was judicially convented, and after torture had his head ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten off by the ſword.</p>

Which, to be true, ſundrie evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences there be, and thoſe moſt certaine that doe teſtifie, of which it ſhall ſuffice to ſet downe a few. A well growne youth, one of theſe whom they tearme <note n="*" place="margin">Pages.</note> Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogianos, being appointed in a place, for the better marking of the hunters game, to hold a Spartane hound, chaunced to let him ſlip before the ſet time, for that the dogge whiles he ſtrived to be gone had aſſayled and bitten him: For which, he had by his commaundement the baſtinadoe, untill he dyed therewith, and was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the ſame day. The maſter of a certaine <hi rend="sup">1</hi> forge or worke-houſe, who had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto him a curace moſt workemanly poliſhed, and therefore looking for his reward, he commaunded to be killed, for nothing elſe but this, that the ſayd peece of yron armour was ſomewhat leſſe in weight than the patterne which he had given him. <hi>Constantianus</hi> the horſe-chooſer, becauſe he was ſo bold as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge ſome of thoſe horſes of ſervice, for the <hi rend="sup">m</hi> allowing of which he had beene ſent into Sardinia, by his commaundement alſo was ſtoned to death. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> a chariotier, and favourite then of his, whom he had in ſuſpition for ſome vulgar levitie, in ſo much as he gave commaundement he ſhould be burnt quicke, in caſe he attempted any ſuch thing; notwithſtanding that not long after hee had (by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) done him pleaſurable ſervice, without any pardon at all vouchſafed to this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall deviſer of his delights and ſports, was by precept from him conſumed to aſhes. <hi>Africanus,</hi> a well practiſed Advocate and defender of mens cauſes in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, after he had governed a Province, aſpired to the rule of another: unto whoſe friend and mediator <hi>Theodoſius</hi> captaine of the horſemen, who ſued in his behalfe for the ſaid preferment, he returned this churliſh and rude anſwer, <hi>Goe thy wayes Lieutenant</hi> (quoth he) <hi>and change his head, who deſireth thus to have his Province chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi> And by this warrant-parol the eloquent man loſt his life, whiles he haſtened to greater preferments, as many doe. A certaine fellow for his verie baſe condition contemptible, accuſed <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Sallustius,</hi> who from out of the band of the Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viani were advaunced to the dignitie of Tribunes: for that when <hi>Procopius</hi> ſought to be an Emperour, they had given out ſome good words in his behalfe. But when there could appear no matter of ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce againſt them, by any examinations upon the racke, the Prince never gave over to give the captaines of the horſemen, who had the hearing of their cauſe, in charge, That they ſhould baniſh <hi>Claudius,</hi> and pronounce ſentence of death upon <hi>Sallustius;</hi> promiſing therewith, That when he was had away, and haled to the place of execution, he would recall him backe againe.

For the ſaid lieutenant making haſt with all earneſt deſire to revenge his death, wrought many meanes, and thoſe very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, to the utter overthrow of the foreſaid privie murtherer. And as it was by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie rumors reported, great diligence and labour hereabout was employed in the Emperours palace. And verily, the relations made by <hi>Romanus,</hi> which caſt many and grievous imputations upon <hi>Firmus,</hi> were willingly entertained of the prince, and read before him, whiles there wanted not many beſides favourably to ſecond the ſame. But on the contrarie ſide, looke what <hi>Firmus</hi> impleaded, and oftentimes by his friends alledged in defence of himſelfe and of his life, the ſame, how ever it was received, did remaine a long time ſmothered, by reaſon that <hi>Remigius,</hi> maſter at that time of the Offices, allied by marriage, and a friend unto <hi>Romanus,</hi> conſtantly alwayes affirmed, That among many weightie and important affaires of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, theſe ſo frivolous and ſuperfluous matters ought not be read unto him, but at ſome convenient and ſeaſonable time. Which when the Moore perceived to be a practiſe for to overthrow his defence, trembling now for feare of extremitie, leaſt haply when thoſe allegations which he pretended and pleaded were caſt aſide, he
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:14644:186"/>
might be condemned as one pernitious and contumacious, and ſo put to death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his allegeance unto the Empire, and rebelled: and ſuch helpes . . . for feare leaſt by encreaſe of his power he might grow to be an implacable enemie, to the ſuppreſſing of him, with the helpe of ſome few ſouldiors attendant about the court, was <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> Generall of the Horſemen, ſent: whoſe vertues in thoſe dayes, as of great efficacie, above the reſt ſhone forth, being like for all the world to thoſe auncient knights <hi>Domitius Corbulo</hi> and <hi>Luſius,</hi> whereof the former under <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> the other under <hi>Traiane,</hi> Emperours of Rome, were renowmed for many vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant acts. Being departed therefore from <note n="*" place="margin">Arelate.</note> Arles with moſt luckie and fortunat Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpices, and having paſſed the ſea with that fleet whereof he had the conduct, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any rumour going before, hee arrived at the ſhore of Mauritania Sitifenſis, which the inhabitants call <note n="*" place="margin">Gigell.</note> Igilgitanum: and there finding by chaunce <hi>Romanus,</hi> and ſpeaking gently to him, he ſent him to ſet in order the centinels &amp; fore-guards, with little or no rebuke at all for thoſe things that he feared. Who being gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to [Mauritania] Caeſarienſis, he ſent <hi>Gildo</hi> the brother of <hi>Firmus,</hi> as alſo <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus,</hi> to reforme <hi>Vincentius;</hi> who whiles he was lieutenant of <hi>Romanus,</hi> became partaker of his uncivile behaviour and his thefts. When he had therefore received his ſouldiors, late though it were, who made the longer ſtay by reaſon of the maine and wide ſea, haſtening to Sitifis, he gave order, That <hi>Romanus</hi> with his domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call attendants ſhould be committed unto the ſafe cuſtodie of the <note n="*" place="margin">Guard. ſouldiors.</note> Protectores. And whiles he abode within the towne, diſtracted he was with doubtfull thoughts and cares, caſting and toſſing in his mind, by what way or by what device he might either through hot and ſcorched countries lead his ſouldiors, accuſtomed to froſts; or take the enemie priſoner, that uſed to make ſuddaine rodes, and truſted more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſecret ambuſhes than any ſet battailes. Which when it was knowne unto <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> firſt by running rumours, and afterwards by plaine and open intelligences gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſore affrighted at the comming of a moſt approoved and expert captaine, he confeſſed his error, and craved pardon of all that was paſt, both by Orators whom he ſent, and alſo by letters which he wrote; ſhewing and declaring, That he brake not forth of his owne accord to that fact which he knew to be wicked, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of unjuſt dealing, which grew to licentious outrage, as he promiſed by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to prove. Which miſſives being read, and pardon promiſed upon the receit of hoſtages, the captaine <note n="*" place="margin">Theodoſius.</note> aforeſaid went forward to take a review of the Legions which defended Africke, unto a ſtation named Panchariana, whither as to the <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez-vous</hi> by commaundement they were to repaire. There having with honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and wiſe ſpeeches confirmed all their hopes, he returned to Sitifis, and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the ſouldiors there inhabiting, together with thoſe whom he brought with him; and impatient of farther delayes, he made haſt to exploit ſome warlike ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Moreover, among many and notable parts of his beſide this one thing migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily encreaſed the love of the countrey unto him, in that he expreſſely forbad, That the provinciall inhabitants ſhould find the armie any victuals, giving out, and that with a brave &amp; confident ſpirit, That the harveſts and hoords of the enemies were the garners of our valorous men.</p>

From whence, when he had warily viewed and ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched all, as the time and place would give leave, he ſped himſelfe apace toward the nations of the Tyndenſes and Maſiniſſenes, furniſhed and well appointed with light armour, whom <hi>Maſcizel</hi> and . . . <hi>dius,</hi> brethren of <hi>Firmus,</hi> had the leading of. Now, when theſe enemies, nimble and deliver of lim, were within view, after diſcharge of ſhot and caſting-weapons on both ſides, there was ſtrucken a moſt ſharpe and cruell battaile; and among the grones, deaths, and wounds, was heard lamentable yelling and weeping of the barbarous people, taken priſoners and ſlaine: And when the fight was finiſhed, many of the territories were forrayed and fired: Among which the miſeries of the <note n="*" place="margin">or Borough.</note> Burgade Petrenſis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, as being utterly raſed and deſtroyed: which place the lord thereof <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> brother to <hi>Firmus,</hi> had built in manner of a citie. The conquerour lifted up with this good ſucceſſe, with wonderfull celeritie poſſeſſed himſelfe of the towne Lamforctenſe, ſituate among the nations aboveſaid: where he cauſed great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of victuals to be layed up, to the end, that if as he went more inward into the countrey, he ſhould find ſcarcitie of food, he might give order to have it fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched neere at hand. In theſe traine of affaires, <hi>Maſcizel</hi> having repaired his forces, with the aid-ſouldiors of the nations bordering upon him, joined battaile with our men, wherein after many of his part defeated, himſelfe through the ſwiftneſſe of his horſe with much adoe eſcaped the danger of death. <hi>Firmus</hi> wearied with the adverſe fortune of two battailes, and chafing at the very heart root, becauſe he would not omit the utmoſt meanes that were, ſent certaine Chriſtian biſhops with hoſtages, to treat for peace. Who, becauſe they were courteouſly entertained, and upon promiſe of victuals ſufficient for the ſouldiors, according as they had in charge, brought backe a joyfull anſwere, the Moore himſelfe ſending his preſents before him, very confidently went forth toward the Romane Generall, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon a courſer, meet for any doubtfull chaunces that might betide him. And when he drew neere, being ſtrucken amazed at the glittering enſignes, and the terrible countenance of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> he alighted from his horſe, and bowing downe his head, ſtouped almoſt to the very ground, and ſo with teares blamed his owne raſhneſſe, craving pardon and peace: who being received with a kiſſe (for it was thought behoofefull to the Commonwealth) and now full of good hopes, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed us with ſufficient food: and ſo leaving ſome of his owne kinsfolkes behind in lieu of the hoſtages, departed, with a purpoſe to redeliver the captives, as he promiſed, whom in the very beginning of the troubles he had caught up and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away: and within two dayes after, without any longer delay, he rendred back,

                  </note> Caeſarea, a wealthy and noble citie in times paſt, the originall whereof likewiſe we have fully ſhewed in the deſcription of Affricke.

The General therefore turning from hence came to a free borough towne named Sugabarritanum, ſeated upon the riſing of the mountaine Tranſcellenſis: where he found the horſemen of the fourth cohort of archers, which had revolted unto the rebell: and to ſhew that hee was content with ſome mild puniſhment, he thruſt them all downe to the loweſt degree of war ſervice: and both them and alſo part of the Conſtantian footmen, he commanded to come to Tigaviae with their Tribunes; one of whom had done upon the head of <hi>Firmus</hi> a chaine for a diademe.

Which being performed
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:14644:187"/>
according to appointment, himſelfe went forth at breake of day, and finding them in the armie encloſed round about, <hi>What thinke yee</hi> (quoth he) <hi>my devoted fellowe ſouldiors, ought to be done with theſe wicked traitours?</hi> and when they cryed all with one voyce and required, That they who ſerved among the <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Conſtantiani, ſhould looſe their life-bloud for it; he following their deſire delivered them, after the old manner, unto the ſouldiors to be maſſacred. As for the principall of the archers aforeſaid, he cut off their hands, the reſt he beheaded after the example of <hi>Curio,</hi> that moſt fierce &amp; valiant captain, who by this kind of puniſhment made an end of the Dardanians ſtoutneſſe, which after the manner of the <hi rend="sup">m</hi> Lernaean ſerpent other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles ſprung up new againe. But malicious backebiters, as they commend that auncient fact, ſo they condemne this, as curſed and over rigorous; ſaying, That the Dardanians were mortall enemies and juſtly deſerved thoſe puniſhments that they ſuſtained, whereas the ſouldiors ſerving under their colours, when they all happened to fall into one errour, ſhould have beene dealt with in a milder kind of correction: Whom, I knowing that I doe, anſwer and give to underſtand, That this cohort both by fact and example were rebellious. As touching <hi>Belles</hi> and <hi>Fericius</hi> aforeſaid, whom <hi>Gildo</hi> brought, as alſo <hi>Curandius,</hi> Tribune of the archers, he commaunded them to be killed in this regard, for that neither himſelfe in perſon would ever encounter with the enemies, nor exhort his ſouldiors under him to fight.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or theſe and the like glorious atchievements, this moſt noble captain ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great joy and contentment, with a puiſſant power ſought to be meet with the principall troubler himſelfe of peace: and therefore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his abode a long time neere to a fort named Medianum, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and politicke debatements of means projected, good hope he had that he might be betrayed unto him. But whiles with perplexed thoughts and deepe care he did forecaſt how to compaſſe this, he underſtood for truth, That the enemie was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again to the Iſaflenſes, whom without any farther delay, as before, he marched againſt with ſpeed. Vnto whom, their king named <hi>Igmazen,</hi> a prince in thoſe tracts of high reputation, and famous for his wealth, advancing forth and boldly affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him: <hi>Whence art thou</hi> (quoth he) <hi>and what buſineſſe haſt thou, that thou art hither come? Anſwere me.</hi> Vpon whom <hi>Theodoſius</hi> in a reſolute mind looking wiſtly with a ſterne countenance: <hi>A Lieutenant I am</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>unto</hi> Valentinian, <hi>Lord of the whole earth, ſent to ſubdue a bloudie and cruell robber: and unleſſe thou render him out of hand, according as the invincible Emperour hath determined, thou and the whole nation which thou ruleſt ſhall utterly periſh.</hi> Which when <hi>Igmazen</hi> heard, after many reviling taunts that he let flie againſt the Generall, much troubled with anger and griefe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he went his way. And the next morning betimes the armies on both ſides advanced forth in moſt menacing wiſe, readie to encounter and joyne battaile. On the Barbarians ſide there were 20000 very neere, marſhalled in the very front of the vantguard; behind whoſe backes were beſtowed ſecretly the ſquadrons of auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for ſupply; who riſing up by little and little, might ſhew themſelves, and with their multitude encloſe our men ere they were aware. Beſides theſe, there came in many of the Ieſalenes as aid-ſouldiors, who (as I ſhewed before) had promiſed our men helpe and proviſion of victuals. On the other ſide, the Romans, although they were very few, yet bearing valiant hearts, and lifted up with precedent victories, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet their flanks thicke thruſt together, &amp; fitted their ſhields cloſe one to another in manner of a fence-roufe, ſtood their ground and reſiſted. And when from the Sunne riſing unto the end of the day the fight had continued, <hi>Firmus</hi> a little before the evening was ſeene mounted upon a tall courſer, &amp; diſplaying forth a good way from him his red coat armor, with lowd cries to move and exhort our ſouldiors for to deliver up <hi>Theodoſius</hi> betimes (tearming him cruel, deteſtable, &amp; a bloudy deviſer of torments and executions) in caſe they were deſirous to be rid from the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they endured. Theſe words of his unlooked for, incited ſome of them more eagerly to fight, but inticed others to forſake the field. And therefore, ſo ſoone as the ſtill time of night was come, whiles both ſides were enwrapped within wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering darkneſſe, the Roman Generall returned to the fortreſſe Duodienſe, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a review and muſter of his ſouldiors, looke how many of them cowardly feare and the words beſide of <hi>Firmus</hi> had turned from their purpoſe of fighting, he puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:14644:189"/>
ſundry waies with death; ſome by cutting off their right hands, others by bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alive. And moſt carefully keeping watch &amp; ward, ſome of the Barbarians who adventured after the Moone was downe, when they could not be ſeene, to ſet upon our campe, he either diſcomfited, or elſe if they ruſhed in very audaciouſly, took the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> priſoners. After this, departing from thence a great pace, he courſed the Ieſalenes (as a people hardly to be truſted) through crooked lanes, where he was little looked for, and afflicted them ſo, as he brought them to extreame penurie: and being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the townes of Mauritania Caeſarienſis to Sitifis, after he had racked and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured even to death <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Martinianus,</hi> partakers with <hi>Romanus</hi> in all robberies and foule facts, he burnt them. After this, the warre began afreſh with the Iſaflenſes: and in the firſt conflict, when many of the Barbarians were beaten backe and ſlaine, <hi>Igmazen</hi> their king (who heretofore was wont ever to be a winner) diſtracted &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with this preſent diſtreſſe, and ſuppoſing that if he ſhould beare himſelfe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately ſtill, when commerce and traffique were once prohibited, there remained for him no hope at all to live, as warily &amp; cloſely as poſſibly could be out of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile he brake foorth alone, and eſpying <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> humbly beſought him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund <hi>Maſilla,</hi> a chiefe Peere of the Mazices, to come unto him. By whom, being ſent at his requeſt, in ſecret conferences he adviſed the Generall, who of his owne diſpoſition was no ſtarter, but conſtant and reſolute, That to give him means wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might bring more eaſily his purpoſe about, he would preaſſe hotly upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe of his owne nation, &amp; by continuance of fight turne them to feare, who verily were readie ynough to affect and favour the Rebell, but wearied out with many loſſes. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> gave eare &amp; condiſcended to his words, &amp; with often skirmiſhing foyled the Iſaflenſes ſo, that whiles they fell downe like ſo many beaſts, <hi>Firmus</hi> privily ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped aſide, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had bin confined a long time within ſtarting holes out of the way, whiles he conſulted there how to flie and eſcape, was ſtaied &amp; kept in ward by <hi>Igmazen.</hi> And for as much as he was informed, what had bin underhand &amp; ſecretly practiſed by <hi>Maſilla,</hi> ſeeing now in this extremitie &amp; deſpaire of his eſtate, there was no remedie left but one, he determined by a voluntarie death to tread under foot all deſire of life: and being for the nonce full of wine, till his skin ſtrutted againe, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe lay awake for terror of the miſerie hanging over his head, whiles the warders having their load likewiſe of headie wine, lay ſound aſleepe in the dead time of the night. Then leaving his bed, and creeping on all foure without making any noiſe, he ſevered himſelfe apart farre off, and having found a cord, which to end his life hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be readie for his hand, he hung it upon a nayle or ſpike that ſtucke in the wall, and ſo knitting his necke within it, without any lingering torments ended his life. Which accident <hi>Igmazen</hi> taking grievouſly, and groning againe, that he was diſappointed of his glory, in that it was not his good hap to lead this rebellious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in bonds to the Romane campe, after aſſurance made of ſafe conduct by the meanes of <hi>Maſilla,</hi> himſelfe carrying the dead bodie of him thus murthered, upon a Camell, when he approched the tents of the armie, pitched under the ſort Subica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renſe, he ſhifted it upon a packe-horſe, and preſented it unto <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who joyed &amp; triumphed thereat. And calling together as well the armed ſouldiors as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, he asked, Whether they knew that viſage? and when without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay or circumſtance made, he underſtood certainely it was his face, after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there a little while, he returned to Sitifis in triumphant manner, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſolemnly with the favour of all ſorts of age and degree.</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his feare being ſomewhat allayed, he tooke a good heart and courageouſly ſet in hand with ſuch matters as were urgent and needfull; hee ſcoured the ditches that were choked up and filled with rammell; and, as he was inured in an humor of building, he quickly brought up the greateſt part of the wals (which through long peace lay neglected and ſubverted) as farre as to the battlements of high towers.

Certaine perſons there were, having ſhrewd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie wits of their owne, fed and maintained many times with the loſſes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale, who before <hi>Valens</hi> complotted and packed againſt <hi>Para,</hi> being as yet but a young Prince, divers imputations, aggravating the ſame in the worſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Among whom was <hi>Terentius</hi> Lord Warden of the Marches, one that walked lowly, and alwayes ſomewhat heavie and ſad, but ſo long as he lived a perillous ſower and ſtirrer up of diſſentions. Who having taken into his ſocietie ſome few people, ſuch as for their lewd and hainous offences ſtood in doubtfull tearmes of feare, by writing to the Emperours Court and Counſell, ceaſed not to reiterate the death of <hi>Cylaces</hi> and <hi>Artabanes:</hi> adding moreover, That the ſaid young Prince, reaching and ayming at proud deeds, became exceeding hard and cruel to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Whereupon the ſaid <hi>Para,</hi> under a colour, as if he ſhould be made partaker of a treatie then to be holden, as the inſtant affaires required, called after a roial ſort, and under a pretenſe of ſerviceable courteſie attended at Tarſus in Cilicia, when as he neither could be admitted into the Emperours campe, nor yet know the cauſe of this urgent apparance of his, for that everie man held his tongue, at the length
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:14644:192"/>
by a ſecret inkling given unto him, he found, that <hi>Terentius</hi> by his letters adviſed the Roman Emperour, to ſend ſtraightwayes another to be king of Armenia, leaſt in hatred of <hi>Para,</hi> and for feare that he ſhould returne, the whole nation, of ſuch importance to us, ſhould revolt and become ſubject unto the Perſians, who were hot upon the getting of it either by force, or feare, or flatterie. Which when he the ſaid king revolved in his mind, he preſaged that ſome grievous miſchiefe hung over his head. And being now ware of this deceitfull plot, and finding no other meanes to ſave himſelfe but by a ſpeedie departure, at the perſuaſion of ſuch as he had affiance in, he having gathered about him three hundred of his traine, who had followed him forth of his <note n="*" place="margin">Armenia.</note> countrey, upon moſt ſwift horſes, when the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the day was ſpent, more adventurous than adviſed (as commonly it is ſeene in great and daungerous frights) he went forth in manner of a pointed bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailon, and haſtened away feareleſſe. And when an officer belonging to <hi rend="sup">a</hi> the <note n="*" place="margin">Corrector, or Governor.</note> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator of the Province, who warded the gate, much troubled to ſee him make ſuch haſt, found him in the ſuburbes and quarters neere unto the citie, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him verie earneſtly to ſtay; and ſeeing he could not prevaile, turned backe for feare of being killed. In like manner a little after, the legion alſo that purſued, and now approached neere unto him, himſelfe together with the forwardeſt of his companie galloping backe, and ſhooting arrowes that flew as thicke as ſparkes of fire, but miſſing them for the nonce, put to flight, ſo that all our ſouldiors toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their Tribune terrified, retyred backe againe to the walls more luſtily than they came forward. Then freed from all feare, after he had for two dayes and two nights together endured the painefull labour of journeyes, when he was come to Euphrates, and for want of ſhips could not at any foord paſſe over the river, full of gulfes and whirlepite, as a number of them not skilfull in ſwimming were afraid, ſo himſelfe moſt of them all held off and adventured not. And verily remained he had behind, but that (as everie man caſt about ſundrie ſhifts) he was able to find out this meanes of evaſion, which at the verie point of neceſſitie was moſt ſafe. Such little beds as they found in the villages, they ſupported with two leather bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles or budgets apeece, whereof there was good ſtore neere at hand in the fields where wine was made. Vpon everie one of which, a chiefe peere and the Prince himſelfe ſitting ſeverally, to wing and haling after them their horſes, by winding paſſages that they made, declined the high waves and billowes of the water, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging full againſt them. And by this device, at length after extreame perils, came to the banke on the farther ſide. All the reſt riding upon their horſes that ſwum, and oftentimes by reaſon of the ſtreame daſhing round about them, dowſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the water, and toſſed to and fro, after they had beene weakned with this daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous wet that they tooke, were caſt upon the bankes againſt them: where after they had refreſhed themſelves a little while, they marched more ſpeedily lightly appointed than they did the dayes paſt. When the Emperour heard newes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, much troubled at the flight and eſcape of the foreſaid <hi>Para,</hi> who he thought now being out of the ſnare, and at libertie, would breake his allegeance, he ſent out <hi>Danieles</hi> and <hi>Barzimeres</hi> with a thouſand light and nimble Carbines, for to fetch him backe, the one a Lieutenant, and the other a Tribune of the Scutarij. Theſe truſting upon their owne perfect knowledge of the wayes, for that he haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away as he did, like a ſtranger and one unacquainted with the countrey, made many winding turnes and fetched a compaſſe, prevented his journeyes, going the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:14644:192"/>
next way through the vallyes: and having parted betweene them their forces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet the two next paſſages, which were three miles a ſunder, that as he ſhould paſſe by either of them, he might be intercepted yer he was aware. But this device and project of theirs came to nothing, by ſuch an accident as this. A certaine way-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring man making haſt on his journey, to a place on this ſide, eſpying the hill full of armed men, for to avoid them, going aſide by a croſſe backe lane in the middle, chanced upon the Armenians all wearied: and being brought unto the king, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth him in ſecret talke alone what he had ſeene, and ſo without any harme done unto him was there detained. And ſoone after, without any ſemblance or ſhew made of feare, there was ſent out an horſeman ſecretly to the right ſide of the way, to provide lodging and victuals: When he was gone a little forward, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther likewiſe had commaundement to goe moſt ſpeedily to the left tract for to doe the like, who knew not that the other was ſent another way. Theſe things thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to a good purpoſe, the king himſelfe with his followers returning backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with the way-faring perſon himſelfe that ſhewed him the way through the buſhes by a rough beaten path, and little ynough for an horſe laden to paſſe, gat away and left our ſouldiors behind his backe: who having caught his miniſters ſent out to caſt a miſt (as it were) before their minds that wayted for him, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in manner with hands reached forth to catch an hunters prey. And whiles they looke ſtill for him when he would come, he having in ſafetie recovered his kingdome, and with exceeding joy of his people being received, continued firme and faſt in the ſame true and aſſured loyaltie, putting up with ſilence all the wrongs that he had ſuſtained.</p>

would give even to honourable perſonages, they have divers times beene condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, And of theſe there be ſome ſo rude, that they cannot remember they were ever maſters of any law bookes. And if at any aſſembly or meeting of learned men, there happen to be mention made of ſome auncient author, they ſuppoſe it to be ſome forraine name of a fiſh or diſh of meat.

Now, when as there have ſo many dayes, monethes, and yeares gone over the parties heads that are in ſuit, that they become ſtript bare of their money, at length when as the matter in controverſie is growne ſtale and throughly worne in continuance of time, then are the verie principall heads and great doctors admitted and let in: who being entred bring in with them other dumbe ſhewes of Advocates. And when they are come within the encloſure of the barre or raile, and the whole eſtate or life of ſome man begins to come in queſtion and tryall, what time as all endevour ſhould be uſed to keepe either the edge of the ſword from an innocent, or put by loſſe from a poore and miſerable perſon, with frowning foreheads on both ſides, and armes compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed after the geſture of actors on a ſtage (ſo that there ſeemeth nought wanting but <hi>Gracchus</hi> his <hi rend="sup">h</hi> pipe behind their backes, by which he was woont in his orations to temper his voice) they ſtand ſtil along time on either hand: And at laſt, out of ſome premeditate flouriſh, there comes forth by him who is the bolder of the twaine and more confident of ſpeech, ſome pleaſant and delightſome exordium or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſpeech, promiſing as it were the Rhetoricall ornaments, reſembling thoſe of the famous orations pronounced either for <hi>Cluentius</hi> or <hi>Cteſiphon:</hi> and when all that heare it are deſirous to have an end made, the matter groweth to this concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at length, that the patrons (for ſooth) after a ſhew made of a three yeares ſuit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending in the court, alledge for excuſe, that they be not yet ſufficiently inſtructed and prepared: and ſo when they have obtained a longer time ſtill of adjournment, as if they had alreadie wreſtled hard with that old <hi>Antaeus,</hi> they ceaſe not to call ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for their fees, in regard of this their daungerous conflict and doubtfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat performed.

For, being fleſhed with the baits of idle gaines comming in with ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtill, and doing little or nought, they are at daggers drawing among themſelves; and breaking forth into a malapert humor of railing, as hath been ſaid, they offend and diſpleaſe many: Which bitter humor of theirs then doe they diſcharge and raſhly diſgorge, when as they are not able with all their ſtout ſpeeches and orations to cover and protect the weakeneſſe of their cauſes.

In the end, ſuch were the grievous burdens of tributes and the exactions of cuſtomes and impoſts ſo much enhanced and multiplied, that ſome of the peeres and nobles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted with the feare of extremitie, were forced to change their habitations &amp; void the countrey: yea, and certaine perſons there were, ſo overlayed with the rigorous and bitter dealing of under officers and miniſters, calling ſtill for more, that when they had not for to give them, they became perpetuall tenants of priſons: of whom there were ſome, who being now wearie of their lives, and not deſirous to ſee the light of this world any longer, ended their daies by the wiſhed for remedies of han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging themſelves.

And when he underſtood, that one periſhed with an halter, another was fled beyond ſea, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother killed himſelfe, or loſt his life with plumbets of lead, he grew into an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding paſſion of indignation: and evermore his wroth was fed by <hi>Leo,</hi> then maſter of the offices (ô ſhamefull villany) who himſelf alſo, in caſe the other, now aloft, ſhould once fall downe from the rocke, was readie to ſtep into his Praefectſhip: which if he had gotten and managed, ſurely the government of <hi>Probus</hi> had bin extolled up into heaven, in compariſon of thoſe parts which he would have played.</p>

Likewiſe at Sabaria, whiles himſelfe as yet there remained, an Owle ſitting upon the top of the kings Baines, and ſinging out in a dolefull note, could by no expert hand of thoſe that ſhot arrowes and flung ſtones, be made to fall, albeit they layd hard at her, ſtriving a vie, who ſhould do the feat. Semblably, when from the citie afore ſide he marched to give battell, he would needs goe forth at the ſame gate by which he entred in, to the end that he might ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome good pręſage of his ſpeedie returne backe againe into Gaule: alſo, when the place that lay forelet and neglected with heapes of rammell therein, was ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and made cleane, an yron dore happened to fall downe, which made up faſt the paſſage out of it; and a multitude of people laying all their power and ſtrength thereto, was not able to remove it: and ſo while he ſpent a day thereabout in vain, upon conſtraint he was faine to goe out at another gate. And that very night which went next before the day that ſhould bereave him of his life, he ſaw (as men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly doe in their ſleepe) his wife, being abſent, ſitting with her haire looſe about her eares, and clad in poore and mournefull array: which was imagined and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be his owne fortune, now readie to depart from him in foule attire and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite. As he was ſetting forward from thence in the morning betimes, ſomewhat ſad and with a frowning countenance, when the horſe which was brought unto him, would not ſuffer him to get on his backe, but contrarie to his manner roſe up with his forefeet aloft, his inbred crueltie was ſoone up, and (as he was by nature fell) he commaunded the right hand of the ſouldior, that was yeoman of the Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop, to be cut off which had put him beſide, as he was readie to mount his accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med beaſt; and died for it in dolorous manner had the innocent young man, but that <hi>Cerealis,</hi> Tribune of the Stable, with the danger of himſelfe, put off and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo curſed an act. After this came the embaſſadours of the Quadi, in humble wiſe requeſting pardon, with the finall aboliſhing of all that was paſt: which that they might obtaine without any barre or impeachment, they promiſed both their young trained ſouldiors, and ſome behoofefull things alſo for the Romane State. Whom, becauſe it was thought good to receive and entertaine, yea, and to ſuffer for to returne, with graunt of truce which they required (for, any longer to trouble and moleſt them, neither want of victuals, nor the adverſe time of the yeare would permit) they were conducted by <hi>Equitius,</hi> and admitted into the Conſiſtorie. And when enfeebled for feare and daunted, they ſtood with their bodies bowing and ſtouping forward, after they were commaunded to deliver their errand, they aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red conſtantly thoſe uſuall and ordinarie ſhewes of excuſes, and bound the ſame alſo with an oath, proteſting. That no treſpaſſe had beene committed againſt our part by common conſent or counſell of the nobles of the land, but looke what had beene rudely and uncivilely done, the ſame happened by the meanes of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine out-lying robbers in the borders, and confining upon the river. This more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they added, avowing the ſame to be a ſufficient reaſon to aſſoyle them of all that was done, in that the fort which was begun and going up neither juſtly nor conveniently, did ſet the hearts of the ruſticall and wild peaſants on fire, and made them ſo fierce and ſtout as they were.

Where being laid upon a bed drawing yet ſome ſmall remaines of vitall breath, without any empairing at all of his intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall facultie and power, he knew all that ſtood by him, ſuch as his chamberlaines had with great celeritie gotten together about him, leaſt any man might ſuſpect that he had beene ſecretly murdered. And for as much as by reaſon of the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive heat of the midriffe that knit his bowels together, there was of neceſſitie a veine to be opened, there was not a Phyſitian or Chirurgian to be had, upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he had ſent them all ſundrie wayes ſcattering abroad to cure the ſouldiors which lay ſicke of the peſtilence: yet was there one found, who notwithſtanding that he had pricked his veine once or twice, yea and oftner too, could not draw forth ſo much as one drop of bloud, ſo ſcorched were his inward parts with exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive heat: or as ſome thought, for that his bodie was dryed up, by reaſon that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine paſſages therein, which now we tearme <hi rend="sup">i</hi> Haemorrhoides, were cloſed up and growne to a verie hard cruſt, they were ſo bound up with cold. Well, ſuch was the violent and infinit rage of his diſeaſe, that he perceived the preſcript houre of his death was now come, and as he aſſaied to ſpeake ſomewhat, and give ſomething in charge, as the yex that often ſhooke his flankes and ſmall guts, the gnaſhing of his teeth, and the moving of his armes, laying about him as if they had beene figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at hurlebats, plainely ſhewed, being now overcome and ſpeckled here and there with <hi rend="sup">k</hi> wan and blew ſpots, he yeelded up his ghoſt, after it had long ſtrugled for life, in the five and fiftieth yeare of his age, and when he had raigned 12 yeares lacking 100 dayes.</p>

In regard of whoſe deſerts, <hi>Valentinian</hi> [his ſonne] from the verie prime of his youth commendable, with the helpe alſo of a long traine of his owne vertues, being adorned at Nicea with the inveſture of Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Majeſtie, tooke his brother <hi>Valens</hi> unto him as fellow Emperour: who in reſpect of brotherhood in the whole bloud, ſorted and accorded moſt joyntly with him; a <note n="*" place="margin">Valens.</note> man that carried himſelfe in a meane betweene reproachfull and prayſe-worthie acts, which I will in convenient place declare.
<hi>Valentinian</hi> therefore after many dangerous troubles paſt, whiles he led a privat life, was no ſooner entred upon his Empire, but he viſited the caſtles ſcituat neere unto great rivers &amp; violent ſtreames, as alſo Gaule, that lay expoſed to the Alemans rodes and invaſions, who began the more boldly to revive and ſtirre againe, upon knowledge of the Emperour <hi>Iulians</hi> death, whom onely of all the men in the world they ſtood in awe of. And for this good cauſe alſo was <hi>Valentinian</hi> much dread, becauſe he both reenforced his armies with ſtrong ſupplies, and alſo fortified Rhene on either ſide with high caſtles and fortreſſes, that the enemie making rodes &amp; breaking out upon our province, might no where be undiſcovered.

And in like manner the Britaines, who were not able to endure ſuch troupes of enemies overrunning them, he reſtored to their libertie and quiet peace, with hope of better dayes, ſuffering not one in manner, of the foreſaid brigands to returne home into their countrey. With ſemblable valour, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunat ſucceſſe whereas one <hi>Valentinus,</hi> a baniſhed perſon in Pannonia, went about in theſe provinces to trouble the common peace, he ſuppreſſed him, before his plotted deſigne grew to any ſtrong head.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Equiſit it is after all this to come unto his deeds, which to men of a right judgement are to be followed and approved; wherewith if he could have tempered the reſt of his doings, he had lived like unto <hi>Traianus</hi> and <hi>Marcus.</hi> Very reſpective he was in ſparing the provinciall tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, mitigating in all places the heavie burthens of their tributes: a founder in good and convenient time of townes and limits: a ſingular Cenſor of militarie diſcipline; erring onely in this point, That whereas he puniſhed the light eſcapes and delinquencies of the common ſouldiors, he ſuffered the foule faults of great captaines and leaders to grow to a mightie head; divers times giving no eare, but thicke of hearing, when complaints were made againſt them: whence it was, that the troubles in Britannie, the loſſes in Affrick, and the waſting of Illyricum, aroſe. His bodie he kept cleane and chaſt every way both at home and abroad, diſtained and defiled with the contagion or privitie of no foule and filthie demeanour; no wantonneſſe or uncleane behaviour was he acquainted with: and for this cauſe, as it were, with reines and bitts he bridled the looſe wantonneſſe of the court, for that he could eaſily keepe himſelfe chaſt. Nothing paſſed he by graunt unto his neere friends or deere kinsfolke, whom he either kept under in private eſtate, or elſe meanely advaunced to honours, unleſſe it were his owne brother, whom he tooke to him (compelled thereto by the ſtreight neceſſitie of the time) as parte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his imperiall greatneſſe. Very preciſe and ſcrupulous he was in beſtowing of high offices and dignities: neyther during his raigne was there any banker
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:14644:201"/>
that had the rule of a province, nor any office ſold under him, but at the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie into his Empire; as commonly ſome lewd parts are wont to be committed, in hope of being unknowne through the buſineſſe of the time, or elſe of eſcaping with impunitie. In making of warres both offenſive or defenſive, moſt politicke and warie he was, hardened with the laborious practiſe of martiall toyle: a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing wiſe adviſer to goodneſſe, and as prudent a diſſuader from badneſſe: moſt curious and exquiſite in marſhalling and embattailing his armie: he wrote a faire hand: he painted and caſt counterfeits right properly and with a fine grace: he deviſed alſo new kinds of armour and weapons: a good memorie he had: and for his ſpeech, readie he was ynough in quicke deliverance; but ſildome came his utterance neere unto pleaſant eloquence. He loved to have all things neat and trim; taking delight not ſo much in ſumptuous and laviſh fare, as in fine and dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie diet. Finally, for this moderate carriage of himſelfe during his Empire he was much renowmed; and namely, in that among ſundrie ſorts of religion he ſtood as one indifferent: neither troubled he any man for his conſcience, nor commended either this or that to be obſerved and kept: ne yet with menacing edicts and injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions forced he his ſubjects to bow necke and ſtoupe unto that which himſelfe worſhipped, but left theſe points as cleere and untouched as he found them. His bodie was well brawned, muſculous &amp; ſtrong, the haire of his head ſhining bright, the colour of his complection cleere and faire: he had with his gray eyes a skew caſt at all times, and looked ſterne. The goodly preſence of his ſtature, together with a due knitting and proportionable making of his bodily lineaments, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed the full beautie of a royall majeſtie. Well, after the complements and laſt obſequies performed of this Emperour, and his corpes beſtowed in a coffin readie for ſepulture, that being ſent unto Conſtantinople, it might be enterred among the reliques of other Emperours of ſacred memorie, by reaſon of the inſtant warre depending, feared it was, what doubtfull and dangerous event thereof would be, by reaſon of the cohorts ſerving in Gaule: which being not alwayes devoted to yeeld allegeance unto lawfull princes, as if they were to make and chuſe Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors at their pleaſure, were feared, leaſt they would when time ſerved attempt ſome innovation: and this was no ſmall helpe to ſuch as aimed at an alteration, that <hi>Gratianus</hi> as yet ignorant of that which happened, abode then at Triers, where his father, when he went foorth in his expedition, appointed him to remaine. Things ſtanding thus upon theſe tickliſh and ſtreight tearmes, and when all thoſe who being, as it were, embarked in one ſhippe, were like to take part of the ſame dangers, if aught ſhould happen, and feared the ſame troubles, by counſell of the principall officers of State thought good it was and reſolved upon, That having plucked the bridge in pieces, which upon neceſſitie had beene framed and ſet together before, when invaſion was made into the enemies land, <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baudes</hi> by warrant from <hi>Valentinian,</hi> as then living, ſhould immediately bee ſent for: and he (as he was a man of quicke note and conceit) ſuppoſing that indeed which happened, or inſtructed peradventure by him who was ſent to call him, and ſuſpecting that the ſouldiors in Gaule would breake the lawes of concord and unitie, fained, that there was a warning word and privie token ſent, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne with him, for guarding and looking to the bankes of Rhene, as if the furious rage of the barbarous enemies were broken out afreſh: And as hee had with advice ſecretly given him in charge, hee ſent farre out of the way

                  <hi>Sebastian,</hi> who as yet knew not of the Emperours deceaſe; who verily was a quiet and peaceable man, howbeit borne up aloft with the favour of the ſouldiors; in which regard at that time eſpecially to be dread. When <hi>Merobaudes</hi> therefore was returned, with deepe forecaſt and providence propounded it was in counſell, That young <hi>Valentinian,</hi> the ſonne of the Emperour late departed, a child then of foure yeres old, ſhould be ſent for and called to aſſume the imperiall diademe, who then was an hundred myles of, and remained with his mother <hi>Iustina</hi> in a certaine vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage called <note n="*" place="margin">Muets. <hi>Ortel.</hi> who calleth it a citie.</note> Murocincta.

Thus the ſixt day after his fathers death he was lawfully proclaimed Emperour, and in ſolemne manner ſtyled <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus.</hi> And albeit whiles theſe things were thus in contriving, men thought that <hi>Gratianus</hi> would take it to the heart, That without his permiſſion there ſhould be ſet up another Emperour, yet afterwards, when the feare and care was paſt, they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in more ſecuritie: for that he, a prince both kind and politicke alſo, loved his <note n="*" place="margin">halfe brother, to wit, by the fathers ſide.</note> brother exceeding well, and brought him up in all tender affection.</p>

The nation of the Hunnes, little or nothing knowne by any auncient records, ſeated along the frozen ſea, beyond the mariſhes of Maeotis, exceedeth in felneſſe and crueltie beyond all meaſure: where (for that their infants cheekes from their very nativitie are deepely gaſhed with a knife, that by reaſon of the rivelled and wrinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled skarres, the yong haire, when it ſhould bud forth in due ſeaſon, might be chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and kept downe) they grow untill they be old all of them beardleſſe, without any favour or beautie at all, like unto guelded Eunuches. Generally, their lims be well knit and ſtrong, and by reaſon of their fat chuffe-necks they are monſtrouſly deformed and <note n="*" place="margin">hog-backs.</note> bending in the backe, that a man would take them for two footed brute beaſts; or elſe reſembling thoſe image-like poſts, which in the borders and

ſides of bridges, are ill favouredly hewed and ſhaped in forme of men. Sembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in their manner of life, they ſeeme to be ſo rude and rough, that they need neither fire nor ſavourie and ſeaſoned meats, but feed upon the rootes of weeds, and the fleſh of any cattell halfe raw, which being thruſt betweene their owne thighes and their horſes backes, they keepe warme, and give a ſhort heat unto. Never come they under any roofe, but all houſes they no leſſe decline than if they were ſepulchres ſtanding out of the way and apart from any common uſe; for there cannot be found among them ſo much as a cottage thatched over head with reed. But raunging here and there over the mountaines and the woods, they are enured from their verie cradle to endure both hunger and thirſt. When they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel abroad into other countries they come into no houſe but upon exceeding great neceſſitie: For they do not thinke themſelves ſecured and ſafe under any roofe. They are clad all over in garments made of linnen, or elſe patched up of wild <hi rend="sup">b</hi> mice skinnes: neither weare they one kind of apparell at home, and another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; but come there once over their head a coat of ſome over-worne colour, it never goes off nor is chaunged, before that with long wearing it be over-rotten and run to ragges and tatters. They cover their heads with hats ſhooting out and bending forward; and goats skinnes ſerve for ſtockings and hoſe to cover their hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie legges: And their ſhooes not made fit by any laſt, hinder them for ſetting their feet forward at libertie, and going at eaſe. For which cauſe they are not well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for ſervice on foot in the warres: but being locked faſt (as it were) to their horſebackes, which are tough and hard (I muſt needs ſay) but yet miſhaped and ill favoured; and otherwhiles ſitting upon them ſidelong as women do, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and performe their ordinarie buſineſſes. The faſhion is throughout this nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for everie one ſitting ſtill on horſebacke, all night and all day long to buy and ſell, to eat and drinke, yea and leaning forward and couching himſelfe upon the narrow necke of his horſe, to fall ſound aſleepe untill he have had a ſort of ſundrie dreames. And in this manner alſo ſit they all in counſell together, conſulting deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratly upon ſerious affaires propoſed. Now, directed they are by no regall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, but contenting themſelves with the tumultuarie conduct and leading of their principall Potentates, breake through they do whatſoever ſtands in their way. Sometime alſo they maintaine defenſive warre, and fight when they be provoked, but they begin battaile by plumps and companies one after another, ſetting up di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers noyſes, ſounding after an hideous manner. And as they are for quicke diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of ſervice verie light, and doing all of a ſodaine, ſo alſo as ſodainely for the nonce they diſperſe themſelves and fall a wailing; and then when the battell char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth full upon them, they ride all abroad, with committing much ſlaughter: and ſo neither entring upon the rampier and trench, nor rifling their enemies tents, for the moſt part they decide the quarell. And in this reſpect a man may well ſay, they fight like moſt ſharpe and eagre warriours: for that a farre off with caſting wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, with ſharpe poynted bones in ſtead of heads, and thoſe faſtened and fitted with wonderfull cunning, but neere at hand laid here and there with yron . . . . . . . . and whiles their enemies ward and obſerve the miſchievous venues of their pointed weapons, they entangle and bind them faſt within cords that they fling from them, to the end that when their limmes as they make reſiſtance be thus enſnared, they might bereave them of all power either to ride or goe. There is not one among them that eareth the ground, or at any time layeth hand to the plough tayle: For all of them, without any ſet habitation, without houſe or home, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

law or ſetled order wander here and there, like alwayes to thoſe that are in flight, together with their wagons in which they dwell. Wherein alſo the wives weare garments of hairie wooll, and lye with their husbands. Aske any among them, Where he was borne, there is not one of them can directly anſwer, as being in one place <note n="*" place="margin">or conceived.</note> begotten, borne in another farre off, and brought up yet farther. In truce-time treacherous and unfaithfull, inconſtant, upon everie gale of rumor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to riſe, and upon new hopes paſſing mutable; in one word, putting all upon the iſſue of moſt violent furie: Like unto inconſiderat and unreaſonable creatures, utterly ignorant of what is honeſt or unhoneſt: doubtfull, double, and darke in their ſpeeches. Awed at no time with reverent regard either of religion or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition: burning exceedingly in greedie deſire of gold. So variable and prone to anger, that in one and the ſame day, at ſeverall howers they will many times revolt from their allyes, without any quarell and provocation; and in like ſort be pleaſed, reconciled, and become friends againe without the mediation of any to mitigate their mood. This kind of men ſo quicke and nimble, ſo untamed and unreclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, burning in monſtrous deſire to rob and ſpoyle forrainers, after they had by ſpoyle and ſlaughter of the neighbour inhabitants made foule worke and havock, went on as farre as to Achaia.</p>

Beyond them are the Vidini and Geloni, verie fierce and ſavage nations: theſe uſe to flea off the skinnes of thoſe enemies whom they have ſlaine, and thereof make for themſelves garments, and for their horſes capariſons: a warlike people I aſſure you. Confining with the Geloni are the Agathyrſi, the skinne of whoſe bodies, alſo their haire, is ſpeckled all over with blew coloured ſpots. And verily the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſort have markes of that kind, ſmall and ſtanding here and there thin: but the noble men and gentrie, broader, with a colour ſet upon them, and thicker one by another. Next beyond theſe, we have heard that the Melanchlaenae and Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pophagi dwell ſcattering in divers places: theſe uſe to live by eating the fleſh of men and womens bodies, whom all the borderers forſooke for this abhominable

feeding, and went farre from them into the remote parts of the land. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole tract that lyeth North-eaſt untill you come unto the Seres, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inhabitable. In another quarter neere unto the place where the Amazons are ſeated, dwell the Alani mounting Eaſt-ward, and thoſe be ſpred into mightie and great nations, bending and bearing toward the tracts of Aſia: which people (as I have heard) ſtretch out in breadth as farre as to <note n="*" place="margin">Ganga, <hi>Caſtald.</hi> Cantan, <hi>Mereat.</hi> Gualgas, <hi>Thovet.</hi>

                  </gap>me and huge cantons, yet in proceſſe of time they grew into one name, and generally they be all tearmed Alani. In their manners, cuſtome and meanes of ſavage living they be in manner all one. For they have no cottages at all, nor any care to handle the plough, but live of fleſh and plentie of milke, ſitting upon <note n="*" place="margin">or carts.</note> waines, which being made of the bended covers of barkes they carrie with them along the deſert wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, that holdeth on ſtill without end. And when they are come to any places of greene graſſe, placing their carres in a round forme, they fall to their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, and feed as wild beaſts doe: Now when their food and forrage is ſpent, they carry (as one wold ſay) whole cities upon thoſe carts: and above in them their males and females engender together: in theſe are borne their infants, in theſe they have their breeding and education. Theſe and no other have they for their habitations continually, and whither ſoever they goe, there they take to be their native dwelling and homeſtall. As they drive their heards and flocks before them, they let them have their paſturage; but eſpecially of their horſes they have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie care. The fields there be evermore greene and full of graſſe, with places here and there betweene ſet thicke with trees bearing apples and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruit: and therefore what way ſoever they goe, they are at no default either for food or fodder: the reaſon hereof is the moiſt ground, and the courſes of many rivers running hard by. All thoſe therefore that for age or ſex be not ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the warres, keepe about the verie wagons or carts aforeſaid, and are buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in eaſie kind of worke: but the luſtie youth, that have growne up from their verie childhood in the practiſe of riding, thinke it a baſe thing to goe on foot: and they be all for militarie knowledge expert and politique warriours. Whereupon the Perſians alſo, who by their firſt originall are Scythians, be moſt skilfull ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. Now the Alani in manner all be tall of ſtature, and faire of complexion, their haire meetly yellow, with the caſt of their eyes, that yeeld a temperat ſterne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, terrible, and by reaſon of their light armour ſwift and nimble. Equall and ſutable to the Hunnes in all reſpects, ſave that in their feeding and apparell more civile they be than they . . . . . . . in ſwimming and hunting, raunging over the countries as farre as to the meeres of Maeotis, the Cimmerian Boſphorus, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia likewiſe and Media. And like as quiet and peaceable men take pleaſure in reſt and eaſe, ſo delight they in daungers and warres. Happie is that man repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there, who in battaile hath loſt his life: For ſuch as dye by age and other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall death, they revile and reproach with bitter taunts, as baſe and cowardly. Neither is there any thing that they glorie and vaunt more of, than the killing of ſome man or other. And inſtead of glorious ſpoyles, when they have ſlaine any, off go their heads: the skinnes they flea and uſe them inſtead of trappings for their great horſes of ſervice. There is not a temple or chappell to be ſeene among them,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:14644:204"/>
nor a ſhrine; nay, a man ſhall not ſee there ſo much as a cottage thatched over head with ſtraw. But after a barbarous rite and ceremonie, there is a naked ſword ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt in the ground, and the ſame in lieu of <hi>Mars</hi> the Preſident and Prelate of thoſe countries which they raunge about, they adore with much devotion.

All of them, as deſcended of gentle bloud, in times paſt knew not what ſervitude meant. And even at this day, they chuſe thoſe for their Iudges and Rulers, who for their long practiſe and experience in the warres, be of approoved worth.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hiles things goe thus in the forraine parts, fearefull rumours ran all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad over the countrey, as farre as lyeth along from the Marcoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni and the Quadi unto Pontus, That the Northerne people rayſed new tumults and made greater troubles than ordinarie, and namely, That a barbarous multitude of obſcure and hidden nations, diſſeiſed by ſuddaine violence of their owne ſeats and habitations, wandered together with their wives and children about the river Iſter. Which newes at the very firſt were by our men careleſſely received as a matter of no importance, for this cauſe, That in thoſe tracts the nations being ſo farre off, were not wont to heare of any warres, before they were either finiſhed or appeaſed. But when the true relation of theſe tidings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came now rife, whereunto was added a rumor of the comming of thoſe Gentile embaſſadours, who by prayer and humble entreatie made petition, That a people flitting from out of their native countrey, ſhould be entertained about the river, it was thought a matter rather of mirth and joy than feare; whiles cunning and skilfull flatterers extolling the Emperours fortune very high, gave out, That from the fartheſt lands of the earth the Thracians offered unto him, before he looked for ſo much, ſo many yong trained ſouldiors, that when his owne power and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine forces were gathered all together, he might have an invincible armie, and for the ſupplie of ſouldiors which was yerely levied and ſent, what from one province, and what from another, there might accrue unto his coffers a great maſſe and heape of gold. And upon this perſuaſion divers were ſent out, to convey over by wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons this fell and cruell nation: and great diligence was uſed, that of them (who ſhould another day overthrow the Roman Emperour) there might not be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind ſo much as one, though he were deadly ſicke. And ſo by the Emperours per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion having leave graunted unto them to paſſe over Donaw, and to inhabite the parts of Thracia, night and day they were ferried and tranſported over, embarked by companies in ſhips, in floats and hollowed trunkes of trees. And whiles ſome of them, in that river of all others moſt dangerous, and as then grown bigger &amp; higher by reaſon of much raine which had fallen, becauſe they were ſo thicke pent and thruſt together, ſtrived againſt the current and ſtreame of the water, and endevored to ſwim, a number of them were drowned. Thus in a turbulent and tumultuous heat of ſuch as were very urgent to have the thing done, was the very bane and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe of the Romane world brought over. And as for this one thing, it is neither unknowne nor doubtfull, that the unfortunate miniſters which holpe to tranſport this barbarous people, when they aſſayed many times to caſt with counters, and compriſe the full number of them, miſſed of their purpoſe, and were faine to give over.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the ſame time, when our limits lying now common and open with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out barres (whiles a barbarous nation diſplayed whole troupes and hoaſts of armed men as thicke as the hote ſparkes that flye from the mountaine Aetna) required in theſe hard points and extremities of neceſſitie to have for the managing and direction of militarie affaires ſome ſuch perſons, as for their brave and noble exploits were moſt renowmed, there were ſought out and gotten together (as if ſome adverſe and unluckie deitie made the choice) noted men, and diſtained with infamie, to have the chiefe rule in campe, and manage warfare: among whom, <hi>Lupicinus</hi> and <hi>Maximus</hi> bare the greateſt ſtroke; the one of them Lieutenant in Thracia, the other a moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Warden of the Marches, but both of them ſtriving who ſhould goe beyond the other in headie raſhneſſe: whoſe greedie covetouſneſſe lying ever in the wind for cheats, was the very matter and cauſe of all evils and miſeries. For (to let all other particulars paſſe, wherein theſe ſaid rulers themſelves, or at leaſtwiſe others with their permiſſion, by naughtie and wicked meanes treſpaſſed againſt theſe ſtrangers at their firſt comming in, who as yet were harmeleſſe and innocent) this one odious and unexampled fact of theirs I will not faile to tell: which if it were to be heard even before Iudges in their owne caſe, could not by any meanes paſſe cleere and bee pardoned. When this barbarous people thus brought over, was ſore diſtreſſed for want of victuals, theſe two moſt hatefull Governors deviſed a foule and diſhoneſt kind of commerce and marchandiſe. For, looke what number and ſtore of dogs their unſatiable greedineſſe could get toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from all parts, they exchanged for ſo many ſlaves, that their chiefe perſons and nobles brought. In this mean while alſo, <hi>Victhericus</hi> king of the Greuthingi, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with <hi>Alatheus</hi> and <hi>Aphraces,</hi> by whoſe direction and will he was wholly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as alſo with <hi>Farnabius,</hi> approching the bankes of Iſter, ſent his embaſſadors with all ſpeed, and beſought the Emperor, That he might be received with like courteſie.
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:14644:206"/>
Which embaſſadors, according as it was thought expedient for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, being rejected, and ſtanding doubtfull what courſe to take, <hi>Athanaricus</hi> beginning ſomewhat to feare, departed; remembring well, how a good while ſince, at a treatie of concord upon covenants to be concluded, he had deſpiſed <hi>Valens,</hi> and avouched, That he was obliged in conſcience, never to tread upon Romane ground, and for this cauſe compelled the ſaid Emperour to make that peace in the middeſt of the river: which notwithſtanding he fearing withall, as ſtanding yet in force, he declined aſide with all his people to Caucalandenſis, a place by reaſon of high woods and woulds inacceſſible, out of which the Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matians had beene thruſt. But the Theruingi, permitted long before to paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, wandered even then neere unto the bankes, impeached with a two-fold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance, for that through the wicked diſſimulation of the ſaid rulers, they were not ſuccoured with neceſſaries meet for their living, and of ſet purpoſe tied to an entercourſe of commerce and traffique, which was horrible and wicked. Which being well and deepely conſidered, they diſſimuled their turning to tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, which was the helpe of their urgent miſeries neere at hand: and <hi>Lupicinus</hi> fearing alſo very much, leaſt ſhortly they would revolt and rebell, advanced cloſe unto them with his forces, and conſtrained them quickly to take their journey and be gone. The Greuthungi having gotten this good opportunitie, when they perceived, that whiles our ſouldiors were elſewhere employed, the ſhips which uſed for the hinderance of their paſſage to skud up and downe the river, were quiet and at reſt, by the meanes of certaine flotes and punts ill favouredly made and ſet together, made ſhift to be tranſported, and encamped themſelves a great way from <hi>Fritigernus.</hi> But he in a wittie forecaſt, which naturally he had, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting what future chaunces might betide, to the end that he might both obey the ſoveraigne commandements, and alſo combine with puiſſant kings, marching very ſlowly, came by eaſie journeyes at length (late though it was) to Martiano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis: where, to helpe the matter, there was practiſed another more horrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment, which kindled and ſet on a light fire the torches of the Furies, readie to burne out, even to the miſchiefe and deſtruction of the State. <hi>Lupicinus</hi> having entreated <hi>Alavivus</hi> and <hi>Fritigernus</hi> unto a feaſt, upon intelligence given by a ſecret meſſenger, with a regiment of ſouldiors repelled farre from the towne walls the barbarous multitude, who as ſubjects to our dominion, and continuing in peace and unitie with us, by way of requeſt continually from time to time deſired to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in, for to provide themſelves of victuals and other neceſſaries. Now, after grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter broyles and quarrels riſen betweene the inhabitants within, and thoſe that were thus debarred, they grew at length to this, that of neceſſitie they muſt make a fray and fight. The Barbarians perceiving their friends and kinsfolke in hoſtile manner to be ſpoyled, grew more enraged herewith, fell upon the ſaid ſouldiors, ſlew and rifled them. Which occurrents the ſaid <hi>Lupicinus</hi> by a privie meſſenger being advertiſed of, whiles ſitting long at a riotous table, amid many ſports and paſtimes, wherewith the roome reſounded, with much drinking wine, he grew heavie headed and drowſie, and gueſſing what the future iſſue would be, ſlew all them of the guard, who before the Praetorium or Palace-gate, as well for honour as ſafetie, waited and attended upon their leaders. Which the people without, who now beſieged the walls, taking grievouſly, growing by little and little to a greater head, in revenge of their princes, whom they ſuppoſed to be detained, threatened to doe I wot not how many ſhrewd diſpleaſures. And <hi>Fritigernus,</hi> as
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:14644:207"/>
he was a prince politique and of quicke conceit, fearing leaſt he with the reſt ſhould be kept ſtill as hoſtages, cryed out, That there would be another conflict with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miſchiefe and ſlaughter, unleſſe himſelfe together with his aſſociats might be ſuffered to goe forth, for to appeaſe the common ſort, which imagining that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretenſe of courteſie their leaders were ſlaine, grew verie fierce and readie to make a tumult. This being graunted, they all went out, and being received with applauſe and great joy, mounted on horſebacke and galloped away, minding to ſet on foot many and ſundrie inſtigations to warre.</p>

Againſt whom <hi>Lupicinus,</hi> having in tumultuarie haſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled his ſouldiors, more raſhly than adviſedly, went forth, and nine miles from the citie ſtood readie to trye it out by battaile. The Barbarians alſo when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo much, brake violently upon the companies of our men at unwares, and with their targuets before their bodies, preſſing hard upon them, as many as ſtood in their way with their ſpeares and ſwords they ran through. And in this bloudie rage both Tribunes and the moſt part alſo of the armed ſouldiors were ſlaine and loſt their enſignes: onely the unfortunat Generall, who minding nothing elſe but this, that whiles others were fighting, he might ſave himſelfe by flying, hyed as faſt as he could to the citie. After this, the enemies clad in the Romans armor, made foule worke in ſundrie places, and no man gave them the checke. And for as much, as after manifold and divers acts, we are come to theſe parts, our heartie deſire is to thoſe (if ever there will be any) who ſhall read this ſtorie, that none of them would preciſely require at our hands every thing in particular that was done, nor the juſt number of ſuch as were ſlaine, which indeed could in no ſort be compriſed.

Semblably in the dayes of <hi>Marcus</hi> the Emperour, a raging rabble of ſundrie and different nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons banding themſelves together, after exceeding great frights of horrible warres, after many a citie won, ſacked and raſed downe to the ground . . . . . . . . . . . had like to have left but ſmall parcels of them untouched and whole. But within a while, after theſe wofull loſſes and calamities, the State was ſet upright againe, by reaſon onely of this, that the ſober auncient world in thoſe dayes, not yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with looſe riot and wantonneſſe, gaped neither after ſumptuous and coſtly fare, nor wicked and deteſtable gaines, but in an uniforme and joynt affection, the higheſt and loweſt agreeing together in defence of Commonweale, haſtened as it were, unto ſome calme haven and quiet harbour, to dye a glorious and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble death.

But upon the Emperours letters which ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were brought unto them, whereby they were commaunded to paſſe over into Helleſpontus, they required without any ſwelling humour of pride, to have their warfare money, meat, and two dayes reſpite allowed them [of the citie.] Which the head magiſtrat of the citie, taking not well, and picking a quarell thereat (for diſpleaſed he was and angrie with them about ſome ſpoyle and waſt made in a countrey houſe of his not farre from the citie) made no more adoe, but brought forth all the commons together with the artizans and craftſmen, of whom there is a mightie multitude there, and them he armed to their utter confuſion: and ſo commaunding the trumpets to ſound the battaile, unleſſe they went their wayes the ſooner (as it was decreed) he threatned them all with the utmoſt perill of death. The Gothes ſore troubled with this unexpected adverſitie, and affrighted with the citizens, more haſtie ywis than conſiderat) preſſing upon them, ſtood ſtill and mooved not. But at length when they had beene rayled at, reviled and curſed at their hands, yea and aſſailed otherwhiles with ſome few caſting dartes launced at them, they brake forth into open defiance, and profeſſed rebellion. And thus, when they had ſlaine a great number of the citizens, whom their over-malapert violence had deceived, and put the reſt to rout, and wounded them with ſundrie kinds of weapons, after they had difarmed and ſpoyled the dead bodies, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Roman armour, they eſpyed <hi>Fritigernus</hi> neere at hand, and joyned themſelves unto him, as duetiful and obeiſant allyes, and ſo diſtreſſed the citie, now ſhut up, with thoſe troubles and miſeries that follow ſiege. In which difficultie of daungerous ſervice, being a long time employed, they ran on head everie where, and without all reſpect. Some of them, who were more bold and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous than their fellowes, periſhed without revenge, yea and many with ſhot of arrowes and diſcharging of ſtones out of ſlings, loſt their lives. Then <hi>Fritiger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> conſidering that men unskilfull in ſieges and aſſaults, wreſtled in vaine with ſo many misfortunes and loſſes, leaving there a ſufficient power, adviſed them to depart and leave their buſineſſe undone, ſaying, That he was at peace with bare walls, and perſuading them that they would ſet in hand without endangering their lives, to ſpoyle the rich and plentifull countries, as wherein as yet there were no garriſons to empeach them. Then they commending highly the kings counſell, whom they knew would be an effectuall partaker with them in theſe projects and deſignes, diſperſing themſelves into everie quarter and coaſt of Thracia, marched warily, having thoſe that either yeelded or were taken priſoners, to ſhew them plenteous townes, and ſuch eſpecially, wherein, by their ſaying, might bee found great ſtore of victuals: and beſide an inbred courage and boldneſſe of their owne, which ſet them on, this principall helpe they had to put them forward, in that there conflowed daily unto them a multitude out of the ſame nation, ſuch as of late had beene ſold by marchants, with a number of others flocking ſtil unto them, whom at their firſt comming over, thoſe that were pined and ſtarved for hunger, had exchaunged for ſome courſe or ſmall wine, and peeces of broken bread. There came alſo unto them for to encreaſe their companie, many that were expert in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after the veines of gold in mynes, not able any longer to endure the heavie burdens and taxations laid upon them of impoſt and cuſtomes. And being with the willing conſent of all gladly received, they ſtood them in verie good ſtead as they paſſed through unknowne places, ſhewing unto them where were the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den garners of corne, the privie lurking places and ſecret receits of the people, and

From whence not farre off, an ineſtimable number of the Barbarians having orderly placed a multitude of waines and carts round in manner of a circle, encloſed apart, as it were, within a circuit of wals, tooke their eaſe and ſolaced themſelves with the rich booties they had taken. The Roman captaines then by the good guidance of better hopes (in caſe fortune affoorded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oportunitie) meaning to adventure upon ſome glorious exploit, wittily obſerved, what the Gothes intended to do, forecaſting this eſpecially, That if they diſlodged and removed their campe to another place (which they uſed very often) they might with confidence ſet upon the backs of the hinmoſt, gore a number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through, and turne away a great part of their ſpoiles. The enemies perceiving this, or elſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intelligence given thereof by the fugitives (by whoſe meanes nothing was ſo ſecretly done, but they knew of it) abode in the ſame place a long time. But ſtrucke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with feare of the armie that was abroad, and of other forces which they feared were at hand to joyne with them, by vertue of a watchword given after their countrey maner, they ſent for their waſt-making companies, which were ſpred in divers parts neere by, and of every great captaine and commander among them well accepted: and ſo forthwith having made light fires at the Carrago <hi rend="sup">c</hi> (for ſo they tearme it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) returning with paſſing great celeritie, they incenſed and incited ſtill their countreymen to attempt greater matters. After this, there was no intermiſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene both ſides, more than ſhort truce. For when thoſe were returned, whom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neceſſitie they had called forth, the whole multitude thruſt togither ſtill within the compaſſe of the incloſure aforeſaid, keeping an horrible noyſe, and ſet upon a furious and mad mood, haſtened in a fell and cruell gare to trie the utmoſt hazard of battaile; neither were the princes of their nation there preſent againſt it. And for that theſe matters thus paſſed, when the Sun was going downe, and the night ſo faſt drawing on, ſtayed them againſt their wils and with heavie hearts to go to reſt, after they had taken their meat as their leiſure would ſerve, they remained without ſleep. On the other ſide, the Romanes having intelligence hereof, continuing alſo watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full themſelves, feared the enemies and their brain ſicke leaders, as if they had bin ſo many enraged wild beaſts; howbeit, with undaunted hearts they expected, that the event, although doubtful and dangerous (by reaſon they were in number much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior) would yet prove fortunat on their ſide, in regard of their more juſt and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous cauſe. So, at the very later end of the day, upon the ſignall of the alarme ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the trumpets on both parts, the Barbarians after they had, as their manner is, ſworne one unto another, aſſayed to gain the hillie places, to the end, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence downe the hill they might with greater violence like wheeles over run and tumble downe before them all that were in their way. Our ſouldiors ſeeing this made haſt every man to his own colours and companies, and ſo ſtanding their ground neither raunged abroad, nor leaving their rankes, ran out of the array for to skirmiſh. When as therfore the armies thus embattailed on both ſides, marched on warily, and came at length to ſtand ſtill, the warriors with grim lookes and traverſe caſt of eye beheld wiſtly one another. And the Romanes verily ſetting up a martiall note on all ſides, which uſeth to begin low, and ſo riſe higher and higher, a noyſe that by a peculiar tearme they call <hi>Barritus,</hi> plucked up their valiant hearts and ſtrength together: but the Barbarians with untunable cries and ſhouts creaked forth the praiſes of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors:
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:14644:209"/>
and thus among ſundry words paſſing betweene of diſſonant noyſe, began the lighter skirmiſhes. And now, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had aloofe aſſailed one another on both ſides with louped darts and ſuch like caſting-weapons, they came togither in mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing wiſe to cloſe fight and hand ſtrokes, and couching their ſhields in forme of a roufe over their heads, they ſet foot to foot and maintained the medley. The Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, as who were alwaies repaired with freſh ſupplies and nimble withall, hurling at our men huge clubs, parched and hardened in the fire, and fiercely foining with point of ſword full upon the breaſts of thoſe that ſtood againſt them, brake through the left wing; which being readie to recule and go down, a right ſtrong and hardie regiment which lay for ſupply, riſing valiantly from a ſide hard by, when as the <note n="*" place="margin">of horſemen.</note> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort now was hard at their neckes, ſuccoured and ſupported againe. When as the fight therefore grew exceeding ſharpe and hot, with much ſlaughter &amp; bloudſhed, every one who was more readie to ruſh upon the thickeſt of the enemies, whiles on all ſides ſwords ſwaſhed and darts flew as thicke as haile, loſt his life: and the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men followed both on the one ſide and the other, with ſtrong arme ſlaſhing thoſe that fled in the necke &amp; backe: likewiſe on both parts the footmen hewed the houx or hamſtrings of as many as ſlipped away or lagged behind for feare. And whereas every place was full of ſlaine bodies, ſome there were that lay among them halfe dead and halfe alive, feeding themſelves with a vaine hope of life. Some were ſhot with bullets throwne out of ſlings, others with reeds or arrowes headed with yron: the heads of ſome cloven with the ſword through the middeſt of the forehead and crowne, hung down with great horror on both ſhoulders. And both ſides not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried as yet with tough fighting, plagued one another indifferently, and ſped alike: neither was there one that ſlacked one jot his owne naturall vigor of bodie, ſo long as his courageous heart ſerved him to ſtirre up his ſtrength. Howbeit, as bloudie &amp; mortall as this conflict was, it ended with the day: and when as many as could any waies make ſhift departed in diſorder, the reſt every one recovered their tents again, heavily appayed. To conclude, when as ſome honourable perſonages among the dead were enterred as place and time would give leave, the bodies of the ſlain that remained, the curſed fowles of the ayre devoured, ſuch as were wont at that time to feed upon carkaſſes, as appeareth by the fields, all over white with bones, at this day. Howbeit for certaine it is knowne, That the Romanes, fewer farre in number, having encountred with that huge multitude, and abidden many deadly dangers, yet not without wofull &amp; lamentable calamities foiled the barbarous people. Theſe chances of battaile thus piteouſly ended, our men went to the next retiring places of Martianopolis, and the Gothes thruſt &amp; pent of their owne accord within the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid circuit &amp; precinct of their wagons, never durſt for ſeven daies together go forth or be ſeene: and therefore our ſouldiors taking the advantage of this opportunitie, incloſed an infinit ſort of other Barbarians within the ſtraits of Haemimontum, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with high hils againſt them, building (as one would ſay) upon this hope, That this miſchievous multitude of enemies hemmed in betweene Iſter and the deſarts, and finding no way out, would periſh by famine, conſidering that all neceſſaries of this life were carried into the ſtrong cities; of which, they never went about to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege any one, as yet being altogether ignorant in theſe and ſuch like machinations. After this <hi>Richomeres</hi> returned into Gaule, minding to bring other helps and means from thence, in regard of greater and more troublous warres which were feared.</p>

Among which calamities, when a gentleman, rich and free but a little before, was dragged

The Barbarians yet, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo many ſavage beaſts broken out of their cages, when they had overrun a great way in that large countrey, went to a towne named <note n="*" place="margin">Develto. <hi>Soph.</hi>

And thus with the ſlaughter of many Barbarians, whoſe overthrow was not ſeene in ſo great a multitude, he was ſlaine.

For in his returne, as he marched ſoftly on with his ſouldiors, marſhalled in good array into ſquadrons, he prevented <hi>Farnobius,</hi> a great lord of the Gothes, as he with his troupes of robbers and ſpoyle-makers raunged up and downe the countrey at his pleaſure, and leading with him the Taifali, drawne but lately into his ſocietie: who (if it be worth the telling) whiles our ſouldiors were diſperſed upon the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full invaſion of ſtrange and unknowne nations, had paſſed over the river, with full purpoſe to ranſacke and ſpoyle the places, void of defendants.

And now the <note n="*" place="margin">Lintzgoewer.</note> Lentienſes, a people of Alemaine, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon the coaſts of Rhetia, by way of craftie and treacherous rodes having broken the league lately made, invaded and aſſayled our marches. Which cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie began firſt upon ſuch a miſchievous occaſion as this: One of this nation ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under the Emperor in qualitie of a <note n="*" place="margin">Armiger, or Scutarius.</note> Squier of the bodie, by occaſion of ſome weightie buſineſſe, was rerurned home into his owne countrey; and, as hee was over laviſh and a blab of his tongue, when many of his countrey-men asked him, What newes in Court? he telleth them, That <hi>Gratianus</hi> ſent for by his uncle <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens,</hi> was ſhortly to make a warlike expedition toward the Eaſt, to the end that they with their joynt and double forces, might repell the inhabitants upon the borders, conſpired to deſtroy and root out the Romanes. Which intelligence when the Lentienſes had with great affection received, being alſo themſelves (as it were) bordering neighbours, and ſeeing how theſe matters went, as they are ſwift and quicke of diſpatch, gathered themſelve into thicke plumpes for to rob and ſpoyle: and ſo, as the <note n="*" place="margin">Companies ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under the Romans.</note> Celtae and Petulantes together, were marching neere the Rhene in the moneth of Februarie, when by reaſon of hard froſts it was all of an yce and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable on foot, after they had ſore diſtreſſed them, not without ſome loſſe of their owne, with maine ſtrength forced them to turne backe. But theſe Germans being conſtrained thus to retire, and knowing that the moſt part of our armie was gone into Illyricum before the Emperour, who ſhortly would be there, grew more hotely incenſed. And conceiving greater projects, aſſembled all the inhabitants of their townes and villages together; and ſo having raiſed an armie of fortie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand armed men, or threeſcore and ten thouſand (as ſome have given out, who love to extoll the Emperours prayſes) being growne to an exceeding height of pride, brake more boldly into our territories. Which when <hi>Gratianus</hi> with great feare had true intelligence of, he called backe the cohorts which he had ſent before into Pannonia, as alſo aſſembled others, that in wiſe and circumſpect policie he had kept ſtill in Gaule, and committed the managing of this ſervice unto <hi>Nannienus,</hi>
                  <pb n="417" facs="tcp:14644:211"/>
a valiant and diſcreet captaine. And to him he joyned as Colleague in equall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and power, <hi>Mallobaudes</hi> Lieutenant or captaine of the band Domeſtici, and king of the Franks beſide; a man expert in warfare, and hardie withall. When as <hi>Nannienus</hi> therefore duely conſidered the variable chances of fortune, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it good to hold off and linger the time, <hi>Mallobaudes</hi> carried away with deſire of fight (as his manner was) and impatient of delay, was much troubled thinking it long untill he might advance his ſtanderd againſt the enemie. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when on the adverſe part they came forward with an horrible noyſe to give a valiant charge, after the ſignall given by blowing of the horne, they began firſt to encounter before <note n="*" place="margin">Horburg, <hi>Rhenano,</hi> Colmer, <hi>Lrenicho.</hi>

But in the verie heat of battaile, our men ſeeing an infinit number of the enemie to avoid open and manifeſt daunger diſperſed themſelves everie man as he could among the narrow lanes beſet with trees, howbeit within a while after they ſtood their ground more confidently: and carrying the like reſplendant ſhew, and glittering afarre off with their bright armour, did put the Barbarians in a mightie feare that the Emperour was come. Who ſodainely turning their backes, yet betweene whiles making head againe (becauſe they would omit no meanes even in extremitie unattemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) they were ſo beaten downe and hewed in peeces, that of the number aforeſaid there eſcaped, as it was eſteemed, not above five thouſand, and thoſe ſhrowded within the thick woods: and among many other bold &amp; hardie knights, <hi>Priarus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the king was ſlaine, even he that was the inciter and ſetter of all theſe miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and deadly troubles. <hi>Gratianus</hi> much encouraged with the confidence of this fortunat ſucceſſe, and now marching toward the Eaſt parts, and turning his way on the left hand, cloſely paſſed over the Rhene; and upon a good hope that ſet him ward, determined (if fortune had favoured his enterpriſe) generally to root out the whole nation, ſo treacherous and deſirous of rebellion. Which purpoſe of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowne by meſſengers arriving thicke one after another, the Lentienſes ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into their dumps, what with the miſeries of their own nation conſumed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner all, and what with the ſodaine comming of the Emperour, doubtfull what way to take, conſidering they could not find any breathing time (were it but ſhort) to bethinke themſelves either to make reſiſtance, or what elſe to doe or goe about, with all the ſpeed and force they poſſibly could, made toward the hils beſet on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſide with unpaſſable cliffes. And taking up their ſtanding upon the craggie rockes and ragges round about, with all their might and maine defended their goods, together with their wives and children which they had brought with them. Which difficultie when it was weighed and conſidered, there were choſen through everie legion five hundred armed ſouldiors of approoved experience and politique skill in warre, to be oppoſed againſt them ſame, as if they had beene ſo many walled fences: Who the more emboldened and encouraged hereupon, for that the Emperour in perſon was ſeen to beare himſelfe manfully with the formoſt in the vaward, they aſſailed to climbe the ſaid hills, minding immediatly without any fight at all, if they might once get the higher ground under their feet, to carrie them all away as hunters preyes. So the skirmiſh beginning when it was well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward noone, continued untill darke night: for why, they fought with great ſlaughter on both ſides. Our men fell to kill and were killed themſelves not a few, and withall the armour of thoſe in the Emperours traine about him ſhining againe with gold and bright colours, were with the flinging thicke of heavie and maſſie

And then, upon conſultation had a good while betweene <hi>Gratian</hi> and the principall officers of the armie, it ſeemed evidently to be a moſt dangerous ſervice, &amp; to no effect, thus all in haſt to ſtrive without intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt ſuch rough bankes and mounts bearing out againſt them. And after much debating, and ſundrie opinions paſſed to and fro (as in ſuch a buſineſſe) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the barbarous enemies had for their defences ſuch places as were diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous unto us, concluded it was, That they ſhold by our ſoldiors ſitting ſtill, and doing nothing elſe, be round about beleagured and wearied out with famine.

The Lentienſes then perceiving him to be ſo fully bent to have their lives, and never giving over his earneſt purſuit, after they had yeelded themſelves to his mercie (the thing that by their humble requeſt they obtained) upon the tendring of their luſtie able young men (as they were commaunded) to bee entermingled with our new trained ſouldiors, were ſuffered without any more harme received, to go into their native countries.</p>

This is he, of whom in a former part of our hyſtorie we wrot thus much, That when <hi>Caeſar Iulianus</hi> made ſome queſtion about the ſetting of a crowne upon his head, whiles he ſerved among his Squiers, and attended upon the palace, tooke the coller that he wore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his owne necke, and preſented it unto him for a diademe: and being a warie and diligent captaine, was remooved from his ſervice at the verie time when all things lay a bleeding: whereas, though he had long before departed and betaken himſelfe unto a privat life at home, he ought, conſidering the great affaires of ſtate ſo required, to have beene brought againe into the field.

From whence, when, upon a new journey by a ſolemne watchword proclaimed, he was come to Nice, a ſtation ſo named, he underſtood by the relation of the ſpyes and diſcoverers, that the Barbarians full of rich pillage, were returned from the tracts of Rhodope neere to Hadrianopolis. Who taking knowledge that the Emperour with a great power of ſouldiors was in his march, make haſt to joyne with their countrey-men, having planted guards for the defence of the people about Berora and Nicopolis: and ſtreightwayes, as the preſent occaſion of neceſſitie required, <hi>Sebastian</hi> with three hundred choyce ſouldiors drawne out of everie band, was appointed to make ſpeed, minding to doe ſome ſervice as he promiſed for the good of the Commonwealth: Who upon great haſt in his journey made, being diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered nigh unto Hadrianopolis had the gates ſhut and locked againſt him and was prohibited to come neerer: for the <note n="*" place="margin">Defenſoribus.</note>

At length, though late, <hi>Sebastian</hi> being knowne what he was, and permitted to enter into the citie, after he had che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with victuals and ſleep (according to the ſtore that the place affoorded) thoſe whom he had under his conduct, the morrow following hee ſecretly brake forth and went his way. Now, by that time that the evening drew on, when he had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

a ſuddaine deſcried neere unto the river Hebrus the companies of the Gothes, well appointed to waſt and ſpoyle, hiding himſelfe for a while within the bankes and ſhrubs, in the darke night he marched ſoftly for being heard, and ſet upon them diſordered as they were and out of array; and performing alſo this piece of ſervice, that beſide ſome few, who by their good footmanſhip eſcaped death, all the reſt fel upon the edge of the ſword: and ſo he fetched backe againe infinit booties and ſpoyles, which neither the citie nor the wide plaine fields were able to receive. For which cauſe, <hi>Fritigernus</hi> being throughly rowſed, and fearing greatly leaſt he, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunat and victorious captaine, as he had often heard, ſhould defeat and bring to nought the bands of his men, diſperſed here and there at their pleaſure, and wholly minding their prey, by ſetting upon them at unawares, after he had called them all backe neere unto the towne Cabyle, he quickly departed, to the end, that making their abode in the open countries, they might neither be diſtreſſed with famin, nor endangered by ſecret ambuſhments.</p>

And for as much as by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eſpiall intelligence was given, That the enemies intended with ſtrong guards to ſtop the paſſages, by which neceſſarie proviſion of victuals was conveyed; to meet with this project and deſigne of theirs in ſome competent manner, there were ſent betimes archers on foot and a troupe of horſemen to keepe the opportunities of the ſtraits, which were hard by. And when for three daies next enſuing the Barbarians marched gently, &amp; for feare of a ſallie keeping the by-waies fifteene miles from the citie, held on their journey to the ſtation called Nice, by reaſon that the fore-riders
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:14644:213"/>
and diſcoverers (upon what error I wot not) affirmed, That all the ſaid parcell of the maine multitude which they had ſeene were not paſt ten thouſand, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in a certain gare and violent heat made haſt to encounter them. And therefore marching in a foure ſquare battaile, he came to the very ſuburbs of Hadrianopolis: where having encamped himſelfe within a rampier, fenced with a palliſado and a ditch, waiting impatiently for the comming of <hi>Gratianus,</hi> he received <hi>Richomeres</hi> the lieutenant and captaine of the Domeſtici, ſent before from the Emperour with letters importing thus much, That himſelfe alſo would ſoone after be there. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenour and contents of which letters, being requeſted to attend a little while for his comming, who ſhould be partaker with him of al perils, and not raſhly to commit himſelfe alone to the doubtfull hazard of darts, he called to counſell di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers great officers of the field, and conſulted what was needfull to be done. And when ſome, moved and ſet on by <hi>Sebastian,</hi> were very inſtant forthwith to give bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, the Generall of the horſemen named <hi>Victor,</hi> a warrior, but yet a warie delayer of time for a vantage, gave his opinion (and many more were of the ſame mind) That he ſhould expect his fellow Emperour, to the end that by augmenting his power with the forces out of Gaule, the ſwelling pride of the Barbarians, now in the flaming heat, might more eaſily be ſuppreſſed. Yet for all this the miſchievous reſolution of the prince, together with the opinion of the courtiers, altogether ſet upon flatterie, who adviſed him to make all ſpeed and haſt poſſible, for feare that <hi>Gratian</hi> ſhould have part of that victorie, which (as they thought) was in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner woon alreadie to his hand, tooke place and prevailed.

For all the treaſure and other princely enſignes &amp; imperiall ornaments, together with the <note n="*" place="margin">or Profectus.</note> Praefect and the <note n="*" place="margin">Counſellors of State, or Courtiers.</note> Conſiſtorians, were incloſed within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the wals. At the length therefore, upon the eight day after, the enemies carts and carriages having diſpatched a great way of rough and ſtonie ground, what time as it drew on apace to the parching heat of noone, were diſcovered, which by the relation that he had of the diſcoverers, were couched and ſet in order round in forme of a circle. And while the barbarous people, as their manner is, kept an hideous, cruell, and fearefull howling, the Romane captaines marſhalled their ſouldiors in order of battaile: and when the right wing of the horſemen was placed before, the greateſt part of the footmen lay behind, and beſet the wayes. But the left wing of the horſemen (conſidering a great number of them were yet diſparkled aſunder) being with much difficultie brought together, marched a main pace. And whiles the ſame wing was in diſplaying and ſtretching out, there being none as yet to trouble the ſame, behold the Barbarians were terrified with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible noyſe that the armour counterfeited, and the clattering which in threatening wiſe the ſhields made; and for that part of them abiding farre off with <hi>Alatheus</hi> and <hi>Safrages,</hi> being ſent for, were not yet come, they diſpatched embaſſadours, to covenant and conclude peace. Whiles the Emperour contemned the baſeneſſe and meane condition of theſe embaſſadours, requiring, That the better ſort of them, as ſufficient perſons, ſhould be ſent to ratifie and confirme, what articles were to be agreed upon; they in the meane while of purpoſe held off and trifled out the time, to the end, that during theſe fraudulent ceſſations of armes their horſemen might returne, who they hoped would ſhortly become; and that our ſouldiors, enchafed with the heat of Summer, with drie chawes might become faint &amp; heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; conſidering that the fields all over, as wide and large as they were, ſhone again with fire, which the ſame enemies ſet a burning with wood and other drie fuell put under for that very purpoſe. And here was not all: for beſide this, there fell out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother miſchiefe alſo, namely, that both men and beaſts were grievouſly diſtreſſed for hunger. In this mean time, to helpe the matter well, <hi>Fritigernus,</hi> as one who wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could gueſſe and caſt what might be, and fearing the doubtfull fortune of warre, ſent upon his owne head one of the common ſort, as an herault, to treat of peace, craving, That certain of the nobilitie and elect perſons ſhould forthwith be ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him as hoſtages; being himſelfe reſolved without all feare to abide the violence of the ſouldiors &amp; the neceſſarie conſequents therof. This project and motion of ſo dread a prince &amp; commander being commended &amp; approved, <hi>Equitius</hi> a Tribune,

who then had the charge committed unto him of the palace, and a kinſman of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens,</hi> with the aſſent of every man is appointed with all ſpeed to go as a pledge. But when he denied to goe, becauſe being once taken priſoner by the enemies, he had broken from them and made an eſcape out of Dibaltum, in regard whereof he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their unreaſonable paſſions, <hi>Richomeres</hi> of his owne accord offered to goe: who willingly had promiſed as much, thinking this alſo to be a brave act and beſeeming a valiant man: and forward he went, minding to ſhew good tokens of his dignitie and noble parentage. Now, as he was going toward the enemies fort, the archers and targuetiers, whom one <hi>Baturius</hi> an Iberian then had in charge, together with <hi>Caſsio,</hi> in a violent heat adventured to engage themſelves forward too farre, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now to joyne skirmiſh with their adverſaries, as they brake out over ſoone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their time, ſo by their cowardly reculing diſhonored the beginning of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow, when as on every ſide they fell to ſhake both armor and weapons, and <hi>Bellona</hi> blew the dolefull and lamentable blaſt of trumpets, our men, who began to give ground at the crying out of many unto them, made head and reſiſted. And verily the fight in manner of flaſhing flames affrighted even the ſtout hearts of our ſouldiors, when they wiſtly beheld ſome thruſt through with the whirling ſhot of darts and arrowes. And then the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies buckling and daſhing one againſt another, like unto ſhips pointed in the beak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with pikes of braſſe, and thruſting one at another by turnes, were with reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall and alternative motions as waves of the ſea driven to and fro. And becauſe the beſt wing of the Romanes horſemen was come as farre as to the verie wagons, readie to advance farther if any had ſeconded and ſuccoured them, being forſaken of all the Cavallerie beſide (the enemies in ſuch numbers preſſed upon them) like as if ſome great rampier or fortification had fallen, was borne downe and diſrayed. The footmen then, wanting defence on their flankes, ſtood in plumps with their companies ſo thruſt and thronged together, that as if they had beene clunged, not one of them could either draw his ſword or bring backe his hand. And by this time ſuch a duſt was raiſed, that no man was able to ſee the sky before him, reſounding as it did with horrible cries and ſhouts: which was the reaſon, that the caſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weapons diſcharged everie way miſſed not, but where ever they fell gave a deadly ſtroke, and did miſchiefe, becauſe their venues could neither be fore-ſeene nor avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But when as the Barbarians ruſhing on ſtill with huge multitudes, overthrew
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:14644:215"/>
horſe and man together, and conſidering the rankes [of our men] ſtood ſo cloſe together, that there could in no place be roome made for to retire, and the enemies likewiſe were ſo thicke thruſt together, that there was no meanes to make way through them and eſcape: then our ſouldiors alſo ſetting light by the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of death, tooke againe their ſwords, and with full butt running upon them hewed them in peeces, and withall ſuch maine blowes were dealt to and fro with axes, that both head-peeces and habergeons were ſlat and daſhed a peeces. There might a man have ſeene the ſtout ſtomacked Barbarian, when his teeth gnaſhed and were ſet in his head, for all his hamme-ſtrings were cut, or his right hand ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten off with a ſword, or his ſide thruſt through, even when he was readie to give his laſt gaſpe, yet in menacing wiſe to looke round about him with a ſterne and terry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eye. Thus, by reaſon that the bodies on both ſides as they fought pell mell, were laid along on the ground, the fields were covered all over with the ſlaine, and with great horrour were heard the grievous grones of men either dying or elſe ſhot into the bodie with deepe wounds. In this ſo great and ſo confuſed a tumult, were the footmen with toyle and daungers cleane ſpent: but afterwards when their ſtrength failed, and their wits would not ſerve to deviſe ſome counſell, now that moſt of their javelins with continuall thruſting and knocking together, were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken aſunder, contenting themſelves with drawne ſwords, they engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the thickeſt troupes of the enemies, as men unmindfull any more of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themſelves, and ſeeing how all about them there was no means left of eſcape and refuge; and becauſe the ground ſtanding all over with lakes of bloud, was ſo ſlipperie under-foot, that it overturned them as they went, they endevoured all they could to ſell their lives deere, and not to dye unrevenged, with ſo great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and ſtoutneſſe oppoſing themſelves againſt thoſe which preaſed hard upon them, that ſome of them dyed even upon their owne weapons: when as now at length all was over-ſpred with a confuſed ſhew of nothing but blacke bloud, and what way ſoever one turned his eyes, there lay heapes of men ſlaine, then without any ſpare at all they trampled over the dead carkaſſes. And withall, the heat of the Sunne mounted a great height, as having paſſed through Leo, and now in his courſe to the houſe of the celeſtiall ſigne Virgo, overcame the Romans: who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they were more weakened with hunger, and undone for verie thirſt, had their heavie armour alſo, to weigh them downe. To conclude, the Barbarians char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them ſtill with ſo maine force, that our battailons being diſcomfited in great diſorder, tooke them to their heeles (the onely helpe they had in this deſperat extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie) and fled every man what way he could. Now, whiles they all thus diſperſed in blind lanes make ſhift to be gone, the Emperour beſet, as one would ſay, round about with horrible and fearfull ſights, by little and little mounting over the heaps of dead bodies, betooke himſelfe to the <hi rend="sup">f</hi> Lancearij and <hi rend="sup">g</hi> Mattiarij; who all this while that the violent numbers of the enemies were abidden, had ſtood their ground ſtill, with their bodies ſound and unſhaken. Whom when <hi>Traianus</hi> ſaw, he crieth out, That all hope was for ever paſt and gone, unleſſe the Emperour, thus forſaken of his owne guard and Squires, might at length be protected by the aid of ſtrangers: Which when a captaine named <hi>Victor</hi> heard, haſtening with all ſpeed to aſſemble the <hi rend="sup">h</hi> Batavi, who were beſtowed not farre off, to ſuccour and helpe at a pinch, for the defence and guard of the Emperours perſon; when he could meet with none of them, he retyred backe and departed. In like manner <hi>Richomeres</hi> and <hi>Saturninus</hi> made ſhift for themſelves, and eſcaped out of the danger. The Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:14644:215"/>
therefore in a furious rage, which ſparkled even out of their verie eyes, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed hard in chace upon our men, who now for verie heat of their veines were readie to melt and faint againe. Some of them fell and knew not who ſmoat them, others againe were overwhelmed with the preaſe onely of ſuch as courſed them: and there were who dyed upon their owne fellowes hands: For neither was there lightly any yeelding to thoſe that ſtrove againe, nor any one ſpared thoſe that yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Over and beſides all this, many lying halfe dead, not able to endure the ſmart and torment of their wounds, ſtopped up the verie wayes; with whom alſo the corps ſlain &amp; hudled on heaps together, filled the fields with carkaſſes. Wel, of theſe loſſes, that never amends can be made for, and which coſt the Romanes ſo deere, the night without all moone-light made an end of: And when it began once to be darke, the Emperour among the common ſouldiours, as it is probably to be thought (for no man ever directly ſaid, that he ſaw the thing or was by) mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded with an arrow, fell with it, and preſently thereupon yeelded his vitall breath, and departed: neither was he ever after found. For by occaſion that ſome few of the enemies tooke up their lodgings there about, for love that they would ſpoile the dead, none either of our men that were put to flight, or of the inhabitants hard by, durſt goe unto the place. The like wofull caſe befell, as we have heard ſay, unto <hi>Decius Caeſar,</hi> who manfully fighting with the Barbarians, chaunced to fall from his horſe, whom being full of ſpirit and courage, he could not hold in; and ſo being flung by him into a bog or moore, could neither ryſe againe, nor be ever found.

And even this young gentleman, when he was afterward returned unto our companies, made relation unto them of this accident in manner and forme aboveſaid. Such was the unfortunat hap of one of the <hi rend="sup">k</hi> 
                  <hi>Scipioes,</hi> whom after he had recovered Spaine, we find to have beene by the enemie conſumed to aſhes in a tower which they ſet on fire and burnt, whereunto he was fled: And yet this is for certaine knowne, that neither <hi>Scipio</hi> nor <hi>Valens</hi> had the fortune to be buried, which is the laſt honourable duetie conferred after death.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His was the end of <hi>Valens,</hi> when he grew faſt upon fiftie yeares of his age, having raigned Emperour fourtene yeares, or ſomewhat under: whoſe good parts and vices, ſo farre as we know, we will put downe. A faſt friend he was, and a faithfull or ſharpe puniſher and revenger of all ambitious courſes. A ſevere reformer as well of militarie as civile diſcipline: Paſſing vigilant at all times and carefull, that no man under the pretence and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of kinred with him ſhould beare himſelfe over high: A right juſt protector and defender of the Provinces; everie one of them he preſerved no leſſe than his owne houſe from hurt and domage: mitigating, with a ſingular regard and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heavie tributes, and admitting no augmentation of tolls and impoſts. In calling for the debts and arrerages of the reſt, nothing haſtie and importunat: A ſore enemie and a bitter to theeves, and Iudges detected for robbing the common treaſure. Neither can the Eaſt Empire remember, that they were in ſuch buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes better dealt with under any Emperour beſide him. Over and above all theſe parts, he carryed with him a liberall mind, yet with moderation. Whereof albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it there are many examples, yet it ſhall ſuffice to ſet downe but one. If any perſon, as divers there be in Princes Courts, greedie of other mens goods, had begged, as the uſuall manner is, a thing fallen in eſcheat, or ought elſe, he would with great reſpect of juſtice and reſervation of libertie for him that could gaineſay the ſuit, paſſe a graunt unto him that had made the petition: but joyning divers times three or foure others that were abſent to ſhare with him in thoſe things by him obtained: to the end, that ſuch buſie and reſtleſſe ſuiters, ſeeing the gaines where at they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, by this deviſe to proove ſo much the leſſe, might deale more ſparily in this kind. As touching edifices, which in ſundrie cities and townes he either repaired or built from the verie firſt foundation, for brevitie ſake I ſay nothing, giving leave unto greater perſons themſelves, to ſhew that more at large. Well, theſe were ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues I ſuppoſe, that all good men are to follow. Now let us as briefly run over his vices. Moſt covetous he was and greedily ſet to gather great wealth: Impatient of all travell and paines taking, and rather affecting exceeding great hardneſſe: given over much to crueltie: of nature ſomewhat rude and ruſticall, furniſhed neither with martiall arts, nor liberall ſtudies: Willingly hunting after gaines and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, though it were with the grievous grones of others. And then was he moſt intollerable, when drawing ſuch treſpaſſes as happened, either to a contempt of the Princes dignitie, or to high treaſon, he cruelly fought the bloud and undoing of
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:14644:216"/>
rich perſons. Neither was this in him tollerable, that whereas he would ſeeme to commit the examination and enquirie of all cauſes unto the lawes, yea and give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſuch buſineſſes and controverſies ſhould be tryed and decided by certaine Commiſſioners appointed, as eſpeciall and choſen Iudges, yet he ſuffered nothing to paſſe contrarie to his owne will and pleaſure. Otherwiſe alſo a doer of wrong he was and wrathfull, lying verie open to entertaine all promoters and accuſers without reſpect of truth or falſitie: a foule fault, and which even in theſe pivat and daily dealings betwene man and man, is exceeding greatly to bee feared. In one word, an idle loyterer, and a ſlow-backe. For colout and complexion blacke: The apple or ſight of the one eye quite cloſed up, yet ſo, as a farre off the blemiſh appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not. For feature of bodie, his limmes well made and truſt together, his ſtature neither over tall, nor yet too low: bow legged, and carrying a good graund paunch before him. Thus much may ſerve the turne to have ſpoken of <hi>Valens:</hi> and that all this is true, I report me to the ful teſtimonie of the time wherin both he and I lived together. Moreover, this alſo would not be paſſed over in ſilence, That whereas in the Oracle delivered from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At the firſt as hee was altogether unpoliſhed and rude, he contemned the ſame; but in the proceſſe of thoſe moſt lamentable accidents that befell unto him, ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full he was, that upon the verie calling to remembrance of the ſaid Oracle, he qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and trembled at the name of Aſia: where, over a towne called Erythraeum, he heard ſay, by the relation of learned men, that both <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Tully</hi> wrot, there ſtood a mountaine named <note n="*" place="margin">Cabo Stillari, <hi>Nigr.</hi>
                  </note> Mimas. But at the laſt, after he was dead, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies departed out of the countrey, neere unto the verie place wherein it is thought he caught his deadly wound, there was found, by report, a tombe or monument of ſtone raiſed above the ground: upon which one ſtone there was faſt laid, which in Greeke letters engraven, ſhewed, that one <hi>Mimas</hi> a noble man in old time was there enterred. Well, after this mortall field fought, when as now the darke night had over-ſpred the earth, of thoſe that remained alive, ſome tooke the right hand, others the left, and everie one as feare carried him any way, went ſeeking for his next fellowes and friends: when as indeed never a one of them could ſee any but themſelves alone, ſuppoſing the enemies ſword was hard at their heads behind them: Yet, heare they might, though it were a great way off, the piteous cryes of thoſe that were left behind, the dolefull gaſpes and yexes of ſuch as lay a dying, and the dolourous plaints and weeping of as many as lay wounded.</p>

But from that time forward obſerved it was, That not one of them (in what danger and deſperat eſtate ſoever they ſtood) ever ſo much as thought to doe the like againe. In theſe ſo many calamities comming thus hotly and ſo hudled upon the beſieged, all on a ſuddaine, with mightie crackes of thunder, there poured out of blacke clouds ſuch violent ſhowers of raine, that they ſcattered the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies of this raging multitude: and after they were returned to their <note n="*" place="margin">or campe.</note> hold, ſet out and caſt into a round forme of their carts and waines, breathing out ſtill more and more their cruell minds and ſtomackes, they fell to commaund and ſummon our men by minatorie letters, and an embaſſadour ſent unto them, upon ſecuritie received to have his life ſaved. But when as he durſt not enter in who was ſent, by a certaine Chriſtian the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were carried and read, which being throughly (as he ſaid) skanned upon, the reſt of that day and the whole night following, was ſpent in preparing of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications: For within-forth the gates were immured and dammed up with mightie huge flints, the weake and undefenſible parts of the wall ſtrengthened, and for the diſcharging from all ſides of caſting weapons, darts, and ſtones, were engines planted in meet and convenient places, yea and there was conveyed neere at hand ſufficient ſtore of water. For, the day before ſome of them that fought, for verie thirſt were endaungered as much as their lives were worth. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe the Gothes caſting with themſelves how difficile and daungerous were

the events of warre, and driven into their dumpes to ſee that the valianter ſort of them were ſlaine and hurt, and how by peecemeale ſtill their forces were decayed, deviſed a wily and craftie ſtratageme, which the goddeſſe Iuſtice her ſelfe bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and divulged abroad. For, certaine Gallants of our ſide, who the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had revolted unto them they enticed, that under a colour of running away, as if they meant to returne home to their owne countrey, they ſhould endevour to be received within the wals; and being entred in, cloſely ſet on fire ſome one part of the citie: to the end, that by a ſignall hereof ſecretly erected, whiles the whole multitude of the beſieged were buſily occupied about quenching the fire, the enemies might breake violently into the citie void of defendants upon the wals. Theſe gallant youths aboveſaid went forward, as it was appointed, and when they were come under the ditches, ſtretching forth their hands they prayed and beſought, That themſelves being Romanes might be let in. And thus received (becauſe there was no ſuſpition to the contrarie) upon interrogatories, as touching the deſignes and purpoſes of the enemies, they varied and diſagreed in their tales. Whereupon it came to paſſe, that after they had beene by bloudie torture far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examined upon the point, and confeſſed plainely, what they came for, they had their heads chopt off for their labour. Now, when all warlike engines and fabrickes were in readineſſe, toward the third <note n="*" place="margin">midnight.</note> watch, the Barbarians forgetting quite all feare of wounds paſt, with many rankes one ſeconding another, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed like ſo many billowes and waves of the ſea, to the gates of the citie, which were made faſt againſt them, and that with much greater reſolution of their mightie men and rulers among them: but together with the armed ſouldiors, both the Provinciall and the Palatine bands roſe up and beſtirred themſelves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quicke to overthrow and beare them downe: And ſuch were their darts and caſting-weapons, that being once diſcharged, though at a very venture, yet among ſo great a multitude they could not light without doing ſome harme. And then our men perceived, that the barbarous enemies made uſe of the ſame wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons and darts which were flung or ſhot at them: And therefore commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given, That the arrowes, by guelding or cutting the ſtrings and ſinewes which knit the yron heads and the wooden ſteiles together, before they were flung, they then ſhould be ſhot out of the bowes; which all the whiles they flew in the ayre, kept ſtill their ſtrength ſound; yea, and if they ſtucke in the bodies, loſt not their efficacie; or verily if they fell to the ground, ſtreightwaies knapped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder and fell in pieces. In this fervent heat of skirmiſhing one unexpected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident there was, of great moment and importance. A Scorpion, which is a kind of Inſtrument or Engine, that the common people tearme Onager, planted juſt over-againſt a thicke battaillon of the enemies, diſcharged from it a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſtone. Which although it tooke no effect, but violently grazed upon the ground, yet upon the ſight thereof, the enemies were ſo daunted and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with feare, that wondering as aſtonied men at this ſo new and ſtrange a ſight, they reculed out of the way, and made an offer to bee gone: But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the freſh ſound of the trumpets, as the chiefe Officers and Captaines gave order, the aſſault was renewed againe: And in like manner, the Romanes for their part got the better hand, as having flung, in manner, no other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, or ſhot, were it but out of the ſlings-loupe, in vaine.

From whence they made great haſt, marching for feare of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying and ambuſhments in foure ſquare battailons to Conſtantinople, gaping after the exceeding wealth and riches there, minding to make many attempts for to force and deſtroy the ſaid citie: whom thus unmeaſurably advauncing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and at the point almoſt to doe violence upon the port-cluſes of the gates, the heavenly power of God repulſed by ſuch an accident as this.

Howbeit, by a certaine ſtrange event, and never ſeene before, the foreſaid regiment of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterlings got the upper hand. For out of it a certaine ſhag-haired fellow, naked in all parts ſave the groine and privie parts, making a ruſtie, hoarſe, and dolefull noyſe, drawing out his skeine or ſhort cuttleaxe, thruſt himſelfe into the middeſt of the Gothes: and after he had ſlaine an enemie, by cutting his throat, ſet it lips cloſe unto the wound, and ſucked out the bloud that guſhed forth. At which monſtrous and wonderfull ſight the Barbarians affrighted, marched afterwards not in any outrageous and prowd ſort, when they went about any exploit, but paced their ground in warie and doubtfull manner. And ſo in proceſſe of time, when their boldneſſe was well abated and taken downe, conſidering well the compaſſe of the wals, which by reaſon of huge and ſpacious <note n="*" place="margin">or houſes ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> Iſlands lay out in length, beholding alſo the beautifull fortifications of the citie, how inacceſſible they were, and withall, the infinite number of the inhabitants, yea, and hard by it a Frith or narrow cut of the ſea, which divideth Pontus from Aegeum: after the worke-houſes of warlike engines were caſt downe which they prepared, and more deadly blowes taken than given, departed thence in diſſolute manner as faſt as they could by the Northern provinces, which they over-ran licentiouſly at their pleaſure, even as farre as to the foot of the Iulian Alpes, which in old time they tearmed Venetian.
