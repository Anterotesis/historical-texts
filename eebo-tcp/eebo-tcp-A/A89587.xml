            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of all mens obſervation and admiration, ſo that <hi>all the Kings</hi> and <hi>all the Nations</hi> might well ſtand amazed at it, and it deſerves to bee writen, that all the Generations to come may praiſe God for it; the firſt is, that when ever the Lord doth build up <hi>Zion, hee doth appeare in his glory,</hi> hee never ſhews himſelf more like himſelf, never more magnifies thoſe excellent perfections of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Power, and Mercy, and Holineſſe, and Truth, then hee doth when hee builds up his Church; This I handled before that Honourable Houſe the laſt day, at large, and now this Honourable Houſe having comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my poore labours, to bee a furtherance of your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and prayer, that you may be the aſſiſtance of God be carryed on the better in your great work of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord in building the Church, while like ſo many <hi>Nehemiahs,</hi> you are building with the Trowell in one hand and the Sword in the other; I could not think of any more fitter, more ſuitable, or ſeaſonable Theame, then to goe on to open the ſecond Circumſtance, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies the building up of <hi>Zion,</hi> which you have in theſe words, <hi>When the Lord doth build up</hi> Zion, <hi>hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the prayer of the deſtitute, and not deſpiſe their prayer;</hi> All the prayers that his forlorn and deſolate people had been offering up many yeeres before, when (it may bee) they deſpaired of ever meeting with any comfortable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, <note place="margin">And containes I a plomiſe of Gods regarding his peoples prayers.</note> they ſhould now finde their Jubilee, they ſhould now have a full crop, of all their ſeed gathered in with joy; when the Lord doth build up <hi>Zion,</hi> hee regards his peoples Prayers: The ſumme of the Text is, <hi>A grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſe of Gods hearing his peoples Prayers;</hi> Hee will <hi>regard</hi> the prayers of the deſtitute, or hee will <hi>turn to them,</hi>

And this is true not onely of the Church in generall, but you may read the ſame of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Gods deareſt Saints, who have been brought and reduced to extremity of miſery, before ever he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their ſuccour: Thus it was with <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the three Children, and <hi>Paul,</hi> and multitudes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

Now (beloved) in theſe deep and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable extremities, learn to judge wiſely of the ſtate of Chriſts Church and people, think it no more ſtrange to ſee the Church of God toſſed and afflicted, then it is to ſee the Sea toſſed with waves, or the lower region to be full of ſtorms, and tempeſts; but when you do ſee theſe things, be you withall aſſured, that the Lord loves his Church, and all his Saints too dear, to be laviſh of any one drop of their blood; he prefers the meaneſt of his people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Kingdoms of the world, and will give them for ranſomes for his redeemed ones, he thought it not too much to redeem them with the blood of his own Son; <note place="margin">Eſa. 43. 34.</note> be you therefore fully aſſured that it is not out of any ſlighting of them, that theſe troubles are upon them, but rather that in all theſe conflicts hee hath holy aimes, and ends, which it may be we cannot yet dive into; and let us not look too much upon the dark ſide of the cloud of Gods providence, when we cannot ſee the bottome of his Counſels; let us not hang down deſpairing hands; Let us be contented that we are of his <hi>Court,</hi> though we be not admitted to be of his <hi>Privy Counſell;</hi> and let us ſet this down for an aſſured concluſion, That how low ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Lord brings his people, he <hi>will bring them back again from the depth of their miſeries;</hi> let us in the mean <note place="margin">Pſal. 68. 22.</note> time, as the Prophet ſaid, he would doe, <hi>Search and try our wayes,</hi> and be humbled before him, but let us alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve upon plain truſt, and <hi>waite upon God, who at this day</hi>

ſet downe here as an <hi>argument</hi> that God would <hi>regard</hi> their prayers, which affords us this inſtruction.</p>

               <hi>That the prayers of the moſt forlorne, and deſpiſed, and</hi>

               <hi>the deſpiſed, he will ſave the afflicted, he will comfort the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, his eares are open to their cry.

               <hi>am deſolate; attend to my cry, for I am brought very low; heare me ſpeedily, my ſpirit is overwhelmed;</hi> as if he could lay ſuch a claime to be regarded when he was <hi>deſtitute,</hi> that God muſt faile of his word, if he failed then to regard his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And there is good reaſon why they above all others ſhould have their prayers regarded by God.</p>
            <p>Becauſe they pray in their prayers: Prayer is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">

And then thirdly,</p>
            <p>The deſolate, of all others, will value an <hi>anſwer</hi> of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; <note place="margin">

            <p>God will regard the deſtitute, becauſe in truth his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly bowels know that there is <hi>more need</hi> that he ſhould <note place="margin">

turne the back upon them; and therefore he himſelf will regard them: he commands us to deale our bread to the hungry; to bring the poore, who are caſt out, to our houſe; when we ſee the naked, that we cloath him; that we draw out our ſoule to the hungry, and that we ſatisfie the afflicted ſoule; yea, he commands his very enemies to regard his out-caſt and afflicted; let my out-caſt dwell with thee <hi>Moab,</hi> be <hi>thou</hi> a <hi>covert</hi> to them from the face of <note place="margin">Iſa. 18. 7 10.</note> the ſpoiler; how much more will his owne tender bowels yerne towards them?</p>
            <p>This alſo is a leſſon of ſingular comfort to every affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <note place="margin">

               </note> ſoule, to aſſure them their prayers and ſupplications are tenderly regarded before God: I have often obſerved ſuch poore forſaken ones, who in their owne eyes are brought very low, that of all other people they are moſt deſirous to begge and obtaine the prayers of their friends, when they ſee any that hath gifts, and peace, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of ſpirit, and liberty, and abilities to performe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, O how glad they are to get ſuch a mans prayers! <hi>I beſeech you, will you pray for me, will you pleaſe to remember me at the throne of grace?</hi> whereas in truth, if we could give a right judgment, all ſuch would rather deſire the <hi>poore,</hi> and the <hi>deſolute,</hi> to be <hi>mediators</hi> for them; for certainly, whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God neglects, he will liſten to the cry of thoſe that are forſaken and deſtitute. And therefore, O thou afflicted and toſſed with tempeſts, who thinkeſt thou art wholly rejected by the Lord, continue to poure out thy ſoule to him, thou haſt a faithfull promiſe from him to be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he will regard the prayer of the deſtitute.</p>
            <p>Why then doe they ſo long goe without their anſwer? <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> why are they and their prayers deſtitute?</p>
            <p>To this you will have a ſatisfying anſwer in the next branch of my Text, which is the aſpect that this promiſe <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:112961:10"/>
of Gods regarding prayer, hath unto the <hi>time, when</hi> he will doe it; when the Lord doth build up <hi>Zion,</hi> he will <hi>then</hi> regard the prayer of the <hi>deſtitute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At another time it may be he ſeems not to regard them, while he lets <hi>Zion</hi> lie waſte, he ſeemed to deſpiſe their <note place="margin">2 Conſider this text in relation to the time, when God will regard his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples prayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> prayers; but when once the time is come, that the Lord will build up <hi>Zion,</hi> he will <hi>then</hi> regard the prayer of the deſtitute; then it ſhall well appeare hee will not deſpiſe their cry any longer: There you will have a full anſwer to this doubt, and I conceive theſe words, <hi>not deſpiſe,</hi> are added purpoſely to prevent or anſwer this doubt; poore afflicted ones are ready to ſuſpect Gods good will, and to think they are deſpiſed, becauſe they have not a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy anſwer, but in that day, it ſhall appeare how farre God is from it.</p>
            <p>And this circumſtance of the time, when God regards them, affords us two other notable leſſons, which becauſe <note place="margin">And thence,</note> they are exceeding ſeaſonable, I ſhall (the Lord aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me) enlarge my Diſcourſe upon them; whereof the firſt is this.</p>
            <p>That <hi>the prayers of Gods afflicted people, which may ſeem for a long time to bee ſlighted, and deſpiſed by the Lord, are</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That prayers which ſeem long deſpiſed, are yet highly regarded, and will bring a timely anſwer.</note> 
               <hi>yet highly regarded by him, and will bring a timely anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I think lies plain in the Text before you in the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> of the <hi>Pſalme;</hi> There was crying for audience, and that his face might not continue hid, that he would incline his eare, but there was no audience to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but <hi>now</hi> when the Lord builds up <hi>Zion,</hi> he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them, he will deſpiſe their prayers no longer, that is the <hi>firſt:</hi> And in this Leſſon there are two branches <note place="margin">Cleared in two branches. 1 The prayers of Gods people may ſeem to be deſpiſed.</note> to be cleared before I come to apply it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the prayers of Gods own ſervants may for a <hi>long time ſeeme to bee deſpiſed.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:112961:10"/>
Secondly, However they may ſeem ſo to be, yet they are <hi>highly regarded,</hi> and will bring a timely anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they may ſeem to be deſpiſed: <hi>deſpiſing,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from God, is a very ſad word, and ſinks very deep, it implies three things, which all may betide the prayers of Gods own people.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A ſilence in God, a ſitting ſtill, taking no notice of their prayers, to let them powre out their ſoules, and the Lord be as if their prayer never came to his eare; that is one thing in deſpiſing, and the beſt of it ſo the Church complains, <hi>O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou heareſt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal 23. 2.</note> 
               <hi>not;</hi> and elſewhere, Keepe ſilence no longer, leſt if thou be as one that heareth not, I become like unto him that goes down into the pit: very often ſhall you heare the people of God complaining, that they pray, and pray, and the Lord regarded not; this is very ſad, as if a childe ſhould lie ſick, mourn, and cry to the Mother, and ſhe ſit by it, and not ſo much as caſt an eye towards it; enough to break the childes heart; But</p>
            <p>Secondly, In deſpiſing, there is more and worſe, when their prayers are entertained with a diſtaſte and diſpleaſure, expreſſing a manifeſt diſlike againſt them; and even that ſometimes betides the prayers of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſo <hi>Aſaph</hi> complained in the name of the whole Church, <hi>How long Lord, wilt thou bee angry with the prayer</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 80. 4.</note> 
               <hi>of thy people?</hi> And this the Lord ſometimes ſhews, by bringing upon them the very thing which they pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt; as if a Childe ſhould beg pardon, and then the Mother take it up, and whip it; when <hi>Retro omnia,</hi> when all things goe croſſe to their prayers, when they ask bread and God gives them a ſtone; <hi>Job</hi> found it ſo, the very thing that he feared and prayed againſt, came upon him; Thus alſo it proved to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when they cryed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:112961:11"/>
to God, becauſe of their burthens, their burthens were increaſed upon them: but in deſpiſing, there is a third thing which is ſadder then all this.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Not onely ſilence, or expreſſing ſome diſtaſt, but doing this with ſcorn and indignation; as he did to <hi>Miriam,</hi> when he ſpit in her face; ſo the Lord doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeem at the prayers of his own people, not onely to be angry, but even with ſcorn to ſhut the doore againſt them; This <hi>Heman</hi> felt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. who cryed day and night before God, when his Soule was full of trouble, and <note place="margin">Pſal. 88. 17. 14.</note> yet then God vexed him, and afflicted him with all his waves, and ſeemed to abhorre and caſt him off; As a man would take an unwelcome gueſt by the head and ſhoulders, and turn him out of doores, and bolt them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; and thus the whole Church of God complains, that ſhe did cry to the Lord, and complained of her ſin and ſorrow, and the Lord then ſet her as a <hi>But</hi> to <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 44.</note> ſhoote his Arrows at; and ſo alſo <hi>Job</hi> profeſſed God did unto him, not onely bolt the doore againſt his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but when he mourned and complained, the Lord did then take his Arrowes of indignation, and ſhoote at his very heart, and gnaſhed his teeth upon him; and ſo did our Saviour Chriſt to the poore woman, when ſhe came and prayed, <hi>Lord helpe mee; thou Son of</hi> David <hi>helpe mee.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h. 15. 26.</note> At firſt he ſeemed not to regard her, would not anſwer, the next time he ſtayed, and when ſhe had delivered her petition, he called her Dog, to her face; enough to have cut the womans heart in peeces: This is wofull indeed, this cuts to the quick, and comes near to one of the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt judgements threatned againſt his enemies: <hi>You ſhall call and I will not anſwer, but will laugh at your calamity, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>mock when your fear cometh.</hi> So you ſee the prayers of Gods own people may for a long time ſeem deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:112961:11"/>
But then the ſecond branch is:</p>
            <p>That even <hi>then</hi> are they <hi>highly regarded,</hi> and will bring <note place="margin">2 Yet then they are highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</note> a timely anſwer. That they are ſo, I might give you abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of proofe; <hi>David</hi> obſerved it in the 31 <hi>Pſalme,</hi> one time he prayed, and God gave him ſuch an anſwer, that he thought himſelf deſpiſed, <hi>I ſaid,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am caſt out of the ſight of Gods eyes,</hi> when he prayed, God turned <note place="margin">Pſal. 21. 23.</note> him out of his preſence, yet follows: <hi>Nevertheleſſe thou heardeſt the voyce of my prayer, when I called upon thee.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Egypt</hi> how long did Gods people mourn there? and their burthens increaſing, it is like they thought God had wholly rejected them, yet <hi>God</hi> told <hi>Moſes, Exodus</hi> 3. I have heard the cry of my people in <hi>Egypt;</hi> But this will abundantly clear it, that the prayers of the afflicted are ſaid to be upon <hi>Gods</hi> file, before <hi>God, Let theſe my prayers</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Kin. 8. 59.</note> 
               <hi>bee nigh unto the Lord night and day,</hi> they lye leiger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God,</hi> they are called a <hi>memoriall,</hi> they are alwayes in his ſight, and he is therefore called in the Scripture, <hi>The</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 10. 4. Luk. 1. 13. Gen. 19. 29. 30 22. Pſal. 20. 3. Pſal. 65. 2. And will bring a timely anſwer</note> 
               <hi>God hearing Prayer, God</hi> hearing Prayer is one of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, hearing is a participle of the <hi>preſent tenſe,</hi> as if you cannot ſpeak to him, under the notion of <hi>God,</hi> but you muſt conceive him hearing prayer; hearing the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his people <hi>at all times:</hi> he is ſaid likewiſe to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the prayers of his people, to carry them in his minde, to have them in his thoughts, and which makes all more <note place="margin">Eſa. 49. 8. 2 Cor. 6. 2.</note> clear, he hath promiſed not onely to heare, but in the beſt time to anſwer them, <hi>in an accepted time I have heard thee;</hi> The Lord would thereby intimate that hearing is one thing, and anſwering is another thing, and there of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is a diſtance between them, but all that diſtance of time, <hi>God</hi> is but conſulting as it were of the fitteſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and the beſt way to anſwer the prayers of his people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:112961:12"/>
The examples are not to be numbred, of the timely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of ſuch prayers: <hi>David</hi> in the 22 Pſalme in his owne name, in the perſon of Chriſt, in the name and perſon of the whole Church, begins with a ſad complaint, <hi>O my God I cry in the day time, but thou heareſt not;</hi> but in the ſame <note place="margin">Pſal. 22. 2. with verſe 24.</note> Pſalm concludes as comfortably, <hi>he hath not deſpiſed nor ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred the affliction of the afflicted, neither hath he hid his face from him, but when he cryed unto him he heard. Abraham</hi> had long prayed for a ſonne before any anſwer came, yet when in all probability he had given over praying, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a full anſwer: So did <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, Luk.</hi> 1. ſo did <hi>Cornelius, Act.</hi> 10. and thoſe ſlaughtered ſoules, <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. who cryed, <hi>How long Lord, holy and true, &amp;c.</hi> at laſt <note place="margin">Acts 10. 3, 4. Rev. 6. 10, 11. with Rev. 8. 3, 4.</note> received a full returne. The building of the Temple after the 70 yeares captivity, was a work long on the wheele, even the time of 7 Princes reigne, yet the prayers for the accompliſhment and perfecting of it, were all anſwered and fulfilled in their ſeaſon, and came (as God promiſes the returne of prayer ſhall be) like the former and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Hoſea 6. Joel 2. 2, 3. Jer. 3. 3.</note> raine in due ſeaſon. And you will grant that this is ſo, and muſt be ſo, that their prayers muſt be thus regarded, if you conſider but theſe five things which meet in them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when the afflicted people of God doe powre out <note place="margin">Reaſons of it.</note> their prayers to the Lord, they doe that which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <note place="margin">1.</note> them to doe, they have his expreſſe commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">
                  <hi>They doe his commandements herein.</hi> Pſal. 50. 15.</note> to doe it, <hi>Gall upon me in the day of trouble,</hi> now that which Gods people do in obedience to his command, cannot be deſpiſed by him: it would reflect upon his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, if duties and performances of his owne will ſhould not be regarded.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when the afflicted ſoule prayes, Gods owne <note place="margin">2.</note> Spirit prayes in them; for they <hi>know not how to pray as they</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>His Spirit prays in them.</hi> Rom. 8. 26.</note> 
               <hi>ought, but it is the Spirit of God in them that makes interceſsion;</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:112961:12"/>
and however the Lord might be thought to quench the ſpirit of his poore ſinfull ones, he will never quench his owne ſpirit, he muſt needs regard that.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, when ever Gods people doe thus pray, <note place="margin">3.</note> 
               <hi>Jeſus Chriſt intercedes for them,</hi> as his Spirit makes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion <note place="margin">Chriſt mediares for them. Rev 8. 3.</note> within them upon earth, ſo Chriſt makes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for them in heaven; <hi>Hee is the Angel of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;</hi> and the Lord cannot but regard that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto him, by the hand of one whom he alwayes loves. And fourthly,</p>
            <p>They themſelves are very dear to God, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <note place="margin">4.</note> beloved, even thoſe deſpiſed ones; he hath none <note place="margin">They are dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belo<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed of God.</note> in heaven or earth dearer to him, then his afflicted ones are: This argument Chriſt himſelf uſes to aſſure them their Prayers will be regarded; in the 16. of <hi>John,</hi> You <note place="margin">Joh. 16. 26.</note> ſhall ask in my name (ſaid he) and I ſay not unto you that I will pray the Father for you, <hi>for the Father himſelf lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth you:</hi> when you come to pray to him, you come not as to an enemy; and though I be your Mediator, it is between you and a friend, not between you and an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <hi>My Father loves you dearly:</hi> we that are evill can give <note place="margin">Luke 18. 7.</note> good things to our Children, becauſe we love them; how much more will our heavenly Father doe it? This argument our Saviour alſo preſſeth moſt ſweetly in the parable of the unrighteous Judge, who through impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity did right to a poore Widow, and ſhall not God much more do it for <hi>his Elect</hi> ones, his beloved ones? And fifthly, <note place="margin">5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>He hath ingaged himſelf by innumerable promiſes, to <note place="margin">He hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to heare them. Pſal. 50. 15. Iſa. 49. 1 King. 8. 33. <hi>ad finem.</hi>
               </note> the poor, the deſolate, and the afflicted, that they ſhall be anſwered by him, Call upon me, and I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thee, in an accepted time I will anſwer thee; many a time hath God engaged himſelfe for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:112961:13"/>
it; and he that commands his own ſervants, if they look <note place="margin">Pſal. 15. 4.</note> for his favour, that they keep their promiſes, <hi>though it be to their hinderance,</hi> though it ſhould be to an enemy; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <note place="margin">Pſal. 89. 34.</note> himſelf will never alter the thing, <hi>the word that is come out of his mouth,</hi> to them who are ſo dear to him, as his Saints are; and therefore their prayers muſt needs be before him: But it may bee demanded, Why then do they ſeem to be deſpiſed? and why doth the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why then doth he deferre and ſeem to deſpiſe them?</note> to anſwer them?</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Firſt, God doth not alwayes defer them; ſometimes <hi>before they call hee doth anſwer them,</hi> and <hi>while</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He doth not alwaies ſo. Iſo. 65. 24. Gen. 24. 45. Dan. 9. 23.</note> 
               <hi>they are ſpeaking hee doth heare;</hi> and as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant noted of himſelf, even while he was praying <hi>Rebekah</hi> came: ſo have many of Gods ſervants found; ſo did <hi>Daniel,</hi> as ſoon as he had done praying, about the time of the Evening Sacrifice, the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> being cauſed to fly ſwiftly, brought him a gratious anſwer, and told him that in the beginning of his ſupplication he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his anſwer: ſometimes the harveſt overtakes the ſeed-time; eſpecially, when their prayers are offered up <note place="margin">Jer. 29. 11.</note> when Gods appointed time is come, or when their need is inſtant and extream, when the <hi>fluctus decumanus,</hi> when the tenth and terrible wave is ready to overwhelm them, <note place="margin">Pſal. 143. 7.</note> he gives them leave to ſay, <hi>Heare me ſpeedily,</hi> and he will not fail them: when <hi>Peter</hi> is ready to ſink, he no ſooner cryes <hi>Lord ſave me,</hi> but Chriſt preſently gives him his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <note place="margin">Mat. 14. 30.</note> and ſaving hand.</p>
            <p>But, ſecondly, it is not alwayes <hi>aske and have,</hi> after asking muſt be ſeeking and knocking, and ſeeking and knocking again; and when it is ſo, God defers them for two excellent ends: The one is his own glory, the other <note place="margin">When he doth it's for the glory of his Soveraignty.</note> is the good of his people.</p>
            <p>Firſt, his own glory is exceedingly advanced by it; for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:112961:13"/>
in dealing after this manner he doth aſſert; Firſt, his own <hi>Soveraignty</hi> in diſpenſing his mercies, ſo as it may appear that it belongs to him to diſpoſe of things and times at his own pleaſure. You know great Lords and Princes make it a great part of their Soveraignty, to have Suiters wait upon them; and it is the great glory of the Lord Jehovah to have his people lie long before him, with their petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their hands: and withall it aſſerts his <hi>free-Grace,</hi> it manifeſts, that whenever he doth anſwer the prayers of <note place="margin">His Free-grace.</note> his people, that it is free favour, were it their due; his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice would not let him keep the labourers hire an houre from him; he commands us not to doe it, but that wee <note place="margin">Lev. 19. 13.</note> may know that all is free, he will have us wait his leiſure; And thirdly,</p>
            <p>Herein he likewiſe manifeſts his own wiſdome, that he <note place="margin">And his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> can and will make both the prayers of his people, and his anſwers to them, when they come together, each of them appear beautifull in their ſeaſon, that as his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is manifeſted in giving them an heart to pray in their ſeaſon: ſo you ſhall ſee it manifeſted, in giving <hi>his</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in his beſt ſeaſon. But beſides, in the ſecond place,</p>
            <p>Hereby he doth marvailous good unto his people who <note place="margin">2 For their good many wayes.</note> thus wait upon him. For, firſt,</p>
            <p>He doth hereby prepare them for their anſwer. And ſecondly,</p>
            <p>He thereby prepares the anſwer to be the better for them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he prepares them to be the fitter for an anſwer: hee traines them up in theſe three or foure excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things, while he ſeems to deſpiſe their prayer. Firſt, <note place="margin">1 Hereby hee teacheth them to pray.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Hereby they grow marvailouſly dexterous in the art of prayer, he teaches them to pray by ſuſpending his anſwer to prayer; you ſhall find in the Scripture, that thoſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:112961:14"/>
men, who have been the greateſt wraſtlers with God, have been ſuch, whom God hath longeſt put off, before <note place="margin">Pſal. 88. Mat. 15. 22. Gen. 32. 24, 25. 1 Sam. 2.</note> he hath anſwered them; <hi>Heman, and David, and Hannah,</hi> and I know not how many of them that have offered up moſt ſoule raviſhing prayers, were ſuch as have prayed till their throats have been dry, and their voyce hoarſe, and complained from years end to years end; God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by makes them skilfull, and excellent Artiſts at it. And then, Secondly,</p>
            <p>Hereby doth the Lord train them up in humility; there <note place="margin">2 Trains them up in humility.</note> is nothing in the world humbles a Soule more, then to be long mourning before the Lord for a mercy, and the Lord not to relieve him in it; nor is any Soule ſo fit for any thing, as an humble Soule; <hi>David</hi> that had been long without his Kingdome, when he came to have it, <note place="margin">Pſal. 131. 1, 2. 2 Sam. 6.</note> could ſay, <hi>O Lord, my Soule is like a weaned childe,</hi> and very vile and baſe in his own eyes: by being long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, they come to be privy to the wickedneſſe of their own hearts; even as a horſe that hath any infirmity, he will ſhew it in a long journey; a leg that hath any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection will diſcover it in a long walk, and ſo will the ſecret corruptions of our hearts diſcover themſelves when God delayes us, hereby we ſhall diſcover the pride, murmuring, diſcontent, ſelf-iſhneſſe, and what ever elſe is naught in our ſpirits, and thereby come to be made wondrous low in our own eyes: and Thirdly,</p>
            <p>Hereby the Lord likewiſe traines them up both in Faith <note place="margin">3 Exerciſe their Faith &amp; Hope.</note> and Hope: he hereby exerciſeth; and thereby increaſeth both theſe excellent Graces in them. Thus was it with <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4. Thus with the poore woman, <hi>Mat.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 19. Mat. 15. 2 Cor. 1. 8. Eſa. 8. 17.</note> 15. Thus with <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. brought even to deſpaire of life, brought under the ſentence of death, that he might learn to <hi>truſt and hope</hi> in God. Thus <hi>Eſay,</hi> in the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:112961:14"/>
name of the whole Church, <hi>Eſay</hi> 8. and innumerable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, have learned both to beleeve and waite, when God hath ſeemed to hide his face from them. And then, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</p>
            <p>By this long delaying of them, as he fits them the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Makes the anſwer of their prayer more comfortable.</note> for the anſwer; ſo he fits his anſwer the better for them, for then is the mercy alwaies both the greater, and the ſweeter: great ſhips that goe long voyages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come home, are uſually moſt richly laden; an Oak is long growing, but proves a great tree, and long-lived, whereas a Gourd which grows up in a night, in another night is ſmitten with a worm and dyeth; a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that is long a comming, is ordinarily a great one when it doth come; The <hi>Lord</hi> makes the mercy the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when it comes. <hi>Iſaac</hi> that hath been begging many a year, when he comes, he is an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a Son of laughter; When <hi>Hannah</hi> had long wept for a Childe, when he comes, he is a <hi>Samuel,</hi> and he proves a very ſweet childe to her; <hi>Solomon</hi> was a childe of teares, a ſon of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">Prov. 31. 2.</note> vowes, but was a pleaſant Childe indeed; ſo was <hi>John Baptist,</hi> to his Parents, who were paſt children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was born: much prayer, many tears laid out for <note place="margin">Luk. 1. Prov. 13. 22.</note> a mercy before it comes, are all abundantly repaid in the greatneſſe and ſweetneſſe of it, when it doth come, <hi>Hope deferred, maketh the heart ſick, but when the deſire commeth, it is a tree of life.</hi> But whether I have anſwered the caſe of Conſcience fully, or no, ſure I am, the Leſſon is moſt plain, that though God may ſeem to deſpiſe his peoples prayers, they are all before him; and will bring an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in due time.</p>
            <p>This is a moſt comfortable Doctrine.</p>
            <p>And I ſhall onely make a comfortable uſe of it in two <hi>Branches.</hi>

We have a huge conflict, we grapple with enemies, that are ſtrong, wiſe, vigilant, that are many, who have all the Antichriſtian, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant part of the Chriſtian world joyned with them; and beſides all this, I am perſwaded, we now grapple with the revenging hand of God, for the ſins which this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath lien in, this hundred years; God doth now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them, and viſits the Kingdome for them, the idolatry, the blood, the Apoſtaſie, and innumerable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evils, and abominations, our troubles are very great, and the event may ſeem very difficult, and doubtfull; but let me tell you, here is that, may counterpoiſe all, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us againſt all diſcouragements, and make us comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably conclude of a good iſſue; We ſhall over-maſter all that are againſt us, we ſhall over-match them, becauſe the ſpirit and power of prayer is on our ſide; we have had (theſe three or foure years eſpecially) the ſpirit of prayer powred out, (I am perſwaded) in the greateſt meaſure that hath been, ſince the Apoſtles of Chriſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon earth; and our prayers have not been in vain, though the full return be not yet made, we have had the firſt fruits, many a ſweet in-come we have had already; But know (Honorable and beloved) they are all filed up before God, there is not one of them loſt; they will bring another manner of return then yet they have done.

no not at <hi>Oxford,</hi> who prayes, <hi>Thy Kingdome come,</hi> but prayes for us, who are indevouring the raiſing up of Chriſts Kingdom; now theſe prayers are all before God, and muſt bring a comfortable anſwer in due time; Nay, this comfort reaches yet further, not onely wee that are now alive, and our prayers, but all the Worthies who are now with God, <hi>their Prayers</hi> pray for us; Though we muſt ſay of them as the Church did of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they know us not; they are ignorant of our condition, yet their prayers which they offered up while they were on earth, and longed to ſee this work proceed, are now really aſſiſtant to us; <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did as really build the Temple and City, as <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> though they were dead long before; That look as the blood of the Martyrs cryed for vengeance from <hi>Abel</hi> to <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and thereby reach a preſent perſecuting gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; ſo the prayers of thoſe who loved <hi>Zion,</hi> do bleſſe and reach all the workmen now imployed in the rearing up of the Church, their prayers ſpeak as <hi>Abels</hi> Faith did when he was dead, and rotten, inſomuch that I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently conclude, that the two Houſes of Parliament, and our Armies (as unworthy as we are) are daily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed upon the wings of many millions of prayers, that have been offered up to God theſe many years, they are all before God night and day; God is only waiting the fit time; and therefore, I beſeech you bear up your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits againſt all other diſcouragements, the Lord will in the moſt accepted time let you know, that all that have ever ſaid to him, <hi>Lord, remember England; Lord, purge thy Church in England; Lord, ſet it up there; down with Prelacy; ſtabliſh Liberty; make way for Chriſt;</hi> they are all before God, and muſt prevaile; and therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly our comfort may be greater, ten to one, then our

            <p>I have oft heard many a ſad ſoule lament after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Did but God heare my prayers, did he but accept me, I would with <hi>David,</hi> call upon him as long as I did live, might but my prayer come up before him, and <note place="margin">Pſal. 116. 2.</note> be lookt upon; but to be thus as a deſpiſed reed, a ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned poore creature, (as I confeſſe I deſerve to be) this daunts my ſoule, that I dare not pray, I am even ready to give over; O (ſaith the ſad heart) I beg mercies, and I taſte wrath, I beg grace, and I feel corruption, I beg eaſe, and I indure torment, I beg love, and I finde diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, all goes backwards; God caſts my prayer out, ſhuts it out from him, and this, this wounds the ſoule; let me to ſuch a ſad ſoule ſpeak a few comfortable words from the Lord; I take this for granted, that the things thou doſt beg, are according to Gods will; thou dareſt not beg an unlawfull thing; I take it alſo for granted, that thou that doſt call upon God, doſt indevour to depart from iniquity, that thou dareſt not call upon the name of God, and walk in ſinfull waies, but thou wouldeſt

be his ſervant; and I likewiſe take it for granted, that thou doſt not expect or deſire audience for any ones ſake, but for Chriſt Jeſus thy Saviour, to whom thou look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; this I hope God witneſſes with thee: Why, if ſo, then it ſeems the onely evill that oppreſſes thy ſpirit, is, God doth not anſwer thee, he doth not give thee ſuch a return of thy prayer, as thou deſireſt: But know thou, Gods anſwering of thy prayer muſt not be meaſured by thy ſad apprehenſions, but by his own word, which word aſſures me that all thy prayers are before God night and day; and for his preſent anſwering of thee, it is no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his diſpleaſure, that he does not give thee a ſudden anſwer; his forbearance is no deniall, the beſt of all his Saints have cryed and prayed, till their throate hath been dry, and God hath ſeemed not to anſwer: <hi>David</hi> had prayed long for an anſwer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 3. when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, <hi>Hee was weary of his crying, his throate was dry,</hi>

            <p>It may be thou ſhalt not ſee the anſwer a great while; poſſibly not till thy death come; Old <hi>Simeon</hi> a good gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man had many years begged of God, that he might ſee his Salvation, yet he never got Chriſt in his arms, till he was ready to depart the world, then he got his full anſwer; ſo it may be when thou comeſt to die, thou ſhalt have hoſts of anſwers ſtand round about thee, nay, peradventure the greateſt returns of thy prayers ſhall be when thou art dead and rotten in thy grave; what thou haſt begged for Gods Church, thy prayers ſhall produce it, when thou art gone; what thou haſt begged for thy husband, wife and children, it may be God will give thee the greateſt return of them when thou haſt no being in

this world; and for thy ſelf while thou liveſt, when it may be, thy heart is dull, and thou art unfit for prayer, and canſt not pray; the quickning prayers which thou didſt offer up many years agoe, God is then remembring them, when peradventure thou feareſt he is taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of thy preſent dulneſſe and diſtemper.</p>
            <p>Therefore goe thy wayes on, and waite upon him, treaſure up thy ſuits, be it againſt corruption, againſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, for thy Family, for the Church, waite Gods time, the viſion is for an appointed time, it will come in the end, that is certain; every tear, every ſigh, every ſhort ejaculation, is continually before him, he hath a bottle for thy tears, as well as a bag for wicked mens ſins, a treaſury for thy prayers, as well as for their blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: let his preſent anſwer be what it will, beleeve any thing of him rather then a rejecting of the ſupplications of the poore who ſeek him in his Sonnes name, hee hath promiſed it, and is faithfull and cannot deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Another thing I obſerve from this circumſtance <hi>the time when,</hi> the time of regarding them, is, when he builds up <hi>Zion,</hi> and that affords us another leſſon as ſeaſonable for this preſent auditory, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>when the Lord doth build up his Church, hee doth</hi>

            <p>There are three things that God is laid in the Scripture to remember when he builds the Church; Hee then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members his enemies, when the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> comes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:112961:18"/>
downe from heaven, then great <hi>Babylon</hi> comes into mind before God, that ſhe may be repaid: then ſecondly, God uſes to remember his Covenant, <hi>hee remembred for them his Covenant;</hi> and thirdly, then alſo doth God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the prayers of his people, and this God willing I ſhall make good to you, for the truth of it, you ſhall finde it fully expreſſed in the 29. of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 10. 11. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the time when he would bring them back to build <note place="margin">Jer. 29. 11.</note> the Temple, <hi>then</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>ſhall you call upon mee, and I will anſwer you; then,</hi> it may be, now he would not, but <hi>then</hi> I'le anſwer you; then you ſhall ſeek mee with your whole heart, and you ſhall find me: ſo in the 25. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in the day that God builds up his Church for that <note place="margin">Eſay 25. 9.</note> is the great promiſe of that Chapter, the Prophet tells you that his people ſhould <hi>then</hi> ſing a ſong of praiſe, whereof this is one part, <hi>Loe, this is our God, we have waited for him, loe, this is our God, and he hath ſaved us;</hi> wee have waited, that is, we have prayed, and attended his leiſure, now wee have an anſwer of all. To make this leſſon more cleare I ſhall indeavour to cleare theſe two things. <note place="margin">Cleared in two branches.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, when the Lord doth build up <hi>Zion,</hi> he doth then remember <hi>the particular wants,</hi> the <hi>particular requeſts,</hi> which his Saints have offered up to him; the Lord caſts it ſo, as <note place="margin">Then God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular wants.</note> to make <hi>Zions</hi> refreſhing time, concurrent with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of the wants of his particular people, that as in executing of vengeance, when he is to execute vengeance upon a nation, he will remember particular malefactors, what they have done in their perſons; ſo when he comes to build up his Church, hee remembers the particular fuites, that his holy ones have offered up to him; and of this I could give you many teſtimonies; In that day he will let every priſoner out of priſon, he will binde up the wounds of every wounded ſoule; he will make the blinde <note place="margin">Eſa. 61. 2, 3.</note>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:112961:18"/>
to ſee, the lame to walk, the deaf to hear; In that day, in the 31 of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> the Lord will ſatiate every wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 25.</note> ſoule, and repleniſh every ſorrowfull ſoule, in that day when the Lord erects his new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there ſhall be a tree of life, the leaves of it ſhall heale the diſeaſes of all the Nations; In that day he gives ſtrength to the <note place="margin">Eſa. 25. 4. Eſa. 35. 3.</note> needy in his diſtreſſe, a ſhadow from the ſtorm, then he ſtrengthens weak hands and confirmes feeble knees, then every wilderneſſe is filled with pooles of water, then Chriſt will powre out abundance of his Spirit, as <hi>David</hi> at his Coronation remembred all his friends, and dealt to all the people every one a bottle of Wine: So the Lord at that day delights to make their perſonall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts joyn with the publick and Common weale of his Church and Kingdome. This is one way how this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is true, that then the Lord regards the prayers of his people, when he builds up <hi>Zion.</hi> But the ſecond is the main.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord doth then anſwer the prayers of <note place="margin">This building up of <hi>Zion,</hi> is the ſum of all their prayers.</note> his people, when he builds up <hi>Zion,</hi> becauſe in truth the building up of <hi>Zion, is the all in all,</hi> of all his peoples prayers; that is, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Money anſwers all;</hi> ſo whatſoever particular ſuites Gods people have offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, the building up of <hi>Zion</hi> hath been ſuch a requeſt, that the anſwering of that, <hi>anſwers all others;</hi> whatſoever he denies them, it skils not, they have enough, they are abundantly ſatisfyed, they will clear all books, and break all Tallies with God, they will give in all other bills whatſoever, if this be but done; that this is ſo, obſerve I beſeech you, whereſoever in the Scripture you read of the <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 1 Kin. 8. 2 Chron. 20 Eſa. 62. Dan. 9. Ezra 8. Neh. 1. 12. 14.</note> prayers of Gods people, (as by the way, you ſhall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read of any godly man, but you ſhall read of his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) you will finde that the ſtrain and the ſtream of all

            <p>Firſt, that of the Church, to Chriſt, it is his <hi>Love,</hi> his <hi>Dove,</hi> his <hi>Fair one,</hi> his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> his <hi>Jewell,</hi> that which he hath laid all his own glory upon; one to whom he ſtands in all relations, which argues intimative dearneſſe, and tenderneſſe, what-ever is done to them, is done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Yee did it to them, therefore yee did it to mee.</hi> The Churches cauſe is his; Her riſing is his glory, her reproach <note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> is his diſhonour: <hi>Ariſe, O Lord, plead thy own cauſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how the fooliſh people reproach thee, forget not the</hi>

And therefore I ſay to you, <hi>Honourable Senators,</hi> that are Noble-men and Gentlemen engaged in this great work, the preſent ſervice you are called to, if really you doe make the building of <hi>Zion</hi> to be the anſwer of your prayers, it is the great <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament project</hi> this day, to ſettle the Church; I know when <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> work was to build the walls of <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> one halfe of his ſervants were faine to carry the Arms <note place="margin">Neh. 4. 16, 17.</note> while the other built, and many times thoſe that built

were faine to have a ſword in one hand, as well as a trow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oll in the other hand, but the ſwords and atmes were to defend the trowell, the work of the trowell was the great project: So will it be with you, you will with that Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, <note place="margin">Ezra 6. 7, 8.</note>

I know Armies muſt be provided for, and Garriſons ſecured, yet they will be looked upon but as meaner; Religion, the eſtabliſhing of it, will be the end, yea your Liberties will be but as meanes, Religion will be the Cap-ſtone, the Creame, and Oile, which ſwims on the top of all, if your hearts be but right with God: Therefore (I beſeech you) conſider in ſecret what anſwer you could make, whether you can call in your ſoules to witneſſe, that after all your combuſtions, labours, &amp; loſſes, if God would but eſtabliſh <hi>England</hi> a beautifull habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, the people made holy, that the Lord might own them, and the three Nations joyned in a Covenant might be one ſtick in the hand of the Lord, in a holy, plous, religious <note place="margin">Eſa. 4. laſt.</note> way, that the flocks might have every one their ſhepheard, and the glory of God the defence on every congregation; if for theſe things you ſweat, and toile, and care, it is an evident token your hearts are right with God.</p>
            <p>And if any of <hi>you,</hi> the reſt of the Aſſembly, do make account that the building of <hi>Zion</hi> is the anſwers of all your prayers, then if it have your prayer it will have your penny, you'll goe, ride, run, and travell, and nothing will ſtick with you, if this be your main ſuit: Indeed in the true notion and interpretation of prayer, it is nothing but the craving of Gods bleſſing upon our endevours in thoſe

things which he hath appointed us to do, toward the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of any mercy, we little better then mock him, if we onely pray, and ſet not our ſhoulder to the wheele. And were this carried cloſe to mens conſciences, how ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would it ſpeak to many, who can abundantly ſatisfie themſelves with joyning in a few dry prayers for the Church, and in the meane while they grudge the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any other coſt? they can find work enough to build their owne houſes, and drive on their owne projects, let God (if he pleaſe) take care to build his houſe, and do his owne work himſelf; let all ſuch hypocrites know, that God will indeed doe his work without them, and their formall prayers will returne, not with comfort into their boſomes, but with vengeance upon their heads. But much more ſadly doth it ſpeak againſt thoſe, whoſe lives and ſubtle machinations retard this work, who to their utmoſt hinder the work of reformation, and would not have it goe on, for feare their luſts ſhould be yoaked, and yet ſet out Prayers, and themſelves ſeeme to joyne with them, that God would build up <hi>Zion;</hi> this is moſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hypocriſie. I remember I have read of one of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of <hi>Germany,</hi> that had taken the Pope priſoner, who commanded throughout the Empire ſolemne prayers to be made to God for the Popes deliverance out of priſon, and he himſelf kept him in priſon at the ſame time: ſo theſe wretched men ſay, <hi>O pray for the peace of Zion, pray that God would build up Zion,</hi> and themſelves waſte it, ſome by their wicked lives, others by their pernicious counſels, ſome by their luſts, ſome for feare the Word of God and Ordinances ſhould yoke them; they pretend to build the wals of it, and yet endevour to undermine the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of it: God in mercy grant that no ſuch be found among our ſelves; but if in truth this be our great

            </p>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:112961:23"/>
ſnapped apeeces, that either prayer muſt doe it, or they have nothing; that is the time he ordinarily chuſes to build up <hi>Zion,</hi> as himſelf ſaid <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. <hi>When hee ſaw</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 36.</note> 
               <hi>their ſtrength was gone, there was none ſhut up or left,</hi> who might be a helper, <hi>then hee himſelf would judge his people and repent h<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m for his ſervants.</hi> So when they were as a woman with childe, near the time of delivery, the children come to the birth, and no ſtrength to bring forth, not any in the earth to be a deliverer, then they cry unto the Lord, and he delivers them; this is ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully <note place="margin">Eſa. 16, 17, 18.</note> to be found in the Scripture, that I may forbear (eſpecially in theſe ſtraights of time) to produce particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtances.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The other providence is this:</p>
            <p>That when God builds up <hi>Zion,</hi> he then uſes to powre out the Spirit of Prayer upon his people, more then at any other times, he then fils them with his Spirit, which inclines their hearts to be vehement, and earneſt with him for that very thing. <hi>Zephyrus vere flat,</hi> this gale ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver blows ſo ſweetly as at ſuch times, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.

               <hi>ſake I will not rest, untill the righteouſneſſe thereof goe forth as brightneſſe, and the ſalvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.</hi> And this is ſo ſure a note of it, that Gods people durſt make Propheticall concluſions out of the Spirit of Prayer powred out, as in this very <hi>Pſalme, The</hi>

the Church, and you ſhall ſee that great builders have been great praying men; <hi>Moſes</hi> the great builder could fall down before God forty dayes and forty nights to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; <note place="margin">Deut. 9. 8.</note> 
               <hi>David, Solomon, Elias, Ezra, Nehemiah,</hi> all their prayers built more then their hands did; <hi>Luther</hi> a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty man in it, and the Miniſters who joyned with him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable and potent in prayer; yea, the Spirit of Prayer uſes to ebbe and flow in the Church, according as God purpoſes to retard, or haſten the work of the building of the Church; inſomuch as the Spirit of God, drawing out the hearts of his people, to doe that which he would have done, doth Propheſie or foretell what God means to doe.</p>
            <p>There uſes to be ſuch a concord and harmony between Gods ſecret purpoſes and his peoples Prayers, their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as ſuch expreſſions of his ſacred will, that they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſeem to decree a thing by Prayer, and God eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes it in Heaven: the prayers of Gods people for the building of <hi>Zion,</hi> is as a <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> before Chriſt, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes way for him, as the Morning ſtar, which aſſures you the morning is at hand: Now theſe two Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Gods doing it at ſuch a time, as they have nothing left but prayer, and this powring out the Spirit of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at that time, do ſufficiently tell us, that God will have prayer to be <hi>the great Builder</hi> on our part.</p>
            <p>Secondly, His <hi>Commands</hi> ſpeak it as plainly; this is a good rule in Divinity; Look whatſoever God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">2 From his command.</note> commands us chiefely to doe in reference or relation to ſuch a work, that would he have us look upon as the great inſtrument on our part, to effect it: as when God commands us to <hi>beleeve,</hi> for the forgiveneſſe of ſins, you may thence conclude that <hi>Faith</hi> is the great inſtrument of our Juſtification; So when God commands us to attend
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:112961:24"/>
upon the word, for our Spirituall life, for our comfort, for our edification, you may boldly conclude, that the miniſtery of the Word, is to be the great inſtrument of all theſe things; And therefore becauſe God above all that we can doe, commands that his people ſhould pray for the building of <hi>Zion,</hi> you may conclude that he will have prayer the great inſtrument on their part, for the building of it. And God hath abundantly injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his people that they call upon him for it; <hi>You ſhall call upon mee,</hi> Jeremiah 29. <hi>Then you ſhall call upon mee,</hi> and I will doe it at your call; and the 36 of <hi>Ezekiel; All</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jer. 29. 11.</note> 
               <hi>this will I do,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>but for all this, you ſhall pray to mee, I will bee ſought at your hands for them;</hi> So again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122. <hi>Oh pray for the peace of</hi> Hieruſalem, and <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 50. <hi>Let</hi> Hieruſalem <hi>come into your minde,</hi> and <hi>Eſa.</hi> 62. <hi>You</hi>

If Gods people bee carryed away captive, &amp;c. and in their bondage pray to him, hee will hear, hee will return them, <hi>His eyes ſhall bee open night and day, to their ſupplication, to hearken unto them in all that they call for.</hi> Inſomuch that by vertue of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which God hath made to prayer, for the building of <hi>Zion,</hi> wee may conclude a kinde of Omnipotency in prayer; becauſe it can rule that hand that is Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; Prayer can wraſtle with God, and by his own <note place="margin">Hoſe. 12. 4 <hi>with</hi> Gen. 32. 26.</note> ſtrength prevaile over him, and (with reverence wee
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:112961:24"/>
ſpeak it) hee cannot ſtand before the power of it, hee could not waſte his Church unleſſe <hi>Moſes</hi> would give <note place="margin">Exo. 32. 10. 14</note> over praying, <hi>Let mee alone that I may destroy them,</hi> and when hee would not let him alone, hee yeelded to him. And therefore himſelf ſaith, if it concern my Sons and Daughters, <hi>command mee,</hi> ask mee any thing. The time would faile, and I might weary you with delight, to tell you what admirable effects prayer hath had in this kinde, what Armies it hath overthrown, what unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bleſſings it hath ſeaſonably brought in, what dry bones it hath raiſed, what weak builders it hath helped, when they have been reforming the Church; how it hath ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sun, turned the Sea backward, chained Kings and their Nobles, with fetters of iron; There is nothing that the hand of God can doe, but when the ſpirit ſtirs his people to pray, in relation to the Church, all ſhall bee done; inſomuch as it is noted of <hi>Luther,</hi> that when once in great danger, God powred upon him, and the reſt of his company, a ſpirit to pray inſtantly and ſervently, when they had done praying, hee cryed out, <hi>Vicimus, wee have got the day;</hi> for hee knew that God was ingaged; ſo that if you lay theſe things together, the Providences of God ordering it ſo, that there uſes to bee no other means left but prayer, and furniſhing them with abundance of the ſpirit of prayer, and commanding them to uſe it, and ingaging himſelf to doe it, you may boldly conclude that the Lord will have prayer the great meanes of the Churches building.</p>
            <p>Now if you demand, Why, or wherefore is it that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhould be able to doe ſo much?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, The truth is, it is God alone doth all, and he takes none in to help him, <hi>propter indigentiam,</hi> but <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter mun-ficentiam,</hi> it is not for his need, but for his glory,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:112961:25"/>
that he will have any helpers: Now beſides all you heare before, concerning the prayers of the afflicted, that it is Gods <hi>Spirit</hi> prayes in them, and they are his <hi>Children,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> their <hi>Mediatour,</hi> and his <hi>promiſes</hi> are made to them, I ſay, beſides all theſe, there are two other great Reaſons, why God hath made over the building of the Church, unto Prayer; ſo far as the Creature ſhall have any thing to doe with it.</p>
            <p>One is, becauſe this way onely is ſuitable with his glory, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. This way God provides, that himſelfe alone ſhall have the glory.</note> he cannot take any to be partners with him in any work, with preſervation of his own Majeſty and glory, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humble ſupplicants, any partner but prayer would leſſen him; But this well-becomes the Majeſty and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God to take in ſuch helpers.</p>
            <p>For firſt, it magnifies his free grace wonderfully, that he will pleaſe to doe it, when his partners in the work ſhall not be able to plead any thing they have contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but tears and ſupplications; And whereas ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand whether freegrace would not be more magnifyed, if God did it without prayer?</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Gods free grace is many wayes manifeſted, and magnifyed in his regarding of his peoples prayers, ſometimes his free grace prevents our prayers, vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing us what we never prayed for or thought of, <hi>Hee doth above what wee are able to ask or think,</hi> ſometimes in exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our prayers, <hi>Hee asked life of thee, and thou gaveſt him</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 20. Pſal. 21. 3. 1 Kin. 3. 12. 13.</note> 
               <hi>length of dayes for ever and ever, Solomon</hi> asked wiſdom, and God gave him wiſdom, riches, and honour, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he as much magnifies his free grace in croſſing our prayers. So he did <hi>Moſes</hi> in his ſuite to goe over <hi>Jordan,</hi> and <hi>Pauls</hi> in being delivered from the meſſenger of ſatan, it being beſt for them both to be denyed. But oftentimes God manifeſts and magnifies his free grace more, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:112961:25"/>
it at the prayers of his people, then if he did it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; becauſe he doth thereby ſhew his free grace as well to their requeſts, as to their need; As if a friend ſhould ſupply my need, it is a great favour, but if he will pleaſe to ſhew his love to my petition, as well as his compaſſion to my need, it is a double favour; So God ſhews a double free grace, when he is pleaſed to let ſuch a great work be done at the requeſt of poore contemptible ſinners, that are fit for nothing but death and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. With men (it may be) he who asks oft and long for ſuch things as men can give, payes very dear for them, but it is not ſo betwixt God and man: the leaſt favour which God can give (though granted upon long ſuite) muſt needs bee acknowledged a free favour to ſuch ill-deſerving creatures as we are, and to have his favours conveighed in a way of prayer, no wayes derogates from the freeneſſe of the mercy, eſpecially becauſe our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are ſo weak and poore, and the mercies of God (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this of building up of <hi>Zion)</hi> ſo great, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay whether he be a more ſilly or proud foole, that will not confeſſe that <hi>God</hi> caſts in the mercy <hi>gratis,</hi> though <hi>hee</hi> have caſt in his <hi>prayers:</hi> yea, that the mercy is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when it is done with any reſpect to his ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>And then beſides, God provides for his glory herein for time come; for you ſhall finde, the Lord is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full jealous of uſing any inſtruments, who will be prone to come to ſhare with him in his glory; he loves not to ſet ſuch inſtruments a work, as will ingrave their own name into the work that ſhall be erected: and therefore when <hi>Gideon</hi> had an Army of two and thirty thouſand, I will not uſe theſe, (ſaith God) they will be like enough to ſay, Our own hand hath ſaved us; He will have ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:112961:26"/>
of whom he will be ſure they ſhall not offer to lay claime to his glory; Now brethren) God is wholly confident of Prayer, that it will never undermine him in his glory, he hath no jealouſie of it; but what he doth to the weeping eye, and the mourning heart, at their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble requeſt, when they have got the thing, all the glory which they will deſire is, to come back again, and cry, <hi>Grace, Grace,</hi> all was grace, all was favour. Thus pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>David,</hi> when he had dedicated one thouſand three hundred cart load of ſilver and gold, toward the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Gods houſe, all the glory he took to himſelf, was but to admire Gods goodneſſe in giving him a heart to offer it, and that God was pleaſed to accept it at his hands. <hi>who am I Lord, that I ſhould have a heart to give any thing to thee? of thy own have I given thee;</hi> Thus will Prayer give God all the glory; But when mercies are not fetched in by prayer, ordinarily God hath little praiſe for them, either they are imputed to chance or induſtry, friends, or wit, or one creature or other, theſe rather wears the glory then God, but mercies wone by prayer, are worne with thankfulneſſe, it alwayes layes the creature low, and exalts free grace highly: This is one reaſon why prayer is ſo effectuall in this great work. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is,</p>

                  <hi>Application.</hi> 1. Inſtruction, what under God hath been our greateſt help, even the prayers of Gods people.</note> prayers? Is prayer the great Maſter-builder on earth? then I beſeech you learn to whom and what under God, we may moſt of all attribute the ſeverall mercies and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances which we have received. It is true, God only hath been our help, every ſtone which hath been laid into this building is an <hi>Eben-Ezer;</hi> we may write upon every ſtone, <hi>Hitherto God hath helped us,</hi> but among all our friends on earth none to be compared with prayer. God hath poured out a Spirit of prayer upon his people, Old men, Maids, and Servants, as well as Miniſters, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-men, and Noble-men, all that feare God, have been knocking at heaven gates with all intenſeneſſe of Spirit, with all earneſtneſſe, that God would ſave poor <hi>England,</hi> and build up his Church amongſt us; and give me leave to ſay it, without derogating from any of your worth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God we have been moſt beholding to prayer: Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take me not, I know there are worthy ones amongſt us, that have done excellently; many of our Nobles have done worthily, many of this honourable Aſſembly have been excellent inſtruments, many of our Souldiers, Counſellors, Miniſters, Citizens, and Commons, have willingly put all they have into this great Lottery, and when the Lord comes to reckon up his helpers, not one of them ſhall be forgotten, not a night they have wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, not a journey you have took, not a drop of blood they have ſpent, not an eſtate any of you have hazzarded, not any paines you have took, which the Lord God will forget, but he will remember all; and your ſelves in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and it may be your poſterity on earth, ſhall know that God hath aſſociated you with himſelf to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this great work; but for all this, when all is done, let us ſay, <hi>Saul hath ſlaine his thouſands, but David his ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands;</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:112961:27"/>
All theſe have done worthily, but among all pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath done the greateſt of all the reſt: How often hath prayer fetched God into our Armies, and rallied them againe after they were routed, and given us the day after we had loſt it? How often have <hi>Moſes</hi> hands lift up upon the Mount, helped <hi>Joſhua</hi> fighting in the valley, and <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his head in the day of battell?</hi> How often hath prayer brought God amongſt our Counſellours, when they have been at a loſſe, and directed them, and diſcovered ſome deſperate plot, turned the counſels of <hi>Achitophel</hi> into foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe? How many in every place (who have ſerved the Lord in this great work) hath prayer helped at a dead lift? Prayer hath hitherto ſaved the kingdome. I remember a proud boaſt of our enemies, when we had loſt <hi>Briſtoll</hi> and the <hi>Vies,</hi> they then ſent abroad even into other kingdoms, a triumphant paper, wherein they concluded all was now fubdued to them, and among many other confident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions there was one to this purpoſe, <hi>Nil reſtat ſuperare Regem, &amp;c.</hi> which might be conſtrued two wayes, either thus, <hi>There remaines nothing for the King to conquer, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the prayers of a few fanatick people;</hi> or thus, <hi>There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to conquer the King, but the prayers of a few fanatick people,</hi> every thing elſe was loſt, all was now their owne: And indeed we were then in a very low condition, our ſtrong holds taken, our Armies melted away, our hearts generally failing us for feare, multitudes flying out of the Kingdome, and many deſerting the cauſe as deſperate, making their peace at <hi>Oxford,</hi> nothing almoſt left us but <hi>preces &amp; lachrymae;</hi> but bleſſed be God, <hi>prayer was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,</hi> they have found it the hardeſt wall to climbe, the ſtrongeſt Brigade to overthrow, it hath hitherto preſerved us, it hath raiſed up unexpected helps, and brought many unhoped for ſucceſſes and deliverances; let us therefore

under God let the Crowne upon the head of prayer, ye Nobles and Worthies, be ye all content to have it ſo, it will wrong none of you in your deſerved praiſe, God and man will give you your due, <hi>Many of you have done wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, but prayer ſurpaſſes you all:</hi> and this is no new thing, prayer hath alwayes had the preheminence in the building of <hi>Zion,</hi> God hath reſerved ſeverall works for ſeverall men and ſeverall ages, but in all ages, and among all men, prayer hath been the chiefeſt inſtrument, eſpecially in the building up of <hi>Zion.</hi>

            <p>It is the moſt abſolute, the moſt <hi>univerſall</hi> medicine in the World, it is a <hi>Catholicon,</hi> it is good for every thing, it is offenſive and defenſive, it will do good in the Army, in <note place="margin">1.</note> the Parliament houſe, in the Aſſembly, in the City, every <note place="margin">It is a moſt univerſall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. 1 Kings 8 33, ad fir em.</note> where: <hi>Solomon</hi> teacheth this 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. from the 33 to the latter end of it: whatſoever plague, whatſoever ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whatſoever other evill, of peſtilence, war, famine, if they pray, help will come; it is of ſuch a large extent, there is no enemy but it will conquer, no ſore but it will cure, no miſery but it will heale, no danger but it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or remove; the healing tongue of prayer is like the Tree of Life, which healeth every diſeaſe: Others may <note place="margin">Pro. 15. 4.</note> be good for ſomething, but Prayer for every thing.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſecondly, it is not onely a help in any evill, but in <note place="margin">2.</note> any extremity of evil: A man, a State, a Church, a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">It will help in any extrem<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

can be in no ſuch extremity, as to be paſt prayers help; if prayer takes them in hand there is helpe for them: if God poure out the Spirit of prayer, if <hi>Eſay</hi> can lift up a Prayer, when <hi>the child is come to the birth, and no ſtrength to bring forth,</hi> prayer will doe it. I have read of a ſtone, I think they call it <hi>Dioſcordis,</hi> that if it be put into the mouth of one newly dead, it will revive him again: I know not how true that is, but certainly there is no extremity ſo great but prayer may help, if any help may be found in heaven or earth. And then thirdly,</p>
            <p>It will help at any <hi>diſtance:</hi> They talk of ſome kind of Weapon-ſalve, that will cure at a great diſtance, but <note place="margin">3.</note> 
               <note place="margin">It helps at any diſtance.</note> prayer will doe any thing at any diſtance. Look what is ſaid of God in the 139 Pſalme, <hi>If you goe into heaven, or</hi>

And then</p>
            <p>It is ſpeedy, it will help at an inſtant; it is like <hi>Elias</hi> his <note place="margin">4.</note> cloud, which his man ſaw when he was at prayer for rain, <note place="margin">It is the moſt ſpeedy help.</note> a little cloud like a hand, which preſently ſpread over all the heavens: the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> could not flye more ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then prayer will flye to help at any extremity, at any diſtance.
