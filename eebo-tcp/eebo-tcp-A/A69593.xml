         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Let my willing and diligent ſervice at all times be preſented, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the <hi>Deſire</hi> of all welfare and happineſſe to you.</p>
               <p>2. Your Letter ſent to me in the <hi>Advent,</hi> I have received, and
underſtand your very induſtrious and Chriſtian Mind and <hi>deſire;</hi> and
though I am a ſtranger to you, yet I have out of <hi>Herr Walters</hi> Letter
ſufficient information concerning your<note n="*" place="margin">Weſen.</note> Converſation and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>3. And moreover, he giveth me to know, your very longing
and induſtrious deſire, in your Letter you ſent me, and therein I am
not only willing, to receive you into my skill and friendſhip, but I
rejoyce moſt highly, that <hi>ſuch</hi> a Mind as <hi>yours</hi> is born of God; and I
exhort you Chriſtianly to remain ſtedfaſt therein: and then you will
attain <hi>all whatſoever</hi> your honourable Mind wiſheth or deſireth; and
you will in a while experience, in your ſelfe; what manner of
writings they are, which you as I perceive, have lately received
from <hi>Herr Walter,</hi> though I ſuppoſe you have very little peruſed them.</p>
               <p>4. But there ſhall very ſhortly, if you be deſirous of it, a very
excellent <hi>cleer work,</hi> be ſent to you, which will highly rejoyce you,
for as I perceive from Mr. <hi>Walter</hi> and alſo from your ſelfe, the Authour
of them is unknown to you, he may well come to be known to you,
if you have a longing after the Noble or precious Stone, <hi>Lapis Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophorum,</hi>
the Philoſophers-Stone, ſpiritually.</p>
               <p>5. Then in that, when you attain it, you will have the <hi>Higheſt</hi>
Joy; you will love and eſteem it above Gold and all the world, for it
is fairer or <hi>brighter</hi> then the SUN, and more coſtly or precious then
the <hi>Heaven,</hi> and whoſoever findeth it, is <hi>Richer</hi> then any Prince on
Earth; he hath the Art and underſtanding of the whole world, and
in him lyeth hidden ALL the POWERS of Heaen and Earth.</p>

there is but a ſmall part of them come to your hands: but there hath
been a <hi>hinderance</hi> that I could not now ſend them with this, you ſhall
ſhortly have them if you have a mind to them.</p>
               <p>8. You will <hi>ſee</hi> very precious Noble rare and excellent things,

               <opener>The Open Fountain of Jeſus Chriſt be our quickning or
refreſhing and Conſtant Light.</opener>
               <p>1. MY very worthy and Loving friend, I wiſh you and yours, and
to all the Children of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the Kingdome of our <hi>Angelicall</hi>
Fraternity, Gods Love and Bleſſing, that the fountain of Chriſt in
us, may ſpring up, grow and bear much Fruit, in which ſprouting,
our true Regeneration conſiſteth, and I hope aſſuredly in God, as
indeed is ſhewed to me, that the time is NEER at hand, wherein it
will cleerly ſprout, which I rejoyce at.</p>
               <p>2. And though at preſent I ſee the <hi>fire</hi> burn in <hi>Babell,</hi> yet out of
the FIRE will exiſt a cleer <hi>ſhining Light,</hi> which will drive away the
<hi>dark</hi> night, but through a great anxious <hi>Birth,</hi> will THAT be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
               <p>3. I exhort my loving brethren, that they would give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into that <hi>anxious</hi> birth or Geniture, that they may alſo ſprout
forth in the Life of God, in the <hi>Light;</hi> and not be comprehended in
the <hi>Turba;</hi> which abominably, at preſent ſpreadeth abroad with its
Properties; <hi>viz:</hi> with <hi>Covetouſneſſe, Envy, Anger,</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> and the
<hi>Fruits</hi> that grow out from thence, powerfully draweth its fire to it,
in which they cleerly burn in many places.</p>
               <p>4. I have upon deſire and entreaty, made a <hi>little</hi> Book of
<hi>Repentance;</hi> together with a form of Prayer; which is all very
Earneſtly, and a right beginning and Entrance into the <hi>Theoſophick
School,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Weicha.</note> which upon deſire I herewith ſend to <hi>Herr R. B. G.</hi> at <hi>Weicha,</hi>
and entreat you, to ſend it to him, and you may pleaſe to open it, and
if you pleaſe alſo to write a Copy of it ſpeedily, only let the writing
to <hi>Herr R.</hi> remain ſealed.</p>
               <p>5. And that you will not, if it may be, keep it above three or four
dayes by you, ſeeing it is <hi>ſmall,</hi> it may be ſoon Copied out, and be
ſent to <hi>Herr R.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Alſo your Brother is not to be forgotten; for without doubt
it will be acceptable to him, and be a true KEY, whom I accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my ſalutations deſire as much good for, as to my owne
Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:57413:9"/>
7. If you would enter into the Practice of this Book, then you
would ſoon <hi>experience,</hi> its profit, for it is generated out of an anxious
Twig, through Fire, and it was and is my own very proceſs
or way, <hi>whereby</hi> I have attained the PEARL of the divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>8. And though indeed, I muſt live in weakneſſe or infirmity as
other Men, yet the <hi>Pearl</hi> is more dear to me then <hi>all</hi> the worlds
Good, for the ſake of which I willingly ſuffer and bear all, that I may
but retain or keep that.</p>
               <p>9.<note place="margin">Sagan</note> Yet I herewith acquaint you, that <hi>Herr D. A. B. M.</hi> at <hi>Sagan,</hi>
hath written to me now the <hi>Third</hi> Time, and deſired friendſhip with
me, and earneſtly entreated me to lend him <hi>ſome</hi> of theſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
               <p>10. But though I have almoſt none of mine at home, yet I would
ſerve him with ſomewhat to Copy out; and ſee whether it might
turn to Gods honour; but if you <hi>obſerve,</hi> that it is to find <hi>fault</hi> with
them, or pry cenſoriouſly into them, which yet I hope to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
then you will know further what to do.</p>
               <p>11. Build and get encreaſe, as you have gotten encreaſe,
from the <hi>Divine</hi> Grace, you will well<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 6. 7.</note>

               <p>12. But as ſoon as you can, ſend him this Letter, written to him,
together with a Treatiſe of your writing, and ſignifie to him, that
he ſhould not keep it long as ſome do.</p>
               <p>13. He is truly eſteemed by me, yet Men ſhould ſee what God
will do; with the book of <hi>Repentance</hi> herewith ſent, when you have

ſo deeply ſink downe into <hi>Reſignation</hi> and into <hi>Repentance,</hi> that

and fell into Gods <hi>Mercy,</hi> let him doe through and with him
what he would, and that he would <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>Repent</hi> through him.</p>
               <p>5. Upon which inſtantly the divine SUN <hi>ſhone</hi> in him,

               <p>6. Upon which, he to ether with <hi>another</hi> Man in the

<hi>my</hi> Book of <hi>Repentance,</hi> THEY were <hi>brought</hi> to IT.</p>
               <p>7. As indeed in a little time <hi>many</hi> MORE alſo were ſeen

how the Doore of Grace ſo mightily moved it ſelf, and in

you, ſeeing you are <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Firſt Fruits</hi> of thoſe to whoſe

               <p>8. Which <hi>you</hi> have alſo received with Joy, and have taken
great pains therewith, and though you do not long after ſuch
a thing as above mentioned, concerning the TWO <hi>Perſons,</hi> nor
labour for it, that you might receive it from God; which if you
did, would be a great Joy to me in my ſpirit; yet indeed a Man
ſhould not purpoſe to receive from God, according to his <hi>owne</hi>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57413:12"/>
                  <hi>Perſons;</hi> that God might with him, doe, know, will, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten,

               <p>1. MY Deare and Worthy friend, Sir <hi>John Sigismund,</hi> after my

               <p>6. Such ſhamefull lying and ſcandall, he hath not only broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

him to complaine againſt it to the <hi>Councill</hi>-Court at <hi>Gerlitz,</hi>

               <p>7. This hath <hi>Friſius</hi> done, and repreſented me to a Councillor
at <hi>Gerlitz:</hi> upon the Deſire of our <hi>Primate,</hi> ſo, with a Lying
Letter.</p>
               <p>8. Upon this, our <hi>Primate,</hi> hath often run to the Chiefeſt
<hi>Lords</hi> of our City, and ſo vehemently raged againſt me with Lyes,
and exclaimed againſt me, and deſired, that as ſoon as I ſhould
come home, they might put me into <hi>Priſon,</hi> and then <hi>baniſh</hi>
me out of the <hi>City,</hi> alſo he put in ſuch a Lying complaint to the
Councill, and Even fired Hell againſt me and prepared the
<hi>Lake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. But ſeeing <hi>Moſt</hi> of the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Councill, had read
my little printed Book, and found <hi>Nothing</hi> unchriſtian-like <hi>therein,</hi>
but was very much liked and loved by ſome of them, alſo by many
of the <hi>Burgers,</hi> therefore many of them accounted ſuch propoſall
and <hi>deſire</hi> of the <hi>Primate</hi> to be unequall, and that there was no juſt
cauſe for ſuch perſecution of me, and ſpake againſt it and ſaid, that
THIS Religion was NOT <hi>New;</hi> but it was even the GROUND of
the Ancient holy Fathers, wherein men might find many More
ſuch like bookes.</p>
               <p>10. But ſome, eſpeciall whom the <hi>Primate</hi> had inſtigated, have
thought it good to ſummon me and compell me to come before a
<hi>Councill,</hi> I ſhould ſee whether the <hi>Emperor</hi> or <hi>Prince E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector</hi>
would not be ſtirred up by the <hi>Prieſts,</hi>
to ſuffer them to lay hold on me, as it is juſt ſo come to paſs, when
I came before the Councill, it was ſaid thus to me; they ordered
me to <hi>goe aſide a little</hi> that they might not be troubled or diſquieted
with me.</p>
               <p>11. Upon this I had framed my<note n="*" place="margin">Anſwer to <hi>Gregory Rick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſwer</hi> in writing and would

have delivered it up to <hi>them;</hi> But the <hi>Primate</hi> hindred, ſo that
they ſhould not receive any <hi>Anſwer</hi> from me in writing, for he
feared HE muſt be conſtrained, to Anſwer for his Lyes.</p>
               <p>12. And ſo it was <hi>not</hi> received by the <hi>Councill,</hi> but I was only
warned to goe aſide out of the way, or a while, to live with ſome
people that would <hi>entertaine me;</hi> and ſo ſubmit to them, that they
might be at Quiet, but No command was laid upon me.</p>
               <p>13. Upon this I anſwered, that ſeeing <hi>Men</hi> would not heare
my Anſwer, that I might declare my <hi>Innocency,</hi> and could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to no <hi>Defence</hi> againſt the <hi>Primate</hi> complaints &amp; unjuſt Slanders;
I muſt commit it to God; and ſee whether <hi>God</hi> would bring me
ſomewhere to honeſt good people, and ſo ſhelter me at length that
I might once <hi>get out</hi> of the Primates <hi>ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14. Which was acceptible to <hi>them,</hi> but they gave NO command
that I ſhould and muſt be gone, but only <hi>admoniſhed</hi> me.</p>
               <p>15. Whereupon I went home from the <hi>Councill,</hi> where, at the
Councill <hi>Dore</hi> in the outward <hi>Porch,</hi> ſome ſpitefull ſcorners of the
Primates retinue, and <hi>perhaps</hi> ſent by him ſtood and deſired me, and
one of them a wicked Buffoone did <hi>anotomize</hi> me from the Crowne of
the Head to the Soale of the Foot; concerning my <hi>Cloaths</hi> and <hi>Gifts,</hi>
and did ſo vehemently <hi>Fall</hi> upon the Holy Spirit and Scorned IT, at
laſt he alſo ſaid. That at <hi>length</hi> the Holy Spirit
would be as Common as <hi>Peeces</hi> of Leather
at the Skinners.</p>
               <p>16. Thus this took an End; and the Primate upon this cauſed
<hi>this</hi> Paſquill or Libell to be printed; and now I muſt inſtantly ſtand
under the <hi>Croſſe</hi> of CHRIST; let God order it according to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell!</p>
               <p>17. I entreate you Sir: that you would let me know your <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
herein, and to ſignifie it to me; I ſuffer it all with patience but
my Children will thereby be ſhamefully <hi>diſcredited,</hi> which yet muſt be,
that the Meaſure may be full, and the puniſhment come.</p>
               <p>18. I entreate you to ſalute, <hi>Herr, Doctor Koſchwitzen</hi> and then

To Herr T. K.
Immanuel.</head>
               <p>1. MY very loving and worthy Sir and Brother; in the Life and
in the <hi>power</hi> of our LORD <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> after wiſhing you
the divine Love, and Patience under the* <hi>Croſſe</hi>
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I acquaint you, that I have ſafely received your
<hi>letter,</hi> and therein diſcerne your Chriſtian brotherly Love, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it was well known to me before, and I firſt rejoyce at your,
and My, health; I am alſo praiſed be God, in <hi>Good condition,</hi> together
with <hi>Herr Melchior Bernt,</hi> gotten hither to <hi>Herr Benedict</hi> H. where
all Chriſtian love and friendſhip is afforded me, and they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in good converſation one with another, alſo my coming, is
Related by <hi>Herr</hi> H. <hi>almoſt</hi> to all the Prince Electors Councill, who
<hi>moſt of them</hi> reade and Love my little printed Book: and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it for a <hi>divine Gift,</hi> and make uſe of it dayly, and have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
times deſired <hi>their ſalutation</hi> and ready good will, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
to me, by <hi>Herr</hi> H. who muſt daily come to them, ſeeing
he practiſeth there, and they <hi>themſelves</hi> uſe him; and deſire I would
ſtay here, they will ſo contrive and order it, that they might come
into ſome Converſation with <hi>me,</hi> as they have come to receive
<hi>more</hi> of my writings: and are daily acquainted with them.</p>
               <p>2. As <hi>Herr John von Loſs,</hi> a very wiſe Perſon, <hi>Imperiall</hi>
and <hi>Electorate</hi> Councellor, who is one of the Chiefe
hath cauſed to be ſignified to me: that he hath ſo appointed his
buſineſs, that he will goe at the End of the Holy dayes to his
<hi>Schloſſe</hi> or <hi>Caſtle,</hi> a mile from <hi>Dresden,</hi> where he will receive me
and <hi>Herr</hi> H. and entertaine us ſome dayes, for good <hi>conference</hi>
and diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>3. In like manner alſo, the <hi>Marſhall</hi> of the <hi>Princes</hi> Houſe
and Chiefe <hi>Maſter of the Horſe;</hi> have ſent to me, and I hope theſe
will, not only look upon me favourably, but alſo <hi>ſomewhat</hi> counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57413:16"/>
my writings: which I account to be all of it a <hi>divine</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and ſhall hardly come home againe theſe 3. <hi>weekes,</hi> becauſe
I muſt ſtay here, and Expect how God will order it, alſo the fire of
<hi>Satans</hi> Anger and Rage burneth <hi>at Home,</hi> but I have good friends
in <hi>this</hi> place and heare nothing of ſuch Tumults and Uproares.</p>
               <p>4. But <hi>I</hi> exhort you in Love, that you would have patience,
and expect what God will doe, <hi>I</hi> have no trouble or <hi>perplexity</hi> of
minde, but am very cheerely at it, that <hi>I</hi> ſee the devill is enraged
with anger againſt me, and doth ſo <hi>belye</hi> me; It is the Badg of
CHRISTS <hi>enſigne,</hi> the Devills Lyes will well appeare, ſo that our
Enemies muſt be aſhamed; let us only <hi>pray,</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Iſai. 49. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>leave the judgement
to God;</hi> he doth ſo even to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Children, his Excuſe which
yet is falſe; will not availe; <hi>I</hi> wiſh, he did ſo Pray, as to bring the
HOLY <hi>Spirit</hi> into the <hi>Desk</hi> or <hi>Pulpit,</hi> then he would not bring the
Angry ſlanders of the Devill <hi>into it;</hi> It concerneth now the <hi>Whore</hi>
in <hi>Babell,</hi> and therefore is the <hi>Devill</hi> ſo veryenraged, with Anger.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>I</hi> deſire you to treat with my <hi>wife,</hi> and tell her, that ſhe
ſhould get <hi>Patience</hi> and give her ſelf to Quiet, and not be ſo fearefull
and <hi>diſmayed,</hi> at it, as <hi>I</hi> perceive ſhe is; for it is very well with me,
and <hi>I</hi> am preſerved with <hi>honour and Love,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> will <hi>not</hi> leave <hi>Her;</hi>
if we have not leave to be in one place, God will <hi>leade us</hi> into another.</p>
               <p>6. For <hi>I</hi> ſee now what the Lords way is, which he will take,
ſhe ſhould <hi>not</hi> count it any diſgrace, becauſe we are perſecuted for
the divine Knowledge and Gift, for the ſake of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Redeemer;
<note n="†" place="margin">Math. 5. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> bids <hi>us rejoyce, when it is ſo with us; for our Reward in Heaven
is great;</hi> I intend God willing, to take care of <hi>Her</hi> and my <hi>Children,</hi>
let her but give her ſelf up to Patience and Peace, and let none put
into her head, but that <hi>I</hi> will have a <hi>care</hi> of my ſelf, ſhe need not
take care about me; Alſo there is a time <hi>coming,</hi> wherein it will not
be <hi>diſhonorable</hi> to her; None know how to ſpeak any diſgracefull
thing of us; but only ONE wicked Man, who belyeth us, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteth
us for Chriſts ſake, it is meer <hi>Joy to me,</hi> to ſuffer diſgrace for
Chriſts ſake and his Gift, alſo our Enemy muſt help to <hi>promote</hi> our
<hi>Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. The Threats of our Enemy is only his evill malicious will, who
knoweth but <hi>a Hooke may be put into his Noſtrills?</hi> I will not let it be
unknown to the <hi>Prince Electours Councell,</hi> and indeed they cleerly
know it, and doe not ſpeake well of it, in him, alſo I hope <hi>I</hi> ſhall
come perſonally before the <hi>Illuſtrious Prince Electour</hi>
himſelf, and doe hope all will be well, he neede not lift up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo aloſt and reſt on Lyes and upon Man, his Chriſtian Heart will
be manifeſt well enough, even his preſent friends may well ſpeake
<hi>againſt</hi> him.</p>
               <p>

8. But ſince he ſuppoſeth it not to be right, that my book is gone
forth under <hi>No Name;</hi> therefore I hope ſuddenly it will goe forth
under <hi>a Name,</hi> he ſhall not hinder it, I have good opportunity: alſo
there are this preſent <hi>Leipſig-Mart,</hi> come forth many <hi>ſuch like</hi> bookes
in print;<note place="margin">Leipſig Mart</note> he may hinder them, if he think he is the <hi>Man</hi> that <hi>can</hi> doe

called <hi>Babell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. Concerning my Son <hi>Jacob,</hi> that he is come home, I rejoyce,
and deſire that he would ſtay at <hi>Gerlitz</hi> till my coming, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
diſpute or make contention with any, becauſe of ſcornefull
people, that Gods Gifts be not ſcandalized, and leaſt the <hi>Enemy</hi> might
ſay, that we would take up the<note n="*" place="margin">NOTE.</note> 
                  <hi>Sword,</hi> and raiſe uproares, but to
have a little Patience, that our good things may be <hi>planted</hi> with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and benefit to others, and we be known to be the children of
CHRIST;</p>
               <p>10. For the Age that is <hi>Coming,</hi> will not be in contention
or diſputing biting and devouring, but in Love and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Peace and Joy in the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the
<hi>divine</hi> Gift.</p>
               <p>11. But ſeeing God hath together choſen us to be firſt fruits,
therefore we ſhould begin aright, and ſtand <hi>as a</hi> Roſe <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the</hi> Thornes; for our Native Country is in Heaven
and not upon Earth, therefore let us labour for THAT.</p>
               <p>12, I entreate you to Salute my <hi>wife,</hi> and all our good <hi>brethren</hi> in
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> with our Love, eſpecially, ſignifie my Condition to <hi>Herr
Hans Roten</hi> that he may write it to his brother <hi>Horr Carel Endern</hi>
and his brother <hi>Michael Endern,</hi> that it might come to the knowledg
of <hi>Herr Hans Sigmund,</hi> how it is with me at preſent, and that you
would write to them with the ſooneſt, for I cannot now doe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of hinderance; but <hi>Comfort my wife,</hi> that ſhe may let goe her
<hi>fruitleſs care,</hi> there is no danger about me, I am at preſent as well
and better then at <hi>Gerlitz;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gerlitz.</note> but let her ſtay at home and be at Reſt, and
let <hi>Babell</hi> Burne, our Enemy ſtandeth in the <hi>Fire,</hi> and therefore

CHRIST. </p>

and indeed the Chiefeſt of them, very Chriſtian Loving Gentlemen
to whom this <hi>Theoſophick</hi> Ground is very acceptible, and alſo do read

Hands of very <hi>Many Officers</hi> and other <hi>Learned Men,</hi> all which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to be Good, and a Gift from God, and they Labour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive,

looked upon by the Counſell and Learned; and ſome ſuppoſe, that
the Malicious Evill <hi>Spitefull Spirit</hi> hath dictated it to him, and he is

               <p>5. Alſo ſome of the chiefeſt Councellours, have cauſed their
Good Will to be made known to me, and ſignified that the <hi>ſooneſt day</hi>
they have opportunity, they will cauſe me to be invited to them, for
a Chriſtian converſe and <hi>conference</hi> with <hi>me,</hi> which I look for, and

perplex her ſelf by reaſon of me, but diligently <hi>pray,</hi> that God would
order it for the beſt, and if ſhe want any thing ſhe knoweth very well
where ſhe may have it, ſhe ſhould only <hi>keep</hi> WITHIN, and a little
ſubmit her ſelf; this ſtormy Tempeſt will ſoon paſſe over, and the

I ſay, if he have <hi>not enough</hi> of the written Anſwer, I will commit it to
the <hi>Preſſe,</hi> as it ſeemeth Good to many <hi>Learned</hi> Perſons ſo to do: I
know alſo a good cauſe for it; It were good for him to keep his mouth
from ſlandering, elſe he muſt ſee and hear, that which will not pleaſe
him.</p>
               <p>11. Though indeed I have <hi>no</hi> pleaſure in THAT, for I perceive
very well, that the Devill would fain <hi>Sully</hi> and defile my Talent
with <hi>Contention</hi> and DISPUTATION;
but I hope to ſtand under the Divine Protection and Defence, for I
find now powerfully, how God leadeth and <hi>protecteth</hi> his Children,
Therefore HE is to be praiſed.</p>
               <p>12. And it will not ſo be, that the <hi>Primate,</hi> will be able to hunt all
thoſe people from <hi>Gaerlitz;</hi> who read my little Book, for then muſt
he alſo come to <hi>Dreſden,</hi> and into many other places, and hunt away
the <hi>Prince Electours Councell</hi> and <hi>Prieſts;</hi> but let him have a care, that
Gods Anger do not hunt him into the <hi>Helliſh</hi> Fire 🜂
it were good to Repent.</p>
               <p>13. But if he will begin a <hi>Reformation,</hi> then will the <hi>Prince Electour</hi>
alſo look into it, what <hi>Manner</hi> of Reformation he hath in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
you need not be afraid of him, it is but a <hi>Phariſaicall zeal</hi> without

               <p>14. I hope yet, the Time of the <hi>Great Reformation</hi> will ſuddenly
come, wherein Men will be <hi>commanded</hi> to Reform, and to Teach

Children of Chriſt: Let him come but to <hi>Dreſden</hi> into the Book-Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers

looketh like my Ground as to what concerneth the <hi>Theologicall</hi>
Ground: I hear in this place none reproach it, for it is read with
<hi>Joy;</hi> as even the <hi>Superintendent</hi> himſelf, and <hi>Doctor Hŏe</hi> do now teach

               <p>1. MOſt Honourable highly eſteemed Sir: and faithfull friend, your
Salvation and welfare is very acceptable to me, I would
long agoe have viſited you with a <hi>Letter,</hi> for I long alſo to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
your condition; ſeeing you give your ſelf to the Study of
WISDOME, which is more dear to me then the <hi>whole</hi> world, and do
wiſh that I might once <hi>conferre</hi> with you therein as it is neceſſary: as
I hope ſhortly to make a Journey towards you, then will I ſpeak
with you.</p>
               <p>2. Hitherto I have been hindered by Gods permiſſion, for I have
been theſe <hi>Six Weeks,</hi> caſt down into the Sickneſſe of the Evill rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<hi>Soldiers,</hi> and ſcarce come to health again.</p>
               <p>3. Alſo how it is with our Dr. <hi>Waltern,</hi> or where he is if you know
any thing of him, ſignifie it to me; alſo how you go on in your
ſtudy, whether the Grace Dore be <hi>more</hi> opened to you, to apprehend
the high Divine Myſtery, it would be very acceptable to me to <hi>know;</hi>
for I hope if you order your life therein, and did bring the <hi>Practice</hi>
into Exerciſe, that Dore would be opened to you, ſo that you would
ſee, with right or true <hi>Magicall <hi>Eyes</hi> in Magiam Divinam</hi>
into the Divine <hi>Magia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. For ſo ſoon as the Sprout of the <hi>New Man</hi> ſpringeth, it hath its
Seeing or Sight; for as the outward Man ſeeth this <hi>outward</hi> world, ſo
alſo the New Man, ſeeth the <hi>divine</hi> world, wherein it dwelleth; for
it is written;<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>The Spirit of Man</hi> in the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>ſearcheth all
things, even the depths of the Deity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. And although, it lyeth not in the <hi>Searching</hi> and flying aloft, if
men will ſearch in <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but in a humble lowly ſubmitting to
enter into it, that the Soul deſire Nothing but <hi>Gods Love;</hi> now when
it attaineth THAT, then it ſuddenly bringeth the richly joyfull Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, the Souls Image or the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of God, into the Heavenly
Divine <hi>School</hi> of the Noble and precious knowledge; where then it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57413:20"/>
is taught <hi>more</hi> then in the School of this world; for it ſtudyeth in the
School of the <hi>Divine</hi> Wiſdome; The Holy Spirit is its
School-maſter, alſo its knowing and <hi>underſtanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. It is no knowing of God, that a CREATURE knoweth or
feeleth God, but THAT knowledge only which is <hi>IN</hi> God: The
Twig draweth into it, the Sap of the Tree; if a Man be not with his
will-ſpirit entered into God, but into the outward Reaſon, then he
is BLIND to <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. But if he with earneſtneſſe deſireth God, then he becometh in
his <hi>Deſire</hi> impregnate with Gods Subſtance, and Gods Subſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
given to him for his OWN propriety, wherein the Spirit of
God ruleth; and he becometh <hi>Gods</hi> Child, <hi>viz:</hi> a Twig on the
Tree.</p>
               <p>8. Seeing then I perceive from <hi>Herr Walter,</hi> that you lead your
Life in<note n="†" place="margin">Prov. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>The Fear of God;</hi> and he ſheweth me alſo your writings, that
you have a deſire after the <hi>Divine Wiſdome;</hi> and after the well-ſpring
or fountain of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> therefore I am the more encouraged to write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, and to inform you of the WAY thereof, for it affordeth me
meer Joy, when I diſcern any of Gods Children.</p>
               <p>9. Juſt as one Twig of a Tree, enjoyeth it ſelf with the other in
the Tree, with an amiable or Lovely Eſſence, ſo alſo do the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

do but ſignifie it to me, and it ſhall be brought into an <hi>eaſier</hi>

Thoughts, I would ſet it down <hi>more ſimply</hi> and Childlike, whereby
the Pearl might be ſought and found <hi>with delight;</hi> for it is not given
in vain.</p>
               <p>10. But ſeeing you are one of the <hi>Firſt,</hi> whom God will favour
with it; therefore I exhort you, in true Chriſtian Love, that you
would diligently ſeek the Noble <hi>Jewel;</hi> you will certainly attain it,
for though it ſeems as if it would not; let not THAT diſcourage
you, and do not ſhrink back, but ſtand ſtill; If any will be a

it, his Children muſt be proved or <hi>Tryed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. We muſt enter into <hi>Combate</hi> againſt the Old <hi>Adam,</hi> and kill
him, if a New be to grow out of him; if the faire Crown or Garland
be once ſet upon you; then it would afterwards <hi>need no more</hi> ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>1. MY very deare Sir and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faithfull friend, I Heartily wiſh
you the divine Love, that the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> in Soule and
Spirit may Eternally ſhine to you! If it ſtill goe well with you, it
would be great Joy to me, to know; God be prayſed I am at this time
in Good bodily Health: But very much outwardly <hi>beſpattered</hi> with
Sathans <hi>Dirt,</hi> by the Phariſaicall ſpirit; for how very enraged <hi>Sathan</hi>
is at me and my printed little Booke of <hi>Repentance,</hi> I can
ſcarce write to you, and only from the Chiefe <hi>Phariſee</hi> and thoſe that
are like him; For they feare leaſt their Authority and Reſpect might
fall, if <hi>unlearned</hi> people ſhould bring forth the <hi>higheſt</hi> Ground,
and that people might require of them the Imitation or <hi>following</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in Life and Doctrine, then muſt their Belly-God
fall, and their Minde be ſomewhat more lowly, all which, doth
not reliſh.</p>
               <p>2. But it <hi>muſt</hi> come to paſſe, the Time is generated or Borne,
and no Reproaching will <hi>help;</hi> for by their Reproaching they cauſe
the People to <hi>ask</hi> after theſe Writings, and ſo they further them, <hi>more</hi>
then hinder them, as is done among us at preſent; that almoſt every
one would faine <hi>ſee them,</hi> and find the Great wonder, and what kinde
of wilde Beaſt is therein, and when they come to <hi>reade</hi> them,
they are amazed at their Blindneſs, and enter into themſelves, and
conſider their Lives according to it, whereby very Many of them
have <hi>Converted,</hi> and have entered into <hi>Repentance,</hi> and have deſired
friendſhip with me, and thoſe which <hi>before</hi> had been reproachers are
become afterwards the <hi>Sheepe</hi> of Chriſt. So very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
the Lord manageth his way, and <hi>all things muſt ſerve for the Beſt to
Gods children.</hi>

that was in the Preſſe at Amſterdam, in the Year 1658.</head>
            <opener>The Grace of God, together with brotherly Love and
Faithfulneſſe, I deſire to commend to you.</opener>
            <p>1. TO give you information and Teſtimony concerning the Bleſſed
<hi>Jacob Behme Teutonicus,</hi> I am in the preſence of
God willing and inclined to do it, but know <hi>little</hi> of him by my
own <hi>Experience;</hi> yet ſo much as is known to me, I write to your
Honour, with a hearty good will, and acknowledge my ſelf obliged
to do much more then that to ſerve you.</p>
            <p>2. My acquaintance with the forementioned bleſſed <hi>Jacob Behme</hi>
The <hi>Teutonick,</hi> was made about <hi>July</hi> in the year 1618. at<note n="*" place="margin">Lauben.</note> 
               <hi>Lauben</hi> in
my Native Country, by a Handicrafts-man a <hi>Taylour</hi> (now deceaſed,
called <hi>Libertus Schneller</hi>) who together with his Wives Brother a
<hi>young</hi> Preacher; by name <hi>Solomon Schroter;</hi> which were
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57413:29"/>
both <hi>Jacob Behm's</hi> and my good friends, and were his beloved faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſchollars, who were very <hi>diligent</hi> in his writings, and had
through <hi>Prayer</hi> attained an excellent knowledge therein from GOD.</p>
            <p>3. But I was <hi>Praeceptor</hi> or <hi>Turour to a Noble Mans Children at
Schweinitz called</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Balthazar Tilken. <hi>Schweintz.</hi>
               </note> Balthazar Tilken, and there ſeeing
he was an <hi>Oppoſer</hi> of <hi>Jacob Behme;</hi> I gat <hi>Adeo Contrariam
Mentem contra illum, ſo oppoſite a minde againſt him,</hi> God
forgive me in it, that I alſo became altogether averſe to him, and yet
ſuppoſed, that he <hi>ſtuck</hi> in or adhered to the Opinion of the<note n="†" place="margin">Calviniſts.</note> 
               <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi>
concerning Predeſtination, or the Election of God in his
Sonne, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4. Whereupon the <hi>two</hi> forementioned friends when at a time
the <hi>bleſſed</hi> Man came to them at <hi>Lauben,</hi> intreated ME to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and gave me occaſion and opportunity of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Conference <hi>with him,</hi> which, prayſed be our Deare God
for it, did ſo happily come about; that we become friends and laid
aſide all animoſity and <hi>misunderſtanding,</hi> and were united together
in Chriſtian brotherly Love.</p>
            <p>5. Where the bleſſed Man did beare in very <hi>wonderfull</hi> great
friendlineſs with my <hi>Academicall Turbulency</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
in ſuch Love, that for the ſake of the feare of God, I could
no longer reſiſt or oppoſe him, but muſt yeeld and give up my ſelf, to
the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Friendlineſs</hi> of the Spirit of JESUS CHRIST in him;
ſince which time I never ſpake with him or ſaw him any More.</p>
            <p>6. But <hi>De Actu Gerlicenſi concerning the proceedings at
Gerlitz,</hi> which I lately gave you an <hi>account</hi> of at N. I have received
<hi>true</hi> information of it from the forementioned <hi>faithfull</hi> friends: thus;
<hi>Antagoniſta Gerlicenſis ille qui ibidem Paſtor
<hi>Geweſen,</hi> His Antagoniſt at Gerlitz, who was Paſtour there,</hi> did
lend to one of <hi>Jacob Behmes</hi> Nephewes, a young <hi>Baker</hi>
who had lately married a Neece of <hi>Jacob Behmes.</hi> One<note n="*" place="margin">The value 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Doller</hi> for
his neceſſity, to buy wheate to bake white Bread at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> for
which he preſented him in Thankfulneſs, a good big <hi>White-Loafe;</hi>
and then ſoon after the <hi>Holy-dayes,</hi> he brought the <hi>Doller</hi> of
Money and payd it him againe; in hope the Preacher would for the
<hi>Intereſt</hi> of the Doller, accept of his former <hi>Preſent,</hi> in full ſatisfaction
being he uſed it but for a <hi>Fortnight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. But the <hi>Preacher</hi> unſatisfied, pronounced againſt him
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57413:29"/>
Gods Anger and terrible Curſe, and ſo vehemently terrifyed the
young <hi>Baker</hi> therewith, that he fell into very deepe perplexity
Melancholy and <hi>deſpaire</hi> of his <hi>Salvation,</hi> in that he had enraged the
<hi>Prieſt,</hi> and had ſuch a curſe or <hi>Anathema</hi> from him; ſo that for
the ſpace of ſeveral dayes he ſpake to No Body; nor would ſay what
hurt him, but went up and down <hi>ſighing</hi> and ſpeaking to himſelf
with Great perplexity; till at laſt upon the hearty entreaty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of his, WIFE her uncle <hi>Jacob Behme</hi> took the matter upon him:
and ſo friendly diſcourſed with the perplexed young Man, till he
found what lay upon him, and after he perceived it, he <hi>comforted</hi> him
and ſpake peace to him.</p>
            <p>8. And without diſcouragement he chearfully went to the enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>Preacher,</hi> and courteouſly entreated him, no longer to be an
gry with the young Man, but that he would be <hi>favourable</hi> to the
young Man, he would himſelf, for the young Mans ſake, ſatisfie
him, the enraged <hi>Preacher;</hi> what he deſired <hi>further</hi> for the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of
the <hi>Doller</hi> he lent him, and would willingly bring it to him, if he did
but know how much the <hi>Primate</hi> deſired: yet thought that the poore
young Man, according to his ability, had paid <hi>enough</hi> for it, yet if
he pleaſed to have any more, he would ſupply what he was wanting
in it.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Whereupon the</hi> Preacher <hi>with impatience brake forth; ſaying</hi>
what had that Raſcall (J. B.) to doe with him,
to diſquiet Moleſt and diſturb him? What
was that to him? he ſhould meddle with his own
buſineſs and be gone.</p>
            <p>10. But he <hi>continued</hi> his importunity, and entreated his favour
promiſing to make ſatisfaction, and give him content: But the
<hi>Primate,</hi> aſhamed of his injuſtice and <hi>wrong,</hi> would not acknowledg
it, Nor ſay, what he deſired, but ſtill continually bad this ſupplicant
or <hi>interpoſer</hi> to get him gone, and ſhewed him the <hi>outward Dore</hi> out
of which he was to get him gone.</p>
            <p>11. But the <hi>Primate</hi> ſat upon his chaire and had his <hi>Slippers</hi>
on, and when the Honeſt interpoſer humbly and meekly <hi>ſighing to
God,</hi> very lovingly, for his unſucceſsfull buſineſs went away; as he
was going out of the Dore, gave the Angry <hi>Primate</hi> a Chriſtian
<hi>valediction,</hi> ſaying, GOD <hi>preſerve your worſhip,</hi>
the Primate was angry at it, and becauſe off his bleſſing him was
much <hi>worſe</hi> then before; and took of his <hi>Slipper, and threw
it out at the honeſt Man,</hi> ſaying, <hi>what have you to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57413:30"/>
doe, thou wicked Rogue, to bid me or wiſh me a
good Night? what care I for thy Bleſſing? &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. But the Deare Man <hi>calmely</hi> took up the <hi>Slipper</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
it and <hi>laid</hi> it at his Feete againe, and ſaid: <hi>Sir! be not
angry I doe you no wrong, I commend you to God:</hi>
So at this time he departed from him.</p>
            <p>13. Till on <hi>Sunday</hi> following the <hi>Preacher</hi> in the
<hi>Pulpit,</hi> vehemently inveyed againſt the bleſſed Deare Man of God,
and thundred abominably and horribly againſt him by Name <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly</hi>
threatning the deſtruction of the whole City; exclaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him for a maker of uproares a <hi>ſeditious</hi> vaine fellow, and a
<hi>Heretick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. And admoniſhed them the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> in the preſence of the
Congregation, to be avenged againſt ſuch Tumultuous oppoſers of the
<hi>Holy Offi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e</hi> or <hi>Function</hi> of Preaching, <hi>who
diſturbed</hi> the Preacher, and moleſted him in his own Houſe:
and writes <hi>Hereticall Bookes,</hi> leaſt God be angry with them,
and in his Anger, cauſe the City to <hi>ſink</hi> and be ſwallowed up; as
was done at the Inſurrection of <hi>Corah Dathan and Abiram,</hi> who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>they and theirs with them muſt be ſwallowed up into the
Earth and goe into the</hi> Abyſſe <hi>of Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>15. Upon which the Innocent, and <hi>falſly accuſed</hi> Man, who
fate juſt at a <hi>Pillar</hi> right over againſt the Preaching <hi>Pulpit;</hi>
where he had his Seate, and heard it all with patience himſelf; held
his peace, till <hi>all the People</hi> were gone out of the Church, he ſtaying
all that while in his <hi>Seate;</hi> till the Preacher with his Chaplain or fellow
Officer, went out of the <hi>Veſtrey</hi> home through the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16. <hi>Then he followed them; and without in the</hi> Church-yard
<hi>ſpake to the Preacher friendly and Courteouſly and asked him,</hi>
what hurt he had done him; he could not
conceive with himſelf, that he had given him
one Evill word, prayed him in the preſence of
this worſhipfull Chaplaine who was there and
went along with him; to put him in Minde
of his fault, and Expreſſe it particularly, that
be might renounce it and repent, which he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57413:30"/>
would faine doe, if he did but know wherein
he bad transgreſſed.</p>
            <p>17. <hi>Whereupon the</hi> Preacher <hi>would anſwer nothing but looked
upon him as if he would</hi> kill him with his Lookes; <hi>and in a rage and
Fury burſt out beginning to</hi> Curſe <hi>and wrong him horribly ſaying:</hi>
Get the out from me <hi>Satan,</hi> tumble them into the
Abyſſe of Hell with thy diſturbance; canſt
thou not let me alone? muſt thou here raile
at me and moleſt me? doeſt thou not ſee
that I am a Spirituall Clergyman? <hi>pointing
at his habit or Black Prieſts Gowne,</hi> and goe
on in my Office.</p>
            <p>18. <hi>But the troubled and highly wronged Man, gave him this</hi> Anſwer
Yes worſhipfull Sir, I ſee well that you are a
ſpirituall, or Clergy man, and have heard at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively
in the Church; and have ſeen that
you have ſtood there in your <hi>Office,</hi> and doe
juſtly eſteem you without all further contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
for a ſpirituall or <hi>Clergy-man;</hi> and
I come therefore, and entreate you, <hi>AS</hi> a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
or <hi>Clergy-man;</hi> that you will tell me,
what hurt I have done you.</p>
            <p>19. <hi>And turning himſelf to the</hi> Other <hi>ſpirituall or</hi> Clergy-Man
<hi>the</hi> Chaplain, <hi>entreated him ſaying</hi> worſhipfull deare Sir,
help me I pray upon my earneſt intreaty to the
<hi>Preacher,</hi> that he would tell me in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
what I have ſpoken or done againſt him;
for which he was ſo vehement againſt me in
the Pulpit, and hath ſpoke to the Magiſtrate
to aveng it.</p>
            <p>20. Upon which, the <hi>Preacher</hi> was ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll more enraged; that
he would needs have ſent that ſervant he had behind him, for
<hi>a Serjeant</hi> or City Officer or Bayly, to <hi>Take him away</hi> and put him in
<hi>Priſon</hi> which the Chaplain ſpake againſt, and prevented it,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57413:31"/>
ſo that it was not done; and excuſed the Man, and bid him goe
home to his Houſe.</p>
            <p>21. The <hi>Munday</hi> Morning following, when the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi>
were met at the Councill houſe; and ſent for the <hi>falſe-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed</hi>
before them; they examined him, perceived <hi>no Evill</hi> in him,
they ſound no anger or diſlike neither in words or deeds or
<hi>behaviour,</hi> to proceed from him; nor did they obſerve any
thing that was <hi>blameable;</hi> they asked him <hi>what hurt he had
done to the</hi> Preacher? He anſwered, <hi>he knew not,
neither could he know from the Preacher
himſelf;</hi> and therefore intreated moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſively
and earneſtly; <hi>that they in their
wiſdomes would ſend for the</hi> Complainant <hi>or
Preacher, and cauſe him to ſay what he had
done to him!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>22. Upon which the <hi>whole Councill</hi> Concluded, that it was
juſt, that the Preacher ſhould be <hi>friendly entreated</hi> to come to them,
and required him particularly to ſignifie the <hi>Gravamina</hi>
or <hi>Grevances,</hi> and thereupon ſent <hi>Two Men</hi> of the <hi>Councill,</hi> Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
to the <hi>Preacher,</hi> and intreate him to come to them to the
Councell-houſe, or <hi>particularly</hi> to relate thoſe Grievances to the
<hi>Members</hi> ſent to HIM.</p>
            <p>23. <hi>Whereupon he was enraged, and ſent them word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
what had he to doe with their <hi>Judgement</hi>-houſe
<hi>or Councill</hi>-houſe; what he hath to ſay;
that he ſhall ſpeake in the place of <hi>God:</hi>
from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> there is his <hi>Councill</hi>-Throne
<hi>and</hi> Seate of his <hi>Profeſſion;</hi> what he hath
there ſaid; they ſhould follow that, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the vaine, wicked, reprobate <hi>Heretick</hi>
from the <hi>City,</hi> that he may no more oppoſe
the <hi>Holy</hi> office of Preaching; and bring the
puniſhment of <hi>Corah Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> upon
the whole City.</p>
            <p>24. Accordingly the Lords <hi>conſulted,</hi> and could not finde
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57413:31"/>
how they ſhould <hi>juſtly</hi> help the Maſter; ſcaring the vehemency
of their, Preacher in his <hi>Pulpit;</hi> and concluded to <hi>baniſh</hi>
the Innocent <hi>Jacob Behme</hi> out of the City, in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
ſome Men of the Councill would NOT conſent, but roſe
and went their way, but the Reſt <hi>execute,</hi> and by the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
or City officers, cauſe the <hi>uncondemned</hi> faithfull Citizen, to
be <hi>inſtantly</hi> baniſhed out of the <hi>Gates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>25. <hi>Which the patient</hi> bleſſed <hi>Man diſliked NOT; but anſwered,</hi>
in the Name of God, my Lords, I will doe
as you command and depart the City, but
may I not goe to my houſe firſt, and take
mine along with me, or at leaſt tell them
my neceſſity? but they forbad it and denyed
him, ſaying they could not alter the Sentence,
which the whole Councill had concluded, in
which he inſtantly was to be led from the
Councill-houſe out of the City, with deriſion
and ſcorne; <hi>then he ſaid:</hi> Deare Sirs, let
it be done ſeeing it cannot be otherwiſe; I
am contented; <hi>ſo he was</hi> baniſhed <hi>and gone
away all</hi> Night-<hi>long.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>26. But the <hi>Morning following,</hi> when the <hi>Councill</hi> were
<hi>met</hi> together againe, and had reconciled their <hi>diſagreement,</hi> they
made another concluſion, to hunt <hi>after</hi> the perſecuted Innocent
Man, and ſent up and downe about the <hi>Country</hi> to ſeeke him,
and at length found him, and brought him ſolemnely with
<hi>honour</hi> into the City againe, which was a <hi>wonder</hi> from
God, in the Midſt of thoſe Acts and <hi>Decrees</hi> of the Devill.</p>
            <p>27. Thus much is what I am certainly informed, that it was
ſo done.</p>
            <p>28. Concerning the <hi>Acts</hi> or proceedings at <hi>Dresden.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dresden</note>
I know alſo and can certainly affirme, <hi>authoritate alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
ſide Dignorum, &amp; exceptione majorum;
upon the authority of others worthy of beleefe, and without exceptions;
that</hi> the <hi>Bleſſed</hi> Man of God as a Hinde hunted out and In, was
Cited to <hi>Dresden:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>29. And was examined in the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:57413:32"/>
of the Illuſtrious <hi>Prince Elector,</hi> by
the Chief Doctors aſſembled together, whoſe
names were as followeth; <hi>Dr. Hoe, Dr. Meiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
Dr. Baldwine, Dr. Gerrard, Dr. Leiſern,</hi>
and <hi>one Doctor</hi> more, which I cannot name
at preſent, and <hi>Two Profeſſors</hi> of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks,
and appointed to diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his <hi>writings;</hi> alſo in ſeverall wayes,
ſet upon him with all ſorts of <hi>Theologicall
Philoſophicall</hi> and <hi>Mathematicall</hi> Queſtions,
but not overcome by any of them nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
by any of them, but ſo readily
aptly and diſtinctly anſwered thoſe Examiners,
that they ſaid not one ill word to him.</p>
            <p>30. But the <hi>Illuſtrious</hi> Prince Electour
HIGHLY <hi>Wondred</hi> at it, and deſired to know
the Concluſion of their <hi>Cenſure;</hi> but they
the Doctors and Examinours, excuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and intreated the <hi>Illuſtrious</hi> Prince
Electour, that he would have <hi>Patience;</hi> til
the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Man ſhould be more plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Cleered</hi> to them; they could not <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi>
him; but hoped he would hereafter
more cleerely be apprehended by them, and
then they might and would give their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but as yet they could not.</p>
            <p>31, And THEN the deepely Grounded <hi>divinely</hi> bleſſed <hi>Man</hi>
asked them againe ſeverall <hi>Queſtions,</hi> which they were to
<hi>Anſwer</hi> him in, with plaine diſtinction, not unwillingly, nor
very Earneſtly, but <hi>Occaſionally</hi> as it were, becauſe they had
heard ſuch <hi>Greate Things</hi> from ſuch a ſimple Lay Man, beyond
THEIR Apprehenſion and not able to underſtand him; but did
not upbraid him, but unexpectedly the ſimple Man
<pb facs="tcp:57413:32"/>
held forth to the Theologiſts, the Truth
plainly, and diſtinguiſhed from the Fictions,
he <hi>Honoured them</hi> with <hi>Great Reſpect,</hi> and
diſcourſed friendly with them, touched all
their Errors, and ſhewed them as with a Finger
the Originalls of them.</p>
            <p>32. But to the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> he ſaid <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly,</hi>
Deare Sirs, obſerve, thus farre is the
skill of your <hi>Mathematicks</hi> right, exact, and
grounded upon the Myſteries of Nature; but
whatſoever is beyond that, viz. <hi>this</hi> and <hi>this,</hi>
are <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> additions, the Ignorance and
blindneſs of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> which we <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
are not to follow.</p>
            <p>33. So they left him quietly, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed
him in peace; alſo the <hi>Illuſtrious
Prince</hi> Electour, <hi>had greate</hi> ſatisfaction <hi>in his</hi>
Anſwers; <hi>He required him to come to him apart by</hi>
HIMSELF, and ſpake with him about <hi>all</hi>
Sorts of ſecret <hi>Myſteries,</hi> and admitted
him to him in all Favour, and Gave him
liberty to goe to his houſe at <hi>Gerlitz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>34. I cannot remember that I have heard <hi>certainly</hi> more
thereof, but I lately heard the <hi>Two D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>, D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Meiſner,

Other</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Meiſner anſwered him, nor I neither,
my brother, who knoweth what may lye hidden

it be right, black or white, God convert the
Man if he be in an Errour; and keepe us to
his divine Truth, and give us to underſtand
that further and better, alſo a Minde and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
to expreſs it, and propagate it to
our ability; <hi>beſides this ſomewhat was ſaid, but I went away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>36, <hi>Another time, I</hi> heard <hi>the Reverend</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi>

deſired neither to Judge, nor procure that the
Man ſhould be condemned or ſuppreſſed, or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced,
he is a Man indued with wonderfull high
Gifts of the Spirit, which a Man can yet neither
condemne nor approve.</p>
