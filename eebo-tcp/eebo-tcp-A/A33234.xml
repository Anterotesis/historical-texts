            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Knights, Citizens, and
Burgesses of the House of
Commons to present to your
Lordships a great and crying
grievance, which though it be
complayned of in the present pressures, but by
the northern parts, yet by the Logick and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of it, it is the grievance of the whole
Kingdome. The Court of the Presidents, and
Counsell of the North, or as it is more usually
called, the Courts of Yorke, which by the
spirit and ambition of the Ministers, truste<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
there, or by the naturall Inclination of Courts
to inlarge their owne power and Iurisdiction,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93092:3"/>
hath so prodigiously brake downe the bankes
of the first Councell, in which it ranne, that it
hath almost over-whelmed that Countrey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Sea of Arbitrary power, and involved
the people in a Laberynth of distemper, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and poverty.</p>
            <p>Your Lordships will give mee leave not
with presumption to informe your great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
but that you may know what
moved the house of Commons to their resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to remember your Lordships of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and erecting this Court, and of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
and growth of it.</p>
            <p>Your Lordships well know, that upon the
suppression of all religious houses to such a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew
in the 27 yeare of <hi>H.</hi> 8. from that time to
the thirtieth yeare of that Kings raigne, many
(not fewer then sixe Insurrections) and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
were made in the Northerne parts, under
pretence of that quarrell, most of them under
the command of some eminent person of that
Countrey, the which being quieted before the
end of the thirtieth yeare, that great King well
knowing his owne mind, and what hee meant
to doe with the great Houses of Religion; in
the yeare following for prevention of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
that might ensue to him upon such
distemper, in the 31. yeare of his Reign granted
a Commission to the Bishop of <hi>Landaffe,</hi> the
first President, and others for the quiet go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93092:3"/>
of the County of <hi>Yorke, Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,
Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmerland,</hi> the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke
of <hi>Durham,</hi> the counties of the Cities of
<hi>Yorke, Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Hull,</hi> and <hi>New-castle</hi> upon
<hi>Tyne.</hi> But my Lords this Commission was no
other then a Commission of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi>
onely it had a clause at the end of it, for the
hearing of all causes reall and person, <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
ambae partes, vel altera pars sic gravata pauperta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
fuerit, quod quomodo vis suum secundum legem
Regni nostri, aliter persequi non possit,</hi> which
clause how illegall soever, for that it is illegall
and voyd in Law, little doubt can be made yet
whether they exercise that part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
at all, or so sparingly exercised it, that
poore people found ease and benefit by it. I
know not, but at that time I find no complaint
against it, till the comming in of King <hi>Iames</hi> the
Commission continued still the same, and that
in the first yeare of his Reigne to the Lord
<hi>Sheffeild</hi> varied no otherwise from the former,
saue, onely it had reference to Instructions
which should be sent, though any new sent or
no is uncertaine, but wee can find none.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Iune,</hi> in the seventh yeare of the Reigne
of King <hi>Iames</hi> a new Commission was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the same man (the Lord <hi>Sheffeild</hi>) very
differing from all that went before, it being
left out, that they should enquire <hi>per sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
bonorum &amp; legalium hominum,</hi> and to heare
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93092:4"/>
determine <hi>secundum leges Angliae,</hi> Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
had onely to the Instructions, which were
the first Instructions, wee can find were sent
thither, though I told your Lordships there
were some mentions of some In 1. I shall not
trouble your Lordships with these Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
nor with the other that followed in 14.
<hi>Iacobi</hi> to the same man, nor in 16. <hi>Iacobi,</hi> when
a new Commission was granted to my Lord
<hi>Sunderland,</hi> nor indeed with any till we come
to these present Instructions, and Commissions
under which that part of the Kingdome groans
and languisheth.</p>
            <p>My Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi> came to that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Decemb. 4. Caroli,</hi> and since the
Commission hath beene three severall times
removed, in the fift yeare in <hi>March,</hi> in the
eighth in <hi>Novemb.</hi> in the thirteenth yeare of his
Majesties raigne into that Commission of 8. and
13. a new clause served in for the granting, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questring,
and establishing Possessions accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to instructions, crowded in a Masse of new
exorbitant and intollerable power, though our
complaint be against this Commission it selfe,
and against the whole body of those instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
I shall not mispend your Lordships pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
time in desiring to have the whole read,
but shall presume to trouble your Lordships
only with five or six of the instructions,
that by the vast irregularity of those your
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93092:4"/>
Lordships may judge, how insupportable the
whole burthen is. I shall not trouble your
Lordships with the ninth Instruction, though it
be but short, which introduceth that, <hi>miseram
servitatem, ubi jus est vagum, &amp; incognitum,</hi> by
requiring an obedience to such ordinances, and
determinations, as be or shall bee made by the
Councell Table, or high Commission Court.
A grievance my Lords, howsoever <hi>consuetudo
&amp; peccantum claritas nobilitaverit han<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> culpam,</hi> of
so transcendent a nature, that your Lordships
noble Iustice wil provide a remedy for it, with
no lesse care, then you would rescue the life
and blood of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Reade the 19. 22, 23, 24. 29. and 30. I will
not trouble your Lordships with reading
more, there being among them in the whole
58. Instructions, scarce one that is not against,
or besides the Law.</p>
            <p>Whether His Majestie may caution out a part
of his Kingdome to be tryed by Commission,
though according to the rules of Law, since
the whole Kingdome is under the Lawes and
government of the Courts established at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister,</hi>
and by this reason the severall parts of
the Kingdome may bee deprived of that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
will not bee now the question; that his
Majestie cannot by Commission erect a new
court of Chancery, or a proceeding according
to the rules of the Star-chamber, as most clear
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93092:5"/>
to all who have read <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> which
allowed no proceedings, <hi>nisi per legale judicium
parium</hi> &amp; <hi>per legem terrae:</hi> for our court of
Chancery heare by long usage and proscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is growne to bee as it were <hi>lex terra.</hi> But my
Lords, the thirtieth Instruction goes further,
and erects such an Emprie, such a Dominion,
as shall bee lyable to no contrary.</p>
            <p>The Courts of <hi>Westminster,</hi> my Lords have
superintendences over all inferiour Courts to
regulate their jurisdictions, if they exceed their
limits. As to hold Plea of greater valew,
or the like in his exercise of Iurisdiction, the
Iudges are sworne to grant, and send prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and to stop the granting of these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitlons,
or to neglect them, when they are
granted, is the greatest and boldest scorne of
the Law, and the Law-makers that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
            <p>The Kings Courts at <hi>Westminster,</hi> having bin
alwayes of that awefull and reverent esteeme,
with inferiour Iudges, that the Instances of
such contempts against them are very rare and
exemplary in the punishment.</p>
            <p>The Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> in Trinity Terme,
in the twentieth yeare of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, in
<hi>Rot.</hi> 289 in the common Pleas in <hi>Hillary</hi> Terme
21. in the Kings Bench, was attached for diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
a prohibition at the sute of <hi>Stracill,</hi> upon
full and solemne dissension of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93092:5"/>
the Court resolved, that the proceedings
of the Bishop were in <hi>obedientiam &amp; diminuco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem
Domini, &amp; potestatis Regiae authoritatis suae
lectionem &amp; coronae suae exhereditationem manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum,
&amp;c.</hi> As the words of the Records are,
and therefore adjudged the temporall tyes of
the Bishop to be seised into the Kings hand, and
great, verely great dammages to bee paid to
Plaintiffes: And whosoever gave directions
for these stout Instructions, might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
that no longer since then <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
in the seventh yeare of <hi>Eliz. Rot.</hi> 31. An
Attachment was graunted against the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Yorke</hi> then President of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
for forbidding the Goaler of <hi>Yorke</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
one <hi>Lambert</hi> his Prisoner, who was sent
for by a <hi>habeas corpus</hi> from the Kings Bench,
and if they would have believed the resolution
of all the Iudges in <hi>England,</hi> in Trinity Term,
in the 6. yeare of King <hi>Iames,</hi> they would have
knowne how unfit it had beene to enlarge that
Iurisdiction, since most of their proceedings
being of an inferiour nature to what they are
now growne, were then declared to be illegall
&amp; inconsistant with the liberty of the Subject.</p>
            <p>And can such a court, as this my Lords de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to live? what a compendious abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath <hi>Yorke</hi> gotten of all the courts in
<hi>Westminster</hi> Hall, whatsoever fals within the
cognizance, orjurisdiction of either courts here
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93092:6"/>
is compleatly determinable within, that one
Court at <hi>Yorke,</hi> besides the power it hath with
the Ecclesiasticall and high Commission
courts.</p>
            <p>What hath the good Northern people
done, that they onely must be disfranchised
of all their priviledges by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and
the Petition of right, for to what purpose
serve these Statutes, if they may be fined and
imprisoned without Law, according to the
discretion of the Commissioners, what have
they done, that they, and they alone of all the
people of this happy I land must be disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of their birth-right, of their Inheritance.
For prohibitions, writs of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> writs
of erour are the birth-right, the inheritance of
the Subjects.</p>
            <p>And 'tis here worth your Lordships obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that to those many prohibitions, which
have beene granted from above, for till of
late, the court of <hi>Yorke</hi> had not the courage to
dispose prohibitions, nor indeed till our
courts here, had not the courage to grant them.
T was never knowne, that court pleaded the
Iurisdiction of their counsell, which without
doubt they would have done upon the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of many great persons, in whose prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
they have alwayes beene, had they not
knowne the Law, could not be misinterpreted
enough to allow it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:93092:6"/>Your Lordships remember the directions
I mentioned of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> that all procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
shall be <hi>per legale Iudicium parium, &amp; per
legem terrae,</hi> now these Jurisdictions tell you,
you shall proceed according to your discretion
that is, you shall doe what your please, onely
that wee may not suspect this discretion will
be gentler and kinder to us then the Lawe:
speciall provision is made no fine, no punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall be lesse then by the Law is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
by no meanes, but as much greater, as
your discretion shall thinke fit; and indeed in
this Improvement wee find: Arbitrary courts
are very pregnant, if the Law requires my
good behaviour, this discretion makes mee
close Prisoner, if the Law sets me upon the
Pillory, this discretion appoints me to leave
my eares there.</p>
            <p>But this proceeding according to discretion
is no new expression, twas in the first commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
I told your Lordships of in the 31. <hi>Hen</hi> 8.
that they should proceed <hi>secundum legem et con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudinem

For <hi>talis discretio</hi> (sayes the Law) <hi>discretion<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

confundit:</hi> and such a confusion hath this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
in these Instructions produced, as if
discretion were onely removed from rage and
fury, no inconvenience, no mischiefe, no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
that the malice or insolence, or curiosity
of these commissioners had a mind to bring
upon that people, but through the latitude and
power of this discretion the poore people
have felt this discretion, hath beene the quicke
sound which hath swallowed up their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
their liberty: I beseech your Lordships
rescue them from this discretion.</p>
            <p>Besides, the charge that this Court is to
his Majesty, which is neere 1300. l. <hi>per annum,</hi>
your Lordships will easily guesse, what an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable
burthen the many officers (whose
places are of great valew) the Atturnies,
Clarkes, Registers, and above 1000 Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
that attend the Courts, must bee to that
people (insomuch) that in truth the whole
countrey seemes to be divided into the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Dependants upon that Court: And
the people upon whom these Officers of that
Court prey and commit rapines, as he said in
<hi>Patronius, Omnes hic aut captantur, aut captunt;
aut cadavere quae laterentur, aut corni quae laterunt.</hi>
Truly my Lords, these vexed worne-people
of the North are not sutors to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
to regulate this Court, or to reforme
the Iudges of it, but for extripating these
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93092:7"/>
Iudges, and the utter abolishing this Court,
they are of <hi>Catoes</hi> mind, who would not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to <hi>Caesar</hi> for his life, saying, he would not
be beholding to a Tyrant for injustice, for it
was injustice in him to take upon him to save a
mans life, over whom hee had no power.</p>
            <p>So these Gentlemen desire not to be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this Court hereafter for injustice. The
very administration of injustice, founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such illegall principles being a grievance
and oppression to the subject.</p>
            <p>First upon the whole matter the house of
Commons is of opinion, that the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Instructions whereby the Resident
and Counsell of the North, exercise a Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
is illegall, both in the creation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that it is improfitable to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
for besides so much neere thirteene
hundred pound taken out of His Majesties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues,
every yeare His Majestie looseth the
great benefit would accrew to him upon writs
and upon Fines, upon Out-lawes, and other
profits, which redound to his Majestie out of
his Court here.</p>
            <p>And which I had almost forgot to tell your
Lordships of, that his Majesty may bee sure
to have benefit from that Court (nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
care is taken, by the fifty three Instructions,
that if any money remaines over and above
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93092:8"/>
all disbursements, it shall be bestowed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
Houshold-stuffe, and furniture for the
house, where the Lord President and Counsell
use to be.</p>
            <p>And lastly, that it is inconvenient and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to His Majesties subjects of those parts.</p>
            <p>And therefore they are humble Sutors to
your Lordships, and the house of commons,
on this behalfe, that since this people doe and
have in all matters of duty and affection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with the best of His Majesties subjects,
that they may not be distinguished from them
in the manner of His Majesties Iustice and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
since this court originally instituted
and continued by his Majesty, for the ease and
benefit of his subjects, is apparently inverted
to the burthen and discomfort of them that
your Lordships will joyne with, the House of
commons in beseeching His Majesty, that
the present commission may be revoked, and
no more such granted for the future.</p>
