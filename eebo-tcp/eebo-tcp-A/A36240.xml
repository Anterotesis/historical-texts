            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Concerning the Caſe of taking the New Oath of
FEALTY and ALLEGIANCE
With a DECLARATION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Gentlemen concerned in this Caſe,
profeſſing ſtill to adhere to the Doctrines
formerly Profeſſed and Practiſed in our
Church, they cannot take it for a begging of
Principles, if we reaſon with them on thoſe
ſame Principles which themſelves have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
owned, and which they are unwilling
to have it ſo much as thought they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.
It will therefore concern them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
whether their Old Notions be any way
conſiſtent with this New Declaration?</p>
            <p>The Declaration is, that they Conceive,
That all that the Oath obliges them to, is to
live peaceably under the preſent Government.
If they will mean fairly and ſincerely, they
muſt neceſſarily intend Two things: 1. That,
Though they do not think themſelves obliged
to be active in Maintaining the Government
in its preſent poſſeſſion, in Oppoſition to the
K. <hi>de jure,</hi> yet they promiſe at leaſt, not to
diſturb the Government in poſſeſſion, and
therefore never to be active in Aſſiſting even
the K. <hi>de jure,</hi> againſt it. That they muſt
mean this, if they mean veraciouſly, is plain
from the whole deſign of impoſing this New
Oath, in our preſent Circumſtances, which is,
with a particular and a principal regard to the
K. <hi>de jure,</hi> that the Swearers may ſecure the
Poſſeſſors in Oppoſition to him. And the Oath
is deſignedly contrived in ſuch general terms
as may reach all the Caſes that may fall out
during the whole life of the K. <hi>de jure,</hi> at leaſt
whileſt his Competitors are living alſo. And
therefore the Swearers muſt mean, not only
at preſent, but neither alſo for the future, to
aſſiſt the K. <hi>de jure</hi> againſt his preſent Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors,
if they will mean what is expected
from them by the Impoſers of the Oath, that
is, if they will mean really, as in honeſty they
ought to be preſumed to mean. And 2. They
muſt intend not only to abſtain from real di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances
of the Peace (for that might be
conſiſtent with endeavours to reſtore the K.
<hi>de jure,</hi> as the only means of ſetling a Peace on
ſolid and laſting Foundations) but from ſuch
things alſo as ſhall be called and voted diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
of the Peace by the preſent Poſſeſſors.
For the deſign of the Oath being to ſatisfie
the Poſſeſſors, the Swearers ought to mean it
ſo, as that it may in reaſon give them the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
deſired by it. But the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Oath by any others can never be
meant by the Impoſers. And it certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Party concerned to interpret pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
made to ſatisfie himſelf, eſpecially when
he is a Governour. Then it may be preſumed
notorious what is meant by breaking the
Peace. That is, whatſoever it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
will be Judged a breach of Peace by
them who are already poſſeſſed of all the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Tribunals in the Execution of thoſe Laws
which were never deſigned by the Legiſlators,
for the ſupport of the Government <hi>de Facto,</hi>
which were not alſo <hi>de Jure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore the Swearers can indeed and
veraciouſly mean theſe things now mentioned,
I ſhall then confeſs that they may <hi>bonâ fide</hi>
take the Oath with the annexed Declaration.</p>
            <p>But it will then deſerve a further enquiry
whether the Duty of their former Oaths be
conſiſtent with ſuch a meaning? That is,
Whether their Oaths to the K. <hi>de jure,</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51233:2"/>
with a Neutrality? that is, Whether
they do not oblige them to be Active in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
towards his Reſtauration? For we
have now to deal as I ſaid, with ſuch perſons
as own themſelves ſtill obliged by their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Oaths. Such all muſt be who ſtand by
Bp. <hi>Sanderſon</hi>'s Principles, ſo much magnified
by them who differ extremely from him in
their Application. And ſuch muſt All be who
ſtand by the Practices of our Fathers in <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s
days, who did not think that either
<hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Poſſeſſion, or K. <hi>Ch</hi>'s diſability to
protect them, did any way excuſe them from
their Obligations to K. <hi>Ch.</hi>
the II. though
neither he had taken any Coronation Oath to
them, nor they any Oath to Him, otherwiſe
than he was included in the Lawful Succeſſors
of his Royal Anceſtors to whom they had
Sworn. Let us therefore ſee whether theſe
former Oaths did not Oblige them who took
them, to be Active for the Intereſts of the
Prince to whom they were made. If they did,
Two things will thence follow againſt the
ſenſe of theſe Swearers: 1. That theſe New
Oaths being made to our New Poſſeſſors with
the ſame deſign, and in the ſame ſenſe of the
words already known from ancient Practice,
muſt alſo oblige them to be Active for our
preſent Poſſeſſors, which themſelves will not
excuſe from Perjury, if the action be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
deſigned againſt the K. <hi>de Jure.</hi> 2. That,
on the ſame parity of Reaſoning, the ſame
Oaths being made to the excluded K. <hi>de Jure,</hi>
will alſo oblige Swearers to be Active for him,
which muſt neceſſarily oblige them to do that
which the Poſſeſſors will certainly judge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with what they have Sworn to
them, that is, with living peaceably under
their Government.</p>
            <p>And if we were to decide this Queſtion by
the Practice and Precedent of our Church in
the laſt Caſe, that now mentioned one of
<hi>Cromwell</hi>; it ſeems plain, that our Brethren
then thought their Oaths to the Royal Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obliged them to be Active, when a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
occaſion ſhould ſerve, and not only to a
bare Neutrality. What ſhould otherwiſe have
hindred them from taking the Engagement,
when they might thereby have ſo much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
their own condition in this world, if
they might have done it without prejudicing
their condition in the next? The ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
that are made uſe of now, were as
truely appliable then. The Government was
then alſo already ſetled without K. and Houſe
of Lords, without any Sin of the Royal Party,
from whom this ſecurity was required for the
future. K. <hi>Ch.</hi> the II. was as unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
them as K. <hi>J.</hi> II. is now. The probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of their being likely to be in any Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of Contributing to the Reſtauration with
any likelyhood of ſucceſs, was then as little
as it is now. And therefore, ſuppoſing that
to be the only Caſe wherein the Actual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of their Oaths for active Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would return, as many of them do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
yet the taking of the Engagement had
been much leſs Culpable than the taking of
This preſent Oath is now. The only Condition
that can make it lawful for us to promiſe we
will never do that which, in ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
we think our ſelves obliged to do, can
only be the aſſurance we have at the making
of the Promiſe, that thoſe Circumſtances
which may reduce the Obligation ſhall never
return upon us. And therefore by how much
the more or leſs probable the returning of
thoſe Circumſtances is, by ſo much the more
a Promiſe or an Oath not to do what in thoſe
Circumſtances we are obliged to do, will alſo
be more or leſs excuſable. But whilſt the
Controverſie is depending, whilſt the Right
is on Legal (and Ch. of <hi>Engl.</hi>) Principles,
unqueſtionable there can be no excuſe for
Promiſing or Swearing not to do that which,
in ſo little and not unlikely a change of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
we may notwithſtanding think
our ſelves obliged to do.</p>
            <p>They ſay indeed, and ſay truly that even
their former Oaths could not oblige them
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51233:2"/>
to Impoſſibilities; That even the Legiſlators
and Impoſers of them cannot in reaſon be
preſumed to have obliged the Subject to an
active aſſiſtance that ſhould certainly ruine
himſelf without any probability of being Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to the Government; that therefore
there can be no obligation for ſingle Subjects
to oppoſe a K. <hi>de facto,</hi> who is once eſtabliſhed
in a full and compleat Poſſeſſion; that in ſuch
a caſe it muſt therefore be lawful to live quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that when it is lawful to live ſo, it muſt
alſo be lawful to Promiſe and to Swear to
live ſo. This Reaſoning would indeed be
very good, if the Promiſe and the Oath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
no further than the Caſe ſuppoſed in
the Argument, that is, if their Promiſe and
Oath were no longer to forbear active endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to reſtore the K. <hi>de jure,</hi> then their
endeavours were deſtitute of any proſpect of
any probability of Succeſs, or of any other
publick advantage that might make amends
for the hazard to which they muſt thereby
neceſſarily expoſe themſelves. But if they
would ſpeak out, and expreſs the limitation
intended, how could they expect that ſuch a
taking the Oath could ever be accepted by
the Impoſers? Why ſhould they thank them
for Swearing no more than what they muſt
have been obliged to, though they had never
ſworn it, by the dictates of common pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and their natural concernment for
their own preſervation. Why ſhould they
thank them for qualifying themſelves for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
by ſeeming theirs when there was no
need of them, and at the ſame time owning
an Obligation to leave and betray them in
the very Caſe in proſpect of which the Oath
it ſelf was deſigned, that is, in the time of
danger, and danger from that very Enemy
againſt whom the Impoſers expected to be
ſecured by this Oath? If they go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the caſe ſuppoſed, they can never
give the Government <hi>de Facto</hi> that ſecurity
that is expected. If they Swear and Promiſe
more, that will be more than they can juſtifie
by their own Principles, who both ſuppoſe
their former Oaths to remain as obligatory
now as ever, and to require more than an
indifferent Neutrality, and to require active
Endeavours for reſtoring the K. <hi>de jure,</hi> when
ever they may attempt it with any probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Succeſs. Such, though they do not
think themſelves obliged to endeavour it at
preſent, yet cannot promiſe, much leſs Swear,
that for the future, they will never endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
it.</p>
            <p>This was the ſenſe of our Anceſtors, and
is the ſenſe of our Brethren, with whom we
are at preſent dealing. But we will not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them to continue any longer of the ſame
mind than their own Principles oblige them.
Let us therefore ſee whether their other
Principles do not oblige them to believe the
Inconſiſtency of their preſent and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Oaths. Indeed, if by living peaceably
they mean no more than Non-oppoſition, a
perfect Neutrality would ſatisfie the Oaths
on both ſides, both to the K. <hi>de facto</hi> and to
the K. <hi>de jure</hi> alſo. By not contributing to
the War againſt the K. <hi>de jure,</hi> they would
ſatisfie their old Oaths; and withal by not
contributing to the Reſtoration of the K. <hi>de
jure,</hi> they would ſatisfie their new Oaths to
the K. <hi>de facto.</hi> But it is ſtrange how they
can fall into ſuch a miſtake as this is. There
is no doubt but the Poſſeſſor, whoever he be,
will never be content with a bare Neutrality,
but will expect active aſſiſtances from his
liege Subjects, and this by vertue of their
Allegiance and their Oaths. If they do not
ſerve him in their own perſons, they muſt
at leaſt do it by their Contributions for the
maintaining others to do that duty for them.
And what reaſon can they give, why Allegiance
ſworn to a K. <hi>de facto,</hi> ſhould ſignifie more,
than the ſame Allegiance when ſworn to a
K. <hi>de jure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us lay aſide the Opinions of Men,
and conſider nakedly the things themſelves.
The things ſworn in both Oaths are Fealty
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51233:3"/>
and Allegiance, Terms taken from the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Feudal Laws, and with them moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
ſignifying, not a Neutrality, but an
active Contribution. <hi>Feudum</hi> among them,
upon which the Oath of Fidelity was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
ſignified a Tenure of Lands by the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiary
from the favour of the Benefactor, the
Liege Lord, on which account the Tenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
his Liege-man or Vaſſal. And can we
think that all this Endearment and Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was deſigned to hire them only to a Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality?
No, it is plain they intended thereby
to oblige them to all that gratitude that might
in Reaſon be expected from Perſons ſo behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to them for their worldly maintenance.
The Duty was very much the ſame as between
the <hi>Liberti</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Patrons. For here,
as well as there, was allowed an action of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
only with this difference, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
among the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Perſon convicted of
Ingratitude was reduced into his former ſtate
of ſlavery, here the Tenure, which alone was
ſervile, the Perſon being free, was forfeited on
that Conviction. The Vaſſal therefore was
obliged to help his Lord in all wars
wherein he thought the Cauſe was
juſt, or at leaſt, doubted whether it
might not be ſo.<note place="margin">Feud. L. 1. Tit. 5. l. 11. Tit. 24. 28.</note> This in caſe of
offenſive Wars. In defenſive wars
he was to help him, whatever the
Cauſe was, without Exception. Nay, if the
Lord were beſieged, and by that means diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to protect him, the Vaſſal was yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to uſe all his endeavours to reſtore him
to his liberty. If he did not, that was alſo an
Ingratitude that forfeited his Tenure. And
therefore the doing of it muſt undoubtedly
have been a condition of it, and therefore a
a particular of the Oath he was to take to his
Liege Lord for the performance of Conditions.
This was the caſe in thoſe Feudatory Tenures
for which the Feudal Laws in the Body of
the Civil Law were framed by the Modern
Empire. Much more of the Fees depending
on the Emperor himſelf, from <hi>whom</hi> theſe
inferior Feudal Lords derived their
Authority, and that with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
exception of ſuch caſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they might any way interfere
with it.<note place="margin">Feud. l. 11. tit. 7.</note> And certainly the Rights of the
Empire by theſe barbarous Feudal Laws are
common to the Emperour with all other So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Princes where the ſame Feudal Laws
have obtained, (as they have done generally
in theſe Northern Countreys) but moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to ſuch as thoſe of our Kingdoms whoſe
very Crowns are called Imperial.</p>
            <p>Fealty in the new Oath is called Faith,
and ſo it is by the Feudaliſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with particular regard to the
Etymology of <hi>Feudum.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Feud. l. 11. tit. 3.</note> As if this
Fealty were eſſential to the very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Feudal Tenure. But it is certain this
Fealty required more than an empty Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
So the Collector of the Books
<hi>de Feudis</hi> tells us in expreſs Terms:<note place="margin">ib. tit. 6.</note>
               <hi>Sed quia non ſufficit abſtinere à malo
niſi fiat quod bonum eſt, reſtat ut in ſex prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictis</hi>
(what thoſe are may be ſeen in the
place) <hi>conſilium &amp; auxilium Domino praeſtet,
ſi beneficio vult dignus videri, &amp; de Fidelitate
eſſe ſalvus.</hi> And it appears in all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
promiſed and ſworn to, in all the Oaths
of Fealty and Allegiance. Such are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
all the ſecrets of the Lord, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
all conſpiracies againſt him. Such are
alſo the maintaining and defending his life and
limbs and terrene honour. Theſe things are
generally expreſly mentioned in all the Oaths
of thoſe times, in all the places and Nations
where-ever the Feudal Laws obtained, by
which we may eaſily gather that they are not
ſingular caſes ſeparable from the Nature of
Feudal Tenure in general. And therefore
where-ever Fealty and Allegiance are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and ſworn in general, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
mention of any particulars; As we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſo abſurd as to think no particulars are
intended, (which would make the whole
Oath inſignificant) ſo neither can we doubt,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51233:3"/>
but if any were, theſe certainly were ſo. And
ſo it always appeared in practice. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
had ſworn Fealty and Allegiance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mentioning any particulars, was notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
called to an account, and deprived of
his Fee, if it could be proved againſt him,
that he had violated any of the particulars
now mentioned. And that this maintenance
of life, and limb, and terrene honour was
meant of doing it in an active way, will the
more eaſily appear, if we conſider that this
was originally a Military Tenure. It was
the Tenure of a <hi>Miles</hi> in that <hi>Italian</hi> colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
incorporated into the Civil Imperial
Laws. It is Knight-ſervice with us, of the
Fenſible men, in the Civilian language of
<hi>Scotland.</hi> The Feudatory was obliged to keep
a Coat of Arms, and to maintain his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of Soldiers to be commanded by the
Liege Lord, as often as he had occaſion for
them. This I take to be the original of our
Coats of Armour, that uſed anciently to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn
our Gentlemen's Halls, that they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the number of Men at Arms, that
their Feudatory Tenants were bound to find
them, and they to find their Soveraign Lord
the King, when required by him. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
ſervice was generally expected at firſt,
which made it more difficult for Women to
be admitted to this Tenure then. However
contribution of the Purſe towards the Hire
of Soldiers to perform the duty for them was
indiſpenſibly expected from all. By which
we eaſily underſtand how far a neutrality is
from ſatisfying the duty of it.</p>
            <p>And now it will concern our well-meaning
Brethren to conſider whether this ſame Feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thus explained as ſworn to a K. <hi>de Facto,</hi>
and a K <hi>de Jure,</hi> be any way conſiſtent. Is
it poſſible for them to maintain the life and
limbs and terrene Honour of the K. <hi>de Jure,</hi>
without oppoſing the K. <hi>de Facto,</hi> at the very
time when he deprives the K. <hi>de Jure</hi> of his
terrene Honour? whilſt he is engaged in an
actual War againſt him, not only to maintain
the Honour he has deprived him of, but to
put him alſo to further hazards of his life and
limbs? Will not the Law call all ſuch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing
the Title of a Rival Prince, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in his peace, a breach of his peace whom
the Law calls our Soveraign Lord the K?
And will not, on the other ſide, the ſame
Laws, as expounded by the Tribunals of the
K. <hi>de facto,</hi> condemn all peaceable behaviour
to the K. <hi>de Jure,</hi> as a breach of the peace of
that K. for whom they are concerned? And
then how can they mean veraciouſly that
they will not diſturb the peace, in the ſenſe
of the preſent Poſſeſſors? How can they
keep the ſecrets of the K. <hi>de Jure,</hi> againſt the
K. <hi>de facto,</hi> without violating their Fealty,
and breaking their Oath, to the K. <hi>de facto,</hi>
which (as I have ſhewn) oblige them to
diſcover all Deſigns and Conſpiracies againſt
him? Or how can they conceal the ſecrets
of the K. <hi>de facto,</hi> againſt the K. <hi>de Jure,</hi>
without breaking their former Oaths to the
K. <hi>de Jure</hi>?</p>
            <p>This was plainly the nature of this Fealty
and this Allegiance in their firſt originals,
that they were Military duties, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
perfectly inconſiſtent with Neutrality,
and inconſiſtent alſo with themſelves when
promiſed to Princes in hoſtility with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And ſeveral expreſſions in the Act of
<hi>H. vii.</hi> ſo much miſunderſtood of late, ſeems
plainly to imply that this Military Fealty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
was that for which the favour of that
Act was intended. Which, if true, will, by
the way, cut off all others, who either hold
no Lands from the Crown, or hold them not
in Military ſervice, from even that Indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
which ſeems to be the uttermoſt favour
deſigned by that Act. Afterwards this Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
and Fealty was extended farther by
the Oath of Allegiance introduced by K.
<hi>James</hi> the I. This Oath might be tendred
to all Perſons living in the Kingdom above
Sixteen Years of Age, ſuppoſing therefore
that even ſuch Perſons living in the Realm,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51233:4"/>
under the King's Protection, were, on the
very account of their enjoying that protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
under the ſame obligations of gratitude
to the K. that the Knights were formerly,
though neither Soldiers by profeſsion, nor
holding any Lands on that condition from
the Crown. This is that which we call uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>natural Allegiance,</hi> due on account of
our being born in theſe Kingdoms, and of
thoſe benefits in Law to which we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled
by being born Subjects, of Purchaſes,
and Inheritances, and benefit of Wills and
Teſtaments, and ſome liberties of Trading
which ſtrangers cannot attain to otherwiſe
than by an Act of Parliament for their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalization.
And this is the preſent Notion
of Allegiance alluded to in the Act for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
theſe preſent Oaths. They are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
in the Room of theſe Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
and are therefore required from all
perſons qualified by Law to take the former
Oath of Allegiance, from all perſons above
ſixteen years of Age, though neither Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
nor holding any Military Tenures. This
therefore being the Fealty and Allegiance
concerned in our preſent Oaths, we are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to conſider whether the duties of them
be conſiſtent with a Neutrality between the
K. <hi>de Facto,</hi> and the K. <hi>de Jure</hi>?</p>
            <p>In order whereunto I conſider that the
change made in this enlarged Notion of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
is rather in the Motives and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on which the Duties are grounded,
than in the Duties themſelves. In both Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiances
the Liege-man is ſuppoſed to be a
Beneficiary of a Liege-lord, and the duties
thence reſulting are alſo ſuppoſed obliging in
gratitude for the favours received, not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on account of the Authority requiring
them. Only in the Benefits on which the
Obligation is grounded the difference is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.
In the former caſe were favours
uncommon to all the Subjects, particularly
that of a Beneficial Tenement for life. In
the latter, onely that protection which all
Subjects receive from the Government, and
the common beneficial capacities which all
free-born Subjects have a Right to on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their being free-born Natives of
the Government. The reaſon of the Fealty
or Allegiance in theſe two caſes is indeed
very different, yet the Notion is very much
the ſame. The Obligation, being in both
caſes due antecedently in point of gratitude,
cannot be underſtood to imply no more
than a bare Neutrality, or a duty of not
hindering the Benefactor from his Right.
But as there are ſuppoſed poſitive favours
from the Benefactor to the Beneficiary; ſo
the natural Return that might be expected,
in point of gratitude, can be no leſs than
poſitive and active aſſiſtances from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiary
for maintaining his Benefactor in
his juſt Rights. And the ſame terms of
Fealty and Allegiance being made uſe of
for expreſſing the nature of this new duty
of the Subject, without any intimation of
any new ſignification, the moſt obvious
and likely way of underſtanding them will
be to take them in the ſame ſenſe in
which they were uſed as terms of Art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as near as the change of the reaſon,
and circumſtances in deducing the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
ſignification will give leave. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the words Fealty and Allegiance
would not have been mentioned in the
late Oaths without inſtancing in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
meant by them, if it had not been
ſuppoſed notorious, what particulars uſed
formerly to be deſigned by them in their
Original ſignification, and that the ſame
were alſo intended in this ſecondary deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
extended one, as far at leaſt as the
Circumſtances of the Obliged Perſon will
give way. For if the Perſon be alſo Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
that will go far towards the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Military obligation.</p>
            <p>And if ſo, then all the Duties of the former
Fealty and Allegiance will return in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Allegiance alſo, and conſequently this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51233:4"/>
new Fealty and Allegiance will be as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with a Neutrality as the other was.
The Liege-man muſt here alſo, not only not
oppoſe, but maintain, the Life, Limbs, and
terrene Honour of his Liege Lord. He muſt
alſo keep his ſecrets, and diſcover all Plots
and Conſpiracies againſt him. And this new
extended Notion of Fealty and Allegiance
being introduced by the Laws, it cannot be
more Authentically interpreted than by the
Laws that introduced it. Whatever the
Laws puniſh as a Breach of Allegiance that
certainly the Law-maker intended that it
ſhould be included in the Oaths impoſed for
the ſecuring Allegiance. And whatever the
Laws puniſh as not maintaining the Life,
Limbs, and terrene Honour of the Liege
Lord, or as a Violation of his Secrets, or as
a concealing or abetting Conſpiracies againſt
him (which were all of them directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the duties of the original Allegiance)
thoſe things they certainly look on as a
violation of Allegiance, and conſequently
of the Oath impoſed by them for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
that Allegiance. Hence it will follow
that whatever the Laws, if they had their
courſe, would puniſh as Treaſon, all that
muſt be underſtood to be contrary to the
Promiſe and Oath of Allegiance. For all
forms of Indicting for Treaſon are, that the
Facts concerned in the Indictment are againſt
the Duty of the Subjects Allegiance expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or, at leaſt, for depriving the K. of his
Royal State and Dignity, which is directly
contrary to the maintaining his terrene Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
which was the principal deſign of the
forementioned Original Allegiance. But is
certain that the very owning of another as
K. the very abetting him, the holding cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with him where it may be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the entertaining him, and voluntarily
relieving him, eſpecially after a warning by
Proclamation, is always judged and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for High Treaſon whenever Laws are
allowed to take their courſe. Thus a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
correſponding with Enemies, on either
ſide, is <hi>contra pacem Domini Regis</hi> in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of the Law. The Peaceable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding
therefore with a K. <hi>de facto</hi> ſet
up in oppoſition to the K. <hi>de jure,</hi> will be a
breach of the Peace of the K. <hi>de jure</hi>; and on
the contrary, the living peaceably under the
Government of the K. <hi>de facto,</hi> will oblige
them, by the Interpretation of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Power under him, to renounce all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with the K. <hi>de jure,</hi> to betray his
Secrets, and his Perſon too, if ever it ſhould
come to be in their power to do ſo, which I
am confident our Brethren would abhor to
do from their very Souls. To be ſure it will
oblige them to conceal Conſpiracies againſt
him, and many ways to contribute to the
depriving, or at leaſt, to the detaining his
Right from him. This will certainly be the
Interpretation of living Peaceably under the
preſent Government, in the ſenſe of thoſe to
whom the Oaths are made, and therefore
ought to be their meaning alſo; if they will
mean ſincerely with the preſent Government
which requires theſe Oaths from them, and
to whom they pretend to give ſatiſfaction by
taking them. But then it will concern them
highly to enquire further how this will be
reconcileable with the Allegiance themſelves
believe due to the K. <hi>de jure.</hi> Certainly it
can never be reconciled, if they will but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the K. <hi>de jure</hi> the ſame favour of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
for determining his Rights, which
they muſt be forced to allow the K. <hi>de facto,</hi>
whether they will or no. And it would be
ſtrange if they ſhould allow him leſs.</p>
            <p>The Reaſoning now mentioned concerns
all Subjects equally, how far diſtant ſoever
their Profeſſion may be from being Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.
The Practice of the Law and of the
Courts does puniſh theſe things indifferently
in all Subjects, though not Souldiers, as
breaches of the duties required by the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Allegiance. So that is plain, that this
new extended Notion of Allegiance may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51233:5"/>
Miniſters, and Scholars, and others who
have no Sword at all, and who cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be obliged to maintain the Life and Limbs,
and terrene Honour of their Liege Lord by
the Sword, unleſs they be otherwiſe lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called to it. But it is certain, the old Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Allegiance did oblige the Feudatory
Vaſſal to maintain the Rights of his Liege
Lord by the Sword. And I cannot tell how
far the ſame Obligation may hold ſtill, when
the Liege Lord, who has the Right of the
Sword, requires and obliges them to uſe it in
his defence. In moſt of theſe Northern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
from whom the Feudal Laws are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,
the Arrierban may be called by the
Soveraign Power in diſtreſs, wherein all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are concern'd who are any ways capable
of Military Service. Anſwerable whereunto,
we have here our Ancient Laws of the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,
which whether they oblige all Subjects
perſonally, eſpecially ſince the ſettlement of
the Militia, perhaps in lieu of them, I leave
to them to determine who are better ſkilled
in our common Law. For our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it is ſufficient that, even to men who
are not concerned in the Sword, there are ſo
many interfering Duties between a K. <hi>de
jure</hi> and a K. <hi>de facto,</hi> as that it is impoſſible
they can ever be obliged to them both by
Oaths. Eſpecially on their Principles who
think themſelves obliged to their Allegiance
to the K. <hi>de jure,</hi> notwithſtanding the Poſſes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the K. <hi>de facto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might content my ſelf with this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
from the Principles of the Perſons
with whom I am at preſent concerned. And
I am ſure this muſt be the ſenſe of as many
as take the Oaths on Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi>'s
Doctrine, ſo much of late urged on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.
He plainly denies all diſobligation
from their old Allegiance, notwithſtanding
the Poſſeſſion of another, and by no means
allows any ſideing with the Poſſeſſor <hi>de
facto</hi> againſt the Rightful Prince, which yet
muſt needs be underſtood to be the principal
reaſon of impoſing and requiring theſe Oaths
in this particular juncture. I add farther,
that this very Principle ſeems to be granted
them by the Impoſers themſelves. What can
they elſe mean by the diſtinction they ſo
much inſiſt on between the K. <hi>de facto</hi> and
the K. <hi>de jure,</hi> but that the Poſſeſſor is ſo a K.
<hi>de facto,</hi> as that he is not alſo a K. <hi>de jure</hi>;
and that the K. <hi>de jure</hi> is the only K. in Right,
though he be not in Poſſeſſion? And when
they plead the Laws which own, as they ſay,
this diſtinction: that, ſure is more than ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
<hi>ad homines.</hi> And what can they mean
leſs by it than, that the Laws do alſo not
own ſuch a Poſſeſſor for a Rightful K? He
is a pretenſed K. indeed and not in Right.
This is the very language of the Statute of
<hi>Edw.</hi> IV<hi>th.</hi> concerning his rival Predeceſſors
of the <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> Line. This being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
granted by the Impoſers, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
K. is the Rightful K. how can they
avoid our Brethrens conſequence, that Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
muſt ſtill be due to him? And, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the other ſide, granted, that the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor
is, in the Law, a pretenſed K. in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed,
and not in Right; how can they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
defend the giving him the Rights of
him whom they own for their Rightful
K. and confirming that gift by a Promiſe
and an Oath, againſt ſo many antecedent
Solemne Promiſes and Oaths? What can
the name of a K. <hi>de jure</hi> ſignifie but that
he has ſtill a Right to the Kingſhip, or,
that the <hi>Jura Coronae</hi> are ſtill his in Right,
though not in Poſſeſſion? How can they
then avoid but that he muſt ſtill have a Right
to the Government, to all the profits and
dependences of it, and (above all) to the
Fealty and Allegiance of his Subjects? And
what reaſon then can they have to be angry
at our Brethren, for drawing juſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
Conſequences from Principles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
given by themſelves? And is it not a
ſtrange thing, that at the ſame time they
ſhould underſtand the words, due Allegiance,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51233:5"/>
in the Act of <hi>H. vii.</hi> of a truly due Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and not only of ſuch a one as will be
judged due by the Poſſeſſor? How can any
thing be truly due to him who has no Right
to it? Or how can he have a Right to that
Allegiance, which is only the Right of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Kings, who is himſelf only a pretenſed
K. in deed, and not in Right? What would
they ſay of Wives that ſhould alſo take
Huſbands <hi>de facto,</hi> and promiſe and ſwear to
give them all the Rights of Huſbands <hi>de
Jure</hi>? They may aſsure themſelves ſuch pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of Wives would not be more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with the Laws of Monogamy intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by our Saviour, than theſe repugnant
Rights of oppoſite pretenders are to the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
Law of Monarchy. Thus ſolidly our
Brethren reaſon from the Principles of our
new Legiſlators themſelves, and ſo little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
have they to deſert or ſuſpect thoſe
Principles.</p>
            <p>The good God awaken the Conſciences of
Perſons concerned in this Diſpute, and give
a timely ſtop to that Deluge of Perjury that
may prove in the event ſo fatal to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Churches and Countreys. In vain do
we think to ſave our Proteſtant Religion by
Practices ſo naturally deſtructive of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
How can we, for ſhame pretend Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
againſt Popery when ſecular Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
do ſo eaſily and ſo univerſally drive us
from our Principles? And what will the
Impoſers gain by this unhappy victory over
Conſciences? The obvious event will be,
when the firſt modeſties and Reluctancies of
Conſcience are overcome, that then all their
Teſts will be taken, and yet their Truſts
will be betrayed, and it will be impoſſible
for them to reckon on the faith of Men. If
I might give them my advice, it ſhould have
been this, and I aſſure them I now do it with
as hearty a good will to them as any of their
Flatterers. Conſidering their proceedings
were directly contrary to the Oaths of the
Nations, perhaps it would have been better
policy, rather to have taken away the Oaths
in being, than to have added new ones, (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made ſuch pretences for Liberty of
Conſcience) and to have obliged the ſubject
in Intereſt, by making their burden eaſier
than it had been under K. <hi>J. Intereſt,</hi> which
with ill men would certainly have prevailed
more than the Conſcience of any Oaths. And
it would have ſo far influenced good men,
who had ſuſſiciently diſcovered their averſion
to Popery, that they would not have ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogated
in their duty againſt them, which
is more than ever they are likely to gain by
their new Oaths, which have diſobliged them
in point of Intereſt who think themſelves
otherwiſe under no obligation to them in
point of Conſcience. This may yet be done
in ſome meaſure, and whether it be not for
the common Intereſt, I leave it to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and ſedate thoughts to conſider of.</p>
