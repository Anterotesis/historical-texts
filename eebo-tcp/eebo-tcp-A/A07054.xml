            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

at <hi>Marſeiles</hi> this preſent moneth of Aprill, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in ſuch manner as an honourable perſon hath ſet it down in a letter to a brother of his: as followeth.</p>
            <p>Brother I writ vnto you at large eyght daies ago, ſince which time we haue had won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful occurences in this towne of <hi>Marſeiles,</hi> whereof although you may haue heard before the receipt of theſe preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, yet I thought good to write vnto you the perticularities &amp; trueth of al, to the end you may with vs praiſe God for the fauour he hath ſhewed vs. Knowe you therefore that the firſt Conſull of this towne, being gone to the Court about two moneths ſince where he yet remaineth, the ſecond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull named <hi>Lewes de la Motte de Aries</hi> tooke the gouernement vppon him in the abſence of the Lord great Prior, which Conſull hearing of the late troubles of this realme, and in this countrey proſecuted by the Lorde of <hi>Vins,</hi> he caſt with himſelf how to prepare a way wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might vſurpe the ſoueraignitie of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiles</hi> and to that entent hee ſecretly practiſed the ſayde Lorde of <hi>Vins</hi> to ioyne with him, as aſſuring himſelfe that the pretence of warre and league againſt the contemners of Romiſh religion, whereto theſe people are wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addicted, would cauſe them to like of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb facs="tcp:5907:4"/>
his attemptes. And for the atcheiuing of his purpoſe he alſo practiſed two of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of this towne, as good as himſelfe, who eaſily condiſcended to his aduiſe, eſpecially the one called <hi>Captaine Boniface,</hi> who conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him that firſt hee ſhould make away his brother named <hi>Generall Boniface,</hi> a man acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted worth threeſcore thouſand Crownes: further, for the better compaſſing of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe he purpoſed to ſeaſe vppon the foretreſſe called <hi>Our ladie of the garde</hi> before he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouate any other matter, and therefore the <hi>8.</hi> of this preſent moneth hee went to the ſayde foretreſſe vnder coulour of ſéeing whether it were ſufficiently fortefied, the captaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, although he held nothing of the towne, yet ſéeing it was the Conſull, permitted him and thrée more to come in: he beeing entered tooke the ſayd Captaine by the coller offering the dagger to his throat, in caſe he once ſtirred againſt him, and ſo cauſed the gate to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and brought in ſouldiers to his behoofe, neyther would he ſuffer the ſayde Captaine to go downe into the towne leſt the people ſhould haue notiſe of his procéedinges. Thus finding himſelfe maiſter of the ſaide foretreſſe he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the next night to put his practiſe in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and to the ende not to faile of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

to the ſaid <hi>Boniface,</hi> he cauſed the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>general Boniface</hi> (who the ſame morning was riding to <hi>Aix</hi> to the Lord great Prior) to ſtay at the gate and ſo procured him to tarrie vntil the next morning vnder pretence of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by him a letter of very great importance for the kings ſeruice, to the ſaide Lorde great Prior, The poore generall not ſuſpecting anie harme, &amp; the rather becauſe he had lately Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened his child, did willingly alight and ſtaie his iourney vntill the next day, but before the morning trauayled an other way then hée thought for: for the ſame euening about eight of the clocke, the ſaid Conſul togither with <hi>4.</hi> of his confederates came and knocked at the ſaid generals gate, demaunding to ſpeak with his goſſip, who immediatly came downe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gate, where after vſual ſalutations he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him the ſaid ſuppoſed letter to the L. great Prior, ſaying to them that were with him <hi>do your office,</hi> which was the watch word, and ſo preſently they fell vppon the ſaid generall and gaue him foure or fiue blowes with their daggers, who being ſo wounded got vp into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> haule where preſently he fel downe dead, this done his ſaid brother not being far off entred the houſe méerely, and as enheritour began to rifle and ſeaſe vppon what he liſt, while the

tooke heart &amp; together with the chiefeſt among them determined to talke with the conſul, &amp; to enquire by whoſe authoritie &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement he wrought theſe broyles: others began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port throughout the towne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Conſull did al of his owne head, in purpoſe to bring in the Lord of <hi>Vins</hi> &amp; to make him maſter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> town, ſo that the people, not vſed to ſuch ſubiection, &amp; minding to maintain their liberty, began to quaile in that good opinion which before they had conceiued of the Conſull, which he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or at the leaſt greatly feared, &amp; therefore for a remedy anſwered ſuch as demaunded the reaſon of his doinges, that it was becauſe hee had notice of ſome intelligence which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants had practiſed in the towne, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting whereof, he had procéeded to the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them vp in <hi>S Ihons tower,</hi> which hee could not ſo well performe, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were ſlaine out of his hands: Furthermore, that he thought good there ſhuld be after dinner a méeting of the moſt honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towne houſe, there to determine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, alſo that the ſame ſhould be generall &amp; ſo it was at the laſt concluded.

about the towne, therby wéening to encorage the people to proſecute their cruelties, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them ſtil to continue in their affection to the Catholike faith, hauing before made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation that all men ſhould weare croſſes in their hats: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he perceiued that euery one reſolued to appeare at the ſaid aſſemblie, he &amp; his confederates hoped y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame to be the readie way to become the ſtrongeſt, and thereuppon concluded among themſelues to cut the throts of all that came, &amp; to that purpoſe to place <hi>60.</hi> Harquebuziers in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> town houſe, alſo to ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the bodie of the gard y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was beneath.

to them that he had reaſon in all that he had done, and ſo they brake vp and departed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out other reſolution, neuertheles being out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe, gathering their wits togither, they began to feare the comming of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord of <hi>Vins</hi> and therefore reſolued among themſelues at night to ioyne with the watch, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they had no ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſtronger: on the otherſide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lord of <hi>Vins</hi> could not that night bring in his power, &amp; fearing to bée ouer reached commanded the M. of the <hi>great Priors</hi> galley of <hi>Tholouze</hi> to prepare the ſaid galley, purpoſing if matters went amiſſe, togither with his aſſociats to enter y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid galley &amp; ſo to depart: he alſo ſent to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

began to quaile, as did alſo the Conſul afore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaid, becauſe whereſoeuer they became they ſtill found ſuch as would reſiſt them, which cauſed the ſaid Conſul to get into the watch of <hi>Canaillon</hi> turning &amp; toſſing all night like a moth about a candle, and ſo comming within the view of the <hi>Tower of S.

<pb facs="tcp:5907:8"/>
and the town aſſured to the king they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpatched a meſſenger to the Lorde <hi>great Prior</hi> then lying at <hi>Aix</hi> very ſorowfull for the loſſe of a town of ſuch importance, whom they deſired ſpéedely to come to them, and in the meane time they ſeazed vppon the fort of <hi>our Lady of the gard,</hi> which was ſoone yealded when they that kéept it perceiued the towne to be loſt, &amp; ſo <hi>Claud. Boniface</hi> was alſo brought to the towne houſe, the reſt ſaued themſelues. The Conſul being degraded from his hood &amp; office, was committed to the kings prison with the ſaid <hi>Boniface.</hi> The Lord <hi>great Prior</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued about a leuen of the clocke at night, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly they began to proſecute the proceſſe of the Conſul and his adherents, which was not perfected before ten of clock the next night and within one houre after, the ſaide Conſul and Captaine <hi>Boniface</hi> were both hanged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the gate of the late general <hi>Boniface,</hi> the people hauing continued in armes from the time they were apprehended vntill their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, This was the end of theſe two Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who were puniſhed according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, and reigned but <hi>48.</hi> houres: The ſaide Conſuls practiſe tended to become Lord of the towne, and not to vſe the Lord of <hi>Vins</hi> power except vpon neceſſitie, being alſo determined
<pb facs="tcp:5907:9"/>
to ſacke the ſame, and he had choſen for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his chiefe adherents thréeſcore houſes the reſt ſhould haue fallen to his ſouldiers: but God would not permit ſuch miſchiefe, who as we may ſay, wrought mightely, and ſauing vs preſerued alſo the Proteſtants, whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord <hi>great Prior</hi> did ſet at libertie the ſame night that he arriued.</p>
            <p>By this little may we euidently ſée that the words and writings of theſe men are no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite images of their euents, and therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we muſt rather haue recourſe to their actions, which do more liuely expreſſe them, and as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects do neceſſarily plead their cauſe. The dog and the Woolfe are very like, but their déeds do bewray the difference, the one being by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowne for a kéeper, the other for a murderer of the flock, and ſaith great <hi>Alexander,</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, ſuch as outwardly are clothed in white do vnderneath weare purple garmentes, ſo many times theſe preachers of religion, and reformation of the eſtate doe inwardly hatch Atheiſme and deſtruction of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: and herein we ſée, that it is not religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but ambition neither the welth, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertion of the eſtate that cauſeth them to take armes. This Conſuls zeale was tyranny o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Marſelles,</hi> and the religion of Captaine
<pb facs="tcp:5907:9"/>
               <hi>Boniface</hi> was ſucceſſour to his brother, the reſt of theſe zealous people togither tended to the ſpoile of their town and deſtruction of their countrie.</p>
            <p>But nowe to enter into conſideration of this hypocritical Conſuls pretence. <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>had intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the towne</hi> The like ſpeech vſeth the Cardinal of <hi>Vaude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount</hi> in the diſcourſe of the taking of <hi>Verdu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Neither is it to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled that they all agrée in one phraſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly poſſeſſed with one &amp; the ſame ſpirit who hath ben a lyer from the beginning: But leaſt they ſhould be daunted at ouer ſtrait ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of matters, I woulde aſke them what intelligence the proteſtants had in <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alon, Diion, Rheins, Maiſiers and Argenteau?</hi> It is all as true as the league of <hi>Magdeburge</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> lately concluded by the Lorde of <hi>Segur,</hi> as they ſay, with the <hi>County Palatine,</hi> who dyed <hi>8.</hi> years before <hi>Segar</hi> euer ſet foote in <hi>Germany,</hi> alſo with the protector of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who deceaſed <hi>5.</hi> yeares before: yea &amp; as true as that the proteſtants brake the croſſe of <hi>S Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> in the field néere to <hi>Paris,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within few

nights after, the Captain of that quarter ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed one that was making an end of the brea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king thereof, thereby to prouoke the people to ſedition. They muſt vſe ſome better colours in their affaires, for God by his iuſt iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hath vndoubtedly giuen them ouer to a ſpirite of aſtoniſhment, and therefore O poore nation beware, leaſt they vnder the like pretence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe thée in the ſame maner. Conſider in what predicamét this zealous reformer doth conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the king, the princes of his blood, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally al that follow not his faction, when he depriueth them of their titles of Catholike &amp; Chriſtian &amp; appropriateth the ſame to his like. This is the honour that he yeldeth to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie for his ſo often aduenturing his life in ſuch a quarrel. <hi>Thou ſhal not ſlander the law, the Prince, or the people</hi> and yet theſe great zelators do not onely in words, but alſo in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting continually ſlaunder the king, yea ſo far forth that the Cardinal of <hi>Vaudemont</hi> ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noreth to perſwade the king that he mindeth to vſe the help of the proteſtants &amp; Turks for the ſubuertion of Catholike religion: let vs therefore enter into the view of this Conſuls conſcience who for the eſtabliſhing of his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny &amp; renting this flower from the crowne of <hi>France,</hi> purpoſeth to vſe the weapons of the
<pb facs="tcp:5907:10"/>
Lord of <hi>Vins,</hi> though but as a ſcafolde which builders vſe, and which when the building is done they pul downe againe, and theſe treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do they learne of that euill ſpirite that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth al their actions. We may therfore here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſee what may be looked for from them. Euen you miniſters of the Clergie, Nobilitie &amp; third eſtate who haue embarked you ſelues w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them They vſe you, but if God ſhould ſo farre affect this realm as to permit them to attain to their purpoſes you ſhould be entreated after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilian</hi> maner. We ſée what <hi>Antragues</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy done, how he firſt impriſoned, then bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed thoſe captains that eſtabliſhed his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Know you not thoſe whom you follow to be ſuch as are of an vnſatiable ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom all the wealth in the worlde cannot content? They wil reſemble this Conſul, who for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his aſſociates reſerueth all the beſt houſes, appointing to his ſoldiers thoſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in nothing is to be had: but what ſtand I here vpon, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole houſe is ſhared out, what can be left for you? They vſe your help in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for their pray, but in deuiding the ſpoile they will imitate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lyon. The ſhares laid out they will ſeaſe vppon one, but if you reach to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the other, the lyons claws wil coole you: for men haue no fixed terme in their deſire of
<pb facs="tcp:5907:11"/>
atteining to riches. Theſe are ſubtill Foxes, ſuch as with the ſmoke of faire promiſes doe ſpoile you of al that you haue, that themſelues may ſeaſe thereupon. They be Mermaids, who to the end to procure your ſhipwracke do with their pleaſant ſongs ſeeke to ful you on ſléepe, but with <hi>Vliſſes</hi> ſtop your eares, and with the Troyans cloſe your eyes againſt this <hi>Helein</hi> whom they bring into this country to bury vs vp in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ruines therof. Let vs in this diſcourſe conſider the fruites of couetouſneſſe and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the one procéeding ſo farre <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oh horrible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians) as to murther his own bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how Catholike ſo euer, the other to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe his vowed faith to his prince and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew his hands in the blood of his fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and both togither to enrich themſelues with the ſpoile of their countrie. By this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample let vs iudge what elſe we may hope for of theſe reformers, ſauing that hauing begun with the proteſtants they will ende with our ſelues, or rather that as this Conſul beganne with the welthieſt catholicks, ſo wil they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céed with ſuch as among vs ſhalbe of beſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie: yea, who ſhalbe ſafe when the one bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpareth not the other: and ſith they begin with the Catholicks, yea with the king him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whoſe townes &amp; treaſure they daily ſeaze
<pb facs="tcp:5907:11"/>
vppon, whether ſhall we hope for better? The Proteſtants goods are not ſufficient to fill the broken bags or quench the inſatiable thirſt of theſe cormorants and this do not the chifeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them conceale, who do account of this realme as of a booty, to the end after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Silla</hi> to exhibite our goods to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt giuer. If at the beginning of this banquet where to theſe craftie victioners doe enuite vs, they ſet before vs ſuch wine, what ſhal we looke for in the midſt, or at the ende? Let the rich men at the beginning account the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues proteſtants, for their faire houſes, goods, and lands are ſo already, &amp; by this tyrants letters we ſée what the poore country men are to look for. Tyrants ſaith <hi>Diogines</hi> doe vſe their fauorites as bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, they hang vp the full and caſt of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptie. If then they ſpare not thoſe, what will they do with the reſt? Doth not <hi>Antragues</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to expell the richeſt Catholikes out of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> to the end to ſeaze vpon their goods? <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſthenes</hi> did very truly accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t tyrants worſe then tormenters, for theſe put onely offenders to death, the others ſpare not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> innocent. How happy therefore are thoſe whom other mens harmes can make to beware. Finally I pray you a little with me to ſtay vpon the diligent conſideration of the wonderfull deliuery of
<pb facs="tcp:5907:12"/>
this poore towne, togither w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> many good people in the ſame. The tyrant hath the fortreſſe: the proteſtantes are chained vp in dongeons, the reſt ſometime ſhut vp in their houſes, ſomtime beſieged in the towne houſe, and ſomtime na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked among his weapons: hee hath his power vpon both ſea and land. All this notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, God who ſheweth his ſtrength in our weakeneſſe, &amp; preſerueth the weake from the lyons iawes, and in the firy furnace, hath fréed all good men, and kept this place being of ſo great importance to his maieſty. The tyrants heart faileth him at his moſt néede: the Lorde depriueth him of his ſenſes, and he bandoneth his tiranny without any ſtroke ſtroken. None is more coward than a tyrant. God the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſher of kings doth preſerue them and their eſtates, and although ſomtimes he afflicteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the rebellions of their neareſt friends as he did <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſo that he bringeth them low as he did <hi>Manaſſes</hi> and <hi>Nabuchadonozer,</hi> yet doth he afterward deliuer and raiſe them vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. We ſée the ſmal continuance of this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, which laſted but <hi>48.</hi> houres: hardly did this tyrant giue his ſubiectes time to eate or drink, ſo ſhort was this bloody tragedie. Theſe were violent ſtormes, and ſoone ouerblowne. This conſpiracie was no ſooner ſprong vp but
<pb facs="tcp:5907:12"/>
it withered again: This is an example of gods iudgements, for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Who ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God,</hi> and who ſo reſiſteth Gods ordinance do draw his curſſe vppon them. Theſe be the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants which warre againſt God, and againſt whom he ſhooteth the darts of his wrath: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> ſhall neuer want power and courage to purſue ſuch <hi>Abſalons,</hi> neither doth <hi>France</hi> want trées to hang them vppon, as was this Conſull. <hi>France</hi> is yet ſufficiently ſtored of true and natural frenchmen, both willing and able to deliuer her from thoſe that haue ſworn her deſtruction. To conclude, thoſe that haue béene ſeduced will reclaime themſelues &amp; ſuch good and honorable perſonages, as hitherto haue kept their houſes, not for feare, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting his maieſties commaundement will take the fields to the end alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnder his banners to follow the example of the <hi>Marſilians.</hi>
