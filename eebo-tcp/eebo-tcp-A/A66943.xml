         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Chriſtian Champion, &amp;c.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>DEUTERONOMY XXIII. Chap. IX. Ver.</bibl>
               <q>When the Hoſt goeth forth againſt thine Enemies
then keep thee from every wickesd thing:</q>
               <q>Ver. 14. For the Lord thy God walketh in the
midſt of the Camp to deliver thee, and to give up
thine Enemies before thee; therefore ſhall thy Camp
be holy, that he ſee no unclean thing in thee, and turn
away from thee.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS is an Exhortation given from the Word
of God, and if we would be happy we muſt
be Holy; we truſt not only to an Arm of
Fleſh, but to the gracious dealing of a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
God, whoſe All-ſeeing Eye is over all our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and put caſe we ſin againſt him, How can we
then expect a Bleſſing from him, who is of purer Eyes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41200:3"/>
than to behold Iniquity with Approbation? therefore
let no Evil attend our Actions, we are here Beſieged
with Enemies who ſtudies the Overthrow of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, and would likewiſe Triumph over our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
but keep cloſe to your Duty in the Service of
the Living God, then will he prove your Protectour,
Pſalm 84. 11. <hi>For the Lord God is a Sun and a Shield,
the Lord will give Grace and Glory, no good thing will he
withhold from them that walk uprightly.</hi> It is our Duty,
at all times to live Cireumſpect in this preſent Life,
but eſpecially at this time when we are exerciſed under
this ſharp Tryall of Affliction, being cloſely beſieged
by a powerfull Enemy, and when we ſhall make our
Sally forth, What Man is certain he ſhall return again?
therefore let our Actions be ſeaſoned with Grace, and
Holineſs, that whether we live or dye we may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
in the ſight of God; therefore when we go
forth let us keep clear from every evil thing: This War
which we are engaged in, is not deſigned by us for
the deſtroying of Cities, or the Deſtruction of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
but for the maintaining of the Goſpel-Truth
againſt the common Enemy of Chriſtianity, thoſe
that count they merit Heaven by Maſſacring and
Murthering the People of God, and glory in the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of innocent Bloud; therefore as God ſhall bleſs us
in this Undertaking let us keep our ſelves free from
Evil; it is for the Glory of Heaven we venture our
Lives, and who falls in the Field his Reward will be
greater than his Loſs, it being in the juſt Defence of
True Religion and Piety; let not our Foes affright us,
nor any Fears attend us, for God will give the Victory
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41200:3"/>
to them that ſerve him, and make their Enemies fly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, as Chaff before the Wind. How many ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Mercies have we been partakers off in our ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Sallies againſt our Enemies? And ſhall we now
deſpair of God's Mercies (no, no,) he is able to Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us at the laſt moment, when we ſeem to ſtand tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
on the brink of utter Ruine; nothing is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with our great Creator; nothing can ſeperate us
from the Love of God but our Sins; therefore let us
make War againſt our corrupt Nature; let us deſtroy
thoſe Sins which makes us Enemies to God; for, What
is our Sighs, our Tears, and Prayers, if we ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to hug our Darling Sins? for, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith,
<hi>If I regard Iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me;</hi>
therefore let us be ſincere in what we profeſs, and not
to go from Praying to our Pollutions, or from hearing
the Word of God to the breach of his Commandments;
he in his Holy Word hath afforded us many gracious
Promiſes to ſupport our Spirits in the greateſt Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Tryalls; therefore be of good comfort, and
lay hold on the Promiſes of God by Faith. Joſhua 23.
5. <hi>And the Lord your God, he ſhall expell them from before
you, and drive them from out of your ſight, and ye ſhall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
their Land, as the Lord your God hath promiſed unto
you;</hi> therefore be exhorted like Chriſtian Champions
to goe forth with Courage, Deuteronomy 31. 6. <hi>Be
ſtrong and of a good Courage; fear not; nor be afraid of
them; for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth goe with thee
he will not fail thee nor forſake thee.</hi> Theſe moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cious
Promiſes may be ſufficient for us to rely upon
they are the Sayings of a God that is not only willing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41200:4"/>
but able; no Forces, nor Power is able to diſappoint
him in his purpoſe; it is not the great and mighty but
the humble and meek that he hath a regard to; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
put away every evil thing and it will go well with us,
Iſaiah 1. 19. <hi>If ye be willing and obedient you ſhall eat the
good of the Land,</hi> yet obſerve what is threatened to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
on the contrary, <hi>ver. 20. But if ye refuſe and rebell
ye ſhall be devoured with the Sword, for the Mouth of the
Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> Here you may ſee what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by God, and how gracious he will be upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of your Duty; therefore, as in the Text,
<hi>When the Hoſt goeth forth againſt thine Enemy then keep
thee from every wicked thing:</hi> Our War is holy, and
therefore we muſt be holy; our Sword muſt not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with Sins, which go forth in the fear of God,
and the juſt Defence of the pure Religion; therefore
while we purſue the Enemies of Righteouſneſs our
Actions will be Crown'd with Victory, as the Prophet
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> hath it in 41 Chap. and the latter part of the 12.
Ver. <hi>They that War againſt thee ſhall be as nothing, and
as a thing of nought:</hi> The Scriptures are full of theſe
comfortable Sayings, ſo that though our Enemy may
come againſt us with a ſtrong and powerfull armed
Hoſt, and threaten this City with ruine and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>yet if God be for us who can be againſt us.</hi> Romans
Chap. 8. and the latter part of the 31. Ver. for when
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt purſued after the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ael,</hi>
the Lord ſtretch'd forth his hand and ſhow'd his
Power in overthrowing him and his Chariots in the
Red-Sea, when at the ſame time his power preſerved
his choſen People: What ſhall we ſay then? Can we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41200:4"/>
not put our Truſt in him who is able to deliver his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
at the greateſt Time of Danger? Here we read
of wonderfull things which he hath performed for your
Fathers of Old, and he is the ſame God now as then;
let us be but faithfull Servants, and then we may aſſure
our ſelves he will be a Shield of Defence, and a preſent
Help in the Time of Trouble: When <hi>David</hi> was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
by <hi>Saul,</hi> and hunted after like a Partridge upon the
Mountains, yet God being with him his Life was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
and his cruel Adverſary could not wrong him,
his Heart was upright, his Conſcience was clear, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had comfort in his Afflictions. Thus it may
be with every Soul here, who labours to cleanſe his
Heart from Sin, for nothing can burthen our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
more, in a time of Diſtreſs, than a fearfull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of our Iniquities; therefore keep your
ſelves free from every evil thing; it ought to be the
care of every one preſent to ceaſe from Evil, and learn
to doe well; a good Chriſtian makes a good Souldier,
that will not fear to venture his Life in a good Cauſe,
and if God be pleaſed to require it, patiently ſubmit,
and then will he give you a Crown of Glory for your
Reward, 2. Tim. 2. 3. <hi>Now therefore endure hardneſs
as a good Souldier of Jeſus Cbriſt.</hi> put away every Evil
thing, God would have the Camp as pure as any Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
or Chriſtian-Society; the Reaſons are plain, He
that fights for the Glory of God, muſt be carefull that
at the ſame time he does not ſin againſt that Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
for whoſe Righteouſneſs he ſeems to contend, leſt
his Wrath wax hot againſt us, and we are delivered up
to the Fury of our Enemies, as a juſt Reward of our
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41200:5"/>
Impiety; <hi>put away every evil thing,</hi> Epheſians 5. at the
latter part of the 6 ver. <hi>For becauſe of theſe thing cometh
the Wrath of God upon the Children of Diſobedience.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
the Souldier ought to be prepared for another
World before he goes out to face an Enemy; for why,
when we enter the Battel, Who is he that is certain to
return again? you have every one a Soul to be ſaved,
and how diſmal a ſtate would it be to be cut off in the
midſt of your Iniquities, without having the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of ſaying, <hi>Lord have Mercy upon me?</hi> Thus do you
ſee how neceſſary it is to <hi>put away every evil thing,</hi> when
you ſee how ſoon the ſlender Thread of Life may be
broke, and you be hurried into everlaſting Miſery, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I hope you will all be exhorted, this day, to quit your
ſelves as Chriſtian Champions both in the ſight of God
and Man; this War of ours is a neceſſary War, and
not like thoſe reſtleſs Spirits who will not be at eaſe, but
daily endeavours to intrench upon the priviledges of
his neighbouring Countries, as <hi>Ahab</hi> who covered <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi>'s
Vineyard, and could not be at Peace in his mind
till he had enjoy'd it, becauſe it lay near him, as you
may find in 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 21. we deſire nothing more than
Peace, and the True Religion, Laws, and Liberties
which we at preſent are denied by that French and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
Enemy, the common Diſturber of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Europe,</hi> and
Perſecuter of the People of God, but good Lord, <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n
thy due time. <hi>Look on him that is proud and bring him
low, and tread down the wicked in their place.</hi> Job. 40. 12.
ſo ſhall theſe Kingdoms flouriſh once again, and the
Goſpel-Truth ſhine in it's full power; but let us all
walk worthy of that Heavenly Bleſſing, that Peace may
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41200:5"/>
be our Portion after the Victory over our Enemies
which we do not doubt but the Lord will give us, if
our Sins do not provoke him to anger; therefore let our
Camp be Holy, that he ſee no unclean thing that may
cauſe him to turn away from us again; be ſtrong and
couragious in the Lord, fear not the force of your Foes,
for their Bounds are limited, and they can go no farther
than God will give them leave, though they may reſolve
for Ruine and Deſtruction, yet they ſhall be diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in their Deſigns, for God will ſtill have a regard to
his People, whoſe Hearts are upright before him, and
will preſerve them under the ſhadow of his Wings from
the Violence and Cruelty of wicked and perverſe Men,
he will be in the midſt of our Camp, where his ſtrength
and power will appear, if we by Faith and Patience can
but wait a while to behold the Salvation of the Lord,
he will be with us; and defend us from Danger, as he
did his faithfull Servant <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyon's Den; his
Power is great, and his Love is nothing leſs; he will
not be wanting to thoſe who ſerve him with an upright
Heart; he will be their Friend to comfort them, and
will be a preſent Help in time of trouble; therefore be
of good courage, and lay hold on thoſe gracious Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of our good God; through his Bleſſing and Aſſiſtance
we hope in due time we ſhall be able to weather the ſtorm
of our preſent Miſeries, and live to enjoy a ſweet and
pleaſant Calm, and the bright Sun-ſhine of Proſperity
in this Land and Nation whereunto we do belong Let
none be found to murmur or repine at the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, for this his ſharp Rod of Correction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us; we have ſinned, therefore we may well ſay, it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41200:6"/>
is good for us that we have been afflicted; for it's a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
means to take us home: we read in <hi>Luke</hi> 15. that
the Prodigal never returned to his Father's Houſe until
he was afflicted with Want, and then coming to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he ſaid, <hi>How many hired Servants of my Father's hath
Bread enough, and to ſpare, and I periſh with hunger; I
will ariſe, and go to my Father, and ſay unto him, Father
I have ſinned against Heaven, and in thy ſight, and am no
more worthy to be called thy Son, make me as one of thy hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Servants.</hi> This his Sufferings brought him to a
true ſenſe of his Sins, ſo that he humbled himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Father, and was graciouſly received. Thus we
ſee how the Lord deals with his Servants when he finds
them ſtubborn and diſobedient, he will not deſtroy
them but chaſtiſe them and correct them, <hi>even as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do's his Son in whom he delighteth.</hi> Prov. 3. 12. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us draw near to him whoſe Love and Kindneſs
never fails, he will be in the midſt of our Camp, and
Fight for us; then fear not but we ſhall have the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
over all our Enemies; by one word of his Mouth he
is able to do more than many armed Hoſts, for they are
but Men, whoſe Lives are in his Hand, he can deal with
them as it pleaſeth him beſt: Shall they fight againſt
his Church and People, his Truth and Goſpel, and ſet
up an Idol-Worſhip, contrary to his Holy Word? I ſay,
ſhall they doe all this, and yet go unpuniſhed? No, the
Lord will be avenged of them, and ſuffer them to fall
before his choſen People; therefore let us not be in the
leaſt diſmay'd, it is good for us that we have the Lord
on our ſide, who has guarded, governed, and defended
this City for theſe many Months paſt, and hath given
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41200:6"/>
us many Inſtances of his Love and Kindneſſes, in bearing up our
drooping Spirits to a miracle, during the time of this cloſe Siege;
likewiſe affording us a happy Succeſs againſt our Enemies, he is
gracious, and his Mercies endure for ever; he will not ſuffer
his People to become a Prey to the Enemy, but will walk in
the midſt of the Camp for their Defence; thy right hand, O
Lord, is become glorious in thy Power, thy right hand, O Lord
hath daſhed in pieces the Enemy, and in the greatneſs of thine
Excellency thou hath overthrown them that aroſe up againſt
thee, thou ſenteſt forth thy Wrath which conſumed them as ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<hi>Exodus</hi> 5. 6. 7. Hear may we learn how the Lord did appear
in his power for his People in former Ages, and he will not be
wanting to us now, if our Sins doth not ſeparate us from his
Divine Love; he has loved us, and it is likewiſe our Duty to
Worſhip him; the Life of a good Chriſtian is ſeaſoned with
Heavenly Meditations, all the days of his Life he makes a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for the hour of his Death; let every Soul preſent exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
his heart, and labour to bring his Soul into ſuch a frame
and temper as may be acceptable in the ſight of the Lord, and
by ſo doing he will become our Friend, and will fight for us, ſo
that our Enemies ſhall ſoon be ſcattered; this is the only way
and method every good Chriſtian Souldier <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ght to take; for
let me tell you, that Souldier that fights for Religion ought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to be a good Chriſtian, and then live or dye he is certainly
happy. Holy <hi>David</hi> was a Warriour, and yet a Man after God's
own heart; in a righteous Cauſe the Sword may be drawn, when
it is to oppoſe the Enemies to Religion and Piety, ſuch that can
commit every barbarous Outrage upon poor innocent People,
without any remorſe of Conſcience, but on the contrary count
their horrid Villanies juſt and meritorious; but, <hi>He that ſitteth
in the Heavens ſhall laugh; the Lord ſhall have them in deriſion.</hi>
Pſalms 2. 4. yet let us keep free from every evil thing, for the
Lord is in the midſt of us, and ſeeth all our Actions, and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
into the Secrets of our hearts, there can be nothing hid from
his Eyes; therefore how pure and holy ought our Lives to be,
when we certainly know that we are always in the Preſence of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41200:7"/>
that God which will bring us to Judgment; <hi>It is appointed for all
Men once to die, and after Death to Judgment.</hi> Again, what
hardſhip we undergoe we muſt embrace it willingly, ſuffer chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and wait the Lord's time for our Deliverance, which we
hope will ſhortly be accompliſh'd; in <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>an while let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in our Duties, ſtanding upon our Chriſtian Guard, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
praying and making our Supplications to that Great God
who will not ſuffer us to fall; though we may be afflicted let us
chearfully undergoe our preſent Miſeries, and then we ſhall not
fail of a Reward; the greater and more grievous our Croſſes
are in this Life, the brighter and more weightier ſhall our Crown
of Glory be; he that ſuffers moſt in this World for his Saviour's
ſake, ſhall one day ſit the neareſt to his Throne in the Preſence
of Saints, Angels, and the Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect.
To which end God of his infinite Mercy bring us all. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>ALmighty and glorious Lord God, who never fails to ſuccour thoſe
that put their Truſt in thee, look down with an Eye of Pity and
Compaſſion upon thy poor Servants, and ſuffer us not to ſink under the
weighty Burthen of our Sorrows; lift up the Light of thy Countenance
upon us, and ſpeak Peace to us, and ſay, I will deliver you for my
Name ſake: Let our Enemies be ſcattered before us, who ſtands in
defiance of thee and thy Truth, ariſe, Lord, and help us by the power
of thy out-ſtretched Arm, and let them know that thou art a God that
can and will pull down the Pride of thoſe that would not ſuffer thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

that every one of us may be worthy of thoſe Mercies which we ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly

our humble and hearty Thanks for thoſe Favours already received, that
we have hitherto been preſerved, and not delivered up as a Prey to our
Enemies; and for other Mercies, as, Health, Strength, Succour and
Relief, it is of thy Mercy that we are not deſtroyed. Lord give us
thankfull Hearts that we may make a ſutable Return for all thy graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Dealing towards us, that one Bleſſing may make way for another.
Lord hear us, and anſwer us, and grant what we ask, and whatever

and our alone Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Amen.</hi>
