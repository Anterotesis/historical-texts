            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very gift of God, by how much the more excellent it is in it self, by so much the more (through the subtilty and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Satan) is it subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to abuse; and as the Wisdom of God doth order evill things
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:27645:3"/>
unto good, so the cunning of sin doth pervert the best things unto evil, and turn the very Grace of God into wantonnesse.</p>
            <p>Christs coming was to set Prisoners at <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Isai. 61.1. And of all other, this of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian liberty</hi> is one of the choicest Jewels, with the custody whereof hee hath entrusted his Church.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Liberty</hi> is twofold, either from Bondage Spiritual under Sin and Satan, or from Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage Carnal under the Ceremonies of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical</hi> Law, which in opposition to the <note n="a" place="margin">Jam. 1.25 2.8</note> roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and perfect Law of Liberty is called an <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 15.10</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable yoke, and <note n="c" place="margin">Ezek. 20.25 <hi>vid.</hi> Irenae. l. 4 cap. 29</note> Commandements which were not good.</p>
            <p>Two sorts of men there were, who professing the Religion of Christ, did yet (through the subtilty of Satan) stumble at this <hi>Liberty.</hi> Some were <hi>false Brethren,</hi> who dogmatically taught against it; and to these the Apostle <note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 2.4, 5</note> would not give place for an hour. Others were <hi>weak Brethren,</hi> who in their Consciences were not perswaded of this <hi>Liberty,</hi> and were offended at the use of it in those whose faith was better setled. With respect to these, the Apostle in this Chapter states the difference then depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Church; so that neither the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of the one might breed scorn of those who were <hi>doubtful,</hi> as <hi>weak</hi>; nor the <hi>scruples</hi> of the other breed censure of those who were <hi>free,</hi> as <hi>wicked</hi>; wherein premising a most wise and pious maxime, That weak Christians
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:27645:3"/>
ought to be plyed and cherished in the main matters of Religion, and not perplexed with impertinent disputations; and then giving directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to both sides touching their mutuall behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our towards each other, he proceedeth to state the question it self.</p>
            <p>For the ground whereof, he laieth an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent distinction touching Things <hi>Indifferent,</hi> which may be considered either <hi>per se,</hi> alone by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and so he states the question for the strong, <hi>vers.</hi> 14. or in <hi>Ordine ad aliud,</hi> with respect to some other thing: and so he giveth these three Rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In order to the <hi>Weak</hi>: so <hi>Liberty</hi> must give place to <hi>Charity</hi>; I must rather restrain my self, than scandalize and hazard the safety of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In order to the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Gospel.

            <p>Now the laying of this <hi>Foundation</hi> aright, and causing ignorant men in some measure to understand the mysteries of Religion and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is indeed the master-piece of the wisest Builder, and that, without the which all our other Sermons to the People will bee little better than lost labour, till these Principles be soundly fastened in their Consciences.</p>

Certainly, <hi>David</hi> had learned more reverence to the Lords House, <hi>I was glad when they said, Let us go into the House of the Lord, Psal.</hi> 122.1. And so had <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who with his kindred and neer friends <hi>waited</hi> for the coming of <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 10.24. And so had <hi>Solomon,</hi> who teacheth men to <hi>wait daily at the

            <p>And now when all this is done, <hi>Except the Lord build the House,</hi> they labour dut in vaine that build it. <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollo</hi> may water, but his Blessing it is which must perfect all.

eyes to see, and hearts to love, and mouths to utter, and lives to expresse the praises of his Word.
