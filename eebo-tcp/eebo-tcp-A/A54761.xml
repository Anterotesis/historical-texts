         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>And this is the Reason why ye shall not believe
Him, for that he made Brass Screws to an
Antipendium.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Beloved,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU are not to be angry or displeased to see me
read every Word of this my Discourse, it being
a fine, easie, lazy way, that we have not long since
brought into fashion, to save the labour of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
Mankind is by Nature generally addicted
to Idleness: So that the greatest part of the Worlds Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
that complain of the Shortness of Life, hardly know
what to do with the third part of their Time. This is that
which fills the Taverns, Ale-houses, and Coffee-houses; and this
is that Feneant and Scorbutick Humour that has infected Us,
that we had rather loiter away our time over Tea, or Turkish
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50261:2"/>
Liquor, than trouble our Studies, or exercise our Patiences,
to get our Sermons without-book. We had rather feed the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with Homilies, compos'd of a few <hi>raptim</hi> Expressions, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily
committed to Writing, than lose the sweet and charming
Society of our Admired GUIDE. O That Man, my Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
That Man, That Man! He is the Man; <hi>Ho Anthropos.</hi> I'le
tell you, my Beloved, I have a Project in my Head; and if it
don't take, 'tis your fault: If you will chuse me to be your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
I will undertake to read to you one of <hi>This Man's Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
every <hi>Sunday,</hi> and Expound upon it. Never fear it, my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
he has and will write enow to serve Us as long as we live:
to tell you the Truth, he squitters <hi>Observators.</hi> There you shall hear
the rarest Things!—Things, my Beloved!—Such
Things that put my Invention to a stand for Expression to bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
their indelible Character. For, Do you admire Flash and
Fury, as I well know you do? There you shall have it. Do you
admire the most confounded Impertinence that was ever made
publick to the World? There you shall have it. Would you
know how to Govern the State? There you may find out the
Knack. Would you understand how to Govern the Church?
There's your Director and <hi>Guide.</hi> Moreover, my Beloved, there
you shall find great Discoveries, monstrous Discoveries, Disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
almost past belief, of deep Secrets, profound Mysteries,
the hidden <hi>Arcana</hi> of <hi>Screws</hi> and <hi>Antipendiums. Screws</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipendiums!
Iesu Maria,</hi> you'll say! What are those? Why, my
Beloved, they are <hi>Screws</hi> and <hi>Antipendiums.</hi> The <hi>Egyptian Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphicks,</hi>
or the <hi>Cabala</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> never contain'd such ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse,
close obscure Significations as are wrapp'd up in those
Words. And thus, according to custom, I am coming, with
much ado, to the Point. And a notable Point it is; a Point not
to be spurn'd, as the Boys do; but a Point of Reason, a Point
of Reason not to be question'd, a Point of Reason not to be
doubted, a lasting Point, a fashionable Point; All the <hi>Point
Venize's</hi> and <hi>Point Lorrains</hi> i' th' World are nothing to this Point.
Well then, but what is this Point? Why the Point is this: <hi>And
this is the Reason why ye shall not believe him.</hi> What is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
Why this is the Reason; not a Womans Reason, <hi>Because
ye shall not believe him; but, Because he made Brass Screws to an
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50261:2"/>
Antipendium.</hi> Not because he exceeded <hi>Judas</hi> in Treachery,
<hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostate</hi> in Irreligion, <hi>Tiberius</hi> in Dissimulation, and
<hi>Belzebub</hi> himself for Lying; but, O most Celestial Reason, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of before! <hi>Because he made Brass Screws to the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, my Beloved, here are two things i' my Text; A Man
that is not to be believed, and the Reason why. <hi>Ye shall not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him;</hi> there's the Advice or Admonition: Then follows the
Reason in Order, <hi>For that he made Brass Screws to an Antipendium.</hi>
Thus ye find the Person in the Word <hi>Him:</hi> for do but decline
the Word, and ye have him presently; as for Example, <hi>Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nativo,</hi>
He; <hi>Genitivo,</hi> Of Him; <hi>Dativo,</hi> To Him; <hi>Accusativo,</hi>
HIM. There he is, proper in the Accusative Case: For this
<hi>Him</hi> is <hi>accus'd</hi> to be that <hi>He</hi> that made the <hi>Brass Screws.</hi> Shall
I open the Words more particularly? Come on then.—<hi>Ye,</hi>
that is, all ye that admire <hi>The Man, Ton Anthropon;</hi> Ye that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that all he writes is other than the meer <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Chiens,</hi> or <hi>Dogs-brabling;</hi> other than the Impertinent Flashes of
Fury and Revenge, or else the Grateful Acknowledgments of
Tavern-Adoration, while he blesses himself to be the aged <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muz</hi>
of two or three Red-twisted Clubs; <hi>All ye,</hi> I say, <hi>shall not,</hi>
no not for your Ears, that is, as you tender the loss of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
which is not worth a Straw; as you tender the Lashes of
his Pen, that are not worth a Rush; All Ye, I say, <hi>shall not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
that is, Ye shall give no more credit, than a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi>
would to a <hi>Heretick,</hi> tho he speak never so true, tho he has been
already believed by his Prince and Chief Counsellors; yet ye shall
give no credit to <hi>Him,</hi> that is, to that Person, whoever he be,
that swears he has seen the <hi>Observator</hi> at <hi>Mass</hi> in the <hi>Queens
Chappel:</hi> for this Nettles him to the Quick; a Nest of Gad-bees
is not more terrible at <hi>Midsummer</hi> to a gall'd Horses Back. It
makes him yerk, and kick, and fling, and low and bellow like
<hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Mistress in the shape of a Heifer, with <hi>Iuno</hi>'s amorous
itch in her Tail. Now these are the Effects of touching the
Copyhold of our Admired <hi>Guide:</hi> but wo worth him that touch'd
it; for the Law of the <hi>Meads</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> is gone forth, <hi>Ye shall
not believe Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50261:3"/>But notwithstanding this severe Edict, you'll say, Why may
not we believe him if we please? He discover'd the Murder of
Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> and was believed. He was also farther
believ'd, notwithstanding the Address of <hi>Thomson's</hi> Managers,
and the great Lists your <hi>ador'd Conductor</hi> gave them, to the
Shame and Ignominy of those that sought to blemish his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Why then shall not we believe him? Oh! my Beloved,
there is a Reason for that, such a Reason as all the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
could not have studied a better. Our <hi>Conductor</hi> is a Person
that has a Head not so big perhaps as an Elephant; but had he
had the Brains of an Elephant, a Camel, a Whale, and the <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian
Hippopotamos,</hi> all united tagether in one Scull, he could not
have found out a more notable piece of substantial Reason, than
he has done with that lesser <hi>Pericranium</hi> of his, <hi>Because He made
certain Brass Screws for an Antipendium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, my Beloved, to make you understand these Words
aright, I must go a preposterous way to work, in regard I must
set the Cart before the Horse, by a certain <hi>Greek</hi> Figure called
<hi>Hysteron Proteron;</hi> that is, I must tell ye what an <hi>Antipendium</hi> is,
what the <hi>Brass Screws</hi> are, then <hi>who made them,</hi> and upon <hi>what
account.</hi> I must confess, Our Conductor has made more noise in
the World with these <hi>Screws,</hi> than ever <hi>Vulcan</hi> and all his <hi>Cyclops</hi>
made at the framing of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Armour: Come into <hi>S</hi>—'s
Coffee-house, there was nothing but a confus'd noise of <hi>Brass</hi> and
<hi>Screws,</hi> and <hi>Screws,</hi> and <hi>Brass Screws.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Antra Aetnaea tonant, striduntque Cavernis</l>
                  <l>Stricturae Chalybum—</l>
               </q>
You would have sworn you had been in the Halting Deity's
Work-house, with his Journey-men <hi>Brontes</hi> and <hi>Steropes,</hi> and
<hi>Brawny Pyracmon.</hi> And what was all this for, but to prove that
there was a Reason why the certain <hi>He was not to be believed?</hi> So
that whatever was the proper Use of the <hi>Screws,</hi> Our so admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Guide intended them for another Use, which was, to have
trepann'd the soft Noddles of the Vulgar into a belief of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous
Contrivance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50261:3"/>But now leaving the <hi>Screws</hi> a while, let us return to the <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium,</hi>
alias <hi>Antependulum,</hi> corruptly <hi>Antipendium,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
its Being from two Latin Words, <hi>Ante,</hi> Before; and <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi>
To hang: And these two Words copulating together, have
produced a kind of Mongrel Monstrosity, called <hi>Antependulum,</hi>
or <hi>Antependium,</hi> vulgarly <hi>Antipendium,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Something
hanging before.</hi> Now there are so many things that hang before,
that I am afraid we shall be a great while upon the scent, before
we find out this proper <hi>Antipendium,</hi> for so we will henceforth
call it, for brevities sake. We find, in the Learned <hi>Petronius
Arbiter,</hi> that there are some Men that carry your <hi>Antipendiums</hi> in
their Breeches. These are, as the same Author says, your <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borum
solutorum viri,</hi> the Impotent and the aged. A sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
generally contemn'd by the Female Sex, and therefore most
commonly Cornuted; that is to say, because they have onely
<hi>Antipendiums</hi> in their Breeches, they are forced to carry <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standiums</hi>
in their Foreheads. Of these <hi>Antipendiums Iuvenal</hi>
gives ye an Account in these Words;
<q>Et quamvis tota palpetur nocte jacebit:</q>
And therefore (saith <hi>Petronius)</hi> the Persons who are so unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
are <hi>In Capricorno Erumnosi, quibus prae mala sua (sorte) Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            </p>
            <p>For this Reason I shall cease to speak any more of these sort of
<hi>Antipendiums.</hi> Onely, my Beloved, I shall give you this advice,
That you keep your <hi>Antipendiums</hi> out of harms way. There are
some Persons (a thing too common now a days) who are very
careless of their <hi>Antipendiums:</hi> And what becomes of 'em then?
Why, many times they lose their <hi>Antipendiums,</hi> for want of
<hi>Brass Screws,</hi> that is to say, firm, sound, lasting <hi>Screws,</hi> not such
rotten, foul, infected <hi>Screws</hi> as they made use of. Therefore,
say I, keep your <hi>Antipendiums</hi> out of harms way.</p>
            <p>There are another sort of <hi>Antipendiums,</hi> so called because they
<hi>hang before</hi> all the World. Of this kind was that same <hi>Crucified
Thief</hi> that was stoln by night from the <hi>Roman Soldier;</hi> but the
Cross was presently supplied again by the chast and vertuous
<hi>Ephesian Matron,</hi> with the Corps of her five-days-deplored Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.

Maid, the Companion of her Complaints, (hoping to come in

               </gap>band, to be an <hi>Antipendium</hi> among Rogues and Thieves,
rather than the Kind Soldier, that had prolongued her days,
should suffer. In the same manner you shall observe several <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipendiums</hi>
of this nature, upon the Roads of <hi>England:</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
three between <hi>Istington</hi> and <hi>Hatfield,</hi> who may be also called
<hi>Antipendiums</hi> in time, because they were hang'd before them that
were hang'd after 'em. Thus <hi>Staley</hi> was an <hi>Antipendium</hi> to <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Coleman</hi> an <hi>Antipendium</hi> to <hi>Grove</hi> and <hi>Pickering.</hi> Then you
might have beheld three more <hi>Antipendiums, Hill, Green,</hi> and
<hi>B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rry,</hi> who were <hi>Antipendiums</hi> in respect of <hi>Whitebread</hi> and his
Brethren. And lastly, <hi>Thompson</hi> and <hi>Farwell</hi> were another sort of
<hi>Antipendiums</hi> to <hi>Westminster-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, my Beloved, 'tis pity that Man was not made as <hi>Momus</hi>
would have had him made, that is, with Windows in his Breast:
For I am perswaded, could you see into our <hi>dear Conductor</hi>'s
Heart, you would there discover a most violent Antipathy against
the Person <hi>Him</hi> in my Text, and a whole Rosarie of earnest
Wishes, that he might live to see <hi>Him</hi> made an <hi>Antipendium</hi>
among the rest; nay, you might see another Result of his Mind,
that he would not spare for the Expences of half a dozen Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eets
Salarie, for a pair of excellent <hi>Brass Screws,</hi> to fasten <hi>Him</hi>
to the Gib<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t. And I give this Reason for what I say; For that
Person, who having an Enmity against another, cannot Coach it
by his Door, but he must <hi>lill</hi> out his <hi>Tongue</hi> at him, shews a vast
heat of Malice and passionate Fury in his Bowels, take it which
way you please, either like one of <hi>Lucan</hi>'s <hi>Menippus</hi>'s, or, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the natural Custom of Birds and Beasts in hot Weather.
'Tis an ill Sign that the same <hi>Maligning Person,</hi> sitting in the same
Church, at the same Service of God, over against the <hi>Maligned
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50261:4"/>
Him,</hi> should be so unable to temper his Charity in the sight of
God, that he could not refrain from a Cough of Derision, like
the <hi>Calling</hi> of <hi>Quails,</hi> or the <hi>Iugging</hi> of <hi>Partridges,</hi> to waken his
drowsie Friends to a particular notice of the Rehearsal of the
Ninth Commandment; as if the Timing of his Phlegmatick
<hi>Hem—Hems—</hi> so particularly concerned his Opposite <hi>Him,</hi>
that all the rest of the Church were presently bound to look up,
and stare, upon his Phthysical Alarms. Whereas, in truth, the
Breach of the Commandment lies upou our <hi>dear Conductor</hi>'s side,
to accuse a Person about <hi>Screws</hi> and <hi>Antipendiums,</hi> that signifie no
more, than if he had made the same noise, and bark'd with the
same inveteracy, against the Moon. Tell me, my Beloved, where
this Man's Charity lies, <hi>in Podice Canis,</hi> or <hi>in anxietate Asini?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I come now to another sort of <hi>Antipendium,</hi> I mean the
Play-house <hi>Curtain,</hi> that hangs before the Scenes. And this is
sometimes a <hi>Comical,</hi> sometimes a <hi>Tragical Antipendium.</hi> Now I
am apt to believe, that our <hi>dear Conductor</hi> meant his Conceit for
a <hi>Comical Antipendium,</hi> as having a desire to oblige the World
with a little Mirth; to which purpose he made this <hi>Comical Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi>
of <hi>Screws</hi> and <hi>Antipendiums, populo ut placerent quas ipse
fecit fabulas.</hi> What ill luck it was he wanted Intelligence to
compleat the Fable? 'Twas pity he had not heard of the <hi>Smith</hi>'s
Wife in <hi>Distaff-lane,</hi> that was perswaded to environ her self
with Back, Breast, and Head-piece, and follow her Husband to
the Ale-house, like a St. <hi>George</hi> a Foot, or another <hi>Penthesilea:</hi>
From whence he might have fram'd another strange Story, of a
Walking <hi>Antipendium,</hi> and have made three or four Prognostica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Observators</hi> out of it.</p>
            <p>Well, but you'll say, This is not the <hi>Antipendium</hi> which our
<hi>dear Conductor</hi> meant—However, do but hoise it up, and it
presently presents you with a Sight. First, Behold our <hi>dear
Conductor</hi> sitting in an Elbow-Chair, between <hi>Circe</hi> on the one
side, and <hi>Medea</hi> on the other, who have each of them the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of two great Fats, as big as Rhenish-Wine Fats (You would
think our <hi>Conductor</hi> Sutler-General of <hi>England,</hi> between his two
Camp-Mistresses of the Field) These Fats contain a most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and intoxicating Potion, between <hi>Circean, Medean,</hi> and <hi>Whore
of Babylonian,</hi> much of the same Brewing as <hi>Ovid</hi> describes it,
<q>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:50261:5"/>
                  <l>Nec Mora: misceri tosti jubet hordea grani</l>
                  <l>Mellaque, vimque meri, cum lacte coagula passo,</l>
                  <l>Quique sub hac lateant furtim dulcedine succos</l>
                  <l>Adjicit.—</l>
               </q>
About these <hi>Fats</hi> you shall see Multitudes of People pressing,
some for their Quarterns, some for their Half-quarterns, some
for their Gills, which they have no sooner drank off, but they
fall into several sorts of Frenzies and Ecstasies; some fall a Huz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaing,
some curse the <hi>Whigs,</hi> others damn the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> another
swears all Men are <hi>Liars</hi> but the <hi>Observator,</hi> another rails at <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramus</hi>
Juries. And for the <hi>Observator</hi> himself, he seems to
have taken a large <hi>Dose;</hi> for he does nothing but rave against
<hi>Aldersgate-street, Throckmorton-street;</hi> tells ye a hundred <hi>Bedlam</hi>
Stories of <hi>Screws</hi> and <hi>Antipendiums,</hi> and <hi>Vintners Boys;</hi> the meer
<hi>gerrae</hi> of a wounded Fancy. After this, you shall see two <hi>Iesuits</hi>
present him with an Instrument ready tun'd; upon which he falls
a playing as if he were mad. Thereupon you shall presently see
the <hi>Pope</hi> his nown self descending in a Chair of State, screw'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with <hi>Brass Screws,</hi> to hear the Musick of his Lessons. He
seems to be extremely pleas'd, nods his Head and smiles, and so
having given him thanks for assisting <hi>Thompson,</hi> abusing Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>
and <hi>Prance,</hi> up he soars again out of sight, and then down drops
a Showr of Guineys, and down drops the <hi>Antipendium,</hi> and so
the Shew ends.</p>
            <p>And thus we come to another sort of <hi>Antipendium,</hi> I mean, the
Gaudy <hi>Bushes</hi> that hang before your Entrances into the <hi>Oracle of
the Bott<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> a frequent Sign of the Habitation of a certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
called a <hi>Captain.</hi> True it is, that formerly <hi>Bacchus</hi> and
<hi>Mars,</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they were near of kin, yet they were two distinct
Persons. <hi>Mars</hi> was a God both by the Father and Mothers Side,
but <hi>Bacchus</hi> onely by the Fathers Side. <hi>Iuno</hi> was <hi>Mars</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s Mother was no other than <hi>Cadmus</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whose Name was <hi>Semele.</hi> Yet this <hi>Semele</hi> was akin to <hi>Iuno</hi>
too, as being Great-grand-daughter to <hi>Iuno</hi>'s Sisters Great-Aunts
Cousin-<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ermain. I refer ye for the rest to the <hi>Heralds</hi>
Office. But now I think on't, you may spare your selves that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50261:5"/>
trouble. For, as you may read in <hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Metamorphoses,</hi> or else in
the most worthy <hi>Ribadeneira</hi>'s Volume of <hi>Wonders,</hi> in process of
Time <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> were incorporated into one Person,
called a <hi>City-Captain.</hi> The Reason you shall find in <hi>Lucian</hi>'s
<hi>Council of the Gods.</hi> For they, in deep Consultation among
themselves, wisely considering the vain, hot-headed, frantick,
Hector-like, Humours of Mortals in their Wine, and what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
the Sons of <hi>Semele</hi> received, by breaking their Chairs,
slashing their Hangings, mangling their Pictures, twisting their
Silver Spoons, disfiguring their Tankards, throwing their Pots
down Stairs, and kicking the young <hi>Menades,</hi> or Drawers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
as I said before, to incorporate <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Mars, Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
and <hi>Captain,</hi> into one, to enable them the better to quiet the
Quarrels of such <hi>Hectorean Lapithe</hi>'s as should presume to invade
their Liberties and Properties in their own peculiar Dominions.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Antipendiums</hi> are of great consequence; for these are
those <hi>Antipendiums</hi> that direct the Poet to those <hi>Hippocrenes</hi> of
Sack and Claret that inspire him to write wanton Comedies,
Tragick Raptures, and Pindarick Love-Verses. That guide the
Melancholy where they may drown their Cares; the <hi>Huzzaers,</hi>
where to <hi>Huzzah;</hi> the <hi>Plotters,</hi> where to <hi>Consult;</hi> the Men of
Pleasure, where to Treat their debonnair Misses; Lords,
Knights, and Gentlemen, where to roar and swagger; and, in
a word, where Men may dispatch all sorts of Business, settle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
order the State, but more especially throw off the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom
Clog of their Estates, and gain the Appellation of <hi>Good
Common-wealths-men,</hi> for increasing the Publick Revenue.</p>
            <p>But now, my Beloved, I come to the Business, those <hi>Antipendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi>
of <hi>Antipendiums,</hi> the Female <hi>Antipendiums,</hi> the Ladies <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipendiums,</hi> the Mothers <hi>Antipendiums,</hi> the Daughters <hi>Antipendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums,</hi>
the Mistresses <hi>Antipendiums,</hi> the Maids <hi>Antipendiums; Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiums</hi>
without, <hi>Antipendiums</hi> within. As for example; there
is first the Gold-fring'd and Silk-fring'd <hi>Antipendium,</hi> that brush
the City Free-stone, and the Church-Pavement so clean, that
Younger Prentices and Sextons have little to do: The Gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Antipendium,</hi> so ponderously Fring'd and Lac'd, 'twould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
sprain a Mans Wrist to move it; so wondrous weighty,
that many times they crack the Purse-strings that hoise 'em and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50261:6"/>
loar 'em, tho as big as ordinary Cables, while the gay Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress
walks in her Circles of Gold and Silver, and bewitches all
the World. Now, Beloved, behind this <hi>Antipendium</hi> is another
<hi>Antipendium,</hi> and behind That, another: But then, Beloved, O
then! What then?—Oh! how I stretch, and yawn, and
gape to think on't! Then appears the <hi>Antipendium</hi> indeed, the
true, right, undeniable, Hyperbolical <hi>Antipendium,</hi> that hangs
before those <hi>Arva Muliebria,</hi> those <hi>Hortos Cupidinis,</hi> as the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Apuleius</hi> hath it; That <hi>Antipendium</hi> which if it be but Lac'd,
Emperours will stoop to raise it. This is that <hi>Antipendium</hi>
which the Unlearned, the Illiterate, the People of <hi>Long-lane</hi>
and <hi>Wapping,</hi> call a <hi>Smock.</hi> But now how highly, how infinitely
is the Nation, the Whole Nation (for all Men, all Sects, all
Opinions are now concern'd) how past all Retribution are they
oblig'd to our <hi>dear Conductor,</hi> for this fine, clean modest, neat,
harmless, inoffensive Word? The Ladies too are bound to give
him eternal praise and honour. For now, never no more, never
in this World, shall a <hi>Smock</hi> be call'd a <hi>Smock,</hi> but an <hi>Antipendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi>
Let the Word <hi>Smock</hi> be banish'd to the Skirts of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs,
but let the Word <hi>Antipendium</hi> be the Darling of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Tongue. How many serious Questions, which Manners, only
Manners forbid before, may a Gentleman now ask his Mistress
concerning her <hi>Antipendium?</hi> A Lady may order her Servant to
lay her out a clean <hi>Antipendium,</hi> tho there were twenty Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
i' th' Room. Certainly if the Ladies and Gentlemen do
not joyn together, and erect a Monument to our <hi>dear Conductor,</hi>
for making known to the World this sober, maidenly, bashful,
shamefac'd, mannerly Word, they will be very ungrateful, and
never deserve to have such an <hi>Observator</hi> again. 'Tis a Word so
modest, that the very <hi>Quakers</hi> may use it. This is that <hi>Antipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
to which the desires of Rich and Poor, Lords and Peasants,
Young and Old, all tend, as to the Center of their Happiness.
For love of this <hi>Antipendium</hi> some Men hang, others drown,
others poyson themselves. The Monks and Friars lick their
Lips at it. The Jesuit pulls off his four-square Cap to it, very
reverendly: Even his <hi>Holiness</hi> himself will not disdain to pay
his Devotions to this <hi>Antipendium.</hi> Nay, more than all this,
our <hi>dear Conductor</hi> admir'd one of these <hi>Antipendiums</hi> in his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50261:6"/>
drooping Years; nor would he Court like a Common Mortal, but
like another <hi>Iupiter,</hi> deceiv'd the Jealous <hi>Acrisius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now you'll ask me, What <hi>Screws</hi> are most proper to
fix this <hi>Antipendium?</hi> Why, I must tell ye, your Golden and
Silver <hi>Screws</hi> are very proper, and many times prevail exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly:
but as the Case may happen, many times your <hi>Brass
Screws,</hi> that is, your boisterous, ranting, tearing, confident
<hi>Screws,</hi> of which Epithets <hi>Brass</hi> is the general Emblem, and
therefore for that Reason call'd metonymically <hi>Brass Screws,</hi>
are much more desirable; insomuch that there are several <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi>'s
and <hi>Messalina</hi>'s of the Age, that had rather have two
such <hi>Brass Screws,</hi> than two and forty Golden or Silver ones.</p>
            <p>But here, my Beloved, let me give you a serious Caution.
Sometimes it happens, that by vertue of a certain Figure called
<hi>Synechdoche,</hi> the Part is taken for the Whole; that is, the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium</hi>
which covers, is taken for the <hi>Vacuum</hi> covered. So then,
my Beloved, if at any time you find the <hi>Antipendium</hi> more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
to your sight, than the <hi>Vacuum</hi> which it conceals, I
say, Beware your <hi>Brass Screws.</hi> Have a care of such an <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium</hi>
as <hi>Dejanira</hi>'s was, that burnt <hi>Hercules</hi> alive. For some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
you shall meet with an <hi>Antipendium</hi> scalding with such an
<hi>Etnean</hi> Heat, as would even melt the <hi>Rhodian Colossus's Brass
Screw,</hi> were they in being. I must confess, my Beloved, we
our selves, I mean those of our Long Robe, have a strange fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
for these <hi>Antipendiums,</hi> insomuch that you would swear, that
a great part of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> were turn'd Gentlemen-Ushers.
Which makes me admire that so many of our <hi>Sommer-Divines</hi>
should be so zealous for our <hi>dear Conductor,</hi> that would
so fain once more subject them to the cast-off Yoke of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
who will not allow them the convenience of these <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiums,</hi>
than which there is nothing in the World more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
to them. I could here run into a prodigious Discourse
of the Conveniencies and Inconveniencies of these <hi>Antipendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums;</hi>
but it behoves me to be guided by my Hour-glass, which
is the Measure of your Patience.</p>
            <p>Well then, by way of Application, the <hi>Moral</hi> of all this, is,
to shew ye how zealous our <hi>dear Conductor</hi> has been to raise and
improve a company of Tales and Romantick Stories of <hi>Screws</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:50261:7"/>
and <hi>Antipendiums,</hi> not at all for the Publick Good, but all in the
silly and shammaking Justification of his own Ill-Conduct, not
to call it worse; tho to the utter ruine of one of the Chiefest
and most Unblemished Evidences of that damned Conspiracy
against the Life of his Sacred Prince, and the Subversion of his
Government. A most transcendent piece of Loyalty, and most
highly deserving the Fat of Venison among Boys and Prentices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Alas! there's no body denies the Act of making the <hi>Brass Screws</hi>
to a Popish Chappel <hi>Antipendium,</hi> which hangs before the High
Altar upon High days; but that they were made without the
Approbation and Knowledge of the Employers, is that which
our <hi>dear Conductor</hi> would fallaciously impose upon the World, to
prove that <hi>Cain</hi>'s taking the Sacrament, was more acceptable to
God than <hi>Abel</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>Oh, my Beloved, you blaspheme our <hi>dear Conductor:</hi> Can he
speak an Untruth?—Why not?—For tho the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi>
was so kind to <hi>St. Dominic,</hi> as to give him a Visit from the <hi>Coelum
Empyreum,</hi> and to bring him the Confirmation of his Orders
written with an Angels Pen, we do not hear that ever <hi>St. Michael</hi>
brought our <hi>dear Conductor</hi> any Patent from Heaven to be <hi>Truth-speaker</hi>
General of <hi>England.</hi> And therefore 'tis a Presumption
and Arrogance in our <hi>dear Conductor</hi> to pretend to be the onely
Utterer of Truth, unless he could prove his Assertions by bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Proofs than the Flams of <hi>Screws</hi> and <hi>Antipendiums.</hi> 'Tis
much he had never another Story of <hi>Screws</hi> and <hi>Antipendiums</hi>
for Dr. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> who swore much more to the purpose than
<hi>Prance.</hi> Of which two Persons, when one of their Oaths is enough
to render our <hi>dear Conductor</hi> suspected, it is to me a wonder how
he can have the Effronterie to defend the Interest of the Church
of <hi>England;</hi> or the Church of <hi>England</hi> Men be so weak to own
him for their Champion, which is the greatest Scandal they now
lie under. But 'tis observable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Beloved, that when our <hi>dear
Conductor</hi> is pinch'd, he presently recoils under the Protection
of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and cries out with a loud Voice <hi>Treason, Treason, Lies,
Rebellion, Covenants, Associations, &amp;c.</hi> like a Dog that snarles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Masters Legs. But, my Beloved, our <hi>dear Conductor</hi>
is to understand, that there are Persons in the World that will
not come to <hi>Sam</hi>'s Coffee-house to learn what <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Loyalty</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:50261:7"/>
is, from such a <hi>State-Pragmaticus</hi> as his Worship. If he would
know what <hi>Loyalty</hi> is, we will tell him, for once, from a much
more Venerable Author than himself, writing to the present
<hi>Dolphin</hi> of <hi>France: After all that hath been said,</hi> saith he, <hi>we are
to conclude, That if we would observe the inviolable, the vertuous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of Subjects, it behoves us to be obliged to our Lawful Prince
by the same Ties that we are bound to God; that we reverence Kings
as His Lieutenants, and His Living Images, the Ministers of His Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and the Organs of His Will. La Faussette, des Vertus Humaines,
Tom. 1. pag.</hi> 487. Let him deeply consider these Words, and
make his best of 'em. 'Tis to be suppos'd, when he has conn'd
'em well, he will better distinguish between Loyalty to a Prince
and his Government, and Compliance with a Parish-Ceremony,
and recant his Heathenish Assertion of removing the <hi>Dissent.</hi>
In the mean while, let not this <hi>Shimei</hi> of an <hi>Observator</hi> brandish
his reproachful Pen against so many thousands of People, that
make so great a Figure in the Nation; Persons that from the
Peerage to the Tradesman share so large a Portion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
Wealth, and therefore not to be reflected upon, without
considerate Meditation, and the Conviction of Legal Proofs. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and Calumny will provoke the most patient and innocent
of Men:
<q>—Vexat Censura Columbas.</q>
Therefore <hi>Machiavil</hi> himself abhors Incendiaries and Calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
as the Pests of a Commonwealth. He allows of Legal
Accusation; <hi>but,</hi> saith he, <hi>Calumnies are detestable, as not requiring
Proof and Testimony; whereas Accusations, must be legally and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
made apparent.</hi> Let our <hi>dear Conductor</hi> accuse as much as he
can; but let hm not revile, and tell idle Stories, and call his
fraudulent and adulatory Assertions <hi>Loyalty,</hi> as if he thought he
could convince the Nation, by disputing with himself. Which
Admonition would he but observe, as the World would not be
so intollerably pester'd with his loose Half-sheets, so he might
have more leisure to think of retiring to the other World, which
he once promised to do, but has most wickedly broke his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
