            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Priſoners Anſwers being given, as is before mentioned,
it was taken for not guilty, and ſo after much ado a Jury was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
their names are as followeth: <hi>William Smith, William Bliſſe,
Nicholas Bliſſe, Robert Bartet, Robert Barber, William Smalbone,
Thomas Henchman,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And theſe were ſworn truly to try and Judge between the King
and the Priſoners at the Bar, and true deliverance make according
to their evidence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then three Witneſſes being called and ſworn, <hi>viz. James Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
a very prophane, ſwearing, drunken man; and <hi>Richard Poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
a prophane ſwearing fellow; and <hi>Henry Addams,</hi> being all
three ſoldiers: The Judge asked them if they ſaw the Priſoners
at the Bar at <hi>Robert Aſhby</hi>'s houſe in <hi>Bugbrook,</hi> at a Meeting?
unto which they anſwered, Yes. Then ſaid the Judge, What day
was it upon? and what time of the day? They anſwered, upon
<hi>Palm-Sunday,</hi> about one or two of the clock in the afternoon.
Then the Judge asked the number of the perſons, and what they
ſaw them do there? To which they anſwered, There was about
thirty perſons, and one of them was Preaching and Praying; for
he ſometimes ſtood, and ſometimes kneeled down. Then the
Judge asked them, whether they ſaw the Common-Prayer-Book
amongſt them? They anſwered, No. Then the Judge ſpake to
the Jury, and ſet them in a way, that they might be ſure to finde
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54969:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them guilty: they being a company of weak men (and ſome of
them maliciouſly bent againſt truth) not well underſtanding the
weighty matter they were imployed in; ſo the Jury went forth,
and in about half an hours time, returned again, and brought in
their Verdict, that three of the Priſoners were guilty of the third
offence; and the woman they brought in to be guilty of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
offence: Then ſaid <hi>John Randolph</hi> a Lawyer, have you not
brought them in all alike? Then there aroſe ſome confuſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them; but at length the matter was huſhed up, and ſhe
found guilty of the third offence, as they account it; but to
worſhip God in Spirit and Truth is no offence.</p>
               <p>But it was obſerved by many preſent, that they never ſaw nor
heard of ſo weak a Jury to be imployed in ſo weighty a matter.</p>
               <p>Then the Judge told the Priſoners, that the Jury had brought
them in guilty; and ſaid he, I am to paſs the Judgement of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
upon you; and asked them what they had to ſay for
themſelves, that the Judgement of Tranſportation might not
paſs upon them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Coory</hi> ſaid, We are an innocent People, and do deſire
to live in the fear of God. And further, ſaid he, I do believe if
we had been drunkards, ſwearers, lyars, covetous men, proud,
coſeners, cheaters, hypocrites, or diſſemblers, we ſhould not have
been brought here; for that by you is tolerated, or at the leaſt
winked at, and little notice taken thereof.</p>

               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>You muſt hearken unto me, and muſt not ſpeak, you
muſt give ear unto your Sentence; <hi>which was to this effect:</hi> That
you and every of you, ſhall be tranſported unto the Iſland of <hi>Jamaica,</hi>
there to remain for the ſpace of ſeven years; and if you return again
before the time be expired, it muſt be at your peril: but this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
you have, that if you will pay in one hundred pounds a piece,
before the Court be adjourn'd, you ſhall be freed from the Sentence of
Tranſportation.</p>
               <p>It may be obſerved, although Judge <hi>Rainsford</hi> hath before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
himſelf to be ſorry to proceed with friends in ſuch manner
as he did; yet the contrary plainly appears by his actions: for
when as one (called) <hi>George Robinſon,</hi> did ſpeak to the ſaid Judge,
(he being upon the Bench) in the behalf of the ſaid (now ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced)
Priſoners, and deſired moderately to reaſon in their and his
own behalf, (he being a Priſoner, and his time very near expired
which he had been committed for) but the aforeſaid Judge pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
gave order for his further confinement, and bound him to
his good behaviour (as they call it) whereby to prevent him of his
juſt Liberty. And thus as of old, <hi>Iſa. 59. ver. 14. Judgement is
turned away backward, and Juſtice ſtandeth afar off; for truth is
fallen in the ſtreet, and equity cannot enter.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Daniel Rooe</hi> being called to the Bar, and his Indictment read, it
being in the ſame manner and form as was the other Indictments.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>Daniel Rooe, are you guilty of this Indictment, or not
guilty?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſoner.</speaker>
               <p>I have not tranſgreſſed any Law of God, or juſt Law

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>That's no matter; are you guilty or not guilty, of the
Indictment?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſoner.</speaker>
               <p>As to that I have ſaid. So this Anſwer being taken
for not guilty, the Witneſſes were called and ſworn, being the
ſame perſons that witneſſed againſt the other, and the queſtions
put to them was much like the former, and the anſwers to the
ſame purpoſe: Then the Jury was ſworn, which was the ſame
Jury that went forth upon the other, only the fore-man <hi>William
Smith,</hi> was excepted againſt, and turned out by the Court. Then
the Judge ſpake to the Jury, and ſaid, <hi>You have heard, how that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54969:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the witneſſes have evidenced, That there was praying and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but they did not hear the book of Common Prayer read amongſt
them.</hi> And alſo, ſaid he, <hi>he himſelf cannot ſay they had the
form of Common Prayer uſed amongſt them.</hi> And here he laid
the main ſtreſs of the matter, and ſeemed hereby to make it
appear to the Jury, That becauſe Common Prayer was not
read, that they were Guilty; and the Jury being a going forth,
the Priſoner ſpake unto them, and ſaid, Oh Friends, and
Countrymen of the Jury, I deſire you, as in the preſence of
the Lord, that you take heed what ye do, for the thing is
weighty you have in hand.</p>
               <p>So the Jury went forth, and in a ſhort time returned again,
and cryed, A Verdict, a Verdict; the Court ſaid, Who ſhall
ſpeak for you? they anſwered, The Fore-man; then ſaid the
Judge, How do you find it, are you all agreed? they ſaid, Yes,
and we find it for the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then the Judge ſaid to the
Priſoner, Here you ſee the Jury hath found you Guilty.</p>

               <speaker>Judg.</speaker>
               <p>Well, well, you was at theſe Conventicles under colour

            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſ.</speaker>
               <p>I was not there under colour and pretence, but in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judg.</speaker>
               <p>But how do you know its the Spirit of the Lord? you may
be deluded, and led by an evil ſpirit, for we are not to be led by our

            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſ.</speaker>
               <p>The Spirit of the Lord leads into all truth, and this

            <sp>
               <speaker>Judg.</speaker>
               <p>Well, come, have you any thing more to ſay for your ſelf,
why the Sentence of Tranſportation ſhould not be paſſed upon you?
if you have, you may ſpeak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Priſoner ſaid no more: Then was the Judgment
of Tranſportation given, that he ſhould be tranſported to the
Iſland of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> there to remain for the ſpace of ſeven
years, unleſs the ſaid priſoner would pay unto the Court one
hundred pounds before the end of the Seſſions. So the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54969:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was taken from the Bar, and with the reſt returned to
priſon again.</p>
               <p>Now people it may be well for you to take notice,
how that the Tryal and Sentence aforeſaid, was paſt upon the
Lords people, even the next day following their pretended
Faſt, which they kept (as they ſay) for a bleſſing upon their
Indeavours in their intended War with the <hi>Dutch.</hi> But how
can a people expect a bleſſing from God, when they are
ſmiting with the fiſt of wickedneſs, and even fighting againſt
God and his Worſhip? Yea, even upon the very day of their
pretended Faſt, the Juſtices met together (as we are credibly
informed) to carry on the afore-mentioned work, of Trying
and Sentencing a people (for worſhipping God) even for
Tranſportation. And ſo inſtead of keeping a Faſt, which the
Lord hath choſen, which is to looſe the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and to cover the naked, and not to hide themſelves from
their own fleſh; I ſay, inſtead of theſe things, the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
fruits are brought forth (as it was ſaid upon the day
and day following their pretended Faſt) even an adding to
the bands of wickedneſs, and laying burdens upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
neither do they let the oppreſſed go free, but rather
add to their yoak, and inſtead of dealing bread to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and taking thoſe to houſe that are caſt forth, they even
caſt them out of houſe (and if the Lord doth not prevent
them) out of their native Land alſo.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaſure which hath been meated unto the
Lords people by this generation of men, after all the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
which hath been inflicted upon them by impriſonment

And theſe, with ſuch like as themſelves, the aforeſaid <hi>John Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,</hi>

halling, beating, bruiſing and abuſing friends, when peaceably met
together for the worſhip and ſervice of the Lord in truth, and not
under colour and pretence, ſo not liable to the penalties in the
late Act; for its known we are, and have been all along a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
people ever ſince the Lord raiſed us up, and the Nation hath
had great experience of the ſame; and ſo its altogether unequitable
and unjuſt, even the preſent proceedings of thoſe which do daily
riſe up againſt us, for the exerciſe of our conſciences towards God
in the way of his bleſſed worſhip, which he hath clearly made
known unto us, although we may not have a Common Prayer-Book
to read amongſt People, as Judge <hi>Rainsford</hi> would ſeem to
incenſe the Jury and others, that we were breakers of the late
Act, becauſe we uſed not the Common Prayer; which the Lord
hath let us ſee the weakneſſe and unprofitableneſſe of thoſe things,
and we cannot, like the dog, return to the old vomit again,
and like the ſow that is waſhed, to the wallowing in the mire;
though for the ſame we ſuffer; and are counted as tranſgreſſors in
the ſight of our Judges, but we are clear in the ſight of God; and
alſo the late Act clears us, where our enemies themſelves are not
Judges, or where Judgement is given without partiality; and ſo
our cauſe we commit to the Lord, even to plead in our behalf,
who through his goodneſſe hath engaged us to appear in the behalf
of his Name and Teſtimony, which he hath given us to bear even
in this day of our tryal and exerciſe of our faith and patience,
wherein God hath preſerved us hitherto, in all the dangers and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54969:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great ſufferings which is known to the Lord right well; and he hath
furniſhed us in this our day with all things anſwerable to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
neceſſities; ſo the glory of his works belong to him for ever.
And ſo its for conſcience ſake we are ſufferers this day, and for
the worſhip of God, and not for evil doing, as our enemies and
perſecutors would render it. And this we are willing to make
known, that ſo all might be informed concerning theſe things, and

            <p>ANd now all moderate People may judge, whether here is
any matter of Fact proved, or found to be done (by the
aforeſaid Innocent harmleſs People) againſt the King, or that
might make for the diſturbance of the peace of the Kingdom: And if
the Judges &amp; Jurors did but underſtand themſelves, they, as well as
other people, might ſee that all this that is done againſt us, is for
worſhipping of God in ſpirit and truth; in which way we worſhip
the true and living God, who is a Spirit, and will be worſhipped
in Spirit and Truth; and for ſo doing are we expoſed unto this
cruel Sentence, even to be baniſhed out of our native Land; but
and if it ſhould be ſo, we can truly ſay, Lord forgive them, and
lay not this evil to their charge; but if not, O Lord, thy will be
done: And indeed we might or could not expect, but that the
Innocent ſhould be brought in guilty, when as that wicked man
<hi>William Smith</hi> of <hi>Hardingſtone</hi> was the Fore-man of the (ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
fearful, and evvious) Jury, who ſaid, that the three men was
guilty of the third offence, and the woman of the ſecond; and
ſaid, that they were all agreed likewiſe: And when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
for it by the Judge, and by <hi>John Randolph</hi> a Lawyer, he
ſaid, they were all guilty of the third offence. And now ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more of his actions may be laid open, who was taken to be
a chief inſtrument for the bringing of the Innocent in (by a falſe
Verdict) guilty, when no evil could juſtly be charged upon them,
or matter of wrong done to any, the matter being only for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54969:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of God in Spirit and Truth, which the Scriptures of
truth, and the Liturgy doth allow of; and moreover, this old hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
ſpake againſt the Common-Prayer, and ſaid, as can be

Common-Prayer ſhould be uſed again in <hi>England;</hi> and this was
when he went to the Lectors at <hi>Northampton,</hi> one week after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,

for ſaying, that thoſe he then called Miniſters of Chriſt,
were Miniſters of Sathan, and that the Scriptures were not <hi>the

much more might be ſaid concerning this man, but this is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of our hearts, that he, with all the reſt of this wicked genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
may repent of their ungodly actions, and never commit the

wicked converſation before it be too late, and the door of mercy

encline your ears, unto what is written unto you, now whilſt you
have a day in which you may take counſel, if through wickedneſs
your hearts be not hardened; but however ye are warned, I mean
both Judges, Juſtices, Jury-men, and you that bear falſe witneſs
againſt your neighbours and Country-men, the Innocent, harmleſs
people called <hi>Quakers;</hi> although <hi>Richard Rainsford</hi> ſtileth them
impudent, becauſe they ſo boldly let their doors ſtand open when
they meet (in the way of Gods bleſſed Worſhip) ſaying, that we
were more bold (in this Country) then the reſt of our fraternity,
in other Countries; for, ſaid he, they will keep their doors ſhut,
and ſet their ſpies to ſee when any cometh to apprehend or take
them; which thing we do believe is utterly falſe, and is not the
manner of Gods people ſo to do: And this know ye our enemies,
and falſe accuſers, that the higher you climbe in oppreſſion by Laws,
lyes, and falſe reports, the greater will be your fall into ſorrow,
and perpetual miſery, for we can and do make our appeal unto
that of God in all your conſciences, who of you have we wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

or what miſchief have we hatched? or what inſurrections have

your hands from doing of violence unto us, for ſerving and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſaid in his Charge, ſpeaking of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

but nothing will ſerve their turn but thirty or forty, or more, and
ſo brings themſelves under the penalties of the Law, and then we
have two Convictions, and for the third baniſhment; and if they
return again without licenſe, before ſeven years be expired, then

            </p>
            <p>Oh, but this know, ye ſtupified ones, that ye are all this while
but mortal men; and if the hand of God be turned againſt you,
what will all theſe things do for you? Theſe cannot deliver you
from the ſtroak of his hand, neither give you peace in the day of
trouble, for our ſtrength is in the Lord, and he is God over all
bleſſed for ever, unto all eternity; and its not two Convictions,
Baniſhment to <hi>Jamaica</hi> for ſeven years, Goals, Whips, Stocks,
or Death, that can ſtop our growth, or proſperity in the Truth,
hinder or ſeparate us from God, or the comfortable enjoyment of
his good preſence, as we abide faithful unto the end; therefore
beware how you proceed, or elſe you will ſuddenly be broken, and
ſplit againſt the ſame Rock that thoſe that went before you were,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54969:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>

that we ſhould ſeal our teſtimony by laying down our lives (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

as if you ſhould never be removed: Oh build not your ſelves up

accordingly it was done, and there the Prieſt took an oath
againſt him, and affirmed (though falſely) that the ſaid <hi>William

the aforeſaid Town, and the Paper which he was accuſed for
diſperſing, was not at all tending to any ſuch purpoſe, neither
did the ſaid <hi>William</hi> give it to that man which the Prieſt ſwore
he did, for his neighbour came along with him to the Juſtice,
and there teſtified that the ſaid <hi>William Carr</hi> was not the man
which he had the Paper of, but it was another man of the

<hi>William Carr</hi> was ſent to the Goal upon the account aforeſaid,
<hi>viz.</hi> for diſperſing treaſonable Papers, and there he lay until
the next Seſſions holden for the County of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and
then was brought forth, and they knowing they had dealt
deceitfully by him to caſt him into priſon upon an account
which they could not prove againſt him, ſo they mentioned
no more the treaſonable Paper, but told him then, if he would
take the Oath of Allegiance, he might be ſet at liberty, but he
conſcienciouſly refuſing was ſent back to priſon again, where
he laid down his life not long after, and left his Wife with
ſix fatherleſs children, and notwithſtanding the aforeſaid Prieſt
hath perſecuted him unto death, yet he ſeeketh ſtill to ruine
his widow and fatherleſs children; for he hath cauſed <hi>Sarah
Carr</hi> widow, the wife of <hi>William Carr,</hi> to be arreſted by a Writ,
and brought from her ſix fatherleſs children to the County
Goal in <hi>Northampton,</hi> where her tender Husband laid down
his life, having no other thing againſt her but for milk, which
Tythe-milk as he calls it, came to the value of ten ſhillings,
or thereabouts, but he never demanded it of her, but cauſed

blood-thirſty Prieſt <hi>Richard Harris</hi> of <hi>Kiſtingbery,</hi> theſe two
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54969:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Prieſts often inſtigated <hi>John Willoughby</hi> (called Juſtice) to act as
he hath done againſt the innocent people of the Lord, and
when his ſoldiers hath come to a Meeting, by the aforeſaid
<hi>John Willoughbies</hi> order, they have eſpecially called for ſome
friends by their names, who dwelt at the Towns of <hi>Bugbrook</hi>
and <hi>Kiſtingbery,</hi> and took them away from amongſt many, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they muſt have ſuch, however; and two of <hi>Bugbrook,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

<hi>Thomas Dent</hi> lieth in priſon upon the ſame account ſtill,
and hath been priſoner above one year and half; ſo both theſe
Prieſts being guilty of blood, we cannot but mention them
amongſt the afore-going cruelties of the Magiſtrates of this
Age and Generation, which they have acted againſt the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
people of the Lord, whom they ſeek to oppreſs and lay
heavy burdens upon, yet our hope and truſt is in the Lord our
God, who we know is the living God, and will ariſe in his
fierce wrath, and will avenge himſelf upon his adverſaries, and
the adverſaries of his choſen people: but this is our deſires
unto the Lord, in the behalf of ours and his enemies, that
they might return from the evil of their doings, before the
Lord appears in his fierce wrath, who will bring deſtruction
upon them at unawares, except they repent.</p>
