            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SECT. I. The Introduction. Giving an account of the Authors Experience in this
Matter, with the Reasons moving him to treat
thereof.</head>
            <p>ALbeit, it were very desirable that Man could from
his very tender Age upwards receive so living an
Impression not only of the truest and surest Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the Doctrines of Christ, but also of the
Life and Power of Godliness to leaven the whole Mind
and Affections unto the pure and holy Nature of Jesus;
yet seeing that this Happiness befalls to few (most of Men
being by the prejudice of Education, either pre-possessed,
or defiled with wrong notions; or else those who come to
receive, even at first, a right Impression in their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
as to Opinion or Principle, do either by the
power of inward Corruption, working upon their Natural
Complexions, or by other Temptations from without, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
fall exceeding short of this pure Life) the best
way to <hi>Redeem the Time,</hi> and to repair that Loss, is from
the experience we have had of the Evil, and the Memory
we retain of, how far we have been wrong to confirm
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64465:4"/>
and strengthen our selves in the good now revealed and
imbraced, which by the powerful working of God's Infinite
Goodness, turning all to the advantage of those that love
and follow Him, makes the Ministry of such the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
as in the example of <hi>Paul</hi> and others was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.</p>
            <p>It being then so, that the condition of my life hitherto
(Albeit, I as yet am but a young Man) gives me experience
more then perhaps to many others, to treat of this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
Therefore, finding a true freedom and liberty in my
spirit, I have willingly undertaken, for the sake of some,
to write something briefly, and yet I hope clearly thereof,
that my experience herein, if the Lord will, by His Blessing
may be made useful to others.</p>
            <p>My first Education from my Infancy up, fell amongst the
strictest sort of <hi>Calvinists,</hi> those of our Country being
generally acknowledged to be the severest of that Sect in
the heat of Zeal, surpassing not only <hi>Geneva,</hi> from whence
they derive their Pedigree; but all other the Reformed
Churches abroad (so called) so that some of the French
Protestants being upbraided with the fruits of this Zeal, as
it appeared in <hi>Jo. Knox, Buchanan,</hi> and others do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
what is peculiar to their Principles of this kind, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the super-abundance thereof to proceed <hi>a fervido Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum
Ingenio, i. e.</hi> from the violent Complexion of our
Country men. I had scarce got out of my Child-hood
when I was by the permission of Divine Providence cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Company of <hi>Papists,</hi> and my tender years, and
immature Capacity not being able to withstand and resist
the Insinuations that were used to Proselite me to that
way; I became quickly defiled with the Pollutions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and continued therein for a time, until it pleased God,
through his rich Love and Mercy, to deliver me out of
those Snares, and to give me a clear understanding of the
evil of that way. In both these Sects, the Reader may
easily conceive that I had abundant occasion to receive
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64465:4"/>
Impressions contrary to this principle of Love herein treated
of, seeing the straitness of several of their Doctrines, as
well as their practice of Persecution, do abundantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
how opposite they are to <hi>Universal Love</hi> (as shall
hereafter more at large be shown) and Albeit, the time it
pleased God to deliver me out of these Snares, I was so young,
that it may be presumed my Observations could be but
weak, and consequently my Experience inconsiderable; yet
for as much as from my very Child-hood I was very ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of Knowledge, and by a certain felicity of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
I think I may say without Vanity, successful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
many of my Equals in Age, though my Observations
at that time were but weak, yet since I have with more
leisure and circumspection gathered thence so much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as I am confident will serve for a sufficient foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
to any Superstructure I shall build upon it in this
Treatise.</p>
            <p>The time that intervened betwixt my forsaking of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and joyning with those, with whom I
stand now ingaged, <hi>I</hi> kept my self free from joyning with
any sort of People, though I took liberty to hear several;
and my Converse was most with those that inveigh much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
judging and such kind of severity, seeming to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
greatly for want of this Christian Charity among all
Sects, which Latitude may perhaps be esteemed the other
extream opposite to the preciseness of these other Sects,
whereby I also received an opportunity to know what usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
is pretented on that side likewise; and thence can
say somewhat experimentally on that part also.</p>
            <p>As for those I am now joyned to, and whom I justly esteem
to be the true followers and Servants of Jesus Christ, the
World speaks diversly of them, as to this matter, some
highly accusing them of the want of Charity, and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with them as such who peremptorily condemn all but
themselves: Others have a contrary conceit of them, each
according as they are prejudicated and informed. What
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64465:5"/>
may be truly said in the case, shall after appear: I my
self have been diversly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> censured in this matter, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in Controversie, which as they can be scarcely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
without something of sharpness, so are seldom man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
by any so successfully, as not to bear the Censure
of some or other, in this respect. Having then upon the
whole matter observed that this want of Charity is that,
for the want of which, each Sect accuses the other, and yet
are most averse to see this defect in themselves, and that
some do accuse all Sects as guilty of this Crime. I have
judged it meet to commit my sence hereof to writing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the purpose signified in the Title afore-mentioned.</p>

            <head>SECT. II. The Nature of Christian Love and Charity demonstrated, the
Consistancy of true Zeal therewith, it's distinction from
false Zeal.</head>
            <p>THe Nature of Christian Love and Charity is fully and
abundantly described in the Holy Scriptures, where
it is preferred before all other Virtues and properties what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
as that which comprehendeth in it all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and is the root and spring of them, for there can
be no true Virtue but that which proceedeth from Love;
hence God himself is called <hi>Love, I Jo.</hi> 4. 7. as being that,
under which all his innumerable and inutterable perfections
are included: By this <hi>Love</hi> we are Redeemed from the
Corruption of our Nature, and have received the benefit
of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> Joh. 16. This is the <hi>Banner</hi> wherewith God
covereth his Children, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 4. This is that which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
our Lord Jesus Christ to lay down his Life for us,
Joh.</hi> 15. 13. The exercise of this is given by Christ as the
principal Token of his Disciples, <hi>Joh. 13. 35. It is num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64465:5"/>
as the first fruit of the Spirit, Gal. 5. 22. It is called
the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> as that, <hi>wherein all consisteth,</hi>
Rom. 13. 10. <hi>For to Love God above all things, and our
Neighbour as our selves,</hi> is the sum not only of the <hi>Law,</hi>
but of the <hi>Gospel</hi> also, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<hi>Paul</hi> giveth to this <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Charity</hi> the Precedency
before either Faith or Hope; in which Chapter he doth
briefly, but very emphatically describe it, for having first
shewn that the <hi>speaking with Tongues of Men,</hi> and Angels,
that the gifts of Prophesying, Understanding, and Knowledge,
that the Faith that even could remove Mountains, and the
giving of all to the Poor, <hi>yea, and</hi> the Body to be burnt, is
nothing without it: <hi>He proceeds to the description of it
thus,</hi> Charity suffers long, is kind; Charity envieth not,
Vaunteth not it self, is not puffed up, does not behave it self
unseemly, seeking not her own, is not easily provoked, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no evil, rejoyceth not in Iniquity, but rejoyceth in the
Truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all
things, endureth all things, never faileth, Albeit, other
gifts have, 1 Cor. 13. from the first Verse. As by this the
excellency of Love is shown, so the necessity of pressing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it, and living in it, will be readily acknowledged by
all; but seeing the sum of this Love, as well as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
thereof, consists in <hi>loving God above all;</hi> so what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
diverteth in any thing there-from, is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
Love, though the same word be used to express
it, and that in the Scripture it self; such as the Love of
Self, the Love of the World, the Love of any Creature.
Hence for the attaining of the true and excellent Love,
the Love of all these other things is not only to be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
and the Love of God preferred to them, but they are
to be hated as Christ himself Phraseth it, <hi>He that hateth
his life,</hi> Jo. 12. 25. Yea, he useth it so, as to speaking of
<hi>hating Father and Mother,</hi> Luk. 14. 26. though when the
Love to such, is truly subordinate to the other, it is both
commended and commanded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64465:6"/>
The Testimony which is required of our really being in
the Love of God, Christ himself signifieth to us: <hi>If you
Love me, keep my Commandements:</hi> And as the Beloved
Disciple <hi>John</hi> said in the case of Knowledge, shewing us
the falshood of such as pretend to know God, and yet do
not so; saying, <hi>He that says he knows God, and keeps not
his Commandements, is a Lyar, and the Truth is not in him,</hi>
1 Jo. 2. 4. So may be also said, He that saith he loves God,
and keeps not his Commandment, is a Lyar, and
the Truth is not in him, according as the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
saith, <hi>I Jo. 5. 3. For this is the Love of God, that we
keep his Commandements.</hi> Hence it is apparent, that Love
without Purity is but a false pretence; and that whatsoever
hinders from the practice of this Love of God, or with
draws from the obedience of the least of his Commands, is
to be denyed, and no ways to be entertained, as being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the love of the Devil, the love of the World, or the
love of Self, and not the love of the Father; and as from
the true love of God, having taken place both upon the
Understanding and Will, there ariseth a great fervency
and desire of Mind, that it may be wholly united with the
Lord, and made conformable unto his Will in all things:
So from hence ariseth also a certain Aversion from, Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of, and even Hatred, to whatsoever is contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
or has a tendency to lead from it, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>Zeal;</hi> which <hi>Zeal,</hi> having a right bottom and
foundation, and proceeding purely from the Love of God,
is a great Virtue, greatly to be commended and pressed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the defect thereof is justly reproveable in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
That <hi>Zeal</hi> then thus considered, is a thing excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
pure, and holy of it self, appears in that it is ascribed
to God himself, 2 <hi>King. 19. 13. Isa.</hi> 9. 7. Where the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the Blessed Evangelical promises is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the <hi>Zeal</hi> of the Lord, <hi>Isa.</hi> 19. 17. He is said <hi>to
be Cloathed with Zeal as with a Cloak,</hi> and 63. 15. His
Zeal is numbred with <hi>his Bowels and Mercies;</hi> next <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64465:6"/>
recommends himself to God, for that <hi>the Zeal of his
House had eaten him up, Psal.</hi> 69. 9. and 119. 139. And
<hi>Paul</hi> commends the <hi>Corinthians for their Zeal,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 11.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 12. and for this end has the Grace of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
unto all, that there might be a People gathered,
<hi>Zealous of good Works,</hi> Tit, 2. 14. And as this is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and recommended on the one hand, so is the contrary
thereof; to wit, Indifferency and Lukewarmness reproved
and rebuked as a thing displeasing to the Lord, of many
instances whereof that might be given, that unto the Church
of <hi>Laodicea</hi> may serve at present, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 15. 16. Because
for a Remedy against this Evil, she is Exhorted, <hi>v.</hi> 19. to
be <hi>Zealous and Repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as there is a true <hi>Zeal,</hi> so is there a false one, and
it is not more needful to have the one, then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the other. Now as the true <hi>Zeal</hi> proceedeth only
from the pure Love of God, and single Regard to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Glory, so the false <hi>Zeal</hi> proceedeth from the
Love of something else, and the regard to other things:
And of this false <hi>Zeal</hi> there are several kinds as well as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
all of which, though they ought to be shunned,
yet some are far more hurtful and pernitious than others;
the worst and highest of these is when as Men, through
the height of Pride, Lust, Ambition, or Envy, shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
furious and <hi>Zealous</hi> to satisfie and fulfill their
desires and affections, this is the highest <hi>Zeal</hi> for self;
From this <hi>Zeal</hi> did <hi>Cain</hi> flay <hi>Abel, Ishmael</hi> mocked <hi>Isaac,</hi>
and <hi>Esau</hi> hated <hi>Jacob, Pharoah</hi> Persecuted the Children of
<hi>Israel, Saul, David,</hi> and <hi>Jezabel,</hi> the true Prophets of the
Lord.</p>
            <p>A second kind is, when as Men that are not true and
faithful, even to those principles of Religion, they profess
themselves to acknowledge as true, as being Conscious to
themselves, and also publickly known to be such as are Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and Profligate, yet do violently persecute and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
others that differs from them; though they be not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64465:7"/>
only equal to them, but even by their own acknowledgment
exceed them in Temperance and Virtue, having nothing
to charge them with, but that they agree not with them in
judgment and practice in matters of Religion: This appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
is a false <hi>Zeal,</hi> and not of God, for if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the true Love of God, it would first
operate in themselves to the removing of all those
things which they acknowledge to be contrary to this
Love of God, before it exerted it self towards others,
seeing as the Proverb is, <hi>Charity begins at home.</hi> And
like unto this was the <hi>Zeal</hi> of the Scribes and Pharisees,
who Persecuted Christ for a breaker of the Law which
themselves did not fulfil: As is also the <hi>Zeal</hi> both of the
Papists and Protestants in their Persecutions at this day.</p>
            <p>A third sort is of such, who do indeed walk strictly and
closely to their own Principles, making Conscience of their
way; but yet being blinded in their understanding, do Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
Truth, supposing it to be Error: Of this number
was <hi>Paul</hi> before his Conversion, <hi>Being as to the Law blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi>
and Persecuting the Saints out of <hi>Zeal,</hi> Act. 22. 3.
Gal. 1. 14. And therefore, in this Class he numbers his
Country-men, saying, <hi>They have a</hi> Zeal <hi>for God, but not
according to knowledge,</hi> Rom. 10. 2. And perhaps among
these, such may be numbred, of whom Christ speaketh, saying
to his Disciples, and <hi>when they kill you, they shall think to
do God good Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A fourth or last sort is, when as Men being truly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
in their Understanding, but their Will, Heart, and
Affections not being throughly leavened with the Love of
God, do condemn things justly reproveable, but not out of
the pure drawings of Divine Love, but even from a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of self in the forwardness of their own will, as not
suffering any to be contrary unto them.</p>
            <p>This is the most innocent kind of wrong <hi>Zeal;</hi> yet not
so that it ought to be watched against, and of those few
that are guilty of it, it were fit they waited to be Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64465:7"/>
from it; but the pure undefiled <hi>Zeal</hi> that is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God, is that which proceeds not only from a pure
and clear understanding, but also from a renewed and
sanctified Will which moves not of, nor from Self, but
from and for the Lord.</p>

         <div n="3" type="section">
            <head>SECT. III. The Controversie stated, with respect to the different sort of
Christians; how it is to be fetched from the nature of their
Principles, and not from the practice of particular persons.</head>
            <p>THe sun of what is said, is, that true <hi>Christian Love</hi> and
<hi>Charity,</hi> is the most excellent of Virtues, most need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to be sought after and attained, that it is never
joyned, but with purity, which it naturally leads to; and
there-from doth consequentially arise an <hi>Indignation</hi> and
<hi>Zeal</hi> against Unrighteousness, which <hi>true Zeal</hi> is justly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
and really distinguishable from all false and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<hi>Zeal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the more clear stating of the Controversie in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in this matter, these following assertions relating
thereto may be proposed and affirmed.</p>
            <p>I. That whatsoever <hi>Love</hi> is consistent with the <hi>pure Love
of God,</hi> may be safely exercised towards all sorts, as well
of Men as Christians.</p>
            <p>II. That whatsoever <hi>Love or Charity</hi> really conduceth to
the salvation of their souls, and so far as they are capable
thereof, may and ought to be shewed towards them.</p>
            <p>III. That therefore the good in all ought to be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
encouraged,</hi> and <hi>loved,</hi> and no true Good either
denyed, rejected, or despised, because of any Errors pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to respective Sects.</p>
            <p>IV. That the Evil, either in Opinion or practice, ought
neither to be spared, encouraged, nor fomented under any
pretence of Love whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:64465:8"/>
These I shall not enlarge, nor yet offer to prove (study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to avoyd prolixity) because I presume they will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
granted and assented to by all. That then, which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
comes under consideration, is to consider and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
which of all the several sorts of Christians at this day
do most truly observe these rules, and shew forth most of
the true Love and Zeal of God in their way and principles,
avoyding that which is contrary thereunto; wherein, that
I may proceed clearly, there are some things previous to be
warily and seriously weighed; as</p>
            <p>First; when I speak of the <hi>Charity</hi> of the several sorts of
Christians, I speak of such as are settled in their in respective
Principles, as perswading themselves certainly in the truths
and soundness of them, so that their <hi>Love and Charity</hi> is
really to such as they judge and believe are wrong, seeming
to have Charity to all, and be affraid to judge them from
an unsettledness in ones self, as not knowing which is right
or which is wrong, is a Vertue of necessity and not of
choyce, and proceedeth no ways from the <hi>Love of God,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
has any resemblance thereunto, for God loveth and
Compassionates Sinners, and such as are out of the way,
not as being ignorant, or doubting whether they be such,
but as really knowing them. It were indeed the height of
madness and folly for these unsettled, uncertain, and strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
souls to take the liberty to judge others for being wrong,
while they profess they know not yet who is right and who
is wrong; being only sure of this, that themselves are not
come to rights, for they could not in so doing, but be
Self-condemned; not but I believe that the condition of
such, if they be truly forbearing, and ready to embrace the
good when seen by them, is both more tollerable to others,
and safe for themselves than those that are hardily confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in a wrong belief from thence forwardly judging o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
But this I mention for the sake of certain men of
loose, and uncertain principles, who being really Conscious
to themselves of their own unsettledness, finding themselves
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64465:8"/>
at a loss, as concerning many of the controverted Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Christian Religion, which is right, and which
wrong, and not finding a ready way to come to any certain
determination therein, and being perhaps unwilling to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
the trouble and difficulty of such a serious search and
enquiry, as well as desirous to avoyd these troublesome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
or other inconveniences which may seem to
them necessarily to accompany their imbodying themselves
with any particular People or Fellowship, and therefore
find it more easie to satisfie and please themselves with
some general notions of practical Truths, commonly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by all, and therefore cover themselves by condemning
that heat, asperity, and severe censuring that is among
the several sorts of Christians, one towards another, as not
consistent with, nor suitable to that Love which ought to be
in all Christians; whereas, poor Men, they mind not how
much they fall in this Crime, and that in a degree far more
reprovable than those they thus accuse: For,</p>
            <p>First: Are not they found guilty of the want of this
<hi>Christian Love and Charity,</hi> that do judge and condemn all
these several sorts of Christians as defective in this so prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
and necessary a Christian Vertue, whereby they do
indirectly shut them out from being Christians or Disciples
of Jesus; for if they judged it an Error inconsistent with
<hi>Christian Love and Charity,</hi> to condemn or accuse one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for difference in Opinion; why are they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so guilty of it? for since in this censuring and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
of one another among the several sorts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
is practised by them as their duty, and a necessary
consequence of their Doctrine, why should these judge them
for it, if they say they condemn them for it; Because
they believe it to be a wrong Principle, shall not others be
allowed the like liberty to condemn Principles they likewise
believe to be wrong; one of two then must of necessity
hold, either that wrong Doctrines or Opinions may be
justly reproved, confuted, and condemned without breach
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64465:9"/>
of <hi>Christian Love and Charity,</hi> and therefore the so doing
amongst the several sorts of Christians, upon their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Principles in it self simply considered, not evil or
reproveable; and therefore these men wrong in judging it
so, or it is an evil and inconsistent with <hi>Christian Love and
Charity</hi> to condemn any sort of Christians for their Doctrines
and Opinions; and if so, these men fall fouly in this Crime,
that do accuse all others for this judging of Principles,
and yet themselves judge them for their Principles here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
And,</p>
            <p>Secondly: Their envy in this is of an higher degree by
their own Sentence, then those others thus judged by them,
because the others proceed upon a certain belief and firm
perswasion that they are in the right, and those they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
wrong, and so proceed rationally consequential to
their own Principles; but these Men, Albeit they be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
to themselves, that they are not come to a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of what is right and what wrong, and remain yet in
doubt for want of a clear Understanding what to approve
and what to condemn, do never the-less most irrationally
and inconsequentially to their own affirmations, reprove, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and condemn all others as destitute of, or at least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in a vertue and quality so necessary and essential
to all Christian Societies; to whom, therefore, may be
fitly applyed the saying of the Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> to his First-born
<hi>Ruben: Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel,</hi> Gen.
49. 4. And that of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Rom.
2. 11. As also that other saying of the same Apostle to the
<hi>Galatians; For if I Build again the things that I destroyed,
I make my self a Transgressor,</hi> Gal. 2. 18.</p>
            <p>2dly. To make a judgment of the several sorts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
we must fetch it not from the practices of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Persons, but from their respective principles, by enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
how far they naturally lead to, or draw from this <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Love,</hi> because that it cannot be denyed, but that
among all and every sort of the several Sects of Christians,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64465:9"/>
there are men of divers and sundry humours and complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
some more hot, violent, and froward, who prosecute
what they judge right, with great <hi>Zeal,</hi> hast, and fury;
others of more calme, meek, and loving dispositions, who
though they be not less desirous to advance their way, yet
do it in a more complacent, affable, and deliberate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
Some there are that are naturally of a careless, indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
Gallio-like temper in such things, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
more forbearingly and civilly towards such as dissent
from them, not because of any Vertue, but because such
things do not much trouble or touch them. Neither then
of these Vertues, as they are incident to particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
are so justly chargeable upon a Sect or People, as
from thence to make a positive judgment of their <hi>Universal
Charity</hi> or not; seeing these are not the consequences of
their Principles, or that which necessary comes from them,
as relating to this or that Society, but the meer product
of their natural and private humours, how far any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
or singular Persons among the several Sects, have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the performance of that true <hi>Love and Zeal</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
described: I shall not determine, neither does it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
belong to this Question; for if any should be
found to do any thing which were so far from being the
consequence of their Principles, as to be quite contrary,
their Brethren would not suffer their Principles from thence
to be improved; so neither can the excellency of any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Persons, while not proceeding upon their Principles,
approve them as justifiable in this respect: As for instance,
where it is the <hi>Universal Principle</hi> and general practice of
a Sect, to persecute even to the utmost those that differ
from them, as in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> should there be
found one or two, or a very few of a more moderate spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that should profess an aversion from such sort of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and also practice it in their station, according to their
Capacity, who would ascribe this moderation and Charity
to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> would take his measures but badly;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64465:10"/>
and on the other hand, where it is the <hi>Universal Principle</hi>
and general practices of a People, not at all to persecute
for the matter of Conscience, should any private Persons
of that Society be carryed by their fury and heat to the
practice of any such thing, though directly contrary to their
Principles, who would charge this upon the whole People,
and thence measure them, would make also a bad conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
Nevertheless, I shall not deny but some Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are so pernitious, and so strait and narrow, that they
seem by a certain Malignity generally to influence all their
followers, as shall after be observed: But I shall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the fore-mentioned Examination.</p>

            <head>SECT. IV. An Examination of the Principles of several sorts of the so called
Christans, compared with this Universal Love, and found
defective: As 1. of Papists: 2. of Protestants in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:
3. of Socinians.</head>
            <p>AS there are two ways chiefly whereby a People or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
do signifie their <hi>Charity or Love</hi> towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that differ from them; so by these two also, is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
their contrary Principles and practice.</p>
            <p>The first is by a <hi>favourable</hi> and <hi>Charitable judgment</hi>
of the condition of Mens Souls; Albeit, of different and
contrary principles from them, in supposing, or at least not
absolutely denying, but that they may even upon their own
Principles, if faithful thereto, obtain Peace with God, and
Life Eternal.</p>
            <p>The Second is by a Friendly and Neighbourly deportment
towards Mens Persons, in not seeking to ruin and destroy
them, whether in Life, Liberty, or Estate; Albeit, their
judgment concerning God, and things Spiritual in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Manner of the exercise of their Worship, be both
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64465:10"/>
contrary and different; where the defect of any of these two
is, there of necessity must be wanting <hi>Universal Love</hi> and
<hi>Charity;</hi> for thou that hast bound up, and tyed the means
of Salvation to thy Principles and Doctrines, so as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from Salvation all that differ from thee, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
thee, has certainly declared, thy <hi>Charity</hi> exceeds not the
limits of thy own form, and that the best Opinion, and
highest esteem thou hast of any that differ from thee, for
any vertues or excellencies that may appear to be in them,
resolves at last in no better then this Conclusion, For all
this they must be Damned; neither will it serve to prove
the <hi>Universal Charity</hi> of any People, in this respect, that
some of them may Problematically affirm, that Salvation
may be possible to some such Dissenters, living in remote
parts, who are excluded from the benefit of all means of
knowing their Principles; making this possibility only as
an effect of Gods Omnipotency, and so purely miraculous;
alledging, they will not deny but God in a miraculous and
extraordinary way may bring some to Heaven; for this shews
no Charity at all, either in the Principle or People, but is
only a meer seeming acknowledgment of God's Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
from a sight of the gross absurdity that would follow
from affirming otherwise: Those only can be esteemed Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
in point of Doctrine, and truly to commend the
<hi>Love of God,</hi> whose Principle is of that extent, as naturally
to take in within the compass of it; both such as have not
arrived to their discoveries, and who are also different in
judgment from them, and that without any extraordinary
and miraculous conveyance, as being the common means
and order of Salvation appointed by God for all, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reaching all.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in the second place, far less canst thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have Charity for me, that wilt rob me of my Life,
Goods, or Liberty, because I cannot jump with thee in
my judgment in Religious matters; to say thou dost it for
good, and out of the Love thou bearest to my soul, is an
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64465:11"/>
Argument too ridiculous to be answered, unless that the so
doing did infallably produce always a change in judgment;
the very contrary, whereof experience has abundantly shewn,
and to this day doth shew; seeing such severities do oftner
confirm men in their Principles, then drive them from them,
and then by thy own confession, thou dost not only destroy my
body, but my soul also, and cannot avoid thinking upon
thy own Principle; but I must be Damned if I persist in
my judgment, which for thee to be the very immediate oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
and Author of, is certainly the greatest act of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and Envy that can be imagined; seeing thou dost
what in thee lyeth, through the heat of thy <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
to cut me off from obtaining that place of Repentance,
which for ought thou knowest, it might please God to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
me, were not my days thus shortned by thee. To
alledge the example of putting to Death Murderers, and
other such Profligate Malefactors, which is allowably done
by the general judgment of almost all Christians; from
thence urging, that as this is not accounted a breach of
Christian Charity, so neither the other will no way serve
the purpose, nor yet be a sufficient cover for this kind of
Unchristian cruelty, because the Crimes for which these are
thus punished, are such as are not justified as matters of
Conscience, or Conscientiously practised, which are unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
Condemned, not only by the consent of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
but of all men, as being destructive to the very
Nature of Man-kind, and to all humane Society; and 'tis
confessed, even by all such Malefactors themselves (I know
not if one of a hundred thousand can be excepted) and the
punishment of such is justifiable, as all generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
but to kill sober, honest, good Men, meerly for
their Conscience, is quite contrary to the Doctrine
of Christ, as has been elsewhere upon other occasions large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demonstrated.</p>
            <p>This being premised, I shall briefly apply the same to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64465:11"/>
the several sorts of Christians, that thence may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
whose Principles do most exactly agree with, and
lead to that <hi>Universal Love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> so much in words
commended by all, and for the want of which, every sort
take so much liberty to judge and condemn each other.
There are many other particulars by which the several
Sects may be tryed in this respect, but these two fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
being the principal, I shall chiefly insist upon them
in this present application.</p>
            <p>To begin then with the <hi>Papists,</hi> there is nothing more
commonly acknowledged and assented to among them, then
that Maxim, <hi>Extra Ecclesiam nulla Salus,</hi> without the Church
there is no Salvation; which Maxim, in a sence, I confess
to be true (as shall hereafter appear) but according as it is
understood among them, it does utterly destroy this <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Love</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> for by this Church, without which
there is no Salvation, they precisely understand the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> reckoning, that whosoever are not of her Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
are not saved; and this must needs necessarily follow
upon their Principles, seeing they make the Ceremonial
Imbodying in this Church, so necessarity to Salvation,
that they exclude from it the very Children begotten and
brought forth by their own Members, unless formally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the Sprinkling or Baptisme of Water: And Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
they have a certain place more tolerable than Hell
for these Unbaptized Infants, yet hence is manifest how
small their Charity is, and how much it is confined to their
particular Ceremonies and forms, since if they think Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
born among them, for want of this Circumstance are
excluded from Heaven, Albeit, never guilty of actual
Transgression, they must needs judge that such as both want
it, and also are guilty of many sins, as they believe all
men are who are come to age, especially such as are not
in the Church, go without remedy to Hell.</p>
            <p>Secondly: All Dissenters and Seperatists from the Church,
Infidels, Turks, and Heriticks, which in short are all that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64465:12"/>
profess not fellowship and Communion with the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and own her not as their Mother, are in a most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
manner yearly Excommunicated by the Pope; and
it were a most gross inconsistency to suppose that such as
are so Cursed and Excommunicated, and given over to the
Devil by the Father and chief Bishop of the Church, can
in the judgment of the Members be saved, especially while
they think he is approved of God, and led by an Infallible
Spirit in his so Excommunicating them.</p>
            <p>And lastly: To suppose any such <hi>Universal Love</hi> or
<hi>Charity,</hi> as extending to Persons either without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of their own Society, or dissenting and separating from
them, so as to reckon them in a capacity or possibility of
Salvation, were to destroy and overturn the very Bassis and
Foundation of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> which stands in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the Superiority and Precedency of <hi>Peter</hi> and his
Successors, and in believing that Infallibility is annexed
thereunto.</p>
            <p>Now such as are not of the <hi>Roman</hi> Society, cannot do
this; and those that do not thus, are such to whom the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can have no Charity, but must look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them as without the Church, and consequently as unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Salvation while there abiding.</p>
            <p>If it be objected that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> professeth
Charity to the <hi>Greek, Armenian,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Churches,
Albeit, vastly differing in many things from them.</p>
            <p>I Answer, that whatsoever Charity the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
either doth, or ever hath professed to any of these, shall
be found to be always upon a supposed acknowledgment
made by them to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Mother-Church
and Apostolick Seat, from thence seeking the Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Authority of their Patriarches, at least as the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
have sought to make the World believe (how true,
is not my present business to enquire) and all these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of Ceremonies that are betwixt them, are only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the <hi>Romanists</hi> as such which are indulged to them
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64465:12"/>
by the Pope, who pretends out of a Fatherly care and
compassion to yield these things unto them, which if it be
true, is done by him rather to uphold the shew of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
and because distance of place, and other incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
hinders him from pressing more upon them, since
in places nearer hand, and where fitter opportunities hath
been presented, he hath shewn himself very Zealous and
Violent to bring all to a ready obedience to the least of
his Commands, as by many examples could be largely
proved; yet some are of the mind that all these Stories
and pretended acknowledgments of Patriarchs to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi>
Sea are but the meer effects of the Policy of that
Court, to uphold their Grandure, and nothing better but
pretty Comedies to amuse the Vulgar and Credulous, and
augment their Reverence towards the Pope and his Clergy;
but what-ever be in this, it is abundantly manifest that
there can be nothing more contrary to this <hi>Universal Love</hi> and
<hi>Charity</hi> than <hi>Romish</hi> Principles, and that no man of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
without deserting his Principles, can pretend to
it.</p>
            <p>As to the other Principle of Persecution, how much it
is Preached and practised in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> will
need no great Probation: Those that are acquainted with,
or have heard of the <hi>Spanish Inquisition,</hi> of the many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humain
Butcheries and Massacres committed both in <hi>France,</hi>
and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> upon Men meerly for the matter of
their Consciences; the many Plots, Consultations, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binings,
and Wars, contrived, fomented, and carryed on
by the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> themselves, and the chief of their
Clergy, yielding large and voluntary Contributions thereto
for to ruin and root out the Dissenters from the <hi>Romish</hi>
Society, after <hi>Luther</hi> appeared; cannot but see how natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and consequential it is to <hi>Romish</hi> Principles so to do:
And thence also observe how contrary and opposite these
things are to <hi>Universal Love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and how much they
act the Hypocrite when they pretend Christian Charity to
any that differ from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:64465:13"/>
And this manifestly appears in these two, which none
of them that has understanding to know, or honesty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
their Principles can deny: I might also add a third,
which Albeit, by some Popish Doctors in some Nations it
be denyed, yet is no less firmly believed and contended
for by other eminent Persons among them, especially <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi>
and approved by the Pope himself; to wit, the
Popes power to depose Princes in case of Heresie, and
give their Kingdoms to others, allowing them upon that
account to fight against them, and accounting their so pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaseing
of them, lawful. Small offences heretofore would
have provoked to this Sentence, as appeared in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Hildebrand</hi> and others; but of late he is more spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and deliberate in his denuntiations, finding his Authority
less regarded, and his power to bring to obedience much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviated:
But surely this principle cannot consist with
<hi>Universal Love,</hi> when that, which by all is acknowledged
to be an Ordinance of God, doth not secure the lawful Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrators
thereof from the bitterness of it: If you will
not allow a King to be a King, Albeit, his right and title
so to be, is every way as good as such among your selves,
unless he be of your mind, certainly there is but small
hopes of your Charity to other persons. There might be
much more said and enlarged as well upon this as other
things, which sufficiently evidenceth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
can have no just claim to this <hi>Universal Love,</hi> which I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely,
to avoyd all manner of prolixity, do omit.</p>
            <p>The great variety of Doctrines among Protestants
so called, will make it somewhat harder to decipher them
particularly in this matter; yet to take first notice of those,
who by their most publick Confessions, as well as by their
possession of whole Nations, are most commonly and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
understood to bear that name, (to wit) the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi>
and <hi>Calvenists</hi> seems most regular.</p>
            <p>And because of their Unity, as well as of several others
in that doctrine and practice of Persecution, I shall make
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64465:13"/>
my first observation from thence, which being not only
held by them, but also by several others dissenting from
both of them, may be termed (the more the pitty) a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Doctrine of Protestants; how far this contradicts
<hi>Universal Love,</hi> is before-mentioned. But as to them, it
has this additional aggravation which is very considerable
that they do, and that upon their owned Principles so rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
persecute one another, not permitting one another
the free exercise of their Conscience in their respective Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions;
Albeit, they acknowledge that they agree in
Fundamentals, and that they have both upon the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of Reformation departed from Antechrist; how then
can these Men pretend to any thing of <hi>Universal Love</hi> or
<hi>Charity,</hi> who upon so small difference by themselves, not
esteemed Fundamental, do deny one another the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and natural Benefits of the Creation? And of this
the Island of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> can give good evidence: for
Albeit, the Protestants there be in a sense all <hi>Calvenists,</hi>
or at lest, not at variance in that which was, and is the
great Controversie among the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvenists</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;
and that their difference lye only in the matter of
the Government of the Church, and some other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
many of which, <hi>Calvin</hi> himself confesseth not to be
of that consequence for which the Godly should be at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance;
yet how little Charity they have to one another,
and how great and irreconcilable prejudice and malice, is
openly known to the World: So that upon this account,
the Prelatick Party has Persecuted the Presbyterian, and
the Presbyterian them, as they respectively found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a Capacity to do it, not only to the ejection of
the Clergy for this difference out of their Function, and
the Excommunication and publickly Cursing one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but also to the turning in and out of State-Officers,
to the Imprisoning, Forfeiting, Banishing, yea, and judicial
Execution both of private and publick Persons; not to
mention the horrible devastations and publick Wars, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64465:14"/>
by this Island became as a bloody Tragedy, to the ruin of
thousands of Families, which took its rise from their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
and was carryed and fomented from the very Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits
under this notion; also those common and usual deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
wherewith they used, and yet do design on one
another, are not unknown, as self-seeking and self-separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Hypocrites, seditious Incendaries, presumptuous Rebels;
and on the other hand, Proud and Bloody Prelates, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and Ungodly Curates, Wicked and Hateful Malignants,
Idolatrous and Superstitious.</p>
            <p>I could also, were it not both tedious and troublesom to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
such stuff, give instance of not much less severity and
reproaches, very near of the same quality, that have passed
betwixt other subdivided species of <hi>Calvenists,</hi> as betwixt
the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> and <hi>Contra-Remonstrants</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> upon
the difference of their Principles; Albeit, they agree in
the matter of Government: And the English <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
and <hi>Independents,</hi> who quarrel not much (at lest the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of them, as themselves are willing the World should
believe) about Principles, but only in a small circumstance
of Government, all which doth well witness how void
those men are of true <hi>Charity,</hi> and how far from that true
<hi>Universal Christian Love,</hi> so much commended and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to by them, especially considering that these are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
some personal Infirmities or escapes of private persons
among them, but the universal, necessary and consequential
effects of their respective Principles, which proceed from
them as men so circumstantiated and related to such and
such Fellowships and Societies.</p>
            <p>There is another Principle, not only common both to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi>
and <hi>Calvanists,</hi> hut even to these subdivided <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi>
I mean the <hi>Episcopalians</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> which
cannot but obstruct and necessarily hinder this <hi>Universal
Love.</hi> To wit, the pressing after, and seeking to establish
a National Church, whereby upon the Magistrates, or great
part imbracing any Religion, they distribute the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64465:14"/>
into several Parishes or Congregations, and appoint
Preachers of that way to them all; so that a man cannot
be a Member of the State, without he be a Member of
the Church also; and he is robbed of the very Priviledges
which he ought to enjoy as a Man, unless he will agree,
Albeit, against his Conscience, to every Circumstance of
that Church, which is established in the Country he lives,
for the making of which the more effectual, the Law in our
Country provides, that when a Man is Excommunicate,
or cast out of the Church, is also cast out of the State;
so that a Man upon the Churches Censure, for a matter
meerly Conscientious, incurrs the same hazard of the loss
of his Estate and Liberty, as if he had been guilty of some
hainous Crime towards the State. But how can those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to <hi>Universal Love</hi> that has thus so confined all, both
Spiritual and Temporal Blessings to their Sect, that they
think not Men worthy to live as Men, or breath the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
air, unless they will subscribe to all their Sentiments.
Surely this is far from the <hi>Nature of God's Love,</hi> that
causes his Sun to rise both upon the Just and Unjust.
Thus far as to Persecution, and what depends upon it.</p>
            <p>I observed before that the general defect of this <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Love</hi> did proceed from wrong Notions concerning the
<hi>Love of God;</hi> for such as confined <hi>God's Love,</hi> did conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially
confine their own. Now the chief way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
men by their own narrow Opinions, seek to limit and
confine the <hi>Universal Love of God,</hi> is by proposing the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
means of Salvation appointed by God, as not reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to all, for such, to whom they reach not, we cannot
suppose to have any real Love extended to them: In this
the generality of Protestants are deficient; Albeit, some
exceed others in a particular respect, as shall be hereafter
observed.</p>
            <p>That wherein they are generally wanting, is by affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there can be no Salvation without the explicit
knowledge of Christ, and benefit of the Scriptures. This
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64465:15"/>
is held both by <hi>Lutherans, Calvenists,</hi> and <hi>Arminians;</hi> I
mean by these Churches, whatever may be the private Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of particular persons among them.</p>
            <p>Now whereas all these do acknowledge that many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,
yea, whole Nations, have been, and are excluded
from the benefit of this knowledge, they must necessarily
conclude Salvation impossible to them, and so they can
have no Charity for them, so as to suppose a possibility of
Salvation to them. And this goes directly against, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
the nature of <hi>Universal Love,</hi> which cannot be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
towards any, but upon the supposition that they
are under a possibility of being saved, or that those circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
they are under, not being in themselves, simply
considered sinful as being such, as is not in them to help,
do not absolutely exclude them from it: I confess that I
cannot have Charity to a wicked Man, that he can be saved
so long as he continues wicked; and if thence any should
seek to infer, that so likewise we cannot have Charity to
those men that want the Scriptures, and the outward know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Christ, that they can be saved so long as they
want that. Therefore as the one is not contrary to <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Love,</hi> neither is the other. I Answer: The Comparison
holds not at all, because the ground of my not having Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to him, is his continuing in a thing which himself
knows to be displeasing to God, by the Law of God which
he has revealed to him, and acknowledges to be good;
and therefore the ground of my hopes of him, that he may
be saved if he Repents, is, because he knows the means
how to Repent, and be Converted; so my <hi>Universal Love,</hi>
reaches to him not only in that I believe 'tis possible for
God to bring him out of his Wickedness; but in that I
acknowledge that God in order thereto, has actually made
manifest to him the way how he may be Converted, and
so I exclude him not from the <hi>Universal Love of God,</hi> which
I suppose in that manifestation of his will, to have already
really, touched and reached him. But the other case has
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64465:15"/>
no parity with this; for first, that defect of the Scriptures
and outward knowledge of Christ in an <hi>Indian</hi> or <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
&amp;c. is no wilful malitious act of them against any Law
known to them, but is the meer providence of God by them
inevitable; neither is it unto them any moral evil, that they
are born or brought up in these parts, or come not to those
places where they may learn and find that knowledge: If I
then judge that <hi>God's Love</hi> reaches not any such, whom by
this Providence he has permitted to be thus Born and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated
in order to save them, my <hi>Universal Love</hi> can no
ways reach to them, so as to suppose Salvation possible to
them, not because they refuse or resist the means of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Salvation appointed to them of God, but because
they want it by the will of God, who thought not meet
to give it to them, I look not upon it as my work in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
to refute this Doctrine, and shew its Contrariety to
Truth and Scripture, having done that largely else-where,
as in my Apology, Expl. of the 5th. and 6th. Proposition;
it is enough here that I shew that such as hold this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
cannot justly pretend to <hi>Universal Love,</hi> as doth
evidently appear by what is said, and needs no further
Question.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the <hi>Socinians</hi> may step in here, or others of more
general Principles, who will affirm they do not believe that
the want of this explicit knowledge doth necessarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
Men from Salvation: It is true, there are some of
that mind, but it were hard to rank them under any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
denomination, it being rather a Notion of these
Men, of whom I made mention before, that are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in their Principles, and joyn with no people absolutely,
then acknowledged by a people or any publick Confession
of any united or gathered Church and People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> generally lay very great stress upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
knowledge of Christ, &amp; do believe the outward knowledge
of Christ, or of the Resurrection at least, to be absolutely needful,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64465:16"/>
holding the sufficiency of that alone upon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. But
passing that, and taking it for granted that the generality
of <hi>Socinians,</hi> and several others with them, who being all
taken in <hi>Cumulo,</hi> may pass, for as much as a whole body
of people do believe and affirm Salvation even possible to
such as are by an inevitable Fate excluded from the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of that external knowledge, in that they say that such
as will improve that light of Nature which all Men have
given them of God, and exercise that common Principle of
Reason, may from the works of Creation and Providence,
certainly conclude <hi>that there is a God,</hi> forsake many evils,
and do much good; and that such as do thus improve this
natural and common light, do obtain of God, to send them
miraculously either some Man or Angel to signifie to them
the outward knowledge or Resurrection of Christ, that they
may believe it, and be saved.</p>
            <p>I Answer: This doth not reach the full extent of <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Love,</hi> because it still limiteth it to this external
knowledge, and supposeth no means of Salvation without it.
And next, because it supposeth somewhat Miraculous, which
as has been before observed, is a limitation not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in this case: But if any would affirm that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
of this Natural Light proved to them a means of
Salvation, without supposing any necessity of having the
outward knowledge of Christ at all; Albeit, it would
see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by the extent of their Charity, that their Love were
very universal, yet they do not establish true <hi>Universal
Love</hi> more than the other, because nothing is true <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Love,</hi> but that which naturally proceedeth from the
true Love of God, and is founded upon good and sound
Principles deduced there-from, and which hath not its rise
from the love of Self, or from a selfish principle; which
though it may have a shew of <hi>Universal Love,</hi> is not really
such, else, he that would affirm he believed that all men, as well
the Wicked as the Godly, the Unbelieving as the Believing,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64465:16"/>
should be saved, and that no wickedness can hinder a Man from
being saved, might be said to be a truer Preacher of <hi>Universal
Love</hi> than any, and most Charitable of all Men; and yet
how would this be justly condemned by all Christians: There
can then be no true <hi>Universal Love</hi> but that which is built
upon the love of God, and is pure, and of the nature of
it: So then those that affirm that men may be saved (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
without the outward knowledge of Christ, and of the
Scriptures) if they improve the light of Nature; whether
it be that they judge that the light of Nature can carry
them through to the end, and accomplish the work, or
that they suppose the improving of it, will procure any such
Miraculous Revelation; do not truly Preach or establish <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Love,</hi> because the same is not founded upon the
true Love of God, but is an exalting of the Nature and
Reason of Man, which is really defiled, and proceeds from
Self: Since these Men, for the most part, do look upon
Grace, or the operation of the Spirit in the Saints, as
but a meer fancy, so I say these men do not commend the
true Love of God, which is contrary to Self, but only
their own corrupt Nature and Reason, and do therefore
really oppose and slight the Universal Love of God, in
that they suppose Man capable of himself, to save himself,
without Christ the alone Mediator, in and by whom the
<hi>Universal Love of God to all is</hi> only extended, for whom
ever God loves, he loves them in Christ, and no other ways;
and this Love of God in Christ cannot be truly received
and entertained to the Salvation of the Soul, but as the
Old. Man, the first Man with his deeds, which are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
corrupted, and can claim no share in Mans Salvation,
is put off and done away; and as the <hi>New Man</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from a Divine Spiritual Seed, which is not of, nor
from Mans Nature, comes to be born and brought forth in
the soul. But much more do they contradict and declare
themselves void of, and Strangers to the <hi>Universal Love,</hi>
who hold the precise decree of Reprobation, with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64465:17"/>
principles depending thereupon, in believing that the
far greater number, not only of Man-kind, but even of
those that profess the Name of Christ, are necessarily damn'd,
and that by Vertue of God's absolute decree, who from all
Eternity ordained to Create them for that very end, and
appointed them to walk in such Wickedness, for which he
might Condemn them, and punish them Eternally: So that
not only such as are ignorant of the History of Christ, and
of the Scriptures, are certainly Damned; but even most of
those who have the benefit of this Knowledge, are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
Damned also, for not right using and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same, which miserable Crime they necessarily fall
in, because that God, Albeit, He publickly, and by his
revealed Will doth invite them all to Salvation, yet by a
secret Will unknown to Men, He doth with-hold from them
all Power and Grace so to do. Now I say, whoever are
of this mind, as all <hi>Calvinists</hi> generally are, cannot justly
pretend to <hi>Universal Love;</hi> for seeing they limit <hi>the Love
of God</hi> to a small number, making all the rest only objects
of his Wrath and Indignation, they must by consequence
so limit their own Love also: For God being the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and Author of Love, no man can extend true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Love beyond his; yea, the greatest and highest Love
of any Man, falls infinitely short of the <hi>Love of God,</hi> even
as far as a little drop of water falls short of the great
Ocean. Now none of these Men, without manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
their own Principles, can pretend to have Love
to any of those that are thus predestinated to Death; for
what sottishness were it, and inconsistency to pretend Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to such so, as to suppose a possibility of Salvation
for those whom God hath appointed to be Damned, and to
be Sons of Predition; for to say we ought to have Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to all, because we know not who is appointed to Life,
or may be called to it, saith nothing to solve this difficulty,
because even to such as may be supposed to be Elected, I
am not to have Charity, so long as I see them in Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64465:17"/>
and in any unconverted state, for that were to walk
against all true judgment, and a putting light for darkness,
and darkness for light; a calling good, evil; and evil, good;
which is expresly forbidden.</p>
            <p>Next, this were to make true Christian-Love as blind
as the heathens supposed their god of their Lustful Love
to be; for I ought to love Men for some real good I see
in them, as feeling them to partake of, and grow in the
Love of God, and not upon a meer perhaps God may do
them good, perhaps they may be called, unless I believed
there were something of God in all given them in order
to call them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: Seeing these Men do believe and affirm that
God in this case appoints the end, so he doth the means
also; they are not only obliged upon their Principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all Charity, to conclude as Damned, and appointed to
Damnation all such as have not the benefit of these means
they think needful, but even all such among themselves
enjoying these means in whom appears not, according to
their notion of it, true and convincing tokens of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
And as this Doctrin naturally leads from any thing
like <hi>Universal Love.</hi> So as I observed before, it so leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and defileth with an unlovely humour, such as strictly
and precisely hold it, that for most part they are observed
to be Men of peevish and persecuting spirits.</p>
            <p>For these two Principles, to wit, that of there being no
Salvation without the Church among Papists, as precisely
understanding it of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and this of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Reprobation among Protestants, are the very root and
spring, from whence flows that Bloody and Antichristian
tenet of Persecution for the case of Conscience; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
both it and they are directly contrary and diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
opposite to the true Catholick-Christian Love of
God.</p>

            <head type="sub">Some Principles of Christianity proposed, as they are held by
a great body of People, and whole gathered Churches in
Brittain and Ireland, which do very well agree with true
Universal Love.</head>
            <p>SUch as most commonly complain for the want of <hi>Universal
Love,</hi> do alledg this defect to proceed from the nature
of a Sect, unto which they think this want of Charity so
peculiar, that from thence they conclude that it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
either for any Sect universally to have this <hi>Universal
Love,</hi> or for any Member of a Sect, so long as he stands
to his Principles, or is strictly bound up and tyed to a
Sect to have this <hi>Universal Love;</hi> and indeed this in a great
measure is too true, if the nature of a Sect be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
and therefore to avoid mistakes, it will be fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
somewhat in this matter.</p>
            <p>A Sect is commonly and universally taken in the worst
part, and alwayes so understood; where it is mentioned
in the Scripture, as being either really understood of such
as are justly so termed, <hi>Act. 5. 17. Ch. 5. 5. Ch.</hi> 26. 5.
or reproachfully cast upon such as ought not to have been
so denominated, <hi>Act. 24. 5. Ch.</hi> 28. 22. For a Sect is a
company of People following the Opinions and Inventions
of a particular Man or Men, to which they adhere more,
and for which they are more Zealous than for the simple,
plain, and necessary Doctrine of Christ. But such as are
not a Sect, nor of a Sect, are those that follow the Faith
and Doctrines of Christ, and receive and believe the same,
as purely Preached and held forth by him unto them, and
not as by the recommendation of Man, as clouded and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred
with their interpretations and additions, and so
are meer Christians, and yet true and faithful Ones too;
yea, the most True and Faithful.</p>
            <p>Now, which of the several sorts of Christians, are to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64465:18"/>
be accounted Sects, and which not, is a great Question,
and would take a larger Discourse, than is proper to be
incerted in this Place, truly to enquire into it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it shall suffice me at this time, to have Asserted this
in General, which, I judge, will be generally accorded to
by All, and leave the Application to each understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Reader; for the clearing which, there may several
weighty Observations fall in hereafter: Probably, this will
be almost granted by All; and I am sure, may be truly
affirmed, that whatsoever people hold forth, and preach
Doctrines, which in the Nature of them contradict, and
are inconsistent with true <hi>Universal Love;</hi> Such may truly
be termed a Sect, which may be easily applyed to those
heretofore-mentioned; and so, consequently, who ever
hold forth Principles and Doctrines consistent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thereunto, are, and may truly be esteemed meer
Christians, and no Sect. Next, the Nature of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's
Society, and the Causes drawing them together,
with the Method of their being gathered, does much
contribute to evidence, whether they are to be esteemed a
Sect or not; first, whose Fellowship stands meerly in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in that which reacheth the Understanding, and
so are joyned together in and for one Opinion; are only
to be esteemed a Sect, however true their Notions may be
supposed to be, for the true Principles and Doctrines of
Christ. Albeit, they do truly reach the Understanding, and
require its Assent, yet they are of an opperative Nature;
however, they may be held by one or two Members of the
Church, without working upon their Hearts; yet cannot
be held, nor never was by any entire Society, without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
their Souls, and reaching to, and working upon
their Hearts, to a true and real Conversion: I mean, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the greatest, and most considerable part, (but false Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
may be firmly believed by a whole Society, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having any Operation): for the gathering of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Primitive Christians, was an uniting of Hearts,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64465:19"/>
and not of Heads only: Those three Thousand Converts
were pricked in their Hearts, and not in their Heads only;
yea, where there may be a Dissent in some things in point
of Judgment, if there be this Unity of Heart through the
prevailing of the same Life of Righteousness; yet the true
Fellowship is not broken, as appeared in the Example of
the Apostles themselves. Now, these People who hold forth
the Principles and Doctrines, here-after to be mentioned,
were not gathered together by an Unity of Opinion, or
by a tedious and particular Disquisition of Notions and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
requiring an Assent to them, and binding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by Leagues and Covenants thereto; but the manner
of their gathering was by a secret Want, which many truly
tender, and serious Souls, in divers and sundry Sects, found
in themselves; which put each Sect upon the search of
something beyond all Opinion, which might satisfie their
weary Souls, even the Revelation of God's righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in their Heart, to burn up the unrighteous Root, and
Fruits thereof; that the same being destroyed, and done
away, the inward Peace and Joy of the Holy Spirit in the
Soul, might be felt to abound, and thence Power and Life
to follow him in all his Commandments; and so, many
came to be joyned and united together, in Heart and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
in this one Life of Righteousness, who had long been
wandring in the several Sects, and by the inward Unity,
came to be gathered in one Body; from whence, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
they came to find themselves
agreed in the plain and simple Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
of Christ;<note n="*" place="margin">Which external Agreement, as well in Doctrines, as in the Practices necessarily follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereupon, became as one External bond &amp; tye of their outward and visible Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship obvious to the VVorld, whereby they are distinguished even to the observation of Man from the several Sects professing the Name of Christ, as the true Christians of old were by their Adherence to the Orthodox Principles from other Hereticks, that laid claim likewise to be Christians.</note> and as this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Power they longed for, and
felt to give them victory over Sin;
and bring the Peace that follows
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64465:19"/>
thereon, was that whereby they were brought unto that
Unity and Community together; so they came first thence
to accord in the Universal Preaching of this power to all,
and directing all unto it, which is their first and chiefest
principle, and most agreeable to this <hi>Universal Love,</hi> as I
shall hereafter shew. And it is very observable, that as
those whose gathering and fellowship arises from this meer
unity of Notions and Opinions, do usually derive their
name and designation from the first Authors, Inventers,
and Fomenters of those Opinions, as of old, the <hi>Arians,
Nestorians, Manicheans,</hi> &amp;c. And of late the <hi>Lutherans,
Calvinists, Arminians, Socinians, Monites,</hi> &amp;c. So those
people, whose unity and fellowship did arise from their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
sense of this Power working in and upon their souls,
so that Society derives not their name from any particular
Man, and therefore are providentially delivered from that
great mark of a Sect; but as the Ungodly will be always
throwing some name of Reproach upon the Children and
Servants of God; it being observed, that through the deep
and inward operation of this power in them, a dread took
hold on them, not only to the begetting of God's fear in
their hearts, but even to the reaching and instructing of
their outward Man: hence the name of <hi>Quakers or Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers
hath been cast upon them,</hi> which serveth to distinguish
them from others, <hi>though not assumed by them;</hi> yet as the
Christians of old, albeit the name of Christian was cast
upon them by way of Reproach, gloryed in it, as desiring
above all things, to be accounted the Followers of Christ;
so they also are glad that the World reproacheth them as
such who tremble before the Lord, and who work out their
Salvation in fear and trembling. And truly the Lord seems
by his Prophets of old, to have fore-told that his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
should be so reproached; as <hi>Isa. 66. 5. Hear the Word
of the Lord, ye that</hi> Tremble <hi>at his Word; your Brethren
that hated you, that cast you out for my Name sake, said,
Let the Lord be glorified, and He shall appear to your joy,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64465:20"/>
and they shall be ashamed.</hi> Where a joyful appearance of
God is promised to these Hated and Reproached <hi>Tremblers
or Quakars,</hi> and <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 9. does more clearly Prophesie
how this Reproachful Name, when cast upon his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
shall be owned and countenanced by the Lord in
these very plain and comfortable words: And it shall become
a Name of joy and praise, and an honour before all the Natt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto
them, and they shall fear and Tremble, or Duake, for all the
goodness, and all the prosperity that I procure unto it.</p>
            <p>As the nature of a Sect ariseth from the love of Self,
and its production, so in the last place there can be no more
signal or certain mark of a Sect, then when a People seek
to advance and propagate their way in the strength of
their own Spirits reckoning the Preaching and publishing
thereof by their own natural or acquired parts, without the
necessity of the inward motion of the Holy Spirit, both
lawful and commendable; and not only so, but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
and establishing of the same by outward force and
violence: For, here is Man working without God, or the
guidance of his Spirit, in his own meer strength and will,
to set up his own Images and Inventions under a pretence
of Truths and pure Christianity; but those that dare not
seek to advance even that, which they are perswaded is
Truth, in their own will and spirit, far less by outward
force and violence, but in and by God's Spirit, as he leads
and moves to it by his Life and Power; shew that such are
not a Sect nor Followers of Man's inventions, but of Christ
alone, waiting to follow Him as He acts and moves them
by his own Spirit and Power, and therefore are no Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
but meer Christians.</p>
            <p>The chief and first Principle then held by those Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
which as I observed before, naturally ariseth, and
was assented to by them from their inward sense that tyed
them together, is, that there is somewhat of God, some
Light, some Grace, some Power, some measure of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64465:20"/>
some Divine, Spiritual, Heavenly, substantial Life and
Vertue in all Men, which is a faithful Witness against all
Unrighteousness and Ungodliness in the heart of Man, and
leads, draws, moves, and inclines the mind of Man to
Righteousness, and seeks to leaven him as he gives way
thereunto, into the nature of it self, whereby an inward,
thorow, and real Redemption may be wrought in the hearts
of all Men, of whatsoever Nation, Country, or Kindred
they be, notwithstanding whatsoever outward knowledge or
benefit they be by the Providence of God necessarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of. Because whatsoever they want of that, yet such
a measure of this Light, Seed, Life, and Word is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to all, as is sufficient truly to convert them
from the evil of their ways, purifie, and cleanse them, and
consequently bring them to Salvation. And in the affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this, they do not at all exalt Self or Nature, as do
the <hi>Socinians</hi> in that they freely acknowledge, that Man's
Nature is defiled and corrupted, and unable to help him or
further him one step in order to Salvation; judging nothing
more needful then the full and perfect denying and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of Self in order thereunto. Now do they believe
this Seed, Light, and Grace, to be any part of Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or any thing that properly and essentially is of
Man, but that it is a free Grace and gift of God, freely
given to all Men, in order to bring them out of the fall,
and lead them to Life Eternal. Neither do they suppose
this Seed, Word, and Grace, which is sufficient to lead to
Salvation, to be given to Men without Christ, for they
believe it to be the purchase and benefit of Christ's death,
<hi>who tasted Death for every Man:</hi> So that they confess all
to be derived to them, in and by Christ the Mediator, to
whom they ascribe all; yea, they believe this Light, Grace,
and Seed, to be no other but a measure of that Life and
Spirit that was in Christ Jesus; which being in Him, who
is the Head, in the fulness of it, is from Him in whom it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64465:21"/>
recideth, as He is ascended up unto, and glorified in the
Heavens, extended to all Men, in order to redeem them
from sin, and convert them to God.</p>
            <p>Thus according to this Principle, without attributing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing to Self, or to the Nature of Man, or claiming any
thing without Christ, the <hi>Universal Love of God</hi> to all Men
is exhibited, whereby the means of Salvation by Christ,
and reconciliation unto God is so asserted, that no Man is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
excluded from it, but each so reached, as puts him in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
to be saved. Such then as believe and Preach this
Doctrine, must of necessity be esteemed great advancers
and asserters of <hi>Universal Love,</hi> as those that truly esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
it, not through any uncertainty or doubtfulness in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but upon their own firm and acknowledged prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
since that doth necessarily extend their Charity to
the not only supposing, but even concluding Salvation possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
not only to the several sorts of Christians, but even
to such, who by the disadvantage of Education, and the
remoteness of their Habitation, are ignorant of the Name
of Christ; providing that this Seed, Grace, Word and
Light, which is in them all, and the free gift of
God to them all, receive place in their hearts, so
as to work out the fruits and nature of Unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and to beget them unto Righteousness, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Holiness, which according to this Principle
is believed to be very possible where the external
knowledge is thus unavoidably wanting; for albeit,
those who hold this Principle, do believe that the
outward knowledge of Christ, and these other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
which from the use of the Scriptures are
enjoyed among Christians, are very comfortable, and
conducing to facilitate Salvation; yet they reckon them
not absolutely needful, holding them only to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegral
and no essential parts of Christianity, for they
place the essence or being of Christianity only in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64465:21"/>
in the true and real Conversion of the heart by vertue of
the operation of this Light,
Seed, and Grace there,<note place="margin">Let not the Reader think strange that I assert this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and enter not upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of it (having done that largely else-where, as in my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology) it not being my business here so to do, but only to shew how such and su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </note> even
as the essence and being of a

to denominate one a
Man; albeit, he should want
a Leg, or an Arm, an Eye,
or an Ear, or have some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
defect; or even should
be destitute of some of the
faculties of the mind, as of the
memory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that other Men
have; yet such a one would
still, and that truly, be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Man; albeit, not a compleat and entire Man; yea,
those that live in the most Barbarous and Unciviliz'd pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the World, where they are destitute and ignorant
of all the liberal Arts and Sciences used among us, and of
all these conveniences which so much conduce to the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litating
of Humane society, and accomodating of Man-kind
in their living together; I say, those are still truly account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men, as having that which is truly essential or constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of a Man as such. In like manner this Principle sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
the possibility of Salvation, both to those commonly
called Heathens, and to many among the dark and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sects of Christianity, in that this essential part of
Christianity is extended to them; albeit, they want those
other Integrals and comfortable parts which may, in and
with respect to the Spiritual Man, be fitly compared to
these defects that those Barbarous Nations want, which we
enjoy as to the Natural Man; as none can deny but this
Principle is most agreeing to <hi>Universal Love:</hi> So the practice
of all, even of those that deny it, doth evidence and shew
how agreeable it is, as well to the <hi>Love of God</hi> as to right
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64465:22"/>
reason; where, when ever any of the Sects come to deal
with a Heathen, or any such, against whom they cannot urge
any thing from Scripture or Tradition, as being Principles
not acknowledged by them, then they are always forced
to recur to an inward innate light in the soul, to which
they labour to make manifest their Principles, (albeit,
they differ about the nature and sufficiency of it) yet they
are forced to concede that this is God's Love to Man-kind,
and that in this the <hi>Universal Love</hi> of God is extended
to all; so that to every one, to whom they come to Preach,
they may find something by which they may urge or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
their Doctrine, of which I shall give one singular
example out of the words of <hi>Franciscus Xaverius,</hi> a <hi>Jesuit,</hi>
whom that Tribe, for the high esteem they have of him,
term the Apostle of the <hi>Indies,</hi> as it is Recorded in <hi>Bern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardus
Varenus,</hi> his <hi>Descriptio Regni, Japoniae,</hi> p. 195.
cap. 8. where he puts down the words of <hi>Francis Xaviers</hi>
Letter, thus, <hi>p. 247. The</hi> Amargurians, <hi>before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Baptisme, were straitned with an odious and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
scruple; to wit, That God seemed not unto them mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
and benigne; who had condemned all the</hi> Japonians <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our coming, to Eternal Punishment, especially who ever
did not Worship God according as we Preached; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they said that He</hi> (to wit, <hi>God) had wholly neglected the
Salvation of all their Predecessors, in permitting that these
miserable souls should altogether be destitute, to their utter
ruin, of the knowledge of saving Truth: This, most odious thought,
did much draw them back from the Worship of the true God;
but by the help of God, this error and scruple was taken from
them; for we first did demonstrate unto them, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law was the oldest of all; yea, before any Law was
made by the Antients, the</hi> Japans <hi>knew by the teaching of
Nature, that it was unlawful to Kill, Steal, Forswear, and
other things contained in the ten Divine Laws, as was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in that, when any of them committed these Crimes, they
were tormented by the Pricks of their Consciences, that hence
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64465:22"/>
Reason it self doth teach to flee the Evil, and follow the Good,
and therefore was implanted in the minds of all Men by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
so that all have the knowledge of the Divine Law from
Nature, and of God the Author of Nature, before Discipline be
added, of which, were it doubted, tryal might be made in
some body altogether void of Discipline, who has been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
in some Mountain or Wilderness, without any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Laws of his Country: For if such an one, thus
altogether ignorant and unacquainted with Humane Discipline,
were asked, Whether to Kill a Man, to Steal, and these o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things which the Law of God forbids, were sinful or not;
or if they were not right, to forbear these things: Truly, I
say, such an one utterly ignorant of Humane Discipline, would
so answer, that it would easily appear that he were not void
of the Law of God. From whence then shall we judge he has
drawn his Notion? unless from God himself, the Author of
Nature: If then this be manifest in Barbarous Men, how
much more in Men civiliz'd and well Educated? which being
so, it necessarily follows that the Divine Law was implanted
in Mans heart, before all Laws made by Man: This Reason
was so manifest to them, that they were fully satisfied, and so
being delivered form these snares, did easily subject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the sweet Yoak of Christ.</hi> Thus far <hi>Xaverius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it may seem, that to satisfie these <hi>Japonians,</hi> that
their Fore-fathers were not all necessarily Damned; and to
shew that the Universal Love of God reached unto them,
to put them in a capacity of Salvation: This cunning <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite</hi>
could not find another way, then by asserting this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
albeit, it be no ways Congruous to the Doctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for these Antient <hi>Japonians</hi> could
not be esteemed Members of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and as
not being such, according to the <hi>Romish</hi> Principle (who say
there is no Salvation without the Church, that is, without
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) must needs have been Damned.</p>
            <p>Secondly: That Notion and definition of a Church which
naturally arises from this Principle, and is accordingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64465:23"/>
by the Assertors of it, doth also both very well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to, and establish this Doctrine of Universal Love;
for where, by vertue of this Seed and Light, purchased and
extended by Christ unto the hearts of all (it being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that Men may be truly Converted, and consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
united to Christ) it naturally follows that such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Members of the Church, else none of Old, but the
Families of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and of the <hi>Jews</hi> could have
been judged to be saved; nor yet any, during all the time
of the Apostacy, which as it is false in it self, will be
hardly affirmed by any; and therefore since such might
be saved, they must be esteemed Members of the Church,
without which, in this large sence, there can be no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
as including the whole Body of Christ, of which
Body, who are not, are certainly excluded; and therefore
it is that the Church Catholick or Universal is not so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to any Sect, Form, or external Profession, as
that those that are not initiated in those forms, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
absolutely from being Members of the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be upon refusal or resistance of the will of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
manifest to them, as drawing them to the practice of
particular things; for it hath pleased God at several times,
to require several things, both of particular Churches and
Persons, which he has not of others: As to the <hi>Jewish</hi>
Converts, to abstain from things Strangled and Blood;
and to the Churches of the Gentiles not to Circumcise,
which was permitted to the Christian-Jews for a time;
and from particular Persons many particular things have been
required, which albeit, they were not general Obligations
upon all Christians, yet in so far as manifested to, and
required of them, were sufficiently obligatory; and their
disobedience to them should have been in them a breach of
their general obligation of Obedience which we owe to
God, in all things He requires, and consequently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious,
how-ever others, to whom they have never been
revealed, nor required, might have been saved without
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:64465:23"/>
Thirdly: As the asserting of Principles, which commend
the Love of God, and shew the great extent of it to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
do most agree with <hi>Universal Love,</hi> so this People
in another chief Principle of theirs do greatly shew it; for
as by the Preaching of this <hi>Universal Principle of the Light,</hi>
they shew the extension of God's Love to all; so by
Preaching that God both doth, and is willing to reveal
his Will immediately by his own Spirit in the hearts of
all those that receive his Light, that so they may be guided,
acted, and lead thereby, and know the Mind of God thus
inwardly immediately in themselves; they hold forth the
intension of God's Love to all those that follow and obey
him; so that they neither bind up this being lead by the
Spirit of God only to themselves, nor stint it to singular and
extraordinary occasions, but hold it forth as a common and
<hi>Universal</hi> priviledge to all true Christians and Members of
the Church. Now this Doctrine greatly commends the
Love of God, and establisheth the Principle of <hi>Universal
Love</hi> in that it shew how <hi>Universally</hi> God hath offered this
blessed Priviledge to all, in that He hath given his Light
unto all; upon the receiving of which, this immediate gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the Spirit followeth as a necessary Concomitant;
for such as deny this immediate Revelation of God's Will
by his Spirit in the hearts of his Children, to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and Universal Priviledge to all true Christians and
Members of the Church, must needs suppose the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his Will necessary for them, to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to them by some other external means, as by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Writings and Precepts; in so much that all such as are
robbed of this Benefit, are necessarily excluded from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of the <hi>Universal Love of God,</hi> in order to the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Souls.</p>
            <p>Fourthly: As the confining of the Gifts and Graces of
God to certain external formes and Ceremonies, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
opposite and contrary to <hi>Universal Love,</hi> such as the
limiting of the work of the Ministry to outward Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64465:24"/>
and to a particular Tribe of Persons, the making hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Parts and Arts more necessary thereto than the Grace
of God; so that the Grace of God is not judged suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to make a Man a Minister, or to priviledge him to Preach
without those other Artificial and Ceremonial things: So
I say on the other hand, those People to the commending
of the Universal Love of God to all, but especially in the
visible Church, do affirm, that as this Light and Grace of
God is given to all, in order to save them; so whoever find
himself truly called in his heart thereby, and fitted to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
to others, may lawfully Preach and Declare to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
the good things that God has done for his soul, and
direct and instruct them, as by the same Grace he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled,
how they may come to the experience and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the same things, albeit, he have no outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
or Call from Men, be not initiated in their
Ceremonies and Orders, nor yet furnished with their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and School-education. This greatly commends and
holds forth the Love of God, because it does not confine
the Ministry unto such a narrow compass, as by the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sects it is done; but supposeth, that among those that
had not the Scriptures, and outward knowledge, there might
have been Ministers or Preachers of Righteousness, as it
was said of <hi>Noah,</hi> that he was one who was ere the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were writ; and <hi>Job</hi> was another; besides <hi>Socrates</hi> amongst
the <hi>Greeks, Pythagoras</hi> amongst the <hi>Latines,</hi> and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that might be named among the <hi>Arabians, Indians,</hi>
and <hi>Ethiopians;</hi> and this Doctrine doth very much hold
forth the <hi>Universal Love of God</hi> in the visible Church, in
that it excludeth none from Ministring his Gift, as he hath
it; albeit, a poor Trades-man, or Mechanick Men, as is
done among the far greater parts of the Sects of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
by the presumptuous Usurpation of them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly: This People do greatly commend and hold forth
the Universal Love of God to all, in denying the use of
outward carnal things which perish in the using; such as
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64465:24"/>
Washing or Sprinkling with Water, or eating of Bread and
Wine, to be the Seals of Gods Covenant with Man, or to
be the means or Channels, by which Grace and Spiritual
refreshment is Ministred to the soul; for thereby they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
not Gods Love in the communicating of his Gifts and
Graces to the application, or not using of Elementary
things, which may be as truly as to the matter of them,
performed by the most wicked and greatest Hypocrite of
the World, as by the most Godly and sincere, as do the
greatest part of the Sects among Christians, who make
such a noise of the Sacraments and Ordinances, and do so
quarrel and jangle about their matter and manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
but do affirm and believe that increase of Grace, and
refreshment in and by the Life of Christ, is conveyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the souls of all those that are Faithful, as this Seed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
a place, and grows up in their hearts: Without
these outward Ceremonies, this cannot be performed
but by such as are sincere and Godly indeed; for
such can only be truly Faithful, and wait in that place
where Grace and Refreshment, Strength and Power,
Wisdom and Courage, Patience and all other good gifts
are received.</p>
            <p>Sixthly: These People do much establish Universal Love
in that they affirm Persecution of Men, for the matter of
their Consciences to be Unchristian and Unlawful; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that as God can only inform and enlighten the
Conscience, so it is contrary to the <hi>Universal Love of God,</hi>
for Men to seek to force and restrain it, as hath hitherto
been sufficiently shewn.</p>
            <p>Lastly: They do very truly and observably establish U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Love, in that they Preach Love to Enemies, and
the necessity of bearing and suffering Injuries without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
holding it Unlawful for Christians to fight or use
carnal Weapons, even to resist such as oppose them, and
wrongfully prejudice them: As this is most agreeable to
the Doctrine and Practice of Christ, so is it to the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64465:25"/>
Love of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> whose long-suffering-Patience, even
towards the Wicked, Stiff-necked, and Rebellious, after
many provocations, doth above all declare his Love, in
which they cannot pretend to be Followers of him, who
believe it Lawful for them to Revenge every Injury, to
give Blow for Blow, and Knock for Knock, and so know
not what it is patiently to receive and suffer an Injury, if
they have any opportunity of revenging themselves, and
so consequently cannot have <hi>Universal Love,</hi> which neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
supposeth and includes Love to Enemies; and he that
will Beat, Kill, and every way he can, destroy his
Enemy, does but foolishly contradict himself, if he pretend
to Love him; and those that do not Preach and Practice
Love to Enemies, but that which is quite contrary, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
justly pretend either to the Doctrine or Practice of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Love. Wherefore I desire the Reader may make
Application hereof, as to the several Sects of Christians,
and examine whose Principles and Practices do most agree
herewith, and seriously consider whether there be any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
united Body of Christians, except these here mentioned,
who do unanimously hold forth so many Doctrines, so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
establishing and agreeing to <hi>true Universal Love.</hi>
