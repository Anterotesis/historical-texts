            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The answer of <hi>Philip Francis</hi> Merchant late Major of the borrough of Plymouth, in the County of Devon, to the false and scandalous aspersion and accusation of <hi>Charles Vaughan</hi> Gentleman.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N July 1643. The said <hi>Philip</hi> Francis being then Major of Plimouth, and having some jealousie of Sir <hi>Alexander Carewes</hi> fidelity, then Governour of the Island near Plymouth, the said <hi>Philip</hi> presently by his Letters advertized the Parliament thereof, and desired that the said Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> might be removed from his Command, &amp; (to take from him all cause of jelaousie) that <hi>Thomas Arondell</hi> Esquire, a Member of the house of Commons then Governor of the Fort of Plimouth (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he demeand himselfe with great honestie and integrity) might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be called up with him, to attend the service of the house. And the said <hi>Philip</hi> not satisfied therewith, by the meanes and assistance of Captaine <hi>Richard Evons</hi> of Plimouth merchant, who had good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrest and acquaintance with Captaine <hi>Iohn Hancok</hi> then a Sergeant, <hi>Benianda, Fuge</hi> and others the principall men in the Island, next the said Sir <hi>Alexander,</hi> and men very well affected to the Parliament, and well affected of the common souldiers there, sent privately for them, made known to them his said jealousie; and desired them to persevere in their integrity and constancy to the cause, and to labour what in them lay, to keep the common souldiers constant to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and to be very vigilant and observant of the said Sir <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and of his actions, and to be carefull to secure the court of guard and Armes if cause were, and on any discovery, to give him notice thereof, and promised to reward them, and the souldiers, liberally for the same.</p>
            <p>August the first 1643. Vpon receipt of the said <hi>Philips</hi> letter it was
<pb facs="tcp:103646:2"/>
thus ordered by the Honourable the House of Commons assembled in Parliament, viz. That Sir Alexander <hi>Carew,</hi> and Master Thomas Arundell doe forth with attend the service of the House, and that Master <hi>Roll,</hi> doe signifie so much unto them; but before the receipt of the said order the jealousies of the said Sir <hi>Alexander Carew</hi> encreased, and the said <hi>Philip</hi> was Prest by some of the said Town of Plymouth (unacquanted with the said <hi>Philips</hi> proceedings therein) to secure the person of the said <hi>Alexander,</hi> which the said <hi>Philip</hi> making known to the Counsell of Warre then there, and there then appearing only matter of jealousie, and no apparant cause of proofe against him (as is otherwayes but most falsly alleadged by Master <hi>Vaughan</hi>) and he being a Member of the House of Commons, and the Parliament being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertized thereof as aforesaid, the said Counsell advised the said <hi>Philip</hi> to forbeare it untill he should receive directions from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in answer of his Letters, which the said <hi>Philip</hi> made knowen likewise to the said <hi>Hancock,</hi> who assured the said <hi>Philip</hi> of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of the souldiers in the Island, and feared that the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the said Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> then, without apparrent and good cause might give distaste to them, which the Enemy lying then very neer, viz. at mount Edgcombe, might take advantage of, and therefore likewise wisht the said <hi>Philip</hi> to forbear it, the rather for that he alleag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the said Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> had ordered some at the Island, that if he were detained one the shoore at Plymouth, to make some signe towards the Cornish shore for assistance thence.</p>
            <p>August 20. 1643. The said order and letter from Master <hi>Rolle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered, the said Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> he at first made show as if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to obey the same, and promised to come on shore the next day, and perfect his accompts for his pay, but intended nothing lesse, as was afterwards apparent which the said <hi>Philip</hi> perceiving, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had been at Mount Edgcombe, sent one <hi>Timothy Alsop</hi> merchant unto him, to acquaint him that his pay due, and accompts were ready, desiring him to come on shore resolving to secure him if he came, which he promised to doe, but failed of, whereupon <hi>Francis Goodolphin</hi> a Member of the House of Commons, and <hi>Iohn Sentabin</hi> Esquire, were desired by, the said <hi>Philip,</hi> to repaire to the said Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> to the Island, and to perswade him to conforme to the said order of Parliament, and to repaire to London, who not prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him.</p>
            <p>August 26. 1643. Master <hi>Wills,</hi> and Master <hi>Randall</hi> two Ministers that used to preach there, were sent to him to perswade with him, and
<pb facs="tcp:103646:2"/>
to discover how the souldiers of the said Island stood affected, who on their return made known, that they found the souldiers very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and that the said <hi>Hancock</hi> with the rest of the said souldiers, had seized on the said Sir <hi>Alexander,</hi> and secured the Armes in the Court of Guard, and that they desired the said <hi>Philip</hi> speedily to come and take possession of the said Island, whereupon the said <hi>Philip</hi> having thirty boates or thereabouts in readinesse, well mand and Armed, which he had promised the said <hi>Hancock,</hi> to have still in readinesse to assist him if need were, himselfe in person went, which the said boates to the Island where the said souldiers delivered him, the said Sir Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, whom he brought thence, and left the said Captaine Richard Evons and others in his roome; displaced such souldiers as there was jealousieof, and satisfied the rest the pay that was due to them, and promised them a gratuity answerable to their desert.</p>
            <p>August the 29. 1643. The said <hi>Philip Francis</hi> advised the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the premises in answer whereof he received the letter, and order following.</p>

Colonell <hi>Gould,</hi> since deceased, <hi>Iohn Champnes</hi> Esquire, and <hi>Thomas Gewen,</hi> the said <hi>Vaughans</hi> brother in Law, and Deputy treasurer required the said <hi>Philip</hi> to deliver them the said pearl which he refusing to doe without order, they committed him to prison detained him there two monethes or there abouts, searched his house, examined his servants on oath, and having at last got the said pearl, broke open the said Cabinet, and then convayed it to London, by one <hi>Peter Keckwich,</hi> in close and secret manner directed to the said <hi>Voughan,</hi> where he and the said <hi>Keckwich</hi> concealed it from the Parliament ten weekes or there abouts, and in that time got it to be prized at a very low value, and never intended to acquaint the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therewith as the said <hi>Vaughan</hi> in his reply acknowledgeth, had not the said <hi>Philip</hi> on his comming to London, made it known, and Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> pretends that Mr. <hi>Keckwitch</hi> disburst 200 l. on the wheras said pearl to the Committee for sequestrations in Plymouth, and that he gave Mr. <hi>Keckwich</hi> at his return for Plymouth in <hi>May</hi> 1644. are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt under his hand for the same, that is apparantly untrue, for <hi>Keck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> came to London in February 1643. and presently on his coming to London, delivered the said pearl to the said <hi>Vaghan,</hi> and was by him advised to conceale it, as the said <hi>Keckwich</hi> on his examination before the Lords and Commons Committee for plymouth acknowledged and never made any pretence or claime there unto himself, and tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that if he had deposited any money thereon, and were so wary as to have a receipt for the said pearl, that he would have taken his

receipt at the time of the delivery of the said pearl, and not in May after at his going away, but the truth is, the pearl was sent up to the said <hi>Vaughan</hi>; and long after the delivery thereof, and before <hi>Keck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiches</hi> going for Plymouth, viz. in Aperil 1644. the said <hi>Vaughan,</hi> and <hi>Keckwich</hi> being both questioned for the same by the Committee of Lords and Commons for Plimouth, and the said <hi>Vaughan</hi> fearing the said pearl would be taken from him, and there being an order to view the same, first shifted himselfe out of the way, and then shifted <hi>Keckwich,</hi> away, &amp; then sets <hi>Keckwicks</hi> claim on foot &amp; the said receipt<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and Colonell <hi>Goulds</hi> Letter to Master <hi>Nicholas Gould,</hi> vouched by him in his reply, makes his pretence apparently false in severall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulers; as first, that the money (if any were) was taken up by Colonell <hi>Gould,</hi> and not by the Committee for sequestrations; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly that Colonell <hi>Gould</hi> gave <hi>Keckwich</hi> bills of exchange for his security for the money, and not the pearl, and had the money been taken up for the State, as is pretended, the bills of exchange would have been charged on the Parliament or Committee for Plimouth, and not on Master <hi>Nicholas Gould,</hi> as is evident by the said Letter; but the truth is that after Master <hi>Keckwich</hi> his comming to London, and before his returne Colonell <hi>Gould,</hi> that took up the money died, and <hi>Keckwich</hi> being in danger thereby to loose his money, Master <hi>Vaughan</hi> would excuse himself and salve, <hi>Keckwich</hi> with this shift, whereas tis well known, that there is a great deal of money due from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of the said Colonell <hi>Gould,</hi> on accompt to the Parliament, who received divers great summes of money of the Parliaments, during his being in plimouth, and elsewhere, yet after the said <hi>Philip Francis</hi> his Majoralty, paid not the commons souldiers, but made the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of plimouth to maintaine them, at their own charge, and by the advise of the said <hi>Gewen,</hi> as is more then probable, prest the Committee in plymouth, and Deputy Lieutenants to search every mans house in the towne, and to take from them by force all su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

whereas Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> alleadgeth that hee was not acquainted with the praizing of the pearl, untill after he had the pearle in his custody, and therefore it is apparent it could not be done on view, without his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and whereas he suspects the said <hi>Francis</hi> intended to get the pearle for himself, though there be more mony due to the said <hi>Francis</hi> from the Parliament, then his fortune and credit can well subsist with to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare; and therefore in a faire and honest way hee hath indeavoured to be satisfied thereof (which the said <hi>Vaughan</hi> labours to hinder, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) yet in the prosecution of this businesse, the chiefe ayme and desire of the said <hi>Philip</hi> hath been, that the Parliament might not be deceived thereof, as it is apparant was intended; and what is set forth in the said <hi>Francis</hi> his answer, touching the carriage of the said <hi>Keckwich,</hi> will bee made good; to use Mr. <hi>Vaughans</hi> owne language with a reserve.</p>
