            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To His GRACE, JAMES, Duke of ORMOND, <hi>Chancellor</hi> of the <hi>University</hi> of <hi>OXFORD;</hi> To the Reverend the Vice-Chancellor, THE DOCTORS, PROCTORS, HEADS of Colleges and Halls, AND THE Rest of the Learned MEMBERS OF THAT Flourishing and Famous University, THIS WORK is humbly Dedicated.</head>
            <p>IT was some Years since by Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation from several of the <hi>Heads of Houses, Professors,</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of <hi>Physick,</hi> that this <hi>Work</hi> was underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
<pb facs="tcp:61347:3"/>
it is therefore from You that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes to seek a <hi>Protection,</hi> which if it has the Honour and Happiness to obtain, the Censorious <hi>Criticks</hi> may shew their ill Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but will be too Weak to wound it.</p>
            <p>I must own it may be look'd upon by some, perhaps, as a Piece of Arrogance for so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure a Pen, to solicite a <hi>Protection</hi> from such a <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Honourable Body:</hi> But since the <hi>Sun,</hi> that great Luminary of the Universe, sometimes gilds the darkest <hi>Grotto</hi>'s, I presume therefore so far as not totally to despair of Your <hi>Favour.</hi> I do with the profoundest Gratitude acknowledge that an Encouragement from so many Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Persons, contributed no small Matter to this <hi>Undertaking,</hi> and had that been wanting, the Difficulties I met with were so many, and so insuperable, I should not have been able to have accomplish'd my Design. The Method I have taken in this <hi>Book,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61347:3"/>
(which has been a <hi>Work</hi> of Seventeen Years) is chiefly to relate <hi>Matter of Fact;</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving seen the Misfortunes of many, in swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their Books with Digressive Quotations, and Chimerical Hypotheses, and as the <hi>French</hi> observe, frequently losing the Truth by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. I can solace my self with this, that I dread not to be Contradicted in any Instance I have mentioned, having been Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically Curious in each <hi>Observation</hi> and <hi>Experiment,</hi> and those frequently repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is my Hopes that several <hi>Matters</hi> in the following <hi>Sheets</hi> may occur, that in future Ages may not only tend to the <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> of those <hi>Counties,</hi> but the <hi>Improvement</hi> of <hi>Natural History,</hi> and the general <hi>Good</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> no <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> in <hi>England</hi> affording so great a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of <hi>Mines, Minerals</hi> and <hi>Mettals,</hi> with other choice <hi>Products,</hi> and the most

            <p>THERE are particular Spirits in <hi>Mankind</hi> which soar above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="tcp:61347:5"/>
Level: Hence it is, that true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of Learning and Honour, have such an Influence over those who move in a lower <hi>Orb,</hi> that they are enabled by that borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lustre, to dart such Reflections, as raise some Sort of Men to that Pitch of Thought, that can allure them to the Perusal of a Book.</p>
            <p>So little, indeed, by a great many is Learning esteem'd, and a Publick Good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, that an <hi>Author</hi> like an Ass in the <hi>Indies,</hi> may be overloaden with Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; but the Brambles in his tedious Fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, are frequently his Recompence: The <hi>Poets,</hi> how unhappy soever they may have been upon other Accounts, have had their <hi>Moecenas</hi>'s in all Ages, to guard them from the Fury of the <hi>Criticks;</hi> while the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,</hi>

generally like Truth, the Object of his Intentions and Discourse, comes into the World naked: It's only his Innocence and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity that skreens him from their Malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Censures; but to add Lustre and Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to his Performances, is to derive it from the Patronage of the <hi>Great,</hi> which gives to 'em (if the Metaphor be not too uncouth) a kind of Perpetual Living.</p>
            <p>Since therefore, so many Noble <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages</hi> and Worthy <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> have been pleased so far to incourage this <hi>Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi> by honouring both it and me with your Generous <hi>Subscriptions;</hi> I hope you will pardon this in me, who cannot but now, and ever shall acknowledge it with the deepest

            <head>THE EPISTLE TO THE Candid Reader.</head>
            <p>I Cannot but be conscious to my self that several Errors may occur in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Work,</hi> which have slipt my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; but in relation to those, I have only this to say, as an Apology for my self, the Work consisting of that Variety of Subjects, I had so many different Persons to deal with, I could not give that attendance to the Press, which otherwise I would have done; and that if any material ones be met with, they are not mine.</p>
            <p>There are some of the Plates which are figured twice over, but those being wrought off while I was in <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Error could not be rectify'd, but those are ranged in the Book with their proper Explications, so that the Fault is not material. It is said of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes,</hi> when he gave the <hi>Athenians</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61347:7"/>
an Account how their Ancestors fought by Land at <hi>Marathon,</hi> and by Sea at <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> he took not the least Notice of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Victorious, but all he aim'd at, was to conceal that Tragical one at <hi>Chaeronea.</hi> If therefore the candid Reader in the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Work meets with any thing which may be of Use or Divertisement to him, I hope he'll be so benign, as to erase, or at least cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Errors, since the <hi>Author,</hi> though he may be apt to flatter himself, to have been in some measure happy in the Former, may be as unfortunate in the Latter. The Design of the whole Work is briefly recited in the <hi>Preface;</hi> to that therefore I refer him, and shall not presume upon his Patience by Harangues and Repetitions; but subscribe my self,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>SO different are the Tempers of Men, and so various the Impressions made upon their Minds, that as it would be an high piece of Folly in me to expect the Favours of all; so on the other hand, 'tis equally pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be arm'd against the Criticisms of many, who will be apt to quarrel with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Things contain'd in this</hi> Work; <hi>the Method whereof, (wherein I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to be as concise as I could, having e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded Quotations from others, as far as the Subject would bear,) I shall briefly touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having first premised, that what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited therein, is chiefly from my own Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Experiments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> Work <hi>therefore is divided into Three Books, the First relating to</hi> Natural Philosophy; <hi>the Second chiefly</hi> Physick;
<pb facs="tcp:61347:8"/>
               <hi>and the Third, the</hi> British, Phoenician, Armenian, Greek <hi>and</hi> Roman <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of these Counties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for the First, There is an Account given therein of the various Temperatures of the Air in those Parts, with the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Effects it has upon Humane Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other Animals: The Pressure of the Air is likewise fully examin'd, and it's made highly probable from various Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the Ascent of the</hi> Mercury <hi>in Glass-Tubes is not made by an External Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure upon the Surface of the</hi> Quicksilver <hi>contained in the Cup, but by the various Elasticities of the Air in the Top of the Tube.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Rise of</hi> Rivers, Meeres, Lakes, Ponds <hi>and</hi> Springs, <hi>with the Origin of them, is here accounted for; the Principles of</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waters <hi>from divers Experiments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated; a full Account of Hot and Cold</hi> Baths, <hi>and in those Waters the different Causes of Heat and Cold assign'd, with their

various Effects upon</hi> Humane Bodies.</p>

               <hi>Likewise, there is an</hi> Enquiry <hi>made into the different sorts of</hi> Earth <hi>and</hi> Coals <hi>here met with, with the Methods of Improving them, and the several Manufactures that are or may be made from them; the</hi> Mosses <hi>or</hi> Morasses, <hi>in respect to their Nature and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation, from the Plants that grow upon them, are examined, with the different</hi> Trees <hi>found in them, and divers other</hi> Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena'<hi>s: An</hi> Universal Deluge <hi>is fully demonstrated from several</hi> Topicks; <hi>but that there was a total</hi> Dissolution <hi>of the whole</hi> Strata <hi>of the</hi> Earth <hi>at that time, is proved impossible, both from</hi> Scripture <hi>and</hi> Observations <hi>in</hi> Nature: <hi>Whence 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Dr.</hi> Woodward'<hi>s Hypothesis is Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, as is likewise that of the</hi> Theorist.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have farther considered the different</hi> Minerals <hi>and</hi> Mettals, <hi>made various</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments <hi>upon them, and have not past over the Methods of discovering an Essay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; the</hi> Mineral Damps <hi>are also
<pb facs="tcp:61347:9"/>
examined, with a full Account of their Causes and Effects; so are the</hi> Diamonds <hi>cast up by the</hi> Moles, <hi>and the Vegetation of</hi> Sea-Plants <hi>briefly, but fully illustrated: There is a concise Account given of the</hi> Physical-Plants, <hi>with a</hi> Rationale <hi>of their Effects and Tastes, and the Poisonous Plants ranged in their different Classes, with an Account of their Causes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Generation of</hi> Fishes, <hi>with the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Kinds of them, the Formation of</hi> Shells, <hi>and the Vegetation of</hi> Pearls <hi>are enquired into, and solved; besides which, you have a Description given of</hi> Mineral plants, Shells, Fish Bones, Teeth <hi>and</hi> Formed-stones, <hi>with the Causes of them; to which is added an Account of</hi> Animal-Shells, <hi>and</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous Skeletons, <hi>Foreign to this Island; as the</hi> Stag <hi>of</hi> Canada, <hi>the</hi> Elk, Hippopotamus <hi>or Sea-Horse, together with some</hi> American <hi>Canoes found upon the Draining of</hi> Martin Meer <hi>in</hi> Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire. <hi>Neither have I overlook'd the</hi> Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils,
<pb facs="tcp:61347:9"/>
Infects <hi>and</hi> Birds <hi>of these Parts, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the</hi> Barnacle. <hi>And for the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupeds, <hi>they are likewise described, and divers Experiments and Observations made upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Second Book treats chiefly of</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers <hi>both</hi> Chronick <hi>and</hi> Acute; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides which, it contains an Account of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that have been Eminent for</hi> Arms, Arts, Professions, Sciences, <hi>and</hi> Trades; <hi>for Erecting</hi> Hospitals, Colleges, <hi>and other noted Acts of</hi> Charity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Third and Last Book relates to</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, <hi>wherein you will find divers</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Altars, Sacrificing-Vessels, Coins, Fibulae, Lamps, Urns, Tyles, Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, Signets, Pagods, <hi>&amp;c. found in these Counties, described and explain'd: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it's next to a Demonstration from the</hi> Armenian, British <hi>and</hi> Phoenician <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages compared together and examined, their</hi> Deities, <hi>the</hi> Asiatick <hi>Manner of Fighting, the</hi> Eastern <hi>aud</hi> British <hi>Way of
<pb facs="tcp:61347:10"/>
computing</hi> Time, <hi>the</hi> Reverse <hi>of a</hi> Coin <hi>and divers other Things, that not only shew these Counties, but the whole Island was chiefly and primarily inhabited by Colonies from</hi> Asia <hi>long before either the</hi> Greeks <hi>or</hi> Romans <hi>came hither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for the</hi> Cutts <hi>of the Coins and other Curiosities contained herein, which will be found to be numerous, I have not declined the Charge of having them drawn and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven by the best</hi> Artists <hi>I could meet with, and I do not doubt but it will appear to be so to the Iudicious Eye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I hope, I shall not be reputed guilty of</hi> Tautology <hi>and</hi> Impertinence, <hi>because I have recapitulated some Things now and then for the further Illustration of other Matters: And for the Language I have only this to say, that I have endeavour d to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapt my Expression to the Nature of my Subject, and that in writing of</hi> Philosophy, Physick <hi>and</hi> Antiquity, <hi>the Embelish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of</hi> Classick <hi>Eloquence is not much to
<pb facs="tcp:61347:10"/>
be expected, since those must be exprest in Terms peculiar to themselves, and to do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise were to grasp at a Cloud instead of</hi> Juno, <hi>and instead of reciting the Fact only express the Shadow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But after all that has or could be said, I know there are some Men of that assuming Temper, that there is nothing grateful to them which is not their own; but how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly they usurp that Authority</hi> I <hi>leave to their own Consideration, and shall only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the Impartial and Unbiassed to satisfie themselves with the Truth of any Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion recited in this Book, and I shall not then despair of their favourable Opinion of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is one Thing more that</hi> I <hi>cannot but take Notice of, and that is, the Unfair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of some Modern Authors in laying down</hi> Theorems <hi>upon Experiments which were not their own, and not acknowledging from whom they had them: And this may be observed in the</hi> Natural History <hi>of</hi> Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire,
<pb facs="tcp:61347:11"/>
               <hi>and a late</hi> Latin <hi>Piece concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Digestion, <hi>as will appear by Two Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters inserted in this</hi> Book. <hi>I might enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate more Failings incident to the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the Age, but I shall endeavour to evade the Calumny, of erecting a Porch larger than the Building, and shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proceed to the First Chapter.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Ancient <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> and of the <hi>Air</hi> in those Counties.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>LANCASHIRE, my Native Soil, hath its Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from <hi>Lancaster,</hi> the County Town, an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Corporation, in which there are many and spacious Buildings: It is Situated upon the River <hi>Lune,</hi> of which I shall have occasion to treat hereafter. This Country was formerly Inhabited by the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> who settled behind the Mountains, towards the Western Ocean: From what Country these Men came is not very certain, (as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> affirms) some deriving them from <hi>Spain,</hi> others from the <hi>Alps,</hi> and a third sort giving them that Name from the Piracies they committed, as the <hi>French:</hi> However thus far we may conclude, They were a Warlike People, inhabiting amongst the Ancient <hi>Britains;</hi> and the further Disquisition of that matter I leave to the Antiquaries, it being forein to this Undertaking: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall hasten to the <hi>Natural History,</hi> and according to my design'd Method, <hi>First,</hi> Treat of the natural and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Temperaments of the <hi>Air,</hi> and afterwards of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual <hi>Phaenomena</hi> which have hapen'd in that Element.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61347:19"/>
However before I leave the Ancient Inhabitants of this County, take a farther Account of them, given by that Learned and Eminent Antiquary, Mr. <hi>Hollingworth,</hi> once Fellow of the Collegiate-Church of <hi>Manchester,</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript being now Reposited in the Publick-Library there. <q>The Ancient Inhabitants (says he) of <hi>Yorkshire, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cashire, Westmorland, Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Durham,</hi> were the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> their chief City was <hi>York,</hi> sometimes call'd <hi>Brigantia:</hi> In <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s Time, <hi>Petilius Cerialis</hi> struck a Terrour into the whole Land, by Invading at his first Entry the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> the most populous of all the whole Provinces; many Battles, and some Bloody ones, were fought, and the greatest part of the <hi>Brigantes</hi> were either conquer'd or wasted.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I dare not be positive in Matters of so abstruse a Nature, but my own Opinion is, That they Originally were <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians;</hi> and this I shall in some measure endeavour to make out, from the Name of the Island in general, and the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Name of a River in these parts. As to the Island it self, as some have asserted, it was anciently call'd <hi>Bratanac,</hi> that word in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Language signifying <hi>Tin,</hi> which was the chief product of the Isle they Traffick'd in: However, tho' that may seem to admit of a debate, yet it is well known to be the Custom of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to express themselves by Allegories, Metaphors, and concise Expressions, and so the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is not irrational. As to the derivation of the word <hi>Britannia,</hi> it may thus be accounted for in another sense, <hi>Brit</hi> in the <hi>British</hi> Language signifies Paint, and all our Historians agree the <hi>Britains</hi> were a painted People; and, as is imagined, made use of the Juice of <hi>Glastum</hi> or <hi>Woad,</hi> and the Land at that time probably had no other Name save that Monosyllable: But upon the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> arrival to Trade upon their Coasts, which chiefly they did in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> where the <hi>Tin</hi> Mines were discover'd, and whose Inhabitants were call'd by the Greeks <hi>Cassiterides;</hi> it is very likely then their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61347:19"/>
Weights, which were the Standards of Commerce, were made of <hi>Tin, Lead</hi> perhaps not being then discover'd. Hence, it may be, the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Merchants to the word <hi>Brit</hi> added <hi>anac,</hi> which in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Language is Poise or Ballance by which they Trade; nor do the <hi>Arabians</hi> differ much from that, stiling it <hi>ana,</hi> which by an easy corruption may be reduced to <hi>Britannia.</hi> As to the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantes,</hi> it is reasonable to conclude, a greater part of them <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> a People of <hi>Syria,</hi> very industrious Improvers of Navigation, since we have a remarkable River in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cashire</hi> call'd <hi>Ribbel,</hi> by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> stiled <hi>Bellisama,</hi> which word undoubtedly he derived from the <hi>Phoenician</hi> words <hi>Belus</hi> and <hi>sama,</hi> signifying in that Language, the <hi>Moon,</hi> or Goddess of Heaven, she being suppos'd to have a particular Influence over Waters, and at that time the Deity they Adored. Hence it is evident, That before the <hi>Greeks</hi> Traded into <hi>Britany,</hi> the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> had been there, and no doubt discover'd the greatest part of the Island: Since therefore a River in this Country, in those early days, retain'd a <hi>Phoenician</hi> Name, as the Greek Geographer <hi>Ptolomy</hi> makes it manifest it did, to me it seems an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Conjecture to suppose, that that Name must be attributed to it from the People of that Country, <hi>viz. Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia,</hi> that resided near it; probably in the pleasant and beautiful Town now stiled <hi>Preston<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this we may introduce one reasonable Allegation more, That these People were of an <hi>Asiatic</hi> Origin, that is, from their manner of making War, which was in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging their Chariots, as the <hi>Eastern</hi> Nations practiced, a Custom not made use of in any <hi>European</hi> Kingdom, save this Island only: This <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> found upon his Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Isle, which way of Fighting he had not met with, either in <hi>Germany, Gaul, Belgium,</hi> or other his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd Countries.</p>
               <p>To these may be added the <hi>Reverse</hi> of a <hi>Roman</hi> Coin of <hi>Asia</hi> minor, which shews the Expertness of those People in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61347:20"/>
Navigation, above all the World; which may still more easily induce us to believe, they were a great part of 'em a People of that Nation; but that will be explain'd in its proper place, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Chapter of <hi>Antiquities:</hi> However thus far we may venture to conjecture, since the <hi>Asiaticks</hi> were so great Masters of that Art, that they might easily Transplant themselves hither.</p>
               <p>For the further Confirmation of what is here laid down, I shall only produce one Instance more, and so close this Head. It is affirm'd by <hi>Strabo,</hi> and several others, that the most Northern part of <hi>Britany</hi> was anciently stiled <hi>Thule,</hi> which at this Day the <hi>Scots</hi> term <hi>Orkney,</hi> and the <hi>Latins Orcades.</hi> Now <hi>Thule</hi> being a <hi>Phoenician</hi> word, signifying Darkness, by an easy Train of Thought we may reasonably infer, the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> might give that Name to those Islands; either from the great Shadows of their <hi>Woods,</hi> which were then numerous, or the Shortness of their <hi>Days,</hi> many of which are but Five Hours. Since therefore we may reasonably suppose, the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were in those more Northern parts, to me there appears no difficulty to conceive, how they might Transplant themselves into <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and other Counties Inhabited by the <hi>Brigantes.</hi> Having now accounted for that River stiled by <hi>Ptolomy Bellisama,</hi> and likewise made it highly probable, that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were in those Parts, it remains in the last place, that I assign some Conjectures, why afterwards that River was call'd <hi>Ribbel.</hi> Concerning this the Suppositions are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, some deriving it from the <hi>Greek</hi> Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which to me seems irrational; since <hi>Bel,</hi> which is a <hi>Phoenician</hi> word, cannot be accounted for in the <hi>Greek</hi> Language. Others would make it <hi>British,</hi> but I do not see how in that Language that can be made out; since in <hi>British, Avon</hi> or <hi>Savon</hi> are the Names for River, which Words cannot bear any relation to <hi>Ribbel.</hi> Wherefore, with submission to the more Knowing in those Languages, it is my Thoughts, that since from the preceding Topicks, we may reasonably
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61347:20"/>
infer the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were in those Parts, and cohabited with the <hi>Britains,</hi> who being a People of vast Industry and Experience in Navigation, might from their Neighbours, the <hi>Persians,</hi> with their Colonies, send hither several of that Country. The <hi>Persians,</hi> as well as they, in those Days Deify'd their <hi>Rivers,</hi> sometimes stiling them Heaven, and the God and Goddess of Heaven: Wherefore <hi>Arribel</hi> in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Language (which is the Language com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly spoke in <hi>Persia)</hi> signifying Heaven, thence <hi>Ribbel</hi> may be accounted for, and not otherwise. So far as from the Harmony of Languages I am able to conjecture, the radical Letters in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Tongue, and in the River now stiled <hi>Ribbel,</hi> being in a great measure the same; and the Rivers then, by those People, being sometimes stiled Heaven, I do not see how that consent of Languages and History can be reconciled, but by supposing People from that Country inhabiting amongst the <hi>Britains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The more clearly to illustrate, that the <hi>Brigantes</hi> were a mixt People of <hi>Phoenicians</hi> and <hi>Britains,</hi> I shall produce but one Instance more, and upon that Head not further pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume upon the Reader's Patience. The Instance is taken from a Rivulet, a Branch of that River before treated of, stiled <hi>Ribbel;</hi> this Rivulet is at this day vulgarly stiled <hi>Savig:</hi> Now <hi>ig</hi> in the <hi>British</hi> Language being a Diminutive to shew the distinction betwixt a River and a Rivulet, which is therefore added to <hi>Avon,</hi> which in that Language signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a River, <hi>Afonig</hi> and <hi>Savonig</hi> in the <hi>British</hi> Language signifying Rivulet, from thence may easily be accounted for the Name of that Rivulet now stiled <hi>Savig:</hi> Since therefore in those Parts we find a mixture of <hi>Phoenician, Armenian</hi> and <hi>British</hi> Languages, we may thence make this reasonable Corollary, that those People lived together. And why they were stiled <hi>Brigantes,</hi> I presume may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for from <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who very likely might take 'em to be a People from <hi>Gaul</hi> or <hi>Belgium,</hi> that is, from the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantines</hi> Rovers and Pirates; since in those Countries, to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61347:21"/>
this very time, the Vessels commonly made use of for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite Sailing, are stiled <hi>Brigantines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Air</hi> for the most part is mild, serene and healthful, excepting on the Fenny and Maritime parts of the County, where they are frequently visited with malignant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting <hi>Fevers, Scurvies, Consumptions, Dropsies, Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matisms,</hi> and the like; occasion'd by Sulphureous <hi>Saline Effluvia,</hi> sometimes extremely <hi>foetid,</hi> which I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently observ'd to be so, before the approaching of some extraordinary Storm; and it is most certain, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants upon the Sea Coasts, from the hollow murmuring Noise, which is frequently heard from the Ocean, and the offensive Smells perceiv'd from those Coasts, will make as early and certain a Prognostick of the Change of Weather, as the Modern <hi>Virtuosi</hi> can do by their Mercurial <hi>Tubes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is observable, whilst this Noise is heard in the Ocean, the Surface of the Water is elevated after an unusual manner; and upon the subsiding of the Water it is observ'd, the Storm immediately succeeds: From which <hi>Phaenomena</hi> it is reasonable to conclude, the following Tempests to be occasion'd by Eruptions from the Bowels of the Earth, strugling with that mighty Element, till they had forced their way through its immense Body, which afterwards flying about in the circumambient Atmosphere, frequently occasion tempestuous Commotions, and sometimes pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Distempers. These being the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> which are almost each Year observable, I hasten to more unusual Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents; and, <hi>first,</hi> shall begin with those of <hi>Lightning</hi> and <hi>Thunder,</hi> and other Appearances in the Heavens.</p>
               <p>About Eight Years ago, in a small Village, call'd <hi>Elswick,</hi> upon a Sunday about Three of the Clock in the Afternoon happen'd a terrible Tempest of Lightning and Thunder, which produced very dismal Effects. The particulars of it were these: After several amazing Claps of Thunder, and dreadful Flashes of Lightning, at last struck thro' the Air
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61347:21"/>
a Blaze, not much unlike that of an artificial <hi>Serpent;</hi> it took its course into a Chimney, and beat down the Bricks outwardly, seemed to burst like a Squib upon the ground, and afterwards clouded the House with Fumes, which had exactly the smell of <hi>Sulphur.</hi> A Man lying in the Range of the Chimney, was Killed, and lay as if he had been sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Bench upon which he lay was split under him, and under that an <hi>Hound-Bitch</hi> Killed; near to him was sitting the Wife of the House, with a little Child upon her Knee, the Mother afterwards was wore away with the <hi>Fluor Albus,</hi> and the Child fell into the Rickets, which distorted the <hi>Spine,</hi> and after some Years, being confined to his Bed, died of that Distemper.</p>
               <p>Behind a Table several Persons were sitting, and from amongst Four or Five, only One was struck off his Seat into the midst of the Room, and was for some time <hi>Paralytick</hi> in his lower Parts; but I afterwards by a due Course of Physick, and Bleeding, and Blistering him immediately upon the Accident, restored him to his former Health. Another Gentleman sitting in a Chair near him was struck out of it, and lay upon the Ground in most violent Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in which I saw him; but by Bleeding and Blistering in some Days recover'd him.</p>
               <p>In the outward Porch were sitting several Persons, and a young Man Kill'd out of the midst of 'em, none of the rest being Injured, or sensible of any Disturbance; only one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man perceiv'd a Waft, like a Gust of Wind, under her Coats, but receiv'd no damage.</p>
               <p>In the Rooms above I observ'd the following Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena: The Chamber Door was thrown off the Hinges into the midst of the Room, the Curtains of the Bed were singed, and its two diagonal Posts split in pieces; the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, tho' fix'd firm in a Brick-Wall, were forced from their stations, but no Glass broke; upon the out-side of the Glass I observ'd a black Steam, which was insipid, and had no smell; the Brick Pillars, in which they were fix'd, were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61347:22"/>
pierced through with the Lightning, the Holes were about an Inch diameter, and seem'd as if done Artificially. From these its plain the Matter of the Lightning was in part Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous, and in this I am further confirm'd by some Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena communicated to me by several, who had made Voyages to the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> who do all affirm, that in those Parts are frequent and terrible Lightnings, in which dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hours the Smell of Brimstone is very distinguishable; and sometimes upon their Hats, and the Decks of the Ships, they find perfect Brimstone collected. Wherefore it may suffice us Mortals, to be satisfy'd what is the material Cause of <hi>Lightning</hi> and <hi>Thunder;</hi> but Mechanically to explain how they produce these wonderful Effects, I do judge is not in the Power of Human Understanding: But in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, by the Symptoms in the Instances recited, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, there was a total Dissipation of the Animal Spirits, and a Coagulation of the Blood: Wherefore Bleeding and <hi>Epispasticks,</hi> if any thing be to be done, must certainly be the Method that ought to be taken.</p>
               <p>Many more Instances of this kind might be produced, but it has never been my Temper to swell a Book with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary Quotations, or to trangress so far upon the Reader, as to tire out his Patience with Instances of Authors tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the same purpose; unless something occurr'd, that might clearly and fully evidence the Truth of an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis, or some wise conduce to the Good of Mankind: If therefore this History be compris'd in a smaller Volume, than perhaps some might expect, let such be satisfy'd 'tis for the Reasons alledg'd; and as that hitherto has been, so shall still continue my Resolution.</p>
               <p>Mock-Suns, or <hi>Parhelii,</hi> and Moon-Bows have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in this Country; but as they have not happen'd in this Generation I shall pass them over, and proceed to give an Account of some <hi>Damps</hi> which Infect the <hi>Air,</hi> in which no Creature can live. It is observable in several Cellars, especially against hot Weather, a suffocating <hi>Damp</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61347:22"/>
arises out of the Earth, this is usually most violent when any Quantity of strong Liquors are fermenting; in this I have seen Candles extinguish'd, Creatures render'd <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargick, Asthmatical,</hi> and their Tongues lolling out and salivating, and Boys thrown into Swoonings or Deliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums. The time I stay'd in the <hi>Damp,</hi> which exceeded not one Minute, I found a very unaccountable Chilness seize my Spirits, and was sensible of an universal Weakness, was deeply <hi>Asthmatical,</hi> and could abide it no longer: This is removed by Opening the Cellar-Windows, and putting Fires into the Place, which will not Burn till Vent first be given. Of this I shall have occasion to treat more fully in the Discourse of <hi>Mineral Damps,</hi> wherefore shall in this place pass it over.</p>
               <p>The next things remarkable are <hi>Hailstones,</hi> of which the Year 1697. afforded us a pregnant Instance. The Wind blowing high at North-west, happen'd a violent Storm of <hi>Hail,</hi> several Stones were Nine Inches in circumference, others were Six, Seven and Eight. In this Storm several <hi>Rooks</hi> were Kill'd in their Nests; some <hi>Hares</hi> upon their Seats; vast Quantities of <hi>Glass</hi> broke, and all Kinds of <hi>Cattle</hi> in a general Consternation. Before the Storm hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, several <hi>Birds</hi> were taken up, never before that time seen in these Parts; from this its probable to conjecture, the Tempest arose from the more remote Northern Climes, and spent it self when it came into a warmer Climate, but was driven by the Wind: For it was observable, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most forced directly cross the County, in a direct line from the Sea Coasts. Allowing <hi>Nitrous, Saline</hi> Particles to be the Cause of <hi>Snow</hi> and <hi>Hail,</hi> it is easy to solve the rest of the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> by alledging a greater quantity of those Particles collected in the Atmosphere, at those times, when these Storms invaded us: Wherefore I shall not form un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary Schemes of Reasoning upon that matter, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to what I next design; and that is to give an Account of the various Alterations observ'd in <hi>Quicksilver,</hi> upon its
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61347:23"/>
Surface in the different Tempers of the <hi>Air,</hi> and shall then close this Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Learned Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> in his <hi>Hydrostatick Experiments,</hi> and <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Torricellius</hi> in theirs, upon Tops, and at the Bottoms of Mountains, have sufficiently demonstrated, by the <hi>Quicksilver</hi> ascending the higher, by how much the more it was immersed in Water; and likewise by rising higher in the Valleys, than on the Tops of Mountains: The ascending of it in the Weather-glasses to be by pressure, the weight of the Atmosphere in those Cases being much greater, and consequently the pressure more. To these I shall add what has been observ'd by our Learned <hi>Warden,</hi> the Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Dr. <hi>Wroe,</hi> who for several Years has kept an exact Diary of the <hi>Weather-glass:</hi> He always observ'd the <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver,</hi> upon its ascending, to alter its Surface, insomuch as in very dry Weather to become perfectly Convex; and upon an Alteration of the <hi>Air</hi> to a wet Temper, to alter to a plain Surface, and in extreme wet Weather to a perfect Concave, the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Particles hanging on the sides of the Glass: By this it should seem, that besides the Ascent made by the Pressure, there is another also made by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine Fermentation of the <hi>Quicksilver;</hi> and in this I am the farther confirm'd, since <hi>Quicksilver</hi> in Glass <hi>Tubes</hi> Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically Seal'd, has been observ'd to Rise and Fall; which could not be, was the Ascent by Pressure wholly upon the Surface of the <hi>Quicksilver</hi> contain'd in the Cup.</p>
               <p>Another thing remarkable in the <hi>Air,</hi> is the exposing openly dry'd Leaves of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> which in the hottest Days do soonest grow Moist; for which no other Reasons can be assign'd, but the Exhalations in hot Weather are far greater, and consequently the aqueous Particles more numerously ranged in the Atmosphere: And this I take to be the reason why the Drops of <hi>Rain</hi> are then usually larger; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, for the same reason, the Bigness of <hi>Hailstones</hi> may in some measure be solv'd.</p>

CHESHIRE, a County Palatine, and amongst other Things, Famous for its <hi>Earls,</hi> who had a Palatine Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction belonging to them; and all the Inhabitants held of them as in Chief, and were under a Sovereign Allegiance and Fealty to them, as they to the KING. This County was anciently Inhabited by part of the <hi>Cornavii:</hi> The <hi>Air</hi> there may be said to be more Healthful and Mild than in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> this County not so much abounding with <hi>Fens, Salt-Marshes</hi> and <hi>Mosses:</hi> What is said more of the <hi>Air</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> may serve as to this Place; and as to its farther Antiquities, the following Account may be added.</p>
               <p>According to Sir <hi>Thomas Elliot,</hi> the First Name given to this City was <hi>Neomagus,</hi> so call'd from <hi>Magus</hi> Son of <hi>Samothes,</hi> Son of <hi>Iaphet,</hi> its Founder, (see <hi>Lambert</hi> pag. 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) about 240 Years after the <hi>Flood.</hi> Were this Account true, for ought I know it may stand in Competition with the most antique City in the Universe. Its Second Name was <hi>Caerleon,</hi> (see <hi>Albion Mareoticus)</hi> so nominated from <hi>Leon Vaur</hi> or <hi>Gauer;</hi> who, as some will have it, was a Giant in <hi>Albion,</hi> and One of its Restorers. The reason of this Conjecture I suppose may, in some measure, be grounded upon the following History, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon a Giant's Skull being dug up in <hi>Pepper-street,</hi> with the rest of the Bones. Upon the <hi>Britains</hi> coming over and settling there, it was afterwards call'd <hi>Caerleil;</hi> and afterwards <hi>Caerleir,</hi> because these Two <hi>British</hi> Kings were Enlargers and Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers of it, according to <hi>Iackson, Stow,</hi> and others. Before the Arrival of the <hi>Romans</hi> here, it is probable this City was call'd <hi>Genuina</hi> or <hi>Gunia,</hi> as will more fully appear from the Inscription of a Votive <hi>Altar,</hi> dug up in this City, and Dedicated to <hi>Iupiter Tanar,</hi> that is, in the <hi>Welch</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the <hi>Thunderer;</hi> which language it is likely the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> might make use of in this Inscription, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate their Conquests over the <hi>Britains.</hi> After the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had six'd here their conquering Legion, stiled <hi>Valens &amp; Victrix,</hi> it was then stiled <hi>Caerlheon; Caerlegion,</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61347:24"/>
or as 'tis otherwise commonly call'd, <hi>Ardourdwy;</hi> and <hi>Caer</hi> by way of Excellence, as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> observes, to distinguish it from the other <hi>Caerleon,</hi> or <hi>Caerusk,</hi> in South <hi>Wales.</hi> The <hi>Latin</hi> Historians stile it <hi>Cestria,</hi> that is, a <hi>Castris</hi> which the <hi>Romans</hi> had fix'd there; and <hi>Leincestria,</hi> that is, the City of the <hi>Legions.</hi> It has likewise been stiled (as is evident from the <hi>Roman</hi> Tiles dug up there) <hi>Deunana, Deva,</hi> and <hi>Devana Civitas;</hi> and these Names I presume to be attributed to it from its Proximity to the River <hi>Dee.</hi> In later Ages it was stiled <hi>Legan-Chester, Lege-Cestre;</hi> but in these Days <hi>West-Chester,</hi> or <hi>Chester,</hi> as the <hi>Greeks</hi> express it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, to denote its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to <hi>Dorchester,</hi> or <hi>Rochester.</hi> By <hi>Ptolomy</hi> it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times call'd <hi>Oxcellum, Uxcellum, Plegimundham,</hi> and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gria,</hi> or <hi>Locrinus Land;</hi> of which the Three first denote no more (as <hi>Hollingshed</hi> observes in the First Volume of his Chronicles of <hi>England)</hi> than a Rock, an Island, or Place of strong Defence; by which we may easily observe, that this was the Boundary of King <hi>Locrinus</hi>'s Kingdom West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: This was the chief City of the <hi>Ordovices</hi> before the coming in of the <hi>Romans,</hi> (as most of our ancient Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians do affirm) those People were the Inhabitants of North <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Greatness of this ancient City is still the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous, from those stately Remains of its Ruins: I mean the subterraneous <hi>Vaults</hi> in Cellars through Free-stone Rock; the Entrances into them are ranged into several An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, and by what I can learn from the Descriptions of the Catacombs in <hi>Italy,</hi> we may reasonably conclude, these to have been made for the same purpose. This Instance suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently demonstrates the Greatness of the <hi>Roman</hi> Power at <hi>Chester;</hi> and likewise, that it is probable, since by their Conquering <hi>Legion</hi> there, they had Block'd up the <hi>Britains</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> that they were resolv'd, not only to keep Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated while living, but likewise to preserve even their very Ashes together. In these Passages have been found
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61347:24"/>
several <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, as I have been inform'd, which more fully illustrates these <hi>Vaults</hi> to have been Heathen, and not those subterraneous Passages made use of by the <hi>Monks,</hi> which may be observ'd in various <hi>Monasteries.</hi> This may be seen in a Cellar in <hi>Bridge-street,</hi> belonging to Mr. <hi>Iohn Minshull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DERBYSHIRE was anciently Inhabited by the <hi>Coritani,</hi> who these were, as well as the <hi>Cornavii,</hi> is uncertain. The <hi>Air</hi> in the <hi>Peak</hi> of that Country, is more subject to <hi>Rains</hi> and <hi>Winds</hi> than in <hi>Lancashire</hi> and <hi>Cheshire;</hi> and its not unpleasant to see the Clouds riding after the sides of the Mountains, which by dashing upon them are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forced down in Showers; and by the sudden Rarefaction of the Meteors in the <hi>Air,</hi> pent up betwixt the Hills and the Clouds, and getting vent in the spaces betwixt the Hills, I think may fairly illustrate, why <hi>Winds</hi> are in those Parts so frequent; but this will be more easily conceiv'd, if we consider those Artificial <hi>Winds,</hi> which are made by an <hi>Aeolipile;</hi> which Instrument it was, gave me the first hint of Dulcifying <hi>Salt-Water,</hi> which Experiment I shew'd to the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> some Years before Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> had a Patent for doing it; who Communicated this Experiment to him I know not, but its most certain it was not his own. Having now given Account of what is most remarkable in the <hi>Air,</hi> I shall proceed to consider the next Element, and that is <hi>Water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before I enter upon that, must beg leave to add Two remarkable Observations. The first is to illustrate the Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticity of the Atmosphere: The second is a Description of a Noted <hi>Echo</hi> at <hi>Norton-Hall</hi> in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> the Seat of my Honoured Kinsman Sr. <hi>Richard Brooke,</hi> Baronet. The first was Communicated to me, and Experimented by <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Dauson</hi> of <hi>Langcliff</hi> in the County of <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> which he did in the following manner. At the Bottom of a prodigious high Hill call'd <hi>Engleborough</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61347:25"/>
took a <hi>Bladder</hi> about a quarter blown, and tyed the Neck of it very close; as he ascended the Hill the Cylinders of the Atmosphere growing shorter, and consequently pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing less upon the sides of the <hi>Bladder,</hi> the internal <hi>Air</hi> expanded it self so far, that when he came to the Top of the Mountain it was fully blown, and as he descended the Hill again, gradually subsided, so that at his coming to the Bottom it was but a quarter blown as at first; from which Phaenomenon the Elasticity, or Spring of the <hi>Air,</hi> is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly evident.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Norton</hi> in <hi>Cheshire</hi> there is a remarkable <hi>Echo,</hi> where at about 60 Yards distant from the Hall Stairs, the sound of a Flute can scarce be discern'd, but may be heard exactly in an opposite Gate about 30 Yards from the Place above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd; but moving some Six Yards further, in a direct line towards the opposite Gate, the Sound then vanishes from the said Gate, but may then be very clearly heard from the Place where the Instrument is sounded: The Sound is doubtless reverberated from the first Gate-house, and then repercussed again by the opposite Gate-house, and forms a Triangle, as near as I cou'd think, by the opposite and parallel Stations: I observ'd by distinguishing the sound in this, the sphere of Activity in Perception is evident, and cannot be more aptly compar'd to any thing, than that of Sight; in which to have a true Idea of an Object, a due distance is necessary, both as to Proximity and Remoteness, otherwise the Object is not adequately discern'd; as we may observe by holding any Object too near, or too remote from the Organ.</p>
               <p>To these may be added an Experiment no less diverting, from Two Chymical Preparations, <hi>e. g.</hi> From Spirit of <hi>Harts-horn,</hi> and Elixir of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> prepared by <hi>Vigani.</hi> Open Two distinct Vials of these, neither of them will emit any visible <hi>Effluvia;</hi> but by bringing the Glasses near to each other, you may then perceive a continu'd Cloud hang over them. I do not remember the like Phaenomenon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61347:25"/>
to be observ'd from any other Two Liquors in distinct Vials; which Experiment may demonstrate to us, the strange Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensity there is in Matter to separate or unite; but it is most probable, the Volatile Alkalious Particles of the <hi>Harts-horn,</hi> and the Volatile Acids of the <hi>Elixir,</hi> even in the Air, by their Points and Pores united, by their mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude become visible, which before cou'd not be discern'd separately: And this I think is the first Experiment that presents us with a Fermentation hovering in the Air, and likewise demonstrates to us abundantly, how Saline Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles may, and do invisibly float in the Atmosphere; but are undiscernible, till concreting into <hi>Moleculae,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to the Figures of the several Pores of their distinct Ores, where they form <hi>Efflorescences;</hi> this granted, it will be no difficult matter to account for <hi>Renascences</hi> of <hi>Salts,</hi> and may likewise hint to us, how by such Concretions of Saline Particles, Distempers are frequently caused in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. I have in some Persons in acute Distempers, order'd the Patient to hold his Finger upon a <hi>Thermometer,</hi> or small Glass <hi>Tube,</hi> impleted with Spirit of <hi>Wine;</hi> but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd nothing further remarkable, than a quick and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Ascent, which I might have expected from the like degree of Heat in any other Body.</p>
               <p>These following Observations of the <hi>Barometer,</hi> were Communicated very lately to me, by Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> near <hi>Ludgate-hill</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> which take as follows. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Ascent of <hi>Mercury</hi> in the <hi>Barometer,</hi> is in a great measure made by pressure; but whether that pressure be from the circumambient Atmosphere, upon the superficies of the <hi>Mercury</hi> contain'd in the Glass, in which a <hi>Tube</hi> containing <hi>Mercury</hi> is immers'd; or from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Elasticities of the <hi>Air,</hi> that implete the Top of the <hi>Tube,</hi> is the next Thing that merits our Enquiry. For my part I cannot but adhere to the latter <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> since the subsequent Experiments seem to demonstrate it: As first, Let there be immers'd a <hi>Mercurial Tube,</hi> in another
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61347:26"/>
of a larger size, containing <hi>Quicksilver;</hi> the smaller <hi>Tube</hi> is to be annex'd to the end of a <hi>Trabea,</hi> the opposite end of which is ballanced by a Weight or <hi>Pondus,</hi> that keeps those Two <hi>in Aequilibrio;</hi> so that the smallest pressure upon the Superficies of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> contain'd in the larger <hi>Tube,</hi> in which the small One is immers'd, depresses it; thence it must necessarily follow, as the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the smaller <hi>Tube</hi> ascends, the larger must subside, and alter the Equilibrium, were the pressure upon the Superficies of the <hi>Mercury</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Dish. The contrary of which is Matter of Fact: For as the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the small <hi>Tube</hi> ascends, the Ballance rises at the same Time, which it could not possibly do, were the pressure upon the Superficies of the <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver,</hi> contain'd in the larger <hi>Tube,</hi> but a different Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon must necessarily have follow'd.</p>
               <p>Besides it is evident, that a <hi>Mercurial Tube,</hi> immers'd in a Cup, containing <hi>Quicksilver,</hi> does not considerably ascend so high in the <hi>Tube,</hi> as the <hi>Quicksilver</hi> in a <hi>Tube</hi> of the same Length and Diameter, suspended in the <hi>Air:</hi> The Reason is, the <hi>Air</hi> contain'd in the Top of the <hi>Tube,</hi> has only that <hi>Mercury,</hi> contain'd within the small <hi>Tube</hi> to raise, and not that contain'd in the Dish, which doubtless must clog its Spring, or Elasticity.</p>
               <p>To these may be added a Third Experiment, and that is, Let Two <hi>Tubes</hi> of equal Size and Diameter, be immers'd in Two Cups containing <hi>Mercury;</hi> the one a plain simple <hi>Tube,</hi> the other in the form of a <hi>Bicornu;</hi> at the Top of this last the <hi>Mercury</hi> ascends considerably higher than in the former; the Reason is plain, because the Elasticity of the <hi>Air</hi> in the <hi>Bicornu,</hi> is double to that in the single <hi>Tube.</hi> Now were the Ascent of the <hi>Mercury</hi> occasion'd by the pressure of the circumambient <hi>Air,</hi> upon the Superficies of the <hi>Quicksilver,</hi> contain'd in the Dish, its Ascent in the Two different <hi>Tubes</hi> wou'd be the same; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of which is Matter of Fact. Any of the Curious may any Day see these, and many other Observations at
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61347:26"/>
the aforesaid Gentleman's House. I cou'd wish the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, for his ingenious Experiments, by an Assent of the Learned to his <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> might receive his due Honour: Or that our Modern <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> because the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is New, wou'd not, but upon solid Reasons, endeavour to explode it. The most material Argument against it is, that of Bladders carry'd up to the Tops of Mountains; but supposing the Air to be Thinner at the Bottom of the Mountain, than it generally is at the Top, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Spring of the Air not so clog'd, which I am positive is true, that Objection vanishes; wherefore I shall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate further on this Topick, but leave every Man to his own Conjecture.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AS these Counties are more subject to <hi>Rains,</hi> than some of the more Inland Ones, they likewise afford us greater Variety of <hi>Waters,</hi> than any One; or indeed, than all the Counties in <hi>England.</hi> The most Remarkable are, either <hi>Ponds,</hi> which they vulgarly call <hi>Meers, Rivers,</hi> or <hi>Springs.</hi> The most Noted <hi>Ponds</hi> are only Two, and both of them call'd by the Name of <hi>Martin-Meer:</hi> The Larger of which is now Drein'd by that Ingenious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and Generous Undertaker, <hi>Thomas Fleetwood</hi> of the <hi>Bank,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> and will, no doubt, turn to his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Advantage, Part of it being a fat, muddy Soil, and containing a great Quantity of <hi>Marle.</hi> Its Circumference is about Eighteen Miles, its Diameter Two: In it were
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61347:27"/>
found great Quantities of Fish, as <hi>Roach, Eels, Pikes, Pearch, Breams,</hi> and the like. Upon the Dreining of this <hi>Meer</hi> were found, no less than Eight <hi>Canoos,</hi> in Figure and Dimensions not much unlike those used in <hi>America:</hi> And in a <hi>Morass</hi> in <hi>Sawick,</hi> about Nine Miles distant from the <hi>Meer,</hi> was taken up a Stone, not unlike a sort of Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, tho' different from any other Stone I yet saw; and with it an Instrument of a mix'd Metal, resembling the <hi>Securis,</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Sacrificing-Ax, tho' somewhat less; nor unlike that which the Native <hi>Indians</hi> of Old used, form'd of Stone, in making Hollow their <hi>Canoos</hi> after Burning, and in Barking their Trees, which they call a <hi>Tomahoke;</hi> how therefore, in these Places, these came to be lodg'd, is next to be enquired into.</p>
               <p>As to the Kinds of <hi>Boats</hi> the Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> made use of, we have only this Tradition from <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> that they used <hi>Wicker-Boats</hi> cover'd with Hides, that his Ships of War and Galleys were an unknown Terror to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants here. He likewise tells us, the <hi>Britains</hi> on the the Maritime Coasts, Traded to <hi>Belgium</hi> and <hi>Gallia,</hi> by which he probably means, <hi>Holland, Flanders,</hi> &amp;c. that their Buildings were very Eminent, their Manners, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms and Politeness, like their transmarine Neighbours; that they made use of <hi>Brass</hi> Imported, that <hi>Iron</hi> was a Product of the Country, but in small quantity; but that <hi>Lead</hi> was discover'd in the Inland Counties, and so proceeds.</p>
               <p>As to these <hi>Canoos,</hi> One of which had some Plates of Iron upon it, 'tis my Opinion, they were made use of by the Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> in Fishing these <hi>Meers,</hi> and passing <hi>Rivers;</hi> not that the Inhabitants were so long in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, by burning them hollow, and shaping them with sharp Stones, as the <hi>American</hi>'s were, before the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> Metals came amongst them; which as the Missiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries inform us, with One of our Instruments, cou'd in One Day dispatch as much as in Six Months before. The <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> doubtless had the Use of <hi>Iron,</hi> &amp;c. and were furnish'd
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61347:27"/>
with it from the Maritime Ports, and they from the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Merchants; these <hi>Canoos</hi> might probably be sunk here, that they might be render'd of no Advantage to the <hi>Romans,</hi> when the Natives were forc'd to quit their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, by their prevailing Arms; nor can I imagine these an Effect of the Deluge, neither the Metal Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor Stone found in the foremention'd <hi>Moss,</hi> but that they further confirm what I shall make out after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that <hi>Morasses</hi> Vegetate, and that they proceed and encrease from the Plants that grow upon them; and notwithstanding the Subterraneous Trees found there, tho' we consent to omit them in the Argument, there are yet so many others of different Species, together with <hi>Marine</hi> Shells, and other <hi>Exotic Exuviae,</hi> found many Yards in <hi>Marle</hi> in the Inland Counties, that without sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing <hi>Morasses</hi> to proceed from the Deluge, as many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, they may fairly and fully be otherwise accounted for. As to the Instrument and Stone, they might casually be lost there, and lie absconded for successive Generations.</p>
               <p>I had almost slipt one thing, which may give us a clear Idea of the Greatness and Difficulty of this noble and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Enterprize, the Dreining of this remarkable <hi>Meer,</hi> in effecting of which there were sometimes no less than two Thousand Hands at once employ'd; so that to surmount all the natural and artificial Oppositions of the Work, there was highly needful a Person of so generous and piercing a Spirit, and so extraordinary a Temper, as the worthy and successful Undertaker.</p>
               <p>Besides these sorts of <hi>Canoos,</hi> it is unquestionably true the <hi>Britains</hi> made use of another kind of Boats, the use of which prov'd of great Service to <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> as we find in the first Book, <hi>de Bello Civili,</hi> cap. 11. for when he had pitch'd his Tents betwixt <hi>Sicoris</hi> and <hi>Cinga,</hi> two Rivers in <hi>Spain,</hi> over which he had the Convenience of two Bridges, a sudden Inundation broke them both down, and overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Banks, cut off all Communication betwixt his Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragers
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61347:28"/>
that were sent out, and his Friends marching to his Assistance, and his distressed Army. He was reduc'd to great Extremity, nor could he possibly repair the Bridges, by all the Efforts he made, the Opposition of the Enemy's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts were so vigorous on the other side. His last Refuge was for building these light Boats, the use of which he had learn'd in <hi>Britain,</hi> and which prov'd of high Advantage to his perishing Army: <hi>Imperat militibus</hi> (says <hi>Caesar) ut naves faciant, cujus generis eum annis superioribus usus Britanniae docuerat. Carinae primum ac statumina, ex levi materia fiebant: reliquum corpus navium, viminibus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>textum, coriis integebatur.</hi> And <hi>Lucan,</hi> speaking of the same thing, expresses himself thus, <hi>lib. 4. ver.</hi> 130.</p>

               <p>The River <hi>Dee</hi> is the most Noted in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> in Latin called <hi>Deva,</hi> as appears by the <hi>Roman</hi> Tiles dug up there, upon some of which are these Letters in <hi>Roman</hi> Characters, COLL.

Some allege these Words signify a divine Water, and hence a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sacred to the Gods was call'd <hi>Divona;</hi> and upon some <hi>Roman</hi> Tiles dug up at <hi>Chester</hi> I have seen that word in <hi>Roman</hi> Characters: Nor is this Conjecture altogether improbable, since in those Days divine Honours were

This River runs to <hi>Ulcester</hi> seated upon an Hill of easy Ascent, where it draws to the <hi>Trent;</hi> it inclines towards <hi>Tutbury-Castle</hi>

Now all Waters containing more or less of Earthly Particles, and in the various Consistencies and Quantities of those, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one from another in Gravity; it may be imagin'd this Water to receive its Oily Tast and Lightness from the white <hi>Marle,</hi> that being an Oily and light Body, and the best Tillage this Country affords.</p>

A <hi>Spring</hi> remarkable for its Perspiration is that near <hi>Stalo-Bridge</hi> in <hi>Cheshire:</hi> This Water, if put into a Glass Bottle closely Corked, will force its way thro' the Pores of the Glass; or the Water by emitting cold <hi>Effluvia</hi> upon the external Superficies of the Glass condenses the aqueous Particles of the Air, and so forms that Dew, or Sweat so often observable there: For my part, considering how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult it is for any Menstruum whatever to penetrate the Pores of Glass, nay even for Air it self, as is sufficiently evidenced by the Experiments in the Air Pump: I must own my assent to the latter; and this may be farther illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by the Dews upon Bottles in Wine-Cellars, which are wholly insipid, and consequently cannot be spirituous Liquor that perspires through the Pores, but the aqueous Particles of the Air there condensed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Springs</hi> remarkable for their Coldness in these Countries we have none, save One near <hi>Larbrick,</hi> which is a Water extreamly Cold, and of which I shall treat in its proper place; this Water is the Coldest I have seen in these Parts, and may no doubt answer the ends perform'd by that of St. <hi>Mungus</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have only One <hi>Spring</hi> that Ebbs and Flows, and that is call'd <hi>Tideswell</hi> in the <hi>Peak</hi> in <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> tho' nothing so Noted as that near <hi>Gigleswig</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> where I have seen the Water to ebb and flow several times in an Hour; and always upon the subsiding of the Water, heard a gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Noise within the Mountain, not unlike that obvious to us in pouring Liquors out of Bottles, only it is much louder; Conjectures about this Flux and Reflux are various, some imagining it to be caused by the return of a Stone, that in an Aqueduct hangs <hi>in aequilibrio,</hi> as the Learned Mr. <hi>Hobbs;</hi> others that a large Receptacle fill'd with Water by subterraneous Winds from the opposite part is blown over, as <hi>LeGrand</hi> and others of the <hi>French Virtuosi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Hypothesis seems to carry the greater stress of Reason along with it, yet at the same time if we
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61347:31"/>
consider the Effects Water has upon Stone, upon which it continually falls, or runs over, in diminishing its Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, or over-turning those of a prodigious Bigness upon Floods, or other Eruptions, it will be as difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how a Stone should be so exactly poised in an Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct so long a space of time as this must needs have been, so as to occasion a Flux and Reflux of the Waters, as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable in these Fountains. Wherefore I shall venture to form a different Hypothesis, and that it may be perform'd with all the Perspicuity so dark a matter will admit, in the first place I will describe the Spring, and its situation, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly as I remember. The most noted Spring of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is at <hi>Gigleswig</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> as above-mention'd: The Well lies at the Bottom of a Mountain of a considerable Height, and is almost contiguous to a great Road betwixt <hi>Settle, Lancashire,</hi> and <hi>Westmorland.</hi> The Diameter of the Spring, as I think, is about a Yard, and the Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar near the same dimension: The Flux and Reflux is not always certain being sometimes only once, again twice, sometimes thrice an Hour; and I think the Water upon the Flux may subside about three quarters of a Yard, and then you always hear an hollow gutling Noise within the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as is above recited: From these Phaenomena it seems reasonable to conjecture, that within the Mountain is a considerable Cavity impleted with Air, from which the Aqueducts that form the Spring run; and that those and their Exits are but small, and it is very probable from this Cavity they do not run in direct, but spiral Lines like those in a Worm used in Distillation: Now when the Water that ascends out of the Earth, which composes these Springs, reaches this Cavity, they must necessarily, as it fills gradually, press the Air into the spiral Aqueducts, and force it forward to the end of the Aqueduct; it is there then obstructed by the Water in the Well, only a little Air and Water getting vent raises gradually the Spring; the Duct still continues to fill higher and higher with Water,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61347:31"/>
till at length by its Gravity the Air is forced through, and then it is the Flux happens, and the hollow gutling Noise is heard, occasion'd undoubtedly by the external Air rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, and strugling with the Water to supply the Cavity of the Mountain, which is now discharg'd of that Water, but still impleted with Air; it is now the Flux ceases, and again renews as before, and so it reciprocally succeeds. Such spiral Aqueducts I have frequently observ'd in the Mountains in <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> particularly near <hi>Tideswell,</hi> where that other Spring ebbs and flows, hence it seems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional the same may be here also: However here is not any thing dogmatically asserted, nor am I so bigotted to this Hypothesis, but can easily quit it when any more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable is offer'd, and more exactly quadrates with the Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of these Springs. Now as these Aqueducts are more or less Spiral, or of different Dimensions from the Sinus within the Mountain impleted with Air; or as the Spring that fills the Duct with Water is but easy, or rapid, so its probable the Flux and Reflux becomes so uncertain, for in some it flows not once in several Hours, as in that call'd <hi>Tideswell,</hi> the Water perhaps being sometimes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by other Aqueducts, and reaches not the Cavity or Sinus within the Mountain; this may happen by several accidents, as the falling in of Earth, or Pebles, which for a time may divert the common course of the Spring, till by a continual currency it forces its passage again.</p>
               <p>Several <hi>Springs</hi> we have which are only at certain Seasons, as some near the Manour in <hi>Furness,</hi> these are occasion'd by Rains, or an hazy Atmosphere. At this Abbey are the most stately Ruins I have any where observ'd, as most beautiful Pillars, spacious Windows, noble Arches, and subterraneous Vaults. Near this place is a considerable <hi>Salmon</hi> Fishing, and a large Park, in which are variety of <hi>Deer,</hi> as Red, Fallow and White, and is by much the most curious Seat in these Parts: It was formerly possest by Sir <hi>Thomas Preston,</hi> who quitted it; and as I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61347:32"/>
is one of the Religious, and amongst them one of the meanest Order: But is now possest by the noble and virtuous Lady Madam <hi>Katharine Preston,</hi> Daughter and Heiress of <hi>Thomas Preston</hi> of <hi>Holker</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr>. Tho' this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression be foreign to a <hi>Natural History,</hi> yet I hope the Reader will pardon it, since I could not well pass by so considerable a Building.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Waters</hi> we have which cast up Marine Shells, as <hi>Latham</hi> Spaw did formerly; but that being troublesome to the Drinkers has been prèvented by laying Mill-stones upon the Spring, so that the Sand and Shells cannot boyl up so high as formerly: This is one of the best sorts of Vitriolic Chalybeates, and is remote from the Sea, or any Salt Rivers; whence therefore these Shells come may be worth our enquiry, and a clear decision of that may far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illustrate those other Marine Shells found in <hi>Marle;</hi> as the <hi>Echini, Cochleae, Torculars, Whilks</hi> and <hi>Periwinkles,</hi> of which I have great Numbers by me, and took them my self out of firm <hi>Marle</hi> at three Fathom deep, some being entire, others broken, but all soft and friable, yet grew hard as <hi>Coral</hi> being expos'd to the Air. The Decision of this Phaenomenon in a great measure depending upon the Origin of Fountains, I think it a pardonable digression, if I a little expatiate on that subject before we descend to the particular Case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Springs</hi> by the French <hi>Virtuosi</hi> are suppos'd to flow from the Dews, Rains and Mists imbibed in the Earth, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards form'd into various Currents, which are those we commonly call Springs: Now this being a Notion incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Reason I cannot adhere to it; for were this Hypothesis true, it would hence follow in the various Seasons of the Year, as Summer and Winter, they would vary very much in their Currents as to quantity, which in several Springs is not discernible. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Several Springs are found in Mines in the Bowels of the Earth, deeper than the Dews and Rains are suppos'd to descend. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:61347:32"/>
Some Countries abound with Springs where Dews and Rains are never known to fall; from all these it is evident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Springs can never be imagin'd to be caused by Rains and Dews; it remains therefore that they either proceed from the Ocean, or a subterraneous Abyss: The latter of these the Learned Dr. <hi>Woodward</hi> adheres to, and could such a thing be made out, his Hypothesis would be undeniable; but such a thing as an Abyss being no where to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in Nature, and that what Notions we have of it are only from <hi>Moses</hi> that divine Philosopher: In what sence the inspired Legislator might take the Abyss we pretend not to determine, whether the Ocean in general, or a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous collection of Waters equal to it, and keeping a Communication with it, as Dr. <hi>Woodward</hi> supposes: Wherefore we rather assert what the great <hi>Aristotle</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses concerning Springs, that they have their Rise from the Sea; of this <hi>Caesar</hi> had a clear Demonstration when he Invaded this Island, and Encamp'd upon the Sea Coasts, where by digging in the Sands he was instantly supply'd with a sufficient quantity of fresh Water, which by filtring through the Sand became sweet the saline Particles stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Sand. A Phaenomenon like to this was observ'd when that great General Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi> Encamp'd upon a Plain call'd the <hi>Mels</hi> near <hi>Hile-Lake:</hi> This granted then that Springs have their Rise from the Ocean, it is easy to imagin how they may bring up Marine Shells, and unless this be allow'd, I think the Phaenomenon cannot otherwise be fairly illustrated; but how this becomes a Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is from the Mineral Bass from which it springs. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this Hypothesis there remains yet one material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, <hi>viz.</hi> If Fountains have their Rise from the Sea, how comes it to pass that there are Springs upon the Tops of Mountains, which are higher than the Sea, since it is evident from Hydrostatick Experiments Water will not naturally rise above its level. To this I answer, in the first place it is no wise demonstrable that there is any Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61347:33"/>
higher than the highest part of the Ocean, since it is suppos'd to be a Globe of equal Magnitude with the Earth. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Granting it were so, yet it is probable those Mountains lying in the middle Region, a sufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of aqueous Particles might be imbibed by the Earth to produce Springs there, and yet this particular Instance does no ways invalidate the general Hypothesis, in which is meant the generality of Springs, and not each particular Fountain. It is true subterraneous Eruptions of Waters especially after Earthquakes, as at <hi>Port-Royal</hi> in <hi>Iamaica,</hi> and at <hi>Kirby</hi> in <hi>Furness</hi> in <hi>Lancashire</hi> have happen'd, which have drove down Houses, and Rocks of that magnitude, that many Teams of Oxen could not move, by which it may be concluded there is a subterraneous Abyss of Waters: To this I say, it is not certain whether these come from the Ocean, or from an Abyss, and shall not therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to determine it, but shall proceed to what I next pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, and that is to treat of <hi>Mineral Waters:</hi> In doing of which I begin with those impregnated with <hi>Vitriol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Vitriol</hi> Spring in the Kennel-Pits at <hi>Haigh,</hi> when I first try'd it, yielded an Ounce of <hi>Vitriol</hi> from a Quart of <hi>Water;</hi> nay it was so highly impleted with <hi>Vitriol,</hi> that any common <hi>Alkaly</hi> wou'd raise a Fermentation with it, and cause a Precipitation: The <hi>Vitriol</hi> it yields is White for the greatest part, tho' there is some Green mix'd with it; it is not now of that strength several fresh Springs having broken in, which yet might easily be diverted; of this the Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Dr. <hi>Wroe</hi> our Warden has been frequently an Eye-witness: Notwithstanding this Dr. <hi>Lister</hi> with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal'd Assurance tells the World <hi>Vitriol</hi> is not to be found in any Waters in <hi>England,</hi> but that all Waters of a Vitriolic Taste are only impregnated with a <hi>Pyrites</hi> (which we vulgarly call <hi>Fire-Stone)</hi> Germinating in the Waters; and this must be impos'd upon the World as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly, as if it was an Article of Faith in Philosophy: For any Man to oppose him he brands him strait with
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61347:33"/>
the Character of Mean and Impudent, and such like oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious Epithets, a Language, if I mistake not, unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for one of his Gown and Dignity: For my part what I relate is matter of Fact, and the Dr. may be fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd if he pleases, if not it is no fault of mine; and since I cannot as firmly believe the Germination of the <hi>Pyrites</hi> in our Chalybeat Waters (as they are commonly called) to be like that of <hi>Mint</hi> in Bottles of Water, I hope the Dr. will pardon my Infidelity till he give me better grounds for it, at which he has not yet offer'd any farther than a capricious <hi>ipse dixit.</hi>

               <p>Adjacent to a Place call'd <hi>Humblesco-Green,</hi> in a small Farm in <hi>Maudsley</hi> is a <hi>Spring</hi> impregnated with Sulphur and a Marine Salt; the Water is extremely foetid, tinges Silver a Copper colour by its Sulphur; in Distillation a Quart of Water yields half an Ounce of sulphur Salt. This Spring no question would answer all the Intentions of the sulphur Water near <hi>Knaseborough</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> either as to Bathing or Drinking; and no doubt by the addition of Rock Salt might be made an advantageous Salt-work, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Coals so convenient. The Salt at the first boyling is brown and foetid, but dissolv'd and evaporated again makes as good a Salt as any I have seen; it springs out of <hi>Bass</hi> and has I presume from that its sulphureous and saline Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles: The various Kinds of <hi>Bass</hi> I shall discourse of in their proper place, and there shew how they are impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with different Principles.</p>
               <p>There are other Springs that arise out of <hi>Bass,</hi> and are sulphureous and saline yet different from the former, as St. <hi>Anne's,</hi> and the hot Baths at <hi>Buxton</hi> in <hi>Derbyshire;</hi> here the Waters are sulphureous and saline, yet not foetid, but very palatable, because in these Waters the Sulphur is not united with any Vitriolic Particles, or but very few saline, it tinges not Silver, nor is Purgative, by reason its saline Parts are dispensed in such small proportions, which saline Particles make up a compound Salt constituted of a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61347:34"/>
marine Salt, and the <hi>Sal Catharticum Amarum,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the <hi>Nitrum Calcarium,</hi> that impregnates <hi>Epsom, Northall, Dulech,</hi> and the rest of the Purging-Waters in those Parts. These Waters if drank create a good Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, open Obstructions, and no doubt, if mix'd with the Chalybeat Waters that are there, may answer all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the <hi>Bath Waters</hi> in <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> and that of St. <hi>Vincent</hi>'s near <hi>Bristol</hi> so noted for Curing the <hi>Diabetes,</hi> of which I have seen several Instances in these Parts; and likewise for Curing of <hi>Bloody Urines</hi> arising from the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Urinary Vessels, of which I saw a most noted Instance in <hi>Leverpool.</hi> This <hi>Bath</hi> is of a temperate Heat, and without question by reverberating the <hi>Halitus,</hi> might be brought to any degree of Heat; but I think in its own natural Heat it may in general be said to be more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Constitutions of those Parts, and where the hot Baths cannot be safely used this may. This last Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer I saw remarkable Instances of its Effects in <hi>scorbutick Rheumatisms,</hi> in Persons that could not go before without the help of Crutches, who came from thence to <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> on Foot without them, distant from <hi>Buxton</hi> full sixteen Northern Miles.</p>
               <p>But the Virtues as well as Use of <hi>Bathing</hi> are so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly described by my Honoured Friend Sir <hi>Iohn Floyer</hi> of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> that for your further satisfaction I refer you to his elaborate Piece, and shall only abridge those Cases he recites. These hot Baths spring out of a <hi>Bass</hi> not unlike Marble, and it is pleasant to see in what Bubbles the sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous <hi>Halitus</hi> breaks out of its Matrix, and impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates the Waters. After our worthy Author had given us a most exact Account of <hi>Perspiration,</hi> from his Own and <hi>Sanctorius</hi>'s Observations (in rightly considering which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists the Basis and Usefulness of all <hi>Bathing)</hi> in the first place he enumerates the Mischiefs of the hot Baths.</p>
               <p>In his 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Part, p. 2. <q>I observ'd (says he) that many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons came to the hot Baths at <hi>Bathe</hi> without any good
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61347:34"/>
Advice; or they who came with it used it indiscreetly, and imprudently manag'd their <hi>Bathing,</hi> by using it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any due Evacuation, or continuing it too long, that they went from thence worse than they came; some ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enflamed their Blood, and thicken'd its <hi>Serum,</hi> so as to renew their Rheumatick Pains; others Died of <hi>Fevers, Consumptions, Convulsions, Bleeding,</hi> and <hi>Imposthumes.</hi>
                  </q> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of these I have seen in several in these Parts; but this Point Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> is pleased to touch as tenderly as an Hypothesis about the <hi>Waters,</hi> of which he seems afraid, but wou'd have us rest satisfy'd without asking Questions, and bring the Ingenuity of the most polite Parts, to an equal level with the most unthinking Animal: For my part I shall not fear to deliver my Sentiments, since I have no other end in it than to inform the World, in the Phaenomena I observ'd in Nature; and if these be exposing One's self to be thrown at like a <hi>Shrove-tide</hi> Cock, as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, if I escape the terrible Blow of being Neck'd, and survive the Combate, the Comb shall be at his Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>These Instances, as he proceeds, may convince all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering Persons, that we ought not to use hot Baths for Pleasure, especially where there is a fulness of Humours, and a hot Constitution; and since the following Accidents frequently happen upon Bathing, they will certainly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance all the Pleasure of it; the Inconveniencies he reckons are profuse Sweats and Haemorrhages, Apoplexies, Sleepiness, Vertigo's, Convulsions, Asthma's, debility of the Sight, Swooning, a general lassitude and dejection of the Appetite, Torpor of the Mind, and Effeminacy of the Flesh, pag. 4. My Journey to <hi>Buxton</hi> this last Year discover'd to me a Bath, very different to that at <hi>Bathe,</hi> it being a very temperate one, producing no Sweating after it, but rather a Coldness; and upon a due Consideration I found the Bath very useful in many Cases, in which that of <hi>Bathe</hi> did Injury, as in Comsumptions, hot Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick Pains, and all Defluxions of Humours, and Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61347:35"/>
and all hot inordinate Flatulencies of the animal Spirits, in Hysteric and Hypocondriac Cases.</q> The far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Particulars may be seen at large in his third Chapter, to which I refer you, as likewise to his Extract out of Dr. <hi>Iones,</hi> and the Observations annex'd to his ingenious Treatise.</p>
               <p>Before I close the Discourse of this <hi>Bath</hi> it may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, why the Sulphur in one Bath tinges Silver a Copper colour, as that at <hi>Knarseborough</hi> and <hi>Maudsley;</hi> why others of a Golden or Yellowish colour, as those in <hi>Somersetshire;</hi> and why others impregnated with Sulphur tinge not at all. To these I answer, Where Sulphur tinges a Copper colour, it is from the addition of a Vitriolic Salt, as is common to observe from the solutions of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Vitriol;</hi> but where a Golden colour ensues it is from a greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mineral Sulphur, and but little of Vitriol, as in the <hi>sulphur Auratum</hi> of Antimony, and the golden Pyrites: But where they Tinge not at all, its from Sulphur only, as that at <hi>Buxton,</hi> which seems to arise out of a Bassy Marble.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Waters</hi> we shall next consider are the <hi>Acidulae,</hi> or those commonly call'd <hi>Chalybeats,</hi> with which these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties abound. The most Notes are those near <hi>Lantham, Wigan, Stockport, Burnley, Bolton, Plumpton, Middleton, Strangeway</hi> near <hi>Manchester, Lancaster, Larbrick, Chor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and of these <hi>Stockport</hi> is much the strongest; these Waters spring out at the Bottom of a great Rock, in strength are much the same in Winter as Summer, which is a Conveniency very few in <hi>England</hi> besides them have; these Waters give as deep a Tincture with Galls, as any I ever saw, and where Chalybeats are indicated exceed those of <hi>Knarseborough</hi> and <hi>Tunbridge;</hi> they will in twenty-four Hours, by being expos'd to the Air become insipid, and then yield no Tincture; these Waters lie very light, not heavy upon the Stomach, which is a Convenience the Drinkers of <hi>Knarseborough</hi> and <hi>Tunbridge</hi> have not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61347:35"/>
These Waters are impregnated with <hi>Sulphur, Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Ocre,</hi> a little of the <hi>Lapis Scissilis,</hi> and a marine Salt united with the bitter purging Salt, as in the Chalybeat Water at <hi>Latham,</hi> but these Two last it yields in small quantities, a Gallon of Water not affording many Grains of Salt, but Ocre and Vitriol they contain plentifully; the Ocre is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with Iron, and for that reason, and no other, may these Waters be call'd <hi>Chalybeats:</hi> the Sulphur is only discernible early in the Morning, and that chiefly by their smell, tho' there is a Chalybeat near <hi>Manchester,</hi> whose smell is very Sulphureous at all times; these Waters most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly spring out of a <hi>Bass</hi> that is impregnated with <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, Ocre</hi> and <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which I demonstrated to the Hon<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Floyer</hi> at <hi>Buxton:</hi> I shew'd him the <hi>Shale</hi> or <hi>Bass,</hi> and by infusing various Proportions of it in common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you may have all the various Colours of the <hi>Acidulae, viz.</hi> A pale Red, a deep Red, a Violet and a Purple: As therefore the <hi>Acidulae</hi> are differently impregnated with this <hi>Bass,</hi> their Colours are likewise different. At the same time I shew'd him an <hi>Acidula</hi> springing out of this <hi>Bass,</hi> and likewise that the <hi>Bass</hi> was impregnated with <hi>Sulphur, Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Ocre,</hi> tho' Dr. <hi>Lister</hi> vehemently affirms, no Stone but the <hi>Pyrites</hi> contains <hi>Vitriol;</hi> but when a Man writes only what he fancies, and not what he sees, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagin'd but he must assert many Paradoxes; and by too tenaciously adhering to a well woven Hypothesis, in effect makes himself one of the meanest of Philosophers. It is not the mechanisme of Reason, and the espousing of a Word which sounds pleasantly, that illustrates the Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of Nature; but that which is plain, easy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, and what may rationally from Experiments be deduced, that gives a Man a true Gust in natural Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The Dr. then may rail as long as he pleases, but he can never make me disbelieve my Senses, or assent to that which is contrary to the common Reason of Mankind. Of these I have given a full Account in my <hi>Tentamen</hi> of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61347:36"/>
                  <hi>Mineral Waters,</hi> and my <hi>Exercitations,</hi> to those there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I refer my Reader; I shall only presume so far upon the Reader's Patience to annex the following Experiments, and shall not expatiate further on this Subject.</p>
               <p>The First is to shew, Why <hi>Galls, Oak-leaves,</hi> &amp;c. will give a Tincture with those <hi>Waters</hi> vulgarly <hi>Chalybeats,</hi> and why other Acids will not. The Second is to illustrate, How by mixing Acids with those Waters before you put the Galls to 'em, that then the <hi>Galls,</hi> &amp;c. will not. To clear these Phaenomena we must premise these Hypotheses, <hi>viz.</hi> That several of the mineral Particles are suspended in the fluid, perhaps as near to an Equilibrium or Balance as can easily be conceiv'd; so that the least addition of another Body to 'em, must instantly cause a Precipitation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently then give a Tincture to these Waters, by imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Pores, and so in different Angles transmitting the Light, which must needs introduce a Diversity of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, <hi>viz.</hi> A pale Red, Agat, Violet, Purple, or intense Red, according to the various Proportions of the Mineral impregnating the Water: Hence therefore it is, that the Galls containing a volatile Acid, or rather austere, that by their hooked Particles they easily clasp themselves about the mineral Particles, and must therefore (as is evident from the Premises laid down) necessarily cause a precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Mineral; which I shall more fully illustrate, by making it probable, that the mineral Particles are sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in the fluid in the manner recited. It is observable, that the Earth over which these Springs run is always co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with an <hi>Ocre;</hi> which to me seems evidently to hint, that the mineral to the fluid retains so equal a balance, that the least motion occasions a separation; and thence it is, that in those places where they have their currents, they constantly drop an <hi>Ocre,</hi> and colour the Earth as before observ'd.</p>
               <p>The second Experiment is this: If before you put in the Gall you add an Acid to the Water, as for example, Spirit
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61347:36"/>
of <hi>Vitriol</hi> or <hi>Sulphur,</hi> the Gall then gives little or no Tincture to the Water; and the Reason I take to be this, the Acid you mix with it being specifically heavier than either the mineral Particles or the fluid, by their rigid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible Particles keep the Mineral suspended; so that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the acid of the Gall being volatile, it is not power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough to bring 'em down, and thence it is that by this method they usually hover upon the surface of the Water in an azure Cloud, the Mineral as well as that being Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile; which is abundantly evident, both in the Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those Waters, and likewise by exposing them to the Sun, which in twenty-four Hours makes them insipid, and in that space of time so sequester'd of the mineral Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, that then they will not yield any Tincture with a Gall, or if any but a faint one: So volatile is the <hi>Vitriol</hi> in those Waters, which no doubt is carry'd off by the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> which from its Volatility might justly be drawn like the Statue of <hi>Mercury</hi> wing'd, and still pointing upwards.</p>
               <p>To these I thought necessary to add the following Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, that I might do Justice both to the publick, and to that most Learned and Ingenious Gentleman <hi>Richard Townley</hi> of <hi>Townley</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> who Communicated them to me.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Water</hi> at <hi>Burnley</hi> in <hi>Lancashire</hi> he has observ'd the following Phaenomena: <hi>First,</hi> That if that Water be expos'd to the Air there will subside a Scarlet sediment. This being a Phaenomenon never observed before in any Water in <hi>England</hi> I ever heard of, it may therefore justly challenge our Conjectures about it. <hi>Ocre</hi> and <hi>Lapis Scissilis,</hi> which are the usual Hypostases of those kind of Waters, it is most evident it cou'd not be; the one being of a Yellow, the other of a Greyish colour; but to me it seems to be a Bituminous exalted <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and this will more fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear when we come to examine its Salts, of which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Three different species: First, A small proportion of <hi>Natron,</hi> or <hi>Aegyptian Nitre,</hi> which if exposed to the Air will like that, or Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> dissolve <hi>per deliquium;</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:61347:37"/>
will ferment with any Acid, and has a strong lixivial Taste. After the <hi>Natron</hi> has run <hi>per deliquium</hi> there remains ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Salt entire, which if dissolv'd in Spirit of Wine or Water totally flies off; by which it is plain the Salt is vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and most probably the volatile Salt of the <hi>Natron,</hi> which is the only fix'd Alcali in the World I know of, that by this method, or by the fix'd Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> will yield a volatile Alcalisate Salt: From which Phaenomena it is undeniably evident Dr. <hi>Lister</hi> was mistaken, when (to use his own words) he violently affirms, No <hi>Waters</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> contain'd <hi>Natron;</hi> a Gallon of this Water contains about twelve Grains of Sediments, and four or five of Salts; the Salts when separated from their Earths are White, but will not shoot into any regular Chrystals; have a smell much like that of Natural Balsam, which to me seems to be the scarlet <hi>Sulphur</hi> that precipitates in the Water by exposing it to the Air; this Water has a vitriolate Taste, and with Galls yields a Tincture of an Agate colour; has been experimented in scorbutick Cases, and answered the desired end.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hanbridge</hi> Water, a small Spring which lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Burnley</hi> and <hi>Townley,</hi> yields a <hi>Natron</hi> or natural Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali, as those <hi>Bourbon</hi> Waters in <hi>France,</hi> cited by Monsieur <hi>Du-Closs;</hi> and another alcalious Salt, which like a Terebin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinate or Resinous Body, will melt with a small degree of Heat; it is plain, the Reason why this Salt melts by Heat is only from a volatile Bitumen united with it, for the Salt being long kept in a glass Vial, will not melt by any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate degree of Heat, but is then purely Alcalious, the Bitumen being wholly evaporated, as I found in my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations at <hi>Townley.</hi> This <hi>Water</hi> at the Fountain with Galls yields a Tincture inclining to a faint Orange; if kept any considerable time in Glass Bottles a perfect Citrine; contains the greatest quantity of <hi>Natron</hi> of any in these parts; purges by Stool and Urine, and is of great Use in the <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Scurvy,</hi> as hath been found by several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61347:37"/>
who in those Cases have try'd them with great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Water</hi> near <hi>Emmet,</hi> which is about two Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from those fore-mention'd <hi>Waters,</hi> is of a vitriolate Taste, and sulphureous Smell, which with a solution of Sublimate yields a white Precipitate, which no other <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> in those parts will do, nor any in <hi>France,</hi> as the French <hi>Virtuosi</hi> have observ'd, and indeed only those at <hi>Spada</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> and if so it may be highly worth our time by frequent and strict Tryals, both in Cases in <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,</hi> and Experiments in <hi>Chymistry,</hi> to find out the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Use of it, which may perhaps save us the Expences of a tedious Fatigue to <hi>Spada.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the same time I saw there a Salt prepared from a <hi>Water</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> which had exactly the smell of <hi>Hippose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linum</hi> or <hi>Horse-Parsley,</hi> a Phaenomenon never yet observ'd in any Salt before; this smell proceeds from a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of bituminous, saline and terrene Particles; for what remain'd after evaporation was of a Yellowish colour, and contain'd a great deal of terrene Matter, but the Salt when separated is perfect concocted <hi>Vitriol.</hi> Dr. <hi>Lister</hi> may here again be satisfy'd of his Error, for not only the <hi>Waters</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> but those likewise in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perfect concocted <hi>Vitriol:</hi> Nay, in the same <hi>Coal-Mines</hi> near <hi>Burnley,</hi> there are Springs of perfect <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and under these others that contain <hi>Natron</hi> or <hi>Aegyptian Nitre,</hi> as the above-mention'd ingenious Gentleman fully demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated to me when I was last there. Another <hi>Salt</hi> the said <hi>Richard Townley</hi> of <hi>Townley</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> shew'd me, which was perfect <hi>Salt-petre,</hi> prepared from a very rapid Spring, a Gallon of which contain'd half an Ounce of this Salt, which upon Chrystallization shoots like <hi>Salt-petre</hi> from <hi>India</hi> into long <hi>Striae,</hi> and fulminates with <hi>Sulphur.</hi> This Salt he had from a Gentleman that discover'd the Spring, but at present conceals the Place: So that what my self and others have alleged in affirming, no Waters in <hi>England</hi> to contain <hi>Salt-petre</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:61347:38"/>
is erroneous; let others retract when they think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, for my part I fairly own my Error, and from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Observations can positively affirm, there is no marine Salt but what contains more or less of <hi>Indian Nitre,</hi> but the proportion is so small, and the method of preparing it so tedious, it wou'd not be of any farther use than to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the curious Enquirer; but the Advantages that may accrue from the before recited Spring, may for ought I know be one of the greatest Treasures, as well as Secrets in Nature.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>Mineral-Waters</hi> I shall consider, are those springing out of <hi>Bass,</hi> and Sulphureous only; of these the most Noted is One near a Place call'd <hi>Inglewhite,</hi> this springs out of a Black <hi>Bass,</hi> which by Calcination I found to contain <hi>Sulphur;</hi> the Water has a very sulphureous Smell, as strong as that near <hi>Harrigate</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> but contains little or no Salt, which is the reason it is not Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative like that, but by adding the like proportion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt to it, <hi>viz.</hi> about a Dram to a Pint of Water, that Inconvenience is remedy'd, and then you have either sulphureous Baths, or purging Waters; for my part I shou'd rather choose to add the bitter purging Salt, as being most agreeable.</p>
               <p>Having now examin'd all the various <hi>Waters</hi> springing out of <hi>Bass,</hi> we proceed in the next place to give Account of saline sulphureous <hi>Waters</hi> arising out of other <hi>Minerals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I shall begin first with the <hi>sulphur Water</hi> near <hi>Wigan,</hi> call'd by the Inhabitants of that place, the <hi>Burning-Well;</hi> this is a very diverting Phaenomenon, and for its Rarity is visited by most Persons whose Curiosity leads them to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Enquiries. It is about two Miles from <hi>Wigan,</hi> in a Village call'd <hi>Aucliff,</hi> in the Ground of <hi>William Mollineux</hi> of that Place <abbr>Esq</abbr>. The <hi>Well</hi> is at the Bottom of a Tree, the <hi>Water</hi> Cold, and without any Smell; when any Person comes to see it, a Man clears the Well from all its Water, that done you will immediately hear a hissing Noise in a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61347:38"/>
Corner of it, and by holding a lighted Candle near to it, the sulphureous <hi>Halitus</hi> immediately takes Fire, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards spreads it self upon what Water has issued in, and 'tis only then, indeed, it ought to be call'd the <hi>Burning-Well:</hi> 'Tis observable, tho' this sulphureous <hi>Halitus</hi> continually mixes with Water, yet the Water continues Cold, nor will it tinge Silver; wherefore I imagine this <hi>Halitus</hi> is purely sulphureous, consisting only of Oily inflammable Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, without any mixture of Vitriol, or if any but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable, and 'tis reasonable to suppose this kind of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur to impregnate the Baths at <hi>Buxton.</hi> 'Tis plain from these and the <hi>sulphur Wells</hi> at <hi>Maudsley,</hi> and those at <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigate</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> which are all sulphureous, and yet all Cold <hi>Waters,</hi> that it is only by accident that sulphur Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters become hot, <hi>viz.</hi> by Collision of the sulphureous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, when in the Spiracles of the Earth they have not a free open passage, they beat and dash one upon another, and by that Collision grow hot, as we may observe in the rubbing of the <hi>Phosphorus,</hi> which immediately takes Fire; likewise in new Hay, and in Wheels taking Fire by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only: For to imagine the Heat of the Baths to proceed from Fermentation in the Waters, or from subterraneous Fires, is no wise consistent with Experience, which after all our Hypotheses must be the true Touchstone of our Reason.</p>
               <p>The foregoing Instances may convince the World, that sulphureous Particles grow hot without Ignition, and that there are sulphureous Particles in all hot Baths is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonstrated: But for a farther Illustration of this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis take this following Experiment, Let some Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone be set on Fire in a Glass Body, immediately upon its taking Flame stop the Mouth of the Glass and the Flame expires, yet by the sulphureous Fumes dashing upon each other the sides of the Glass wax warm; a certain signal this must needs be, that where sulphureous Particles are deny'd a passage, or where they force their way through

uneven Sinuosities, by beating upon and encountring one another, an Heat must be produced, as is apparent by the Sun-beams in Convex Glasses. And this is farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by the Learned Dr. <hi>Browne</hi> in his Treatise of the Mines in <hi>Hungary;</hi> in some Places of the same Mine it was extreamly Cold, in others so intensely Hot, that tho' his Cloaths were never so thin, the Heat would be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to him. The Miners work all Naked, and Eight Hours are as much as most can endure.</p>
               <p>The Heat in these <hi>Waters</hi> cannot arise from Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because no fermentation can be discover'd in them; nor by any Experiments, either in Distillation, Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or any other Method cou'd I ever observe such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of Matter in them, that one part wou'd ferment upon another, so as to cause any sensible Heat.</p>
               <p>From subterraneous Fires they cannot proceed, because in these parts such were never known; or were there any, cou'd not but discover themselves, since no Fires will burn without admission of Air, and there must likewise be Flues and Chasms whence they vent their Smoke and foeculent parts; but since none of these were ever disclos'd in these parts, it is not probable the Baths should grow hot by any such cause; and when the Heat of the Baths may be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently explain'd by the Collision of sulphureous Particles, what necessity is there we should have recourse to any such unwarrantable Hypothesis, as a Fermentation in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or to subterraneous Fires: Those two Notions are lately espoused by Dr. <hi>Guidot</hi> and Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> of <hi>Bathe,</hi> but I am apt to think those Gentlemen rather fancy than observe the Phaenomena of Nature: For I am very well satisfy'd, had they made strict Enquiries into those Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they wou'd never have troubled the World with such Chimerical Hypotheses. Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> indeed does not much trouble himself or the World with any Scrutiny into the Contents of the Baths, or the Causes of the Heat of them; but only gives you an Instance from <hi>Savoy,</hi> which is as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61347:39"/>
as that place to his Undertaking: And as for Dr. <hi>Guidot</hi> he is so Inconsistent with himself, that unless he have the Art of reconciling Contradictions, I am sure his <hi>Thermae Britannicae</hi> are not to be accounted for. I do not speak this as any wise arrogating a greater Genius to my self, or to lessen those worthy Persons, but only from the Phaenomena I have observ'd in Nature; and if they please to do the same, I despair not of their Pardons.</p>
               <p>Having now done with the <hi>sulphureous saline Waters,</hi> in the next place I shall proceed to treat of <hi>saline</hi> Ones only, as those at <hi>Northwich, Namptwich, Middlewich, Dunham</hi> in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> and <hi>Barton</hi> in <hi>Lancashire.</hi> Various have been the Notions concerning the Rise of these Springs, some imagining they proceeded from the Sea, others from sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous Rocks of Salt which have of late Years been discover'd, and first made Useful by my self, in refining that Rock to a White granulated Salt, which is now pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed in many places. These Springs sometimes break out in the Rock, but oftner either above or under it; some of them in a Quart of Water contain about seven or eight Ounces of <hi>Salt,</hi> whence its plain that <hi>quatenus Salt-springs</hi> they proceed not from the Sea, because a Quart of the best of that Water affords seldome above an Ounce and Half of <hi>Salt.</hi> Some of these Springs will tinge with Galls, but most refuse it; whence its plain Dr. <hi>Lister</hi> in his usual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is much mistaken, in forcing the <hi>Pyrites</hi> upon us. 'Tis true from the sulphureous Smell that may be observ'd in the Fermentation betwixt this <hi>Salt</hi> and Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> that there is a Sulphur contain'd in the Salt, but that no wise warrants a <hi>Pyrites,</hi> since that is an aggregate of different Principles, <hi>viz. Ocre</hi> and <hi>Vitriol,</hi> besides <hi>Sulphur;</hi> which Bodies by the Dr's own Confession <hi>Salt</hi> does not contain, which is the only true Notion he lays down about those <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and that he may assume as an Observation of his own.</p>
               <p>It is likewise observable, that the <hi>Salt</hi> made from the Brine-springs, and the Rock-salt dissolv'd in fresh Water,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61347:40"/>
that these Salts will shoot into different Figures; whence it is evident the Brine-springs proceed not from the Rocks of Salt that are discover'd, but from Rocks of Salt that lie deeper in the Bowels of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Besides in different Springs I have observ'd the Figures of the Salt to differ, as some in <hi>Middlewich,</hi> from those at <hi>Northwich,</hi> where by Chrystallization they shoot into quite contrary Figures; so that the <hi>Sal Mediterraneum,</hi> as the Dr. stiles it, is like to lose its Character: Nay, Rock-salt it self will never shoot into any regular Figure at all, whence it may be averr'd, these Salt-springs have not their Saltness from any subterraneous Rocks of Salt yet known; it follows therefore, if they are not saturated either from the Sea, or from subterraneous Rocks of Salt, we may then form another Hypothesis, and conclude them to arise from Aerial saline Particles impregnating a proper <hi>Bass,</hi> and so by various Solutions and Impregnations, keeping a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Circulation, and so constantly supplying us; and what chiefly gives umbrage to this, is the Renascence of marine Salt, which is so prodigiously made out by <hi>Untzerus,</hi> in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of those Mountains of Salt that supply <hi>Russia, Persia, Mesopotamia, Media,</hi> and those vast Countries; which as he affirms, every Year Vegetates, and the places whence the Salt was digg'd is the Year following as full of Salt as before. Phaenomena like to this may be observ'd in the <hi>Vitriol-stone</hi> near <hi>Hesse-Cassel,</hi> and in those <hi>Iron-Mines</hi> belonging to the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> as is related by <hi>Fallopius.</hi> Besides the marine Salt these Springs do likewise contain the <hi>Nitrum Calcarium:</hi> Its observable the Salt of some of these Springs will not easily precipitate, but a little Allum and fresh Butter will effect it, and then it makes a larger Grain and stronger Salt than any of the rest. In the Evaporation of these Salts there is likewise observ'd a white Sand, which is thrown to the Corners of the Pan; and this by frequent Evaporation and Filtrations I found to be the Particles of the <hi>Bass,</hi> out of which these Salt-springs arise.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:61347:40"/>
The most noted <hi>Purging-Waters</hi> in these parts are those in a Village call'd <hi>Rougham,</hi> adjacent to the remarkable Sands which are the great Road into <hi>Furnace</hi> nine Miles in breadth, and at each Spring-tide entirely cover'd with Water; these in calm Weather afford us very pleasant Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, but in tempestuous Seasons no less dismal, than we can suppose the wild Desarts of <hi>Arabia.</hi> From the bottom of an high Rock near these, the Water issues forth in a very plentiful Current; it is a little brackish, taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly it purges both by Urine and Stool, and no doubt, by a due preparation of the Body they become of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary use in the Scurvy, Worms, crude Digestions, and Distempers of that Nature; the Water by Evaporation at the last becomes lixivial, and is then extremely brackish; as the Water evaporates, there successively arise Films at first reddish, and afterwards of a grey Colour: these Films will ferment with any Acid, and contain a little of a natural alcalious Salt, which I take to be the <hi>Natron</hi> of the Ancients; the Salt which remains after Evaporation, seems to be a Marine, but by frequent Filtrations and Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stallizations, I found it likewise contain'd a bitter purging Salt, which is truly Dr. <hi>Lister</hi>'s <hi>Nitrum Calcarium,</hi> and is that purging Salt which impregnates <hi>Epsom, Dullech, Northall,</hi> and other purging Waters in <hi>England,</hi> as is hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above; besides the Salt there likewise remains a greyish Earth, which will ferment with any Acid. When the Water is evaporated to a lixivial Colour, if you then drop Spirit of <hi>Harts-horn</hi> into it, it immediately makes a <hi>Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulum,</hi> and precipitates; which Phaenomenon is only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable in those Waters that contain the <hi>Sal Catharticum Amarum,</hi> which demonstrates that Salt likewise to contain a natural Acid, and if in the like Water you drop any acid Spirit, as that of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Vitriol,</hi> you will then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a very sulphureous smell. From these it is plain these Waters contain three different sorts of Salts, as the <hi>Natron,</hi> the <hi>Marine,</hi> and the <hi>Sal Catharticum Amarum;</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:61347:41"/>
likewise two sorts of <hi>Lapis Scissilis,</hi> either of which will ferment with an Acid, and Sulphur too. From a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of such Principles as these, what Effects may not be hoped for, in Scrophulous and Leprous Persons, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Distempers of that nature? Nay, I have been assur'd by some of the Inhabitants there, that some Persons by drinking these Waters have been recover'd from periodical <hi>Epilepsies:</hi> but again, I say, the Body ought to be rightly prepar'd before the drinking of them, and that Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Persons ought not to meddle with them, at least very sparingly; some Persons by drinking of these have been freed from the Jaundice, others from Quartan Agues, and in the <hi>Pica Virginis,</hi> if the Patient be not emaciated, you may reckon it a specifick; by drinking of these, prodigious Worms, as the <hi>Cucurbitae,</hi> the <hi>Ascarides,</hi> and Bunches of Worms, have frequently been voided, and I do not think in that Distemper the like to these are to be had.</p>
               <p>There are other <hi>Purging-Waters</hi> which arise out of a Morass in a Village call'd <hi>Witherslack:</hi> these Waters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a marine and a bitter purging Salt, but are inferior to the former. There is another purging Water which springs out of the Sand, near a Place call'd <hi>Mine-End,</hi> which is the Mouth of the River <hi>Wire:</hi> This no doubt is the Sea-Water, which filters thro' the Sand, but by reason of the shortness of the Filtration, (the Spring lying so near the River) or the looseness of the Sand, the marine Water is not perfectly dulcify'd, but retains a pleasing Brackishness, not unlike that which is observable in the Milk of a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <hi>Cow,</hi> or one that has Conceiv'd; this Water purges a little, but is much inferior to either of the other. These Waters give no Tincture with Galls, tho' Dr. <hi>Lister</hi> violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirms all saline Springs will do it. These are the most noted <hi>Purging-Waters</hi> that I have seen in these Parts, I shall therefore in the next place proceed to those, which may be ranked amongst the <hi>Acidulae,</hi> but do likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Natron:</hi> and those are the Waters near <hi>Burnley</hi> and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61347:41"/>
                  <hi>Emmett,</hi> which were first discover'd to me by that most Learn'd and Accomplish'd Gentleman <hi>Richard Townley</hi> of <hi>Townley</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> The like to these Mons. <hi>du Clos</hi> affirms are in several places in <hi>France;</hi> for a full Account of which, I refer the Reader to that ingenious Author.</p>
               <p>From the Experiments made by the Royal Academy in <hi>Paris</hi> in the <hi>Bourbon-Waters,</hi> and the parallel Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons those in these Parts entertain us with, we may make a probable Conjecture of their Principles, and I think may safely affirm that in the Cases where those are proper, these as a most natural Succedaneum may be made use of, and will, I question not, answer what Intentions may be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the former. These Waters with Galls give a Citrine Tincture, and the Gall immediately precipitates in white perpendicular Lines: but you must note these Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were made in the Waters remote from the Fountains; I evaporated several Quarts of the Water, and towards the latter end found it to have a little of a lixivial Tast, after the surface was cover'd with a thin greyish Film; this Film consisted of saline, alcalious and terrene Particles, and would make a brisk Fermentation with any Acid; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Salts rise in perpendicular Lines upon the sides of the Retort. The like Phaenomenon I observ'd in eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating the Water that came from <hi>Nitria</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and the like may be observ'd in Evaporation of other alcalious Salts: After the Water was wholly evaporated there stuck to the sides of the Retort a greyish Matter of a very lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial tast, and would ferment with any Acid. By Filtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Earth is easily separated from the Salt, and then you have a natural alcalious Salt the true <hi>Natron</hi> of the Ancients, as is manifest from those Specimens of <hi>Egyptian Nitre,</hi> brought from <hi>Nitria</hi> to the <hi>Musaeum</hi> at <hi>Oxford</hi> by the Learned Dr. <hi>H.</hi> and likewise by the Description of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron</hi> recited by <hi>Dioscordes;</hi> tho' our Countryman Dr. <hi>Lister</hi> boldly affirms there is no such Salt in any Waters in <hi>England:</hi> but this is not the first piece of Boldness he is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61347:42"/>
pleas'd to arrogate; and if his Reason be not totally screen'd, he may, if he pleases, be satisfy'd he's mistaken. These Waters are of great use in the Stone, Scurvy, and other Chronical Diseases, of which I have seen several Instances. There are other Waters of an austere styptick Tast, that will coagulate Milk, but give no Tincture with Galls, as some Pumps near <hi>Bury</hi> and <hi>Chorley;</hi> these I conjecture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise out of Allum Ore, or Marle; they lather not with Sope, but make a perfect <hi>Coagulum</hi> from the Acid and the Alcaly fixing together. Some Springs we have that petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, as one in a Wood near <hi>Bury,</hi> and another by the side of a Rivulet near <hi>Manchester;</hi> these Waters superficially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crustate as the Chymists call it, <hi>stratum super stratum;</hi> are of an austere Tast like those in <hi>Yorkshire;</hi> in Evaporation they yield a great quantity of a greyish Earth that will ferment with an Acid, and some little proportion of Salt. By these Phaenomena I do conjecture the terrene Particles are dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>Minimis.</hi> by the natural Acid, or (as <hi>Helmont</hi> calls it) the <hi>Esurine Spirit,</hi> and when on the surface of any Body they are united they form these Incrustations: I am the farther confirm'd in this Hypothesis, because I have observ'd Petrefactions where only there could be an Acid <hi>halitus,</hi> as in several Plants and Roots adjacent to the petrefying Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters near <hi>Knarseborough.</hi> These Waters inwardly taken are commended by several in Dysenteries, and for the same reason they are proper in those Cases; I do judge them of use in the Cure of a Diabetes. These are the most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Phaenomena I could ever observe of the <hi>Waters</hi> in these Parts: having therefore examin'd those, I shall, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my propos'd Method, in the next place proceed to give an Account of the various <hi>Earths</hi> these Counties afford us.</p>

                     </gap>se I shall examine in their Order, and shall in the first place take notice of his Observations concerning the Rise of <hi>Chalybeat Waters:</hi> Pag. 14. he says, the Earth and Soil of these Springs is ever a Sand or Gravel, and that the Water issues from, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes a Rock cemented of Stones, which are never to be found but where the Water is Vitriolic. How true this is, the World may judge from the following Observations: In the Rocks at <hi>Strangeway</hi> near <hi>Manchester</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> three or four Yards in Free-stone Rock, are several Chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat Springs, which with Powder of <hi>Galls</hi> give a deep Claret Tincture, and will answer all other Experiments usually try'd upon the <hi>Acidulae.</hi> Eight or nine Yards within a Free-stone Rock near <hi>Stockport,</hi> in the same County, are several <hi>Chalybeat Springs,</hi> which with Galls yield a purple, fully as deep as <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> or <hi>Knarseborough,</hi> and will turn green with Syrup of <hi>Violets;</hi> in these Rocks are found sometimes small Vitriol-stones, a small quantity of which scrap'd into common Water, instantly makes the artificial <hi>Chalybeat Waters,</hi> but there is not the minutest Particle of the <hi>Pyrites</hi> to be found here. It is plain hence, that these Springs proceed, not always, from Sand and Gravel, nor are they (as he alledges) <hi>Marcasitical,</hi> that is, Springs impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the <hi>Pyrites;</hi> for to satisfy his Curiosity farther, the <hi>Pyrites</hi> here is neither discoverable by Ocular Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, nor by dissolving the Rock in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> which he asserts, if it contains the <hi>Pyrites,</hi> will turn to a Gelly;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61347:43"/>
and yet that very Assertion is without ground, for because the <hi>Pyrites</hi> will turn to a Gelly, does it thence follow all Bodies that will do so, participate of the <hi>Pyrites?</hi> By the same reason he may aver, That because Bones and <hi>Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns</hi> with a little common Water, in Mons. <hi>Papin</hi>'s Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting Instrument, become gelatinous, that either the Bones contain the Horns, or <hi>vice versa,</hi> the Horns the Bones. Now since these Rocks answer not this end, it is evident these Springs, according to his own Notions, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from the <hi>Pyrit<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>;</hi> but this, I presume, he only assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Compliment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to an eminent Physician, and if he prefers his Friendship before strict and true Observations in Nature, I envy not his Choice. His other Experiments upon the <hi>Acidulae</hi> are no more than what have been before observ'd by other Authors, I shall therefore pass them over.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Purging-Waters,</hi> he derives them from the <hi>Pyrites, Selenites,</hi> and <hi>Loame,</hi> and are (as he alledges) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with purging Salts of various kinds, form'd into a saline Nature, by an acid Mineral Juice in the <hi>Loame.</hi> Hence, <hi>pag.</hi> 117. he has this Period: <q>So I conclude the Salt of these purging Waters to be of a middle Nature, betwixt <hi>Nitres</hi> and <hi>Vitriols,</hi> and form'd out of the <hi>Loame</hi> by the help of a Vitriolic Juice, or liquid Salt, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in most Cavities.</q> As to this Hypothesis, from the following Phaenomena, I doubt not but to convince him that he is again mistaken; that is, that there are Springs which do contain the bitter purging Salt, and yet arise not out of <hi>Loame, (e. g.)</hi> At <hi>Rougham</hi> in <hi>Furness</hi> in the County of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> at the bottom of a Rock issues a purging Spring, at least twenty Yards perpendicular from its Summit, where there is neither the <hi>Pyrites,</hi> the <hi>Belemnites,</hi> nor <hi>Loame:</hi> the Spring flows in a luxuriant Current. This Water, upon the first Evaporation, affords a Salt not much unlike Sea-Salt, but the marine may be easily separated from the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or purging Salt; and then you have a Salt which affords <hi>Bacilli,</hi> or <hi>Stiriae,</hi> which will easily dissolve even by the heat
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61347:43"/>
of the Hand, nay even by the Air it self, and answers all the Experiments Dr. <hi>Grew</hi> made upon <hi>Epsome-</hi>Salt: It is hence evident that these Salts have not their Origin (as he alledges) from the <hi>Pyrites, Selenites,</hi> and <hi>Loame;</hi> the Earth after distillation was light and of a greyish Colour, and would strongly ferment with an Acid. But to give him an ampler demonstration of his Error, I shall produce him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Instance or two: At <hi>Thernham</hi> in the County of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> there is an Earth which contains <hi>Loame,</hi> and a great quantity of <hi>Selenites;</hi> and the same Phaenomena may be observ'd upon the Ridge of Hills that run upon the Sea-Coasts towards <hi>Rossall,</hi> in the same County: out of both these Earths issue several Springs, which will neither tinge with Galls, nor are they Purgative; hence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, tho' the Principles he lays down do all concur, yet that thence does not necessarily follow a <hi>Marcasitical,</hi> or <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Water,</hi> nor are the Salts, as was observ'd before, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected so superficially as he alledges; 'tis true indeed I have seen the Salt Bass, by being expos'd to the Air, shoot out various Efflorescences, at the same time from a Spring is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing out of the same Bass, at least 20 Yards within the Earth, may be prepar'd the true bitter purging Salt: So that what he has inform'd us in relation to the <hi>Purging Waters,</hi> is as groundless as the former. As to his Method of preparing a Salt from <hi>Loame,</hi> by Spirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> it is no wise convincing, since the Phaenomena he recites may happen barely from the Spirit, without a Salt congenite to the <hi>Loame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> the different Salts he prepared from the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Waters,</hi> may, for ought I know, be true and exact; but what I alledge is, that neither the <hi>Chalybeats</hi> are always from the <hi>Pyrites,</hi> nor the <hi>Purging Waters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> from <hi>Loame, Marcasite,</hi> and the <hi>Selenites.</hi> His other Experiments are but what were before observ'd by Dr. <hi>Plot,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>du Clos,</hi> to whom I refer the Reader.</p>
                  <p>I shall in the next place examine his Observation upon the Bath in <hi>Somersetshire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> P. 178. he says, that <q>The Salt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61347:44"/>
in this Water appear'd fully to be <hi>Salt-petre,</hi> in that it did not disturb a solution of <hi>Sal Saturni</hi> in fair Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q> But this is no Demonstration at all of <hi>Salt-petre,</hi> for the bitter purging Salt will do the same, which is not at all Nitrous, altho' it bears the same <hi>Bacilli</hi> or <hi>Stiriae</hi> with <hi>Nitre;</hi> for since the Salt is not inflammable, there is no reason to suppose the Existence of <hi>Salt-petre.</hi> It now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears his Attempts upon <hi>Bath-Waters</hi> are as fruitless as his other Experiments, and in his reasoning about them he is inconsistent with himself: I shall only remark one thing more, that when this Purging Salt becomes stiriated, if it be dissolv'd in a small quantity of Water, in a few Days it drops an hard pellucid Salt, which will not dissolve in the Air; is bitter and pungent, the Figures of it are various, sometimes Cubical, sometimes Pentagons, and Parallelope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedons; so that it is manifest it is very difficult to reduce Salts to their distinct species, by determinate Figures. It is certain by these Experiments, that the Salt in this <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Water,</hi> which at first by its Tast and Figure seem'd only to be a common marine Salt, consists of three different Kinds; why therefore it should be stiled a <hi>Nitre,</hi> I can see no reason. I have often wondred why some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons ambitiously affect the Imposing of Terms, assuming to themselves Titles of New Discoverers, without any ground at all: For if from the mere Trunk of a <hi>Mole,</hi> I should go about to prove it was the species of an <hi>Elephant,</hi> the World would doubtless conclude me the blinder Creature.</p>
                  <p>I shall beg leave to add to this <hi>Appendix</hi> one thing more relating to Cold Springs; in which, as the <hi>Moralists</hi> assure us of the two contrary Passions, <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is an Expansion, the other a Depressure of the Spirits; so it is no less probable in these two opposite Qualities, Heat and Cold, that in one the Nerves are dilated, in the other shri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd or contracted: But since the Cause of intense Coldness is the Subject of this Paragraph, I shall only expatiate on the latter; in order to that I shall lay down a general Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61347:44"/>
and afterwards illustrate it, first by the Effects of Cold, and afterwards by parallel Experiments that produce it. Coldness therefore in Waters I suppose to proceed from volatile saline Particles, which by their Points contracting the Extremities of the Nerves, obstruct the Spirits, and thence proceeds an Horrour or Trembling; and if the Cold be intense, a Stupor, or Numbness, hence it is that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillaries in the Skin, by the Punctures of those saline Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles corrugate, and the Blood thereby stagnates, and by the distention of those Vessels the Skin appears extremely red. That Coldness in <hi>Waters</hi> proceeds from these saline Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, is evident from solutions of Snow in common Water, in which those Particles are so volatile, that upon Distilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I found them wholly to evaporate: It is not therefore as the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> imagine, that Coldness proceeds from dull unactive Principles, but from volatile saline ones, which by their Inflexibility or Rigidness, like so many Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, fix the Particles in Water, which are of a softer Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and thence it is that it freezes, and is turn'd into Ice: In Springs therefore that are naturally intensely Cold, I suppose the <hi>Loam,</hi> from whence these arise, to have Pores so configurated, as constantly to imbibe these saline Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles from the circumambient Atmosphere, which doubtless are of as Volatile nature as those of Snow; for I never could find in the Distillation of Cold Baths any Salt that could be reduc'd to a Chrystal, except a marine one, and that in so small a proportion, that it is impossible to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that the Coldness should proceed from thence. 'Tis true indeed in artificial Cold Baths the Water is made vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently so by solutions of marine Salt, and <hi>Salt-petre,</hi> but then to effect that, there are those quantities of Salts, that are never to be found in Baths naturally Cold; whence it is evident the Coldness in them cannot proceed from a solution of those Salts, but from a Volatile Aerial <hi>Nitre</hi> doubtless brought into the Atmosphere by particular Winds; for it is evident in opposite Parallels from the Line, in the one
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61347:45"/>
you have violent Frosts, in the other intense Heats, as the Ingenious Dr. <hi>Munday</hi> of <hi>All-Souls</hi> College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond contradiction has made evident.</p>
                  <p>The most remarkable Cold Spring in these Parts is that at <hi>Larbrick,</hi> of which take the following Account. Upon immersing your Hand into it, the Part immediately grows extreamly red, and you will then perceive a most violent Pain; Fishes of several sorts I have seen put into this Spring, which make but one Effort, and instantly expire. It is an <hi>Acidula,</hi> or <hi>Chalybeat Water,</hi> and therefore is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for in another place; as likewise the Effects of Cold Baths, which are consider'd in the following Treatise of the <hi>Scurvy</hi> and <hi>Rickets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But more fully to illustrate the unaccountable Penetrancy, Agility and Rigidness of those Particles that produce Cold, take the following Experiment: Let a <hi>Thermometer</hi> of a Foot long, and Hermetically seal'd at both ends, and about half fill'd with Spirit of Wine, be immers'd in a Cold Spring, for Instance in that at <hi>Larbrick,</hi> and continue suspended in it about half an Hour; in that space of Time the Spirit in the <hi>Tube</hi> will subside a full Inch, which Instance fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates how penetrating those frigorific Particles must be, that thus enter the Pores of the Glass, and force the Spirit to subside to that degree: This Instance likewise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates their Inflexibility, that by penetrating the Pores of the Glass, they should so fix their Points upon the superficies of the Vinous Spirit, which being of a softer Texture must necessarily give way and subside. By this Experiment you may easily find out the various Degrees of Cold in Springs, and by comparing those with Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the like nature, made in the two noted Baths, <hi>Holywell</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> and St. <hi>Mungus</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> may easily find of what use the Springs in these Counties may be in the like Cases which these are eminent for. I must needs own that in Leprous Distempers, Scorbutic Rheumatisms, the Rickets, and Scorbutic Atrophies, before the Hectic heat
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61347:45"/>
is grown too intense, I have not seen any Medicines per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Effects which these <hi>Waters</hi> frequently do.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Earths, Clays, Boles, Marles, Improvements by Shells, Shell-Fishes, Hares and Rabbit-Skins, Sope-Boylers Ashes, and Putrify'd Ferns; of Morasses, and their various Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THese Countries afford us various sorts of <hi>Earths,</hi> but the most noted are the <hi>Black Soil,</hi> the <hi>Foxglove-Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Clay-Earth,</hi> which indeed is a mixture of Clay and Marle. The <hi>Black Earth</hi> is commonly rich Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, or Meadowing, or good Corn-Land; the <hi>Foxglove-Earth,</hi> which is a tender Earth, and of a brownish Colour, is usually good Pasture, and by Improvement brings plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Harvests of Corn; the <hi>Clay-Earth</hi> is chiefly for Corn, and in that either for continuing long, or producing a well fed Corn, exceeds both the other. Sometimes these Earths abound with great quantities of Lime-stones and other Stones, which mightily contribute to their plentiful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, as is observable in the Closes near <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and other parts in the North; the Country People imagine it proceeds from the Warmth they impart to the various <hi>Earths,</hi> but I rather attribute it to their Nitrous or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calious <hi>Salts,</hi> which, as I shall demonstrate hereafter, conduce to the fructifying of <hi>Earths.</hi> These <hi>Earths</hi> are usually improv'd either by Marle, Dung, Lime, Shell-Fishes, Shells, Rags, Hares, or Rabbit-skins, Sope-maker's Ashes, Sea-Mud, the common Dirt of the Lanes, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trify'd Ferns. The <hi>Marles,</hi> where there is depth of Soil are usually the best Improvements; and indeed a good Marling is often counted equal to the Purchase of the Land; the Marle affords a Nitrous <hi>Salt,</hi> and <hi>Oyl,</hi> which I take to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61347:46"/>
be the Principles that make it so fertile; its <hi>Salt</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture is imbib'd from the Air, which may be the reason that the longer it lies expos'd, the more prolific it is: Hence it is common amongst Persons that can afford, to Marle their Ground, and break it up several Years afterwards, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more fruitful, and continues much longer. The white <hi>Marle</hi> is of a brittle, short Body, and consequently more easily wash'd away by the Weather; for this reason it only renders the Soil fruitful for a few Years, not comparable to the other for continuance. The like may be said of <hi>Lime,</hi> and putrify'd <hi>Marine-Fishes,</hi> and <hi>Shells,</hi> which by their Calcination by the Sun-beams are converted into Lime, these being of a looser Body than the Clay-Marle, more speedily mix with the <hi>Earths,</hi> and for that reason, as the Country People term it, will sooner <hi>white,</hi> that is, will sooner produce Corn; the same may be said of Sea-mud, however the Continuance of these are far inferior to the other: The Fruitfulness of the last mention'd I judge may proceed in a great measure from their Oyls and alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Salts, with a due proportion of Earth, and no doubt but Acid and Alcaly have the same use in fructifying Soils, as they have in Animals; and hence I believe that from the Dung of the Sea-Fowl in <hi>Fowley-Island,</hi> which takes that Name from the abundance of Sea-Fowl there, the Pasture becomes so pregnant, that it surpasses all in these Parts; a <hi>Sheep</hi> from thence is usually sold for 50 <hi>s.</hi> or 3 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The most noted <hi>Clays</hi> in these Parts are the <hi>Potters-Clay, Tobacco-pipe-Clay,</hi> and <hi>Sope-stone,</hi> as the Miners call it. The <hi>Potters-Clay</hi> is usually blew or yellowish, or of a <hi>Dove</hi> or <hi>Coushat-</hi>Colour, as the Workmen term it; after it is moulded into Pots, it is burned in a circular Oven, and is glazed with a <hi>Slurry,</hi> and <hi>Lead-Ore</hi> finely powder'd: This <hi>Slurry</hi> is made of a different Clay to what the Pot is; it is usually reddish, and will run to a Glass, which the others will not; which is the reason that with this and <hi>Lead-Ore</hi> they glaze their Pots. It is observable this <hi>Slurry</hi> upon
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61347:46"/>
one sort of Clay will be yellow, upon another black, on another green, and on others of the Colour of the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>'s Bottles, which must proceed from various Metals that flux from the Clays, and consequently produce va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Colours.</p>
               <p>I was inform'd from my Ever-honour'd Friend Sr. <hi>Roger Bradshaw</hi> of <hi>Haigh,</hi> that it was upon a whitish yellowish Earth, in a Field near the <hi>Kennel-Pits</hi> at <hi>Haigh,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Dwight</hi> made his first Discovery of his most incomparable Metal: I have attempted several Colours with <hi>Smalts,</hi> and found that by those, and an azurine Spar frequently found in Lead and Copper Mines, I could upon <hi>Barnstable-Clay</hi> run a Glass not easily distinguishable from <hi>Tortoise,</hi> and no doubt if experimented by an Artist, he would find it of extraordinary use. I have likewise with several of these Earths run black Lead, by which and a little <hi>Horse-</hi>Dung finely powder'd and then wrought together, I have seen it stand Fire, when a good <hi>German</hi> Crucible has broke in pieces. Instruments of this may doubtless be made of great use to the Essayers and Refiners of Metals, and be had at far more easy Rates than those brought from <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> Tiles of any sorts are likewise made from these Earths.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tobacco-pipe-Clay</hi> is usually blew, or of a Colour betwixt white and yellow; there are at <hi>Rainforth</hi> tolerable Pipes made of this, but not comparable to those at <hi>Chester,</hi> these are made of Clays brought from the <hi>Isle of Wight, Poole</hi> and <hi>Biddiford,</hi> which are esteem'd the best in <hi>England,</hi> and if I mistake not the best in <hi>Europe. Boles</hi> we have only in two places, <hi>Eller</hi> and <hi>Heesham;</hi> these are of a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Colour, stick close to the Tongue, and will ferment with an Acid. In the same place we have likewise a white Earth, or <hi>Sope-stone;</hi> this will lather with Water, I have seen some Persons trimm'd with it; this is usually full of the <hi>Pyrites,</hi> when wet very Oily, but when dry put into Water will make an hissing like unquenchable Lime:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61347:47"/>
Upon which Phaenomenon I shall beg your patience, to expatiate a little before I proceed to the next particular. Mons. <hi>L'Emery</hi> has observ'd, That the reason of the Ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unquenchable <hi>Lime</hi> with Water, proceeds from the setting at liberty the igneous Particles lock'd up in the <hi>Lime,</hi> hence they disentangle themselves, and rallying with united Forces, must consequently produce that Ebullition. The like I think may be affirm'd of this, only here the Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition causes not any sensible Heat, which notwithstanding may be, tho' igneous Particles be contain'd in the Water, as I have seen in the <hi>Burning-Well</hi> near <hi>Wigan,</hi> which is actually Cold. But that this Ebullition does proceed from sulphureous Particles, I have reason to conjecture, because out of these <hi>Earths,</hi> thro' the salt Water, frequent flashes of Flame may be observ'd like Lightning to dart by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals; it appears a diverting <hi>Phosphorus</hi> in the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>season, at which time spreading the said Earth upon my Hand, I have discern'd the like Phaenomenon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Morasses</hi> we have several in these parts, which may be distinguish'd into these Classes, the White, the Grey, the Black: It is plain from Microscopical Observations, that the White is nothing but a Compages of the Leaves, Seeds, Flowers, Stalks and Roots of Herbs, and Fruits or Shrubs which no doubt increase every Year; these burn to white Ashes, but yield but little of lixivial Salt. The Grey is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and more ponderous, and to me seems to be but a more perfect putrefaction of the former. The Black is the best Fire, and the most Bituminous, which I take to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated putrefaction of the Plants that grow upon these places, as <hi>Elaeagnus, Ros Solis, Erica,</hi> and the like; and in this I am farther confirm'd, because I have frequently observ'd the white <hi>Moss,</hi> which is demonstrably a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages of the recited Plants, converted easily to black <hi>Moss,</hi> which is done by draining of the Dales, or cutting Sluces thorow the <hi>Morasses;</hi> by which means the white <hi>Moss</hi> which before was like a Spunge saturated with Water, now
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61347:47"/>
drain'd, contracts to a more compact Body. Besides these are the <hi>Heath-Turffs,</hi> and a bituminous Earth near <hi>Orms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi> but of that I shall discourse in its proper place. 'Tis the receiv'd Opinion, that these <hi>Morasses</hi> had their Rise from <hi>Noah</hi>'s Deluge, and this Hypothesis seems to be back'd by the great quantities of exotic Trees, marine Shells, and other Phaenomena that are observ'd there; I have likewise seen a Brass-Kettle which was given me by Major <hi>George Westby,</hi> and a small Mill-stone found in those places, as likewise Beads of Amber. 'Tis plain these could not be brought thither by <hi>Noah</hi>'s Deluge, since in those early days the Refining of Metals was not known, and 'tis very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable such kind of Mill-stones not made use of: But since I have shown how <hi>Moss</hi> may, and doubtless does increase, it is easy to conceive how such things may sometimes be found in <hi>Morasses;</hi> but whether these subterraneous Trees, <hi>Pine-Cones, Nuts</hi> and <hi>Shells</hi> did grow in these places, or were brought thither by the universal Flood, is a Question that may challenge our next Consideration. I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I have not seen <hi>Firrs</hi> grow naturally in any part of this Kingdom, but what there are have been rais'd by great Care and Industry; and <hi>Caesar</hi> assures us, that when he first invaded this Island there did not any <hi>Firrs</hi> grow in it. From these to me it seems plain, that these could not come from any other Cause but a Deluge, and it is most probable from that dreadful one recited by <hi>Moses:</hi> Some persons I know have endeavour'd to evade this Assertion by averring, that these subterraneous Trees were not really <hi>Firrs,</hi> but only Woods made Resinous by a bituminous Earth, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently might be there without a Deluge. To these I answer; Not only <hi>Firr-stocks,</hi> but <hi>Firr-Apples</hi> are likewise found in these <hi>Morasses,</hi> and these I hope those Gentlemen will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me could not belong to any other Tree but to the <hi>Firr;</hi> besides the grain of the Wood, and the <hi>Turpentine</hi> that upon burning drops from it, sufficiently demonstrate it to be really <hi>Firr:</hi> so that what is argued upon that account
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61347:48"/>
is but a meer Subterfuge, and bears nothing of Argument along with it. I have often indeed wondred how upon the tops of Mountains there are sometimes these <hi>Morasses,</hi> and the adjacent Valleys Arable Ground; but in that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Confusion which doubtless was at the Deluge, I think the Phaenomena of Nature cannot be mechanically account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for: so that if a Naturalist can but demonstrate a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge by <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> that it only could produce these wonderful Effects; whether he can or not assign the <hi>Modus</hi> of doing it, is not material. These <hi>Firrs</hi> are split and dried, and by the poorer People made use of instead of Candles.</p>
               <p>It is urged by the Learn'd Dr. <hi>Plot,</hi> that these <hi>Morasses</hi> were the products of the Woods that grew upon them, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> by putrefaction of the Leaves, Rains and Dews, may, as we daily see, be converted into <hi>Boggs</hi> or <hi>Morasses;</hi> and that the <hi>Firrs</hi> found there were not brought thither by any Deluge, but were the product of the Soil, and in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ruin'd by the <hi>Britains,</hi> in revenge to the <hi>Danes,</hi> the <hi>Pines</hi> being their darling Tree; and he adds that <hi>Caesar</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never seen the Northern Parts where the <hi>Pines</hi> grew, might easily be mistaken in that as well as in the <hi>Beech-</hi>Tree, which he asserts was not in this Island, tho' found contrary by Experience. To these I answer, Tho' the Hypothesis be ingenious, yet for the following reasons I think it not to be defended: For in the first place I think it not rational to conjecture, that the <hi>Pine</hi> thro' the whole Island could be so universally destroy'd, as that for the future it should never be the natural product of the Soil, as we find at this day it is not; besides had the <hi>Pine,</hi> as he asserts, been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd in revenge to the <hi>Danes,</hi> by the <hi>Britains,</hi> they would for the same reason have destroy'd the <hi>Oak</hi> too, the <hi>Danes</hi> at that time being an Heathenish People, and their <hi>Druids</hi> Worship'd that Tree, for which therefore they must doubtless have a far greater Veneration than for the <hi>Pine.</hi> Wherefore had the <hi>Pines</hi> been destroy'd for this
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61347:48"/>
reason only, the <hi>Oak</hi> likewise could not but have falln a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to their fury; for surely their own Superstition in that revengeful Juncture could never have been a Curb to their unbounded Rage. Secondly, The Postures the <hi>Firr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocks</hi> are found in, evince they were brought thither by a Deluge; I have seen seven or eight of a vast Thickness contiguous to each other, and whoever considers the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of them must necessarily conclude they could never grow there in that Order, it being impossible there should be a distance betwixt each Tree for the ascending Boughs. Thirdly, Under these are frequently found the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of Animals, as Shells, Bones of Fishes, under one particularly I saw the Head of the <hi>Hippopotamus;</hi> it is plain from hence these could not come from any other Cause but a Deluge; and if so, since the <hi>Pine</hi> is not the product of this Island, we may as reasonably suppose those to be brought thither after the same manner. What <hi>Caesar</hi> alledges of the <hi>Beech</hi> not growing here, I am apt to think that kind of <hi>Beech</hi> he saw in <hi>Italy</hi> never grew wild in this Country; we may conjecture this from the description <hi>Virgil</hi> gives of the <hi>Beech-</hi>Tree, when he terms it <hi>Patula Fagus,</hi> which cannot be affirm'd of those produced usually in <hi>England:</hi> And this may serve for an Answer to what is espous'd by Dr. <hi>Plot.</hi> I shall therefore in the next place proceed to consider the bituminous Earth near <hi>Ormskirk,</hi> that being another species of <hi>Moss;</hi> but before we close this Paragraph I shall presume so far upon your Patience, as to give a solution to an Objection urg'd by some, and then conclude. It is observ'd by some the <hi>Pines</hi> by themselves are found in Numbers, and likewise other Trees rang'd in order are discover'd together, as <hi>Birch, Ashe</hi> and <hi>Oak,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd in several Lines, whence they probably infer that Woods of those distinct Trees once grew there. To this I answer, That tho' they may be observ'd so in <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin-Meer,</hi> yet the Assertion is not generally true, for I have observ'd them in other places to lie promiscuously;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61347:49"/>
here a <hi>Firr-stock,</hi> next to it a <hi>Birch,</hi> an <hi>Oak,</hi> or an <hi>Ashe,</hi> not keeping any Order at all; so that what one particular place may do, no wise illustrates a general History of those fossile Trees, since generally speaking the quite contrary is observ'd. Secondly, These Ranks of Trees found together no wise invalidates the Deluge, for the same Argument may be urg'd against fossile Shells, which are frequently found collected there; yet I suppose no Man will urge this as an Argument of their not being brought thither by a Deluge, but rather the contrary, since upon the Sea-shore in their native Beds they are always found in great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p>To these may be added that remarkable Mountain call'd <hi>Naphat</hi> in the Province of <hi>Conought</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which is several hundred Fathom above the surface of the Sea, yet at the top of this Mountain ten Yards within it are vast Beds of all sorts of marine Shells, as <hi>Whelks, Muscles, Cockles, Perewinkles, Torculars, Pecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, Turbinites, Oysters,</hi> &amp;c. which doubtless, considering the immense height of the Mountain, could not be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited there by any means but a Deluge, and that an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal one. Parallel to these are those vast Mountains of Oyster-shells in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and other parts of the <hi>West-Indies;</hi> likewise the vast quantities of marine Shells found several Yards deep in firm Marle in Lands remote from the Sea, in which five Yards within the Marle I saw the Skeleton of a <hi>Buck</hi> standing upon his Feet, and his Horns on its Head, which are yet preserv'd at <hi>Ellel-Grange</hi> near <hi>Lancaster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I'll give you one Instance more, That eight Yards within Marle in <hi>Larbrick</hi> near <hi>Preston</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> was found the entire Head of a <hi>Stag,</hi> with the Vertebrae of the Neck whole, which by its Branches and Magnitude is forein to any I ever observ'd in these parts; but by the Cuts of those in <hi>Canada,</hi> I cannot judge them any other than of those in that Country: These are now in the Custody of <hi>Richard Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> of St. <hi>Michaels</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> when they were taken out of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61347:49"/>
the Earth they were soft and pliable, but now hard and firm. A Phaenomenon not unlike to this is observable in <hi>Coral,</hi> which immediately grows hard, the humid Particles being spent by the heat of the Air; so that the saline and terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial Particles are not longer disunited, but thence come to a strict union, and consequently an hard and firm Body. More Instances of this nature might be produc'd, but what are recited are sufficient to confirm an impartial Reader in the truth of what is alledg'd; and to others I think it not worth while to make any Address at all.</p>
               <p>However I shall produce another Instance, and then leave every one to his particular Sentiments: In a Place in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cashire</hi> call'd the <hi>Meales,</hi> under the Moss four Yards with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Marle was found an exotic Head, which by the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given me of it by the Country People, may doubtless be that of an <hi>Elke;</hi> the Brow-Antlers were bigger than u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually the Arm of a Man is, the Beams were near 2 Yards in height, and betwixt the two opposite Tips of the Horns, which is the Diameter, was 2 Yards likewise. Such a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity never before seen in these Parts induc'd the Country People to cut it asunder into many pieces, each preserving a part as a Rarity; so that had it been entire, it had been much greater: The scatter'd remains of it may now be seen in different Places, but that is but a slender satisfaction to a curious Enquirer. The <hi>Elke</hi> most certainly is and ever was a Creature forein to this Nation, how therefore so many Yards in Marle under the Moss this should come to be deposited, by any other means than an universal Deluge, I would gladly be inform'd; considering likewise the wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Place, and the thin number of People where this Phaenomenon was observ'd, (for the <hi>Meales</hi> are little more cultivated than the Desarts of <hi>Arabia)</hi> I think I may venture to affirm, if a Man will lay aside Prejudice, and not be too fond of an over-weening Opinion, he cannot account for it any other way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:61347:50"/>
To close this Head it may be agreeable enough to insert that remarkable Instance of <hi>Andrea de Valeta,</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to me by Signior <hi>Vigani,</hi> who had itfrom the Person himself: <hi>viz.</hi> That in the Kingdom of <hi>Granada,</hi> remote from the Sea, he saw an <hi>Indian</hi> Canoo or Boat dug out of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Rock. These all throughly consider'd undeniably evince an universal Deluge, which doubtless could not be any other than that of <hi>Noah,</hi> of which <hi>Moses</hi> gives so ample a relation; and if so, the recited Phaenomena amount to no less than a Demonstration of the Truth of what that inspired Philosopher has transmitted to us.</p>
               <p>As to the Forms of other <hi>Fossile Plants</hi> found in solid Rocks, as some not far from the Coal-Mines adjacent to <hi>Latham,</hi> where I have seen the Impressions of <hi>Polypody, Maiden-hair</hi> and <hi>Thorn Leaves</hi> in an hard greyish Rock, imprinted in a Black bituminous Matter. I likewise ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in a Marble near <hi>Holker,</hi> the Lineaments of a Man; and in <hi>Pool</hi>'s Hole near <hi>Buxton</hi> Bath, the Representations of several other Creatures, and various Modifications of Matter. These I take to be purely the wanton Sportings of the <hi>Fluor Stalactites,</hi> and do believe these <hi>Lusus Naturae</hi> are caused by different Mixtures of bituminous, saline and terrene Particles; and are not the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of Plants in the Deluge, which in that universal Destruction subsided with the broken <hi>Strata</hi> according to specifick Gravitation.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Halsil</hi> near <hi>Ormskirk</hi> is a Bituminous <hi>Turf,</hi> which emits a Smell like the Oyl of <hi>Amber;</hi> and from it may be prepared an Oyl not easily distinguishable from the former, and answers all the Intentions of that noble Medicine, but this must be discreetly manag'd, otherwise it contracts a foetid <hi>Empyeuma.</hi> Pieces of this by the Country People are made use of instead of Candles, and burn like Torches; I have seen it flame upon the surface of Water, as long as any part above its superficies remain'd. Where this is got there floats a bituminous Oyl, I have seen strange Effects of it in preserving Raw Flesh, which comes near to the Aegyptian <hi>Mummy.</hi>

The <hi>Morasses</hi> are made Arable by Draining and Marling them, and bring then very good Corn; they frequently pare off the Tops of these with Push-plows, which the amass together in small Heaps, when they are dry they set them on Fire, and by their alcalious Ashes the Ground is made very Fertile, but will not continue so above three Years, after that it is very Barren.

                  <p>Of <hi>Mines</hi> and <hi>Minerals,</hi> as <hi>Coal-Mines, Kennel-Mines</hi> their various sorts; the Method of Discovering them. An Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Sparrs, Talcs, Stalactites, Asbestus, Allum</hi> and <hi>Vitriol Ores; Salt Ores</hi> of various sorts, <hi>Salt Rocks, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur Ores;</hi> the <hi>Pyrites,</hi> Native <hi>Vitriol, Salts</hi> of various kinds; <hi>Mineral Damps,</hi> and <hi>Diamonds.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is an Observation as common as true, and which may justly challenge our Admiration, That the <hi>Mines</hi> in all Parts of the World (I mean <hi>Coal</hi> and <hi>Kennel-Mines)</hi> are always found in <hi>Strata,</hi> shelving towards the Center; or as the Miners call it, Dipping: Insomuch, that the same which in one part perhaps cannot be discover'd under Twenty Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome, is yet at the Rise of the <hi>Mine</hi> frequently found near the Surface of the Ground: These generally keep the same Dip as the Coal <hi>Slat</hi> that lies over them, and by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you speedily disclose the <hi>Mine;</hi> and whatever the Miners may pretend, so far as I have been able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61347:51"/>
more certain Directions for the Discovery of these <hi>Mines</hi> cannot be given. If the <hi>Mines</hi> ly in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable <hi>Strata,</hi> (or as the Work-men stile it) ly True, their usual Dip is <hi>East</hi> or <hi>West;</hi> or as they vulgarly word it, to the Twelve-a-Clock, or Four-a-Clock Sun. In these <hi>Mines</hi> are those luxuriant Springs of <hi>Acidulae,</hi> that it would be impossible ever to make them serviceable, if they lay not in this shelving Posture: For did they ly in an Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Plane, they wou'd most commonly not be found under some Hundred Fathoms, and then the Quantities of Water wou'd be too great for any Engine to discharge. It was therefore, no doubt, the wonderful Providence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty at the universal Deluge, in the Disruption of the Earth, that as the Psalmist terms it, <hi>They started aside like a broken Bow,</hi> to remain as everlasting Monuments of his Power, as well as Kindness to Mankind: And a farther Argument of his infinite Goodness is, that they are most commonly found in cold Climes, and not in those Regions where they have a more kindly Influence of the Sun. To pretend to solve the Postures of these, in so great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion as was at the Deluge, by specifick Gravity, is I think but to trifle in Terms: For Mechanically to account for these wonderful Phaenomena, wou'd be an Undertaking equal to that Genius who so easily discover'd a Pacing-Saddle, or preserv'd Antiphthisical Air in Bottles brought from <hi>Montpellier.</hi> In these <hi>Mines</hi> it is plain no specifick Gravitation is observ'd, for <hi>Coals, Strata</hi> of Marle, Coal <hi>Slats,</hi> in all the Mines I have seen always ly promiscuously; for sometimes you come to a <hi>Stratum</hi> of Marle, afterwards to a <hi>Stratum</hi> of Free-stone, Iron-stone, or the <hi>Pyrites;</hi> then to a Coal or Kennel-Mine, then to a <hi>Stratum</hi> of several Kinds again, and then to Coals or Kennel again, and sometimes to Coals above them all; from which it is evident, that in their subsidence they were not determin'd to any specifick Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but as Dr. <hi>More</hi> terms it, were solely govern'd by an <hi>Hylarchic Spirit.</hi> These things premised, I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61347:51"/>
to the Phaenomena frequently observ'd in them, As the constituent Principles of <hi>Coals,</hi> their <hi>Mineral Waters, Damps,</hi> and <hi>Pyrites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coals</hi> may be said to consist of Bitumen or Sulphureous parts, Vitriolic and Ferruginous, sometimes interlarded with a mixture of Ocre and Terrence parts; the sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Particles are easily distinguishable by their Burning, <hi>viz.</hi> By their Smell and the azure Colour of the Flame; the Vitriolic parts are prov'd two ways, <hi>first,</hi> I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times seen Native <hi>Vitriol</hi> in these Mines: <hi>secondly,</hi> By Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation; as more particularly in the Kennel near <hi>Haigh,</hi> from which by Distillation in a Retort, will come over a very austere Vitriolic Water: Besides the Springs that issue out of these do sometimes afford us quantities of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> as I have before remark'd. Their ferruginous Particles are discover'd in the Cinder, by their adhesion to the Magnet, which I take to be a Pathognomonical Symptom of <hi>Iron</hi> in that case, tho' Dr. <hi>Lister</hi> is pleas'd to stile it one of the <hi>Pyrites:</hi> But when the Dr. is framing an Hypothesis, he is no Slave to his Senses; and by the same Parity of Reason, he might put forth Comments upon <hi>Transubstantiation. Ocres</hi> frequently adhere to Coal, as do the Bass and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene parts: As to the <hi>Pyrites,</hi> that darling <hi>Proteus</hi> of the Dr. which at a dead-lift helps him to a Solution of any Phaenomenon, and which has given him the Character of a profound Naturalist amongst several Persons, perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were incapable to apprehend him; nor indeed can I think he apprehends, or believes himself those Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he lays down concerning this <hi>Pythagorical</hi> Gentleman the <hi>Pyrites.</hi> This <hi>Pyrites</hi> is frequently found betwixt the <hi>Lamellae</hi> of the Coals, and sometimes in <hi>Fissures</hi> and <hi>Strata:</hi> These by their Configuration to the Receptacles in which they are disclosed, appear to have once been fluid; I have seen some Cubical, others in Pentagons, and some rolled up in Magdalons, and Striated like Cockle-shells, in lines exactly like those; a Collection of these I have by me, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61347:52"/>
design them for the <hi>Musaeum</hi> at <hi>Oxford.</hi> Others I have seen in the Shape of the <hi>Pectinites.</hi> The <hi>Pyrites</hi> consists of <hi>Sulphur, Vitriol, Ocre,</hi> Metallick parts, as <hi>Iron, Copper,</hi> &amp;c. Of this there are various sorts, as the <hi>Aureus, Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus, Ferreus, Cupreus.</hi> The <hi>Sulphur</hi> is distinguishable in it by the Detonation it makes with <hi>Nitre,</hi> as likewise by the sulphureous Smell which by Collision may be observ'd in it. The <hi>Vitriol</hi> is known by its Germination, which it frequently emits expos'd in the Air. The <hi>Ocre,</hi> and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick parts are discover'd by Calcination and Fusion, and of these I have seen several Essays. These are the most noted Phaenomena I cou'd ever observe in this Minion of Dr. <hi>Lister;</hi> but if he wou'd have greater Matters credited of it, he surely writes not what he has seen, but what he fancies: Let him first oblige the World with more ample and convincing Discoveries of its Merit, otherwise why should we Attribute to it more than its Value? It may be freely said of this as of most of the Dr's Notions, <hi>All is not Gold that glisters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sparrs</hi> there are of several sorts, but the most Noted may be reduced to these Classes, the Rhomboidal Pellucid <hi>Spar,</hi> the Sapphirine Rhomboidal, or Azure <hi>Spar,</hi> the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace Azurine <hi>Spar,</hi> the Alabastrites and the Stalactites, the Pellucid irregular <hi>Spar,</hi> the Diamond <hi>Spar,</hi> so denominated from its figure: These all will run, and are commonly made use of by the Miners to run down their Ores. These are a Composition of Vitriolic Salts, Sulphurs, and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Particles: The Sulphur is discernible by Calcination, as are likewise the Saline, and Terrene Particles, which are very austere, and like a Bole will adhere to the Tongue. The Rhomboidal Spar is frequently found in the Mines in <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> and is constituted with various <hi>Lamellae,</hi> which are all Rhomboidal; which figure no doubt proceeds from a particular mixture of Saline and Terrene parts. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I have seen Sparrs consisting of various Parallelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams; these are Pellucid like Diamonds, and will cut Glass,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61347:52"/>
and are frequently found in Mole-Hills, at <hi>Downham</hi> in <hi>Lancashire:</hi> These are not to be found by Digging, as I have been inform'd by several of the Neighbouring Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, from what Depth therefore these Earthy Pioneers do bring them up is uncertain; they are call'd by the Names of <hi>Downham-Diamonds.</hi> The Sapphirine or Azure <hi>Spar</hi> is frequently found in <hi>Copper</hi> and <hi>Lead</hi> Mines in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cashire</hi> and <hi>Derbyshire;</hi> some are more Opace than others, which no doubt proceeds from the different mixture of Saline and Earthy parts. The <hi>Alabastrites</hi> and <hi>Stalactites</hi> are found plentifully in those most noted Cavities, <hi>Pool</hi>'s <hi>Hole,</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi>'s-<hi>Arse</hi> in the <hi>Peak</hi> in <hi>Derbyshire:</hi> These are not so pellucid as the other, therefore seem to contain a greater proportion of Terrene, and less of Saline Particles. The Figures which these <hi>Stalactites</hi> shoot into are Wonderful, and to a Thinking Man the most diverting Objects in the Universe. In some places the Cavity is scarce a Yard deep, in others an Hundred Fathoms perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular, of a most magnificent Arch: From the Top of this vast Roof there continually drops a Water, which forms various <hi>Lamellae</hi> of the <hi>Stalactites,</hi> in the shape of Hay-cocks, Lyons, Men, Fret-work, and several other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Phaenomena.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Woodward</hi> supposes the <hi>Stalactites</hi> to be form'd by the Water in some <hi>Strata</hi> of Earth, filtring from the Spar, and so according to the position of Particles, to constitute various <hi>Lamellae</hi> of Spar. I shall not deny but this in part may be true, yet in those Cavities it is most certain the Water forms various <hi>Lamellae</hi> of Spar, after it is fallen from the Rock, as is very discernible in those little Hills call'd Hay-cocks, upon which the Water is continually drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and each Year forms various <hi>Lamellae</hi> of the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lactites;</hi> the Water is clear, and of a pleasant Tast, and in Distillation yields a good quantity of this Sparry Matter: Wherefore it is most probable, there is a continual solution of this kind of Matter, by some acid Esurine <hi>Halitus,</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:61347:53"/>
which may likely be the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of some of the Mines, or Minerals in those parts. I am farther confirm'd in this, because the Sparrs by Calcination are of a very austere styptick Tast; therefore it is most rational to think, that they may be some Vitriolate <hi>Effluvia</hi> which make this solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but are not to be discern'd in the Water, because the Saline Particles are sheath'd in the Terrene, and so cannot exert their pungent Qualities until they are disentangled: And hence it is that the Water, tho' it be highly saturated with these Spars, is yet of a pleasing Tast; and no doubt but a thorough Discovery of the Principles of these Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wou'd give us a satisfactory Account of the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gems, and might likewise be of Use in <hi>Physick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are different Kinds of these <hi>Sparrs;</hi> as to their internal Qualities, some if taken inwardly will Vomit, and Purge most violently, as that in the Lead Mines near <hi>Andlesack</hi> in <hi>Lancashire;</hi> and this no doubt consists in a great measure of Salt and Sulphur, which I take to be the reason that it is Emetic. But the Nature of this <hi>Spar</hi> will be more fully made out from the subsequent Instances, and the first is by Calcination, in which you may easily discover that a Pound of this will yield a Dram of <hi>Arsenic</hi> at the least, lying betwixt the <hi>Lamellae</hi> of the Spar. Whence therefore this comes to be of so Poisonous a Nature is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident: Notwithstanding this, the Neighbours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about will frequently take a Scruple at least of this in Fits of the <hi>Stone,</hi> in whom it vomits, purges, and works violently by Urine; in this Case, as they have frequently assured me, they have found great Relief: Whence the Vomiting and Purging proceed is evident, as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore observ'd, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Arsenical Sulphur; as likewise from that profuse quantity of Urine, which may sufficiently hint to us what kind of morbifick Matter it is, that causes the <hi>Diabetes,</hi> both from the Quickness of its poysonous Quality, and likewise the Sweetness of the Urine. There are some have been so daring, as to venture to take a Dram
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61347:53"/>
of this, particularly One <hi>Iames Barns</hi>'s Wife and Child, but alas! to their woful Experience they found the sad Effects of it; for in about Nine Hours afterwards they both Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired. The like Quantity of this, in about Three Hours time, will Kill a Dog; and it is observable, that the Dog while living is deeply Lethargick, which may farther il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate to us, in malignant <hi>Feavers</hi> attended with those Symptoms, what kind of Matter probably it is that causes those Symptoms; but that is more fully Discussed in its proper place. Nay, so spreading is the Poyson of this Spar, that it has not only been fatal to the Creature that has taken it, but a Dog by licking the Blood of a Swine, which had accidentally taken it mix'd with Meal and Butter, expired likewise; and it is farther observable, that the Flesh of the Swine was afterwards Eaten, and did no mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief tho' the Blood was poysonous; because as we may reasonably conjecture, the Arsenic had not spread it self farther than the Mass of Blood.</p>
               <p>There is likewise in the same Mine a Black <hi>Spar,</hi> which affords a diverting Phaenomenon; or perhaps by some may be esteem'd a melancholly Scene, which is in the following manner, If you calcine this Spar in a Crucible, its sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Particles so diffuse themselves in the ambient Air, that the Persons standing by, by their Paleness resemble the Corps of so many deceas'd Persons. It is further remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that there are sometimes Cavities in the Body of this, and likewise in the Lead-Ore, which are impleted with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, tho' there are no apparent Aqueducts leading to them; these by the Miners are stiled <hi>Self-Loughs:</hi> Whence this Water is deriv'd may merit our Consideration; but it is most probable it is rais'd from the more remote Bowels of the Earth, by a subterraneous Heat, and collected in those Cavities; so that it is undeniably demonstrable, that the aqueous Particles must penetrate the Pores of the Rocks, Sparrs and Ores, which will more plainly illustrate to us how sometimes in those kinds of Cavities there are found
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61347:54"/>
living <hi>Toads,</hi> which some have had the vanity to fix there ever since <hi>Noah</hi>'s Deluge; but from the <hi>Ova,</hi> or Eggs float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Particles of the Water, it is most probable to conclude they bred there. Others are Diuretical, and are frequently taken with success in the Gout and Stone, which no doubt they effect by their saline Particles inciding the <hi>Lentor</hi> in the Blood, and so consequently give ease in those Cases: Instances of this kind I have seen several, but to insert them here is forein to this Undertaking. These are the most remarkable Phaenomena I have observ'd of <hi>Sparrs,</hi> I shall therefore in the next place hasten to <hi>Talcs</hi> and <hi>Amianthus,</hi> or that which is call'd <hi>Feather'd Allum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Talcs</hi> are pellucid, and frequently found in Marle, and will easily calcine into brittle white <hi>Lamellae,</hi> and would no doubt make a very good Plaister, which in the Malt-Kilns might be of great use, being far better than those common Clay-Floors; this is not at present made use of any farther than a common Mortar, but its farther Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement succeeding Generations may discover.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Amianthus</hi> is likewise found in Marle, it consists of various Filaments, and is that which the Ancients made their perpetual Lamp with; I have seen Cloath and Paper made of this, which would stand Fire, and doubtless it would be highly worth the while of some of our ingenious Mechanicks to make farther Essays upon it. It is call'd by some the <hi>Salamander's Wool,</hi> because, as I imagin, like that it is able to withstand the fury of the Flame: <hi>Iuncker</hi> and <hi>Etmuller</hi> give us an account of its Principles, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of some Tryals they have made upon it; I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore refer the Reader to those Authors. It is used by some Physicians in Unguents, in Distempers of the Nerves, but for my part I cannot see what use it can be of in those Cases; I cannot conceive how so sluggish and unactive a Body can penetrate and open the Obstructions of the Nerves, nor is it likely that its Particles should be absorb'd by the Capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Vessels, and so destroy that Acidity of the Blood that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61347:54"/>
may occasion the Distemper. The next thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd are the <hi>Allum</hi> and <hi>Vitriol-Ores,</hi> and of these there are various sorts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vitriol</hi> is a Salt so denominated from its being like Glass pellucid, and of this there are three sorts, White, Red and Green. The Red is found in the Mines in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the White and Green in <hi>Lancashire</hi> and <hi>Derbyshire:</hi> The Green is either Natural or Artificial; Natural, such as is that in the <hi>Kennel-Pits</hi> at <hi>Haigh</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and in some Lead-Mines near <hi>Castleton</hi> in <hi>Derbyshire;</hi> Artificial, such as is prepar'd from the <hi>Pyrites,</hi> by Calcination and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation. Of the Green there are two sorts, the one spongy and the other solid, but with Galls all yield the same Phaenomena. Of the White likewise are two sorts, the solid and the <hi>Trichites,</hi> the solid is found sometimes in <hi>Laminae,</hi> betwixt those of the mineral Bass, or <hi>Shiver,</hi> as the Miners term it; the <hi>Trichites</hi> is an Efflorescence from the Ores in the form of Hairs, and for that reason so stiled from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifies an Hair; the Ores of these are commonly Bass, and as I suppose have their Pores so configurated, as not to admit of other Salts, and with these Salts we do imagin they may be impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Bowels of the Earth, by the ascending <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia,</hi> or by those Particles which fall from the Atmosphere, as is evident from those Stones near <hi>Hess-Cassel</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> which by exposing them to the Air, afford at several times a greater quantity of <hi>Vitriol</hi> than the whole substance of the Stone amounts to. The white <hi>Vitriol</hi> is frequently found mixed with <hi>Allum,</hi> which I suppose might give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to some to make no difference betwixt those Salts; but they may easily be distinguish'd, for the vitriolic Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles will spend themselves in Efflorescences in the Air, but the alluminous remain fix'd; and then it is, and not till then, that the <hi>Allum</hi> ought to be prepar'd. <hi>Roch-Allum</hi> we have at <hi>Brindle</hi> and <hi>Houghton</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> where great quantities might be made, those Parts being most
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61347:55"/>
modious of any in the Kingdom for this Business, since they may be so easily supply'd with that Sea-plant which the <hi>Arabians</hi> call'd <hi>Kali,</hi> and we in our Idiome <hi>Kolp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Allum,</hi> as well as <hi>Vitriol,</hi> is most commonly found in Bass, and as we suppose may challenge the like production; they differ likewise in their Figure in Chrystallization, yet neither of them do at all times shoot into one and the same Figure. Here one Question of moment offers it self to our Enquiry, <hi>(viz)</hi> Whether or no green and white <hi>Vitriol</hi> be specifically different, or only differ in Colour as they are differently saturated with some Ore or Mineral: It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain I have in the same mineral Water observ'd, both green and white <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and likewise out of the same Ore both green and white <hi>Vitriol</hi> make their Efflorescences; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it seems probable to me that these two are not specifical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different, but that the one consists of a more compact and close Texture, and the other of more loose Particles: I am farther confirm'd in this Opinion, because I find that they will both turn black with Galls, and are both Emetic. The Ores of <hi>Vitriol</hi> are either Marcasite, or Bass; the Methods of making <hi>Vitriol</hi> have been before recited, both in the <hi>Philosophical Transactions,</hi> and in a Piece of Mr. <hi>Ray</hi>'s; I shall not therefore transgress on the patience of my Reader.</p>
               <p>As to marine <hi>Salts</hi> they either make their Efflorescences out of some kind of Limes, or Bass, as I have observ'd upon several Walls in <hi>Lancashire;</hi> and upon the blew Bass in <hi>Cheshire</hi> sometimes upon old Walls may be observ'd <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petre,</hi> and oftentimes an alcalious fix'd Salt, which I take to be the <hi>Natron</hi> of the Ancients; and which we likewise find in some Waters in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> as in those near <hi>Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> and <hi>Burnley.</hi> If the Use of this Salt was fully prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, it would doubtless be of great Benefit, as far sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing all our artificial Alcalies, if we may judge of it either by the Phaenomena observable in it, or from those Accounts which the Ancients give of it, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Dios<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides;</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:61347:55"/>
and <hi>Vauslebius,</hi> a modern Author, in his Account of the Plague at <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> assures us of the wonderful Efficacy of this Salt, of which he himself was an Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for tho' Hundreds in a Week constantly expir'd of the Plague then raging, yet so soon as the <hi>Nitre</hi> falls, which they know by the Turgidness of the <hi>Nile,</hi> and the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and rising of the <hi>Nitre-</hi>Pits, the Sickness imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ceases. <hi>Polyd. Virgil</hi> informs us that the first Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Glass was by an Accident which happen'd from this Salt, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Some Merchants who had been at <hi>Nitria,</hi> a place in <hi>Egypt</hi> where it is collected in greatest quantities, taking several large pieces of <hi>Natron</hi> on board their Vessels, and having a mind to go on Shore for their Diversion, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd some Piles of it to be rais'd on the Ground, upon which they might fix their Kettles, as on Furnaces, to boil their Meat; but when the Fire grew to an intense heat, the Salt and Sand flux'd together, and ran into a transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Glass, a Method not much unlike that which is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic'd from the Ashes of <hi>Kali;</hi> how far therefore it might be useful upon this Account, deserves our Consideration.</p>
               <p>Rocks of <hi>Salt</hi> of a vast thickness are frequently found in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> some of them twenty-five Yards or more thick; but whence these came, whether from the universal Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe of the World at the Deluge, or have been since form'd in the bowels of the Earth, admits our next En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. It is observ'd that such a quantity of Water will only dissolve such a proportion of Salt, nor will the Salt after dissolution precipitate; if then we imagin these Rocks to proceed from the Deluge, we must conclude that vast Globe of Water that drown'd the World, to be more satu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with Salt than any of the Brine-springs in <hi>Cheshire;</hi> and if so, the Rocks of Salt had been universal over the World. Wherefore to me the most rational Conjecture is, That upon the Rupture of the <hi>Strata</hi> of the Earth, Islands of those Salt-Rocks floated in the Flood, and so for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable time might be tossed to and fro undissolv'd, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61347:56"/>
in that general Confusion upon the subsiding of the Water, might settle with the rest of the Mines and Minerals, and so have continued in the Posture we find them ever since. I have before demonstrated that the Brine-springs do not proceed from the Rocks of Salt that are already discover'd, but from the Rocks that lie deeper in the Bowels of the Earth, or it may be from none at all, because the Figures of the Salt are different; I shall not therefore insist further upon that Point, but pass on to what I next propos'd; and that is to give an Account of <hi>Allum,</hi> and its various Ores.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Allum</hi> may be divided into three Classes, the <hi>Roch,</hi> the <hi>Feather'd,</hi> and the <hi>Trichites,</hi> the which is made most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly from an Ash-colour'd Bass, and is frequently mix'd with white Vitriol, as may be observ'd in the Ores in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cashire</hi> and <hi>Derbyshire:</hi> The <hi>Feather'd Allum,</hi> as was noted before, is often found in reddish Marles near <hi>Thern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in <hi>Lancashire.</hi> The Uses of these are so notorious, I shall not insist upon them.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>Mineral</hi> that bears the nearest affinity to its Salts is the <hi>Downham-Diamond;</hi> these, as we hinted, are cast up by the Moles, and in those little Mountains often discover'd after showers of Rain, I have seen some of them as dazling as those from <hi>India,</hi> and would likewise for some time cut Glass, but not like those continue it. The Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> and Seignior <hi>Bret</hi> have given us a large Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Formation, to whom therefore I refer my Reader; only in short I shall give you my own Conjecture, which is that I take them to be a Composition of saline and terrene Particles, perhaps not unlike those of the most refin'd Sparrs; and in this I was confirm'd by the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination of them, in which I could discover a perfect vitriolic Taste, and found a cretaceous Matter; but this I presume is in that small proportion, and so curiously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven with the saline Particles, that the whole Body becomes transparent, as we see in those of Glass the like Phaenomena are observable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:61347:56"/>
The next <hi>Minerals</hi> to be prosecuted are the <hi>Sulphurs,</hi> of which various kinds are observable in these Countries, as in Mines, Metals and Minerals; and these, as they are united with different Bodies, may be rang'd into several Classes: some may be call'd <hi>Vitriolic Sulphurs,</hi> because con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of oily and vitriolic Particles, and form that Body which we commonly call <hi>Brimstone,</hi> and these are observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Coal-Mines, Mineral-Basses, Ores, Metals and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; others are <hi>Oleaginous Sulphurs,</hi> as the <hi>Halitus</hi> in the <hi>Burning-Well</hi> near <hi>Wigan,</hi> the Sulphur-Damps in several Mines, and the burning Turf near <hi>Halls-hall,</hi> and a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur different from all these is observable in <hi>Lead, Copper,</hi> and the <hi>Pyrites.</hi> But to give a clear Idea of all these I shall delineate their several Effects, by which the Reader will the better judge of their constituent parts.</p>
               <p>I shall therefore in the next place proceed to the <hi>Oily</hi> and <hi>Metallic Sulphurs:</hi> The <hi>Oily Sulphurs</hi> are easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable, but in their burning have no smell; these are observable in the <hi>Burning-Well</hi> near <hi>Wigan,</hi> and the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Damps in Coal-Mines, as was before hinted: sometimes these take Fire by Collision, and sometimes by Accension, as from the flames of the Candles the Miners work with, and then too often produce dismal Effects, as the blowing Men out of the Shafts, scorching them to Death, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times destroying the Works. The Effects of these are as fatal as those of Lightning, and frequently present us with very odd Phaenomena, as the rending in pieces prodigious Rocks, ejecting several great Stones perpendicular, with a thousand other Disasters in the Works. From these things to me it seems plain, the wonderful Effects produc'd from Lightning upon Animals, are chiefly from their sulphureous Particles, by a total and sudden dissipation of the animal Spirits, whence necessarily follows a coagulation of the Blood, and consequently Death: Wherefore in these Cases to save the Life of the Patient, if possible, as was inserted before in the Chapter of <hi>Air,</hi> speedy bleeding in the Jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61347:57"/>
or Arms is to be us'd, Cupping-Glasses, volatile Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Friction, Epispastics, and the like, are the Methods to be taken; and not to trifle with Milk, expecting that to imbibe the Poyson, as is the common Custom.</p>
               <p>Other Sulphurs are observable in Lead and Lead-Ores, the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of which are apt to produce <hi>Palsies,</hi> the <hi>Byon,</hi> and <hi>Consumption;</hi> in these a metallic corrosive Salt is united with the Sulphur, and so either by causing a coagulation of the <hi>Lympha,</hi> or <hi>serum</hi> of the Blood, entangles the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, obstructs the Lungs or Nerves, and so produces the fore-recited Distempers. The <hi>Byon</hi> is not much unlike a <hi>Quinsy,</hi> the symptoms running parallel, and no doubt but the like Method in that as in an essential <hi>Quinsy</hi> ought to be taken. The Sulphur of the <hi>Pyrites</hi> will easily fulmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with <hi>Nitre,</hi> which <hi>Pyrites</hi> is a Complex of different metallic Particles, as they are found in different Mines, as in <hi>Lead, Copper, Iron, Antimony,</hi> &amp;c. as was before related. Sulphur is discernable in some mineral Waters by their smell, and by a Reverberation of the sulphureous Steams of hot Baths in <hi>Cupulos,</hi> native Sulphur may be collected. Sulphur by the <hi>Greeks</hi> is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because they thought in this, in those times of Heathenism, the Gods descended, and by Thunder and Lightning destroy'd the Provinces: But by modern Authors it is taken for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable or oily Concrete from some mineral Acid, which is render'd evident in the preparation of common <hi>Brimstone,</hi> which contains both an inflammable Oyl, and an acid Spirit, and accordingly as the Acid is united with the Sulphur, the Sulphur is benign or poysonous; hence it is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Brimstone</hi> may more safely be taken, because it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a mild Acid; but the Sulphurs of <hi>Antimony, Arsenic,</hi> and other Minerals, are poysonous because they contain more penetrating Salts, and so inflame and lacerate the Vessels.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Mineral Damps</hi> it is observable that they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue upon the surface of the Water in the Mine the space
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61347:57"/>
of a Month at least, in an Oval form, as the Miners assur'd me, and then frequently break; at which time, if the Miners be within the Works, they are often suffocated: I discours'd with one who had like to have perish'd by them; he told me he perceiv'd a sudden Coldness to strike to his Heart, as he term'd it, and an extraordinary sweetness in his Mouth, that he lay like a Person in a Swooning Fit, and was not sensible of either Pain or Sickness, nor could he remember any thing farther, save that he drew his Breath short as he recover'd, and was drowsy for some time afterwards. The Phaenomena seem to indicate these Damps to consist of arsenical Sulphurs, and vitriolic <hi>Effluvia,</hi> which suddenly entangle the Spirits, and so produce a Coagulation of the whole Mass of Blood, and consequently Death it self, if not speedily prevented. The way the Persons have in those Cases to save themselves, is by digging an Hole in the Earth, and lieing in it upon their Faces till such time as the Damp has spent it self; and sometimes by shooting at it, and so firing it out: One of the Men, whose Ignorance led him to Superstition, affirm'd it to be an infernal Spirit; and indeed if a Man reflect upon the Wickedness of most of the Miners, one might have too much reason to conclude that they have too great a Correspondence with such sort of Company, their Morals being inconsistent with any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; there is scarce a vicious Act but they are guilty of it, their Folly is as notorious as their Vice; after all their toilsom Labours for a whole Week in dismal obscure Cells, the product of all their six Days Work is generally on the seventh expended in Drunkenness and Lewdness.</p>
               <p>Sometimes in these <hi>Mines</hi> are observable mineral Earths, by the Miners call'd <hi>Coke,</hi> and <hi>Toftan,</hi> but to me they seem a courser sort of Sparrs: These, as the Miners affirm, are unerring Indications of Lead, and when they come to those <hi>Minerals,</hi> they will pretend to tell you how far they are from Lead; but too much Confidence is not to be given to these Assertions, for I have observ'd these <hi>Minerals</hi> to be where
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61347:58"/>
no Lead could ever be found; nor indeed considering the various Bodies Lead is found in, is there any reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude these to be the preceding Characteristicks of that Metal; but these things being to be more fully consider'd in the Chapter of <hi>Metals,</hi> I shall not expatiate upon them in this, but to that refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Metals</hi> in these Countries are <hi>Lead, Iron,</hi> and <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;</hi> the <hi>Metallis affinia,</hi> or Bodies betwixt <hi>Metals</hi> and <hi>Minerals,</hi> are <hi>Antimony, Black-Lead,</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis Calaminaris. Lead-Ore</hi> is frequently found either in Sparrs, white Sand, (some of which is as white as the most refin'd Sugars I have seen) in the Fissures either of Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone or Free-stone, and then it runs in Veins, as the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men call it: These are of different sizes, sometimes the <hi>Mine</hi> being a quarter of a Yard diameter, and the same <hi>Mine</hi> sometimes not above an Inch, and a little after the the Rock clasping together, the Vein entirely disappears, thro' which the Miners continuing to work recover the Vein of <hi>Metal</hi> as formerly; this kind of <hi>Ore</hi> is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly found in the Fissures of Lime and Free-stone. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind of <hi>Lead-Ore</hi> is found in Lumps, and that in white Sand, as in the Lead-Mines near <hi>Keswick.</hi> There are four sorts of <hi>Lead-Ore,</hi> viz. the <hi>Spar-Ore, Coke-Ore, Potter's Ore,</hi> and <hi>White Ore:</hi> The <hi>Spar</hi> and <hi>Coke-Ore</hi> are about equal Value, and are fluxed with white Wood in Furnaces for that purpose, and they usually run about a fourth or fifth; <hi>Potter's Ore</hi> will not lose above a seventh, and frequently contains a proportion of Silver; the <hi>White Ore</hi> is a natural <hi>Ceruss,</hi> and yields a greater quantity of <hi>Metal</hi> than any of the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iron Ores</hi> there are of four sorts, as the <hi>Raddle-Ore, Clay-Ore, Blue Ore,</hi> and the <hi>Button-Ore,</hi> so call'd from lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle globular Protuberances that cover its superficies: The common way of fluxing these is by a large Blast with Wood-Charcoal; but I am inform'd that lately by the Cakes of Pit-Coal those Ores may be run into a malleable <hi>Iron;</hi> and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61347:58"/>
if so, the Profit in the Northern Parts will be extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, they having vast quantities of that Ore, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of Coals. 'Tis most certain it is nothing but the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of the Pit-Coal that renders the <hi>Iron</hi> brittle, and runs it to a <hi>Regulus,</hi> but whoever understands the fluxing of Metals, may easily by Lixivials and due Preparations know how to manage that Point. In the running down of all Metals a particular care ought to be taken of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, otherwise they will too often evaporate it, sink it into a Lithorhage, or run it down with the Cinders, by which means they have an opportunity at leisure to convert it to their own Use, and so to defraud the Proprietor: And unless this Disadvantage is prevented, tho there is a vast gainful prospect from the Mines in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> they will never answer expectation; for I my self have fluxed the same sort of Ore to a fourth of malleable Metal, whereas the Forger has only run it, as he averr'd, to a twentieth, nor would he account for any more to the Proprietor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Copper Ores</hi> may be reduc'd to the following Classes, <hi>viz.</hi> The Azure, the Green, the Golden, and the Cinerous, or Ash-colour'd; and these are found simply of themselves, and sometimes mixed with <hi>Iron, Lead</hi> and <hi>Antimony,</hi> of which I have various Specimens, but when the Ores are so compounded they never turn to Account. The Azure might for ought I know answer all the Intents of <hi>Ultra-Marine,</hi> and in fluxing will not lose above a twentieth Part; but of this the quantity is so small, that no great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage can be expected from it. The Golden Ore is so call'd from the <hi>Pyrites Aureus</hi> mixed with it, which gives it that Colour: Of these there are quantities sufficient, I do think, to supply all <hi>Europe,</hi> and were the Mines rightly manag'd, we should not have any necessity to import our <hi>Copper</hi> from <hi>Sweden,</hi> which would be of vast Advantage to the Kingdom; but either the Ignorance or Fraud of the Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is such, that the Product is in a manner destroy'd. The Method of rightly running this Metal is, by reducing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61347:59"/>
the Ore to a small Powder, and afterwards roasting it till all the Sulphur is evaporated, and then by an addition of lixivial Ashes. <hi>Nitre</hi> and <hi>Tartan,</hi> the Ore in a proper Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace will run to a fourth Part of malleable <hi>Copper;</hi> whence it is plain by the quantity of Ore got Weekly, that the Profit would be vastly considerable, but at present, for ought I can learn, they are so miserably manag'd, that they turn to no Account at all. The Green Ore is of two sorts, the Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and the Stoney: The Vitriolic will run to an half malleable, the Stoney not to a twentieth; and this may be done without either Roasting, or the Flux-powder, which in the Golden Ore cannot be effected. The Cinerous Ore must be fluxed as the Golden, and then it will run to one half malleable; and of this kind there are in <hi>Lancashire</hi> quantities sufficient.</p>
               <p>But that the Method of Essaying <hi>Metals</hi> may be more easily apprehended, I shall in each of them set down the particular Forms, which I found most practicable; and shall in the first place begin with <hi>Iron,</hi> and so descend to the rest. The Species of <hi>Iron Ore</hi> are all enumerated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wherefore I shall directly begin with the Process in running down that Metal, with some Experiments upon the <hi>Haematites</hi> or <hi>Blood-stone.</hi> The Furnace in which this is run down is about two Yards square, and so rises per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular a Yard or more; it is lined within with a Wall of the best Free-stone, to keep off the force of the Fire from the Walls of the Furnace; the Bellows which are large and moved by Water, enter about the middle of the <hi>Focus.</hi> The rest of the Furnace is rais'd upon this, six or seven Yards in a square or quadrangle, but tapering, so that the sides draw each other by degrees, and the top Hole or Orifice where they throw in Baskets of Stone and Fewel, is but half a Yard square; into this place they put down a Pole, to know how far it hath rested for a certain time, and when they find it to have subsided about a Yard and half, then they put in more till the Furnace is full again. There
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61347:59"/>
is a sort of <hi>Iron Ore</hi> that yields an <hi>Iron</hi> that is brittle when it is cold, this abounds with too great a quantity of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, however it may be made a <hi>Metal</hi> malleable as any of the rest, by reducing to Powder, and roasting the Ore till the Sulphur is sublimed, then running it down with common Salt or Pot-Ashes, or the Ashes of <hi>Ferns.</hi> There is another sort of Ore they call <hi>Red-shire,</hi> that is such an Ore which yields an <hi>Iron,</hi> which if hammer'd when red-hot proves very brittle; therefore these two melted down together produce a good sort of <hi>Iron.</hi> Their Fuel is <hi>Turf</hi> and <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal,</hi> and in some places <hi>Charcoal</hi> only; several trials have been made with <hi>Pit-coal,</hi> but all hitherto unsuccessful, that Fuel abounding with too great a quantity of Sulphur, by which the <hi>Metal</hi> is render'd friable; but I am apt to think if they used the <hi>Pit-coal</hi> made into <hi>Coke,</hi> that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency might be avoided; the dusty part of the <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal</hi> is useful for burning the Iron-stone; to every Basket of this burnt Stone they put in one of <hi>Brimstone,</hi> to make it melt freely, and cast the Cinders. This Mineral has a strange Effect upon <hi>Iron,</hi> as we see by the various Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made from it by this Body; the <hi>Rationale</hi> of which I take to be this, That the Body of the <hi>Iron</hi> is open'd by the Acid of the Sulphur, and so quits it self of the Cinder, or terrence Particles. 'Tis strange to imagin the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effects Acids have upon <hi>Iron,</hi> even the least of them making an alteration in that Body; the very Acidity of a <hi>Potato,</hi> which is not distinguishable by the Palate, will make the Metal when polish'd livid, and raise a Rust or <hi>Crocus</hi> upon its Superficies; other stronger Acids make a perfect solution of it, particularly Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> converts its Body into a green Chrystalline Salt, which may again be run down into malleable <hi>Iron:</hi> So wonderfully are the terreous Particles dissolv'd in <hi>Minimis,</hi> or as we express it, in <hi>Minia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that they are not to be discern'd by the naked Eye, or the best Microscopes. This Metal, if rightly prepar'd, comes nearer to a <hi>Panacea,</hi> or universal Medicine, than
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61347:60"/>
any Drug yet known, and in Chronic Scorbutic Cases is doubtless as much a Specific as the <hi>Peruvian Bark</hi> in Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Distempers, but this by the By; I shall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to other Phaenomena observable in its Fusion. In the midst of the Furnace is a Tunnel, at which they put in Charcoal, where it is kindled, then they add Ore broken into pieces about the bigness of a <hi>Pigeon</hi>'s Egg, so much as they intend to melt down; then they set their Bellows at work, and continue blowing about twelve Hours, feeding it still with new Charcoal as it settles; the glassy Cinder being very liquid, is let thro' an Hole at the bottom of the Wall; the <hi>Iron</hi> is left in a Conical Hole in the midst of the Hearth, which they take out with great Tongs, then put it under heavy Hammers, moved as the Bellows by Water, whereby after several heatings, in the same Furnace it is melted in, it is beaten into Bars: About an hundred Pounds Weight of Metal is gain'd at one Melting, which is the Product of about three times as much Ore. This indeed was the ancient way of running down <hi>Iron Ore,</hi> but of late the following Method is practic'd. They have a plain and open Hearth like that of a <hi>Black-Smith,</hi> without any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closing Walls, excepting where the Bellows enter there is an hollow place, which they fill and heap up with Charcoal; then lay the Ore broken small round it upon the flat of the Hearth to bake, or as some express it, to Roast or Aneel, and by degrees thrust it into the hollow, where it is melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Blast; the glassy <hi>Scoriae</hi> run very thin, but the Metal is never in a perfect Fusion, but runs into Clods or Masses, which taken out are beaten into Bars, as before: To some of this Ore adheres a green Chrystalline Spar, which consists of ferreous, vitriolic and terrene Particles; the ferreous Particles may be discover'd by Fusion, and the vitriolic, terrene and sulphureous Particles by Calcination; by which Method you may distinguish a strong sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Smell, and afterwards by exposing it to the Air may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern <note place="bottom">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Iohn Sturdy <hi>in the</hi> Philosoph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Transact.</note>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:61347:60"/>
vitriolic Efflorescences form'd like Needles, or small <hi>Bacilli.</hi> The soft <hi>Clay Ore</hi> is reddish, and is that which we may stile <hi>Haematites,</hi> equally good as that from <hi>East-India;</hi> the <hi>Tea-</hi>Pots in <hi>London</hi> made of it, and in <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> for Art and beautiful Colour, are not behind any from <hi>China.</hi> This Ore is frequently used with success for the <hi>Murrain</hi> in Cattle, and for all Diseases in Swine, to which latter they will give an handful or two in Milk; which may sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hint to us of what extraordinary Use it may be in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory Diseases, <hi>Quinsies,</hi> and Pestilential <hi>Fevers,</hi> and may in all likelihood, by a particular Composition of ferreous, saline and sulphureous Particles, far surpass all those <hi>Boles</hi> and <hi>seal'd Earths</hi> which we import from the <hi>Levant</hi> and the <hi>Indies;</hi> and may for ought I know in Chronic Cases likewise be a better Mixture to reduce the Mass of Blood to a right <hi>Crasis,</hi> than the most eminent Chymists could yet effect by their elaborate Preparations: And why may not this Ore, being open'd by a Volatile temperate Acid, answer all the Indications of the <hi>Acidulae</hi> in <hi>England?</hi> since what Phaenomena we find in the <hi>Acidulae</hi> by Galls, either as to Tincture, Precipitation, or Evaporation, may by preparing this Ore, as recited, and infusing it in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water, be observed. These are the most remarkable things which I took notice of in this Metal, we proceed next to <hi>Copper Ores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I shall give you a Process in making a small Essay to satisfy the Curious, what quantity of <hi>Copper</hi> the yellow Ore contains; it is effected in this following Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: Take twenty Penny-weight of <hi>Copper Ore,</hi> beat it in a Mortar and searce it fine, then put it into a Crucible thorowly Anneil'd; keep it constantly stirring in the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, placed in the Fire, with an Iron <hi>Spatula,</hi> otherwise it will run into minute Masses, and be very difficult to flux down the Metal, because the Flux-powder cannot so entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mix with the <hi>Copper</hi> Particles, so many of the <hi>Scoriae</hi> interposing: Let it thus be stirred about two Hours, or till
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61347:61"/>
it be of a dark Colour, not much unlike <hi>Aethiops</hi> Mineral, and emits no sulphureous Smell at all; for if the Sulphur be not entirely burnt off, it will carry off the Metal in Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or at least if there be any considerable quantity of it, convert it to a perfect <hi>Regulus,</hi> and be as brittle as Glass. I have seen a <hi>Regulus</hi> run from this sort of <hi>Copper Ore,</hi> which when taken out of the Furnace after Fusion, has been hard, but brittle, yet it has by lieing in the Air moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to a small Powder, in Colour not unlike the <hi>Pyrites,</hi> which I presume might be occasion'd by the Particles of the Air making a solution of the fixed Salt, which the Metal was run down withal, and so the Mass must necessarily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Powder, not unlike Coal-slates, in which by their long continuance in open Air we may observe the parallel Phaenomena. After the Ore is thus prepar'd, if it be that of <hi>Tilberthet</hi> or <hi>Cocklebeg</hi> in <hi>High-Furness</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> it will then weigh about seventeen Penny-weight and an half. After this to run down the Metal, proceed in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Method: Take of Crude <hi>Tartar</hi> and <hi>Nitre</hi> each, one Ounce, powder and mix them well together, afterwards flux them in a Mortar, which is thus done. Put an Iron <hi>Spatula,</hi> or any other piece of Iron red-hot into the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, continually stirring it till the great Emotion ceases, powder the remaining part when cool, and add to it two Penny-weight of <hi>Pit-coal</hi> beaten also to Powder; mix these with the prepared Ore, then put them all into a Crucible, place it in a Furnace armed with Bricks, with a Wall about a Foot square, and as much in perpendicular; cover the Crucible with a Plate of Iron, to reverberate the heat upon the Ore, by which means it more easily fuses; let the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows be blown with a moderate Blast, and keep the <hi>Focus</hi> of the Furnace from suffocating with Cinder, by frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elevating the Fire with the <hi>Spatula,</hi> or Iron <hi>Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> in about half an Hours time, or less, the Ore will run, which may be discern'd by the violent Boyling of the Salts: Then remove the Crucible from the Furnace, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61347:61"/>
strike it easily for some little time upon the Ground, which motion makes the <hi>Metal</hi> more readily to separate from the <hi>Scoriae.</hi> If when the Crucible is thus hot, you should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merse it half way in cold Water, it is diverting to observe, that this glowing Heat emits for a considerable time an actual Flame, occasion'd (as it is probable) by a Concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the Igneous or fiery Particles: The Crucible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cool, you will find at the bottom of it about six Penny weight of <hi>Copper;</hi> so that it is evident the Ore contains betwixt a third and fourth Part of <hi>Metal.</hi> If the <hi>Metal,</hi> occasion'd by the remaining Sulphur, should prove brittle after it is thus run down, you must then run it down again in the same Furnace, by addition of some <hi>Saltpetre,</hi> and by repeating the Fusion twice or thrice, you will have a malleable <hi>Copper,</hi> or that which the Workmen call <hi>fine Copper.</hi> This is the best Method for Essaying this sort of Ore that I ever yet could learn, nor do I think it can be well effected otherwise. The reason why the <hi>Saltpetre</hi> and <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> are thus prepar'd, is this, (tho' it is not usual in other Flux-powders, because the Ore abounds with so great a quantity of Sulphur) If the <hi>Saltpetre</hi> was not thus bridled with the fix'd Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> it would doubtless carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the greatest part of the Metal: I have been inform'd that this Ore when prepar'd as directed above, may be run down with <hi>Flanders-Ashes;</hi> and it is very likely it may be so; to Experiment which would be highly worth the time of the Gentlemen that are concern'd in <hi>Copper Mines;</hi> for by that means they may perhaps prevent the Expence of repeated Fires, which they are at before they can reduce it to malleable <hi>Copper.</hi> These are the most remarkable Phaenomena I have observ'd in Fusion of <hi>Copper Ore,</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed next to treat of the Fusion of <hi>Lead Ores;</hi> which is done only by roasting of the Sulphur, and afterwards in a common Furnace by running it down with white Wood.</p>
               <p>This Ore contains a very corrosive Sulphur, insomuch that when it was Essay'd in an Iron Vessel, I have known
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61347:62"/>
it corrode it quite in pieces, which Sulphur is I doubt not, the occasion of that Distemper the Smelters call the <hi>Byon.</hi> I have in some of these <hi>Mines</hi> observ'd a liquid Metal, not much unlike <hi>Quicksilver,</hi> but cannot aver it to be the same; and have frequently in <hi>Copper Mines</hi> seen small pieces of <hi>Virgin Copper</hi> malleable without Fusion; but how it came to be so, I do not determine, considering with what difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the Metal is ravish'd from its Ore; on that Topic there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leave every Person to his own Conjecture. There is some <hi>Lead Ore</hi> which contains Silver, which after Fusion may be separated from it with Spirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> and so both the Metals preserv'd. But let us consider farther this poysonous Sulphur of <hi>Lead,</hi> which will better be understood by the tragical and various effects which it produces, not only upon Human Kind, but upon Quadrupedes. The other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper is by the Miners call'd the <hi>Belland,</hi> which disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it self in the following Symptoms, A continual <hi>Asthma</hi> or difficulty of Breathing seizes the Patient, with a deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Appetite, his Complexion turns pale and yellowish; these are attended with a dry Cough and Hoarseness; swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Limbs and Joynts ensue, which are render'd useless. This Distemper may be taken either by working in the <hi>Lead-Mines,</hi> or by the Fumes of the Ore in smelt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: These very Symptoms happen to <hi>Horses</hi> and other Cattle; these generally take the Distemper either by feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Grass where the <hi>Lead-Ore</hi> is wash'd, or by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Water: In some <hi>Horses</hi> that have died of this Disease, the Ore has been found in Lumps and Masses in the Stomach. Let us now enquire into the Cause of these Distempers, since it may perhaps seem strange how an Ore without any diminution of its Substance in appearance, should so far affect the extreme Parts, as to cause them to swell, and render them useless: In prosecution of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I alledge that it is probable the Sulphur of the <hi>Lead</hi> is a Substance as minute as that of <hi>Antimony</hi> in <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> which we find by daily Experience will cause most violent Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61347:62"/>
without the least diminution of its Weight, why may not this Sulphur then enter the very <hi>Penetralia</hi> of the Nerves, and in those by its saline Particles produce a Corrugation, and by that means obstruct the Influence of such a proportion of Spirits as are necessary to Nutrition? Hence the Blood becomes dispirited, and performs not its due Circulation, but stagnates in various parts of the Body; the <hi>Serum</hi> becomes Effoete and Viscid, and thence proceed the Hoarseness, Asthma, weakness and swellings of the Joynts. It is probable this Distemper in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, before it has too far affected the Nerves, might be cured by repeated Emeticks, but after it has once advanc'd to that State, all Endeavours are vain.</p>
               <p>In the Discovery of these <hi>Mines,</hi> I do not find that the Miners use the <hi>Virgula Divina,</hi> or the Forked and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Hasel,</hi> but the Ore generally discovers it self in the Fissures of Rocks; and this they follow till they break into the Bole or Trunk of it, which resembles the Trunk, and its Veins, the Boughs of a Tree. I have sometimes obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Center of a piece of Lime-stone, like a <hi>Frog</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in Amber; an entire piece of <hi>Ore,</hi> without any Strings or Leaders directing to it; which brings me in the next place to consider the Formation of <hi>Ores,</hi> whether they germinate, or are the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of the Deluge.</p>
               <p>It is affirm'd of the <hi>Iron Mines</hi> in the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi>'s Country, that in 3 Years time the same Mine will be as pregnant with <hi>Ore,</hi> as it was before it was exhausted: Which Instance to luxurious Wits has afforded sufficient grounds to descant upon the Germination of <hi>Metals,</hi> even to that excess, that some fond Opiniatres who have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the metallic Tree in a Course of <hi>Chymistry,</hi> have almost reduc'd the <hi>Metals</hi> to <hi>Vegetables;</hi> but he that considers the Fissures of the Rocks, and the closing of those again, where the <hi>Metal</hi> entirely disappears, no Strings leading to the subsequent Body, and likewise the preceding Instance in Lime-stone, together sometimes with petrify'd Plants,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61347:63"/>
Shells, Bones, and the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of Fishes, unless for the fake of being stiled an Atheist, he would be esteem'd a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, he cannot conclude these to be any thing else but the Ruins of an universal Deluge; and in a serious Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of these in those dark Recesses of Nature, the Power of the Almighty is as discernible, as in the great Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries of the Universe. As to that Instance of the <hi>Iron Mine</hi> in the Grand Duke of <hi>Tuscany</hi>'s Country, this may be said: 'Tis probable it is a soft Ore, which by the <hi>Effluvia</hi> continually ascending from the Central part of the Earth, may carry along with them metallic Particles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently in such a space of time fill up those Vacuities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, or the empty spaces whence the Ore was extracted; which Phaenomenon to an inconsidering Eye, might give reason to judge the <hi>Ore</hi> Vegetated. Having now discover'd the ways of Finding, Essaying, the Site and Formation of <hi>Metals,</hi> I proceed in the next place to the Methods of their Separation, and thence to the <hi>Metallis affinia,</hi> and so I shall close this Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Separation of <hi>Metals</hi> from <hi>Ores</hi> is twofold, either by <hi>Menstruum,</hi> or the <hi>Test,</hi> which Artificers call the <hi>Couple:</hi> The <hi>Menstruum,</hi> if the Ore contains Copper, Gold or Silver, is Spirit of <hi>Nitre, Aqua fortis,</hi> or <hi>Aqua Regia,</hi> which make a solution of the metallic Particles, and by Alcalies may easily be precipitated, and then by Fusion you may judge what quantity of Metal the Ore contains. The Separation by the <hi>Test</hi> is the common Method of the Mint, and of the <hi>Silver-Smiths;</hi> which being a particular Trade, and not properly the Province of <hi>Natural History,</hi> I shall not interfere in that Business, but to those I shall refer the Curious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quicksilver</hi> is found sometimes, but that rarely and in small quantities; I remember once out of a Lead-Mine I saw about a Pound of <hi>Virgin Quicksilver,</hi> but never any native <hi>Cinnaber</hi> in these Parts, which is its usual Ore. <hi>Black Lead</hi> we have near <hi>Keswick,</hi> which might be got in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61347:63"/>
great quantities, but the Mines are open'd only once in seven Years, that being engrossed by the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and by them made use of in glazing Earthen Ware, and in making their Melting-pots, but I presume they make a farther Use of it, in mixing it with Metals, which is not yet communicated to us; but by mixing this with <hi>Red-Lead,</hi> I have seen it run upon an Earth near <hi>Haigh,</hi> a Glass scarce discernible from <hi>Tortoise.</hi> The <hi>Lapis Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris</hi> is sometimes found in the Copper Mines, and made use of in converting Copper into Brass, and is likewise us'd in the Dysentery, which being a strong Alcaly, by imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Acid, may be a Specific in that Distemper. I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now accounted for the most remarkable Phaenomena in <hi>Metals</hi> and <hi>Metallis affinia,</hi> I shall in the next place, according to my intended Method, proceed to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Vegetables</hi> remarkable in these Countries, and their various Operations.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of <hi>Plants,</hi> the various Species of Marine, Amphibious, Sea <hi>Plants,</hi> and their Vegetations illustrated; of <hi>Plants</hi> peculiar to the Counties; of the Physical and Poysonous <hi>Plants,</hi> with a <hi>Rationale</hi> of their Effects; Fossile <hi>Plants</hi> examined, and demonstrated from various Observations, that they are but <hi>Lusus Naturae.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Learned and Indefatigable Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> has discours'd with that accuracy and fullness of these, that there is little room left to enlarge upon this Subject; wherefore what I shall offer in this Chapter shall be chiefly about their Germination, and some particular Phaenomena which I have observ'd in some of them. Their Virtues and Classes being before by that incomparable Man so fully explain'd, that to touch upon those wou'd be but to Copy him, and wou'd be indeed superfluous.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:61347:64"/>
In some of the <hi>Alga's</hi> or <hi>Sea-Oaks</hi> I have observ'd various <hi>Capsulae</hi> impleted with a pellucid Gelly, and in those an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Number of globular Grains, which I cannot imagin but to be their Seed; wherefore it seems probable to me, that when those <hi>Capsulae</hi> are come to their full Maturity, as in those of a <hi>foetus,</hi> there is a Disruption of their Membranes, then that chrystalline Humour, (so I call it because it so nearly resembles that of the Eye) with the Seeds is excluded; the Tast of it is a little Mucilaginous and somewhat Saline, which Phaenomena demonstrate it to be a proper ferment to propagate the Germination of those Plants: I am far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirm'd in this Opinion, because upon the Rocks where these Plants grow, I have frequently seen this kind of chrystalline Humour, and out of that, various kinds of <hi>Alga's</hi> or <hi>Sea-Oaks</hi> germinating, first sprouting with two small Leaves, and afterwards successively form'd into the whole figure of the Plant. What therefore the ancient Botanists, and some of our modern Ones have alledged of these, asserting them to be amphibious Plants, only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced without Seed, if we fully consider the above-recited Phaenomena I think may fairly be judg'd an Error. I can only speak experimentally as to the <hi>Alga,</hi> but for the Seeds of the <hi>Corals, Corallines, Mosses, Spunges, Alcyoneas,</hi> I will not be obliged so strictly to account for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coralline</hi> we have in these parts in great quantities, and it is almost noted to any vulgar Eye for its eminent Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in killing Worms; and I think it may be prefer'd to any other Alcaly, it being a composition of marine and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calious Particles, and by that means answering two Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and by reason of its safeness, in giving of which there can be no mistake in the Dose, it may challenge a greater Fame than <hi>Mercurius Dulcis,</hi> which by being given either in too great a quantity, or not being rightly sublimed, has sometimes produced most dismal Effects; wherefore the Person who meddles with this ought to know the right Dose for the Years, and particular Constitution of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61347:64"/>
and likewise be rightly satisfy'd that the Medicine is true, for I am certain no one Remedy is so commonly adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; so that he who prescribes it, not only runs the risk of his Reputation, but hazards likewise the Life of his Patient: by mistaking this I saw Two Persons Poison'd beyond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; which Instance I think may sufficiently caution us when, and how to prescribe it, and that Ladies, Nurses, and Apothecaries, and wise Women, who are not compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges whether it is rightly, or not rightly prepared, may not hereafter attempt to give it so liberally as they have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spunges</hi> we frequently find thrown upon the Shores, but I do not remember that I ever saw them growing. <hi>Corals</hi> we have not any, but <hi>Mosses</hi> and <hi>Alcyonia</hi> of various sorts. The <hi>Alga Saccarifera</hi> is frequently found upon these Coasts, and by hanging in the Air it will yield repeated Efflore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scences of a white Sugar, as sweet as any prepar'd from the Sugar-Canes; it is not for the present of any known use, but perhaps by Experiments which may easily be made upon it, succeeding Ages may farther inform us; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I can only add this, that the quantity of Sugar that may be had from one of these <hi>Alga</hi>'s is very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. There are other kinds of <hi>Alga</hi>'s which the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants commonly call <hi>Mermaids Purses,</hi> of these there are Two sorts, the Black and the Yellow: I do not remember any One to have given an account of these, nor can I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my self to what Species they belong, having never yet seen them growing, and I only found them scatter'd on the Sea-shores. The <hi>Sea-Grapes</hi> may likewise be observ'd on these Coasts; and these I think are the most remarkable of Amphibious Plants in these parts.</p>
               <p>The perfect Marine Plants are not very numerous, but the following are common enough, <hi>Eringo, Soldanella, Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn, Plantain, Sea-Colewort, Spurge, Squills, Sea-Purslain, Sedum Minimum, Sea-Spurge, Thrift Marsh-Pinks, Rock Samphire, Marsh Samphire, Horned Poppy Flore Luteo,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61347:65"/>
Sea-Scurvy-grass, Serpillum, Carduus Mariae, Verbena, Rocket, Absinthium Abrotani Folio,</hi> or <hi>Sea-Wormwood.</hi> The <hi>Eringo</hi> is of frequent use in Scorbutic and Consumptive cases, and makes a most pleasant Ale by infusion. <hi>Solda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella</hi> is commonly used in Hydropic Cases, and often with success; nor have I observ'd it to be so rough an Hydragogue as some Botanists have pretended. <hi>Squills</hi> that grow here are not used, but I see no reason why they may not answer all the ends of the other. <hi>Serpillum</hi> is a Plant often success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made use of in Catarrhs, and in the <hi>Fluor Albus. Rock Samphire</hi> makes a most delicate Pickle, and may be ranged in the first Class amongst Anti-scorbuticks. <hi>Sea-Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> is a Plant of extraordinary Virtues, yielding an Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Oyl, a volatile and fixed Salt, and is of great use in Hysteric, Hypocondriac, and Hydropic Cases. <hi>Carduus Mariae</hi> in Pleuritic Cases may be styl'd amongst the first; and no doubt but the Juice of it taken in inflammatory Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers may be of great use. <hi>Marsh Samphire</hi> has a Tast perfectly Saline, makes an agreeable Pickle, and doubtless helps Digestion. These Plants may be counted Specifics for the Distempers incident to those Coasts, which if duly consider'd, give us pregnant reason to admire the Goodness of Him that made them. The amphibious Plants are not of use in Physick, but their Ashes are serviceable to Glass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, and spread upon Ground make very good Tillage. Some have pretended that in dulcifying Sea-Water these have been made use of; and it may be the Mucilage of these Plants may bridle the Sulphureous part of the Salt, which makes the Water unhealthful, but however this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod can never be serviceable at Sea, nor is there any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity for it.</p>
               <p>Having now dispatch'd the amphibious and perfect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Plants, I shall in the next place proceed to the Inland Plants of these Countries; but shall not give an account of each particular Plant, but only of those that are esteem'd rare. The <hi>Vaccinia Nubis,</hi> or <hi>Cloud-berries,</hi> are found upon
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61347:65"/>
                  <hi>Pendle-Hill</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> a Fruit of a pleasant Tast, and a good Anti-scorbutic. The <hi>Lilly of the Valley</hi> is in many of our Woods, and is a noted Sternutatory. <hi>Herba Paris</hi> is in many places, and is an eminent Counter-poyson. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drosaemum</hi> grows frequently about our <hi>Mosses,</hi> a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Balsamic and Vulnerary. <hi>Nummularia</hi> grows in many of our <hi>Mosses,</hi> a Balsamic. <hi>Ros Solis</hi> is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, carries a pellucid Mucilage, in which I presume con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist its Vertues in Atrophies; and no doubt were these fully enquired into, they might give reason to enlarge farther upon its Qualities, for where there is a necessity to bridle an Acid, as there is in most chronic and acute Distempers, this may doubtless be a proper Vehicle to entangle those Salts; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides which it yields a volatile Oyl and Salt, which suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently correct Acids. The <hi>Services</hi> we have growing in great quantities upon the Rocks near <hi>Rougham,</hi> which yield a delicious Acid. The <hi>Dwarf Cynorhoidon</hi> grows in great plenty, the Conserve of its Fruit is a good Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scorbutic, and of great use in Consumptive cases. <hi>Scolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendrium</hi> grows frequently upon the Rocks. <hi>Ophioglossum</hi> or <hi>Adder's-Tongue</hi> grows near some of our Meers, as <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin-Meer. Calamus Aromaticus</hi> grows in several places: as <hi>Osmund Royal</hi> frequently upon the Morasses, the Root of which is of great use in the Worms, Rickets, and Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and I think I may aver that I was the first that in that Case prescribed it. <hi>Virga Aurea</hi> grows upon the Sea Coasts in <hi>Furness.</hi> A particular kind of <hi>Scurvy-grass</hi> grows upon the Rocks near <hi>Castleton</hi> in <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> more acrid and pungent than any I have observ'd, and has a small Leaf, exactly resembling that call'd the <hi>Danish Scurvy-grass.</hi> The fresh Water Plants in these parts are common with most others, therefore I shall not insist upon them. <hi>Lunaria</hi> is in some places, but very rare; <hi>Origanum</hi> is common, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Sage</hi> and <hi>Buckbane</hi> are likewise so; and I think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Vegetables they may be esteem'd Two of the best Anti-scorbutics, either in infusion or decoction. <hi>Rocamboes</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:61347:66"/>
grow in the Meadows near <hi>Preston,</hi> and make an agreeable Sawce. The Dutch <hi>Myrtle</hi> or <hi>Gale</hi> is common upon the Mosses. <hi>Erica</hi> or <hi>Cypress-Heath</hi> is common in these parts, and of great use in Hydropic cases. <hi>Telephium</hi> is in plenty, and useful in curing the Piles. We have the <hi>Filipendula Aquatica,</hi> as likewise <hi>Solanum Lethale, Sphondylium, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oscyamos,</hi> and other Herbs of poysonous qualities. The <hi>Viscus Corilinus</hi> is common, but I have not observ'd the <hi>Quercinus,</hi> but either of them will answer in the Cases di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for: These by the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> are supposed to Vegetate from a Seed devour'd by some Birds, which in their Bowels receives a Fermentation, and by a Mucus which is injected with it adheres to the Tree, and so by the imbib'd ferment begins its Germination.</p>
               <p>An Instance not much unlike this <hi>Tavernier</hi> gives us of the growing of Nutmegs in <hi>East-India,</hi> which he affirms are swallow'd by the Birds of Paradise, which by intoxicating them, urge them to vomit them up again; then by a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which adheres to the Nutmegs, ejected from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs of the Birds, they begin to germinate, and cannot any otherwise be propagated: But this by some is looked upon only as a Stratagem of the Dutch to keep the world in Ignorance, they having engross'd all the Nutmeg-Islands; and to divert others from attempting the planting of them. <hi>Tavernier</hi> is positive in the Instance, so that what he lays down whether true or not I shall not pretend to determine; but if it be so, it fairly illustrates the other Instance.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lady-slipper</hi> we have in several of our Woods, and the <hi>Geranium Robertianum,</hi> which is of extraordinary use in scrophulous Cases, either in Powder or Decoction. <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula foetida</hi> grows in some parts, but very rare. <hi>Lamium album</hi> grows in several places, and is a good Anti-strumatic. <hi>Dulcamara</hi> grows very common, and is an Anti-scorbutic, good in the Jaundice and Dropsies; the Bark of it is used, and that in infusion. Upon the Draining of <hi>Martin-Meer</hi> several unusual Plants were observable, never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61347:66"/>
seen in these Parts, particularly a kind of Grass which grows to a prodigious length, and is as sweet as <hi>Liquorice;</hi> this in a very short time fattens <hi>Sheep</hi> and other Cattle, and makes them very delicious Food, but then they must be slaughter'd out of it when thorowly fatten'd, otherwise they are apt to grow rotten and dye: Which Distemper (by what I can observe in the Dissection of those Creatures) is nothing but an <hi>Anasarca,</hi> or Dropsy of the whole Body; and in these we have the fairest opportunity of discovering the Lymphatic Vessels, which if thorowly known both as to their Uses and Rise, would bring Matters in <hi>Physick</hi> very near to a Demonstration, and in Hydropic Cases might save the Lives of several Persons, by having a clear Idea of the Cause of that Distemper in those Creatures. <hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simum</hi> we have in these Parts, and it is of use in Asthma's, Consumptions and Dropsies. <hi>Feverfew</hi> grows common, a noted Anticsteric and Diuretic. <hi>White Hoare-hound</hi> likewise, and is an excellent Pectoral. <hi>Scabios</hi> is plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and <hi>Tragopogon</hi> or <hi>Goats-beard,</hi> of great use in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive Cases. <hi>Centaury</hi> and <hi>Celandine</hi> are very common, and are used in the Jaundice and Intermitting Distempers. <hi>Asarum</hi> grows in several places, and likewise <hi>Arum</hi> or <hi>Wake Robin,</hi> its Water is an Antiscorbutick, and the Roots are used in Distempers of the Stomach, and the <hi>Pica Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginis. Enula Campana</hi> is very common, as likewise <hi>Bistort, Echiums,</hi> and <hi>Buglosses;</hi> we have both the <hi>Hispidum</hi> and <hi>Glabrum,</hi> and <hi>Hieracia</hi> of several sorts, particularly the <hi>Lactescens,</hi> which deserves our strict Enquiry into its Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, of which the <hi>Botanists</hi> have not taken notice. <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Plantain</hi> grows common, and is much used in Arthritic Cases; we have likewise the <hi>Plantago Rotundi-folio;</hi> other <hi>Plantains</hi> are common, which in the Autumnal Season are apt to collect a white Powder from the Air, about which time Intermitting Distempers are generally Epidemical: This Powder has no peculiar Taste, I have given it to <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Cats,</hi> but never found any Effects from it. <hi>Ebulum</hi> or

                  <hi>Dwarf-Elder</hi> grows in several places, and is of great use in Hydropic Cases. There are several other <hi>Plants</hi> in these Counties, but these being the most remarkable for their Vertues in <hi>Physick,</hi> I have only given an Account of them for the benefit of the Inhabitants of these parts, the other are already describ'd at large by the incomparable Dr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> Dr. <hi>Plackenet,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sloane,</hi> Dr. <hi>Robinson,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dale;</hi> wherefore for a full and entire satisfaction in those Matters, to those eminent and learn'd Authors refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>fossile Plants,</hi> Dr. <hi>Woodward</hi> in his Essay towards an universal <hi>Natural History,</hi> seems not to give a more probable Conjecture of a total dissolution of the <hi>Strata</hi> of the Earth at the universal Deluge, than by the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he has made upon <hi>Plants</hi> discover'd in Rocks: But since this Hypothesis labours under so many unanswerable Difficulties, I cannot till more pregnant Proofs are produc'd, adhere to it; nor can we reasonably suppose a dissolution of the <hi>Strata</hi> of the Earth, and yet conceive these to be kept entire: That very Instance in Coal-Mines is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration against it. To these I shall add another Instance, I have now by me of a stony Substance of the exact resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and magnitude of a <hi>Cockle-shell,</hi> found many Yards in Stone, yet much lighter than any <hi>Cockle-shell</hi> of the same bigness; which could never be perform'd by specifick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, as the Dr. alledges. In the next place to imagin a dissolution of most solid Rocks, and Bodies of more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate substance, this surely must be effected by some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <hi>Menstruum,</hi> distinct from Water; and why then in the Name of common Reason should not Plants run the same risque? That <hi>Menstruum</hi> that could make so severe an Impression, and disunite those compact Bodies, would certainly have easily reduc'd Plants to ruin. That there was a Disruption of the <hi>Strata</hi> of the Earth, is but reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to allow, and likewise that various Bodies floated in that general Inundation; but that these Plants are any
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61347:67"/>
Argument for a Dissolution, or that they were the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of the Deluge, is in the next place to be consider'd. In the Rocks in these Parts are only found <hi>Polypody, Wall-Rue, Scolopendrium,</hi> or Leaves of Thorns; doubtless other Plants as well as these would have occur'd to our Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had these been deposited here by <hi>Noah</hi>'s Deluge. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, these Leaves are never found doubled, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in so dismal a Confusion as the Deluge was, would have happen'd had they here been deposited in that general Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastrophe. My Sentiment of the whole is this, (That as it is observable in Chymistry that the Salts of some Plants will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate themselves into the figure of the Plants) that these representations of Plants in Rocks are nothing but diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Concretions of saline, bituminous and terrene Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and I am farther confirm'd in this Hypothesis, since they, as well as the <hi>Capsulae</hi> they are found in, seldom fail to afford us that mixture. Various Specimens we have of these in Rocks in these Counties, in one particularly near <hi>Ormskirk</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> in which <hi>Scolopendrium</hi> may be seen exactly delineated: This was communicated to me by Mr. <hi>William Barton</hi> Apothecary in that Town, and is as I remember in some Rocks near <hi>Latham,</hi> belonging to the R<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Hon<hi rend="sup">ble</hi> 
                  <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> to whom I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely oblig'd for the Honour done me, in having had the Honour to be frequently Physician to his Lordship, and to that unparallel'd Youth, his Son, the R<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Hon<hi rend="sup">ble</hi> 
                  <hi>Iames</hi> L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>Strange.</hi> There are other Rocks in which may be observ'd Leaves of Thorns, as in some Rocks near <hi>Heesham,</hi> and in the Coal-Pits near <hi>Burnley</hi> in <hi>Lancashire.</hi> These are all the reputed Plants that I have found remarkable in these Parts.</p>
               <p>Having now fairly illustrated it to be highly improbable, that these Plants shou'd be the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of the Deluge, but rather Concretions of Matter, or the Disports of Nature, it may perhaps be expected by some, that I shou'd give an account of the different Opinions concerning the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality of the Deluge, as well in respect of the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61347:68"/>
Globe, as of the total Destruction of all its Inhabitants. I shall therefore give you a Scheme of the most principal amongst them: The first is of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who extend the Universality of the Deluge, not only to all the Terrestrial Creatures, but the Fish they say, were suffocated by the Heat of the Rains, and Waters which broke out of the deep Fountains of the Earth. There are others also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Jews, who deny this Universality of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, not only to all terrestrial Creatures, but pretend that besides the Eight Persons included in the Ark, <hi>Og</hi> the King of <hi>Basan</hi> was preserv'd. But to these I reply, that whoever considers those prodigious Mountains of marine Shells, in <hi>Ireland, Virginia,</hi> the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-Indies,</hi> cannot but conclude that they were deposited there by the Deluge; and then considering the height of the Mountains, and the vast remoteness of the Places, one from another, that the Deluge must be Universal also: But this particular is fully discours'd of in a preceding Chapter. The third Opinion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to a Deluge is that of the <hi>Scholasticks,</hi> who are of Opinion that <hi>Enoch,</hi> who they say at that time liv'd in Paradise, was not involv'd in the Deluge: But since the holy Writ is silent in that matter, and that neither the <hi>Aegyptian, Chaldee, Hebrew,</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> Versions of the Old Testament take any notice of that Opinion, I cannot but conclude it erroneous and unwarrantable. There was a fourth Opinion of the Jews, who maintain, that not only a few Persons, but whole Nations never felt the Effects of this great Inundation, but that the Jews only, and other Inhabitants in <hi>Palestine</hi> perish'd in it; but what has been said in answer to the preceding Opinion may serve for this. There was a fifth Rank, who affirm'd that there was a total Destruction of Mankind at the Deluge, yet so as that the whole Terrestrial Globe was not overwhelm'd by the Waters; which Opinion is founded on two other Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses, <hi>viz.</hi> That at the time of the Flood the Earth remain'd for the greatest part desolate and without Inhabitants,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61347:68"/>
and that all the Waters in the Universe were not sufficient to cause so general a Deluge: <hi>Abraham Mylius</hi> pretends to demonstrate, that if all the Waters of the Universe had been sent down upon the Earth, they could not have cover'd the tops of the highest Mountains. <hi>Isaac Vossius</hi> approves of both these Hypotheses, but since from the vast Beds of marine Shells even upon the tops of the highest Mountains, it is undeniably evident that the highest Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were cover'd; it thence follows that the Deluge must be universal, and that <hi>Mylius</hi> and <hi>Vossius</hi> are both mistaken. The sixth and last are those that have chosen the truest O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and maintain that the Deluge was universal, both in respect to the Terrestrial Globe, and its Inhabitants; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Motive that induc'd God was universal; God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains that the <hi>Imaginations of mens hearts</hi> were <hi>only evil continually;</hi> his Threats likewise were universal, <hi>I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and every creeping thing, and the fowls of the air, for it repenteth me that I have made them.</hi> Hence therefore it is evident from the holy Scriptures, and from the Phaenomena in <hi>Natural History,</hi> that there was a Deluge, and that this Deluge was universal too; wherefore I cannot but admire that the great St. <hi>Austin</hi> should be so far mistaken, as to affirm that there were not the least foot-steps of the Deluge, either in the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> Writers, since the contrary is so clearly demonstrated by <hi>Hugo Grotius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall now in the last place lay down some Hypotheses concerning the Qualities in <hi>Plants,</hi> and so close this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by drawing a Parallel betwixt Chymical Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Qualities in Physical Herbs, endeavour to give a <hi>Rationale</hi> of their Effects. But this having in a great measure been attempted by <hi>Pechlinius, Wedelius,</hi> Sr. <hi>Iohn Floyer,</hi> and others, I shall but briefly treat upon that Head, and that in the following Method: First, By giving an account of <hi>Emetics,</hi> and the <hi>Rationale</hi> of their Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; afterwards of Cathartic or Purgative <hi>Plants,</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scorbutics,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61347:69"/>
Balsamics, Diuretics, Antistrumatics, Stoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chics, Cardiacs, Anti-hydropics, Anticterics, Antepilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, Restringents, Opiates, Paragorics, Alexipharmacs. The Emetic Plants are only two, <hi>Squills</hi> and <hi>Asarum,</hi> and both are of a bitter and nauseous Tast: first therefore we shall enquire into the Cause of the Bitterness in these, and then how that becomes Emetical. Bitterness consists in rigid, pungent and inflexible Particles, pointed upon terrene ones; hence the Points, by their continual Irritations, contract the Fibres of the Stomach, and still pressing it by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexibility, at length they throw it into Convulsions, and so become Emetical, or Vomiting: Thus we see in a solution of Silver in Spirit of <hi>Nitre</hi> that the Points of the corroding Spirit being sheathed in the metallic Particles, it not only becomes extremely bitter, but likewise Emetical; the like may be observ'd by pouring Spirit of <hi>Nitre</hi> upon the <hi>Lapis Calaminaris:</hi> and doubtless thus it is that the Leaves of <hi>Asarum</hi> are so famous an Errhine, and of so great use in inveterate Head-achs, <hi>viz.</hi> Their acrid saline Particles continually pressing the Glands of the Nostrils, force them to discharge that acrid <hi>Serum,</hi> which occasions that Distemper.</p>
               <p>The most noted Cathartics are <hi>Buckthorn, Monks Rhubarb, Elder, Damask Roses, Iris, Soldanella, Spurge, Mezereon. Buckthorn</hi> is extremely bitter, and affords an Oyl and a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Spirit, neither of which are bitter, or in the least Purgative; whence it seems evident to me, that its bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Purging quality consist in its saline Particles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strictly united with terrene ones, and so by that means contracting the Fibres of the Bowels, they become purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. <hi>Roses, Iris,</hi> and the rest are likewise bitter, but they all differ in their Pungency. <hi>Mezereon, Spurge</hi> and <hi>Iris</hi> are both Emetic and Cathartic, which sometimes not only cauterize the Coates of the Stomach, but the Skin it self, if externally apply'd: No doubt but by due Corrections these might be made most noble Medicines, and the likeliest
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61347:69"/>
Method to effect this (as far as I can conjecture) would be by obtunding their saline Particles by the <hi>Lapis Calamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> or some such Alcaly; or if their Vertues consist in an acrid Alcaly, a proper Acid might be thought on; and I think it would be highly worth our while to make strict Enquiries into these Matters, that being the likeliest Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to bring us to a Certainty in the Practice of <hi>Physick.</hi> Before I close this Head I shall only offer two Experiments, and then proceed: The first is concerning <hi>Aloes,</hi> which by being infus'd in Spirit of Wine loses its Purgative quality, but yet retains its Bitterness; the second is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a solution of <hi>Aloes,</hi> which being injected into the Veins of a <hi>Dog,</hi> will inevitably purge him: From which Observations naturally arises this Question, Whether Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartics effect their ends in the first passages, or by working Elective in the Mass of Blood, as the Physicians stile it? I affirm the former, and to the first Experiment make this reply; The volatile, acrid, saline Particles in the <hi>Aloes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dissolv'd by the Spirit of Wine, it must of necessity (for the Reasons before alledg'd) be depriv'd of its purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive quality, yet so as still to retain its Bitterness, because it is probable some saline Particles are so inveloped with the oily and terrene ones, that a separation is not easily made, perhaps not without Distillation or Calcination; so that the <hi>Aloes</hi> in some measure may retain its Bitterness, yet be depriv'd of its purging quality. To the second I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thus, A solution of <hi>Aloes</hi> being injected into the Mass of Blood, it is most probable its Particles are again sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Blood, by the conglomerate Glands of the Bowels; it is not therefore that they work Elective in the Mass of Blood, but by their contracting of the Bowels upon their separation: for it is undeniably evident, that several Purges will operate before they could possibly be suppos'd to have mixt with the Mass of Blood.</p>
               <p>In the next place Anti-scorbutics may be said to be either Bitters, Acrids, or Nitrous <hi>Plants:</hi> The Bitters are <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathum</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:61347:70"/>
                  <hi>acutum, Mountain-sage</hi> and <hi>Water-Trefoil,</hi> and these all afford an Oyl, and acid Spirit, and a fixt alcalious Salt, but the Salt in the greatest proportion, next to that the Oyl, and then the Spirit; hence it is that these Herbs, by their saline and oily Particles attenuating the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood, coagulated by its Acids, restore it to its due Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and are for that reason of great use in Anti-scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butic Cases. The Acrids are the <hi>Cresses, Asarum, Scurvy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grass,</hi> and <hi>Radishes,</hi> and do all of them afford Oyls, and volatile alcalious Salts, wherefore for the Reasons before alledg'd they may properly be stiled Anti-scorbutics. The Nitrous are the <hi>Aparine, Vetches, Ground-Ivy</hi> and <hi>Nettles,</hi> these all yield a volatile, nitrous, essential Salt, as may be seen in the freezing of their depurated Juices; and hence it is that by tempering and diluting the bilious Particles in the Blood, they allay those Scorbutic heats, and are of great use in violent Bleeding, particularly <hi>Ground-Ivy,</hi> which by its saline Particles, not only deterses and quits the Breast from an oppressive Phlegm, but likewise by its Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samics, consolidates. Balsamics do all of them afford tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binthinate Oyls, and the chief amongst these are St. <hi>Iohn's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Herb Robert, Tutsal</hi> and <hi>Pennywort.</hi> Diuretics are generally Anti-scorbutics, and those being treated of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I shall not enlarge farther on that Head. Cardiacs are either mild Acids that temper too volatile a Bile, which continually irritates the Spirits, as in several <hi>Fevers,</hi> and of this sort are <hi>Wood-sorrel, Berberries, Rasberries,</hi> and the like: or those that yield volatile Aromatic Oyls, and so disentangle the Spirits, strugling in a Viscid <hi>Serum,</hi> and of this sort are <hi>Butter-bur, Angelico, Eringo, Balm,</hi> and the like. Antistrumatics are <hi>Whitlow-grass, Herb Robert, stinking Gladdon,</hi> and <hi>Dropwort,</hi> and no doubt but they effect their Ends by terebinthinate Particles, since most of them emit <hi>Effluvia</hi> of that Nature, which doubtless cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Acid, that make the Gland scrophulous, by coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating the <hi>Lympha,</hi> as may be observ'd in scrophulous
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61347:70"/>
Glands. Anti-hydropics, as Alteratives, are in the Class of Anti-scorbutics. Stomachics for the most part being Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I shall not enlarge further on them. Anticterics consist of volatile acrid Particles, which attenuate a foeculent Bile, and the chief of these are <hi>Celandine, Pilewort,</hi> and <hi>Madder.</hi> Pectorals are <hi>Maiden-hairs, Ferns,</hi> and Bitters, the two first are Nitrous. <hi>Opiates</hi> and <hi>Paregorics</hi> are the white and red <hi>Poppies,</hi> and <hi>Cowslips,</hi> but how these bridle the impetuous Tumults of the Spirits shall be accounted for in its proper place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poeony</hi> &amp; <hi>Misleto</hi> are Antepileptics, and I am apt to think that it is by a Mucilage, which contains a volatile alcali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Salt,</hi> that they are of use in that Case, <hi>(viz.)</hi> by the innate Heat of the Stomach and Bowels the <hi>Salt</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limes from the Mucilage, and is there immediately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed by the Extremities of the Nerves; and hence they become of use in Convulsive Cases; whereas other volatile <hi>Salts</hi> are spent before they can reach the Nerves. Restrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents are all of them either of a mucilaginous or austere Taste, as <hi>Comfry, Horse-tail, Sloes,</hi> &amp;c. The one by sheathing the Acid, which makes a Disruption of the Vessels, and the other by austere vitriolic Particles pursuing them up, no doubt, effect their Ends.</p>
               <p>The poysonous Plants, it is plain, consist sometimes of saline, corroding, acrimonious Particles, such as inflame, and sometimes sphacelate the Stomach, and contract the Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the <hi>Par vagum,</hi> and then produce <hi>Tremors</hi> and <hi>Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> as is evident in the Dissection of those Creatures that have been poyson'd with these Herbs: Of this sort are the <hi>Cicuta aquatica, Ranunculus flammeus, Solanum lethale, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conitum hyemale,</hi> &amp;c. Some poysonous Plants are of a <hi>Narcotic</hi> Quality, as <hi>Poppy</hi> and <hi>Henbane,</hi> these are of a bitter Taste, and no doubt contain a volatile acrid <hi>Salt,</hi> which by fixing its points upon the <hi>Fibrillae</hi> of the Brain, and the Extremities of the Nerves occasions a Corrugation in them, and by that means hinders a Separation of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61347:71"/>
animal Spirits from the Mass of Blood, and consequently their Dispensation into the various parts of the Body: Hence they being taken in too great a quantity become poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous: <hi>Lettice</hi> likewise, <hi>Melons</hi> and <hi>Cucumbers,</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a mucilaginous Water, doubtless entangle the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, and hinder their Expansion; hence by being too liberally taken, the whole Oeconomy of the Body is disorder'd, the Spirits receding like the Sun-beams, which being screen'd by thick interposing Clouds leave all in Darkness.</p>

                  <p>HAving compleated my Hypothesis concerning the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation of <hi>Sea-Plants,</hi> I shall in the next place propose some Conjectures about the Vegetation of <hi>River</hi> and <hi>Land-Plants,</hi> and give an account of the Experiments on all sides, and add some Trials, which I proved my self, and amongst the rest offer my own Sentiments. The most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Hypotheses relating to this Topic are reduc'd to Two, the one asserting that Vegetation is from Earth, the other from Water only; A Suffragan to the latter is the L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                     <hi>Bacon, Nat. Hist.</hi> Cent. 5. Par. 411. Where he asserts, <q>That for Nourishment of Vegetables Water is all in all, that the Earth only keeps the Plant upright, and guards it from too great Heat or Cold.</q> Others in this Hypothesis are more positive, as the Hon<hi rend="sup">ble</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle, Helmont,</hi> and his Followers; these back their Assertions with the two sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent Experiments, the first is that concerning <hi>Mint,</hi> and several other Plants, which prosper and thrive greatly in Water; the other which you have in the <hi>Sceptical Chymist,</hi> writ by Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> is as follows: <q>Take a certain quantity of Earth, bake it in an Oven, then weigh it, and having included it in an Earthen Pot well water'd, make choice of some fit Plant, as a <hi>Pompion,</hi> which being first carefully weigh'd and set in it, there let it grow, continuing to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61347:71"/>
water it till it is much advanced in Bigness; then take it up, and tho' the Bulk and Weight of the Plant be much greater than at first, yet the Earth will be found little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diminished in Weight; therefore it may be concluded that it is not the Earth, but Water that Nourishes, and is converted into the Substance of the Plant.</q> Thus far like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise proceeds the ingenious Dr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> but had the Dr. given us a full account of his Sentiments on those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, he might likewise have observed that they not only took Plants, and put them in the Earth prepared as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites it, but likewise the Seeds of <hi>Cucumbers</hi> and <hi>Pompions,</hi> which acquired their due Magnitude, and yet the Earth was not diminished in Weight; these Experiments indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the minuteness of the Seeds of those Fruits, with the largeness of their Size when grown to perfection, and yet no decrease of the Earth, might give them very pregnant Reasons for their Conjectures, but these I shall examine in their place. The other Hypothesis is that of the Ancients, which Dr. <hi>Woodward</hi> asserts, for the confirmation of which the Dr. has offer'd the following Experiments.</p>

with terrestrial Matter adhereing to them, the Water was pretty thick, had many and numerous terrestrial Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles swimming in it, and some Sediment at the bottom of the Glass, this Glass had none of the green Matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovemention'd in it; the residue of the Water remaining in the Still was very turbid, high colour'd and reddish, like ordinary Beer; the <hi>Mint</hi> weighed when put into this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 31 Gr. Water expended 4344 Gr. This Plant was very lively, and had sent out six collateral Branches, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Roots. I took <hi>Hyde-Park</hi> Conduit Water, in which was dissolv'd a Dram of <hi>Nitre,</hi> the <hi>Mint</hi> set in this sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly began to wither and decay, and died in a few days, as likewise did two more Sprigs that were set in it succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively. In another Glass I dissolv'd an Ounce of Garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mould, and a Dram of <hi>Nitre,</hi> and in a third half an Ounce of Wood-Ashes and a Dram of <hi>Nitre,</hi> but the Plants in these succeeded no better than in the former. In other Glasses were dissolv'd several sorts of Earths, Clays, Marles, and variety of Manures; <hi>Mint</hi> was set in distill'd Waters, and other Experiments I made of several kinds, in order to get Light and Information, what hastned or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded, what promoted and impeded Vegetation, but these do not belong to the Head that I am now upon. In <hi>Hyde-Park</hi> Conduit Water I fix'd a glass Tube about 10 Inches long, the Bore about one sixth of an Inch in diameter, fill'd with very fine and white Sand, which I kept from falling down out of the Tube into the Vial, by tying a thin piece of Silk over that end of the Tube which was downwards, upon the Immersion of the lower end of it the Water by little and little ascended to the upper O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice of the Tube, and yet in all the 56 Days it stood thus, a very inconsiderable quantity of Water had gone off, <hi>viz.</hi> scarce 20 Grains, tho' the Sand continued moist to the very top to the last; the Water imparted a green Tincture to the Sand quite to the top of the Tube, and in the Vial it had precipitated a greenish Sediment mix'd with black,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61347:73"/>
to the bottom and sides of the Tube, as far as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd in Water, adher'd pretty much of the green Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance describ'd above.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From these Experiments the Dr. draws these Corollaries, That Earth, and not Water, is the Matter that constitutes Vegetables, that Improvements by Nitrons, and Alcali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zates, are only by the saline Particles attenuating the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones, and preparing them to be carried up by the Water, and dispos'd of into the substance of the Plant; that Water serves only as a Vehicle to the terrestrial Matter which forms Vegetables, and does not it self make any addition to them.</p>
                  <p>Now, if I mistake not, if we must make Earth a meer simple Body, and that to be the Matter only that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into the substance of the Plant, this Hypothesis will labour under more Difficulties than the former, if (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Doctor's Notion) the saline Particles contribute no farther than in preparing this Mould; for we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly assure our selves, that the <hi>Manchinello</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> that irresistable and deceiving Poyson, must needs consist of more Bodies than Earth alone, otherwise how comes its Fruit to be so fatal, that not only the Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it is present Death, but the very eating of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that have fed upon it produces the same Effect; nay even the drops of Rain that fall from its Leaves are of so poysonous a Nature, as to blister and inflame the Skin: Here doubtless is more than a bare Contexture of Earth, and without question the most corroding, sulphureous and penetrating Particles we can have any Idea of. Besides, were Vegetation from Earth alone, I cannot see how one Plant could be distinguish'd from another; wherefore to me it seems rational to infer, That the Body which the Dr. calls Earth, consists of as many different Bodies as that which the Chymists call Water; so that from either of these two Bodies simply consider'd as such, it is equally absurd to derive Vegetation; but these two Bodies do indisputably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61347:73"/>
of variety of Corpuscles, <hi>e. g.</hi> Saline, Terrene, Aerial, and Bituminous, and as the Vessels in Plants by their vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Orifices and Contextures, admit of different proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of these, so accordingly the Plant is differently mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dify'd, and from their different digestions and proportions receives its Form, Colour, Substance and Virtues. And by this Hypothesis we may account for Plants physical, poysonous, fragrant, foetid, and of other kinds; hence <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop</hi> and <hi>Scamony</hi> a sort of <hi>Spurge</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> by their resinous saline Particles, become purgative, and if taken in too large quantities, poysonous; the same may be affirm'd of <hi>Laureola, Aloes, Spurge, Senna</hi> and <hi>Agaric:</hi> It is manifest from the Dissection of those Creatures to which <hi>Night-shade, Nux Vomica, Calculus Indicus,</hi> and <hi>Water-Hemlock</hi> are given, that the Poysons of these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in acrimonious, saline Particles, corroding and inflaming the Stomach, of which the learned <hi>Wafer</hi> gives us various Instances; others by exalted Sulphurs quit from saline Particles, doubtless become Fragrant, Aromatic and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, being by their size and figure (which we presume to be Spherical) the more readily adapted to assist the animal Spirits by their activity. When these Sulphurs become pointed with Salts, 'tis most likely that the Plant becomes foetid and unpleasant, as the stinking <hi>Garden Orach,</hi> and <hi>Herb Robert:</hi> I might likewise account for the Heat, Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterings, and other qualities of Herbs, but those being in part done before, and not properly within the Verge of this Undertaking, I shall not recapitulate, but to the ingenious Sr. <hi>Iohn Floyer</hi> of <hi>Lichfield</hi> on that Head refer the Curious, in whose Works they may find variety of Experiments on those Subjects.</p>
                  <p>I must confess that the Experiments which Dr. <hi>Woodward</hi> has made relating to Vegetation, are exact as well as learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he having besides the <hi>dispendium</hi> of the Water in so many Days, fully demonstrated the Plant to have gain'd a considerable Weight, which he affirms to have been from
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61347:74"/>
Earth; but then (as I affirm'd before) the question is, what he calls Earth; for if by that he means a pure simple Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> a Body consisting only of one size and figure, then (from what has been hinted before) it is as absurd to deduce Vegetation from that, as from Water. I shall only beg leave to add an Experiment or two, and so conclude: I took the Seeds of <hi>Nymphaea</hi> or <hi>Water-Lilly</hi> when full ripe, and put them in glass Vials, in which they continued twelve Months, I added fresh Water to them as the other evaporated; the Seeds at the bottom of both Vials stood erect, and emitted a pellucid Mucilage, which stood in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite Globules near the upper end of the Seed; the Water deposited a great deal of green and earthy Matter, but the Seed never vegetated or sprouted at all, tho' this be a <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Plant.</hi> From this Experiment it is evident, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Earth and Water barely consider'd as such, other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are necessary to the Vegetation of various <hi>Plants,</hi> and probably to this a fat sulphureous <hi>Ouze,</hi> in which it usually grows, and has Roots of an immense Magnitude, some I have seen as thick as the Thigh of a Man, which were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Pond at <hi>Tabley</hi> in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> when it was drein'd, where the remaining Earth or Mud, which was black and foetid, was wholly over-spread with them. This Instance, I think, may fairly serve to illustrate the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis that I have laid down concerning the Vegetation of <hi>Plants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To these may be added those extraordinary Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made by Chandlers Ashes, consisting of oily and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Particles, as likewise the Impost of <hi>Malpighius,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with an Infusion of <hi>Sheep's</hi> Dung, <hi>Pigeon's</hi> Dung, and a small quantity of <hi>Nitre;</hi> of which I saw an Instance the last Year at <hi>Edgecroft</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> by which from a fourth part of Seed, in the most barren part of the Field, I saw a very luxuriant Crop: It might do well for our Gentry (who inhabit their Country Seats) and Husbandmen thorowly to consider this, since the right application of it
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61347:74"/>
to a proper Soil, may be of so great Advantage; and who knows what this, even in the most cold and barren Ground, may effect, which hitherto for the greatest part hath lain useless; but besides what is here offer'd, their Interest may be a more inciting Argument to induce them to Tryals of this Nature.</p>
                  <p>But can there be had a more ample Demonstration of this Hypothesis, than even from Water and Earth themselves? How common is it to observe Earth, by being long pent up, to emit sulphureous <hi>Effluvia?</hi> Hence we have foetid Smells by opening of Ditches and Sluces, and hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably it is, that in Consumptive cases, from plowed Grounds that have for a considerable time been Pasture, many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have received Benefit, which must assuredly proceed from sulphureous benign Particles loosen'd from their Cells, and convey'd to the Mass of Blood, which by their activity obtund the saline Particles that make the <hi>Coagulum,</hi> and in short prevent the putrifaction, which brings on a <hi>Phthisis</hi> or Consumption. And as to Water, nothing is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, than it to grow nauseously foetid by long keeping, which Phaenomenon sufficiently evinces the Existence of sulphureous Particles in that Element; besides, some sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Waters in four Days by being close stopt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come extremely foetid as St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s at <hi>Buxton</hi> in <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> which expos'd to open Air, alters not at all, nor has the least ungrateful smell: The reason is, because those sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous <hi>Effluvia</hi> which have spent themselves in a free Air, are now forc'd by their confinement, to unite with saline Particles, and thence by their Points grate upon the Organ, and are foetid and offensive.</p>
                  <p>It is likewise to be observ'd, that if these sulphureous Particles are pent up in any Aquaeduct, that then by their Collision upon one another, they become excessive hot; hence it is that the hot Baths at <hi>Aix la Chappel,</hi> in the Bishop of <hi>Leige</hi>'s Country are caused, by retarding the hot Spring with a Stoppel, and in a little time after by
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61347:75"/>
giving it Vent the Waters are render'd very hot, and even too intense to be endur'd. This Instance farther confirms our Hypothesis concerning the Heat in Baths, and by this Phaenomenon it is evident, that if the same Essay was put in practice at <hi>Buxton,</hi> the Bath there might be brought to any degree of Heat, and at the same time likewise they might have temperate Baths to answer the variety of Cases and Constitutions, and by that means acquire an advantage above any Baths yet discover'd. Thus I have made it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent how compounded those Bodies are which we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stile Earth and Water, nor can I see any reason to assign either of them as the principles of Vegetation barely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd as such.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>A Midst all the Mazes and Recesses of Nature, none are more common or more amazing than these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Phaenomena: Near <hi>Chippin</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> 20 Fathom in Lime-stone Rock, I have seen <hi>Cockles, Muscles,</hi> and the <hi>Pectinites,</hi> all of a perfect flinty Substance. In <hi>High-Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in the same County I have observ'd, as to their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearances, the Bones and Fins of Fishes, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Bones of a Gigantic Magnitude, and those of a sparry Substance, which may be reduc'd to the <hi>Fluor Alabastrites;</hi> I have likewise seen the <hi>Glossopetrae</hi> or <hi>Crow-Bills,</hi> and those invested with an hard flinty Film, the Matter contain'd therein being a black hard Stone. Upon these Phaenomena it is that Dr. <hi>Woodward</hi> supposes them to be the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of those Creatures at the Deluge, and deposited in those Rocks by specific Gravitation; for he takes it for granted, that there was a total dissolution of the <hi>Strata</hi> of the Earth, and that the whole Globe was but one continued
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61347:75"/>
Fluid, and that in variety of Temperatures, and in some Balsamic mixtures these Shells, Fins, Fishes and Bones, have been embalm'd ever since that terrible Catastrophe. A Notion (could it be maintain'd) as wonderful for the profound Respect it bears to the Truth of <hi>Moses</hi>'s History of the Deluge, as to Static Philosophy: But since the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge has been before fully demonstrated from other Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena observable in the Earth, and that against this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis there are so many concluding Arguments, I shall in the first place to clear this Head, enquire into the Nature of these Petrifactions, and reduce them to their different Species, and then lay down some Arguments to convince the World, that they are not the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of those Animals.</p>
               <p>As to the Testaceous Petrifactions, they are either the <hi>Cockle, Muscle, Oyster,</hi> or <hi>Pectinites;</hi> the three first are of a Flinty substance, of the <hi>Pectinites</hi> there are two sorts, the one is Flinty, and the other is the <hi>Pyrites Aureus,</hi> or golden Marcasite; I have likewise observ'd in that substance representations of <hi>Fibulae</hi> or Buttons, these may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in the Copper Mines in <hi>High-Furness;</hi> the <hi>Glossope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trae</hi> are found in some Mines in <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> and of those there are three sorts, the one resembling the Bill of a <hi>Crow,</hi> another that of a <hi>Lapwing,</hi> and a third the Bill of a <hi>Perr,</hi> a small Bird very common upon the Sea-Coasts: These were given me by my worthy Friend and Relation <hi>Peter Legh</hi> of <hi>Booths</hi> in the County of <hi>Cheshire,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr>
               </p>
               <p>We therefore come in the next place to lay down some Arguments, why these Bodies could not be the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of Animals at the Deluge; for had these been the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of Fowls, Fishes, and other Creatures, how is it possible but that other Shells, and Beaks of other Fowls, as well as of these, might sometime or other have been discover'd in these Rocks; but since no others are found, it seems pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to me that they are but what I formerly alledg'd, the Disports of Nature. In some Marbles gotten near <hi>Holker</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:61347:76"/>
in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> I have seen the exact shape of a Man, and that in six Inches compass. In some Mines in <hi>Derbyshire</hi> I have seen a Substance bearing exactly the similitude of a Man's Tooth, and that as big as a Child's Head, to which was annex'd an Head which would have contain'd several Measures, and the Limbs proportionable. In <hi>Pools-Hole</hi> there is the resemblance of a <hi>Lyon,</hi> a dead Man, a Chair, and a Flitch of Bacon; yet no Man (I suppose) will assert these to be <hi>Exuviae,</hi> or the Chair one of the Houshold goods of the Antediluvians, no more than the foremention'd Cloak-Buttons the Appendices of their Apparel. In other Mines I have observ'd the resemblances of Skrews, Stars, Feathers, Bones, and Shells, and all in the same <hi>Stratum:</hi> Now, I say, considering all these together, unless we will conclude the rest petrify'd, as well as the Shells, there is no necessity to assert the former, but that they may equally be different Modifications of Matter.</p>
               <p>Once in an Earth that came from <hi>East-India,</hi> I saw the the perfect shape of <hi>Cockles</hi> of several sizes, where there were not the least signs of any Shell, or any Petrifaction at all; it was a brownish soft Earth, and indifferently friable; It was communicated to me by Mr. <hi>Edward Ent,</hi> Son to Sr. <hi>George Ent,</hi> and formerly of <hi>Balliol-</hi>College in <hi>Oxford.</hi> I have feen great variety of Petrifactions, perform'd by the Sea-Water it self, at <hi>Hagy Bar</hi> Hills in <hi>Lancashire:</hi> The Marle there shelves downwards, and several sorts of Pebbles are included in various <hi>Capsulae;</hi> this Marle is converted by the Sea-Water into a firm Grit, or Free-stone, in some pieces of which we find Shells of Sea-Snails embalmed, and those not in the least petrify'd. Consider we then this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction of Earth, and tho' the Shell is often very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute and tender, yet it still retains its Identic Body; I say, if we reflect on this, it is not so easy to imagin (as some conceive) that after the Deluge the Petrifaction of Shells ensued with such facility; for in a multitude of Instances, here the Earth only, not the Shells have undergone that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61347:76"/>
This Marle, I presume, may be petrify'd after this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner, <hi>viz.</hi> Let us allow Marle to be a substance apt to dissolve in Water, it is probable then that the Sea-water by frequently overflowing it, in tract of time makes a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of its Particles, and in their room deposites white gritty Particles, with which even clear Sea-Water much abounds, which is demonstrable in the Evaporation of that Water into a granulated Salt, at which time vast quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Grit are collected in the corners of the Boylers; but the Particles of this Grit are so minute, that till they concrete into <hi>Moleculae,</hi> they are not discoverable either by Microscopes, or by the nicest Filtration: These then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amassed together by the motion of the Sea-Water, are wedg'd and riveted so close, as at last to form a perfect Free-stone; some large Columns there are of these, on which the Country People hang their Wooden Gates, and serve instead of Posts, others seem exactly to resemble Persons standing in old decayed Hats. From which Phaenomena it is demonstrable, that there may be perfect shapes of marine Shells, Bones, Plants, and Beaks of Birds in some Earths, and yet not the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of those Creatures.</p>
               <p>I must confess the most compleat Collection of these (I do believe) in the World is in the Custody of Dr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and could I receive a satisfactory Answer to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments above recited, I would willingly adhere to his Hypothesis; but since they amount to no more than a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, and that those Phaenomena may be otherwise sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and indeed that there are so many convincing Reasons to the contrary, I am forc'd to deviate from an Hypothesis, which I could wish were true: The divine Splendor of such an Undertaking, as well as the irresistible Charms of his Stile, almost commanding an assent to it. 'Tis true, what Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi> has reply'd to the Dr. carries not the air of an Orator and Philosopher, his Language for the most part being grating, particularly those unaccountable Terms of the Miners themselves; but since Truth walks
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61347:77"/>
naked, and needs not the Embellishments of Eloquence to set her forth, I must needs own, that what he relates in his Observations of the lying of the <hi>Strata</hi> in several Mines, is true and exact; and tho' <hi>Dikes, Riders</hi> and <hi>Leaders,</hi> with several other Idioms, may look rather like a piece of Magic than Philosophy, yet surely the things signify'd by these, are observable in all the Mines which I ever yet saw.</p>
               <p>But amidst all the Disports of Nature, there is none more remarkable occurs than that which I saw among the many and choice Curiosities of my Honoured Friend Mr. <hi>Henry Prescot</hi> of <hi>Chester,</hi> Deputy-Register of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Court there. The Figure is as follows: There are six <hi>Calvae,</hi> or Skulls, contain'd in a Shell, with the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of Hats upon them, included one within another, with the Brims cock'd up; on the back-side of the Head are four rhomboidal Figures, an Ellipsis with an Ecliptic Line, and the Parallels upon a Globe, and branching from those the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> and <hi>Medulla Spinalis.</hi> If therefore the Dr. will still pertinaciously affirm that those representations of Plants, Bones and Shells in Rocks, were the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of real ones, deposited there by specific Gravity, and embalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ever since the universal Deluge, he may with the same parity of Reason alledge these to have been the Heads of the Antediluvian <hi>Patriarchs.</hi> From the Phaenomenon laid down we may now without great difficulty account for those representations of Shells, Bones, Fins of Fishes, and Plants, observable in Rocks and Quarreis, and may easily be convinc'd, that to solve these there is no necessity to suppose an universal dissolution of the Globe of the Earth at the Deluge, but indeed are Arguments conclusive to the contrary; wherefore to these I shall only add one general Remark, and so close this Head. Can it be imagin'd that in that general Destruction there should be such a <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum,</hi> or universal Dissolvent in Nature, that should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert all the <hi>Strata</hi> of the Earth, Mines, Minerals and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals into a liquid Form, and yet some few Shells, Bones and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61347:77"/>
Plants remain undissolved, which are of a much softer Texture, and as we find by repeated Experiments, far more easy to be dissolved? He, I say, that can averr this, cannot fairly tax a <hi>Rosicrucian</hi> with <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> nor justly blame the <hi>Adeptist</hi> for his extravagant Notions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the <hi>Alchahest,</hi> that Chymical universal Dissolvent, which he himself does not believe, yet would so far impose upon the World as to have others to do so; but for this the Dr. has promis'd to account in his general History of the World.</p>
               <p>Having now dispatch'd this Point, I shall in the next place proceed to real Shells, Skeletons, and Fins of Fishes, which are sometimes found under Ground, and from those deduce some Corollaries. The subterraneous Skeletons ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable in these Parts are only two, the one an human Body found in the Morasses of the <hi>Meales,</hi> and the other a Skeleton of a <hi>Buck,</hi> found erect in <hi>Ellel</hi> near <hi>Lancaster;</hi> both which being mention'd in a preceding Chapter, I shall not enlarge further upon them.</p>
               <p>As to subterraneous Shells they are frequently found in Marle-Pits, about four Yards deep in solid Marle, and often in places remote from the Sea. These marine Shells are of various sorts, as <hi>Whilkes, Periwincles, Cockles, Muscles, Torculars,</hi> and the <hi>Echini Marini,</hi> and of these I have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Specimens in my Custody.</p>
               <p>I consider next the formed Stones, and those are the <hi>Bufonites,</hi> the <hi>Belemnites,</hi> and the <hi>Ophites</hi> or <hi>Cornu Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monis,</hi> so denominated from the figure of a <hi>Serpent,</hi> or the Horn of a <hi>Ram.</hi> The <hi>Bufonites</hi> I have seen in Marle near <hi>Preston</hi> in <hi>Lancashire;</hi> the <hi>Belemnites</hi> in a Free-stone Rock near <hi>Stockport</hi> in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> in which Rock likewise are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable several small Pebbles, that lie frequently in black <hi>Capsulae,</hi> and as I have been inform'd by the Masons, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a living <hi>Toad</hi> has been found in Free-stone Rock, in the like <hi>Cista</hi> or Cavity, which doubtless must be lodg'd there in this following manner: It is to be presum'd that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61347:78"/>
the <hi>Ovum</hi> of some <hi>Toad</hi> was brought thither by a Spring or Vein leading to that Cavity, for Springs are very often discern'd in Free-stone Rocks, ouzing thorow their Pores; now it cannot be imagin'd that it was lodg'd there ever since the Deluge, which must necessarily follow, unless we allow the recited Hypothesis. Of the <hi>Lapis Serpenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> there are two sorts, the one bears the Image of a <hi>Viper</hi> wreath'd up in spiral Lines, and that I have seen in the Copper Slates in <hi>Furness</hi> in <hi>Lancashire;</hi> the other the shape of a <hi>Serpent</hi> at length, and this was found in a Free-stone Rock at <hi>Haigh</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and communicated to me by that learned Lady, the Lady <hi>Guise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Shells remarkable in these Parts, they are either the large <hi>Sea-Cockle,</hi> in which I never yet saw Fish, the <hi>Navel Shells,</hi> the <hi>Turbo,</hi> the <hi>Echinites,</hi> the large <hi>Wilkes</hi> or <hi>Periwinckles;</hi> these are cast upon the Sea-Coasts in great numbers; there is likewise another Shell which resembles the Scabbard of a Sword, and by the Sea-men commonly call'd the <hi>Sword-Fish;</hi> the <hi>Echinites</hi> has several little Hairs that grow thro' small Orifices, but I could never discover a Fish in any of these, which that I should not, has often caus'd my wonder: I imagin therefore that they are brought from a great distance to the Shore, by the violence of Storms, and that the Fishes in those turbid Commotions quit their Shells. Of the <hi>Pectinites</hi> there are various sorts, and those variegated sometimes with red parallel Circles, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are smooth, sometimes they have little Protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berances upon their superficies, as has likewise the large <hi>Sea-Cockle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us now come to that grand Enquiry of the learned <hi>Steno, (viz.)</hi> Whether or no Rocks were at first a Fluid, and by subsidence of terrene gross Particles form'd into that substance? The clearing of this point will depend upon the Phaenomena observable in them, and those are chiefly Flints, and a kind of Pebbles that will run into a Glass: Now it is most evident that these are of a Nature very different from
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61347:78"/>
that of the Rock, and have likewise never in any Age been observ'd to germinate; we may hence reasonably allow that Rocks were first fluid, and that different kinds of Fluids did then precipitate by specific Gravity, that eternal stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard communicated to them from the first formation of Bodies, which doubtless did in a great measure depend upon the Magnitude and Number of their Pores, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to those variously subsided: Conformable to these Phaenomena is <hi>Moses</hi>'s History of the Creation, where in the first Chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi> he tells us, that <hi>the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep,</hi> and that <hi>the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</hi> But these last Words are more aptly expressed by <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius,</hi> those two great Masters of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Language, who from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text translate it not <hi>Movebat,</hi> but <hi>Spiritus Dei incubabat superficiei aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> that is, <hi>the spirit of God brooded upon the face of the waters;</hi> a Metaphor taken from a Fowl hatching her young ones. The Explication of which Text further evinces, that at the Creation, before any thing was reduc'd to form, this Globe was an immense Liquid, consisting of all sorts of Particles. Hence not only from Phaenomena in Nature, but likewise from Divine Writ it is evident that these prodigious Mountains were the subsidence of a Fluid; wherefore how rugged soever these may appear to the Eye, yet even these, if we pry into their innermost Recesses, undeniably evidence the Power of Nature, and the Exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of an omnipotent Being; so that tho' there was not an universal dissolution of their <hi>Strata</hi> at the Deluge, as was before manifested, yet to account for the various Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena observable in those Mountains, it is certain that they must once have been fluid Bodies, and successively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durated into these hard Consistences by their own Gravity, and the Heat and Salts of the ambient Air, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding of the Waters, as <hi>Moses</hi> clearly evinces in the same Chapter, where <hi>God said, Let the waters under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:61347:79"/>
                  <hi>be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear, and it was so, and the evening and the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were the first day.</hi> Which brings me to a small Digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, in enquiring what in those Antediluvian Ages was meant by a Day, an Hour, or a Year.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Latin</hi> word <hi>Hora</hi> has been judg'd by some to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifies to limit or bound, because it is the measure of Time, so in Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics comes the word <hi>Horizon,</hi> because that termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates the sight; but <hi>Macrobius</hi> and <hi>Pausanias</hi> both alledge that its original is owing to the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> because the Sun in their Language was stiled <hi>Horum;</hi> the Septuagint In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters would have it indifferently to express a short space of time, hence in St. <hi>Luke</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is used for Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-time; some are of Opinion that Hours anciently sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd the four Seasons of the Year, hence the <hi>Greek</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals call'd them their <hi>Hori,</hi> and their Writers <hi>Horographici;</hi> some there are that think the <hi>Greeks</hi> call'd that part of Time an Hour wherein the Dog-star arises, hence <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book <hi>De Alimentis,</hi> calls those <hi>Horean Fruits</hi> which spring up at that time wherein the Dog-star arose; In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral by an Hour the Ancients have signify'd an Age, and by the twelfth Hour Old Age, as some would have it, hence in that Dialogue of <hi>Marcus Crassus</hi> and the K. of <hi>Galatia,</hi> comes that Expression, <hi>What Man,</hi> says he, <hi>art not thou now arrived at the twelfth Hour, and yet talkest of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new City?</hi> but I am apt to think this might rather be Metaphorically spoken, because in the computation of Time for the greatest part, so many Hours terminate the artificial Day; it might therefore not unaptly be compar'd to the Period of Old Age. <hi>Herodotus</hi> relates that the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> from the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> receiv'd the use of the Pole, the Gnomon, and the twelve parts of the Day, and the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of that Use among the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> was because their Priests in those Days were accustomed twelve times a Day to make a noise to their <hi>Cynocephalus;</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> takes
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61347:79"/>
notice of such a Ceremony to <hi>Serapis,</hi> from which it seems clear that an Hour in those Days was the same as now in the computation of Time; and that Dial of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> where the Miracle was wrought of the Sun's going back ten Degrees, seems to confirm that the <hi>Iews</hi> in those days computed Time in the like manner, for all Interpreters agree those Degrees were the Indices of such parts of the Day; and the descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption that <hi>Pancirollus</hi> gives us of an Instrument amongst the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> farther evinces the truth of this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis: <q>They took (says he) a Vessel made of Glass, in the bottom of which was a narrow Hole done about with Gold, lest the Water should wear it away; on the other part of the Vessel was drawn a right Line, having the 12 Hours set upon it; after which they filled the Vessel with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which issued drop by drop out of the little Hole; they thrust a Cork into the Water fastned to a little Wand, the end of which pointed at the first Hour, and as the Water decreased at the second and third Hour, and so on; this the <hi>Greeks</hi> call'd <hi>Clepsydra.</hi>
                  </q> From all which, both from the Practice of the <hi>Iews, Aegyptians, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> it is most probable that the Antediluvians computed Time as we do now, and that <hi>Noah</hi> very likely transmitted those Instructions down to his Posterity.</p>
               <p>The next thing therefore to be consider'd is to illustrate what is meant by Days: Days by all Nations are divided into two kinds, the one natural, the other artificial, the one consisting of twelve, the other of twenty-four Hours; having therefore fully explain'd what the Ancients meant by Hours, I need not farther to insist upon this Point. I shall then proceed to explain what is meant by a Year: The word <hi>Annus,</hi> or Year, in the three ancient Languages is deriv'd from a thing that turns round, or a Circle, for so much the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word does signify <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; hence the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> represented the Year by a <hi>Snake</hi> biting its Tail, but whether a Lunar or Solar Year is meant by the Patriarchs, is next to be consider'd. The <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> use
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61347:80"/>
the Lunar Year, and the same Custom is observed in <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, Siam, Iapan, Peru,</hi> and in other Places; but <hi>Kepler</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that the <hi>Iews</hi> after their departure out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> used only the Solar Year, <q>The Patriarchs, says he, used the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Year of 365 Days, and divided them into 12 Months; and it is certain the Jewish Year, until the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Monarchy, was wholly Solar, that all their Months, save the last, consisted of 30 Days;</q> and <hi>Iosephus</hi> writes that there was no Innovation in their Rites as to their Year, wherefore from the afore-recited Authorities, and likewise from the <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Hieroglyphical representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Year, it is highly reasonable to conclude, that the Years spoken of by the Patriarchs were Solar Years, or 12 Months, in which the Sun perfects its Course in the Zodiac: So that what some have offer'd to prove an Hour or Month to be a Year amongst the Ancients, is groundless, and is only a metaphorical Allusion to a Custom very frequent in the Eastern Countries.</p>
               <p>To conclude, from all the recited Phaenomena, if we will but appeal to our Senses, it is evident that <hi>Moses</hi>'s Narrative of the Deluge is not only the most true, but the most compleat; I cannot therefore but admire at the <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whiston,</hi> who affirm that before the Deluge there were no Mountains: In the first place the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they offer are no way conclusive, but barely Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical, a meer begging of the Question; they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed supply'd us with polite Schemes, and witty Allegories, and where they do not by dint of Reason convince us, like <hi>Sirens,</hi> by their Wit they charm us: but it is not Paint that can long preserve the Features, after that is once dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, the Face appears more deform'd; I can no more think the World before the Deluge was form'd like an Egg, or that there were no Mountains, or that upon the breach of the Shell the Waters gush'd out and overwhelm'd the Globe, than I can espouse that wild Notion of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, who fancy'd himself an Egg, and dreaded lest the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61347:80"/>
Heavens should fall and destroy him: What <hi>Moses</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd upon that Subject exactly quadrates with Nature, and from his History it is very clear, that there were Mountains before the Flood; in the seventh Chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi> he says, <hi>the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered; fifteen cubits upwards did the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters prevail, and the mountains were covered.</hi> Whence it is plain that before the Deluge there were Mountains, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise how could they be cover'd; he may as well reconcile the contradiction of a Man covering his Head with his Hat, when he had none upon his Shoulders, and the one Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity is as easily defended as the other. In the same Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that inspir'd Philosopher very clearly conveys to us the beginning, progress, and conclusion of the Deluge, all which throughly consider'd, one would think, to any unbiass'd Person are Arguments too plain and convincing to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated; for let us take him barely and literally as an Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, where he acquaints us, that <hi>the fountains of the great deep were broken open, the windows or the clouds of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven poured down their waters,</hi> for it rained forty Days and forty Nights. What can we imagin those Fountains to be but the Freshes separated by the Earth from the Sea, which upon those Convulsions of the Earth, when it was broken open, issued forth upon its surface? And then that great fall of Waters from the Clouds, which doubtless incessant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vehemently pour'd down Night and Day, joyning with them, might easily cause that general Inundation. To those that alledge the deficiency of the Waters to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish so universal a Flood, let us by plain Text and Demonstration answer; in the first Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> when <hi>the earth was without form and void,</hi> then <hi>darkness was upon the face of the deep,</hi> which plainly shews (as was asserted before) that this Globe was a meer immense Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, for the Earth surely would have had a Form, tho' Darkness had been upon it, had it then been separated from
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61347:81"/>
the Waters, but upon their subsidence dry Land appeared, and received a Form; wherefore then by a very reasonable Consequence could not that Power, that made the first great separation of Fluids from Solids, once again cover all with Fluids? or why could not the same proportionate quantity of Liquids, that could dilute such a Mass of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, once again overwhelm them? but where was then the necessity of a total dissolution of all the <hi>Strata</hi> of the Earth at the Deluge? or why must all again return to its primitive Chaos without form? Besides the Evidence of all the recited Phaenomena, <hi>Moses</hi> very readily clears that difficulty, for Chap. 7. he tells us, that <hi>the Ark was lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up above the Earth,</hi> that <hi>all the high hills and mountains were covered;</hi> which lifting or floating of the Ark above the Earth, and covering of the Hills and Mountains, seems to be very dissonant to a Dissolution; not but that a strange Catastrophe occur'd to the superficies of the Earth, by the resistless motions of the Waters, which gave so many evidences of their Power and Universality at that time: Again, Chap. 8. <hi>The waters returned from off the earth,</hi> not separated as at the Creation, and again that <hi>they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased continually, till the tops of the mountains were seen.</hi> Upon the whole I can see no reason why any should so elaborately endeavour to answer Difficulties, where none present themselves, and that by so quaint a Method, as to amuse the Reader by starting greater.</p>
               <p>Having now from Observations in Nature and Divine History, given an account of the Deluge, that we may form some Idea of it, I thought it not inconsistent with my Design, to insert the following Phaenomenon. About three Years ago near <hi>Hyde</hi> in <hi>Cheshire</hi> happen'd an unusual Flood, which overwhelm'd the Banks of the River, and violently broke in at the Eye of a Coal-Pit, the Water in its impetuous Current thro' the hollows forc'd the Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, which when pent up in the Extremities of those Passages, by its Elasticity divided a solid Rock at least 20
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61347:81"/>
Yards perpendicular; the Water over the greatest part of the Field appear'd in large Columns, not much unlike the Spouts in <hi>Africa;</hi> when having spent its force, the Rock clos'd again, and all over the Field were to be seen various pieces of Coal scatter'd. Hence we may imagin when all the Springs of the Deep were broken up, and the Clouds pour'd down their Waters in continued Cataracts for forty Days and Nights, in so strange a Convulsion, I say, from the recited Phaenomenon, we may form some inadequate Idea, how that terrible Destruction was accomplish'd.</p>
               <p>And since we are treating of Floods, I think it a pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Digression, if I give an account of a Spout seen by my Brother within these two Years, in his Voyage to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia.</hi> The figure of it (as he affirms) was like a Spire-Steeple inverted, and hung for a considerable time from the Clouds to the surface of the Sea; it afterwards divided, and then the Sea was in a most violent Commotion, which was observ'd by the flowering of the Water, as he stiled it; the lower Pillar hung for a considerable time upon the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Water, but at length vanished, the upper part from the Clouds remain'd longer. His Conjecture is, that the Spout was not a Column of Water that ascended out of the Sea, but a Cloud only that hung down to the surface of the Water, and he gives these Reasons for it, first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the upper part of the Pillar continued much longer than the lower part, after its division: in the second place, before the Spout appear'd the Air was extreamly dark, and by that the Sea-men predicted the appearance of a Spout. What former accounts we have of Spouts in Authors, are different from this, whether therefore there may be various sorts of Spouts, I shall not determine, as being forreign to this Undertaking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dampier</hi> confirms this Account, by the Description which he gives us of a Spout in his first Volume, <hi>pag.</hi> 451. he says, <q>It is a small ragged piece or part of a Cloud, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down about a Yard seemingly from the blackest part
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61347:82"/>
thereof; commonly it hangs down sloping from thence, or sometimes appearing with a small bending, or elbow in the middle; I never saw any hang perpendicularly down. It is small at the lower end, seeming no bigger than ones Arm, but it is fuller towards the Cloud from whence it proceeds. When the surface of the Water begins to work, you shall see the Sea for about 100 Paces in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference foam and move gently round, till the whir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Motion encreases, and then it flies upward in a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar about 100 Paces in compass at the bottom, but lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gradually upwards to the smallness of the Spout it self, there where it reacheth the lower end of the Spout, thro' which the rising Sea-Water seems to be convey'd into the Clouds; this visibly appears by the Clouds en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing in bulk and blackness, then you shall presently see the Cloud drive along, altho' before it seem'd to be without any Motion, the Spout also keeping the same course with the Cloud, and still sucking up Water as it goes along, and they make a Wind as they go: thus it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues for the space of half an Hour, more or less, until the sucking is spent, and then breaking off, all the Water which was below the Spout, or pendulous piece of Cloud, falls down again into the Sea, making a great noise with its fall and clashing Motion in the Sea. </q>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 452. he adds farther,<q>'One Capt. <hi>Records</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> bound for the Coasts of <hi>Guinea,</hi> in a Ship of 300 Tuns, and 16 Guns, call'd the <hi>Blessing;</hi> when he came into the Latitude of 7 or 8 Degrees North, he saw several Spouts, one of which came directly towards the Ship, and he having no Wind to get out of the way of the Spout, made ready to receive it, by furling his Sails; it came on very swift, and broke a little before it reach'd the Ship, making a great noise, and raising the Sea round it, as if a great House, or some such thing had been cast into the Sea. The fury of the Wind still lasted, and took the Ship on the Starboard-Bow with such violence, that it snapt off the Boltsprit and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61347:82"/>
Fore-Mast both at once, and blew the Ship all along, ready to over-set it; but the Ship did presently right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and the Wind whirling round, took the Ship a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time with the like fury as before, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary side, and was again like to over-set her the other way; the Mizen-Mast felt the fury of the second Blast, and was snapt short off, as the Fore-Mast and Boltsprit had been before; it came on very swift, making a great noise, and raising the Sea round it, as if a great House, or some such thing had been cast into the Sea.</q> From these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances it is undeniably evident, that a Spout is rather a Cloud, than a Pillar of Water, rising in a pyramidal form out of the Sea, as some affirm in their Voyages upon the Coasts of <hi>Africa,</hi> or such a Column of Water occasion'd by a Commotion in the subterraneous Abyss, as Dr <hi>Woodward</hi> in his <hi>Philosophical Essay</hi> alledges.</p>
               <p>To these I will only add an Instance or two more, which might easily slip an undiscerning Eye, and tho' the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to some may seem trivial, yet I doubt not but the Matter when rightly consider'd, carries weight along with it, and may justly challenge our Enquiry. I have in some Parts several Leagues from the Ocean, two Yards within Marle, seen Stones of a considerable magnitude most exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided, yet adapted to that height of Symmetry, and nice proportion of Parts when join'd, that no Tallies, nor the most curiously divided Bodies, could more exactly close their Fissures, and in an horizontal Line betwixt these 8 or 10 Yards of Marle interposing: Considering therefore that those Stones in all probability were originally but one, the distance betwixt them and their depth in the Marle, it must surely be most consonant to Reason to conclude that they were only split, not dissolved in that unaccountable hurry at the Deluge, and embalm'd there to perpetuate its Veracity; betwixt these are often to be found marine Shells, which sufficiently evidences this Hypothesis. Nor have we those Disports only of Shells and fossile Plants, in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61347:83"/>
that are impregnated with <hi>Spar, Alabaster, Bitumen,</hi> and the <hi>Pyrites,</hi> but likewise other Phaenomena of the like Nature, particularly at the <hi>Kennel-Pits</hi> at <hi>Haigh</hi> in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cashire,</hi> in several Slates of which I have seen long parallel Cylinders join'd together, and running in direct Lines, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in solid Stone, twice the length of a Man's Finger, and the breadth or more of his Hand; an evident Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that this firm Substance must originally be a Fluid, which allowed, it will be no difficulty to account for the various representations of Shells and Vegetables: These were first communicated to me by that honoured and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lady, the Lady <hi>Guise,</hi> Mother to the present Lady <hi>Bradshaw</hi> of <hi>Haigh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But farther to demonstrate that Solids were originally Fluids, a more convincing Instance cannot be produc'd than in the Stone call'd <hi>Buphthalmos,</hi> or <hi>Ox-Eye,</hi> so stiled from the analogy it bears to that Organ: In this there is a Pebble of a sable Colour, included in an Alabaster Spar, and the Spar so strictly adheres to the surface of the Pebble, without the least unevenness, and composes so exactly a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex figure like that of an Eye, that it is impossible they should come into that shape, but as the Chymists term it, <hi>In statu fluoris:</hi> These are found on the Sea-Coasts in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cashire,</hi> and <hi>Wirehal</hi> in <hi>Cheshire.</hi>

               <p>THE Curious here have a large Field of Philosophy to range in, since both the Seas and Rivers in these Counties present us almost with an infinite variety of these Creatures: I shall not expatiate upon each particular Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Fishes, but only take notice of the most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which have occur'd to my Observation, in the Seas, Rivers, Ponds and Meers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:61347:83"/>
The Seas frequently afford us <hi>Seales,</hi> or <hi>Sea-Calfs,</hi> and those of different Magnitudes; they are often thrown up in Salt-Rivers form'd by the Tides, some I have seen eight, some twelve Foot long, but these are most common in the <hi>Baltic</hi> Ocean, where the <hi>Russes</hi> take them in great quantities; the Method is very remarkable, They gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally go out in great Numbers to hunt them, sometimes they find three or four Thousand together, basking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the Ice; these then they surround, which when the <hi>Sea-Calfs</hi> discern, they pile themselves upon an heap (as it is probable) by that means to break the Ice, and quit themselves from the Enemy, which they sometimes do, and frequently so bend the Ice, that they are oblig'd to wade to a considerable depth to attack them; so remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is the Principle of Self-preservation in all Creatures whatever. Their Food is upon Fish, but I found by one which I had alive, that he could not eat under Water, and when he div'd for his Prey he clos'd his Mouth and Eyes, and pursed up his Nostrils so close, that the least drop of Water could not enter: I did not find that he could continue long under Water, but frequently mounted up into the Air, and then immediately dived again. They are extreamly smooth, and will bite severely, having Mouths like those of <hi>Tygers,</hi> and indeed when provoked, make their Attacks with that kind of spitting, harring Noise.</p>
               <p>I thought it not amiss to add the Account which <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier</hi> gives of the <hi>Sea-Dog,</hi> call'd by the Dutch <hi>Hound,</hi> which is agreeable to the shape and size of those which I saw: <q>They are (says he <hi>p.</hi> 89.) as big as <hi>Calves,</hi> the Head of them like a <hi>Dog,</hi> and therefore by the Dutchmen call'd <hi>Sea-Hounds,</hi> but it had been more proper if they had said <hi>English Bull-Dogs:</hi> Under each Shoulder grows a long thick Fin, these serve them to swim with when they are at Sea, and are instead of Legs to them when on Land, for raising their Bodies up on end by the help of these Fins or Strumps, and so having their Tail-parts drawn close
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61347:84"/>
under them, they are bound, as it were, and throw their Bodies forward, drawing their hinder Parts after them, and then again rise up and springing forward with their fore Parts alternately, they lie tumbling thus up and down all the time they are moving on Land; from their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to their Tails they grow tapering like Fish, and have two small Fins on each side the Rump, which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cover'd with their Fins; these Fins serve instead of a Tail on the Sea, and on Land they sit on them when they give suck to their Young: Their Hair is of divers Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, as black, grey, dun, spotted, looking very sleek and pleasant when they come first out of the Sea.</q>

               <p>The next remarkable Fish is the <hi>Sepia,</hi> or <hi>Ink-Fish,</hi> of which I have seen several upon these Shores; it has ten Horns, not much unlike those of a <hi>Snail,</hi> and with these, as with Oars, it rowes it self forward in the Water; it has two full Eyes, its substance seems to be a kind of Pulp, and one half of it is invested with a <hi>Membrane</hi> like a Leg within a Stocking, and therefore by some it is call'd the <hi>Hose</hi> or <hi>Stocking-Fish;</hi> it has only one Bone, and that upon its Back, thin, flat and pellucid; from its Mouth descend two pellucid Ducts, which terminate in a <hi>Vesica</hi> which contains its Ink, by pressing this the Ink quickly ascends, and as some Naturalists affirm, when they are-in danger of being taken, by contracting this they discharge such a quantity of Ink as blackens the Water, and secures them from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; I have a Letter by me writ with this Ink about ten Years ago, which still continues: this Liquor was the Ink of the Ancients, hence came that Expression of the Poet, <hi>Nigro distillans Sepianodo;</hi> it has no remarkable Tast, and by reason that the whole substance seems to be a kind of Pulp, it is hard to determine whether this Liquor is its Chyle, or perhaps the Juices of some Sea-Plant which it lives upon, or else a Liquor separated from its nutritive Juices; for what else to term it I know not, since I could not observe in it either Veins or Arteries, yet doubtless there
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61347:84"/>
are other Vessels adequate to those. This Fish sometimes the People eat, and it is observable, that it will mildly purge them, like <hi>Cassia,</hi> or some such Lenitive.</p>
               <p>The next to be remark'd are the <hi>Pisces Vaginales,</hi> so call'd because they resemble the <hi>Pudenda</hi> of a Woman; these stick fast in the Sand, and are scarce to be pulled out, when you touch them, they contract strongly, and emit a Liquor like that of the <hi>Vagina in Coitu;</hi> of these there are great quantities on the Sands near <hi>Leverpoole,</hi> and other parts of the County of <hi>Lancaster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have frequently cast upon the Sea-shore the <hi>Sea-Blebs,</hi> the whole substance of which seems to be nothing but a perfect Gelly, and to view it, you would wonder how it had Life; only in the Center of it is a knot of Vessels which appears red, and is branched like the Leaves of the <hi>Herba Paris,</hi> or <hi>True Lovers Knot,</hi> and in these no doubt the greatest part of the Circulation is perform'd: 'Tis won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to me, what the use of that Gelly can be, and whether or no it has any communication with that knot of Vessels, with Microscopes I could not discern any: This by being too long held in the Hand, is apt to make it break out in Pustules.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Star-Fish,</hi> so call'd from the resemblance it bears to a Star, is very common in these Parts; its Stomach is in its Center, and the rest of its Body is fibrous, which no doubt conveys a Liquor analogous to Blood or Chyle; when touch'd it contracts very strongly, and I presume its Food is Sea-Plants: Male and Female in these I could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, but presume that they are rather of an Hermaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite species; these are not of any known use, as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Sometimes we have <hi>Whales</hi> and <hi>Sturgeons,</hi> but these very rarely, one of the latter I saw taken near <hi>Warrington</hi> of about 12 Foot long, and 2 Foot deep.</p>
               <p>Three Fishes I took of an unusual shape, and cannot find the figure of them in any Author; their Heads are extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary large, and their Aspect terrible, they have two large
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61347:85"/>
Eyes upon the midst of their Foreheads, an extraordinary wide Mouth, and different Rows of Teeth, like those of a <hi>Shark,</hi> and within the Stomach equal Rows of Teeth pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to those above, and no doubt but there must be a Mastication there, as in the Mouth. They have no Gills, but instead of those Bones like cross Bars, from their Spine there are not any Bones that branch forth as in other Fishes, like Teeth from the midst of a Comb, instead of those they have a round pellucid Body, not unlike a blown Bladder; from the Head along the Body there are Bones descending in Lines, like the Meridians of a Globe: The rest of the Body is like that of a <hi>Dog-Fish,</hi> they have a Stomach, Bowels and Liver, but I could discern no Lungs; their <hi>Membra Genitalia</hi> seem to be after the manner of <hi>Dog-Fish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Green-back</hi> and <hi>Mullets</hi> are very common, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford an excellent Nourishment and a delicate Tast; we have likewise great quantities of <hi>Soles,</hi> a species of <hi>Flounders,</hi> these are in my thoughts the best of Fishes; the <hi>Turbut</hi> is likewise very common and very palatable; the <hi>Sand-Eels</hi> are very frequently taken, and dug out of the Sands by the Fishermen, like Worms; and it is not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing prospect to observe the infinite number of little heaps like Mole-hills, form'd by the Worms themselves upon the Sands; these are only the Faeces of the Worms, collected by their twisting round one another in so exact a figure, that the Fishermen by their magnitude can judge, what Worm is fittest for their purpose, and accordingly dig up such or such a Bed. The <hi>Oyster</hi> and <hi>Lobster</hi> are very common, and likewise the <hi>Shrimp</hi> and <hi>Prawn;</hi> the <hi>Prawn</hi> is a Fish not much unlike the <hi>Shrimp,</hi> but much larger, and far better Meat, and in my thoughts the most pleasing of any Shell-Fish whatever; it generates in Eggs, and of these it deposites an infinite number, which by a clammy Matter it fastens to the Rocks, and piles them one upon another, till they look like a Pyramid inverted, and hang like Icicles on the Verge of a Penthouse. We have
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61347:85"/>
the best and largest <hi>Cockles</hi> in <hi>England</hi> here, and <hi>Muscles</hi> in that number, that upon the Sea-Coasts they manure their Ground with them. The <hi>Pearl-Muscles</hi> are very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: Which leads me to give an account of the Germina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pearls.</p>
               <p>The Formation of the Shells of <hi>Muscles</hi> I have observ'd from the bigness of a Pins head, to 2 Inches in length, and find in their first Formation, that the Shells are pellucid, but afterwards, as the <hi>Lamellae</hi> are constantly formed, they become opaque; their substance at first seems to me to be a Gluten thrown off from the Fish, and indurated by the Air; as the Fish grows in bigness, it still emits a greater quantity of this, and so the Shell continually encreases, till it arrives to its full hardness and maturity. In these Shells (and likewise in <hi>Oyster-</hi>shells) I have frequently found <hi>Pearls,</hi> some just appearing thro' the innermost <hi>Lamellae,</hi> others half thro', some hanging like Fruit upon a Pedestall, others dropt from the Mother of <hi>Pearl,</hi> and sticking on the out-side of the Fish; whence it is plain that <hi>Pearls</hi> are not form'd by Dews, (as some have observ'd,) nor within the Fish, (as others,) but in the Shell it self. I find the <hi>Pearls</hi> as well as the Shells to consist of various <hi>Laminae,</hi> wrapt one within another, and betwixt the <hi>Mater Perla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> and the <hi>Pearl</hi> I could never observe any extraordinary difference, only I think the <hi>Pearl</hi> makes a greater fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with an Acid; whence it is most probable, that the most Volatile part of the <hi>Mater Perlarum</hi> protrudes it self from the rest of the <hi>Laminae,</hi> and so constantly presses forwards till it forces its passage into the Shell it self, and so forms the <hi>Pearl.</hi> They are generally of a Sphaerical fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, made so (I conjecture) by the figure of the Shell; these <hi>Pearls</hi> are of great use in Physic, and did the People industriously apply themselves to the getting of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable quantities might be acquired, at a less Price than <hi>Crabs Eyes,</hi> which they infinitely surpass, tho' they were genuine, but for the most part they are adulterated, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61347:86"/>
instead of <hi>Crabs Eyes</hi> we have meerly a Composition of <hi>Chalk</hi> and <hi>Mucilage,</hi> or perhaps <hi>Tobacco-pipe Clay,</hi> to the infinite prejudice of the Patient.</p>
               <p>From what has been observ'd in the Germination of <hi>Pearls,</hi> it is evident that what <hi>Christophorus Sandius</hi> from <hi>Hamburgh</hi> transmitted to the <hi>Royal Society</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> must necessarily be a Mistake; which that the Reader may more easily apprehend, I shall transcribe the Account he gave to that learn'd Body, and leave it to any unprejudic'd Person to judge of his Error: since any of the most Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious may any day in the Year, in the River <hi>Wire</hi> near <hi>Hambleton</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> have a full Demonstration to the contrary. The first Letter runs thus, being translated by the Publisher of the <hi>Philosophical Transactions, March 25. A. D.</hi> 1674.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Touching the Origin of <hi>Pearls,</hi> of which I formerly gave an Intimation, be pleas'd to receive the following Account. The <hi>Pearl-</hi>shells in <hi>Norway</hi> and elsewhere do breed in sweet Waters. Their Shells are like to those which commonly are call'd <hi>Muscles,</hi> but they are larger; the Fish in them looks like an <hi>Oyster,</hi> and it produces a great cluster of Eggs, like those of <hi>Cra-Fishes,</hi> some white, some black, (which latter will yet become white, the outer black Coat being taken off) these Eggs when ripe are cast out, and being cast out they grow, and become like those that cast them; but sometimes it happens that one or two of these Eggs stick fast to the sides of the Matrix, and are not voided with the rest: these are fed by the <hi>Oyster</hi> against its Will, and they do grow, according to the length of Time, into Pearls of different bignesses, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print a Mark both in the Shell and Fish, by the situation conform to its figure.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon which I cannot but remark in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and indeed in doing that, can scarce confine my self within the Rules of Decency, there being not one true Line in the whole Letter: For in the first place they do not
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61347:86"/>
always breed in fresh, but likewise in salt Waters, as is evident in the River <hi>Wire,</hi> where the Water is continually salt, and when the Tide flows, little less brackish than the Sea it self; in the second place, the Shell is not only like that of a <hi>Muscle,</hi> but the Fish also is a real <hi>Muscle,</hi> and not an <hi>Oyster;</hi> in the third place, in those Fishes never any Eggs are discern'd, consequently it is not possible that the Pearl should be the Egg of the Fish, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it is demonstrable, by the Instances above-recited, that the Pearls are various Protrusions from the <hi>Laminae</hi> of the Shell, and those I have observ'd as well in the black, as in the chrystalline <hi>Laminae,</hi> having frequently seen black Pearls, as well as the chrystalline ones, which are so many Enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopments of the Mother of Pearls; Fourthly, by what is alledg'd it is evident, that these are not fed by the <hi>Oyster</hi> against its Will, and that they do not any farther imprint a Mark into the Shell, than by dropping out of it, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed after that they do commonly leave a Bruise there, by which you may easily discern how many Pearls have vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from each particular Shell: A Phaenomenon not much unlike this I once observ'd at <hi>Oxford</hi> in a <hi>Water-Rat</hi> that was pregnant, upon a Dissection of her, for by opening the <hi>Ovaria,</hi> we found as many Knots in those, as there were young ones in the <hi>Uterus.</hi> His second Letter was dated the 27. of <hi>February,</hi> 1674. and is as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>As to the Authority I have to assert such an Origin of Pearls, as I have done in my former, I here declare that a certain <hi>Dane,</hi> call'd <hi>Henricus Arnoldi,</hi> an ingenious and veracious Person, having by his own Experience found it so at <hi>Christiania</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> did in that manner relate it to me, as I imparted it to you, he having with great serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness assur'd me of the truth thereof: besides the thing seems highly probable, neither do any considerable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections appear against it; if I should chance to go into those Parts, or at least into the Country of the Duke of <hi>Brunswick,</hi> where also Pearls are found, not inferior to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61347:87"/>
the Oriental ones of the same size, I should not fail to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make the Observation my self.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From what has been before observ'd, it is plain his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis is not probable, and that there are unanswerable Objections against it; so that his very All centring only in a Relation from the foremention'd <hi>Dane,</hi> is altogether fictitious, nor do I believe there are Pearls, either in <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swick,</hi> or any other part of the World yet known, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to those in <hi>East-India,</hi> the Mother of Pearl of the <hi>Oysters</hi> in those Parts being much finer than any discover'd here, or in the <hi>West-Indies:</hi> And if so (by what has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd) it is most certain, that the Pearls must be finer also, which are only the most refin'd parts of those defecated <hi>Laminae</hi> of the Shell. It is true indeed there are in fresh Waters hereabout <hi>Muscles</hi> of the magnitude he mentions, which are commonly call'd <hi>Horse-Muscles,</hi> of these vast numbers were found in the Pond at <hi>Tabley</hi> in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> when it was drein'd, but not any of them contain'd Pearls, nor was the Fish palatable. These, I think, may serve for a full Answer to <hi>Sandius</hi>'s Hypothesis, I shall not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore transgress longer on the Reader's patience, but only take notice of the <hi>Phosphori,</hi> or flashes of Fire in the Night-time, frequently observable in <hi>Muscles</hi> and <hi>Oysters,</hi> and so close this Head.</p>
               <p>It is observable that these Fishes abound with a great quantity of volatile Sulphur, and hence it is, that in Tabid Cases, as in scorbutic Atrophies, they are of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary use, for their sulphureous Particles being commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the Mass of Blood, they afresh inspirit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store it to its due Circulation, and then the Blood distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes its nourishment to the Body, which before stagnated in several Capillaries, where for want of a daily supply the Body emaciated. Another confirmation of their great quantity of Sulphur, is their extream foetidness upon Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, which is as offensive as any preparation of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur whatever. These granted, and that Flame it self is
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61347:87"/>
only a due quantity of sulphureous Particles put into a particular Motion, and then again considering what vast numbers of those Particles abound in those Fishes, and their extraordinary Activity, it is easy to imagin how those <hi>Noctilucae,</hi> or flashes in the Night-time, when their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are not scatter'd by the Beams of the Sun, may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be observ'd in them; and it is probable that if some of our <hi>Virtuosi</hi> made their Experiments upon foetid <hi>Oysters,</hi> they might more easily prepare the <hi>Phosphorus,</hi> than from Blood, Flesh, or Urine, which is the common, but very tedious Process.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Echini</hi> are common, as likewise <hi>Torculars, Whilkes</hi> and <hi>Periwinkles;</hi> we have likewise another Fish shap'd like the Head of a <hi>Rabbit,</hi> and thence call'd the <hi>Rabbit-Fish.</hi> The <hi>Pap-Fish</hi> is common, so call'd from the likeness it bears to a Nipple, the Country People use them for their Nipples when sore, which by guarding them from fretting on their Cloaths, give relief. These are the most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of Sea-Fishes that I have observ'd in these Parts, wherefore I shall in the next place descend to River and Pond-Fish, and of these the most remarkable are the <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Sparling</hi> or <hi>Smelt,</hi> and the <hi>Char,</hi> as likewise <hi>Eeles</hi> in the River <hi>Erke</hi> near <hi>Manchester:</hi> And of these I shall shew the difference, and their manner of Generation, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Rivers abound with great quantities of <hi>Salmon,</hi> but chiefly those into which the Sea flows daily, as <hi>Ribble, Lune, Wire,</hi> and the <hi>Mersey,</hi> in these there are consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able numbers taken, but the most in <hi>Ribble</hi> and the <hi>Lune.</hi> Concerning the Growth of these the Opinions are various, some asserting that after the <hi>Salmon</hi> leaves the Sea, she makes to fresh Rivers, and constantly presses forward till she gains the Shallows, and in the Sands, Stones and Peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles deposites her Spawn or Eggs, upon which the Male ejects a Milk which fecundates them, and so the formation of the <hi>Foetus</hi> is begun, which first is stiled a <hi>Salmon-Smelt,</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:61347:88"/>
the second Year a <hi>Sprod,</hi> the third a <hi>Mort,</hi> the fourth a <hi>Forktail,</hi> the fifth a <hi>Runner,</hi> and the sixth a <hi>Salmon.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers assert that the <hi>Salmon</hi> comes to its Maturity in one Year, and the <hi>Morts, Forktails</hi> and <hi>Runners</hi> are a distinct species of <hi>Salmon,</hi> and will never attain to the magnitude of a grown <hi>Salmon,</hi> and that because (as they alledge) se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of these have been put into Ponds, and never arriv'd to any other pitch of greatness. Now it is certain that the <hi>Salmon</hi> are always best, and grow most, when they immediately leave the Seas, and by their continuance in fresh Waters they still decline, and wax leaner; when they first quit the Seas their Flesh is firm and well-tasted, and at that time they have often abundance of little Insects upon them, which the Fishermen call the <hi>Salmon Lowse,</hi> and it is then that she is best in season: The Fishermen will actly tell you, by observing of these, how long they have left the Seas, but upon their continuance long in the Freshes they become extreamly lean, and not at all palatable; so that 'tis probable if these <hi>Morts</hi> and <hi>Sprods</hi> which were taken into Ponds, and did not encrease at all, 'twas because they were out of their proper Food, and so consequently instead of growing did emaciate; for 'tis most certain, when they deserted the salt Water, 'twas not for any Food they expected in fresh Rivers, but indeed to reach the Shallows, as well for the preservation as propagation of their Fry, which in the Deeps would be destroy'd by other Fishes: so admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is the Conduct of Providence even in the meanest of Creatures. Tho' the Rivers are frequently stemm'd and barricado'd with Weares of a considerable height, yet 'tis wonderful to observe how they will leap over these to gain the Shallows, to deposite their Spawn: since therefore the <hi>Smelt</hi> comes down from the Shallows, and makes towards the salt Waters, 'tis probable that the fresh Rivers are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to them; and since the <hi>Sprod</hi> seems to be the same Fish of another Years growth, and the rest likewise gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually till they compleat the <hi>Salmon</hi> it self, I am rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61347:88"/>
to adhere to the former Opinion, for why should not there in this, as in other Creatures, be a gradual Encrease? I apprehend not any convincing Reason to the contrary, nor do I believe Nature here alters her establish'd Methods in arriving to a full Growth and Maturity.</p>
               <p>The next remarkable Fish is the <hi>Char,</hi> and that is found in <hi>Winder-Meer</hi> in <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> and no where else that I know of, except in <hi>Conningston-Meer</hi> in <hi>Lancashire.</hi> This Fish is not very unlike a <hi>Trout,</hi> only the Flesh is much more red, and when Potted, 'tis most delicious Meat; of these great quantities are yearly sent to <hi>London,</hi> from <hi>Kendall</hi> and <hi>Lancaster.</hi> 'Tis likewise observable that these Fishes are only found in one part of <hi>Winder-Meer,</hi> the other part being destitute of them, which perhaps may be occasion'd by the <hi>Pikes</hi> taken there in great quantities. There is another Fish taken there not unlike the <hi>Char,</hi> but something less, nor is the Flesh quite so red. The Water is extraordinary clear, and contains several small Islands, in one of which Sr. <hi>Christopher Philipson</hi> once resided, and in another a Hermite, a Relation of Sr. <hi>Francis Sawcole</hi>'s, who for some Years subsisted only on Roots and Fish, and never went to Bed, but is now dead.</p>
               <p>What farther may be said in relation to the <hi>Char,</hi> was communicated to me by my honour'd Friend and Relation Sr. <hi>Daniel Flemming</hi> of <hi>Rydall</hi> in the County of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Winder-Meer</hi> (says he) according to the <hi>English Saxon</hi> is <hi>Windal-Meer,</hi> which some think to be so deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from the great Winds frequent there, others from its winding and turning in and out, and others from a Person's Name, as well as that of <hi>Thurston-Meer,</hi> now call'd <hi>Coningston-Water</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and that of <hi>Ulfes,</hi> now stiled <hi>Uls-Water</hi> in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> which are both near thereunto, which makes the last Conjecture the most probable.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Lough, Lake</hi> or <hi>Meer,</hi> is about a Mile in breadth, and ten Miles in length, with great variety of crooked
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61347:89"/>
Banks, which afford an agreeable Prospect; it is in several places of a great Depth, and produces many kinds of Fish, as the <hi>Char, Salmon, Pike, Bass, Pearch, Eeles,</hi> &amp;c. This Lake by some is plac'd in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> but by others in <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> which is the more likely, since the Fishery thereof belongs to the Barony of <hi>Kendall,</hi> a Town of great Trade, particularly for Cottons, and the most noted in that County. This Meer is the largest in <hi>England,</hi> and looks as if it was pav'd or flagg'd at the bottom with square Stones, a sight diverting enough in Fishing. Our learned <hi>Clarenceux</hi> was impos'd upon, when he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd that the <hi>Char</hi> was a Fish peculiar to <hi>Winder-Meer,</hi> since in <hi>Coningston-Meer,</hi> within five Miles, a <hi>Char</hi> much fairer and more serviceable is caught.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Char</hi> is a sort of Fish about a quarter long, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like a <hi>Trout,</hi> and generally red belly'd; there are three sorts, the Male, which is large, with a red Belly, but the Flesh thereof somewhat white, having a soft Roe, and is call'd the <hi>Milting-Char;</hi> the Female <hi>Char</hi> is large, but not so red-belly'd, the Flesh is very red, within being full of hard Roes or Spawn, which our Philosophers in their Discoveries sufficiently demonstrate to be the <hi>Ova,</hi> or Eggs of the Fish, which are fecundated by a Milk injected on them by the Male, and perfected by the kind influence of the Sun: the <hi>Ova</hi> thus impregnated, are buried by the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male in Slutch or Sand near the adjacent Banks, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Invigoration, these are commonly call'd the <hi>Roving Charrs;</hi> the third sort having no Roe, is commonly call'd the <hi>Gelt Char.</hi> These <hi>Charrs</hi> differ from the <hi>Welsh Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gough,</hi> a Fish taken in <hi>Carnarvan-shire,</hi> and the <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Rentel,</hi> these being probably the same with the <hi>Case,</hi> a sort of Fish something like the <hi>Char,</hi> but spawning at a different time, and caught in the River <hi>Brathy,</hi> that runs into <hi>Winder-Meer.</hi> The <hi>Char</hi> is not to be caught by Angling, or any other Method but by Nets, they keep gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the deepest parts of the Water, and are most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61347:89"/>
caught in the coldest Weather, when the Banks are cover'd with Snow; the <hi>Char</hi> never swims out of the Meer, but the <hi>Case</hi> is taken in divers Rivers.</p>
               <p>The River <hi>Erke</hi> is remarkable for <hi>Eeles,</hi> which I think I may affirm to be the fattest in <hi>England,</hi> and indeed to that degree of fatness, that they almost nauseate; and this a late Author, a Gentleman of a considerable Estate near <hi>Manchester,</hi> chiefly attributes to the Fat, Grease, and Oyls, which by the Woke-Mills are expressed from the Woolen Cloaths, and so mixed with the Water: And indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the number of these Mills standing upon that River, and the extraordinary fatness of the <hi>Eeles,</hi> I do not think the Conjecture amiss.</p>
               <p>It may now be worth our time to make Enquiry into the manner of the Generation of this kind of Fish: I could not in these, by any Dissection I ever made, observe the distinction of Male and Female, which has given occasion to some to conjecture they came from the middle Region, since Ponds and Pits are found frequently full of them, in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> none had ever been deposited, and therefore 'tis concluded that their <hi>Ova</hi> being so small as not to be discern'd by ocular Inspection, they might be exhal'd with the Waters, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently fall down with the Rains, and when these hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to fall into Rivers and Ponds, they by the influence of the Sun, begin and compleat their Generation. But whence arose those <hi>Ova</hi> to be thus exhal'd? they must needs claim some Origin or Formation before they ascended to the middle Region; there is no doubt but the Rains are oftentimes saturated with <hi>Ova</hi> of divers Species, as may be seen by Putrifaction of the Water, in which an infinite number of small Worms are discern'd, these indeed may be small <hi>Ova</hi> wafted up by the Winds, and descending with the Rains. It is affirm'd in <hi>Russia</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> after excessive Showers, that the Ground is almost cover'd with Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures not unlike <hi>Mice,</hi> which often produce by their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting, pestilential Fevers, which in some occasion'd the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61347:90"/>
like Conjecture; yet this Phaenomenon may admit of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other solution, for why may not those Creatures be there generated, and after the fall of those Rains desert their Cells or <hi>Latebrae,</hi> to bask upon the surface of the Ground, as we daily see here in <hi>Frogs</hi> and <hi>Worms,</hi> and other Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles? However it is, the Ponds that were never stored may be supply'd other ways, for it is usual for <hi>Eeles</hi> to quit the Pits, and creep into the Grass and Ditches, and this I have often observ'd, having found <hi>Eeles</hi> in the midst of Fields, remote from any Pit, by which means other Ponds may be replenish'd with this kind of Fish: for my part I shall not determine the Point, but these being industrious Ages, by the assistance of Microscopes, which are daily improv'd, others may give us farther satisfaction in this Matter.</p>
               <p>But I cannot here omit that remarkable Experiment of the most ingenious <hi>Lewenhooke,</hi> who in this Creature was the first that gave us an ocular Demonstration of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Blood, and beyond contradiction has made it manifest that the Vein and Artery are one continued Canal, shewing a Pulsation in one part of the Vessel, and none in the other, but that the Blood slowly creeping on, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries at their Extremities form a kind of Semicircle; so that the strait Line being terminated, the Systole of the Heart at so great a distance is not able to affect a Curve, for we must imagin the Pulse to be extreamly weak at the Extremities of the Arteries, for when a Vessel deviates from the direct Line of the Power, it thence ceases to be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it; and hence it is that the Veins, tho' they are continued Vessels with the Arteries, have no Pulsation at all. What is said of this Fish generating with <hi>Vipers,</hi> is trifling and ridiculous, for whoever examins the Parts of these two Creatures subservient to Generation, will find it wholly impossible, the Male <hi>Viper</hi> containing a <hi>Penis,</hi> and the Female <hi>Ova</hi> and <hi>Ovaria,</hi> but in <hi>Eeles</hi> neither are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:61347:90"/>
The next remarkable Experiment in this Fish is the long continued Systole and Diastole of the Heart after it is taken out of the Body, which sometimes is for some Hours: This may justly challenge our strictest Enquiry into its Reasons, since (were they clearly demonstrated) it might be of great use in <hi>Anatomy.</hi> From this it is plain that Muscular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not perform'd by the Blood and Nitro-aerial Particles fermenting in Metaphorical Glandules, in which the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the Arteries terminate, which a late young Author forwardly and foolishly affirms, in his small Book of <hi>Muscular Motion;</hi> for it is plain here that the Circulation is cut off, so that this Motion cannot be perform'd by any Blood flowing from the Arteries, in the manner he alledges; besides, the Globules of the Blood it self are discernible by Microscopes, one would think then that these Glandules which separate the Globules, should be much more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable themselves: But these Glandules are neither to be observ'd by Mercurial Injections, nor Microscopical Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; it would be better for the Author to lay by his Suppositions, and much to his advantage to apply himself to an industrious Education, to render himself Master of right Reason, which done, he will soon see the vanity of his own Attempts in this kind. In explaining Muscular Motion, <hi>Borellus</hi> and <hi>Steno</hi> are deficient, and Dr. <hi>Charleton</hi> after all his elaborate Experiments, fairly owns his dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in any Hypothesis, that he could form concerning it; for my part I think it is only to be solved by Him that gave it: How can we suppose Muscular Motion to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in most Shell-fish, which have no Blood nor Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules? yet some of them have very brisk and active Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the <hi>Shrimp</hi> and <hi>Prawn;</hi> or how in Convulsions come the Muscles to contract so strongly? It is impossible a little Blood and <hi>Lympha</hi> should effect this, but indeed (as Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> very well imagins) it is rather a violent Explosion of the Spirits. But then it is impossible that the Spirits should be a Mucilage, (which the foremention'd Author
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61347:91"/>
of <hi>Muscular Motion</hi> affirms, whose unparallel'd Assurance ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits not of a Rival) that being too unactive a Matter to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce such Effects; the Spirits are sure the most volatile, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd parts of Matter we can form any Idea of, wherefore what that Author has writ in relation to this Matter, amounts to no more, than to shew him consummately ignorant.</p>
               <p>One remarkable Fish had almost slipt me, it is call'd the <hi>Cat-Fish,</hi> from the likeness of its Whiskers upon the upper Lip to those of a <hi>Cat:</hi> This Fish is of a Tast indifferently pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latable, but what is most observable in it, is the prick of its Fins, which are of a very poysonous Nature, tho' none of its Bones produce the like Effect; upon a Puncture the part will presently look red, be very painful, and swell to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary bigness, not much unlike a <hi>Phlegmon Erisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piloides:</hi> This is found about the <hi>Peele,</hi> and sometimes near <hi>Heesham.</hi> How this Puncture comes to be of so poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous a Nature, we shall now examine: The Fins look pellucid, and seem hollow, like so many parallel Tubes centring each upon a <hi>Cistus,</hi> impleted with a pellucid Liquor; it is probable therefore that upon the Puncture the Fin pressing upon the <hi>Cistus,</hi> the Liquor contain'd in it necessarily ascends, and mixes with the Blood, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Acrimonious nature, contracts the Capillaries of the <hi>Cutis,</hi> and so causes the Inflammation, perhaps not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that arising by the bite of a <hi>Viper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Fish we have call'd the <hi>Rabbit-Fish,</hi> from the resemblance of its Mouth to that of an <hi>Hare</hi> or <hi>Rabbit:</hi> It is about 4 Inches in length, and as much in depth, the Back of it is arched and sharp, and in its Belly is an Orifice not unlike the <hi>Vagina</hi> of the <hi>Uterus. Lamperns</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> are frequently found, and a small Fish call'd a <hi>Hue,</hi> exactly like an <hi>Anchove,</hi> and like that, by a proper Pickle, its Flesh and Bones will dissolve, this eats as agreeably as those from <hi>Genoa;</hi> vast quantities of these commonly hang in the Nets of the Fishermen, the <hi>Sea-Gulls</hi> feed upon them, and it is a diverting Scene enough to see their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61347:91"/>
Skirmishes about them. The <hi>Skeate, Thornback,</hi> and <hi>Rea,</hi> are taken in great quantities, as likewise the <hi>Dog-Fish,</hi> which some would have to be a species of a <hi>Shark,</hi> but whoever inspects their Jaws, the Roes, Figure, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of their Teeth, will find it only a vulgar Error. They do not externally emit their <hi>Ova,</hi> as many Fishes do, but generate as <hi>Dog</hi> and <hi>Bitch;</hi> in the Womb of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male I have often found a great number of young ones; it is reported that if at any time her Whelps be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they run within her and so secure themselves. They are but ordinary Food, yet are frequently eaten by the Country People. The <hi>Trout</hi> and <hi>Grayling</hi> may be plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully had at <hi>Buxton,</hi> which are generally esteem'd the best in <hi>England;</hi> to these kinds of Fishes I presume the Water issuing from Lime-stone, is most agreeable. I have by me a round flat Bone, taken up from the Sea-Coast near <hi>Hilbree-Island</hi> in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> the inside of which is woven with an infinite number of Vessels, like the Cortical part of the Brain, but to what species of Fish it did belong, or what was the proper use of it, I cannot yet learn; its Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter is about five or six Inches. Since the writing of this I find it to be a Bone betwixt the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of a <hi>Whale.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Reptiles and Insects.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THERE being little room left for making Additions to these, they being describ'd so accurately before by Dr. <hi>Lister</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> I shall not trouble the Reader with Repetition, but only give an account of some particular Observations which I have made. The <hi>Viper</hi> is common in most of our Mosses, as is likewise the <hi>Adder</hi> or <hi>Longworm,</hi> which exceeds the other both in length and thickness, but its Bite is not so poysonous. In what particularly the the Poyson of a <hi>Viper</hi> consists, has been an old Dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61347:92"/>
Monsieur <hi>Charras</hi> and Seignior <hi>Redi;</hi> the one assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Poyson to consist in a yellow Liquor contain'd in a Bladder, at the bottom of its Tooth, which Liquor, upon its biting, by the Pressure of the Bladder, is forc'd thro' a Tube within the Tooth, and consequently into the Wound, and thence ensue very direful Effects; he alledges likewise that by this Liquor <hi>Pigeons</hi> and <hi>Pullets,</hi> by dropping it into a Wound made in either of them, have been kill'd, tho' the Liquor he took from the <hi>Viper</hi> when dead. The other asserts that he has try'd the same Experiments, but observ'd no such Effects at all: These two Seignior <hi>Vigani</hi> has in some measure reconcil'd, who alledges that the yellow Liquor with which Seignior <hi>Redi</hi> kill'd <hi>Pullets</hi> and <hi>Pigeons</hi> after the Death of the <hi>Viper,</hi> was either saturated with the Spirits of the enrag'd <hi>Viper,</hi> by whipping it before, by which means it was render'd more poysonous; or else (as its proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) that in the hot and dry Climes of <hi>Italy,</hi> those Creatures are more venemous than in colder Countries: To me this Conjecture seems reasonable, however what its Venom is, is not so material, but it is certain very noble Medicines are prepared from them, and a Wine from their Flesh, singular in Consumptive, Leprous and Scorbutic Cases; they afford likewise a volatile Salt, the most generous Cordial in Nature.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lizard</hi> is frequently found in the Mosses, and is said to be one of those which the Naturalists stile <hi>Philanthropi,</hi> or Lovers of Men, never (as they say) doing injury to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but destroying any venemous Creature hurtful to him. These are the most noted Reptiles.</p>
               <p>Amongst the Insects we shall begin with the <hi>Grashopper:</hi> This Creature in its Infancy is wonderfully preserv'd by a Froth which it raises upon the surface of some Plant, conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self by that means from Birds, or other Creatures which might destroy it. This Froth by the Vulgar is called <hi>Cuckow-spittle,</hi> by some a Meteor that falls from the Air, and is by them esteem'd poysonous, whereas indeed it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Froth form'd from the Plant, by this little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sect:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61347:92"/>
I have taken several of these, and clos'd them with some Plants in Boxes, so that they could have no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the Air, and the Day following they were all cover'd with this kind of Froth, which Experiment puts the Matter beyond Controversy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caterpillar</hi> deposites her Eggs in Cotton, in the Clefts of Trees, which are enliven'd by the influence of the Sun, at a proper season of the Year; I do think she is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd by her young ones, which creep within her to suck, for I have sometimes found them creeping upon Cabbages, with twenty young ones within them, and sometimes dead with these within their Bodies; they enter them at little Orifices like Nipples, on either side of the Belly, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times creep so far as to be scarce discernible, but most commonly one half of them hangs out. The <hi>Possum</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies</hi> is said after the same manner to convey and nourish its young ones, which are observ'd to run into an external kind of a Womb, in which they lodge whilst she endeavours an Escape: so various are the Methods w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Creatures have for the preservation of their Species.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Locust-Fly</hi> I have been inform'd has been found in <hi>Wales,</hi> but I remember not any to have been discover'd in these Parts. The <hi>Red Spider</hi> is very common, and is said to be that, which frequently poysons Cattle; of this I call to mind a remarkable Instance upon a <hi>Cow,</hi> which a Farrier asserted was poyson'd by this kind of <hi>Spider:</hi> The Beast was extreamly swell'd, and her Belly extraordinary hard, she lay moaning upon the Ground, doubtless in violent Pain, and past hopes of help; the Farrier however offer'd, if the Owner consented, to thrust his Knife in her Stomach, to put her out of Torment; the Owner complies, and the Farrier immediately enters in his Knife, upon which there instantly issued forth a Steam, which took Fire at the flames of the Candles, and blaz'd all over the Barn, and was with some difficulty exstinguish'd; the <hi>Cow</hi> suddenly rusht upon her Feet, began to eat, and afterwards grew
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61347:93"/>
perfectly well. How this sulphureous <hi>Halitus</hi> got into the Stomach, is not easily solved, and indeed it is a very odd Phaenomenon, but it is certainly the most probable that it proceeded from the sulphureous Particles of some Herbs she had eaten, for I cannot conceive, how any Insects she had swallowed could produce such Effects.</p>
               <p>Human <hi>Worms</hi> I have observ'd of various kinds, as the <hi>Cucurbitoe,</hi> so call'd because they resemble the Seeds of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbits,</hi> are joynted one into another, and hence are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to three or four Yards in length: Of these the learned Dr. <hi>Tyson</hi> has given a most exact Account, to whose Works I refer the Curious. The <hi>Ascarides</hi> are commonly seen, but how these are generated in the Stomach and Bowels, may merit our Enquiry: It seems probable to me that the <hi>Ova</hi> of Insects are either mingled with the Liquors we drink, convey'd thither by the Air, in which doubtless they continually float, and when receiv'd into the Stomach and Bowels, by the innate warmth of those Parts, are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually form'd till they arrive to their full growth: Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to their Formation may be the hatching of Eggs in <hi>Aegypt</hi> in Stoves, or by the heat of the Sun. Another way of Conveyance of these <hi>Ova</hi> into the Body, may be by the Roots, Fruits and Herbs, or even in our common Food, allowing first that the Generation of all Creatures arise from <hi>Ova,</hi> which we must necessarily espouse, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the origin of these <hi>Worms</hi> is inexplicable, for to assert that they proceed from a Putrefaction of Humours, is but a general Term, and indeed rather gives an account of the Effect, than the Cause.</p>
               <p>Of what we have alledg'd there cannot be a clearer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, than in the following Instance, as appears from the History of the <hi>Free-booters</hi> in the South-Sea in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> in the Year 1685. where in the Island of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> not many Leagues distant from <hi>Panama,</hi> they give us this Account: There are but four Months of fair Weather there throughout the Year, which are <hi>December, Ianuary,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61347:93"/>
February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> the other Months are incommoded with great Rains, which fall almost without intermission, and which, besides the <hi>Bloody-flux</hi> they bring, are so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, that if a Man has been wet with them three or four times, if he do not presently shift himself, there breed large <hi>Worms</hi> betwixt the Skin and the Flesh, in form somewhat like unto a Quill, and about a Finger long; whence to me it seems evident that the <hi>Ova</hi> of various Insects impregnate the Rain-waters, if so, it is easy thence to conjecture, how by the Liquids, Fruits and Aliment we take, <hi>Worms</hi> may breed in human Bodies. Against this Hypothesis there remains one material Objection yet to be solved, That if <hi>Worms</hi> in human Bodies arise from their <hi>Ova,</hi> convey'd thither in the Meats and Liquids we take, how comes it to pass that they are so usually form'd in Infants, who never tasted any thing but the Milk of their Parents or Nurses, a Nourishment that has pass'd the first digestions of the Stomach and Bowels (where the <hi>Worms</hi> are most frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nested) and separated from the Blood in the Breast by the Glands, and other Vessels adapted to that purpose? To this I answer, That the <hi>Ova</hi> of <hi>Worms,</hi> and several Insects, are as small as the Globules of the Chyle, and may conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mix with the Blood, by the same Ducts the Chyle does; if this be granted, 'tis no difficult matter to assign a Reason how <hi>Worms</hi> are generated in the Stomach and Bowels of Infants, for the <hi>Ova</hi> are thence carried along with the Milk, and lodg'd in the Stomach and Bowels of the Child. To illustrate this the subsequent Instance will be very necessary: In the Year succeeding the great Frost, I frequently took notice of little white <hi>Grubbs</hi> lodg'd within the Pippins of several Apples, like those in the Kernels of Nuts, tho' the Skin and Pulp of the Apple were entire without the least Perforation. Now, I say, considering the minuteness of the Vessels that convey nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment to the Kernels of the Apple, which are much smaller sure than those that bring Milk to the Breasts in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61347:94"/>
human Bodies; by the same parity of Reason we may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that the <hi>Ova</hi> are introduc'd into the Body of the Infant, by the Chyle W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it receives from the Breasts. But perhaps it may be objected, if the various substances of Creatures are included in <hi>Minimis</hi> in their distinct Seeds, what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity is there for these <hi>Ova?</hi> To this I reply, Tho' <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pighius</hi> and <hi>Lewenhoeck</hi> have discover'd <hi>Animalcules</hi> in the Seeds of divers Animals, and in a late Transaction, in human Seed there are delineated different growths of them, that altho' I should grant this, yet I affirm that these <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malcules</hi> could never arrive to Perfection, until they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited in their proper <hi>Ova,</hi> and there they receive their Nutriment; and this is not only evident in Insects, but even in Fishes, Birds, Quadrupedes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Mankind it self.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Frogs</hi> they generate in Eggs, the first formation of the <hi>Foetus</hi> is in a black Speck, adhering to the <hi>Ovum,</hi> after they are enliven'd, they have long small Tails, and are then call'd <hi>Bull-heads;</hi> in a little time this shapeless Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering is thrown off, and their perfect shapes are disclos'd, they have a peculiar <hi>Membrana Nictitans,</hi> with which they cover the whole Eye, which preserves them from the points of Reeds, Rushes and Prickles, which otherwise might injure them; they will lie with their Lungs expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a long time, squeezing out the Air by degrees, and so it is they continue under Water so long; at a certain time of the Year they have a <hi>Membrane</hi> which closes their Mouths, it is wonderful how long a time they sleep in the Water, without any Food, their Mouths being still clos'd by this <hi>Membrane;</hi> but <hi>Iacobaeus,</hi> a <hi>Danish</hi> Physician, assures us, that they have two peculiar Vessels, which carry nothing but Fat, which he imagins nourishes them in that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, but this being spent, the Blood grows sharp, and then by its Irritation they immediately awake. In Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Cases the young ones are frequently made use of in <hi>France,</hi> and, as I have been often told by the Inhabitants
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61347:94"/>
of that Country, with great Success; I do judge that for the same reason that <hi>Snails</hi> are prescrib'd in those Cases, these may be also, both of 'em consisting of a viscid <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilage,</hi> which probably may sheath the acid Salts of the Blood, which in the first place coagulated the <hi>Serum,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the <hi>Lympha</hi> into a Size, as may be frequently seen upon the surface of the Blood taken from Consumptive Persons, and so having reduc'd it to that cross Consistence, it is very probable that it may raise Obstructions in the Lungs, whence ensue <hi>Nodes, Tubercles,</hi> and at last <hi>Impost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humations,</hi> many of the small Bladders of the Lungs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing distended beyond their natural tone, and at last break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one into another. There is a Water distill'd from the Spawn of these, frequently (and with success likewise) us'd in <hi>Spitting of Blood,</hi> for which, in some measure, the same Cause may be assign'd, as in the former Case. But I have often wondred, why Plaisters of these are so frequently prescrib'd in most of the scrophulous Cases, not only in our own Dispensatories, but in forreign likewise; but it may be, that in the Mucilage of these there may be invelop'd vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile alcalious Salts, that may destroy those Acids in the Blood, which so incrustate the <hi>Serum,</hi> that it obstructs the Glands, and so makes 'em scrophulous: This I rather surmise, because I know by repeated Instances, that from the Mucilage of several Plants (whose Virtues have been always suppos'd to consist in that, because 'tis easily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared from them) a Volatile alkalious Salt may be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; and if it be so in a Vegetable, why not in an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal likewise? There only remains one Observation more relating to this Creature, upon which I shall descant a little, and then not trouble the Reader further; and that is to shew what that Substance is which is vulgarly call'd <hi>Starr-Slime,</hi> whether the <hi>Frogs</hi> spawn, as some imagin, or a Meteor that falls from the Air, as others alledge, or lastly a Body that arises out of the Earth: And these I shall examine in their several order. That it is not the Spawn of a <hi>Frog,</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:61347:95"/>
is evident from the subsequent Argument, because it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently found in those seasons of the Year in which the <hi>Frogs</hi> do not spawn, as in Winter; nor does it seem probable that it should be a Meteor, because I do think that no Man can Experimentally aver, that he ever saw such a Substance fall from the Air upon the surface of the Earth, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in some Generation would have happen'd, had the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of it been in that manner; it remains therefore in the last place, that we conclude it to be a Mucilage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising out of the Earth, which is usually in low moist Grounds; and what is said in relation to this, may in a great measure be apply'd to that Substance vulgarly call'd <hi>Faries Butter,</hi> both of which, as I suppose, may in small portions be rais'd by a subterraneous Heat, but successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condensed into that Body in which we find 'em, by the intense coldness of the ambient Air.</p>
               <p>Having finish'd my Observations in reference to <hi>Frogs,</hi> I shall in the next place proceed to what I propos'd, and that is, to make some Remarks upon the <hi>Toad.</hi> As this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (like the <hi>Viper)</hi> contains one of the greatest Poysons in the Universe, so (like that also) it supplies us with the richest Cordial. I have in the late pestilential Fever seen repeated Instances, which demonstrate the truth of these: In a low vermiculating Pulfe, so call'd from the analogy it bears to the creeping of a <hi>Worm,</hi> (a melancholly Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphic, to shew a Man by what Reptile he is just a hurry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be devour'd) by giving plentiful Doses of a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der prepar'd from these, many have been snatch'd from the very brinks of Eternity. Nor has it less frequently in more lingring and tedious Distempers afforded us an easy and a large Reprieve, I having by the repeated taking of this Medicine in Hydropic Cases, seen the Lives of many for several Years protracted; so that as in the former Case it saves us from perishing by the scorching heat of a Fever, so it does in the latter likewise keep us from sinking in the Waters of a Dropsy. The Tast of it (if rightly prepar'd)
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61347:95"/>
is a little Acid, which I take to be the Effect of a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile, alcalious Salt, and it is I presume in these Cases by attenuating the viscid <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces these wonderful Effects. I have been lately inform'd by Persons of great Learning, as well as Integrity, that in the Fever before recited, large Doses of <hi>Laudanum</hi> have effected the same thing, a Practice modern to what has been formerly laid down; but the reason of the giving of this in so large quantities, was grounded in a great measure upon Experiments try'd with a solution of <hi>Laudanum,</hi> by injecting it into the Mass of Blood, which was always found to make it fluid; and if so, to me the Method seems rational. Some Years ago I laid down some Arguments in the Exercitations I printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> accounting for the Cause and Cure of that Distemper, from which it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, beyond contradiction, that the Mass of Blood in that Distemper is coagulated; and this may fully hint to us what I shall afterwards make out, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Opium,</hi> by its acrid Salt making the Mass of Blood too fluid, becomes poysonous, or else because the Points of this too much contract the <hi>Fibrillae</hi> of the Brain, and so obstruct the separation of the animal Spirits; it is not to be imagin'd that by crass faeculent Particles it should effect these Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, since it is abundantly known to be a most noted Diaphoretick, and consequently a Medicine whose Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients are volatile, and 'tis therefore, I doubt not, that in the <hi>confluent Pock</hi> it is of that extraordinary use, <hi>viz.</hi> by attenuating the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood, which was almost converted to a putrid <hi>Pus.</hi> Much more might be added in relation to this, but I hasten to some other Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and so shall close this Chapter; and those are chiefly concerning <hi>Butter-flies, Bees, Hornets,</hi> and the <hi>Heminens,</hi> or the <hi>American,</hi> or <hi>Humming Bird.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Butter-flies,</hi> by the ingenious and industrious Mr. <hi>Iames Pettifer</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> as to the Descriptions of them are rang'd into that accurate Order, that it would be but
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61347:96"/>
superfluous to add any thing in relation to that Matter; wherefore since the Preparation from 'em yield us not any thing material, and their Generation having been fully accounted for by others, I shall pass 'em over; as likewise the <hi>Bees,</hi> their Government, Generation, Stings, and Honey, having been before accounted for by so many various and learned Hands; however I shall make some few Remarks, by what a wonderful, but natural Chymistry they elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their Honey, and how tho' seemingly dead, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, and lastly the difference betwixt them and the <hi>Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens.</hi> So wonderful is the structure of the Organs of these Insects, and so differently modify'd, that the various Juices which they suck and extract from Plants, that the greatest Bitter they convert into one of the sweetest Extracts, and the rankest of Poysons into one of the most balsamic Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; with what little reason therefore do some so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently inveigh against our Chymical Preparations, as not safe or agreeable to human Constitutions, since we see one of the meanest of Insects does so fully evince the contrary. Can I see that Creature imbibing the Juice of the most poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous Vegetable, and converting it to a safe and a palata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Medicine, and not allow to Man, that he shall with all his exalted Reason, be able so far to correct the Poyson of a Metal or Mineral, that it shall become a safe Medicine? Surely he that of human Kind has these Apprehensions, either wants a publick Genius, to exert its Faculties for the good of Mankind in general, or that he has a mind to rest satisfied in the ignorant Traditions of his Ancestors, and at last be entomb'd in <hi>Cimmerian</hi> Darkness.</p>
               <p>I shall now in the next place assign some Reasons how after being seemingly drown'd in Water, or suffocated by the steams of <hi>Brimstone,</hi> they will revive. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Air is not convey'd into the Bodies of these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects, either by the Mouth, or any Nostrils, they not being supply'd with Lungs, but has its admission thro' the Pores of the Body; if these therefore either be impleted with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61347:96"/>
Water, or their Orifices pursed up by the Restringency of an Acid, as in that of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> it is then that the <hi>Bee</hi> lies as if dead, the animal Spirits in her wonderful Vessels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing depriv'd of a fresh supply from the Air, but as soon as the humid Particles are either scatter'd by the heat of the ambient Air, or that the Orifices of their constringed Pores recover their natural tone, it is then, if the Spirits expand themselves again, that this Insect seems, as it were, re-animated. The <hi>Heminens,</hi> or <hi>Humming Bird,</hi> tho' it seems to ply about a Flower, after the same manner as the <hi>Bee,</hi> and has a <hi>Proboscis</hi> like that of a <hi>Bee,</hi> and is much about the size of the largest of that fort, yet this Creature never produces Honey, and the reason I take to be this, because that Bird has <hi>Viscera</hi> and Bowels like other Birds, which the <hi>Bee</hi> has not, and therefore the Digestions being different, so must the Effect be likewise. The Sting of the <hi>Hornet</hi> and <hi>Bee</hi> are fully accounted for by others, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall close this Chapter.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Birds.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THESE Counties afford us great variety of Birds, and in some places even clog the Inhabitants with their Plenty. Amongst the rest, the <hi>Barnacle</hi> being very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the manner of its Generation having been a Matter of Controversy, I shall recite my Observations upon it, and endeavour to reconcile that Point. It is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of our Ships which Trade to the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> that upon their return home, an infinite number of small Shell-fishes often adhere to them, at the first view not much unlike young <hi>Geese;</hi> these for several Ages have pass'd for <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,</hi> not only amongst the Vulgar, but Men of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewise, wherefore to set things in their true Light, I shall in the first place give the Anatomy of this Shell-fish
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61347:97"/>
resembling the <hi>Barnacle,</hi> and afterwards that of the real Bird, and then lay down some Reasons to shew the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of their being bred after the manner formerly receiv'd.</p>
               <p>This Shell sticks to the outward Planks of Ships by a glutinous Matter, it resembles the Head of a <hi>Goose,</hi> to which there is a Neck annex'd, yet this Neck is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted to the Body, but terminates immediately within the Shell, whence it is impossible that this should be the <hi>Barnacle</hi> in <hi>Embryo.</hi> Within the Shells are Claws, with Hairs like those of <hi>Lobsters,</hi> wound within one another in spiral Lines, and are not very unlike the Wings of a <hi>Goose,</hi> but these I found to be perfect Shells, and not Quills or Feathers; whence it is plain, that they could not appertain to the <hi>Barnacle,</hi> that being of the Feather'd Kind. These Shell-fishes are observable upon several Sea-weeds in the Gulph of <hi>Florida,</hi> and are there chiefly pick'd up by our Shipping: I never yet could meet with any Seaman who could affirm that he had seen any fall from Ships, and swim, which must have necessarily happen'd, had they been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into <hi>Barnacles;</hi> besides, in the Anatomy of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,</hi> I found them (as other <hi>Geese)</hi> Male and Female, the one having a <hi>Penis,</hi> the other <hi>Ovaria,</hi> whence it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that their way of breeding is no wise different from that of other Birds; what therefore has been asserted by <hi>Speed</hi> and others concerning this Bird, is only a vulgar Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and they only wanted a thorow Enquiry, to give them satisfaction in this Matter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sea-Crow</hi> is a Bird common in these Parts upon the Sea-Coasts, the shape of it is like that of other <hi>Crows,</hi> and it only differs from them in Colour, the Head and Wings being black, and the Body blue; its Food for the most part are <hi>Muscles,</hi> and I have often with admiration ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd these Birds to peck up Pebble-stones, and then to soar with them in the Air to a considerable height, then to let fall the Stones amongst the Beds of Shell-fishes, which
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61347:97"/>
most commonly break some of them, they afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and feed upon their Prey. These Fowl are said to breed in the <hi>Isle of Man,</hi> but are not used as Food.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Puffin</hi> is a Bird about the bigness of a <hi>Duck,</hi> and sometimes is seen in these Parts, they are generally extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary fat, and when Pickled are relishing Food; this Bird breeds likewise in the <hi>Isle of Man,</hi> in a Place common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call'd the <hi>Calf of Man,</hi> in little Cells within the Rocks, and it is observable when they have young ones, that they take their flights to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Shores, and there fish for small Fry; when their Stomachs are full, they return and eject their Prey for the nourishment of their young: so endearing and indissoluble an Affection is imprinted on all Creatures for the preservation of their Species.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Asper</hi> is a species of the <hi>Sea-Eagle,</hi> and is sometimes observ'd in these Parts; its Food is upon Fish, one I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sected, and in its Stomach I found a great number of small Fishes, some entire, some half digested, and others turn'd to a perfect Mucilage; in the Coates of the Stomach I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd several tubular Glands, which by compression would emit an insipid kind of <hi>Lympha,</hi> which with any kind of Alcaly or Acid, would not cause any fermentation, and yet the Fishes that lay in that part of the Stomach were either thorowly digested, or had half ways arriv'd to it. From which Phaenomenon it is evident, that this Liquor is the ferment of the Stomach in these kind of Birds, and that Digestion is not always perform'd by Acids, (as some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,) nor by Alcalies (as others) but indeed by an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable mixture of both these united with several other Bodies; of which, <hi>Steno</hi> speaking of the <hi>Saliva,</hi> has this Expression, <hi>Nihil invenies, quod illa respuet, nihil cui sine pugna non associetur.</hi> If therefore we can but content our selves, in having the satisfaction to know how to correct too prevailing an Humour in this wonderful Mixture in a Morbific State, it is as much as relates to the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind; I think I may affirm, that all we can
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61347:98"/>
attain to from all Hypotheses hitherto form'd about Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, falls infinitely short of that universal <hi>Menstruum,</hi> whatever the <hi>Adeptist</hi> may pretend, he only amuses us with obscure and <hi>Utopian</hi> Preparations, and gives us the Cloud to grasp at: But here Nature plentifully distributes, what he only imagins, and without torturing us with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful Flames, by Methods easy to her self, tho' un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us, she prepares the true <hi>Alkahest,</hi> or <hi>Universal Dissolvent.</hi> How trifling then is it to affirm this to be a <hi>Sal. Volat. Oleos.</hi> as a late Author has done; for if so, how comes Digestions of Bones and Metals to be perform'd in the Stomach? no such Phaenomenon ever was effected by the preceding Liquor hitherto prepar'd by any Man: why then should that be the universal <hi>Menstruum</hi> of Nature, set up meerly to support a tottering Hypothesis? Or why should we frame Schemes of Matters, which are not really what we fancy them, but what we could only wish them to be? And thus by an over-weening Affectation of our own Conceptions we lick our deform'd Offspring, imposing upon the World groundless and imaginary Ideas, for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Demonstrations. Others by <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alcaly</hi> will unmask all the dark Recesses of Nature, and make these two Combatants all the Ingredients of the Universe; but let these Men consider the wonderful structure of the meanest Vegetable, the unaccountable preparation of its Juices, the wonderful preservation of its Species, and they will then find <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alcaly</hi> to be too pitiful Principles to account for these admirable Phaenomena. Others with their <hi>Striate Particles</hi> presently set together all the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the six Days of the Creation, yet at the same time they cannot demonstrate the Properties of an equilateral Triangle. Thus we croud our Heads with unnecessary and false Ideas of Things, and neglect the most useful part of Learning, which is a true knowledge of the Properties of Bodies, so far as we can attain to it by Experimental Learning: But I fear I have made too long a Digression on
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61347:98"/>
this Point, and shall therefore proceed to what relates far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to this Head. As to the Oyl of the <hi>Asper</hi> so vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly famed for alluring of Fish, it is only a general Mistake, and in no wise answers the End.</p>
               <p>The next remarkable Bird is the <hi>Sparling-Fisher,</hi> it is about the Bigness of a <hi>Duck,</hi> and by a wonderful Activity in Diving catches its Prey, and yields a very pleasant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version when pursued by Water-Dogs. The <hi>Cormorant</hi> is common in these Parts, and in the <hi>Indies</hi> it is made use of to take Fish withal, the manner which they do it by is this: A Ring being fix'd about the lower end of the <hi>Oesophagus,</hi> its swallowing any farther is prevented, and then he is turn'd into the Water; when his Prey is caught, he returns to the Shore, and immediately ejects what Fish he had taken, and again pursues his Game: The Guts in this Bird have but small Circumvolutions, hence the Food which he takes passes so very quick, that he is almost continually hungry, which renders him more fit for this kind of Diversion. Not much unlike this is a Creature in <hi>Lithuania</hi> call'd a <hi>Ierfe,</hi> whose Bowels have no Windings, and so it becomes continually craving, and gorges until its Belly is distended like a Drum; and then gets betwixt two Trees, and presses forth the Foeces, and so returns with as eager an Appetite to its Prey as ever.</p>
               <p>Two White <hi>Crows</hi> I have seen in these Parts, One of which was Presented to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and kept as a Curiosity in the Park at St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s, the Present was made by that ingenious Gentleman <hi>Edward Tidesley</hi> of the <hi>Lodge,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr>. It is said in <hi>Russia</hi> and other cold Climes, that Birds and other Animals, which in the Spring-time are of a brownish Colour, in the Winter turn as White as Snow, which argues different Exaltations of the Sulphurs both in Hairs and Feathers. Of <hi>Moor-Game</hi> we have great Plenty, both of the Small, and the Black, they live upon Heath, but more particularly upon that part, which we call <hi>Erica,</hi> or <hi>Dwarf-Cypress;</hi> they afford us a pleasant Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61347:99"/>
and when caught they are delicious and healthful Food: The Description of these are so accurately deliver'd by Mr. <hi>Willoughby,</hi> that I thought it not worth the time to trouble the Reader farther.</p>
               <p>Of the <hi>Curlews</hi> there are Two sorts, the <hi>Curlew</hi> and the <hi>Curlew-hilp,</hi> these are the larger, and not very unlike the <hi>Woodcock;</hi> they frequent the Sea-Coasts, and are very good Meat. The <hi>Water-Hen</hi> is common in Ponds and Meers, but not much regarded, because esteem'd unpleasant Food. The <hi>Rale</hi> is a Bird about the bigness of a <hi>Partridge,</hi> and is common in these Parts, it hides it self in the Grass, and is discover'd by the snarling Noise, that it continually makes; it is very excellent Food, and doubtless of extraordinary Nutriment. The <hi>Quails</hi> are likewise common, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally extraordinary Fat, and eat delicately. The <hi>Rasor-Bill</hi> is sometimes observ'd upon the Sea-Coasts, so call'd from the similitude which its Beak bears to a Rasor, but this Bird is more common in the <hi>Isle of Man</hi> than here.</p>
               <p>The last Winter at a Place call'd <hi>Durton</hi> near <hi>Preston</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> I had a diverting Relation of a small Bird, in shape resembling, and about the bigness of a <hi>Water-wagtail,</hi> which was as follows: A Troop of Dragoons having been Quarter'd in that Town, some of the Soldiers were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly commanded to attend the Horses, it was in the Summer-time, and they generally lay, and repos'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the Grass: The Bird wou'd frequently fly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and make its approaches to their Bodies, and at length reach'd their Faces, and offer'd to their Mouths, what it had convey'd out of the Grass, and then would return and come and offer its Food as before; but what is most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable is, that the Bird wou'd not approach any Person but those in a Soldier's Habit, which was Red: This was confirm'd to me by several of the Soldiers, whom the Bird had attack'd in this manner; and likewise by a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Persons of undoubted Credit, who were Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of the Fact, so that the truth is not to be question'd:
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61347:99"/>
From this Passage many Conjectures arose, but that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Matter relating to <hi>Natural History,</hi> I shall not trouble the Reader with them; whoever pleases may make their Presages from this, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did of old from the Peck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chickens: However, 'tis probable that the Redness of the Habit might be to this Bird, as a Cloth of that Colour is a Lure to an <hi>Hawk,</hi> and here all their surprizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations may center.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sea-Gulls</hi> are of Two sorts, the Great and the Less, the Great <hi>Gull</hi> is near as large as a <hi>Goose,</hi> the Lesser about the bulk of a <hi>Partridge,</hi> they both live upon small Fish, which they frequently take up in the Shallows, and it is a very diverting sight to see them mount, and hover in the Air, spying out their Prey, which discover'd they strike instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Water, take it up in their Pounces, convey it to Shore, and there feed upon it; these Birds frequently pursue one another in their flights, and if in pursuit one <hi>Gull</hi> happens to Mute, the Excrement is frequently caught by the other, and swallow'd; it is my opinion, That oftentimes the <hi>Apous</hi> a Fish not wholly digested, may be ejected, which is the allurement of the Pursuer so eagerly to devour their Foeces: There are vast Quantities of these in the <hi>Isle of Walney,</hi> particularly in the Breeding-time the whole Island is near cover'd with Eggs, or Young-ones, so that it is scarce passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without injuring them; their Tast is very strong, and ungrateful, and therefore not much regarded.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sea-Pyes</hi> are very common, they are Birds of the Colour, and about the size of a <hi>Magpye,</hi> and are a very agreeable Food. The <hi>Red-shanks</hi> and <hi>Perrs</hi> are common likewise upon the Sea-Coasts, and are relishing Food. <hi>Wild-Ducks, Geese</hi> and <hi>Teal</hi> are very plentiful; but the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable thing of the <hi>Wild-Ducks</hi> is their way of feeding them at <hi>Bold</hi> in <hi>Lancashire:</hi> Great quantities of these Birds breed in the Summer-season in Pits and Ponds within the Demesne, which probably may entice them to make their Visits in the Winter; they oftentimes adventure to come
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61347:100"/>
into the Moat near the Hall, which a Person accustomed to feed them perceiving, he beats with a Stone on a hollow Wood Vessel, the <hi>Ducks</hi> answer to the sound, and come quite round him upon an Hill adjoyning to the Water, he scatters Corn amongst them, which they take with as much Quietness and Familiarity, as Tame ones; when fed they take their flight to the Rivers, Meers and Salt-Marshes. <hi>Swans</hi> are common in these Parts, but more particularly upon the Sea-Coasts, and upon <hi>Martin-Meer</hi> near <hi>Poulton</hi> in <hi>Lancashire:</hi> The <hi>Cygnet</hi> is very good Food, but the old Ones not tolerable.</p>
               <p>Sometimes there are Birds not common in these Parts brought hither by Storms (as was hinted before) particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly about Two Years ago, by a violent Hail Storm; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest there was a Bird all White (except only a short Red Beak) about the bigness of a <hi>Pigeon;</hi> and by what I observ'd of it, I cou'd apprehend it to be no other, than what our Travellers call the <hi>Tropick-Bird,</hi> met with usually in crossing that Line. The <hi>Kings-Fisher</hi> and <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hough</hi> are likewise common enough, as are the <hi>Fieldfeir</hi> and <hi>Woodcock,</hi> which visit us in Winter-time, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Northwards; they are said to breed in colder Climes, as in the <hi>High-lands</hi> in <hi>Scotland, Norway, Russia</hi> and <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and such like Parts: It is probable therefore, when those Countries are bury'd in Snow, and the Brooks and Rivers frozen up, that they take their flights hither. The <hi>Cuckow</hi> and <hi>Swallow</hi> leave us in Winter: the Opinions of some are, that they sleep during that Season, and they ground their Conjectures upon finding many of them in hollow Trees, and subterraneous Vaults; but why these may not as well pursue the Heat, as the other, is the Query: I have not dissected any of them taken from their profound Dormitories, so I pretend not to decide that Controversy.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>(a)</hi> The first Figure in the upper part of the Plate is a Man sounding a Flute upon the Stairs leading to the Hall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(b)</hi> The first Gate-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(c)</hi> A Man standing about 30 Yards from the first Gate-house, where observe that the Sound is not then discernible at the first Letter <hi>(a),</hi> from whence the Man sounds the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, but at the Letter <hi>(e),</hi> which is another Gate-house standing as describ'd in the Cut.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(d)</hi> Is a Man moving about 10 Yards nearer to the Gate-house <hi>(e),</hi> and then the Sound is not discernible from the Gate-house <hi>(e),</hi> as it was before, but from the first Letter <hi>(a)</hi> upon the Hall-stairs, where the Man is sounding the Instrument.</p>
               <p>These Phaenomena clearly demonstrate to us, that the Motion of Sound is undulating or waving, and not in direct Lines; so that the Sound being repercussed from <hi>(b)</hi> the first Gate-house, the Undulation from thence passes by the Man standing at <hi>(c),</hi> but is repercussed again from the Gate-house <hi>(e),</hi> from whence the Undulation of the Air being much greater, it there terminates at <hi>(c),</hi> and that is the <hi>Centrum Phonocampticum,</hi> or Center of Sound in that place: But the Man standing at <hi>(c)</hi> moving to the Man standing at <hi>(d),</hi> then the Sound vanishes from the Gate-house <hi>(e),</hi> but is very discernible from <hi>(a),</hi> where the Man is sounding the Instrument; and the reason is very obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, because the Undulation of the Air passes by him stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>(d),</hi> but is repercussed again from the Hall, from whence then it terminates at <hi>(d),</hi> which is the <hi>Centrum Phonocampticum,</hi> or Center of Sound in that place.</p>

               <p>THAT I might do justice to the Author of the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, lest I should in any wise mistake his Notion, or as I have express'd them, that they should not be thoroughly understood, I have for the Readers further satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, annexed to those the Cuts of the various Barometres, and shall explain the different <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which I observed in them: But the Reader must here be pleas'd to take notice, that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Name is not as is before asserted, <hi>Prideaux,</hi> but <hi>Iohn Patrick,</hi> who lives in <hi>Ship-Court</hi> in the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> near <hi>Ludgate;</hi> where any Person at any time may see the various Experiments.</p>
               <p>Fig. I. A Glass-Tube, weighing exactly a Pound, fix'd to the end of a Ballance, as described in the Figure.</p>
               <p>Fig. II. A pound Weight ballancing the opposite end of the Beam, so that the two opposite ends of the Beam hang now in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> that is they are equally Ballanced. To illustrate the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> observable in this Experiment, proceed in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Method.</p>
               <p>Fill the Glass-Tube with Mercury, afterwards immerse it in the Cistern, at the bottom of the Tube, as described in the first Figure containing Mercury, the Mercury then forms the Vacuity in the top of the Tube, and shews the Scale of the Weather for that time. Now it is that the Tube, and the Mercury contain'd in the Tube and Cistern, complete four Pounds. Hence it should follow, that four Pounds suspended at the opposite end of the Beam, ought to be an equal Ballance to the Tube Cistern, and Mercury suspended at the other end of the Beam, but quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Phaenomena</hi>'s are observable; for by only hanging two Pounds and five Ounces at the opposite end of the Beam, the Mercury contain'd in the Tube and Cistern, all of which weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four Pounds, are immediately boy'd up. Hence it is plain the Mercury contain'd in the Tube, does not gravitate upon the Mercury contain'd in the Cistern, for if it did, the two Pounds
<pb facs="tcp:61347:103"/>
suspended at the opposite and of the Beam, could not have boy'd them up, two Pounds being only half Ballance to four, it must therefore necessarily follow, that the Mercury in the Tube hangs pendulous from the Crown of the Glass, and becomes of no weight below, whence 'tis plain, the Quicksilver does not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend in the Tube by a pressure from the Quicksilver contain'd in the Cistern, for had it done so, it would then have follow'd, that as the external Air press'd upon the surface of the quicksil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the Cistern, and by that forced upward the Mercury in the Tube, that as the Mercury ascended in the Tube, the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance should have fallen lower, but a quite contrary Observation occurs, for as the Mercury ascends in the Tube, at the same time the Ballance rises also.</p>
               <p>Fig. II. In a Glass-Tube four Foot long, containing half a Pound of Quicksilver, without a Cistern, and the Mouth of the Tube wide open, the Column of Quicksilver, contain'd in the Tube, is about thirty inches, the Quicksiver in this Tube rises and falls 9 inches, and seven tenths prependicular, for fair and foul Weather, and presages the change of Weather very nicely; there are several other Tubes of a smaller size, which perform the same. This Tube hanging at the bottom of a Ballance, at whose opposite end was suspended a Weight which was an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libirum to the other, had the external Air forced up the Mercury in the Tube, it must thence have follow'd; that as the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury ascended, the Tube would have risen at the same time, but the contrary of this is very evident, for though the Mercury contain'd in the Tube, arise to the inches before mention'd, yet notwithstanding that the Tube never moves at all, which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation plainly Demonstrates, that the Mercury hangs pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the Tube, and only rises and falls according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Springs or Elasticities of the Air, contain'd in the top of the Tube.</p>
               <p>Fig. III. A Tube in the form of a Siphon, turned up 8 or 9 inches at the bottom, when filled with Mercury its ascent or descent is but one inch and a half.</p>
               <p>Fig. IV. Another Tube of the same form at the bottom, but at the top in the form of a Bicornu, or forked, which Branches
<pb facs="tcp:61347:103"/>
are about four inches long, the Mercury in this ascends three inches, which doubles the Scale to the former, which shews the ascent of the Mercury, is from the various Elasticities of the Air at the top of the Tube, and not from the pressure of the Ambient Air contain'd in the Cistern, add to these one Head more, the Mercury will then ascend one inch and a half higher, add two Heads it will rise three, and so on proportionably, which <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena,</hi> in my apprehension, amount to an absolute Demonstration of the truth of this Hypothesis.</p>
               <p>Fig. V. A plain Barometre, in this the Mercury only rises three inches.</p>
               <p>Fig. VI. A Bicornu, or forked Tube. In this the ascent of the Mercury is the same as in the other, which could not have been, had the Gravitation of the Ambient Air caus'd the ascent of the Quicksilver, since according to that Hypothesis, the Quicksilver in this should only have risen half an inch, since the Cistern of each only contain'd one Pound of Mercury.</p>
               <p>Fig. VII. A plain Tube open at the bottom, with a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of Mercury about thirty inches, in this the motion of the Quicksilver is very discernible at the top, before it is moved at the bottom, which plainly shews the ascent or descent of the Mercury, is from the Dilatation or Contraction of the Spring of the Air contain'd in the top of the Tube.</p>
               <p>Fig. VIII. By moving this Tube a little upwards, if the Air incline to a fair Temperature, the Mercury immediately ascends in that small Tube, but if to foul, as quickly subsides, but if upon that motion it neither moves upwards nor downwards, it shews the Air at that time to be of a setled temper. Let the Column of the Mercury be what it will, as for example twenty eight inches, when it rises to the top of the Scale, it will then compleat thirty one, which Observation fully Demonstrates, that the Mercury contracts and dilates three inches.</p>
               <p>Fig. IX. Shews the Mercury moving thirty inches upon the Declivity, this sort of Barometre shews the variation of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much more exact than any other. There is a Thermomete on the opposite side of it, and in the middle may conveniently be fixed a Looking-Glass. To these Experiments may be added
<pb facs="tcp:61347:104"/>
the following Observations, which may not only be diverting to the curious, but likewise may tend to the good of the Publick and perservation of the Mariners. It is Observable, that under the line, the Mercury scarce either rises or falls, except about two or three tenths, and will not stir while they continue there, the reason is, either that the extraordinary heat there, so rarifies the Air in the Tube, or that the Etherial Particles there, are so clog'd with the Rains of the Mosoons, that the Spring of the Air is very much weakened, and consequently therefore cannot elevate or depress the Mercury as in other Chines. But when you come into the Latitude of fifteen degrees, either North or South, the Mercury then will rise and fall an inch, when in thirty degrees it rises two inches, when in forty five it rises then full three inches, when in sixty degrees Latitude, it then shortens and returns to two inches, in seventy five it shortens to an inch, in eighty one it neither rises nor falls a quarter of an inch. By an accurate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of these, when rough tempests, and interposing Clouds prevent the taking of an Observation exactly, the Mariner may easily see in what Latitude he is in, and by that means may perhaps by observing his Compass at the same time, to let him see whether he is North or South; may not only frequently make his Voyages in a much shorter time, but likewise preserve his Cargo. Which if throughly pursued, will not only be of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinay use but Diversion also. Those Barometres were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the said Mr. <hi>Patrick,</hi> who is willing both to shew them to the curious, and supply any Person with them; and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks when both interest and pleasure Prompt to a through Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of the Experiments, it cannot be reasonably thought that a suitable encouragement should be wanting. It is further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that in those hot Climes, though the motion of the Mercury is so little, that in the variation of the Weather it cannot but with great difficulties be observed; yet by his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rometre, shewing the motion of the Mercury upon the Declivity, by having an account of the Latitude of the place, he adapts his Barometres to it, by which the different motions of the Mercury are as discernible as in different Latitudes.</p>

Is one side of a terrene course <hi>Fluor</hi> or <hi>Spar,</hi> found in the Mines in <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> in which are very discernible those Bodies which we commonly call the petrify'd Bones of Fishes of various sorts, some like the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of a <hi>Flounder,</hi> and the horizontal Bones branching with 'em; it contains also very lively representations of Feathers, Skrews, Stars, pieces of Shells, and the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of Reptiles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fig.</hi> 2. Is the Reverse of the same <hi>Fluor,</hi> in which are very discernible those Bodies which we commonly call petrify'd <hi>Cockles, Oysters, Pectunculi, Patellae,</hi> the <hi>Nautilus</hi> (which is observable near the lower Verge of the Figure) resembling in a great measure a <hi>Crescent;</hi> various Bodies like the <hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae,</hi> or <hi>Entrochi, Snails,</hi> representations of Stars, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious striated Figures; pieces of the <hi>Capsulae</hi> of Insects, like those of <hi>Butterflies;</hi> there are also some Figures resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the half part of a <hi>Worm,</hi> besides various Bones of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral small Fishes, and all petrify'd, or perfect Stone. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in these the Disports of Nature are very remarkable, and to me it seems very evident, that they are but the various Contextures of Salts, Sulphurs and Earths, and not the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of Creatures deposited there by specific Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity at the Deluge, when the Earth was universally dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as an eminent Author affirms; since this <hi>stratum</hi> of Earth contains all those different Bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> Salts, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs and Earths, the various mixtures of which shew us diverting Representations, as will be observ'd in other Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; so that he who contends for these to have been the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of those Creatures which they represent, must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise account for the Figures of Feathers and Stars obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in the same <hi>stratum,</hi> which I do conjecture is not easily done, taking the whole Matter together.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Fig.</hi> 3. Are two pieces of <hi>Marle</hi> petrify'd by the Sea-Water near <hi>Rossal</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> which shelves from those

Hills call'd <hi>Hagbur-Hills,</hi> where the Sea-Water frequently overflows, and in 7 Years time converts the Marle into a Grit or Free-stone, which is used by the People in Building, and is (I am very well assured) the best sort of Stone that can be made use of. Of this I saw an Instance in a convenient Pile of Building (commonly call'd <hi>Fox-Hall)</hi> belonging to <hi>Thomas Tildesley</hi> of the <hi>Lodge,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr>. The small Figure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two pieces of Marle, is a Shell which the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists stile a <hi>Buccinum,</hi> the two Cavities delineated in the Marle, are the <hi>Capsulae</hi> in which the Shell was included, but not petrify'd. Surely therefore were those different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations of Shells in Rocks, the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of Shell-fishes, this Shell ought also to have undergone the same Transmutation, since the Marle in which it was found, was converted into a perfect Stone; but since it hath not, till more conclusive Arguments are offered for that Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, I cannot but adhere to what I formerly asserted, <hi>viz.</hi> That the representations of Shells in Rocks are but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Concretions of Sparrs, Salts, Bitumens, and terrene Particles. The most remarkable Instance which I have seen of those kinds of Petrifactions, was indeed at <hi>Gresham-College,</hi> which was a stony Figure, and as I remember, of a gritty substance, representing that Shell-fish call'd by the Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists the <hi>Nautilus,</hi> or the <hi>Sailor,</hi> because it is said of this Fish, that like the <hi>Carvel,</hi> (which is constantly observed in the Voyages to <hi>Virginia)</hi> it will put its Body into that Posture, that it will sail with the Wind, and thence doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less had the Denomination of <hi>Nautilus,</hi> or the <hi>Sailing Fish.</hi> 'Tis affirm'd likewise of the same Fish, that there runs a Grit quite through the Body of it, by which it can dive or sink it self at pleasure, and so preserve it self, when pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued. Were this a Petrifaction of the real Fish, it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less one of the greatest Rarities in the World, that being an <hi>Indian</hi> Fish.

               <head>An Explication of the Cutts contain'd in the Sixth Plate, mark'd <hi>Tab. VI.</hi> relating to <hi>Pooles-Hole</hi> in <hi>Derbyshire.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THESE perhaps, are the most amazing Vaults in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse that are Natural and not Artificial. These describ'd in this Plate are <hi>Pooles-Hole</hi> and <hi>Elden-Hole,</hi> the most terrible Chasm that I ever yet beheld: How therefore these Cavities came to be formed in these Mountains is the next Thing to be enquired into. It is very probable that these Cavities have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in those unpolish'd Mountains ever since that terrible Deluge, so fully before discoursed of, and in my Sentiments abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely demonstrates the Veracity of it; for so far as I am able to conceive, it is not in the Power of Humane Understanding to give any rational Account of those prodigious Cavities, but either by Earthquakes or that general Inundation; but since there is no Historian that gives an Account of any such Earthquake in this Island, and that by the Experience of those which have happen'd in all preceding Ages in these tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Climates, we may reasonably suppose there never were any such. I adhere therefore to the latter <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> and do sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that at that Universal Destruction, the Strata of the whole Globe were broke asunder, most of them lying in a shelving or dipping Posture, as in all the Quarries we find at this Day they do; it is probable therefore that they tossing to and fro in the Flood upon the receding of the Waters, most of these Strata lying shelving, sometimes Two opposite Summits convened and in that terrible Confusion wedg'd themselves together, and by that means might easily form those prodigious Arches and Cavities which in our Days we observe in these Mountains.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61347:118"/>
These <hi>Phaenomena</hi>'s, if I mistake not, absolutely evince the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality of a Deluge, but on the other Hand as clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that the World was not then converted into a Fluid; for had the Globe then been an Universal Fluid, and all Things subsided by Specific Gravity, as Dr. <hi>Woodward</hi> affirms, there being no empty Space in the Fluid, as all Philosopers averr there was, was it possible that ever such Cavities could have been formed? I am certain, if it was so, whoever considers the Immensness of these void Spaces, must needs acknowledge that the Fluid then retain'd the most prodigious Pores that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it did since the Creation. This Cavity entertains us with several very diverting Objects, which shall be accounted for in their Order: And, indeed, considering the great Diversity of Figures that may be observed in the different kinds of Sparrs in these Places, and the great Affinity the Substance of the Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaster Sparr has to that of petrify'd Shells by the different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening of these, does it at all seem difficult to me to imagine how in those Mountains those Mineral Shells are frequently found? But I must own they are sometimes so extreamly like those Shell-Fishes which they represent, that to a vigorous Fancy they afford Subject sufficient to write ingenious No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.</p>

From these Instances it is very demonstrable that the Globe at the Deluge was not dissolv'd, for had it been then a Fluid, that Bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Matter in which the Plants are delineated could not have taken an Impression from the Rock, since according to that <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> the Rock at that time must be a Liquid also; and consequently therefore could not give an Impression to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen. The Observation may be further illustrated by a very familiar Instance: Let us suppose an Impression made upon Wax by a Signet, take another Piece of Wax, and by the Heat of a Flame reduce it to a Fluid, apply this to the Wax that has the Impression upon it; 'tis true, indeed, the Heat of the melted Wax will likewise turn the other Fluid, but at the same time it erases the Impression; so that it is plain, that had the Rock been then a Fluid, it could not have given an Impression to the Bitumen, unless you will imagine the Rock both above and under the Bitumen, to indurate before that which is both Chimerical and Absurd.</p>

The next Thing to be enquired into, is whence in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Cavity these Subterraneous Rivers have their Origin: It is observable in several of the Mountains in <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> that at the Bottoms of the Mountains there are several Cavities, which the Inhabitants call <hi>Swallows,</hi> into these run several Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets of Water, but where the Water has its Exit is not known: It is therefore my Opinion, that in large Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous Cavities, as in that at <hi>Castleton,</hi> several of those Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets convening, it is from them these Subterraneous Rivers are formed, and am apt to think, that those Springs which issue out of the Mountains in such rapid Currents, as some near <hi>Castleton</hi> do, are from them also.</p>
               <p>From all these the wonderful Disports of Nature, are not only discernable, as is fully demonstrated in Minerals, Metals and Plants, but in Animals also; Why therefore some Persons should spin out such elaborate <hi>Hypotheses</hi> to amuse Mankind, when these <hi>Phaenomena</hi>'s may otherwise be familiarly enough solved, I cannot apprehend? But those Heads having been fully enough discuss'd before, I shall not therefore recapitulate, but shall desire each Person to make his Observations accurately, and weigh the Whole together; and could heartily wish some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of no mean Character, would not violently espouse <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses</hi> which are not warrantable, and not fly into violent Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions when they are not opposed in any thing, but what is not consonant to Experiments and Natural Observations. How these Gentlemen may resent these I am in no wise uneasie, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Opinions may be of themselves is not my Business to enquire into, but when from Persons of Learning, in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Experiments I fully try'd, I receiv'd no Answer but Opprobrious Calumnies and Supercilious Arrogance; let

            <head>The Author's Vindication of himself, from some Calumnies lately cast upon him.</head>
            <p>SO strangely Opinionative are some Persons, and fondly link'd to the Wild products of their own teeming Genius, that an Ocular Demonstration to these amounts not to a thorough Conviction; nay, so prodigiously over-weening of those are their Sentiments, it is so far from attaining of it, that against the most evident Truths they wilfully shut their Eyes; and fall into such extravagant Expressions, that they almost exceed the rudest Offals of <hi>Billingsgate,</hi> and that for no other reason, but because I do not, as they suppose, that at the Deluge the Globe was Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally dissolv'd, or, as some will have it, converted into a Pudding, and instead of Plumbs, was larded with Cockles, which are since petrified: Those Gentlemen may be assured, I shall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern my self with their Missionaries; but when they themselves judge it convenient to make a Reply that is material<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I shall then be at their Service. Some of these have indeavoured to traduce me, both at the Engravers, and the Press, but have, in some measure, been disappointed in their Expectations: They have indeed, out of their unexpected Candour, been pleas'd to acknowledge, that there was somewhat of Stile in the Work; but for that reason were pleas'd to allege, it was not my own; in Answer to that, I have only this to say, in Vindication of my Self, that in Composing the Work, I had not the least assistance from any Person whatever; and have not in any wise been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective to make my self so far Master of the Language that I write in, as to adapt my Expressions to the subjects that I treat off.</p>
            <p>How far these kind of Actions are reconcileable, either to Justice, Honour, or Learning, I freely submit to the common Censures of Mankind; nay, even to their own Sentiments. And would gladly be inform'd, by what unaccountable Methods
<pb facs="tcp:61347:125"/>
they have so totally Monopolized all natural Learning, that the freedom of thought shall not be allowable to another. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their wonderful assurance, I will once again venture to affirm, their Petrefactions, many of them, at least, are not so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitely like the Shells which they represent, but we may as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably suppose, that the Espousers of this Fiction, may be as much mistaken as the Bird which peck'd upon the Grapes drawn by <hi>Zeuxes:</hi> And am apt to think, that upon a serious Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the whole matter, The one will be found as starving an Entertainment as the other.</p>
            <p>'Tis true some of these Gentlemen have very choice and curious Collections of Natural Curiosities, and in their Collections of petrified Shells, as they term them, even out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strip all the Trophies of <hi>Caligula,</hi> when he made that vast Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection upon the Belgic Shore; but if these Gentlemen cannot be certain, that those Shells are the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of those Fishes they take them for, they do but impose upon their own Judgments, and only entitle themselves to a spurious Off-Spring; wherefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the many absurdities that inevitably arise from that Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis that Learning is built upon, I shall not expatiate upon them here, but leave the further disquisition of those matters to the Unbiassed Readers.</p>

They have all Four Horns, and some of them of an Extraordinary size, the Two Horns next the Neck, are erect like those of Goats, but larger, the other next the Forehead are curved, like those of other Sheep, whether or no these be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Species of Sheep, or perhaps might come at first by Goats and Sheep engend'ring together I cannot determine, their Flesh is agreeable enough, yet different from other Mutton, yet more
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61347:126"/>
resembling that than Goats Flesh; Not far from thence lies <hi>Lime-Park,</hi> belonging to <hi>Peter Legh</hi> of <hi>Lime,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> in which there are a great Number of Red-Deer, of which this is remarkable, that once a Year the Keepers drive them together upon a grass Plain before the Gates of the Hall, a thing, I believe, not practis'd upon these Wild Creatures in any other part of the World; The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful consent there is betwixt the Horns and Testicles of these Creatures is scarce to be imagin'd, as likewise their Yearly casting their Horns, it is most certain if these Deer be gelded before the Eruption of their Horns, they never produce any afterwards, and if before the usual time of casting them, they then never cast those they are possest of; which <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> to me seems to argue, that the principal occasion of casting their Horns is, that about Rutting time their Testicles are more pregnant than at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seasons, hence their Blood being raised to an higher Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nay indeed to so touring a Pitch that Nature it self is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most unhing'd, hence the Blood Vessels being distended beyond their Natural Tone, are uncapable to contain any longer, but are forcibly burst asunder, by the disruption of these, the Horns, which abound with them, are dispoiled of all possible Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Nourishment, by which means the Nerves are render'd Weak and Languid, the Horn consequently by its own Weight declines, and falls off; these Horns afford us in Chymical Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, an Oil, and a Spirit, which is indeed nothing but the Volatile Salt dissolved in Phlegm, and a Volatile Salt, which are all of them of Extraordinary use in Languors, and Convulsive Distempers, or in any Malady of the Nerves; It is affirm'd, by the Learned Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> in his Travels in <hi>Hungary,</hi> that in <hi>Servia</hi> where the Plague frequently rages, they find no better Antidote against it than Eating the Flesh of these Creatures, for which there may be this Reason, it is probable the Flesh of these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, contains a greater quantity of Volatile Salt than other Flesh may, by which means it becomes a more generous Food, and by a more than an Ordinary Volatilized Chyle, prevents Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of the Blood which causes that Pestilental Distemper, those Volatile Alkalies, destroying the other Saline, Acid par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61347:126"/>
that make the Coagulum; The Horns of these Creatures by their own Effluvia are Convertible into a Jelly, which is of great use to Emaciated Persons, and a noble Food to any, it may be it was from this Preparation that Monsieur <hi>Papin</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the first hint of his New Digester, by which he Converted Bones into Marrow by their own Effluvia, which I have seen frequently Experimented by that Excellent Chymist <hi>Christopher White</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> Operator in the Publick Laboratory of that most Flourishing University; it is affirm'd by the Huntsmen, that these Creatures when they find themselves Encompassed by the Dogs, and no possibility of escape, will weep most Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, a sight that to a Tender Spirit wou'd damp the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement of that days Recreation, so endearing a Principle is Life to all Creatures.</p>
               <p>In the Park near <hi>Mannor</hi> in <hi>Lancashire</hi> are spotted Deer; There are some of these likewise in <hi>Dunham-Park,</hi> belonging to the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Warrington</hi> in the County of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> In a Park near <hi>Bury</hi> in <hi>Lancashire</hi> are Wild Cattel, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sir <hi>Ralph Ashton</hi> of <hi>Middleton,</hi> these I presume were first brought from the high-lands of <hi>Scotland.</hi> They have no Horns, but are like the Wild Bulls and Cows upon the <hi>Continent</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> of which Monsieur <hi>Hennipin</hi> has given us a full account in his Travels up the River <hi>Mesashippi,</hi> upon the Banks of which great Herds of these are frequently seen Grasing, and are Hunted by the <hi>Indians,</hi> as the Deer by us; The defect of Horns in these Beasts brings into my Mind a very remarkable <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> of one <hi>Alice Green,</hi> whose Picture I have seen in <hi>Whalley-Abbey</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> this Woman had Two Horns which grew out at the back part of her Head, they grew backwards like those of Rams, and were about three Inches long, these she cast once in three Years, and had always intolerable pains before the Horns broke out, whence came this <hi>Lusus Naturae,</hi> or Praeternatural accident, is, I think, a <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> not to be accounted for, unless at the time of Coition some such Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Idea might then be imprinted on the <hi>Faetus,</hi> which is the most probable Conjecture I can make on this point, since we have several Instances of strange Impressions thus Effected, a Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61347:127"/>
one is mention'd in <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> where he tells us, of a Woman who Dreamed she was with Child of a Cherry-Tree, which made such a wonderful Impression upon the <hi>Faetus,</hi> that in the Palms of the Hands, instead of those Lines usual to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, were to be seen the Figures of the Leaves, and Boughs, and Cherries, several other accounts of this Nature might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, which wou'd too much swell this Chapter to recite them, I shall only insert one more which was upon a Woman near <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theral</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> this Woman when with Child was affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Fire, and upon the Body of the Infant, was very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable a Lively representation of Flames, this was Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to me by Dr. <hi>Parsons</hi> of <hi>Preston,</hi> and I am satisfy'd in the Truth of it; how these representations of things, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the things themselves, are caused by Ideas imprinted by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon thè <hi>Faetús,</hi> is in my Judgment a matter that may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of various Hypotheses, but not any that will amount to a Demonstration, for how is it solvable by any Rules of Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, that the <hi>Faetus</hi> which by a few Vessels adheres to the Womb of the Parent, that an Artery and Vein, which only carry and reconvey Blood to its subsistance, shou'd ever perform these ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> it is certain the <hi>Faetus</hi> has no Communication with the Mother any way, than only in the Chyle, which is sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the Glandules in the <hi>Placenta Uterina</hi> which cannot possibly be imagined to produce these effects, how therefore the motions of the Animal Spirits penetrate through all these recesses of Nature, so far as I am able to apprehend, surpasses human Conception, and is indeed only solvable by him who knows no Limits, but Acts according to his own Almighty Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: The Atheist here may have room enough for Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then let him tell us, how an Artery carrying only a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thoughtless Blood, and a Vein returning what is not spent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nourishment of the <hi>Embrio,</hi> let him tell us, I say, how by an Accidental concourse of <hi>Monades</hi> or Atomes, it is possible these things shou'd be effected; but since I am apt to think he cannot define me what thought is, he may here acquiesce, and needs not blush to acknowledge his Ignorance, but may conclude
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61347:127"/>
with the Royal <hi>Psalmist,</hi> that it is, <hi>the Fool hath said in his Heart, there is no God, and indeed only he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lancashire</hi> chiefly in these Parts is most remarkable for breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cattle, of a size more than Ordinary large, particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Burneley,</hi> and <hi>Maudsley,</hi> from which places I have known Cattle sold at extraordinary Rates, an Heifer sometimes amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Fifteen or Twenty Pounds, the ground they Feed upon is usually upon an Ascent, and the Grass shorter than in lower Grounds; The usual method is to buy Calves in those Parts, when they are about One Year Old, then by removing them to a more Fruitful Pasture, they arrive to a larger Pitch than usual; The like is Observable in Horses, and hence it is, that in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> they generally breed the best of that Species.</p>
               <p>Let us here add something concerning the Superfaetation of Hares, which though not always, yet is frequently observed, that in the <hi>Uterus</hi> at the same time, Young ones of different Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions are discovered, one perhaps no larger than a small Plumb, another about half its due size, and a third at perfect Magnitude, I have often seen here the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Birth, that is a Young one taken alive from the Doe rip'd open, preserved and nourished for a considerable time afterwards, <hi>Phoenomena</hi> not unlike to these Superfaetations, are observable in various Plants, especially the Orange-Tree, upon which are Blossoms, and Fruits of different growths at the same time. Let us enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Rationale of this, and in the first place consider, that these Creatures have frequent Coitions after Conception, and then why may we not easily suppose, according to our former Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis, that the <hi>Semen</hi> equally at one time, as an other, after it is injected into the <hi>Uterus,</hi> may be absorbed there by the Capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Arteries, and by them be convey'd, and deposited into the <hi>Ova,</hi> and cause a Faecundation, and since there are various <hi>Ova</hi>'s in the <hi>Ovaria,</hi> it does not at all seem difficult to me how Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faetation happens; But rather indeed wonder there are not the same effects in Female Human-Kind, the same circumstances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring; But some may object against this Hypothesis, and allege that impregnation is not performed by the <hi>Semen</hi> thrown by the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61347:128"/>
Mass of Blood within the <hi>Ova;</hi> But that only a Gas, or <hi>Aura</hi> of the Seed is by the <hi>Cornua</hi> convey'd to the <hi>Ova,</hi> and so produces Faecundation. But to these I answer, since with small Bellows at the end of the <hi>Tubes,</hi> I have frequently attempted to force on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Air within the <hi>Ovaria,</hi> but cou'd never effect it, and since the <hi>Ovaria</hi> are likewise involved in a double Membrane, I do not see how in the least that Hypothesis can be defended, but since the <hi>Cornua,</hi> or Horns of the Womb, convey the <hi>Faetus</hi> from the <hi>Ovaria</hi> thither, to assert too that they likewise carry the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> to them, to me seems very Preposterous; besides Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> assures us, he has often immediately after Coition, dissected the Womb and its <hi>Cornua,</hi> but never in those cou'd discover the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lict of the <hi>Semen,</hi> which probably he might have done, had it been only thrown there to transmit its <hi>Aura</hi> into those Organs, to convey it to the <hi>Ovaria;</hi> again, if we consider the suddain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition of Persons after Conception; The several Hereditary Distempers that attend many Births, as the Gout, Stone, Dropsy and Consumption, can we imagine how these causes shou'd be solved, unless we suppose the very substance of the Seed to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited in the <hi>Ova;</hi> for how an <hi>Aura</hi> shou'd ever bring these about to me is unaccountable; But if, as some defend, Faecundation is effected by <hi>Animalcules</hi> floating in the <hi>Semen,</hi> and that the <hi>Ova</hi> are only recipients to them, I wou'd then appeal to those Modern <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> that espouse this Doctrine, to solve the causes of Hereditary Distempers, and enquire of them if these small seminal Gentlemen, have not frequent fits of the Gout, and are not sometimes Hydropical and Consumptive: But how Rational this is to imagine, I leave it to the World to judge, but shall rather conclude my self, that the very substance of the Seed is deposited in the <hi>Ova,</hi> and that as that is tainted, so likewise is the <hi>Faetus,</hi> and hence Hereditary Distempers arise. But to return to the Hare, it is observable those bred upon Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasses, and Parts adjacent to the Sea-Coasts, are usually the swiftest, though of the smallest size; But this their Velocity may, I presume, proceed in some measure from their Diet, which as I have frequently found by dissection, is a short dry Grass,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61347:128"/>
and sometimes the Tops of Heaths, and Barks of Trees, which being excellent Antihydropics, may occasion the dryness of their Constitutions, and in some measure their swiftness, by absorbing the <hi>Serum,</hi> or watry Parts of the Blood, by which the Muscles consequently must have less pressure upon them, and doubtless the Lymphaducts are less numerous in these than in other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. As to their different Colours it is observable those in colder Climes, as in <hi>Russia,</hi> and the High-lands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> are White or Grey, but in other Countries they are of a Brown Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, these variations of Colours by the Chymists are solved by their Experiments on Sulphur, which by different degrees of heat turns White or Red, as it is more or less Exalted, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Down of these Creatures, abounds with a great quantity of Sulphur; I think the conjecture not irrational. Distempers most incident to this Animal are commonly in the Liver, which are Hydatides, or Blisters upon its Superficies, proceeding doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less from a Rupture or breach of the Lymphatick Vessels in that part, occasion'd by violent running, and afterwards the coldness of the Earth too suddenly closing the Pores, and Obstructing perspiration, hence those Vessels become distended beyond a natural Tone, and Burst; This Creature is highly commended by the <hi>Germans</hi> to be a Healthful, Noble, and Generous Food, particularly by <hi>Ab-Heers,</hi> of which in his <hi>Spadacrene</hi> you may see a full and large account. But before I close my observations upon Quadrupeds, I thought it not a miss to insert two Instances, they being not only unusual, but of great Importance, the first is of two Persons, who in a small Cottage near <hi>Bury</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> dyed of the small Pox, during the whole time of their Sickness, Two Cats for the most part lay upon the same Beds with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, in a little time after these Persons had Expired; Both the Cats fell Sick, with the usual Symptoms in the <hi>Apparatus</hi> of the small Pox, and so regularly proceeded to the State of Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Maturation, with <hi>Pustules</hi> exactly like those in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-kind; at last those subsided, and soon afterwards both the Cats dy'd. By this instance it is evident the small Pox is not a Distemper peculiar only to Human-kind; But why to Mankind
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61347:129"/>
more than other Creatures, is the next thing we are to enquire into? The Decision of this Question depends upon two Topics; The first is the particular Composition of the Blood in Mankind, differing from that in other Creatures, and consequently those not so subject to this Distemper; That the Blood in Human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind does differ from that in Quadrupeds, is evident from the different Proportion of muriatick, fixt, and volatile Salts, that may be obtained from it, and this probably may proceed from their variety of Food and Liquors, and for that reason, I think, it wou'd be highly worth the time of our Modern <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> to take an exact Proportion in each of those, and to observe the Distempers the most incident to different Creatures, as likewise those that are Carnivorous, and those that Feed only upon Plants, and distinguish them accordingly; its most certain, it is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Crasis in the Blood, when Man is disposed to receive this Distemper, some Persons I have known conversant with People in the small Pox, and yet Twenty Years afterwards have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves been infected and dyed of them, when therefore by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Crasis the Blood is so disposed to receive the Morbisick par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Air, partly taken into the Body by the intromitting Pores, and partly by inspiration, it is then by the various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions of these the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood is converted into a Poiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Ichor, which by its acrimony separates the <hi>Cutis</hi> from the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> and forms those Pustules we Name small Pox.</p>
               <p>A second reason why Man is peculiarly subject to this Distemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, may be the variety of the Orifices in the Miliary Glands of the <hi>Cutis,</hi> which doubtless in Mankind, are much different from those in other Creatures, it must therefore necessarily follow, that where there are not proper secretory Vessels to receive such parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Coagulations, those Creatures cannot, as Man, be alike sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to equal Distempers; These may suffice for a Decision of the Question propos'd, I shall therefore in the next place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the second Instance, and that is of a Mastiff-Dog; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Honourable <hi>Peter Bold,</hi> of <hi>Bold,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> this Dog still attended his Master in his Chamber, during a tedious Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, being a Consumption of the Lungs, after this generous
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61347:129"/>
Gentleman Expir'd, and his Corps removed, the Dog almost each moment enter'd the Room, making a Mournful, whining Noise, and prosecuted his researches for several days, through all the Rooms of the House, but in vain; He then retired to his Kennel, from whence he wou'd not be Courted, but refusing all manner of Sustenance, died there; of this I was an Eye-Witness, being through the whole course of the Distemper concern'd for that Honourable Gentleman; what some may Bogle at to call Reason, I know not, but, I think, a deeper Sense of Sorrow and Gratitude, cou'd not be shown in any Creature whatever. Which brings me in the next place to consider what the Philosophers call the Knowledge of Brutes, concerning this there are various Opinions, the <hi>Platonists</hi> did not seem to doubt of it, and for that reason when they defin'd Man, to distinguish him from other Creatures, only stiled him an unseather'd Animal.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> run into a wilder extreme, and were so ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly possess'd with the Opinion of the Souls of Brutes, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved there was a mutual Transmigration of Souls. And hence surely we cou'd not blame the Poet, when he says, the mighty Thunderer transform'd himself into a Bull. But however, tho' without question there is something of a Spiritual distinguishing being, that actuates the Body of a Brute by the assistance of the Animal Spirit; yet the before recited Hypothesis of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> in bringing their Souls upon the level with that of Man, I look upon to be groundless; since Man is the only Creature in the World that has a reflex thought, and can abstract from matter, and that has any Notion of a Deity; But alas! how imperfect wou'd that be, had not God, out of his Infinite goodness, been pleased to communicate himself to us by Revelation, as we may find by too many Instances amongst the poor <hi>Americans,</hi> who though they have Notions of a Being Infinitely Good, yet have likewise the same of one equally Bad; and therefore Worship one through Love, and the other through Fear. Knowledge in Brutes by the <hi>Peripatetics</hi> is stiled natural Instinct: But since they are not able to define what that is, it is only to explain an obscure Matter by one more dark. I shall therefore pass it by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61347:130"/>
as not material to this Subject. But the <hi>Cartesians</hi> Quadrupeds are looked upon as a most compleat Piece of Clock-Work, or <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomala,</hi> moved only as the Object makes an Impression on the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, but since these Creatures are certainly endued with Thought, and Memory, which can never be explain'd by Rules of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanism, that Hypothesis is but ill grounded; Nay, they are so far from explaining these two faculties by their <hi>Problems</hi> in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks, that they are at a full stop, even by those Rules. To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold to me the more easy instance of voluntary motion, <hi>Steno, Charleton, Borellus,</hi> and <hi>Crone,</hi> have made Ingenious Conjectures on this Point, yet are defective when they come to examine the main business on those Notions; <hi>Epicurus, Lucretius,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> refine, and explain, the Knowledge of Brutes, by Images, and Ideas, and these they make either Simple or Complex, and those imprinted upon the Organ by the Object, and thence it is through a long experience of those Ideas, they are able to think and distinguish, and in that, as they would have it, consists their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Now I wou'd only enquire of these Learned Gentlemen, a solution of one Question, whether or no these Ideas imprinted on the Organ, by the Object, be Material or Immaterial; if they allow them Material, it is impossible but by such a weight of matter, through the whole Series of a Creatures Life, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on the Organ, the Organ must unavoidably be too op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest even to distinguish at all: It is plain the Eye, for a small Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, may view the Sun, but by a pressure of its Particles upon it, it soon becomes dim, and undescerning; But to this they may reply, that an Impression on the Organ is made equally as that of the Effigies of a Signet on Wax; But this will appear as liable to absurdities as the former, for from the same object on the same Organ, still new Impressions must succeed, hence the Organ in a common tract of time, must necessarily be worn out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd, and consequently not be able to distinguish any thing; for doubtless if the Object cou'd at any time stamp any Impression or Idea, it must <hi>Caeteris paribus</hi> still do so, and then the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is unavoidable: But if they allege these Ideas or Images are Immaterial, then a Soul or Spiritual being follows e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61347:130"/>
in those Creatures, sufficient to actuate the Body, and be capable of some degrees of Knowledge; this allow'd, there is no occasion for these Images, or Ideas, for why should Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture produce any thing in vain; Beings without a necessity are never multiply'd: And now after all the Blaze that Elaborate Piece of Human Understanding has procured in the World, from what is observed, it is easy to learn, that it amounts to no more than trifling in Philosophy, and refining on the Godhead; and perhaps to too many unwarily caught, has been of pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous consequence; I have insisted the longer on this subject, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Book, though so Universally receiv'd, if rightly weigh'd, is no more than what Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> has before alleg'd; I shall therefore Examine his Hypothesis, that being the Basis of the former; Mr. <hi>Hobb</hi>'s Notion was, <hi>That all Beings were mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and that betwixt Matter and Nothing there was no distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> which notion, no doubt, gave hint to that great Man before mention'd to form his Ideas; how far Mr. <hi>Hobb</hi>'s Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis is consistent with reason, for the following Reason I sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Judgment of the World: In the first place let him tell me how Matter can think; if he be there at a loss, his Notion unavoidably falls; but to say it can, is only to assert Matter acting upon Matter, and then I would know what it is that judgeth of that action Thought, when it abstracts from all mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Objects; This cannot be supposed to be a being consisting of Matter, for then it could not judge of the Action for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons before alleged: It is true in Mathematical Argumentations we have not Ideas of any Beings, but what consequently we must suppose to be Material, for our apprehensions of them are under some determinate Figure, and so consequently Material, because that is a Quality, <hi>viz.</hi> Extension, inseperable from Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But since to form adequate Conceptions of immaterial Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, surpasses both our Intellects and Organs, it does not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow that there are not any such Beings, no more than since a Mathematician cannot by the Rules of Arithmetick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate why one Grain should become five hundred, which notwithstanding is obvious, and familiar enough. It is strange
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61347:131"/>
such absurdities should be put upon the World; methinks the Being that has no dependance upon the Pen I write with, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evinces me to the contrary: Not that I speak this out of a conceit of any mean performances of my own, but only that it is actuated by a Being independant from it, by which I am able to demonstrate I am a Rational Creature. I proceed next to Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>'s Hypothesis concerning the Souls of Brutes, which is, that they are an actual fire, I shall endeavour to examine his Reasons, and Conjectures relating to that Opinion, and then lay down some Arguments why it cannot be so; in order to which, I shall examine the various Species of Fires, and their different Pabulums, and shall then, from the Experiments he recites, see how far they are convincing upon that Topic: of Fires there are various sorts, but all of them may be reduced to these gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> Aerial, Terrestrial, or Animal, the Aerial ones are those of Lightning, shooting of Stars, flying Serpents, the twins <hi>Castor,</hi> or <hi>Pollux,</hi> called by the <hi>Spaniards Corps le Saint,</hi> and these frequently fix upon the Masts and Sails of Ships; the Seamen by their long continuance, or quick disappearance, will pretend to Prognosticate the future Weather, it is impossible from any experiment he cou'd make upon these in the Air Pump, that he shou'd form any Corollaries, and since these no ways refer to this business, I shall not farther enlarge upon them. The Experiments recited by the Honourable <abbr>Esq</abbr> 
                  <hi>Boyle</hi> and the Doctor, are upon common Fire in the Air Pump, which they found to extinguish as they drew out the Vitrous parts of the Air, and the same thing happening to Animals in the Air Pump, the Doctor hence concludes the Souls of Brutes to be an actual Flame; and had he lived to have seen the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> prepared from the Blood, I question not but his pregnant parts wou'd highly have improved that Notion; in answer to his Hypothesis I wou'd gladly know of any Man, whether it is possible Fire shou'd think, or that voluntary motion can be solved by that Element, when it is by the Laws of Nature confin'd only to one motion, and that is Ascension, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> Philosophically, and truly words it, <hi>as Naturally as the Sparks fly upwards,</hi> and these
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61347:131"/>
granted, it necessarily follows the Hypothesis is groundless, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in Brutes there is both Thought and voluntary motion, as is before sufficiently demonstrated; the next Hypothesis is that of Dr. <hi>Mayow,</hi> who supposes the Soul of a Brute to be a Nitro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aerial Spirit, and for that Hypothesis recites the same Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> does, for that of Fire, the same difficulties therefore lying against that Notion, as the Doctors, I shall not recapitulate but pass it over; these are the most remarkable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that have writ on this subject: I shall therefore in the last place, propose my own Sentiments on that Head, my Thoughts are, that in all living Creatures whatever, there is a Spiritual, immaterial Being, that thinks, and actuates them: To this some may reply, if so, where then is the difference betwixt Man and Beast? There Souls must be both equally immortal with sounds contrary to Revealed Religion. To those I answer, that these Creatures have only a lower degree of Reason, not comparable to that of Man, even as we can imagine ours to be Inferiour to the Intuitive Knowledge of Angels, their Allegations therefore on this account are Foreign to the purpose, but suppose I allow far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Almighty may Annihilate the Souls of these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, after Death; but whether he do or not, or in what future State they are like to be, since his Infinite Wisdom has not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended to Reveal his Actions so far to Mankind, does it at all concern me? And therefore I can easily conclude with the Philosopher, <hi>Quae supra nos, nihil ad nos;</hi> and it wou'd be much better to acquiesce in a modest ignorance, than disturb our selves, and amuse the World with these unaccountable <hi>Theorems.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus far accounted for <hi>Phoenomena</hi> preternatural in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, in the next place, I shall descend to give an account of Persons in these Parts, that have been Eminent for their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Inventions, in Natural Philosophy, or Mechanicks; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst these the Learned Dr. <hi>Pearson</hi> may justly be placed the first, witness his most Learned Exposition on the Creed, and his unanswerable piece <hi>de successione Patrum,</hi> which at this day is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in the Vatican it self, though he a Bishop of a different persuasion from him that presides there, and esteemed as Sacred
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61347:132"/>
as a general Councel, or any Authority of the most noted Father; For Learning likewise and Pious generosity, Bishop <hi>Smith,</hi> and Dean <hi>Nowel</hi> have immortaliz'd their Names, the former was one of the Founders of <hi>Brazen-Nose</hi> College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> the latter gave several Scholarships to it, which to this day are called the <hi>Nowellians,</hi> to these Men of Learning we may justly add Sir <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Leicester</hi> of <hi>Tabley,</hi> to whom the World owes a great deal of Thanks, for his History of the Antiquities of <hi>Buckley-Hunder'd,</hi> and I hope it may be Pardonable, though I add my great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father <hi>William Legh</hi> Parson of <hi>Standish,</hi> he was Tutor to Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> and Chaplain to <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Derby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to Pious, and Charitable Foundations, there are three very remarkable in <hi>Manchester</hi> in <hi>Lancashire, viz.</hi> a College, a Publick School, and an Hospital; The College was first founded <hi>Ann. Dom.</hi> 1421. By <hi>Thomas De la Ware,</hi> first Rector of the said Parish Church, and Brother to the Lord <hi>De la Ware,</hi> whom he succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Estate, and Honour, and then Founded a College there consisting of one Master or Keeper, Eight Fellows Chaplains, Four Clerks, and Six Choristers in Honour of St. <hi>Mary,</hi> St. <hi>Denis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and St. <hi>George</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> to whom the said Parish Church was formerly Dedicated: This Foundation was dissolved 1547, in the first Year of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. the Lands and Revenues of it taken into the King's Hands, and by him demised to the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> and the College House and some Lands, sold to the said Earl: The College was refounded by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who restored most of its Lands, and Revenues, only the College it self, and some of the Revenues, remained still in the hands of the Earl of <hi>Derby;</hi> it was also Founded a new by Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Ann. Dom.</hi> 1578. By the Name of <hi>Christ</hi> College in <hi>Manchester,</hi> consisting of One Warden, Four Fellows, Two Chaplains, Four Singing Men, and Four Choristers, the number being lessened because the Revenues were so, chiefly by the Covetousness and False dealing of <hi>Thomas Herle,</hi> then Warden, and his Fellows, who sold away, and made such long Leases, as cou'd never yet some of them be retrieved: It was last of all refounded by King <hi>Charles</hi> I. <hi>Ann. Dom.</hi> 1636. constituting therein One Warden,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61347:132"/>
Four Fellows, Two Chaplains, Four Singing Men, and Four Choristers, and incorporating them by the Name of the Warden and Fellows of <hi>Christ</hi>'s College in <hi>Manchester;</hi> the Statues of the same being drawn by Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Hospital was Founded by <hi>Humphry Chetham,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> that great Example of industrious improvment, and incorporated by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. designed by that bountiful Benefactor, for the Maintenance of Forty Poor Boys, out of the Town, and Parish of <hi>Manchester,</hi> and some other Neighbouring Parishes, but since then, it is enlarged to the number of Sixty, by the Governours of the said Hospital; the Boys are to be taken in betwixt the Age of Six and Ten, thereto be maintained with Meat, Drink and Cloaths, and at the Age of Fourteen to be bound Apprentices, to some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Trade or Calling, at the charge of the said Hospital, for the maintenance of which he endowed the same with the Yearly Revenue of 420 <hi>l.</hi> which is since improved by the care and good Husbandry of the Feoffees or Governours, to the Yearly value of 517 <hi>l.</hi> 8 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> they having laid out in the purchase of Lands, 1825 <hi>l.</hi> which was saved out of the Yearly income over and above the maintenance of the Poor Children, and others belonging to the said Hospital; wherein there are annually near Seventy Persons provided for. Within this Hospital, by the Bounty of the said Founder, is also erected a fair, and spacious Library, already fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with a Competent stock of choice and valuable Books, to the number of near four Thousand, and are daily encreasing with the income of 116 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> setled upon the same by the said worthy Benefactor, to buy Books for ever, and to afford a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Salary for a Library Keeper; there is also a large School for the Hospital Boys, where they are daily instructed, and taught to read, write, and keep Accounts.</p>
               <p>The Publick School was Founded <hi>Ann. Dom.</hi> 1519 by <hi>Hugh Oldham,</hi> D. D. and Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> who bought the Lands on which the School stands, and took the Mills there in Lease of the Lord <hi>de la Ware</hi> for 60 Years, afterwards, with the Bishop's Moneys, <hi>Hugh Bexwick,</hi> and <hi>Ioan</hi> his Sister, purchased of the Lord <hi>de la Ware</hi> his Lands in <hi>Ancoats,</hi> and the Mills upon <hi>Erkes,</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:61347:133"/>
and left them in Feofment to the Free-School for ever; which Revenues are of late very much encreased by the Feoffees of the School, who out of the improvments, have as well considerably augmented the Masters Salaries, as the Exhibitions annually al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd towards the maintainance of such Scholars at the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, as the Warden of the College, and the High-Master shall think requisite, and have besides, for some Years past, added a Third Master, for whom they have already erected a New, and convenient School, at the end of the other.</p>
               <p>Besides these publick Benefactions, and Endowments, there have been several other sums of Moneys, and annual Revenues, left and bequeathed to the Poor of the said Town, by several Persons, who are thereby, with the Charity of the present Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, competently provided for, without starving at home, or being forced to seek relief abroad.</p>
               <p>Let us do Justice to the Memory of the generous <hi>William Hulme</hi> of <hi>Broadstone,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> who has nobly added to the Benefactions of the publick School four Exhibitions; The Scholars are to be Batchellours of Arts, in the College of <hi>Brazen-Nose</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> these are to be elected by the Wardens of <hi>Manchester,</hi> the Rector of <hi>Bury,</hi> and Parson of <hi>Prestwich</hi> then Living, they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of value betwixt Twenty, and Thirty Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> each, but after the Death of his Lady, will advance to near Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Pounds a piece Yearly; and these they are to hold till they have commenced Masters of Arts, and I do believe they will then be the best Exhibitions in that University.</p>
               <p>The Town gives Title to an Honourable Family, <hi>Henry Mountague,</hi> being Created Earl of <hi>Mancester</hi> by King <hi>Charles</hi> I. <hi>Ann. Dom.</hi> 1625. which Honour is now possessed by <hi>Edward</hi> his Grand Child, third Earl of the said Family; This account was given me by my honour'd Friend the Reverend, and Learned Dr. <hi>Wroe,</hi> the Present Warden of the Collegiate Church at <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> within which Church, are inscriptions of some Eminent Persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:61347:133"/>
At <hi>Maclesfield</hi> in <hi>Cheshire</hi> was a College Founded by <hi>Thomas Savage</hi> first Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and afterwards Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> in which several of that noble Family, the <hi>Savages,</hi> are buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as also of the Family of <hi>Dunham,</hi> which from <hi>Hammon de Massy,</hi> By the <hi>Fittans,</hi> and <hi>Venables,</hi> came Hereditarily to the famous Family of <hi>Booth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After these Learned and Charitable Personages, let us rank o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Eminent for natural discoveries, of which these Countries have not been altogether Barren; The World owes a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Obligations to the great industry, and Knowledge of <hi>Richard Townley,</hi> of <hi>Townley,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> which will be the best understood by a recital of his own Experiments, and Performances.</p>
               <p>His Letter to Dr. <hi>Croon,</hi> touching the invention of dividing a Foot into many thousand Parts for Mathematical purposes is as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Finding in one of the last Philosophical Transactions, how much M. <hi>Auzont</hi> esteems his invention of dividing a Foot into near 30000 parts, and taking thereby Angles to very great exactness; I am told, I shall be looked upon as a great wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our Nation, shou'd I not let the World know, that out of some scatter'd Papers and Letters, that formerly came to my hands, of a Gentleman of these parts, one Mr. <hi>Gascoigne,</hi> found out, that before the late Civil Wars, he had not only devised an instrument of as great a Power as M. <hi>Auzonts,</hi> but had also for some Years made use of it, not only for taking the Diameters of the Planets, and distances upon Land; But had farther endeavour'd out of its Preciseness, to gather many cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties in the Heavens, amongst which I shall only mention one, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the finding the Moon's distance, from two Observations, of her Horizontal, and Meridional Diameters, which I rather mention because the <hi>French</hi> Astronomer, esteems himself the first that took any such notice, as thereby to settle the Moon's Parallax. For our Country-Man fully consider'd it before, and imparted it to an acquaintance of his, who thereupon proposed to him the difficulties that would arise upon the Calculation; with considerations upon the strange Niceties necessary to give him a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61347:134"/>
certainty of what he desired; The very instrument he made I have now by me, and others more perfected by him, which doubtless he wou'd have Infinitely mended, had he not been slain unfortunately in his late Majesty's Service. He had a Treatise of Opticks ready for the Press, but though I have used my utmost endeavour to retrieve it, yet I have in that point been totally unsuccessful: But some loose Papers and Letters, I have particularly about this instrument for taking of Angles, which was far from perfect; Nevertheless I find it so far to exceed all others, that I have used my endeavours to make it exact, and easily tractable; which above a Years since I effected to my own desire, by the help of an Ingenious and and exact Watch-Maker in these parts, since which time I have not altogether neglected it, but employed it particularly in taking the distances (as occasion served) of the Circum-Jovia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, towards a perfect setling their motion. I shall only say of it, that it is small, not exceeding in weight, nor much in bigness an ordinary Pocket-Watch, exactly marking above 40000 Divisions, in a Foot by the help of two <hi>Indexes,</hi> the one shewing Hundreds of Divisions, the other Divisions of the Hundred; Every last Division in my small one containing 1/10 of an Inch, and that so precisely as I use it, there goes above 91/22 Divisions to a second. Yet I have taken Land Angles several times to one Division, though (for the reason mentioned by M. <hi>Auzont)</hi> it be very hard to come to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness in the Heavens, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the swift motions of the Planets; Yet to remedy that fault, I have devised a rest, in which I find no small advantage, and not a little pleasing those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who have seen it; being so easy to be made, and by the observer managed without the help of another; which second convenience my yet nameless instrument hath in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and is by reason of its smallness and shape, easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to any Telescope. Sir, if you think this invention thus improved, worthy to be take notice of by the Curious, you may command a more perfect description of it, or any of the observations, either Mr. <hi>Gascoigne</hi> or my Self have made with it.</q>

                  <head>A Description of the Instrument referring to the CVT.</head>
                  <p>THE 1, 2, &amp; 3. Figures do represent the several Parts of this Instruments; the 4th Figure part of the Telescope with the Instrument apply'd to it, and the 5th, the rest on which the whole reposeth.</p>
                  <p>The first Figure represents the Box with the whole Instrument, (excepting only the movable Cover) and the Screws, by which it is fixed to the Telescope. In this Figure <hi>(aaaa)</hi> is a small ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long brass Box, serving both to contain the Screws, and also to make all the several moveable parts of the Instrument to move very true, smooth, and in a simple direct motion; To one end here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is Screwed on a round Plate of brass <hi>(bbbb)</hi> about 3 inches o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; the extreme Limb of whose outside is divided into 100 e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual parts, and number'd by 10, 20, 30, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Through the middle of this Plate, and the middle of the Box <hi>(aaa)</hi> is placed a very Curiously wrought Screw about the bigness of a Goose Quill, and of the length of the Box, the Head of which is by a fixed Ring, or Shoulder on the inside; and a small springing Plate, <hi>(dd)</hi> on the outside, so adapted to the Plate, that it is not in the least subject to shake; The other end of this Screw is by another little Screw (whose small point fills the Center or hole made in the end of the longer Screw for this purpose) ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd so fixt or steady in the Box, that there appears not the least danger of shaking, upon the Head of this Screw without the springing Plate is put on a small Index <hi>(ee)</hi> and above that an handle <hi>(mm)</hi> to turn the Screw round as often as there shall be occasion, without at all endangering the displacing of the Index; it being put on very stiff upon a Cylindrical part of the Head, and the handle upon a square; the Screw hath that third of it, which is next the Plate, bigger than the other two thirds of it, by at least as much as the depth of the small Screw made on it, the thread of the Screw of the bigger third; is as small again as that of the Screw of the other two thirds; to the grosser Screw is adapted a Socket, <hi>(f)</hi> fastned to a long Bar or Bolt <hi>(gg),</hi> upon which is fastned the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61347:135"/>
moveable sight <hi>(h)</hi> either a Thread nearer or a Thread farther of from the fixt sight <hi>(i),</hi> the <hi>(kk)</hi> which will not admit of any shaking; There are Sixty of these Threads, and answerable thereto are made Sixty divisions, on the edge of the Bolt or Ruler <hi>(gg)</hi> and a small Index <hi>(l)</hi> fix'd to the Box <hi>(aaa)</hi> denotes how many Threads the edges of the two sights <hi>(h)</hi> and <hi>(i)</hi> are distant; and the Index <hi>(ee)</hi> shews on the circular plate, what part of a Revolution there is more, every Revolution as was said before being divided into an hundred parts, at the same time that the movable sight <hi>(h)</hi> is moved forwards or backwards, or more Threads of the courser Screw, is the plate <hi>(pp</hi> in Fig. 2) so as the middle betwixt the sights may lie in the Axis of the Glass, however the Screw be turned, the midst betwixt the sights will always be in the Axis, and the sights will equally, either open from it, or shut towards it.</p>
                  <p>Figure 2. Represents the moveable cover containing the Screws, to be by the Bookseller cut off by the pricked line <hi>(xxx)</hi> from the Paper, and to be fitly placed on Figure <hi>(1)</hi> according to the pricked line <hi>(yyy)</hi> answering thereto, that by the taking off as it were, or folding up of this cover, the inward Contrivance of the Screws, and sights may appear.</p>
                  <p>And because it is conceived by some Ingenious Men, that it will be more convenient instead of the edges of the two sights <hi>(h &amp; i)</hi> to employ two sights, fitted with hairs, therefore is add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Figure <hi>(3)</hi> Representing the two sights, <hi>(r &amp; s)</hi> so fitted with Threads <hi>(t &amp; u)</hi> that they may be conveniently used in the place of the solid edges of the sights <hi>(h &amp; i)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth Figure represents, how the Screws are to be put on, The Table <hi>(A. D.)</hi> is divided into three lengths, of which (as in ordinary ones) <hi>(B. C.)</hi> is to lengthen or Contract, as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject requires; But <hi>A. B.</hi> is here added, that at <hi>A.</hi> you may put such Eye Glasses, as shall be thought most convenient, and to set them still at the distance most proper for them, Indexes, or Pointers, which here are supposed to be at, <hi>B.</hi> which length also alters also in respect of divers Persons Eyes, <hi>(E.)</hi> is a Screw, by which the great Table can be fix'd so, as by the help of the

Figures any smaller part of it can immediately be found, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring only or knowing the Divisions on <hi>(B.

As for a description of the uses of this inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously contrived, and very curious Engine, the Reader may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it by the preceding Letter.</p>
                  <p>To this may be annexed another Letter of the same ingenious Gentleman, containing Observations on the quantity of Rain falling Monthly for several Years successively, which is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>

                        <p>I Have now completed this last Years Observations, which I was very desirous shou'd accompany the others I now send you, and I hope you will be pleased upon that score to pardon my delay in obeying your Commands, I wish they had been more exactly made, and shou'd have been so, had they been intended for any thing but my own satisfaction, and enabling me to give some Conjecture at the Proportion of Rain that falls in this Country, with that at <hi>London,</hi> and in other parts of this Kingdom, but in this I have not yet attained my desired end, not having heard of the like made in any part of <hi>England,</hi> tho' a Friend or two had promised to undertake, and afford me an Account of their Observations, but it may be they did not think it worth their while, or that it wou'd prove more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome than I found it; For I only fixed a round Tunnel of 12 inches Diameter to a leaden Pipe, which could admit of no Water but what came through the Tunnel, by reason of a part soder'd to the Tunnel it self which went over the Pipe, and served also to fix it to it, as well as to keep out any wet, that in stormy Weather might beat against the under part of the Tunnel, which was so placed that there was no building near it, that wou'd give occasion to suspect, that it did not receive its due Proportion of Rain, that fell through the Pipe some
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61347:136"/>
nine Yards perpendicularly, and then was bent into a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow near my Chamber, under which convenient Vessels were placed to receive what fell into the Tunnel, which I measured by a Cylindrical Glass, at a certain mark, containing just a pound, or twelve Ounces <hi>Troy,</hi> and had marks for small parts also; I preferr'd this way of finding the Contents of my Vessel, for measuring the Water, before any other, of gaging of small Cubical or Cylindrical ones, where an inconsiderable and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most indiscernible Error, in the dimensions, will prove much greater in the content, whereas in the other way, provided the Cylinder it self be small, or like a very small Neck at the mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place for a pound, one may easily come to as great exactness as may be wished, by the help of this Cylindrical Glass, I thus kept my account of what Rain fell, and generally twice or thrice a Day, when I took several other Observations, both of the Thermometer, Barometer, Winds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what Rain I found in the Receivers, if not more than made what was left in the Cylindrical Glass, a full pound I again left in it, but if there was more than that quantity, I filled it just to the pound mark, which I threw away, and did the like with the remaining Water, as often as it wou'd allow, still keeping an account of the pounds thrown away, and noting also the parts of a pound remaining in the Glass, by the help of which latter, and the parts remaining at any time before, by numbering the Pounds, and Substracting the Parts at the end, for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of one Month, from the Pounds thrown away, and the Parts remaining, at the end of another; I find the quantity of Rain fallen betwixt these two times, and that so as to assure me, that I erred no more in the quantity of Rain of another Year, than by mistake in the differences of the parts of a Pound, in the first, and last Observation, whereas shou'd I still Write down the Rain that falls between two Observations, I might be subject to make as great a mistake, in every one of them, and consequently be much more uncertain of the quantity of Rain fallen, in many of those added together; Besides, this Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is longer in performing, and giving the quantity sought,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61347:136"/>
than the method I make use of, I have added these particulars to show you how little trouble there is in this task; which therefore I hope some of your ingenious Friends may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded to undertake, and then by continuing my own Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I may be farther satisfy'd than hitherto I have been with them, for I have yet Learn'd as to the main point, is, that here we have almost just twice the quantity of Rain that falls at <hi>Paris.</hi> This County, and particularly that part of it where I live, being generally esteemed to have much more Rain than other Parts, and in a greater Proportion than I thought reasonable to be allow'd, however it be yet by what I have sent you, 'twould be unjust without farther Observations of the like Nature in other Parts, that all <hi>England</hi> shou'd be esteemed to abound as much in Rain as these parts do, where by reason of the very high Grounds in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> and the Eastern Parts of <hi>Lancashire,</hi> the Clouds driven hither by the South and S. W. the general Winds in this part of the World, are oftener stopt and broken, and fall upon us, than such as come by an E. and S. E. Winds, which broken by the Hills are generally spent there, and little affect us; and this is the reason that <hi>Lancashire</hi> has often considerably more Rain than <hi>Yorkshire.</hi>

                        <p>The above mention'd method of estimating Rain by pounds, to those of my Family, gave a sufficient Idea of the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the falling Rains, and the Wetness of the different Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, though they knew not how high it wou'd raise the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a Cylinder Equal, at the bottom to my Tunnel; but to inform others of this with little trouble, in the Table I have sent you the Pounds and Parts are doubled, and these I have rather sent you than those of the whole Pounds, since the same gives both the quantity of half Pounds, and the height in inches, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the general way of estimating the quantity of Rain, only with this difference, that for the half Pounds only the last Figure, is a decimal Fraction, and the other the number of the half Pounds, and for the height, the two last Figures denote the Decimal Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of an inch, and the remainder of the height in inches, so near the truth, that they only fall short of it one inch in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61347:137"/>
200. which defect is easily supply'd; To this I need only add that the numbers on the right hand, are the summs of all those in the same line, that is, in the first part of several num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for Ten Years, so that the last of them shews the summ both of the half Ounces, that have fallen during that space of time, and the height the Water wou'd have been raised in that time also; To this I shall only add one Example; The summ of all the Rain in the Ten first Years 41227. and therefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what has been said 4122(7. is the number of half Pounds, that fell in Compass of the Tunnel during those Ten Years, and 412(27. the height it wou'd have raised the Water during that time: But if you desire to be more Critical, if you add 2(06 its 200th part, you will have 414(33 for the true height; and 41(413 for the mean height by those Ten Years observations; and 412(27 for the mean quantity of half Pounds; by the same method you will have the means for the other Five, <hi>viz.</hi> Of height 41(78, and 417(8 for the mean number of half Pounds, which means do strangely agree, and both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd do give for the mean by all the Fifteen Years 41(516 inches in height, which is about ¼ of an inch more than double to that raised by the Water at <hi>Paris,</hi> which as set down in the Memoirs for the Ingenious, for <hi>February</hi> last, is stated about 19 ½ <hi>French</hi> inches, which make 21 <hi>English,</hi> I have omitted the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the Years 87, and 88, which I found faulty by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the Person (who had the charge of noting what Rain fell during my absence several times then from home) did not pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually observe the usual method I had prescribed him. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got when I mentioned my way of Gauging by weight that it was grounded upon 22(7368 Cubical inches of Rain Water, being equal in weight to one pound or 12 Ounces <hi>Troy,</hi> so that dividing any superficies in inches of a Vessel for receiving the Rain Water, by the before mentioned number it will give you the Pounds and parts, that will raise the Water upon that superficies with up-right sides, just an inch, and thus I found that 4(974 Pounds wou'd fill a Cylinder equal at the Bottom to my Tunnel, and one inch high, which you see is very near five Pounds, which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61347:137"/>
you will also find will only raise the Cylinder by <hi>1/200th</hi> part; but now I have detained you so long, and I am afraid needlesly, so that I trust to your goodness for Pardon in, and what else you shall find amiss upon the score of my Eyes, which oblige me to trust more to others, than otherwise I shou'd.</p>

                                 <p>It was very Rainy Weather before the Eclipse came on, so that had I not lost all hopes of a clear Sky, my Account of its beginning had been as exact as that of its Exit, I cannot ascertain to you all my Observations, because the Clouds often interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned betwixt me and the Sun, and many a blast of Wind discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd my Tube, and so alter'd the measures I had taken. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accident also interposed, for even when I came to compute the Dimensions I had observed of the Phases in two places from two parts of the Micrometer, my Servant that was to note down my observations through mistake had pen'd them very faulty, however I corrected them the best I cou'd. Such as they are, I freely recommend them to you, the place of Exit of the Eclipse was so vertual that I cou'd not possibly determine to what part it inclined from it. However at about 29 Minutes after nine by the Clock, I found there appear'd points Parallel to the Horizon. The Diameter of the Sun betwixt Nine and Ten was 2334 parts as I conjecture Eclips'd; afterwards the Sun coming to the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, by a long Meridian line I found the Clock was two slow by one Minute, and 42 seconds, but by a large Equinoctial Dial upon which are drawn Minutes and seconds, I found the Clock during the whole Morning had only been two slow by 45 se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds, I shall again Examine the Meridian line the first oppertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that offers. However in the mean time, I think we ought rather to confide in the correction made by that, than to rely upon the Aequinoctial Dial. The Eclipse by Mr. <hi>Townley</hi> was taken in the Latitude of 53 and 44, the Longitude from the <hi>London</hi> Meridian is about 9 hours to the West.</p>

                  <p>After this worthy Gentleman, let us mention our much La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and Eminent Country-Man Mr. <hi>Ieremiah Horrax.</hi> Of whom take the Learned Dr. <hi>Iohn Wallis</hi>'s Character, and account of his Works; This <hi>Horrax</hi> says he is the same with him that is the Author of that excellent Tract, called <hi>Venus</hi> in <hi>Sole Visa,</hi> publish'd by the Famous <hi>Hevelius,</hi> together with his <hi>Mercurius</hi> in <hi>Sole Visus:</hi> Who if he had not been snatch'd away by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Death, in the flower of his Age, wou'd certainly by his industry, and exactness, which did accompany his great affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61347:139"/>
to Astronony, have very considerably advanced that Science. Now we have only left us these imperfect Papers, digested not without great care and labour, by that Learned Mathematician Dr. <hi>Iohn Wallis</hi> Professor of Mathematicks in the University of <hi>Oxford;</hi> whereto do occur,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Keplerian</hi> Astronomy, asserted, and promoted, which this Author undertook, after he had spent much time and great pains in acquainting himself with that of <hi>Lansbergius,</hi> which he at first embraced with so much eagerness and addition, that it was difficult to divorce him from it; Till at length by the Advertisements of <hi>William Crabtree,</hi> a Sagacious and Diligent Astronomer at that time, he found that neither the Hypotheses of <hi>Lansbergius,</hi> were consistent among themselves, nor his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble agreed with observations exactly made; nor the precepts of them were well demonstrated, nor cou'd be, whatever that Man boasted of his wonderful agreement of his Tables, with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations of former times; all which Errors being found at last by our Author himself, and withal the Writings of <hi>Kepler,</hi> and the <hi>Rudolphin</hi> Tables, by him search'd into, he saw cause to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to the <hi>Lansbergian,</hi> because grounded upon Hypotheses consonant to Nature, and well agreeing with the Heavens, though he found causes, by his accurate observations, to amend even these Tables, yet without a necessity of changing the Hypothesis, in which Work when he was well engaged, he was cut of by Death very Young, in the 23th Year of his Age; His first pieces then were his Disputations against the Astronomy of <hi>Lansbergius,</hi> in which he clearly demonstrates that the Hypothesis of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor do neither agree with the Heav'ns, nor among themselves, which argument he carry'd on so far, that having finish'd the four first Observations (as they are here to be found) he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun a few sheets of the fifth, which was about the Diagram of <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> from which some have pretended exactly to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the distance of the Sun. After which follow two disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more, the one of the Coelestial Bodies, and their motions, the other his Answer to the Cavils of <hi>Hortensius,</hi> against <hi>Tycho,</hi> so much of the first part of this Volume.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:61347:139"/>
The second contains a good number of extracts out of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Letters to his intimate Friend, and industrious Companion in the study of Astronomy, <hi>William Crabtree,</hi> in which occur ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Coelestial Observations, interlaced with many notable Discourses, concerning the method of his studies.</p>
                  <p>The third is a Catalogue of AstronomicalObservations as they were made by our Author, without allowance for the Excentrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Eye, which he afterwards Castigated by a Correction fairly written with his own hand.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is his new Theory of the Moon together with the Lunar numbers of Mr. <hi>Flamsted</hi> upon it.</p>
                  <p>To these let us add the curious Experiments and Observations of <hi>Thomas Brotherton</hi> of <hi>Hey,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Esq</abbr> in the County of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> concerning the growth of Trees, which are as follows; The first Experiment was made in the Year 1671, upon a Crab-Tree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four Inches in Diameter. It was hacked round with an Hatchet, so as to cut pretty deep into the wood, besides cutting of the Bark for about four inches wide; after which it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to encrease above the said hacking very considerably, and to shoot in length of Wood about one foot; the next year it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased considerably, and shot in length about nine inches, but the third Year it died to the very Root.</p>
                  <p>Much the like was observed in another, part of whose Bark was Eaten off by a Canker, that the lower part stood without encreasing, and by degrees the Wood Rotted and Mortify'd; but the upper part increased to the third Year when it died also.</p>
                  <p>Most of the following Experiments were tryed on the Abies or Scotch-Firr, and on the Black Poplar with White Bark, and on Hazel or Ash-Trees.</p>
                  <p>A Scotch-Firr of three Years growth, having a Ring of the Bark cut off of the breadth of three inches, near the bottom of of the stem or stalk, below the uppermost knot, or joint, was observed to grow and shoot out its Top about half a Yard; and the parts all about the Ring to increase very much in thickness, much more than it wou'd have done if the Section had not been
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61347:140"/>
made; But all that part of the stock between the said Ring, and the knot next below it increased not at all; but that part that was below the knot increased somewhat, yet not so much as if the said Ring of the Bark, had not been cut off; the second Year it also increased considerably, but not so much as the first Year, but the third Year it died; the Branch that was here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced had the Ring cut off from it, <hi>April 1st</hi> 1686. and the part above the Section increased, and grew till the 17 of <hi>October</hi> following, when it was cut off from the Tree; In this space of time the part below the Ring increased not at all, but stood at a stay, but the part above the Ring shot out a new joint, between a Foot and half a Yard, and increased in thickness for the whole length of it, and in all its parts twice as much as it wou'd have done, if it had not been cut, as was apparent by a like Branch on the opposite side of the knot, which was not cut or barked round in the same manner; The Bark also of the part above the Section, swell'd or grew downwards over the woody part (which was bare) above half an inch in breadth.</p>
                  <p>The usual time for making this Section, was either in <hi>March,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>April;</hi> Tryal was made upon some Young Trees, cutting a Helical swath of the Bark, about half an inch in breadth, by leaving a like Helical swath of Bark, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate betwixt the upper and under part; in this Tryal the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of growth succeeded not, but the remaining swath of the Bark swelled downwards, and by the end of the Year, covered the bared part of the Wood; The like event almost follow'd, upon making an invented Section round, of about half an inch in breadth, the upper Bark quickly swelling downward, and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again with the lower. It was also observable, that as the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Bark grew downwards, so it increased also in thickness, whereas the Bark below thickned not at all. Several of those Boughs which were about an inch Diameter, and had increased as above, the Summer before were observ'd to out-live the great Frost, and to receive no considerable Damage, whereas others o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise order'd, were Killed by it, as will appear by and by more particularly: In the first Figure is represented a Scoth-Firr
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61347:140"/>
of three Years growth (it shooting forth every Year, both from the Body and the Branches, a new joint and Circumambient Sprouts to a determinate length) barked with three Rings of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 1 ½ inch broad, each about the middle of the <hi>Internodia,</hi> or parts of the stock between the joints, at <hi>c. b. &amp; a.</hi> this in one Year increased and shot forth branchings, as in the second Figure that is the stock at <hi>a.</hi> which was about the bigness of a Quill, below the Ring to the next joint, continued of the same bigness, but above the Ring it increased, and grew to the bigness of ones Finger, and from the new joint, at <hi>e. e.</hi> shot out new Limbs and stock, about a quarter of a Yard, which was somewhat big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than if there had been no Ring made; next the branch <hi>f. f.</hi> increased likewise proportionably, by swelling in bigness, and from a new joint shooting out new Body and Limbs, as the top and Body, and the Body of the Tree below the joint <hi>h.</hi> to the Ring <hi>b.</hi> increased more than if the Ring had not been made, but the part of the stock below the Ring to the next joint, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased not at all; The like shooting forth and increasing, was observed in the second Limbs, joint and stock, below it, <hi>g. g. i.</hi> to <hi>c.</hi> between which and <hi>k.</hi> it increased not; the like also suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the lower Branches <hi>l. l.</hi> any joint <hi>k.</hi> and in the stock <hi>d.</hi> below the joint <hi>k.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Figure third represents a young Scoth-Firr of two Years Old, on one of the lowermost Branches <hi>c.</hi> was made a Ring Section, between the Body, and first knot of the Limb; The following Year, that part of the Limb above the Ring, increased twice or thrice as much as the Corresponding parts of the other Limbs, from the same knot, as <hi>a.</hi> which increased as if there had been no Section made at <hi>B.</hi> but the part below <hi>b.</hi> to the Body, increased not at all.</p>
                  <p>Figure fifth represents a young Hazet cut into the Body with a deep gash, and the Parts of the Body above and below, cleft upwards, and downwards, and the Splinters <hi>a.</hi> and <hi>b.</hi> by wedges kept off from touching each other, or the rest of the Body; these in the following Year were observed to be in the State, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in the sixth Figure, that is the Splinter <hi>a.</hi> above the gash, was grown very much, but the Splinter <hi>b.</hi> below, stood at a stay
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61347:141"/>
and grew not, but the rest of the Body at <hi>c.</hi> grew as if there had been no gash made.</p>
                  <p>Figure seventh represents a like gash made just above the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermost knot, and the part Splinter'd or Cleft, and Wedged off from each other, and from the Body as before, but there is left a Branch upon the lower Splinter, to see what will be the state there of the next Year, or in <hi>October</hi> next, when it is probable by the other Experiments the lower Splinter and Branch upon it, will be found to have grown and increased, as the Splinter, in the former Experiment did above the gash, though not in the same Proportion.</p>
                  <p>Figure eight represents four young Poplar-Trees. <hi>A. B. C. D.</hi> all of equal bigness, growth, situation, and soil, as near as cou'd be found; these were order'd as is represented in the 9th Figure, that is, <hi>A.</hi> had all its Branches and Top cut off, <hi>B.</hi> had all its Branches pruned off, but it was left with a small head at the Top, <hi>C.</hi> had its Branches cut about half way, and those of the upper half left growing; <hi>D.</hi> was left growing, without being at all pruned or lopped, the event was expected, the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess was found to be thus, <hi>A.</hi> in the following Year shot out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Twigs round about, but the Body encreased but little in height or bigness; <hi>B.</hi> shot out likewise many Twigs, where it had been pruned, and the top Branches and top also encreased considerably, and the Body also increased much more in height and bigness than did the former; <hi>A. C.</hi> increased much more in all its parts than <hi>B.</hi> But <hi>D.</hi> increased in Limbs, height, and bigness most of all, swelling in bigness and stretching in heighth, and spreading in its Boughs much more than <hi>C.</hi> and in about ten Years time, was more than four times as big as <hi>A.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same worthy Person also observed, that all the Poplars, that has been pruned died in the Great Frost, 1684. in so much that in 25 that were so order'd, he observed 19 to be killed by it, and remaining to be very weak and hardly able to recover, and increased very little in the following Years; These Poplars were about 30 Foot high, and had only a small head left at the Top, unlopped, of about 4 or 5 Foot, and were pruned the Spring
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61347:141"/>
before the Great Frost; He observed also that divers of those that had been pruned, two Summers before the Frost, were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by it; but not one of those that had been pruned at all were hurt by it; He took notice likewise both in <hi>Lancashire</hi> and <hi>Cheshire,</hi> that Trees of 60 Foot in height, that had been pruned, and had only a small top left, were also killed by the said Frost, whereas those of the same kind and heighth which stood near to them, and had not been pruned, continued to flourish, and suffer'd no harm thereby. Several of those Branches of about an inch Diameter, and Trees that had been barked round, as above theSpring before the Great Frost, out-lived the Violence of the same, and the preceding Winter.</p>
                  <p>Where these prunings had been tryed upon Trees Twenty Foot high, the difference of their increase was sensible the following Summer, but in 7 or 8 Years time the difference is Prodigious, the unpruned, Trees growing several times bigger than the others that were pruned, both in Body and Branches ev'n to Admiration; He hath often observed also that when the top Branches wou'd shoot out, and grow two Foot, or more, in length, the lower branches wou'd not shoot above four inches; and farther that in the Branches of the Scotch-Firr, the joints above the Rings bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round wou'd increase, and grew much bigger in three, than they wou'd in five Years, if the said Rings were not cut of.</p>
                  <p>The same reason upon discoursing some other particular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries about the spreading and increase of the Roots, assured that he had observed a very large Pinaster, about two Foot and half Diameter, and of an height proportionable, <hi>(viz.</hi> of about 20 Yards, the lowest Boughs of which were about 30 Foot above the ground) did spread and flourish on every side alike, though it had no Root at all towards three quarters of its Situation, but only toward one quarter, into which it spread its Roots very far, and large, divers of them reaching above 70, or 80, Foot from the Body of the Tree, the Reason of which spreading was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd by its being Planted just within the square Angle of the Corner of a deep thick and strong Stone Wall, which was a kind of Banking, or Warfing, against a River that ran by it; this Tree I say, though it had nourishment only from one Quarter
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61347:142"/>
of four to its Roots, yet did the same flourish, and spread equally on every side.</p>
                  <p>Upon consideration of these and divers other Observations and Experiments, Mr. <hi>Brotherton</hi> is of Opinion (1.) That the sap, most of it, if not all, ascends in the Vessels of the Lignous part of the Tree, and not in the Cortical part, nor between the Corti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Lignous Parts.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) That increase and growth of a Tree in thickness is by descent of the sap, and not by the ascent, and if there were no descent, a Tree wou'd increase but very little, if at all.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) That there is a continual Circulation of the sap all the Summer Season, and during such time as the sap is stirring, and not a descent at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> only, as some have held.</p>
                  <p>To me it seems very probable, that the Bodies of Plants, as well as those of moving Animals, are nourished and increased by a double Food, the one an impregnated Water, and the other an impregnated Air, and that without a convenient supply of these two, the Vegetable cannot subsist, at least not increase; these do mutually mix, and coalesce, and parts of the Air convert to Water, and parts of Water to Air, as some of these latter are rarify'd and freed from their Chains, and become Spiritual and Airy, so others of the forementioned, are clogged, and setter'd, and become debased. To this purpose all Plants, as well as Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, have a twofold kind of Roots, one that Branches, and spreads into the Earth, and another that spreads and shoots in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air, both kinds of Roots serve to receive and carry their proper nourishment to the Body of the Plant, and both serve al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to convey and carry off the useless Recrements; Useless I mean any farther, within the Body of the Plant, though useful to it when they are seperated, and without it, the one for season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earth and Water, wherein it is Planted, and the other for seasoning the Air, the method of which I have elsewhere explained.</p>
                  <p>To these, I hope without offence, may be subjoined two Letters, writ by my self some Years ago, to that Learned Society; for whatever is drawn from the Transactions relating to these parts,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61347:142"/>
though before published, may yet give a diverting information to many Gentlemen, who are strangers to those Papers, the first Letter directed to Dr. <hi>Plot</hi> Secretary to the Royal Society, runs thus.</p>
                  <p>Since you gave me some Specimens of the Water of <hi>Latron,</hi> and likewise of <hi>Nitrian Nitre,</hi> I have found that those descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Ancients gave of it, exactly agree with those Specimens we have here; Their Encomiums of it were so many, and so different the Names, which they ascribed to it, as a Sceptick indeed might equally Question whether or no they writ of any thing else, or whether or no they writ of any such thing, that we might therefore better understand the writings of the Ancients concerning it, and the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> which it afforded here, I have thought convenient to make use of this method: I shall in the first place shew whence <hi>Nitre</hi> had its Denomination; in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the different Names which Ancient Authors ascribe to it; in the third, the different places whence it comes; In the fourth, a description of it as it is when a <hi>Compositum;</hi> In the fifth, the number of its principles when Chymically resolv'd; in the sixth, the rise of them; in the seventh, its Seperation from the Water of <hi>Latron;</hi> in the eighth, its use in Physick; in the ninth, in Agriculture and Mechanicks; in the tenth, wherein it differs from <hi>Sal Armoniac;</hi> in the eleventh from Salt Petre.</p>
                  <p>That all <hi>Nitre</hi> took its Name from a Town in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> called <hi>Nitria,</hi> I shall take for granted; I shall therefore in the next place give an account of the different Names which by Authors are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to <hi>Nitre.</hi>

                  <p>By <hi>Hypocrates</hi> it is sometimes called <hi>Sal Aegypti, Sal in Aquis crescens, &amp; Nitrum Rubrum,</hi> By <hi>Basil, Serpens Terrenus,</hi> By <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius, Flavilla Salis,</hi> By <hi>Pliny, Spuma Nitri, &amp; Ros pinguioris Naturae;</hi> By the <hi>Graecians, Halmiraga;</hi> By <hi>Encelius,</hi> it is called <hi>Cryfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colla, Baurac, Sal Lucidum; Sal Petrosum, Sal Anderenae;</hi> but the word <hi>Baurac</hi> by the <hi>Babilonians</hi> is less restrained, for they divide <hi>Nitre</hi> into two Species, the one they term <hi>Sal Petrosum Purpureum, Modice Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> the other Species they term <hi>Baurac,</hi> which they used in Season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Meat; the former of these may probably be the <hi>Nitre</hi> here spoke of, and the latter Salt Petre. By <hi>Iungius</hi> and <hi>Hofman,</hi> it is called

                     <hi>Cerberus Chymicus,</hi> and <hi>Sal Infernalis;</hi> By <hi>Rulandus</hi> and <hi>Iohnson,</hi> it is called <hi>Faex Vitri,</hi> and <hi>Cinis Clavellatus,</hi> and so by <hi>Fallopius,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Cabalatar, Algali, Anatron, Tincar, Sago;</hi> Here likewise is to be noted that <hi>Aphronitrum,</hi> called by <hi>Schwenckfeldius</hi> in his Tracts <hi>de Fossibus Silesiae, flos Asiae,</hi> and <hi>Spuma Nitri,</hi> is not, as I conceive, specifically distinct from the <hi>Natron</hi> here spoke of. For according to <hi>Molenbrochius,</hi> and <hi>Iunken,</hi> that will Ferment with an Acid, and is commended in the same Distempers, as the <hi>Nitre</hi> of <hi>Nitria;</hi> again it is said by <hi>Pliny, fontibus quibusdam innatat, Vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur<expan>

                  <p>By <hi>Encelius</hi> it is said to be found in <hi>Armenia, Rabbath, Africa, Rome, Aegypt,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> and therefore by him is divided into six Species, <hi>Nitrum, vel est Armen. Afric. Aegypt. Rabbath; Rom. Vel. Babyl.</hi> By <hi>Wormius</hi> it is said to be found in <hi>Nova Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spania;</hi> The <hi>Natron</hi> may be described thus, it is an Alkaly Salt perforated like a Sponge, and of a Lixivial taste, and thus I find it described by <hi>Pliny, Mathiolus,</hi> and <hi>Agricola.</hi> Its Principles I take to be chiefly two, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Sal Marine,</hi> and an Urinous Salt.</p>
                  <p>That it contains a <hi>sal Marine</hi> seems manifest, by these Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, first, because that a Solution of the <hi>Natron</hi> has much of the tast that a Solution of <hi>Sal Marine</hi> hath, secondly, in Evaporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Particles of the <hi>Natron</hi> incrustated upon the surface of the Water, as the Particles of Sea-Salt do in Evaporation. Thirdly, because the <hi>Natron</hi> is perforated, which proceeds as I suppose from a <hi>Sal Marine,</hi> for that when it Chrystallizeth shooteth into little Cavities; Fourthly, if the <hi>Natron</hi> be mixed with Salt of Tartar, it emits the same Spirit as <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> when mixt with the same Salt. And Lastly, That it contains a Sea Salt seems plain from <hi>Cesalpinus.</hi> Says he, <hi>Efflorescit etiam sponte non solum in salinis ad similitudinem lanuginis canescentis, sed etiam in Vasis in quibus sal continetur;</hi> But here it is to be noted, that though the <hi>Nitrian</hi> Water is of a blushy Colour, and makes a brisk fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with an Acid, yet a solution of <hi>Natron</hi> looks clear, and will not ferment with an Acid; the reason why a solution of the <hi>Natron</hi> looks clear, though the <hi>Nitrian</hi> Water, which is but a solution of the same Salt, is of a blushy Colour, may perhaps be this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:61347:143"/>
I suppose that the Water of <hi>Latron</hi> receives its redness from a red clammy substance, which serves chiefly to cement the two Salts together, and this I the rather conjecture, because after a solution of the <hi>Natron</hi> had pass'd through a Filtre, there stuck to it a red clammy Matter and the solution was clear, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why a solution of the <hi>Natron</hi> will not ferment with an Acid I conceive to be this, because in a perfect dissolution its parts being seperated one from another by the parts of the Water, their strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are too weak to make an Effervescency with an Acid, and in this I was farther confirmed by these two Experiments.</p>
                  <p>I found that if into a solution of the <hi>Natron,</hi> I pour'd an Acid while the Water looked Whitish or Disturbed, the Salt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly dissolved, it made a brisk Fermentation, but when the Water came to be clear, the Salt being then perfectly dissolved, if I then poured an Acid upon it, it wou'd not ferment; I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise found that this solution being Evaporated to a third part, wou'd ferment again.</p>
                  <p>Its second Principle I take to be an Urinous Salt, First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if mixed with Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> it smells like <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> when mixed with the same Salt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when it was distilled with Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> in a retort, it afforded an Urinous Spirit as piercing as Spirit of <hi>Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come now to the rise of its Principles <hi>Sal Marine,</hi> and a volatile Alkaly, <hi>Sal Marine</hi> being a Fossile Salt, I shall take for granted it receives from the Earth, and shall endeavour to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate it hath its volatile Alkaly from the Air; First, because it is said by <hi>Pliny spumam Nitri</hi> (which is the <hi>Natron</hi> here spoke of) <hi>Antiqui negebant fieri nisi ros cecidisset.</hi> By Monsieur <hi>de le Chambre</hi> it is affirmed, that three or four days before the Nile begins to overflow, there falls a certain dew which hath a fermenting vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and leav'ns a Past exposed to the Air, and at that time saith <hi>Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Le Chambre,</hi> the <hi>Nitre</hi> Pits grow full of <hi>Nitre,</hi> and sands. <hi>Vanssebius,</hi> and several say, that though 500 in a day die at <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> of the Plague, before the beginning of the Inundation of the Nile, yet the very day after there does not one
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61347:144"/>
die, which doubtless cou'd not proceed from any other reason, than because at that time the Air was impregnated with this vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Alkaly, for at that time the <hi>Nitre</hi> Pits grow full, and this dew falls; This I think may sufficiently hint to us the great use of its volatile Spirit; Especially in Pestilential Distempers.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, about that time the Nile begins to o'erflow those Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimens which we had here, grew heavier by being exposed to the Air; Here it is to be noted that this Alkaly is not made so by Fire, I cannot therefore conclude with <hi>Helmont,</hi> that all Alkalies are made so by that Element. The next thing to be consider'd is its seperation from the Water in <hi>Latron,</hi> of which the Learned Dr. <hi>Huntington,</hi> who was at <hi>Nitria,</hi> gives us this account; There is a Town in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> called <hi>Nitria,</hi> which gives name to the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trian</hi> desert, where there is a Lake called <hi>Latron,</hi> taking up an Area of six or seven Acres, situate about thirty Miles West and by South from <hi>Terena</hi> a Town lower upon the Nile than <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> and about the same distance Northwest from the <hi>Pyramids.</hi> From the bottom of this Lake ariseth this sort of <hi>Nitre,</hi> call'd <hi>Natron,</hi> to the top (as they do apprehend) and there by the Heat of the Sun condenseth into this kind of substance, that all the <hi>Nitre</hi> comes from the bottom to the Top I dare not affirm, I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore premise some <hi>Phoenomena</hi> it afforded in Evaporation, before I give you my conjecture about it; I took an Evaporating Glass which held about four Ounces, and pour'd into it two Ounces of <hi>Nitrian</hi> Water, this I set upon a sand Furnace, giving it Fire by degrees, as soon as the Water was warm, the particles of <hi>Nitre</hi> began to swim upon its surface, in stragling and uneven numbers, these after a while United, and afterwards there arose a Salt suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to Colour the whole superficies of the Water, I took then a thin Glass and skinn'd off this Ice, but cou'd scarce take it all of before it was seconded by another, and thus the Salt did rise successively in Films, as long as there was any Water in the Glass, these Films had the Colour and taste of the <hi>Nitre</hi> that came from <hi>Nitria,</hi> and did like it ferment with an Acid; And these are they which by <hi>Pliny</hi> are called <hi>Flos Salis,</hi> and if I mistake not, the same with that which <hi>Herodotus</hi> saith, they make their Mummy with,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61347:144"/>
if therefore by the Languishing heat of a Digesting Furnace, the the <hi>Nitrous</hi> Particles cou'd seperate themselves from the Water, and over that spread themselves in an Ice, it may be as probable that by the greater heat of the Sun, the <hi>Nitre</hi> of <hi>Latron</hi> is sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Water after the same manner, and as in the Evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of other mineral Waters, when the Water is not strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to hold up the Salt, it is generally cover'd with a thin Film; so I suppose in the Evaporation of <hi>Natron</hi> some Particles of the Water being flown away, the Particles of the <hi>Sal Marine</hi> branch one into another, and so incrustate upon the surface of the Water.</p>
                  <p>In this Hypothesis I was the farther confirm'd by this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I took some of the <hi>Natron</hi> and dissolved it in Water, and set it to Evaporate, and I found that the Salt did not incrustate upon the Water, till three parts of the Water was Evaporated, it did not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seem probable that all the <hi>Nitre</hi> came from the bottom to the top, and so condensed by the heat of the Sun, but that they incru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stated when the saline Particles branched one into another, some of the Aqueous parts being exhaled.</p>
                  <p>The reason why its volatile Alkaly in Evaporation does not fly quite away, is because it is held there by the <hi>Sal Marine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing to be consider'd is its use in Physick; by <hi>Pliny</hi> it is commended in Ulcers, and Inflammations, Palsey in the Tongue, Consumptions, Cholick Haemorhagies, Purulent Ears, and Intermitting Fevers; By <hi>Galen</hi> it is said, <hi>desiccat, &amp; digerit, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to autem majus ejus spuma;</hi> By <hi>Agricola</hi> its prescribed in the same cases, commended as a Cephalick, of wonderful success in the Griping of the Guts, intermitting Fevers, and the Leprosy, <hi>Mathiolus</hi> commends it in the same cases; By <hi>Hypocrates</hi> it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended when the <hi>Menstrua</hi> are obstructed, and again saith he, <hi>purgat humores albos, convenit in abortionibus ubi puer haud exierit,</hi> he likewise commends it in some kinds of barrenness, and to this <hi>Kircher</hi> in his <hi>Mundus subteraneus</hi> alludes, when he says, <hi>Nili aqua in potum redit non modo saluberrimum, sed &amp; faecundandis mulieribus mite opportanum;</hi> and <hi>Petrus Giurius,</hi> gives us this memorable story out of <hi>Caesius,</hi> that when <hi>Philadelphus</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Daughter <hi>Berenice,</hi> to <hi>Antiochus</hi> King of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:61347:145"/>
he Commanded his Daughter to Drink of the Water of <hi>Nile,</hi> that she might make her Husband happy in a numerous Off-Spring; By the Testimony therefore of <hi>Hypocrates, Galen, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiolus, Diascorides, Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Agricola,</hi> it appears to have been of great use in Physick. But here it is to be noted, that when <hi>Nitre</hi> is prescribed by the foremention'd Authors, that <hi>Nitre</hi> which is an ingredient in Gun-Powder is not to be understood; Amongst the Moderns we have this account of it, Monsieur <hi>du Closs</hi> is of Opinion, that most of the Mineral-Waters in <hi>France,</hi> are impregnated with this sort of <hi>Nitre,</hi> and that all their Cures are done by it. <hi>Molenbrochius,</hi> affirms a Tincture of <hi>Aphronitum</hi> to be of wonderful Efficacy in the Stone, this I the rather Credit, because it is said by <hi>Iunken,</hi> in his <hi>Medicus,</hi> the <hi>Nitre</hi> of <hi>Nitria</hi> is of so piercing a Spirit, that it will not permit either Stone or Rock to be thereabout; And <hi>Ten Rine</hi> in his Meditations <hi>de Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri Medicina,</hi> affirms it to be of wonderful success in the same Distempers.</p>
                  <p>The next thing to be consider'd is its use in Agriculture, and in Treating of this, I think, it convenient to premise one <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon</hi> which it afforded in Evaporation: when the Salts had spread themselves over the Water in an Ice, those thin Plates af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while wou'd break, and ascend in perpendicular lines to the top of the Glass, I do say therefore, that <hi>Nitre</hi> may be said to fertilize the ground after this manner; Its volatile Particles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by some subterraneous Fire, or else by the heat of the Sun, they do quickly ascend into the small Tubes of the Plant, and by their Elastick Nature carry along with them, or force before them, those Particles which as they differently convene, consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the different parts of the Plant.</p>
                  <p>But this conjecture will be made something the more probable, by an Experiment in <hi>Kircher,</hi> where he says, if you take a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Tube, and put into it <hi>Tartar,</hi> Quick-Lime, Salt, and the Urine of a Wine Drinker, reduced into a Mass, which is to be hardned in the Sun, and after that set in a cold Cellar, by the help of Salt-Petre from the beforemention'd Mass, you will not without admiration see Flowers branch out of it; yea, such is the force
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61347:145"/>
of <hi>Nitre,</hi> that if in a Glass kept close shut, you put the juices of some Nitrous Herbs, on the before-mention'd Mass, <hi>Nitre</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd within it being pregnant with Spirits, will force it self through the very Pores of the Glass.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>de La Chambre</hi> says, Plants do grow in <hi>Aegypt</hi> in such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that they wou'd Choak one another, if not hindred by throwing Sand upon the Fields, insomuch, that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> must take as much pains in lessening the fatness of their Land, as other Nations do to increase the fatness of it.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Mechanicks</hi> we have this account of it, its said by <hi>Pliny,</hi> Cap. <hi>de Vitri inventione,</hi> that a Company of Merchants being thrown upon a shore, where there were not any Stones to be found, were forced to take great pieces of <hi>Aegyptian Nitre</hi> out of their Ships, and make Walls, upon which they hung their Boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kettle, the <hi>Nitre</hi> being heated by the Fire mix'd with the Sand, ran into several Streams of Glass, which afterwards hinted the way of making Glass, it is likewise of use in Dying; for <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Vitrivius</hi> affirm, that by the help of this, true Azure is made, and that without this, there cannot be a true shadow.</p>
                  <p>In the last place, I come to consider wherein it differs from Salt Petre, and <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> it may be distinguished from Salt Petre; First by its fermenting; it will ferment with any acid, but Salt Petre will not, I found it wou'd ferment with Vinegar, as the old Commentators observe in their Comments upon <hi>Ieremiah</hi> and the <hi>Proverbs;</hi> but Salt Petre will not, which gave occasion to some in those Texts to alter the Word <hi>Nitre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It may be distinguish'd from Salt Petre in its taste, for Natron hath a Lixivial taste, the other not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By the volatile Spirit it affords: For from one comes over a volatile Alkaly, but from the other a Corrosive Acid.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Natron affordeth a red clammy substance, insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, but the other not, this Clammy substance, if I mistake not, is that which by <hi>Pliny</hi> is called <hi>Aerugo Salis,</hi> this it hath from the Earth, and therefore it is again said by <hi>Pliny, sunt ibi Nitraria in quibus, &amp; rufum exit à colore Terrae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Like Salt Petre it will not Chrystallize.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:61347:146"/>
Sixthly, in the fire it makes no Detonation, but in this it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles Salt Petre, as that by the Flowers of Sulphur is made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Sal Prunellae,</hi> so this if you drop Spirit of Sulphur upon it, shoots into Pyramidal Salt, that is not by the tast distinguishable from <hi>Sal Prunellae,</hi> though its tast before was Lixivial; From <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> it may be distinguished first by its Colour, for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron is redish, the other not; secondly, by the Texture in <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> the parts seem close, and firmly knit together, but the Natron is Spungy and Perforated, thirdly, if mixt with <hi>Sal Armoniac, Sal Armoniac</hi> Emits the same Spirit, as it does when mixt with Quicklime.</p>
                  <p>But I think it comes more near to the Nature of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> than Salt Petre, first, because it is composed of a Sea-Salt, and an Urinous Alkaly, secondly, like <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> when dissolved in Water, it makes it extreamly cold, and as <hi>Franciscus Hernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez</hi> says, in his History of <hi>Mexico,</hi> it produces the same effect when dissolved in Wine; but I have not at present the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of trying this, the Specimens now being but small.</p>
                  <p>I cannot therefore conclude with <hi>Kircher,</hi> that the Natron is not Specifically distinct from Salt Petre, or with <hi>Libavius,</hi> that it is a Composition of Alum, Sea Salt, and White-Wine; These all are the Observations I have been able to make at present concerning this Mineral; if any more occur, you shall have an account of them. Note here I was the first that ever prepared a volatile Alkaly from that Salt.</p>
                  <p>The Second Letter concerning Digestion take as follows.</p>
                  <p>Shou'd I reckon up here the many Controverted Hypotheses of Anatomists concerning this subject, and set up a new one of my own; it might perhaps seem a piece of fond presumption: I shall not therefore be so vainly Opinionative, as to think I have fully explained here the Nature of Digestion, but shall only give you an account of an Artificial Digester, which I hope may something illustrate the Natural one, It has been observed by <hi>Helmont Maebius, Tachenius,</hi> and the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> that Meats by being kept in an acid Liquor, wou'd look extreamly White; But I do not find, that by the help of a Salt, that is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61347:146"/>
meerly an Acid, there can be any Chyle prepared from any Meats; <hi>Wedelius</hi> is of Opinion, that Chyle is nothing but a mixture of Oil, and Serum; <hi>Tilingius</hi> affirms it is made by a Nitrous Salt, Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> by Tritruration; Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> by an Acid and Sulphur; <hi>Sylvius</hi> and <hi>Diemerbrook</hi> by the <hi>Salva,</hi> Dr. <hi>Mayow</hi> by a Nitroaeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al principle; <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> by Heat; others by a Ferment spewed from the Glands at the bottom of the Stomach; others by the relicks of the meat grown sour. So many different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, I shall neither endeavour to reconcile nor decide; I shall therefore only lay down the <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> this Liquor afforded, and from thence draw inferences as probable conjectures; But shall in the first place premise a description of this digesting Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and see how far it may probably Parallel the natural fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Stomach. The taste of it is like Meat vomited out of a full Stomach, something sour, but will not ferment with an Alkaly.</p>
                  <p>It is prepared from Spirit of Sulphur, Spirit of Harts-Horn, the Chyle of a Dog, and is <hi>Saliva;</hi> it is pellucid and without any smell; the Salt that it shoots into is Cubical; upon Veal it afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> into a Dram of this Liquor, I put a piece of Veal the bigness of a Nut, and set it upon a digesting Fornace, in two hours time there came from the Meat a Liquor, that had the Tast and Colour of Chyle, and the Meat was afterward Lighter, Dry, and Insipid, and it afforded the same <hi>Phoenomena</hi> likewise in Beef, Mutton, or any other Meat I cou'd meet with: And here it is to be noted, tho' it has been affirmed by some, that the same thing may be done by acid Liquors only, yet since by all the Tryals I have made upon them, I have not yet observed them, I hope my Scepticism in this Case may be pardonable; If therefore we now consider, by the help of this <hi>Menstruum,</hi> there came from the before-mention'd Meats, a Liquor which had the Colour, and Tast of Chyle, and if we farther consider, that the Tast of this <hi>Menstruum</hi> is not distinguishable, from the Tasts of Meats vomited out of a full Stomach, I hope I may, without being thought fond of an Hypothesis, conjecture, that by some such <hi>Menstruum,</hi> the Meat is Digested in the Stomach;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61347:147"/>
But here I wou'd not be thought to affirm that by a liquid <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum</hi> only, the Meats are digested in the Stomach, but that there are likewise required these farther requisites in some or in most Creatures; First, That the Stomach receives a gentle heat from the Liver, it is therefore for this reason, said by the Learned <hi>Glisson, Calor hepatis in hepate est actio, &amp; Ventriculo est Usui.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That the Stomach have a Natural Situation, for says <hi>Riolanus, interdum Ventriculus propendit us<expan>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of DISTEMPERS.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEfore I enter upon the Treatise of Distempers, I think, it may be suitable to my present business, to insert here some preternatural remarks on various <hi>Phoenomena</hi> found in Human, and Animal Bodies of different Species; I have now by me Red Stones, and others of a Chalky matter taken out of the Calf of a Man's Leg; from another voided by stool, a stony substance cover'd over with a Body resembling a Spunge, from others concreted, bile Stones perfectly Triangular, and smooth as polished Marble, taken out of the <hi>Vesica fellea</hi> of an Ox, from another a substance exactly like that of the Bark of a Tree; This was presented to me my worthy Friend <hi>Henry Bradshaw,</hi> of <hi>Marple,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> I have likewise by me a perfect Shell taken out of the Bladder of a Hog, hair Balls taken out of the Stomachs of Calves, Cows, and Oxen are familiar enough, as to spungy and stony substances, in the Bowels and Bodies of Men and Women, it is most probable they are produced by a mixture of Marine and Bilous Particles, converting the aliment, and the juices in those parts into those Bodies; But the Vegetation of Spunges not ing perfectly discover'd, pretend not in this matter to be positive, for none ever yet cou'd discover their Seeds, so that they seeming to be only Concretions of various Bodies, from Sea-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Hypothesis concerning these may challenge the more probability; as to Shells found in Animals: The illustration of these will the better appear by giving you an account of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Shells in general, which may be reduced into two Kinds, the Pearly, and the Chalky kind, the former are composed of several <hi>Laminae,</hi> and frequently contain Pearls, as Muscles, and Oysters, the Lobster, and Coc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> seems to be concreted Chalky substances, the Pearl it self is likewise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of various <hi>Laminae,</hi> and is the most volatile part of the <hi>Mater Perlarum,</hi> but of that I have sufficiently treated before
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61347:149"/>
to which I refer you, these kind of shells are composed of Oily Saline, and Viscid Particles, and are indurated by their Saline and the Nitrous Bodies they imbibe from the Air, not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like those Concretions Observable in the mixtures of Alkalies, and Acids. The Chalky Shells are nothing but a mixture of Alkalious Saline and Terrene parts, and in their first separation from the Fish are Viscid, and Pellucid, and receive their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Colours from various mixtures of the Particles of the Air; The truth of this Hypothesis is evident from their Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, Fermentations, Solutions, and gradual Vegetations; now the Shells of the Fishes being formed after this manner, it may not be difficult to account for Shells sometimes found in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Animals, since there is no Animal but what contains a sufficient Proportion of such Saline and Terrene Particles. As to Hair Balls they are usually found in that part of the Stomach of the above mentioned Beasts called the <hi>Reticulum,</hi> or manifold. They are generally of a Black, or Dusky shining Colour, not much unlike that of Bezoar Stone found in the Bowels of <hi>Indian</hi> Goats, under the superficies is a stony substance, but will not as Bezoar ferment with an Acid, nor indeed with an Alkaly. Wherefore to me it seems probable, it may be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the <hi>Succus</hi> of the Glands, Choler, and the <hi>Mucus</hi> of the Stomach, which may reasonably be supposed to indurate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that matter, the liquid parts being cast off by the innate heat of the Stomach, the more Terrene ones must consequently fix and incrustate, in those Cells which are not to be discover'd in other Creatures. The Hairs contain'd in these are usually short and broken, which by the rough superficies of the Tongues of these Creatures, either by sucking in, or licking them, they are convey'd into the Cells of the Ventricles, and there formed into a Globular Figure; for though some may urge that their Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles abounding with Glands, those Hairs might as well be formed there, as in other parts of the Body, as sometimes in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, yet that conjecture is groundless, because the Hairs there are fixed and terminated upon Glands; but these Balls are inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the Stomach, and seem not to have ever been inserted in any Glandules there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:61347:149"/>
And now before I proceed to Distempers in general, I shall beg leave to insert some few, peculiar rather to these, than the more Southward parts of the Kingdom; The first is the Felon only incident to Infants, and usually in their first Year; it breaks out upon the Body like an Itch, with an inflammation attending it; The Face, and Head, and sometimes the Arms, and other parts of the Body are over-spread with a White or Yellow Scurf, not unlike that in the recedence of the Small-Pox; It is certain this nauseous Distemper is very pernicious in these tender Blooms; But again, those Infants that have it not, are commonly unhealthful; The Origine of this Distemper must certainly come from the Saline Particles of the Air, and the same temper of the Milk, occasion'd doubtless from the plenty of Salt Meats, and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd Bread, the too common Food of these parts, the Blood thus saturated with these Particles, and they separated by the Miliary Glands of the <hi>Cutis,</hi> must necessarily stagnate, and consequently inflame, and corrupt, whence inevitably follows this Epidemical Scab, or <hi>Psora.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The method of Physick in this case is but small, since it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be taken off with a little <hi>Calomelanos,</hi> or <hi>Syr. Cichor cum Rhab,</hi> and Anointing the parts with <hi>Ol. Ros. Camphorat.</hi> Sometimes the Poor Infants take the Distemper from their Nurses, who have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Itch, and in those it is the more difficultly Cured, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cou'd heartily wish the Gentry, who often Nurse forth their Children, wou'd be very cautious in their choice of these Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>The Rickets, and Scrophulous cases, are likewise very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongst us, but chiefly occasion'd by the Milk of Nurses with Child, who for a small advantage prostitute their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, to an unpardonable Wickedness, and make no scruple by this means to ruin Hundreds, the Act is so opprobrious, and the Mischiefs so numerous, that for my part, I think, <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus,</hi> when nourished by the Milk of a Wolf, on the Banks of <hi>Tyber,</hi> received a more Palatable, and much more healthful Diet. <hi>Scrophulous</hi> cases may be ranked amongst the <hi>Opprobria Medicorum.</hi> They may be divided into these Classes, <hi>Strumous, Glandulous,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61347:150"/>
Cutaneous,</hi> and <hi>Osseous,</hi> the first may be termed Mesenterical, the Glands there being obstructed, and thence ensue the Rickets, or Consumption; the other species are attended very often with that Herculean Distemper, called a <hi>Spina Ventosa,</hi> I have seen the Scrophulous Glands of the Mesentery, impleted with a pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucid Liquor, not unlike the White of an Egg, and sometimes like Honey, which no doubt proceeds from no other cause than the <hi>Serum</hi> made too <hi>Viscid</hi> by its saline Particles, which then stagnates distends and swells up the insterstices of the Fibres, and thence proceed their bigness, and hardness, this humour being long entertain'd, and lodged there, at length acquires so high an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony, as by the perpetual Corrugations of the Fibres, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Cancerous, and very difficult, if not incurable, wherefore in this Case, before the Patient is too much Emaciated, or the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick too far advanced, after the common Method has not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, it is prudent, as well as necessary to attempt a Salivation, managed with great care, and discretion, as to the <hi>Cutaneous Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phules,</hi> occasion'd by a <hi>Viscid Lympha,</hi> distending the Miliary Glands; their Tumours are usually soft, white, and without pain, and common both in Young, and adult Persons, but are by a gentle Salivation easily removed; In the <hi>Spina Ventosa</hi> in the joints, or elsewhere, the Bone is Carious, and the Humour so Virulent, it swells the Bone like an Honey-Comb, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times throws it off in Exfoliations, or by digesting it in a puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent matter, this is seldom, or difficulty Cured, but often terminates in a Consumption; I have known some linger long in this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, actual Cauteries apply'd to the Bones, and Salivation car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd on very regularly, and that too for no short time, yet all these processes unsuccessful; I cou'd wish our Learned Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this case wou'd make their utmost Applications, for the discovery of some specifick to correct this Humour, I have often seen a bright Silver Probe, turn'd to a Livid Colour by merely passing it into the Orifice, wherefore to me it seems probable some potent Alkaly might be thought of to be of service here.</p>

And now having dispatched my remarks on the preceding par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, I shall enter on the Treatise of other Chronical Diseases, and since after all my Observations in Natural History, Man justly assumes the noblest part in the Creation, for whose good each individual in its proper Sphere does, or ought to Act in this World; he only then may Challenge our strictest enquiries: Here indeed is a Field large enough, and a subject too Copious for these Sheets, I shall therefore contract my self on the several Heads, and be as short as the subjects will admit, and shall first begin with that Distemper called the Scurvy, as being the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis of many others.</p>

                     <p>Of the SCURVY.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I Thought it necessary to give a full account of this Distemper, that I might thereby more fully illustrate those that are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant with it, in order to which, I shall in the first place, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with its various Denominations amongst the <hi>Greeks, Arabians, Latins, Germans, Dutch</hi> and <hi>Danes;</hi> in the second place shew in what Countries it is most Epidemical, and assign the reason of that; and thirdly, shall describe its various Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, with a rationale of them; and illustrate these by various Histories; and lastly, lay down a general Method of Cure for the Whole. The Word Scurvy most probably took its Name from <hi>Danish, Dutch,</hi> or <hi>Saxon,</hi> particularly in <hi>Lower-Saxony,</hi> viz. <hi>Schobrock, Scorbock, Schaerbunck, Scharmundt, Schorbeck,</hi> which in those Languages signifie, or denote a faetidness of the Breath, Gripes of the Bowels, and Universal pains, a Debility of the Limbs, and spots upon the Skin, which to this Distemper being inseparated Symptoms, it is evident the Word must be derived from thence. By <hi>Marcellus</hi> in the time of <hi>Gratian</hi> and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> Roman Emperours, it was stiled <hi>Oscedo, ab Oscitatione,</hi> from fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent yawning usually attending this Malady; <hi>Pliny</hi> assigns it a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61347:151"/>
different Denomination, <hi>viz. Scelotyrbe,</hi> which is very clear by the description he gives us of a Distemper contracted in a Camp on the Banks of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in the time of <hi>Germanicus Caesar;</hi> By the <hi>Greeks,</hi> particularly by <hi>Strabo</hi> it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is as the Latins express it, <hi>quasi oris merda,</hi> from the faetidness of the Mouth, a Symptom general enough here. <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that great Master of Learning and Physick, describes it to be <hi>Lien Magnus,</hi> and <hi>Illeon Haematitis</hi> from indurations of the Spleen, and fluxes of Blood, from the Bowels, of which I shall give you several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; The <hi>Lepra</hi> of the <hi>Arabians</hi> is but an higher species of this, and that I shall make evident in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>This Distemper is the nearest Epidemical in these Northern Climes, and upon the <hi>Baltick,</hi> occasion'd doubtless by the Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Air, and the living on too saline a Diet. Nor is it less raging in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> particularly in those places stiled the Salts, where there is almost continually a saline, faetid, and hazy Atmospher; which <hi>Phoenomena</hi> thoroughly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd sufficiently demonstrate its causes; which shall be more largely treated of in the ensuing Discourse of Consumptions; As to its Symptoms, and their causes, they are to be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a simple, and complicated State, the most common in a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple State are as follows; the Patient is frequently afflicted with a faetidness, and shortness of Breath, an Universal Debility, looseness of the Teeth, spots upon the Skin, and sometimes Ulcers, Pustles, Morphew, Eprysipilas, Phlegmons in the <hi>Cutis,</hi> Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick pains, violent Sweatings, numbness in the extreme Parts, Head-Achs, spitting of Corrupt putrid Blood, frequent Tooth-Achs, Gripes, Vomiting, and purging of Blood, with a sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and itching in the Skin, sometimes a Vermiculation, as if something quick crept within the Skin, intermitting Heats, and sometimes extreme Coldness, particularly on the Head, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Convulsions and Tremours, a blew Viscid spitting, and a lixivial Urine, with a pricky lateritious Sediment, and often sweet Scented, pains and swellings in the Gumms, blackness of Teeth, and inflammations of the <hi>Uvula,</hi> and Amigdilares, or Almond Glandules; This Distemper by our Modern Physicians,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61347:151"/>
especially the Learned Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> is divided into two Classes, the one he stiles an Hot, the other a Cold Scurvy; <hi>viz.</hi> a Sulphureo saline, and a saline Sulphureous, in the one the Blood being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turated with too great a quantity of Muriatick Salt, in the other too much Exalted with Sulphur; These I shall particularly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and afterwards account for the Symptoms. The cold Scurvy no doubt proceeds from too great a quantity of saline Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles abounding in the Mass of Blood, and this is evident from the Muriatick Salt, that may be prepared from the Urines of those Persons abundantly more than from others, as likewise from their extreme Salt spitting which is sometimes Vitriolick, and Aluminous. How far the Blood may be said in an hot Scurvy to be too highly exalted with Sulphur, is the next thing to be examined, Its true indeed in this Distemper there are frequent heats, and inflammations, but those may be supposed to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in the following manner; <hi>e. gr.</hi> the Bilious Particles of the Blood united with the saline ones, become of too large a size to be separated by their proper Emunctories, hence the minute Glandules of the Liver not making their due separation of the Bile, it necessarily Regurgitates into the mass of Blood, and partly thrown off by the Reins, the Urine is render'd thereby highly Lixivial, this has been made very familiar to me in the dissection of the Livers of some Persons, where all the Glandules have been highly distended, and totally obstructed by a crass, fecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Bile; which containing too great a proportion of a fixt Alkaly, and Muriatick Salt, raises a fermentation with the Juices of the Blood, and assuredly occasions those Heats, and flushings common in Scorbutick Persons; this intense Acrimony acquired, by its pointed Salts the Capillaries of the Membranes and <hi>Cutis</hi> being contracted, great pains and inflammations unavoidably ensue. These are the distinguishing Characteristics so far as I cou'd hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto observe in practice, that can fairly be accounted for in hot and cold Scorbutick cases. In the next place I proceed to give the Rationale of theSymptoms: The fetidness of the Gumms may arise from the putrefaction of the Blood in those parts, which I presume to be effected in the following manner: Those
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61347:152"/>
parts in their Natural temper being of a loose and spungy Contexture, and consisting of an infinite number of Capillary Veins and Arteries, which run not Parallel, but are interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven one with another, and compose an Aggregate of Spiral lines; hence the Blood in this case grown too grumous by the Acid Salts, more readily stagnates here, and consequently putrifies; whence proceeds that fetidness or stench of the mouth, called by the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. By the same Coagulations and Acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humours lacerating and distending the Nervous parts of the Lungs, thence unavoidably ensues a difficulty of Breathing, and sometimes a violent Haemorrhage, the Capillaries being thereby corroded, whence if the <hi>Diaeresis</hi> or Rupture be of any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vessel, the Patient frequently dies Vomiting Blood almost in an instant; TheSpirits likewise by these saline, feculent Particles become entangled, so that for want of a due distribution of them, an universal Lassitude and Debility happens: From these kind of humours likewise falling upon the Nerves, and Membranes of the Teeth, they grow loose, turn black, become hollow and decay, and thence ensue violent Tooth-Achs. By these Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Particles continually vellicating those parts, a Stupor and Numbness, I presume, must necessarily follow, from an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Spirits, Vermiculations or Creepings, Coldness, Itching, or Stinging, from the same Humours lodging upon the Muscles and Membranes, as likewise those violent Hemicranias, and Head-Achs, which are often periodical. Sometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unruly Gripes in the Stomach and Bowels, sometimes dry, at other times attended with a Diarrhaea or Purging, the one may be caused by a Saline Acrimonious Viscid Phlegme, adhering to the Coats of the Stomach and Bowels, the other by an Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Choler. It is observable these Symptoms happen fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently about the Autumnal Aequinox, and commonly after a very hot Summer, one as I presume, by the intense heat of the Weather generating too great a quantity of Bile, and the other by the North-West-Winds, common at that time of the Year which implete the Air with saline particles, which is manifest at that Season more than usual. A remarkable instance in this case
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61347:152"/>
occurs in the Philosophical Transactions, where an account is given of a Lady in <hi>America,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Clayton</hi> of <hi>Croffton</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> in the following manner. I stood at the Window, says he, and cou'd veiw the Clouds, for there small black fleeting Clouds will arise, and be swiftly carried cross the whole Element; as these Clouds arose and came nigher, her torments encreased, which were grievous as a Labouring Woman's, there was not the least Cloud but Lamentably affected her, and that at a considerable distance, but by her Shrieks, it seemed more or less according to the bigness and nearness of the Clouds. This happen'd in <hi>September,</hi> which is the time before recited in which the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms are most raging, and the Air most Nitrous and Saline; it is probable the saline Particles may stick upon the Bile, like the Prickles upon an Hedge-Hog, and occasion these tormenting Symptoms. When this Distemper arises to that, we call a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd Scurvy, its then frequently attended with spots of various Colours, as Red, Livid, Yellow, Green, and with Ulcers, Pustules, or a White Scurff, the same with the <hi>Lepra</hi> amongst the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Indians;</hi> It is certain in the Capillary Vessels of the <hi>Cutis,</hi> not running in direct but rather Spiral Lines, and forming a Retre or Net, by the stagnation of the Blood there, I say, we discover those spots of various Colours in the Skin, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different Proportions of Choler intermixed, which renders them Yellow or Green, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as the Humours acquire a more intense degree of Acrimony, it then proceeds to a solution of continuity, and those Scorbutick Ulcers grow Numerous: Lixivial fomentations are here of use, and come near to a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, an evident argument the Blood does not abound with too great a quantity of Alkalies, as <hi>Colebatch</hi> Foolishly, and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly imagins, but doubtless with too many Acid, or Acrid Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. It is true indeed, the Elesh may be corroded by an Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Alkaly, as in potential cauteries of <hi>Lap. Infernal.</hi> &amp;c. but it is not then these Ulcers are Cured again by the same kind of Alkaly, their use there wou'd rather enlarge the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; whence it necessarily follows, those Ulcers that proceed from the Habit of the Body, and are cured by Alkalies must arise from
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61347:153"/>
Acids. The next Symptom to be accounted for in this Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is the <hi>Lepra,</hi> and is as difficultly Cured as any that Occurs to Observation, its cause I take to be from Volatile Acrimonious Particles, mixt with a feculent Bile, and seperated by the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary Glands of the <hi>Cutis,</hi> discover'd by <hi>Leevenhock,</hi> and <hi>Malpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> and bursting them Concrete into a Dry, White and Yellow Furfur: That the cause of this Symptoms is from such Acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Particles, is evident from the Excoriation of the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> and the Gleeting, continual Itching, and Stinging, which are very obvious. This Symptom is not so common amongst the <hi>Europeans,</hi> as the <hi>Indians,</hi> particularly in the <hi>Mindano, Malagan,</hi> and <hi>Philippine</hi> Islands where it is almost Epidemical; the Natives there are not much disturbed at it, having a certain Cure by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables there produced, the discovery of which cou'd not yet be extorted from them by any Method whatever. In this state of the Diseases, I have frequently Salivated the Patient, and it has as often return'd, yet have more than once known it Cured by a long continuance of the Acidulae or Chalybeate Waters, cold Baths, and an universal abstinence from Flesh Meats, of which Regimen that Learned, and ingenious Gentleman, <hi>Edward Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> Doctor of Physick, and Fellow of the College of Physicians gave me the first intimation. Who some Years ago recovered a Patient at the <hi>Bath,</hi> when Bathing, and Drinking those Waters, and repeated Salivations had all been insuccessful, the Person I saw at <hi>London,</hi> in perfect Health, and I believe to this day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues so; sometimes in this Distemper there happens a flux of Blood from the Bowels, shining and black as Pitch, caused by a Rupture of the Vessels, but this Symptom being in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure accounted for before, I shall not recapitulate. By the Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidness of the <hi>Lympha</hi> in this Distemper, the Nerves that branch into the Muscles become Obstructed, hence in the hands I have often observed the <hi>Chorea Sancti Viti,</hi> or the Dance of St. <hi>Vitus,</hi> when by the Antick motions of the hands, the Persons seems to Mimick Buffoons and Juglers: And sometimes in the Thighs from a parallel cause arise those Unaccountable Convulsive Motions; that one might reasonably have concluded some living
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61347:153"/>
Animal had there taken its abode, Muscular motion is peform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by every Muscle (except the Sphincters) having its opposite, or Antagonist, hence as one Dilates the other Contracts, so that the Nerves obstructed in either of them by these Humours, such kind of motions must consequently ensue. Having now assigned the Rationale of its various Symptoms in a simple State, in the next place let us consider it as complicated with the <hi>Iaundice, Drospy, Strumas, periodic Hemicranias, Epilepsies, Vertigos,</hi> and <hi>Asthmas,</hi> and in those Enumerate only some particular instances, the Symptoms being before accounted for. As to its complicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Jaundice and Dropsy, I shall give you some instances in my ensuing Discourse of the Dropsy, which will illustrate the Hypothesis by peculiar Demonstration in the Dissections of some Persons that died of the same, I will only insert the cases of two Persons yet living, and in Health in this Town of <hi>Manchester,</hi> the one was of Mr. <hi>Iames Scot,</hi> the other of Mrs. <hi>Boulton,</hi> Wife to one of our Chaplains; the Skin was Yellow, and Livid, the Eyes Yellow, the Urine Black, and resembling Mum, its quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity small, the Appetite dejected, the Limbs swell'd, and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, a continual Thirst, and universal Weakness; these by Emollient <hi>Hydragoges, Antiscorbutics, Anteicterics, Aperitives, Stomachics,</hi> and Chalibeated Syrups prepared from <hi>Sal. Martis.</hi> were to the surprize of their acquaintance restored to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Healths: By a method not much unlike this, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Lady <hi>Leicester,</hi> of <hi>Higher-Tabley</hi> in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> who was then afflicted with the black Jaundice, a violent <hi>Hemicrania</hi> complicated with this Distemper.</p>
                  <p>One remarkable instance I will insert more, of Mr. <hi>Iohn Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> Steward to the Honourable <hi>Bartholomew Whalmesly,</hi> of <hi>Dunkenhall</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Esq</abbr> in whom these Symptoms were observable, he was incessantly tormented with an intolerable Head-Ach, to that intense degree, that even Life it self grew burdensome, and had not the Dictates of Conscience interfer'd, cou'd have acquiesced willingly in a Manumission; The Spirits by the saline Particles of the Blood, were put into such disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motions, that he often fancy'd the Persons attending him,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61347:154"/>
were inverted and stood upon their Heads, and himself too in the same Posture: at other times he imagined there was an Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sutures of the Skull, and seldom slept but in some small intervals in the Day time; his Urine was often Lixivial, and sometimes faetid, and bore upon its superficies a saline Film, where the Salts were Chrystalline, and shot into Needle like forms, or <hi>Bacilli;</hi> The points of those, I presume, occasion'd his insufferable pains; the Pulse was generally Depress'd, and Languid, but Frequent, and Vermiculating; Methods of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kinds were attempted, but in vain, as Blistring, Bleeding, Vomiting, Purging, Cupping, Antiscorbutics, Cephalics, Issues, the Cortex, Shaving the Head, all which afforded but some small intervals of ease, hence I concluded the Mass of Blood to be too deeply saturated with saline Particles to yeild to those courses; so I resolved to proceed to a Salivation, and try by that means to remove the Malady, this was affected by <hi>Calomelanos,</hi> prepared by Signiour <hi>Vigani</hi> Professour of Chymistry at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brige,</hi> and by that method he was perfectly recovered.</p>
                  <p>The general method of Cure in Scorbutick cases, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of the following intentions: First, to cleanse the first Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages by universal Evacucations, as <hi>Emetics,</hi> and <hi>Cathartics,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by Antiscorbuticks to reduce the mass of Blood to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Crasis: The forms of those are at large described by other Authors, wherefore I shall not trouble the Reader with them; I only observe this, that the best of those I have found, are the Natural Chalibeat Waters, and after due preparations, Bathing in temperate or cold Baths, as at <hi>Buxton</hi> and St. <hi>Mungus,</hi> what farther is to be done chiefly consists in Diet, which ought to be but a moderate quantity of flesh Meats, and those fresh, Antis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corbutick Teas, Fruits, Gruel, and Panadoes, these are the most remarkable things relating to this Head, so I shall close this Section.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of CONSUMPTIONS.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>COnsumptions in general as they occur to us in daily practice may be reduced into these following Classes, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick, Strumous or Chylous, or they are frequently the effects of Epidemick intermitting Fevers, or Dropsies, the Rickets, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits, Impetigo, the Chlorosis, fluor albus, Rheumatick, Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, Jaundice, of an Hernia Carnosa, spitting or Vomiting Blood, and very often the Worms.</p>
                  <p>But since the Scorbutick <hi>Phthisis</hi> rages more Familiarly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, it shall chiefly be the subject of my present Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse.</p>
                  <p>Scorbutick <hi>Phthisis</hi> may challenge three Originals contracted either from the Air, or they are Hereditary, or proceed from some error in the six Non-naturals.</p>
                  <p>I'll speak first of those that arise from the Air, they are called Stationary, or Diseases peculiar to such a place.</p>
                  <p>In those parts which abound with Marshy grounds, or where the Air is all impleted with the smoke of Pit Coal, these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions are in a manner Epidemical.</p>
                  <p>This granted, it is plain this Distemper owns its rise, and Progress, to Vitriolick, Sulphureous, Saline Particles; But to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate this Hypothesis take these following Experiments.</p>
                  <p>Drop a little Spirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> upon Spittle, there immediately ensues a White <hi>Viscous Coagulum,</hi> like what is frequently Cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in Consumptions.</p>
                  <p>Or take some of the Vitriolick Spring near <hi>Haigh</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> mix that with <hi>Saliva,</hi> you will then distinguish the Coagulation to be of an Ashy Colour, Parallel to that I have often observed in a Scorbutick <hi>Phthisis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or if you distil Kenel, there strait ascends a Vitriolick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, mix that with the Serum of the Blood, it passes strait into a very <hi>Viscous Coagulum,</hi> the same as in a Scorbutick <hi>Phthisis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:61347:155"/>
These things premised, it is evident that by Vitriolick Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the Spittle, and Serum of the Blood are render'd Viscid, and in Tast, Consistence, and Colour adequate to what we find in Scorbutick cases.</p>
                  <p>Since then as is Demonstrable by Chymistry, these Vitriolick Partricles are disunited by Fire, and fill in Crouds the circumam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient Atmosphere, and that in such an Air the <hi>Phthisis</hi> is most general and particular, it is but a rational consequence to imagine, that then these Vitriolick Particles communicated to the Mass of Blood by the Air we breath in, begin, and cherish this Stationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Phthisis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now the principal difficulty to be solved is this, how the Inhabitants bordering on Salt and Marshy Coasts, become the subjects of this Distemper, and are so much infested with it, who live only upon the products of the Fields, and altogether abstain from Meats Salted, or Dryed in Smoke, how, I say, the Air here becomes saturated with saline Particles, since Marine Salts, as is plain by Evaporation, are of a more fixed Nature than to ascend by the Heat of the Sun or the force of the Winds.</p>
                  <p>Having had several Thoughtful Essays on this subject I brought it at length to this Conclusion.</p>
                  <p>It is very clear to any Man's Observation, that these Maritime Climes abound both with Sulphureous, and Saline Particles, this Hypothesis is confirmed by the subsequent Arguments.</p>
                  <p>In the first place about Even-tide in these parts are to be seen infinite flashes, like so many Phosphors bursting from out the Earth which undoubtedly argues a Sulphur to be there, in the second place very fetid smells are often emitted like what are discernable in a Mixture of Sulphur and Salt, so that from these Salt and marshy places, Sulphureous Particles continually arising, are yet so entangl'd with Saline ones, that they bear them up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Points, and by that means impregnate all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Atmosphere; for since this <hi>Phthisis</hi> is so universal in those Airs, it is but reasonable to suppose it draws its nourishment from Sulphureous, Saline Particles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:61347:155"/>
For a farther Confirmation of this Hypothesis we may draw an <hi>Argumen te Contrario,</hi> as for instance, this Distemper is very rare where these saline Loams are wanting, hence it is that in some places of <hi>Russia,</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> for a whole Year toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will scarce hear a Person Cough, though he inhabits on the Sea Coasts, and why may it not be for the same reason that the Air in <hi>Monpelier,</hi> is become so famous against Consumptions though it borders on the <hi>Mediterranean Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When on the other hand in the first mention'd places not a Year passes, but Consumptions, Dropsies, Scorbutick intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fevers, nay whole Myriads of Diseases very severely abound, so that we may almost say of these Salt and Marshy places, as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> did of the Herb <hi>Aproxis,</hi> whose Root takes Fire like <hi>Naphtha,</hi> and by whose Effluvia the Air is renderd infectious.</p>
                  <p>It remains now that I treat of the other species of a Scorbutick <hi>Phthisis, (viz.)</hi> arising from some errour of the six Non-natnrals, and those that are Hereditary, as to the first, their causes may be explain'd by the above recited Arguments, so waving them, I'll proceed to the Scorbutick Hereditary Consumption.</p>
                  <p>It passes for an undoubted truth amongst Philosophers, and Anatomists that an Human <hi>Foetus</hi> is formed in the <hi>Ovum,</hi> but the manner how these <hi>Ova</hi> become impregnated is the Controversy.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ova</hi> are guarded by a double Membrane, and involved in their proper Coats, so that not one Drop can be squeezed from them, there are some that very zealously assert, they are impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by a certain Gas Virile, or Seminal Air; certain it is, and very obvious to us in practice, that many lab'ring under this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper have prosecuted the steps of their Fore-Fathers, although their Mothers through the whole Course of their Lives have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued strong, and healthful, some are seized with it about the same Age their Fathers were before, some perhaps sooner, some later, some have all along continued sickly and infirm, others robust, and vigorous enough, till the very seizure of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, and all this according to the different Crasis of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Virile,</hi> even as the Spirits are lodged there, or more or less depress'd, or the Saline Particles exalted, hence the very Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61347:156"/>
of Life form our different Constitutions, and so early or late the Person becomes Consumptive.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole it is my Opinion, that the <hi>Semen Virile</hi> in the <hi>Uterus</hi> is absorbed by the extremities of the Vessels, and thence communicated to the mass of Blood, which by its Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation impregnates the <hi>Ova,</hi> for how is it possible the Gout or the Stone shou'd be derived from the Father by a Seminal Air? The conclusion is very evident to the contrary; but of this I have treated before.</p>
                  <p>I shall proceed now to the Symptoms of this Disease, which I will very briefly lay down as I have Experimentally found them.</p>
                  <p>A loss of Appetite, and Strength, generally attends the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, with a straitness or compression of the Breast, a tickling Cough, the Spittle Large, Thick, White, and sometimes Yellow, Pellucid, Sky Colour'd, Faetid, Salt, Acid, Sweet, more or less, according to the Discrasy of the Blood, and the quality of the Obstruction, with profuse sweatings in the Night time, a tabidness of the Flesh, hot and cold fits alternately succeeding, the Urine Lixivial, with a very large sediment, sometimes Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and sometimes Red, many times a <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> and Gripes of the Belly torment them, with swelling of the Extreme parts.</p>
                  <p>These things observed I will now endeavour to assign the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of those Symptoms, and first, as to the loss of Appetite it may thus happen, those Glandules seated in the lower part of the Stomach, which were wont to separate subacid Humours flowing from the Arteries, by which the Nervous Fibres irritated, the Appetite was excited, but they being now clog'd with viscous Humours, are render'd very unfit for that motion, hence proceeds that loathing of Meat: That there are such Humours is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in some Persons after taking a Vomit, if we observe the great quantity of tough flegm they discharge.</p>
                  <p>By the same Viscid Humours extravasated in the Lungs, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of the Air is interrupted, hence proceeds that straitness of the Breast the Person complains of; this glutinous matter separated by the tracheal Glands is often thrown up in large quantities, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61347:156"/>
this also besmearing all the <hi>Trachaea,</hi> occasions hoarsness, the Conglobate Glandules thus stuft by these Coagulations, and the small <hi>Foramina</hi> of the Lymphaeducts at the same time obstructed; that <hi>Lympha</hi> which used to pass through them, now deprived of its proper Emunctories, regurgitates into the mass of Blood, and forces its way through unwonted Passages, and thence it happens, that by the Glands of the Wind-pipe those continued showers are distill'd as is plain in a tickling Cough.</p>
                  <p>By the same parity of reason those large sweats are so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and hence comes the <hi>Diarrhea,</hi> Gripes, and Swellings of the extreme parts.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes by these tough and clammy Humours, the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules of the Mesentery become Obstructed, and even the Chyle it self is intercepted in its Passage to the Blood, whence the whole Body rob'd of its daily nourishment, the strength decays, the Patient Emaciates, and the Excrements are often White, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lacteal Vessels disappear, just as we may observe the <hi>Milky Way in the Heavens,</hi> screened from us by interposing Clouds.</p>
                  <p>Some portions of the Chyle are precipitated by Saline Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, thence happens the spittle emitted by Cough to be white, thick, and sweetish; and sometimes urged through the Kidneys, the Urine then becomes filled with a white, and plentiful Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>By the subsidence of the Muscles, the Prognostication is O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous, as the common People apprehend, the Soul then being about to desert the Body and ready to take Wing; <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and others of the Greeks Denominate such Persons <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>The Glands of the Liver Obstructed forbid a due separation of the Bile, which rebounding into the Blood, and Fermenting there with its Acids, thence a slow Fever ensues, and the same reason may be alleged for so large, a Yellow, or Red Sediment in a Lixivial Urine.</p>
                  <p>As to the hot and cold fits successively intervening, they may very easily proceed from such a Fermentation, and so unequal a mixture of the sour Chyle in the Blood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:61347:157"/>
The Spittle as we hinted before in this Distemper is often Thick, White, and Sweet, occasion'd by a Precipitation of the Chyle upon the Lungs, and sometimes it happens to be thin, and Pellucid, commixt with Thick, this I conclude to be the <hi>Lympha</hi> which instead of passing through its proper Ducts, by reason of the obstructions of the Conglobate Glands, forces it self through other secretory Vessels; and in this case He mightily errs, who offers obstinately to stay the the Defluxion by Opiates; He might equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pretend to check the Billows in a raging Storm.</p>
                  <p>At other times the Spittle is Sky Colour'd, Salt, and Bitter, these happen as the Bile, and Salts of different species are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently intermixt.</p>
                  <p>There yet remains another familiar Symptom to be explain'd, how in this Distemper the Urine becoming so very Lixivial, and depositing so large, and red a Sediment, yet affords a very grateful and sweet smell, not unlike those Urines voided after the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Turpentine, and preparations of Sulphur, its super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies at the same time being all over-spread with a thin Oleage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <hi>Pellicle:</hi> In this case I suppose the Urine to be highly satu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with Saline, and Vitriolick Particles, the Saline Particles after their Effervessence with the Bile Precipitate it, hence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues that vast quantity of Sediment, and those two Bodies by Fermentation grow Red, just like Sulpher exalted by Fire, and thence it is the <hi>Deposita</hi> of the Urine appear so like Brick; The Saline Particles likewise in their Fermentation entangle some Oleagenous Particles, which in that hurry being forced through the Reins, and the Urine thus impregnated, being exposed to Air, these Oily Sulphureous Particles striving to disengage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, float upon the surface, and emit so pleasant on Odour, an instance like to this is in dulcifying Spirit of Nitre, with Spirit of Wine, which must necessarily strengthen the Hypothesis, where the like smell is very distinguishable.</p>
                  <p>But now the Query is, whether in this State the Lungs are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways full of Tubercles, as the Eminent <hi>Morton</hi> proposes; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess indeed in these parts the People are generally as averse to a Dissection, as an Execution, so I neither deny nor assent to it;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61347:157"/>
yet as far as I have observed in practice, I affirm, that not one Symptom of an Inflammatory Fever has appear'd in many Persons who have sunk under this Distemper; to this Opinion the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Dr. <hi>Bennet</hi> agrees, taken out of <hi>Theatr. Tabidor.</hi> pag. 96. <hi>(viz.)</hi> 
                     <q>When I practised Physick at <hi>Bristol,</hi> in that Vaulted City Consumptions were very frequent, I met with some that with no great difficulty Expectorated a sweetish Spittle, yet in the space of three Months were grown very feeble, and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, some indeed of these, though not all were much fatigu'd with Coughing, and so wasting insensibly dyed Tabid, for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in this Case we opened a certain Person, who after he had ceased Spitting a Salt Phlegm, for some time Coughed up Blood, the Lungs indeed had lost their Tone, yet both them, and the other <hi>Viscera</hi> appeared sound.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>However mistake me not as if I infer'd from this instance, that the Lungs in Consumptive Cases were never fill'd with Tuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, for I have often seen them Ulcerated: I only affirm this, that in this common <hi>Lancashire</hi> Consumption, where the Patient suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a daily decay, and continually throws off a Thick, and White Spittle, in the beginning, I say, and encrease of this Distemper, the Lungs cou'd not be pierced, nay I have known many die without one Symptom of an Hectick, through the whole course of the Disease, so that we may reasonably conclude their Lungs cou'd not be Ulcerated.</p>
                  <p>Proceed we now to treat of the <hi>Phthisis</hi> in a confirmed state, and here we may observe Nature every day declining, insomuch that the Mass of Blood contracting a very Vitriolic habit; the Spittle tasteth like Alom, or Salt of Steel, and now it is the Saline Particles range at Large, and know no bounds, now the Fever becomes more continued and strong, by Fermentation of the Vitriolic, and Sulphureous Particles; as when you mix Oil of Vitriol, and Oil of Turpentine together.</p>
                  <p>By this Effervescence the Capillary Vessels of the Cheeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come distended, hence happens that fixed red Colour on both sides the Face, a certain signal of approaching Death; just like
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61347:158"/>
the last efforts of a Lamp deprived of Oil, it flashes and expires, or like a setting Sun, gilding red all the Hemisphere.</p>
                  <p>The Conglobate Glandules thus more and more Obstructed, and a greater quantity of the Nutritious juice being daily precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, a thicker and more plentiful Spittle follows, by the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolic Particles commixt with the Sulphur of the Blood, and hence ensues a smell like that of Faetid Fish.</p>
                  <p>The Lungs at length oppress'd with an uncommon weight of Phlegm, the Patient becomes Asthmatical, and finds a continual burden upon his Breast, and in this case I have known the Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to be extraordinary Faetid, yet not always proceeding from Ulcers of the Lungs, as some assure us, for how cou'd those Persons be free from a <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> and sweats, when the Lungs are all penetrated with Ulcers; The cause of this stench may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be attributed to Volatile Sulphureous Particles, pointed with Saline Ones, with which the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood abounding they commix with the <hi>Saliva,</hi> for the Sulphureous Particles apt enough to fly off, bear along with them the Saline Ones, and strike up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sensory, and affect it with a Nauseous smell; When on the contrary Sulphureous Particles, <hi>per se,</hi> disentangl'd from SalineOnes, touch upon the Olfactory Fibres, produce a very grateful scent, as is Evident in the Effluvias of Aromatick and Balsamick Flowers, and now the Nutritious juice Expectorated in vast quantities, the <hi>Facies Hippocratica,</hi> and a <hi>Marasmus</hi> of the whole Body is the consequence.</p>
                  <p>The Conglobate Glands being still more Obstructed, and the Blood all degenerated into a Saline temper, the Patient is now afflicted with profuse sweats, violent Diarrhaeas, with acute pains like those in Rheumatisms almost intolerable, some complaining of Pains in the Bones, in whom there is not the least suspicion of the <hi>Lues Venerea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One Symptom more remains not less common than the rest, and worthy our highest regard, in many Persons emaciated to meer Skeletons, and reduced even to the last Extremity, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite yet remains good and laudable, nor is any Hectick heat the effect of Eating, no Sweats nor Diarrhaeas nor inflation of the Stomach, attend the Patients, and yet they insensibly wast away,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61347:158"/>
throwing up a large quantity of Thick, and White Plegm.</p>
                  <p>From what has been said we may sufficiently gather, that the Natural ferment of the Stomach sharpned with the Vitriolick Particles of the Blood, irritate its Nervous Fibres: The Spirits thus excited, produce a quicker motion, and promote the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, which, <hi>Ostrich</hi> like, covets and dissolves whatever is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, hence passing through the Lacteals, and Chyliferous Ducts it enters the Mass of Blood, and is there by the Saline Particles precipitated into Thick, and unnutritive Humours, incapable to transpire by Sweat, or descend by <hi>Diarrhaeas,</hi> but subside in the Lungs, and by that means the party continually declines.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another remarkable Symptom under this Head, that an irregular intermitting Fever seizes very many almost spent with this Distemper, some it assaults only once, others twice or thrice in the space of Twenty four Hours; It rushes on with great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order with an Itching betwixt the Scapulas and Loins: The whole Body trembling is render'd Convulsive, and an intense heat succeeds, and after that sweats, and sometimes a looseness; what can these Reciprocal returns of Heat, and Coldness proceed from? But from sharp Salt Humours extravasated upon the Nervous Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, upon the Extremities of the Nerves, and the subcutaneous Miliary Glands, these parts being saturated to excess, and Vellicated by their Acrimony, of course produce those Chilling Pains, but at Length the Humours being absorbed by the extremities of the Vessels, and then mixing with the Blood, a new Fermentation with the Sulphureous Particles arises, and so the Feverish heat renews; The Morbifick matter at length overcome is cast off by Sweat or Siege.</p>
                  <p>I have known some who in a State of Health, have been of a very pleasing and agreeable Disposition, yet being much worn out by this Distemper, have grown very fretful and peevish, and so violently Passionate, that they cou'd scarce endure to see, or hear any one speak; this must needs be the effect of the sour juices of the Blood, that nettle, and enrage the Spirits.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, something might be added here concerning the other Species of Consumptions, those that are either Hereditary,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61347:159"/>
or arise from some errour of living, but since their Symptoms are observed to be much the same, it is but reasonable to suppose their Originals so too.</p>
                  <p>Every State of the Consumption might be Illustrated with Parallel Histories, as likewise the Methods of Cure might here be proposed, but those being accounted for before in my <hi>Phthisio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia Lancastriensis,</hi> to that I refer you.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>I Shall now proceed to treat of the Dropsy which the <hi>Greeks</hi> divide into three Species, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The <hi>Timpanites,</hi> the <hi>Ascites,</hi> and <hi>Anasarca,</hi> the <hi>Timpanites</hi> receives its Denomination from its Sound, the <hi>Ascites</hi> from the Figure it represents of a Bottle, or the <hi>Uterus,</hi> and the <hi>Anasarca</hi> from an ill Habit contracted in the <hi>Muscular</hi> parts, but to reconcile the different Opinions of the Ancient and Moderns, which are near as Numerous as their several Authors, would be to as slender purpose, as to Command the Winds raging in a Storm: I therefore only take notice of some topping Hypotheses, and so give you my own Opinion; The causes assigned by the Ancients for Dropsies, were either a <hi>Flatus</hi> as the <hi>Timpanites,</hi> or else a Weakness of the Liver, and thence by a defect of Sanguification ensued the <hi>Ascites</hi> and <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarca;</hi> According to our Celebrated <hi>Willis,</hi> the <hi>Timpanites</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a Convulsive motion of the Stomach, called <hi>Tetanus,</hi> disturbing its Nervous Fibres; This Opinion seems to me very improbable, for how can a Convulsive motion in that part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue so equally for so many Years: I have known many afflicted with the <hi>Timpany</hi> and all along have digested well their Food, have been free from Thirst, and disturb'd neither with Sweats nor Gripes, their Urine has been plentiful and laudable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, which agreeable Symptoms cou'd never happen, was the Stomach still inflated with such a Convulsive motion; as to the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61347:159"/>
other species of the Dropsy, he alleges, they arise from the Mass of Blood become Acid and Vapid, and the Chyle by that means render'd incapable to assimilate it self to it, but how this <hi>Discrasia</hi> comes in that point he is silent; which, in its proper place, I will endeavour to disclose. What our Eminent <hi>Sydenham</hi> Writes concerning this Disease, respects chiefly the Practice, to whose Works I refer you; The late Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> asserts their causes to arise from the Conglobate Glandules grown Schirrous, which tumefying burst the Lymphatick Vessels, but his errour in this will very plainly appear in a Dissection or two I shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in. The Learned Dr. <hi>Lister</hi> in his Exercitation of Dropsies, positively assigns the Origin of this Disease, to proceed from a defect of the first Concoction, and from the Stomach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inflamed ev'n to a Cauterisation, but his mistake in this, as in many other things, shall be briefly shewn.</p>
                  <p>I do here affirm, I have known many Dropsical Persons through the whole Course of the Disease retain a very good Digestion, and their Urine both in quantity and quality agreeable enough, which things consider'd, it is beyond the Power of Sense to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile those Placid Symptoms to a Stomach so highly inflamed; It now remains, with the leave of so many Eminent Authors, that I propose my own Opinion, which I am far from positively as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting, but shall fairly refer it to the judgment of the Learned World: The Dropsy then may be divided into two species only, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Bilious and Lymphatick; I call that Bilious, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thick condensated Choler, Obstructing both the Glands and Biliary Pores of the Liver, hence the Bile deny'd a due sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the Lymphatick Vessels, both in the Liver, Kidneys, and others parts of the Body, become distended, and at length burst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, produce indifferently, either the <hi>Ascites</hi> or <hi>Anasarca.</hi> The Lymphatick Dropsy arises from a Viscid <hi>Lympha,</hi> producing the same effects in those Vessels as are alleged above; the Aetiology whereof shall in what follows be explain'd.</p>
                  <p>That the Dropsy may proceed from thick Coagulated Choler, is confirmed by the Examination the Learned <hi>Sylvius</hi> makes of its Principles; it consists of a Lixivial Volatile and Oily Salt, very
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61347:160"/>
apt for Fermentation with any Acid, and thence according to the different Genius of the Acid, different effects are produced; let us then imagine the Bilious Particles either in the first Passages, or in the mass of Blood, alter'd from their Natural Crasis by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, Acid, Muriatick, or other Acrid Bodies, by which means the Bile becomes faeculent, perhaps not unlike Vitriolated Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; The Glands of the Liver hence become Obstructed, and its due secretion forbidden, they then swell beyond a common Compass, and the Particles rush <hi>qua via datur</hi> into the Lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Vessels, which they must necessarily Distend, and Lacerate; it is very common to our Observation, that where ever this fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent matter is deposited the part tumifies even to a solution of continuity, from whence a Yellow Liquor continually distills, of a bitter Pungent tast, which is a certain Argument of its being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turated with Bilious Particles.</p>
                  <p>The Kidneys likewise obstructed by this faeculency, we find the Urine to be small, and of an high Colour, not unlike <hi>Brums<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> Mum, its sediments Yellow, and often times Black and Red, the Tongue Yellow and Dry, a continual Thirst, Pungent Pains all over the Body, and a general Lassitude: In these despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Circumstances Mankind lives like an Amphibious Animal, and in a Deluge of Waters breathing in Air, hence through defect of Inspiration that difficulty of breathing ensues.</p>
                  <p>As to the Lymphatick Dropsy it may thus happen, the Saline Particles of the Blood, as was alleged before in the Treatise of Consumptions, according to their different species Coagulating the Mass of Blood, in what ever part of the Body they are nest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there assuredly they condense the <hi>Lympha,</hi> and render it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinous like the Whitesof Eggs, and so consequently must swell and burst the Vessels as is above recited; One thing in this kind of Dropsy is worthy our taking notice of, that the Patient is not disturbed with Thirst, the Urine in quantity and quality laudable, the Appetite rather too craving than dejected, no pains invade, save that of bearing about so heavy a mass of Water, and this sort of Dropsy is more incident to Women than Men, and though it has hitherto been mistaken for a <hi>Timpanites,</hi> it is truly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61347:160"/>
a Dropsy of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> the Lymphaeducts of which Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane are burst, and its Glandules highly tumify'd, hence and no otherwise ensues the <hi>Timpanites,</hi> as shall be render'd appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by the following Histories.</p>
                  <p>For a farther confirmation I refer you to <hi>Nuck, Ettmullerus,</hi> and <hi>Iuncken.</hi> From what has been said the causes of the <hi>Ascites,</hi> and <hi>Anasarca</hi> may be easily deduced, wherefore I shall not insist longer on their Aetioligies, but shall proceed to illustrate our Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis in the following cases.</p>
                  <p>The first, shall be of Mr. <hi>Iohn Leeds,</hi> Bachelour of Physick, who practised many Years in this Town of <hi>Manchester,</hi> he was seized with the Black Jaundice, upon which ensued, an <hi>Ascites,</hi> and <hi>Anasarca;</hi> no endeavours were wanting to relieve him, and no Methods of Physick unessay'd to Cope with the Disease, but in vain; generally Belov'd, and now as generally Lamented, he Expired: through the whole course of his Distemper, his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion was good, his Thirst little or nothing, at which I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, his Urine but small, yet for Colour and Consistence like <hi>Brumswick</hi> Mum, with a Black Sediment, his Body was Emaciated, and his Countenance Ghastly and Wan; towards his latter end, a Cough was very troublesome to him: His Body being opened, thirty six Pints of a Yellow bitter Water was discharged from the Abdomen, there was little or none of the Omentum remaining, the Stomach was some what contracted but no ways inflamed, the Spleen retained its Natural Colour and State, the Conglobate Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules were of a sutable Magnitude, neither schirrous nor fumify'd, the Lacteal Vessels as much as I observed of them no ways alter'd.</p>
                  <p>But when the Liver was exposed, its whole substance was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durated, inscision being made into it, those Glands first disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>Malpigius,</hi> were turgent, and large as common Hail Stones, all impleted with a faeculent CrassBile; from the whole it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably apparent, this must be a Bilious Dropsy and Challenges no Original, either from the Stomach inflamed, or the Conglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Glands indurated, but only from a faeculent Bile obstructing both the Glandules of the Liver, and its Lymphatick Vessels: How the Bile becomes thus degenerated is before Explain'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:61347:161"/>
The next instance Parallel to this is of Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Iohn Williams,</hi> in Her late Majesty's Regiment of Dragoons, he was seized with the Black Jaundice, at his Quarters in <hi>Manchester,</hi> the same Ominous Symptoms ensued, as in the preceding Case, he swelled gradually in the Belly, his Urine in Colour and Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity as is above recited, yet his Digestion was laudable enough, and his Thirst not troublesome; the <hi>Ascites,</hi> and <hi>Anasarca</hi> came on a pace, all our attempts in the Physical way, gave only some intervals of ease, alleviated indeed, but removed not the main Obstructions; for several Weeks he kept regularly to a course of Physick and Diet, towards the end of his Distemper his Cough was violently tedious, and the swellings of his Thighs, and Legs fatigued him with a constant uneasiness, insomuch, that all Rest interrupted, ev'n Life it self grew burdensome; thus every Day declining, his Manly Soul at length took flight: About twenty four Pints of Water were taken out of the Cavity of the Abdomen; the <hi>Omentum</hi> was not so much consumed as in Mr. <hi>Leeds;</hi> the Stomach, Spleen, and all the other <hi>Viscera</hi> were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial enough, except the Liver, where the same Scene was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to us as before, and from whence unquestionably all that Tragick Series of Mortal Symptoms arose.</p>
                  <p>It was easy to account for many more of the like cases, where the same unhappy Train of consequences attended, but these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particular Dissections, I fairly in them appeal to a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.</p>
                  <p>I shall now descend to illustrate my Hypothesis of the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick Dropsy by the following instance.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Heywood</hi> living at the <hi>Roades</hi> near <hi>Manchester,</hi> aged about Fifty Eight; for four Years was afflicted with the <hi>Tympany,</hi> all along she Eat her Food, and Digested it will, was clear and free from Thirst, her Urine was plentiful enough, nor was her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance any ways alter'd from an healthful Complexion, and save for the increase of the Tumour of the Abdomen, she was other wise very hearty, and sprightly, she had gone through all the Classes of Physick, but alas! The Numerous Prescripts of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Physicians were all unsuccessful; Her case was sent up
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61347:161"/>
to the <hi>London</hi> Physicians, where different Opinions, directed diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent methods, whether they had not rightly the Case stated to them, or that the distance of place precluded their nicer Observations, I cannot be positive, but all endeavours were in vain; Her Belly still encreasing to the Magnitude of a large Globe, she sunk beneath the Load: Full seventy Pints of Water, the greater part very Viscous, were discharg'd from the Cavity, the Muscles of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> were all Emaciated, and the <hi>Omentum</hi> totally consumed; The <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum</hi> was full five Inches thick, whose <hi>Duplicature</hi> formed a very large <hi>Sacculus,</hi> all repleted with Schirrous Glandules highly tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mify'd, and pellucid <hi>Vesicules,</hi> as big as the common bunches of Grapes, the Liquor contained in these Bladders, was like the Whites of Eggs clear and Gelatinous; The Stomach, Spleen, Liver, Mesentery, as much as I cou'd perceive of them were in a pure Natural State, nor were the <hi>Ovaria</hi> impleted with those <hi>Vesicules,</hi> but appeared very sound; These were the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable things to be taken notice of, and doubtless the case was what is generally call'd a <hi>Timpany;</hi> which notwithstanding if we'll but Credit our Eyes, arose neither from a <hi>Tetanus</hi> of the Stomach, nor as the Ancients wou'd have it, from the flatness, or vapours of the <hi>Abdomen;</hi> But meerly from the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick Vessels of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> distended, and burst.</p>
                  <p>I had two cases sent me, by the Learned Dr. <hi>Griffith,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided at <hi>Warrington</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> in the Year 1696. since re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>Dublin,</hi> the one was in all Circumstances like the last mention'd, so I shall forbear to relate it; In the other the <hi>Uterus</hi> proved to be the seat of the Tumour from whence about sixteen Pints of very putrid Water were Emitted, his account may be seen at large in my 54 <hi>Exercitationes,</hi> Printed at <hi>Oxford.</hi> From all which it is abundantly Demonstrable, that this Lymphatick Dropsie arises from the <hi>Lympha</hi> renderd Viscid by Saline Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, for did it proceed from the Inflammation of the Bowels, or Glandules, the Patients wou'd assuredly be afflicted with thirst, and complain of Heat, whereas neither was a grievance. Yet mistake me not as if I imagin'd every Lymphatick Dropsy to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> I only assert that Dropsy which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd the <hi>Timpany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:61347:162"/>
The other Species, as well the <hi>Ascites</hi> as <hi>Anasarca,</hi> may happen in any part of the Body abounding with Lympheducts; The <hi>Timpany</hi> likewise in other Membranous Parts may form <hi>Cistus's</hi> and <hi>Vesicules,</hi> as in the <hi>Uterus,</hi> or the <hi>Cornua Uteri,</hi> or many other places, but most frequently in the <hi>Peritonaeum;</hi> Whoever has a desire to be farther informed how these <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datides</hi> are formed in the Lymphatick Vessels by Mercurial injections into those Vessels, he may soon satisfie his Curiosity.</p>
                  <p>And now as to Dr. <hi>Listers</hi> Hypothesis, the Query is whether Dropsies arise sometimes from the Stomach in a manner cauterized, or from the <hi>Tunica Villosa</hi> of the Stomach, having lost its Tone, as the Learned <hi>Willis</hi> wou'd have it, for my part I believe from both causes, as I have seen from many dissections; But though it be allow'd that Dropsies often arise from continued Debauches, and surfeited Habits of Bodies, it does not thence follow that all the Species of Dropsies spring from the same Origin: For how cou'd it possibly be I beseech you, that many Persons Temperate to a wonder, shou'd yet so commonly die Hydropical? As may be daily observed in them that are worn out, and almost spent with lingring Fevers, and all Cacochymical, and Scorbutick constitutions; I profess sincerely there is not any distemper tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more to the discredit of Physicians, than the several Species of Dropsies: Hydragogues, Antiscorbuticks, and Diureticks, of all degrees and kinds, I have known too often unsuccessfully used, so cou'd heartily wish for the good of Human kind some other more happy methods were discover'd.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure in general of this Distemper, there are Specimens sufficient in most Authors, I shall not therefore fill these Sheets with a Train of <hi>Recipes,</hi> but shall only touch upon Two uncommon Heads, and refer them to the Learned World.</p>
                  <p>The first shall be of the Pills prescribed by <hi>Crato,</hi> and his own disquisition upon them, which are as follows, ℞ <hi>Terebinth. Clarae</hi> ℥ <abbr>ss</abbr> 
                     <hi>aq. Adianthi</hi>

of which he thus descants, the Turpentine though in greatest quantity, yet conduces much to the opening of the Urinary pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, and strengthens the Entrails, the other Correctives are for the sake of the <hi>Cantharides,</hi> as the Mastic, Rhubarb, Cinnamon and the Oil, how far these Pills may benefit, or what improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be added, I have not yet Experienced, but can see no reason why <hi>Cantharides</hi> may not be render'd as safe and wholesome a Medicine, as Corrosive Sublimate, from which our Famous <hi>Calomelanos</hi> is prepared; why may not the Volatile Salt of those Flies, though highly Corrosive, be matched with an equal Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectour. <hi>Bartholine</hi> commends an infusion of them, and if the Eminent Dr. <hi>Lister</hi> had directed his infusion of them, in the Dropsy as well as in the <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> I believe he had not mist the mark.</p>
                  <p>The second Question is of no small moment, whether a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Salivation may not be of advantage in this Distemper, the great effects that method produces in Scrophulous, Scorbutick, and Venereal cases, are apparent to all the World, when all other endeavours have failed; and since Dropsies generally arise and bloom from the like Vitiated Ferment, why may not the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess be as answerable too?</p>
                  <p>That the Blood is effaete and vapid in Dropsies is evident enough, from whence some Object the whole Oeconomy of the Body is too infirm for that Course; But whence is it this Debility of the Blood arises? Is it not from Saline Particles abounding in the Mass of Blood? And how can the Body be more effectually, and readily freed from them than by the proper Emunctories, the Salivating Ducts; Nature her self methinks points us out the Road: To conclude, my advice is this, whilst the Viscera remains sound, let this or some other promising method be Essay'd, to relieve the Languishing Patient.</p>

I will give you one instance of a Dropsy proceeding from an unweildy fatness; it was of Mr. <hi>Richard Heap,</hi> Bachelour of Arts, and Usher of <hi>Manchester</hi> School, who as I conjectured had labour'd under a Dropsy, and an <hi>Hernia Intestinalis,</hi> for near two Years; for all the Integuments of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> were suspended like a large Satchel betwixt his Thighs, and were no little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him in Walking, various Methods were Essay'd, and for about Twelvemonths he seem'd to be relieved, but the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Winter his Distemper renew'd, and in the space of three Weeks an Hundred and Twenty Pints of faetid Water, Issued through the <hi>Velamina</hi> of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> which at length Sphacela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting he dy'd; His Body being opened, the substance of the <hi>Cutis</hi> was found to be very Schirrous, over all the Region of the Groin, the <hi>Membrana adiposa</hi> was full seven Inches Thick, the Stomach, Liver, Spleen, Intestines, and Mesentery Glandules, were in a sound and healthful State; The <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> was entire and firm, a Corner of which Membrane pierced through the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Liver, and adher'd to the Vertebrae of the Spine, there were betwixt Twenty and Thirty <hi>Saccule's</hi> of Fat about the size and shape of Pears, that adhered to the Bowels, but within the Cavity not one Spoonful of Water: Through all his Distemper, he Eat, Drank, and Digested well, and plentifully, had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Thirst, and voided Urine in quantity sufficient, and only that the swelling daily encreased, he was otherwise no ways indisposed; This must needs ensue from that weighty substance of Fat pressing upon the Lymphatick Vessels, and thence Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing the due Secretion of the <hi>Lympha,</hi> the Dropsy followed.</p>
                  <p>Having thus as briefly, and comprehensively as possible run through this large Field of Chronical Diseases, from which Hypotheses many other Corallaries may be deduced, I shall now descend to treat of acute and intermitting Distempers, and so close the Chapter.</p>

                  <p>THere is scarce any Year but the Fever receives some new Appellation from the common People, but those Fevers that rage chiefly amongst us at set Seasons, as the Spring and Fall, may be reduced to these two Heads; They are either inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, malignant, intermittent Fevers, or they are simply inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent: In all the Learned Treatises yet Extant on this subject, nothing is more familiar to us than an inflammation of the Blood, but what is meant by inflammation seems yet to me to be unsolved; The Greeks divide inflammations into two Species, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and these two Terms are taken either in a large or strict Sense; when at large they mean any immoderate flushing Momentaneous heat, that appears without a Tumour, such as present themselves daily in Scorbutick Cases; But when strictly taken they signify to us a severe hot swelling, red, and painful in the fleshy Parts of the Body, proceeding from a Collection and stagnation of over-heated Blood, Violently flowing upon the Part, and disturbing all the inferiour Orders of Vessels around it, but these distinctions of inflammations our Modern Authors take no notice of; our Celebrated <hi>Sydenham</hi> makes no difference betwixt Malignity and Inflammation, but as the Blood is more or less Inflamed, so is the Malignity greater or less; as for Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it self he condemns it as a subterfuge of ignorance, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains not what he means by inflammation of the Blood, his whole performances rather delineate to us the effects, than causes of inflammation; The Eminent <hi>Morton</hi> says, the inflammation continues until the Febrile Poyson, the Primary cause of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, is either expell'd by Art or Nature, or that the Spirits sink under it: by which account it is very plain he places the causes of inflammation, in a certain Poyson oppressing or destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61347:164"/>
the Spirits, but passes by in silence what that Poison is, so Noxious to Human kind, so that the inflammation of the Blood, thus accounted for amounts to no more, nor gives us any clearer Idea of its Aetioligy, than that <hi>Archaeus</hi> of <hi>Helmont,</hi> a meer riddle to himself and all the World, or that Light within which directs to greater Obscurity; <hi>Wepfer</hi> was in the right of it, when he takes notice of <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Ferment, that it was neither Substance, nor Accident, neither Man, Woman, nor Hermophrodite; so consequently nothing. True indeed he acknowledges various Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Poisons, but reduces their Operations all to Occult quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to attempt their Explications, as he alleges, is only a Philosophical trifling; but with the leave of so Eminent an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, let us take Oil of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> Spirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> or any other <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum,</hi> we may readily discern their Effects, in Corroding of Flesh, or Coagulating the Blood, or by a <hi>Menstruum</hi> prepared from <hi>Cantharides,</hi> the like <hi>Phoenomena</hi> are produced, and all arise from a like cause, but must it be no less than madness it self to endeavour their <hi>Analisis?</hi> And must they altogether be solved by Occult qualities? If the matter stands thus, how comes it that a Philosopher of the first Class, is Eminent beyond a Noisy Mountebank? Or in relation to Physick, how comes it that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Physician, out-strips a vulgar Emperick? Let us suppose a Person making his Observations with Microscopes, whether shall we solve the different <hi>Phoenomena</hi> there, by different refracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or by Occult qualities? No one certainly in his Senses wou'd take the last for a Rational reply; This I know, that Sulphureous, Saline, and Oleaginous Poisons, may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd out of various Bodies, nor does it seem unreasonable to me, their different effects shou'd be solved by certain Principles: For my part let them Delight that will in Darkness, and by dusky Notions obscure the sight of Mankind, I shall think it no Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour freely to Essay a solution of causes, and perhaps to will in some is to effect it.</p>

                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:61347:164"/>
To set aside all Controversies of this Nature, I will briefly explain what I mean by Malignity or Inflammation of the Blood, by an Inflammation of the Blood, I mean a Coagulation of its Serous Parts, proceeding from certain, Saline, Austere, Acid, or Acrid Particles: For confirmation of which Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis, take the following Experiments: In the first place, Let Alum or Vitriol be mingled with the Serum of the Blood, it straitways passes into a sizy Viscous <hi>Coagulum,</hi> like what is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable on the superficies of the Blood in Malignant inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Distempers.</p>
                  <p>In the second place, Scorbutick Persons, Drinkers of Wine, and the Inhabitants near the Sea-Coasts, whose Blood doubtless abounds with such Particles, are above others subject to these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers, or how comes it that Bezoardick Medicines are of such Efficacy here, unless by absorbing or otherwise altering these Saline Particles, for Particles of different kinds will exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and shew their Power; that the Animal Spirits by these Medicaments are expanded, and excited as some affirm, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess is true, but thus I imagine it to be Effected, not that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines immediately act upon the Spirits, but by destroying the Saline Particles, they dissove the Coagulation of the Blood, and hence the Animal Spirits unfetter'd, in a constant, and continued Course perform their waving Motions, and like the Sun darting its rays through all the enlighten'd Hemisphere, actuate the whole Microcosm, and those Noble actions of the Spirits display them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which were almost extinct in a Viscous <hi>Lympha,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared only as a Star twinkling in an hazy Air, and diffused only some Languid Motions, through the whole frame of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; that saying of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> agrees with this <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is an interception of the Spirits in the Veins, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd by a severe Obstruction there; for this reason it is, that <hi>Camphir,</hi> a Natural <hi>Sal. Volat. Oleos.</hi> is so much applauded in Pestilential Diseases, by <hi>Iunken, Ettmullerus,</hi> and others, and this I Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally speak, that for two or three Years past, I made use of <hi>Electuar. de Ovo,</hi> in which <hi>Camphir</hi> is an ingredient, and met with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable success in Malignant Pestilential Fevers, and judge it equal
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61347:165"/>
to the Noblest <hi>Alexipharmics,</hi> from the whole we conclude, that the more or less these Saline Particles are Malignant or Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory, the Distemper is more or less Acute or Pestilential: For a farther illustration, if we drop a little Spirit of <hi>Nitre</hi> into Blood immediately taken out of the Arm, it produces even in the twinkling of an Eye, a Black Viscous <hi>Coagulum,</hi> which a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of <hi>Vitriol</hi> effects but very slowly, and hence it is these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers are sometimes called Essential, Spurious, and sometimes Scorbutick, which is attributed to the solutions of Salts of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Kinds, Coagulating the <hi>Lympha,</hi> and Contracting, and Vellicating the Membranes, Nerves, and all the Limbs of the Body, but against this Hypothesis these Objections occur.</p>
                  <p>First, In inflammatory Distempers it very often happens the Blood is diluted, so consequently cannot be Coagulated, as is evident from the frequent large returning Haemorrhagies, and from the use of Acids, and a slender diet in these Cases.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In these Distempers the very first Symptoms some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appear in the <hi>Genus Nervosum,</hi> and produce <hi>Deliriums,</hi> continual Watchfulness, and Convulsive motions, wherefore it may seem reasonable they do not always proceed from a Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, but rather from the <hi>Genus Nervosum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To these I reply,</p>
                  <p>That doubtless there are Poisons of various Kinds, some of which fuse and others Coagulate the Blood, as in that Disease called the <hi>Plica Polonica,</hi> and others; but the present Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy is not about these: we only enquire now whether those Distempers called inflammatory amongst us, whether, I say, in those the Blood is Coagulated or Colliquated, that is made to fluid.</p>
                  <p>To the first Objection I answer, though there happen some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Violent Haemorrhagies in these Cases, yet these arise from a Coagulation of the Blood, in this manner, in many of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary Vessels the Blood being either Coagulated, or through its Viscidity moving slowly, and still pressed forwards from the larger Vessels, urges its passages through other Ramifications, and hence ensues that expence of Blood through the Nostrils, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Stomach, and Womb at Critical Seasons, which with Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61347:165"/>
the Patient many time expires; yea, very often we observe that even in those Persons these Haemorrhagies hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, whose Blood upon the opening of a Vein appear'd Black and Sizy, which is an undeniable Demonstration of its Viscidness. To these may be added the frequent fluxes of Blood in Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Cases, where the Blood is unquestionably condensed, as the Purple Livid Spots abundantly evince: And in these Persons, <hi>Testaceous</hi> Powders, preparations of Steel, Mineral Waters Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or Artificial, Challenge the first Class, either in absorbing or altering the Saline Particles, and so promoting a free circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Blood. In the second place, as to what relates to Acids, we may allege with <hi>Wedelius,</hi> that they both Coagulate and dissolve a Coagulation of the Blood, and for this reason may be of Excellent use in these cases; besides, yet there are Acids which Act upon each other, as Spirit of <hi>Niter</hi> and Oil of <hi>Vitriol, Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Marine</hi> Salt, and thence are converted into a third substance, by the same parity of reason tho' the cause of inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Distempers may be deduced from a Coagulation of the Blood, or <hi>Lympha</hi> from Saline Particles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet there are Acids of different kinds, imagine the juice of Berberies, or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or Gas Sulphuris, by adhering to the Saline Particles, Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating the Blood and Nested there, by their adhesion, thus they become so far alter'd and augmented in bulk; that they are render'd incapable to penetrate the Lymphatick Globules, or coalesce longer with them, whence the circulation returns, the Blood reassumes its wonted vigour, and the Distemper ceases.</p>
                  <p>To the third thing of a slender Diet being given in these cases, as Gruels, Panado's, and Posset Drink, it is certain that these given in large quantities dilute the Saline Particles, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Lympha</hi> fluid, and by that means assist the circulation, and hence are of Extraordinary use.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth I answer, That some Saline Particles are of so Active and Penetrating a Nature, That ev'n in a moment of time they may be transfer'd to the <hi>Genus Nervosum,</hi> as is observable in that Sulphurous <hi>Halitus</hi> near Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> where a Dog instantly grows Convulsive, and expires without Speedy relief. Let us imagine then when in the beginning of the Distemper such severe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61347:166"/>
Symptoms attend, the Morbifick Ferment to be Acrid and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile, such perhaps as Spirit of <hi>Niter,</hi> by these Corrosive Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles smartly irritating the Nervous Fibres, and Whirling them into twisting Motions, and at the same time Coagulating the <hi>Lympha,</hi> sometimes the Patient is Molested with Wakefulness, and Convulsive motions, sometimes a deep and heavy <hi>Coma,</hi> or becomes Paralitick, or Apoplectick; the Animal Spirits thus entangled in a Viscid <hi>Lympha,</hi> cannot be seperated from the Nerves, which now deprived of their wonted <hi>Pabulum,</hi> the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son becomes Pallid, like the Image of Death.</p>
                  <p>But against these Assertions, there yet remains one Powerful Argument, and urged Vehemently by Persons of no common Fame; <hi>(Viz.) That no Acid cou'd ever yet be produced from the Mass of Blood by any Art yet known;</hi> to Vindicate which the Learned <hi>Boyle</hi> is very often quoted, who cou'd never by any Experiment whatever effect it.</p>
                  <p>But to that I thus reply,</p>
                  <p>That all the Experiments try'd by that Eminent Philosopher, were only on the Grumous part of the Blood, as I remember, not in the <hi>Lympha,</hi> but in the Massy Red Body of the Blood, the Saline Particles are so involv'd with others of a different kind, that they are not distinguishable by the tast, and sight, nor can they be separated by any Art of Fire, but only by their proper Emunctories, <hi>(Viz.)</hi> The Lymphatick Vessels, and Glandules of the Body, as is evident in very many instances; for pray tell me whoever yet cou'd separate one Particle of Bile or Urine from the Blood? Or what Person will deny such Liquors are therein contain'd? Besides, it passes for an undoubted Truth, as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable, that the Lymphatick Vessels are only <hi>Compages</hi> of small Arteries, and consequently whatever is contain'd in them, first passed through the Arteries; this granted it is beyond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, the <hi>Lympha</hi> sometimes affords an Acid; the truth of this is confirmed by the Learned <hi>Nuck,</hi> who by many repeated Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments knew how to discover an Acid in the Aqueous Humor of the Eye, which by a peculiar Lymphatick Vessel is separated from the Artery; for this Humour is only brought thither by the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61347:166"/>
                     <hi>ramuli</hi> of the Carotide Artery. I'll annex one Argument more, that if no Acid be contain'd in the Blood how comes it, I beseech you, that in Carious or Virulent Ulcers, the Silver Probe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes instantly of a Livid Colour, which can only be effected by an Acid not an Alkalious <hi>Menstruum?</hi> or what causes the Spittle of many Consumptive Persons to be like a solution of Alome? That Argument will not abide the Test, set forth by a late Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler in assigning the causes of Distempers to Alkalies not Acids, but like his New Light to Surgery vanishes like a wandering Star. <hi>In the Gout or Stone,</hi> says he, <hi>a Chalky matter is depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited in the Ioints, Reins, and Bladder, fermenting with any Acid, so consequently of an Alkalious Nature, therefore these Distempers arises rather from Alkalies than Acids.</hi> We allow it to be true indeed, that those Bodies may be reputed Alkalies, for from them Volatile Alkalies may be prepared, but whoever deny'd Alkalies to be contained in the Blood? Or what then? Does this prove the consequences, that they produce Distempers? no more if I mistake not than the frothy Spittle of Epileptick Persons demonstrates the causes of their Convulsions, or the Ocre of Mineral Waters discloses their Principles. We allege then that in those Distempers the Blood having acquir'd a Saline, Acid, Austere, or Acrid Temper, and in that case commixing with the Alkalies of the Blood, become like a certain Magistery or an Adiaphorous Salt, by which faeculent matter the Capillary Vessels and Membranes become distended, and contracted by its Acrimony, hence in the parts affected arise those Inflammations, and pungent pains, the like Cretaceous substances may if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake not, be observed by a mixture of Spirit of <hi>Niter,</hi> and Oil of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> with the <hi>Serum</hi> of Blood, yet this is not to be supposed to be produced from Alkalies, but by Acids United with them; daily practice illustrates the truth of this. It is very well known Lime Water, Millepedes, Mineral Waters, a Milk diet, and other Medicines of an Alkaline Nature, which infringe Acids, are preser'd: In the Cure of these Diseases, which success cou'd never ensue if their causes were Alkalious, more might be added but these may suffice. Let such Persons who Pride only in a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61347:167"/>
gingle of words, and argue against confirmed Principles, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps rather through the Protection of a Patron, than an awful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Philosophy, and the truth of things, be assured they mount like <hi>Icarus</hi> on Artificial Wings, and may expect an equal ruin.</p>
                  <p>The truth of our Allegation may farther appear from an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment first shown to me by my Learned and Worthy Friend Dr. <hi>Edw. Baynard</hi> of the College of Physicians, <hi>London.</hi> He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Urine of Rheumatick Persons to be distill'd by Mr. <hi>George Molt</hi> Chimist; after distillation scarce one grain of Salt was found remaining, which he had never observed in the distillation of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Urine before, which doubtless must proceed from this cause, that the Saline Particles lodged in the Mass of Blood, were so entangl'd in a Viscous <hi>Lympha,</hi> that the Glandules of the Reins, and Urinary passages were Orifices too small to separate them: The same reason may hold in those labouring under the Dropsy, for their Emission of so small a quantity of Urine.</p>
                  <p>These things premised, proceed we next to give an account of the Pestilential Fever raging in these Counties, the Aetio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of which may be deduced from what proceeds: Sometimes it seized the Patient with an intermittent fit or Two, and then instantly turn'd continued, and in this Class Malignant inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent Fevers may be ranked; sometimes Violent Pleuritick, and Rheumatick pains attend them, the extreme parts, were ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to an uncommon bulk, and many times the Groin swell'd; and which was worthy our Observation these Symptoms receding the Patients grew Delirious, or Comatose, sometimes their Pulse seem'd regular, but oftner weak, quick, unequal, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, with Vibrations, and twitching of the Tendons, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they were opprest with Cold clammy Sweats, Convulsive Motions and an Universal trembling, yet many thus afflicted recover'd, and many sunck away in an irrecoverable <hi>Coma,</hi> others were all distain'd with spots of different Colours, as Red, Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, Purple, and sometimes with Purple Tokens about the Neck, that many times the Patients seem as though they had been strangl'd. I saw Carbuncles upon the spine with all the Ambient
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61347:167"/>
flesh Black and Sphacelated, but indeed these were only in one Person. One there was that was Paralitick but he recover'd; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complain'd of insufferable Head-Aches, as if the very <hi>Crani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> had been opened; they were very restless, and had repeated <hi>Deliriums,</hi> and sometimes it fell out, that even to their Dying hour, many were neither sick in appearance, nor was the Pulse irregular, their Urine well digested, and were sensible all along; many were seized with Violent Haemorrhagies, at the Nostrils, and sometimes the <hi>Uterus;</hi> others complain'd of Nauseousness, and continual Sickness, and Vomiting, the Tongue was spread over with a Yellow Pellicle, with sometimes Black or White Fissures, the Urine often Lixivial, full of Red, White, Black, and Dusky Sediments, many of these Dyed Convulsive, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matose, sometimes the Urine was pellucid, and for many Days deposited a Bricky Sediment, yet having observed remissions in many of these by the use of the <hi>Cortex</hi> desirable success at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                  <p>What the Eminent Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> takes notice of as to this Bricky Sediment, I rather attribute it to a peculiar Bilious Scorbutick Temper of the Blood, than the febrile ferment as he wou'd have it. The Urine sometimes had no Consistence with it, was gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and bore an Oleaginous scum over it, but the Patients void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such were afflicted with very severe Symptoms; many were opprest with cruel Diarrhaeas and Gripes, and others with Costive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, their <hi>Egesta</hi> downwards were of a Blackish green, become so doubtless by very Acrid humours commixt with Bile; by the Learned <hi>Hippocrates</hi> such sort of Excrements were stiled <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that is, <hi>The Bowels bound, and the Excrements black and small, like those of Goats, is Ominous.</hi> The Blood upon the opening of a Vein was generally sizy, and sometimes very florid, with a separation of little or no <hi>Serum,</hi> for that was too much entangl'd with the grumous part of the Blood by Saline Particles to disengage from it; in some the Spittle was thick, and plentiful, sometimes Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61347:168"/>
and sometimes streaked with Blood, and very often so faetid, there was no abiding in the same Room; many of them toured on to forty Days, when being counted Consumptive, and no regard had to the Fever, they expired; their Teeth frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in Twenty four Hours, grew very Black, though White e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough before; and when Dead, purple spots appear'd thick about their Neck and Breasts, which Symptoms to me are undeniable proofs of a Coagulation of the Blood: Besides, can any one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the vast quantity of Viscous Phlegm expectorated, and not conclude from thence the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood to be Coagulated? Or who in the Name of common Sense, that sees the different Coagulations perform'd by different Acids, and the various solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from various Alkalies, will not upon the whole matter Vote these Distempers to arise rather from the first than the second Principle? But this Hypothesis will be the farther illustrated by what follows, Let Blood be taken from the Arm of an Healthful Person, and as it flows into the Porringer, mingle with it some Spirit of <hi>Harts-Horn, Sal Armon.</hi> or <hi>Viganis, Tinctura Antimon.</hi> and in another Porringer mix some of his <hi>SalVolat. Oleos.</hi> impraeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with Salt of Amber, in the first Vessel the Blood remains fluid and florid, in that commixt with <hi>SalVolat. Oleos.</hi> a sizy <hi>Pellicle</hi> covers all the Superficies, as in Blood in inflammatory Distempers; proceeding doubtless from that Acrid Volatile Salt, Coagulating the <hi>Serum,</hi> which by the heat of the Blood endeavouring to fly off, is condensed like Bird-Lime. Note well here, if I mistake not, this <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> clearly Demonstrates to us the causes of these Distempers, and may be of great use in Physick. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Malpighius</hi> and <hi>Borellus,</hi> have observed in that Epidemick Distemper in <hi>Pisa,</hi> that by certain Fermentative Particles, a too great Secretion of Bile happen'd, insomuch, that many Alkali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Particles were thrown out of the Mass of Blood, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which the Distemper did not arise from them as such, but only as they were armed, Porcupine like, with other Morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Particles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:61347:168"/>
In one Porringer let the Blood remain as it comes out; in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mingle either <hi>Hungary</hi> Water, Ticture of <hi>Tartar,</hi> or any Volatile Alkalious Spirit; in the first you will observe all the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies sizy, and in the second the whole to be Florid, it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly appears hence, that the Viscidness of the Blood arises not from Alkalies as they are such, first, because Blood mingled with Alkalies becomes Florid, yet that very Blood mixed with an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaly, armed with an Acid grows sizy; these are the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Symptoms observable in these Distempers; and as to the Therapeutick part I refer it to be deduced from what precedes.</p>

                     <p>IT is reported by the <hi>Germans,</hi> that an Eagle was so Artfully form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a certain Wood, that it took Wing to meet the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Maximilian</hi> upon his road, and appear'd as though alive. The truth of this is not our present enquiry, but an easie Parallel may be produced; any one that reflects on the admirable Virtue and force of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Tree, amidst the Crouds of almost breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Persons languishing in Fevers: Hence it is that so many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifick Wits have been exercised in explicating its qualities, and the doubtful Controversy of the cause of intermittent Distempers, some have placed the seat of the Disease in the Mass of Blood, as the Celebrated <hi>Willis;</hi> others in the Pancreatick juice grown too Austere, as the noted <hi>Sylvius de Le Boe;</hi> others from Salt Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours thrown by the Arteries into the Miliary Glands, as the Learned Dr. <hi>Iones,</hi> others in a certain Poyson oppressing the Elastick force of the Animal Spirits, as the late Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> and others in the Nervous juice Vitiated as the accomplish'd Dr. <hi>Cole:</hi> but to make strict enquiries into these several Opinions wou'd be too tedious a matter, I shall not therefore insist upon them, but passing over these Philosophical disputes, shall assign the cause of all intermittent Fevers, their Seat and <hi>modus;</hi> In the first place, therefore let us suppose all intermittent Fevers to arise from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Particles Coagulating the serous part of the Blood, the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61347:169"/>
truth of this may be thus render'd apparent; as first from the Air, the Season of the Year, or an Errour in the six Non-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, in those places where the Atmosphere abounds with Saline Particles, as in Moist and Marshy parts, there intermittent Fevers Yearly Epidemically rage, as in <hi>Holland,</hi> some Parts of the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> in the Marshes of <hi>Kent, Essex, Lincolnshire, Lancashire,</hi> and other the like Countries, that the Air does abound with such Particles in such places has been before shown, from the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Year it is very clear, as about the Vernal, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal <hi>Aequinox,</hi> at which times of the Year above the rest the Air is filled with Saline Particles, for at these Seasons Saline Efflorescences are more observable, as may be seen on the Lime of Walls, and then it is these Fevers rage most. That they arise from an Errour of living, is very plain from the meaner sort of People, who are more subject to them, and whose Diet is chiefly Salted or sour Meats; to these we may add, that after the fit is ended, the Urine often is highly Lixivial, emitting a Pleasant smell, and depositing a Lateritious Sediment, which is very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar in the Scurvy, in which case it is allowed by all, the Blood abounds with Saline Particles, hence we may take notice the <hi>Cortex</hi> may be of no small use in Scorbutick cases, whose suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess we have Experienced more than once; From what has been said it is plain; intermittent Fevers arise from Saline Particles. Proceed we next to shew the seat of the Distempers, and this may be evinced from the following Heads: <hi>First,</hi> From Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in cases, and again from the Opinions of the Ancients, and their Methods of Cure, and after all, our own conjectures in the matter.</p>
                     <p>As to the Historical part, I will first instance in the case of <hi>Alexander Rigby,</hi> of <hi>Laton</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Esq</abbr> he was seized with a Quartan Ague, that continued upon him some Months, which <hi>Proteus</hi> like, still alter'd its form, many times after theCold trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling fits were pass'd, upon approach of a Hot fit, he became Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptick though of no long continuance, but by a regular method with the <hi>Cortex,</hi> and other alterative Medicines, he perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, and lived many Years afterwards.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:61347:169"/>
The second instance is of Mrs. <hi>Clegg,</hi> Wife to the Reverend Mr. <hi>Clegg,</hi> of <hi>Kirkham</hi> in <hi>Lancashire;</hi> who for a whole Winter, and some part of the Spring, had been afflicted with a Quartan Ague, which at last alter'd into a double Tertian; but alas! In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of those Reciprocal returns usual, Convulsive motions suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to that degree, that for many hours her Limbs were all distorted, an <hi>Aphonia,</hi> or loss of Speech seized her, so that the very Standers by concluded her Dead. Many of these fits she had, and then fell into an Hipocondriac Melancholy, being called into her relief, Apperitive Apozems were prescribed, afterwards the use of Mineral Waters and Chalybeats, withCatharticks in due intervals; by the use of these and the Sulphur Spaw in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> in about a Month her Melancholy vanish'd, but her Aguish fits return'd, which were only weakned by the preceding Method, the <hi>Cortex</hi> with the bitter alterative Decoction, with <hi>Rad. Serpent. Virg.</hi> were directed, which being regularly pursued she recovered.</p>
                     <p>Another case on this Topick I'll produce you, of <hi>Ann Cambell,</hi> Wife of <hi>Thomas Cambell,</hi> at <hi>Stakes</hi> near <hi>Preston</hi> in <hi>Lancashire;</hi> she was seized likewise with a Quartan in <hi>Autumn,</hi> and for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Month her fits were regular enough, but then a very tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic alteration ensued, it seized upon the Nerves, and instead of Aguish fits, she became Speechless, except some inarticulate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Mutterings; her Sense, and Memory were lost, that for the time she knew no one nor remember'd any thing; the day after cruel Spasms disturb'd her, and thus she continued for four or five Months; about three in the Afternoon the fits came on, and after all she labour'd under a severe <hi>Anasarca,</hi> from which and her Quartan, by the use of <hi>Hydragogues, Antiscorbuticks,</hi> and the <hi>Cortex,</hi> she recovered her former Health.</p>
                     <p>From these Historical cases it is evident the <hi>Genus Nervosum</hi> is effected in intermittent Fevers; it now follows, in the next place, to confirm it by the Opinions, and Practice of the Ancients. That our Predecessors in Physick were Inferior to us in Anatomy, is not to be disputed, hence it was they transmitted to us their Sentiments in very Ambiguous expressions; however by Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Theory and Practice together, we find they placed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61347:170"/>
the cause of intermittent Distempers in a certain Spirit, piercing through the Blood and ent'ring even the <hi>Penetralia</hi> of the Nerves. To evince this take <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Thoughts, (our Primitive Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard in Physick) let any one consult his Book <hi>de Flatibus,</hi> where they may find he assigns the cause of intermittent Distempers to certain Malignant Spirits commixt with the Animal Spirits; I will only produce, two instances relating to the thing, the first is this Aphorism <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. On which words <hi>Duretus,</hi> thus Comments, <hi>The Sense of any cold Cause first arises in the Limbs, then coursing through the Back effects the Head, but still occasion'd by an ill Digestion,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; In another Aphorism thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, on which words the same Author thus proceeds, <hi>For a Rigour or Chilliness in the Back, denotes the Seat of the Distemper there;</hi> but repeats the words occasion'd by an ill Digestion, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> said before, it is plain from these Aphorisms and Commentaries, this Cathectick Habit of the Blood affixt to the Nerves, was the cause of intermittent Fevers, in <hi>pag. 130. &amp;</hi> 131. he adds thus, <q>This cause may be given for the Yawnings, and Stretchings, which are common Symptomes in this Distemper, for the Nerves, Tendons, and Ligaments, by concenter'dBlood grow hot, and are contracted, and by the Flatus's force are as it were distorted.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hollerius</hi> in his second Book of Distempers, <hi>pag.</hi> 23. says, <q>It was Customary among the Ancients, and practised by the Moderns, that besides other Medicines directed before the fit, upon its approach to Anoint the Spine, Scapulas's, and Arms, and use the Oil of Chamomel prepared with Wild Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumers, with a Decoction of Rose-Mary in it, and other ingredients agreeable in a Palsy, so those crass Humours which occasion'd the Quartan, and produced the Palsy, were prevented.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Clusius,</hi> translated by <hi>Christopher Acosta,</hi> pag. 326. These may be noted, <q>In Diurnal intermittent Fevers after the Spine is Anointed with <hi>Peruvian Balsome</hi> made warm, half an hour before the fit, let five or six drops of the same, be taken in a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61347:170"/>
little Wine as before directed, it allays all their Symptoms if repeated twice or thrice.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vallesius</hi> in his sixth Section of Epidemick Distempers, <hi>pag.</hi> 219. thus proceeds; To what was before prescribed the <hi>Aegyptian Nitre</hi> may be added, with <hi>Coriander</hi> and <hi>Cummin</hi> Seeds applyed to the Orifice of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> in Barrenness and in intermittent Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to the Loins, and the whole Spine; He alleges the fits arise thence, from all which it is evident, the Opinions of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents were, that all intermittent Fevers arose from a certain Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative matter, impacted upon the Nerves, but knew not how to explain the <hi>Modus</hi> through their Ignorance in Anatomy, which is brought to a Noble perfection in these Days, but that is not not so much to our purpose, it is sufficient for me to shew these were the Sentiments of the Ancients.</p>
                     <p>I cannot therefore see why the noted Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> in his first Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitation of intermittent Fevers, <hi>pag.</hi> 72. thus argues against the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, in these words, <hi>Argumentis quae in Hypothesi nostra generali attu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limus pensitatis, nemo opinor in receptaculis, Visceribus, aut recessibus ad Mentem veterumCollocabit, verum ingremioSpirituum delite scere concedet;</hi> the arguments duely consider'd which we urged in our general Hypothesis, no one, I think, will place their cause either in the common receptacles, the Bowels, or other recesses of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the Ancients wou'd, but solely in the Spirits; since as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly by the instances quoted the Opinions of the Ancients, placed the Causes of intermitting Distempers in the Spirits.</p>
                     <p>Having now made it highly probable that intermittent Fevers arise from Saline Particles Coagulating the serous part of the Blood, it now remains, to shew how it produces these Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and assign the seat of the Distemper: Upon the Coagulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons accruing in the Mass of Blood, the <hi>Lympha</hi> is render'd too Viscid to be separated by its proper Vessels, hence it regurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates back or forces its way through more open Passages, which we may reasonably suppose to be the ConglomerateGlands seated in the <hi>Areolas</hi> of the Stomach, and Bowels, hence by repeated Circulatious thoseSalt Humours are discharged upon the Stomach and Bowels, first, producing but slight Corrugations, or Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61347:171"/>
but afterwards more dismal Agonies; these Saline Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles at last entirely entangled in a <hi>Viscous Mucus,</hi> are still hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd about, and irritate or disturb the Animal Spirits, insomuch, that the whole Body seems to be in a general Convulsion, for now it is the extremities of the Nerves, and the Nervous Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, by consent bring in the <hi>Genus Nervosum,</hi> as first, the <hi>Par Vagum,</hi> then the spinal Marrow, and all the other Nervous ramifications, so that from Head to Foot the whole Animal Oeconomy is disturbed, the Saline Particlesat length encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Bile, from this Emotion it is those heatsarise, those inquietudes and pungent Pains; at length precipitated by the Peristaltick motion of the Bowels, it enters, the Lacteals, and Passes into the mass of Blood, there fresh disturbances arise, as well in the Nervous parts, as the whole Habit of theBody, till it is partly thrown off by Sweat; when I have often observed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Persons, their Sweats to be perfectly of a sour smell, and partly by Urine, which being highly Lixivial deposites a Lateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Sediment by reason of the Bilious Particles too much exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and United with Saline ones; But against this Hypothesis many important Arguments may be objected, I will Enumerate the most Material;</p>
                     <p>First, If the Seat of this Distemper be in the Stomach or Bowels or both, it is not probable the whole Body should so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly be shaken as in this Distemper it generally is,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We find the <hi>Genus Nervosum</hi> effected and very severe Symptoms attending, as Convulsions, Epileptick, and Apoplectick fits;</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, How happens that feebleness, and pain of the Loins, those Yawning and Stretchings, if the Morbifick matter was confined only to the Stomach, and Bowels.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If in intermittent Distempers, the <hi>Lympha</hi> was grown too Viscous; How comes it the whole Body seems to be dissolved in such profuse Sweats,</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, If they arise from Salt Humours, whence comes it that from Salt and Acid things inwardly taken, Agonies and Tremblings do not always immediately ensue.</p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:61347:171"/>
                     <p>To these I will Answer in Order:</p>
                     <p>To the first, although the Morbifick matter be lodged only in the Stomach and Bowels, yet by irritating their Nervous Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes all the Nerves are effected, and consequently the whole Body suffers, the truth of this is render'd apparent by those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances produced by <hi>Wepfer,</hi> particularly that of the Poisonous Aquatick Hem-Lock, where he reports of a Woman, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Eaten of this Root, in the space of half an hour was seized with Convulsions, a stiff bending forwards, and as intensly backwards, and likewise with the Cramp; in which small time it can scarcely be immagin'd it shou'd enter the Mass of Blood, and the <hi>Penetralia</hi> of the Nerves, but after she had taken a Dose of <hi>Theriaca</hi> mixt with Vinegar, the Roots were vomited up entire, her Epilepsy ceased, and she recover'd; others instances he brings like this tryed upon Dogs, and Wolves and Cats, by <hi>Harderus, Hurterus,</hi> and himself, where by the use of <hi>Cocculus Ind. Nux-Vomica</hi> they were seized, with Agonies and Tremblings, in space of half a quarter of an hour, and upon a dissection of them they found the Powders had not pass'd the Stomach, but by irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting its Membranes brought in the whole Order of Nerves, with the spinal Marrow; whence ensued those violent Convulsions, and Spasims, from all which it may be concluded beyond dispute, that the Body may generally suffer, though the Morbifick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be nested only in the Stomach and Bowels: More-over, who is not sensible that the Histerick Epilepsy arises from the Membranes of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> and that cruel Convulsions, Agonies, and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings proceed from the Cholick, whose Seat is doubtless in the Intestines: To these may be added that strong Convulsions arise from the puncture of a Nerve, and sometimes from the <hi>Hernia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomia,</hi> which things consider'd it seems easy to conceive, how Agonies seize the Patient in intermittent Fevers, though the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Bowels are only effected, therefore, I think, my self Excusable to so many Learned Men, though I dissent from their Nervous Hypothesis in this case for these following reasons,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61347:172"/>
First, I cannot think these Salt Humours that are the causes of intermittent Fevers can enter the Substance of the Brain, the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages or Tubes of the Nerves, or Nervous Membranes except Vertigoes, Convulsions, Stupors, or the like Symptomes had preceded the fit, which seldom happens here, Secondly, The Orifices of the Nerves are so small, that they are scarce distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishable by the most improved <hi>Microscopes,</hi> nor can we discern any tumefaction above a Ligature, how then can we Imagine these Salt Crass Humours, can penetrate the <hi>Genus Nervosum,</hi> so as to occasion intermittent Fevers, pardon me if I bring a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison from the sacred Writ, no more than an Elephant can pass the Eye of a Needle.</p>
                     <p>To the Second and Third Objection brought against this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis, the preceding Arguments may suffice; To the Fourth I reply, the Nervous System is doubtless deprived of its due <hi>Pabulum,</hi> by the Viscous <hi>Lympha</hi> entangling the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, hence the Face grows pale, the Strength decays, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite fails, and the Subcutaneous Glandules, deprived of the elastick force of the Spirits which contracted them, now become Flaccid, and open with wider Orifices, insomuch that the serous part of the Blood continually throws off, and the patient dissolves in continual Sweats, for when we affirm the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood to be over Viscid, it is not to be understood of an Universal Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, but that various humours contain'd in the Mass of Blood, are condensed according to the Quality, and Quantity of the Saline Particles, hence the fits ensue at certain distances of times, by the Circulation of the Blood, which granted it is plain enough to conceive how those profuse Sweats come on; To the fifth I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, perhaps by the <hi>Mucus</hi> of the Stomach besmearing its Tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, tho' Salt and Acid Liquors may be immediately received into it, notwithstanding that it is so defended by it that no Agony can instantly arise, or perhaps by the various alterations the Saline Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles undergo in the mass of Blood, they become so Volatilized they produce different effects, the truth of which is plain from the difference betwixt Crude and Fermented juices; These things allow'd, we may readily solve how by one only Dose of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61347:172"/>
the <hi>Cortex,</hi> taken half an hour before the approach of the fit, very often diverts it, and secondly, how by Purges though very gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as even Milk glisters, the Distemper returns, thirdly, how the fits renew within a Month, the <hi>Cortex</hi> not being repeated; and fourthly, this leads us to a solution of other Inflammatory Cases, as the Pleurisy, Apoplexy, Rheumatism, Colick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That a small quantity of the <hi>Cortex</hi> taken half an hour before the fit, may produce these effects, let us suppose, that by the innate heat of the Stomach and Bowels, and by the Humours there lodged, in a Moment almost a Tincture is extracted from the <hi>Cortex,</hi> just as we see in Galls put into Mineral Waters, even in the twinking of an Eye it becomes of a purple Colour, and Precipitates: by a Parallel reason may we allow the <hi>Cortex</hi> to Precipitate the Saline or Austere Particles, hence the Morbifick matter alter'd, the Nervous <hi>Tunicles</hi> are no longer twitched nor Corrugated by their Points; thus many times by one single Dose the fit is diverted: But this could never ensue in so short a time, by only one Dose of the <hi>Cortex,</hi> if the Morbifick matter lodged in the very substance of the Nerves, and that the Particles of the <hi>Cortex</hi> according to the Nervous Hypothesis, were to pass into the very <hi>Genus Nervosum,</hi> whose <hi>Penetralia</hi> are too small for such Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles as we asserted before, some urge indeed that by a puncture of the Nerve many times a <hi>Lympha</hi> distils, but this does not demonstrate that a <hi>Lympha</hi> passes through the Nerves, but rather shows it to be a <hi>Lympha</hi> flowing from Capillaries adhering to the outward <hi>Tunicles</hi> of the Nerves, or it may be a Lymphatick Vessel it self wounded: but against these assertions one strong Argument remains, that if intermittent Distempers arise from Saline Particles lodged in the Stomach and Bowels, thrown of thither by the mass of Blood, how comes it then since the Circulation of the Blood is so swift, that the fits come not once every hour but only at stated times, and hence are called Quotidian, Tertian, and Quartan Agues.</p>
                     <p>To this we say, it is very true the Circulation of the Blood is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often and swiftly performed, and each in dividual Emunctory endeavours its proper Secretions, but the <hi>Lympha</hi> here having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired such a thickness, that it cannot duely enter its proper Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61347:173"/>
is forcid to rush into more open passages <hi>(viz.)</hi> into these Conglomerate Glandules, through which perhaps it can only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the space of Twenty Four Hours, sooner or later, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the quality of the Disease, nay even these Glandules themselves, in a sound and Natural state, separate a Viscous <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> but in very little quantity; and perhaps whilst the Blood per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms its many Circulations, this febrile matter touches upon the the Membranes of the Muscles, and hence it is those Symptoms called <hi>Antesignana,</hi> or Fore-runners, as Yawning, Stretchings, Pains of the Loins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proceed; but after a sufficient Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Acrimonious matter separated by the Conglomerate Glands, then ensues that train of Agonies; it is certainly very wonderful to consider, what horrid Tumults the Particles of the Blood, deprived of a separation by their proper Emunctories, raise in the Body; That Particles of Bile are separated from the mass every Circulation is indisputable, but when the Glandules of the Liver become incapable to do that Office, then they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound into the Blood, and are hurry'd here and there, and rush thorough any Avenue, so that in some I have known periodical Convulsive fits return once in 24 hours; for the truth of which one instance shall suffice; In <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1696. the Honoured <hi>Robert Hesketh,</hi> of <hi>Rufforth,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Esq</abbr> was seized with the Black Jaundice, insomuch, I concluded all the Glands of the Liver to be Obstructed, his Urine was Black, so impregnated was it with Bilious Particles, which at length invading his Brain, thence a Phrensy ensued, and for three Nights together about a certain hour he became Epileptick, from which instance it is clear that Particles deny'd a separation by their proper Emuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, undergo various Circulations before they are separated from the mass of Blood, by the same parity of reason the <hi>Lympha</hi> render'd Viscid, must undergo the same Stages before it can exert it self, and at last being separated by theConglomerate Glandules, by itsAcrid Viscocity it frets the Nerves both of the Stomach and Bowels, and so brings on the fits; some indeed allege if the Morbifick matter was lodged in the Mass of Blood, at the end of the fit the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper wou'd be removed by Sweat, but that's their mistake;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61347:173"/>
for in these Distempers we suppose the mass of Blood to have contracted a Saline temper, so that every day Coagulations are generated, according to their quality sooner, or later; It was very strange to observe what unaccountable Ideas those Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sated, Bilious Particles produced in the fore-mention'd Case; he wou'd sometimes tell me at Noon-Day he saw various sorts of Creatures crawling around him, vast Cities and in them innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Crouds of People Walking, Trees, and many other things. All which put together let us imagine that a daily Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is extracted by the Humours from the <hi>Cortex</hi> as was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by which means the fits are weakened, until its Virtue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spent the Morbifick matter renews, and the Fever returns; hence it is easy to show how Purges revive them, but if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the cause first the effects appear no more: that these Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, <hi>Proteus</hi> like, put on many shapes is evident. I will only add that intermittent Fevers, and other inflammatory Distempers commonly so stiled, may be reduced under the same Class, and differ only in degree, as the Morbifick matter is Qualify'd.</p>
                     <p>From the whole in these cases the <hi>Cortex</hi> has acquired a merit durable as time.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, let us suppose that Natural Ferment composed ofa Volatile Alkaly, an Oily <hi>Succus,</hi> and an Acid, to be alter'd in these Distempers from its Natural Crasis, and converted into a Saline temper, whence flow those infinite distribances, and perplexing Agonies, such a Ferment as this was prepared by me at <hi>Oxford</hi> in <hi>August,</hi> 1684, and inserted in the Philosophical Transactions.</p>
                     <p>To which I refer you, and could not therefore but wonder at a late piece concerning the Ferment of the Stomach relating to the same matter, and the Author not having the Ingenuity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge from whom he had the Notion.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of ANTIQUITIES.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO know what our Ancestors were, cannot be more lively delineated to us, than by the Ruines we discover of those Days; hence it is that by penetrating the Bowels of the Earth, we can trace the Footsteps of our Forefathers, and imprint upon our Minds some Idea's of their Times: The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteness of the <hi>Roman</hi> Eloquence was admirable, and methinks to see the <hi>Vas Lachrymatorium,</hi> as the last Obsequy to a deceased Friend, as we are Men, demonstrates to us what we ought to be, but as we are Christians much more: But, alas! an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Idea of those Days cannot be expected, yet I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to revive the Phoenix from its Ashes, and in order to that give you an Account of some <hi>Roman</hi> Urns, with other remarkable Antiquities, of which these Counties furnish us with no small Variety: The most noted Place for these, is <hi>Ribchester</hi> in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cashire,</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61347:177"/>
by <hi>Antoninus</hi> called <hi>Coccium</hi> from <hi>Coccius Nerva,</hi> or <hi>Goc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium,</hi> and doubtless a Town of large Circumference, as is visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by its Ruines; I have seen there subterraneous Walls, Urns, Coins, <hi>Romish, Danish</hi> and <hi>Saxon,</hi> Anchors, Rings, and Nails of small Vessels or Boats; this Place however is at a great Distance from the Ocean, and to which there is no River Navigable; how therefore the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of those Times came there to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited, may challenge our Enquiry. That this Place was a <hi>Roman</hi> Station seems unquestionable, and maintain'd as a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress to keep that Part of the Country in Awe, and it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable but that here they placed their <hi>Machines;</hi> and hence it is those Relicts are daily discover'd, for in all likelihood, when the <hi>Romans,</hi> commanded <hi>Britain</hi> by Legions, they wou'd never much subdivide or disperse themselves thinly into different Parts, but rather keep embody'd and entire: But to make it clear how these Utensils, and Marine Antiquities came here to be lodged, tho' it certainly was never a Port, being now so far distant from the Sea, take these following Particulars: The First is in a Letter from the Ingenious and Learned Mr. <hi>Oddy,</hi> School-master at <hi>Blackburn.</hi> 
                  <q>When we were at <hi>Ribchester</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and had carefully view'd the Place, you may remember I gave you my Opinion, and Reasons why <hi>Ribchester</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been Navigable so high, and that Doubt raised about the Place called <hi>Anchor-Hill,</hi> may easily be solved; that that Bank was a Rampire of the Fortress is very visible, under which there is yet a broad and deep Foss leading towards the River, serving, as I conceive, for a double use, <hi>viz.</hi> as a Trench to fortifie the Place, and a Canal (like to that up to <hi>Holbourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, London,)</hi> for Boats for the Garrison upon all Occasions, to pass over and repass the River, which is not fordable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts but in dry Weather; and we may reasonably suppose there was a great Number of Boats of all forts belonging to so large a Fort and City, the <hi>Anchor-Hill,</hi> so called, being as it were a little Dock or Hithe, for the Building or Repairing them, and that the Anchors, Rings and Nails there found, were only for then use, and not for Ships, they being far too little either for Ships of Burden or War.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61347:177"/>
We cannot rightly make out what Legion of the <hi>Romans</hi> was planted here, by any of the noble Ruines we disclose; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by what has been discover'd, both the Antiquity and Grandeur of the Place, will be clearly represented, and our modern Observations be no small Supplement to the more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Ones, where Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> and others have saved me the Trouble, I shall fairly name them in order, and in Conclusion add my own. The first Inscription Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> takes Notice of, is at <hi>Salisbury-Hall,</hi> on the Pedestal of a Pillar, which is as follows:
<q>
                     <lb/>Deo
<lb/>Marti ET
<lb/>VICTORIAE
<lb/>DD. AVGG.
<lb/>ET CC—NN.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And in the Wall adjoining to it is another Stone, with the Portraiture of <hi>Cupid,</hi> and another little Image, and in the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of it is this Inscription;
<q>
                     <lb/>SEOSEAM
<lb/>ROLNASON
<lb/>OSALVEDN
<lb/>AL. Q. Q. SAR
<lb/>BREVENM
<lb/>BEDIANIS
<lb/>ANTONI
<lb/>VS MEG: VI.
<lb/>IC. DOMV
<lb/>ELITER.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> supposes to be <hi>British</hi> Names of Places, but I do not see how that can be made out, but rather look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'em to be the Names of Officers in a Wing of the <hi>Sarmatians. AL. Q. Q. SAR</hi> denoting the <hi>Ala Sarmatum,</hi> or a Wing of the <hi>Sarmations,</hi> of which <hi>Tacitus</hi> gives a full Account; <hi>Osalvedn</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61347:178"/>
may probably signifie <hi>Oswalds</hi> Town, the noble Family of the <hi>Osbaldstones</hi> still residing there; so that these Names may not only be <hi>British,</hi> but likewise <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Sarmatian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next Account is of a fair Altar, with this Inscription<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <q>
                     <lb/>DEIS MATRIBVS
<lb/>M. INGENVI—
<lb/>VS A'SIATICVS
<lb/>* DEC. AL. AST.
<lb/>SS. LL. M.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Signification of which, as <hi>Cambden</hi> himself is silent, so I refer it to other Antiquaries to discuss: However, upon my being last at <hi>Oxford,</hi> I receiv'd there the Satisfaction to find, that <hi>Iuno</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> were constantly called by the <hi>Romans Deae Matres.</hi> And the further Explication of this Altar, is that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuis,</hi> an <hi>Asiatic</hi> one of the <hi>Decuriones</hi> of the <hi>Asturian</hi> Wing, dedicated this Altar to the Mother Goddesses, <hi>Iuno</hi> and <hi>Diana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another little Altar he saw cast out amongst the Rubbish, with this Inscription;
<q>
                     <lb/>PACIFE
<lb/>RO MARTI
<lb/>ELEGAVR
<lb/>BA POSV
<lb/>IT EX VO
<lb/>TO</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Altar from its Smallness Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> takes to have been some poor Man's Altar, to carry about with him, and to have been for offering Incense, Salt and Flower. But to me this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation seems more reasonable, from the very Words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at length, that <hi>Elegaurba,</hi> doubtless a Commander there, dedicated this Altar to <hi>Mars</hi> after some signal Overthrow of the Enemy; and thence Peace ensuing, he styles him <hi>Pacifero,</hi> but who this <hi>Elegaurba</hi> was, or what Country Man, I pretend not to determine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61347:178"/>
He speaks also of another Stone dug up, with the Portraiture of a naked Man on Horse-back, without Bridle or Saddle, bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishing his Spear with both Hands, and insulting over a naked Man prostrate, who held out before him a kind of square Piece; between the Horse and the Person prostrate stand the Letters <hi>D.</hi> M. under the prostrate Man are GAL. SARMATA. There were other Letters too defaced to guess at, one would imagine, says he, both from the former Inscription and this that was found many Years agoe, that a Wing of the <hi>Sarmatae</hi> had their Station here.

               <p>This Inscription, as I take it, may be thus translated, <hi>Aael:</hi> a Matron who lived 28 Years, Two Months and Eight Days, in this Earth lies entomb'd; and <hi>Marcus Iulius Maximus</hi> her Son, who lived Six Years, Three Months and Twenty Days; and <hi>Campania Dubba</hi> her Mother, who lived Fifty Years: <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Maximus</hi> and <hi>Alae</hi> a <hi>Sarmatian,</hi> Wife to her incomparable Husband, erects this to perpetuate the Memory of <hi>Simo</hi> the Son of a pious Father, and his Father in Law.</p>
               <p>Now the Word <hi>Asiaticus</hi> in the Inscription beginning with <hi>Deis Matribus,</hi> and in that preceding it beginning with <hi>Seoseam,</hi> and in this last of all, that Word <hi>Sar,</hi> being repeated, it makes it more probable to me, that <hi>Sarmatia</hi> being a Part of <hi>Asia,</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61347:179"/>
likewise Part of <hi>Europe</hi> containing <hi>Poland, Russia, Muscovy,</hi> and most of <hi>Tartary,</hi> from which vast Country the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> being an industrious and trading People, transplanted several Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies hither, and on the Portraiture of the naked Man these Words <hi>Gal. Sarmata</hi> being found too, does farther illustrate these People called <hi>Brigantes</hi> residing here, to be for a great Part <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siatics,</hi> of which Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> takes no Notice.</p>
               <p>Thus far and no farther Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> proceeds in the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of this noted Station; but as to the ancient Name of the Place, he says, <hi>Ptolemy</hi> stiles it <hi>Rigodunum,</hi> and that being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted from <hi>Ribodunum</hi> may not be unlike <hi>Ribbochester.</hi> It is his Opinion likewise, the Town of <hi>Preston,</hi> called so from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, <hi>quasi</hi> Priest Town, sprang from the Ruines of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable City which might be ruined by Wars or Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes.</p>
               <p>I shall now acquaint the Reader with my own Observations, made in this present Year 1699 when I was upon the Place, which gave me a new and different Prospect of Matters above what he has recited: The first remarkable Piece of Antiquity I took Notice of, was a Fortification called <hi>Anchor-Hill,</hi> because Anchors have sometimes been found there under Ground, with Rings and Nails of small Vessels, <hi>Roman Paterae</hi> of a Mettal like that of our <hi>China</hi> Tea-Pots, with the Effigies of Wolves and Flowers upon them, and at the Bottom of some these Letters <hi>Fab. Pro.</hi> which doubtless must be in the Time when some one of the <hi>Fabii</hi> were Pro-Consul or Procurator. From <hi>Anchor-Hill</hi> there goes a Way to <hi>Preston</hi> and a Road to <hi>Lancaster,</hi> where there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fortification, and a <hi>Roman</hi> Wall; another Road likewise directs to <hi>Mancunium,</hi> or <hi>Manchester,</hi> where was a Fortress called the <hi>Giants</hi> or <hi>Torquins Castle,</hi> and doubtless that was their High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to <hi>Devona</hi> or <hi>Chester,</hi> where the Twentieth Legion, stiled <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Victrix,</hi> was fixed; <hi>Chester</hi> was then a Blockade to the <hi>Britains</hi> in <hi>Wales:</hi> Not far from this Fortification, called <hi>Anchor-Hill,</hi> at <hi>Ribchester,</hi> I saw a Common-shoar, and a Floor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of <hi>Roman</hi> Tyles, which absolutely demonstrates the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver there was never Navigable, for had it been so that City
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61347:179"/>
must unavoidably have been under Water, together with in that Country, commonly call'd the <hi>Field,</hi> from its resemblance to a Field being all Champaign. Near this Shoar I saw a Pillar about Seventeen Inches Diameter, with Letters upon it, but those in a great measure erased, and not at all legible. This Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in all probability was erected in Commoration of some remarkable Victory the <hi>Romans</hi> obtained over the <hi>Britains.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Coins I met with there, which are discover'd as the Hill shelves into the River, were one of them <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>'s, the rest <hi>Titus Vespasian, Dioclesian, Coccius Nerva,</hi> from whom 'tis likely the Place by some was called <hi>Coccium, Domitian, Trajan, Adrian, Severus, Commodus, Marcus Antoninus,</hi> and <hi>Iulia,</hi> some in Copper, and some a mixed Mettal, in which last the Letters are very legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; likewise one <hi>Saxon</hi> Coin, and that in Silver; amongst these was likewise found a <hi>Ruby,</hi> with <hi>Mars</hi> on the Reverse, the Genius of the Place, as appears by a <hi>Roman</hi> Altar dug up there, which is now removed to <hi>Dinckley,</hi> a Seat not far remote from thence, and now in the Possession of <hi>Edward Warren,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> who married a <hi>Talbot,</hi> an Heiress of that noble Family; on this Altar these Words are inscrib'd, <hi>Deo Marti &amp; Victoriae:</hi> There is another <hi>Roman</hi> Altar, but on that the Letters are erased, and are not legible. I saw likewise Two Coins found at the same Place with Crosses on the Reverse, and the Head of an Emperor, but the Letters too obscure to be read; however, it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it may be of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, from the Figure of the Cross appearing to him in the Air, with these Words, <hi>Sub hoc Signo Vinces:</hi> At the same Place are frequently found several Pieces of <hi>Roman</hi> Urns, and Flower-Pots, all which consider'd: fully demonstrate the great Antiquity of the Place, and in those Days its Magnificence, which is now but a small Village, tho' it is still honour'd with several Noble Families that are Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to it. But its Greatness in those Days may appear far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Finger of a Copper Statue, which doubtless was erected for one of their Emperors, and found amongst the Ruines. The <hi>Romans</hi> to perpetuate any memorable Overthrow of their Enemies had Three Ways to do it, either by erecting
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61347:180"/>
of Pillars with Inscriptions, or the Statues of the Emperors, or by Triumphal Arches, of which here are the Ruines of the two first: But, tho' all these represent to us the Grandeur of the Place, yet they prove not to us that any <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor ever resided there, but rather that the Station was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Tribunes, Pro-Consuls, and Procurators.</p>
               <p>These following Pieces of Antiquity were communicated to me by Mr. <hi>Oddy,</hi> School-master, at <hi>Blackburn;</hi> and the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Mr. <hi>George Ogden,</hi> Fellow of the Collegiate Church of <hi>Manchester,</hi> and present Vicar of <hi>Ribchester.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides the engraven Altars here mentioned, I saw another when I was last over there with this Inscription,
<q>
                     <lb/>DEO MARTI ET
<lb/>VICTORIAE DEC.
<lb/>ASIATIC. AL. SARMAT.
<lb/>SS L. L. M. I. T. C. C. N. N.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This seems to be an Altar dedicated to <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Victory,</hi> the <hi>Genii</hi> of the Place, by one of the <hi>Decurions,</hi> by Birth an <hi>Asiatic,</hi> commanding in a Wing of the <hi>Sarmatae,</hi> and the fix last Letters may be <hi>Imperatori Triumphanti Caesari Coccio Nervae,</hi> to the Triumphant Emperor <hi>Coccius Nerva;</hi> from whom this Place by <hi>Antoninus</hi> was called <hi>Coccium:</hi> This is truly Antique, and gives us an ample Demonstration of the Truth of what <hi>Antoninus</hi> relates.</p>
               <p>From our Observations upon the Inscription of the Altars found at <hi>Chester,</hi> and <hi>Hulme,</hi> we may readily inform our selves who commanded the Legions or Detatchments from them; the twentieth Legion at <hi>Chester,</hi> stiled doubtless <hi>Valens Victrix,</hi> was commanded by <hi>Longinus Flavius,</hi> a Tribune. That at <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> by the Inscription at <hi>Hulme,</hi> seems to be only a Detatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Sixth Legion residing at <hi>York,</hi> stiled also the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> and commanded here by <hi>Lucius Senecianius. Brutus</hi> was the third Commander in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61347:180"/>
Yet this at <hi>Ribchester</hi> only acquaints us with the Title of the Officer, a <hi>Decurion</hi> commanding the Tenth part of a Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but whether this Detatchment was from <hi>York</hi> or <hi>Chester,</hi> is not apparent by any Account these ancient Ruines afford us.</p>
               <p>However, considering the <hi>Roman</hi> Ways leading to <hi>Ribchester,</hi> both from <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Chester,</hi> we may equally ballance the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and conclude, Parties from both Legions might be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd thither as their Conveniencies stood. These Ways are yet to be seen over the Forest of <hi>Fullwood,</hi> near <hi>Preston,</hi> to <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi> and <hi>Appleby,</hi> &amp;c. others are visible from <hi>Manchester</hi> by strange Ways, towards <hi>Bury,</hi> and so to <hi>Ribchester.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was one very eminent Piece of Antiquity dug up at <hi>Ribchester,</hi> viz. a large Stone, now a Corner-stone in <hi>Salisbury-Hall,</hi> which anciently belonged to the <hi>Talbot</hi>'s; on one side is <hi>Apollo</hi> with his Quiver on his Shoulder, leaning on his <hi>Plectrum</hi> or Harp, with a loose Mantle or <hi>Velamen,</hi> and on the other side Two of his Priests in the same Habit, with an Ox's-Head in their Hands, sacrificing to him the Heads likewise of various Animals lying prostrate at his Feet.</p>
               <p>We may here raise a very probable Conjecture of this Votive Altar, that it was erected in the Time of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s <hi>Caesars</hi> informs us. <hi>Eusebius,</hi> in <hi>Lib. 5. de Prop. Evang.</hi> assures us, that that Emperor going to <hi>Apollo</hi> for an Oracle, received for Answer, <hi>That the Iust Men were the Cause that he cou'd say nothing:</hi> Which Just Men <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Priests interpreted to be <hi>Christians.</hi> Upon which <hi>Dioclesian</hi> began his most inhumane and barbarous Persecution; so cruel it was, that Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> in his Geography, tells us, There was not a Day in the Year, except the First of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> (on which Day they used not to shed Blood) but there were sacrificed Five Thousand Christians at the least; as he makes evident from St. <hi>Ierome</hi>'s Epistles to <hi>Heliodorus</hi> and <hi>Chrosmaticus:</hi> However, this Island in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure escaped the Fury of it, Divine Providence interfering: For <hi>Fuller</hi> in his Church History of <hi>Britain,</hi> informs us, it continued for one Year only.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61347:181"/>
That this Altar was erected here in <hi>Dioclesian</hi>'s Time, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther probable, from the great Number of his Coins frequently found here.</p>
               <p>This is a true Relict of Antiquity, and, perhaps, as valuable as most in the Kingdom: It gives us a clear Idea of the Pagan Superstitions, and their unmerciful Butcheries of the increasing Christians, as likewise of their obstinate Adherence to their Heathen Rites, notwithstanding the convincing Tokens of a Superior Power: Neither the Silence of their <hi>Delphick</hi> Oracle, struck dumb at our Saviour's Nativity, nor the free Confessions of their inferior Pagods, were any Motives to their Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they rather added Fuel to their Rage, and spurr'd them to more intense Persecutions.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Lancaster,</hi> lately in digging up of a Cellar of Mr. <hi>Parting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s, were found several <hi>Roman Disci,</hi> and <hi>Sympuvia,</hi> or Cups used in Sacrifice, and Coins, as some of <hi>Aelius, Adrianus</hi> and <hi>Augustus Caesar;</hi> the Cups have upon their sides the Figures of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Creatures, and <hi>Iulius Flavius</hi> in Letters; on the bottom of one of these appear'd very legibly these Letters, <hi>Regin. I.</hi> which we may easily interpret, a <hi>Discus</hi> used in Sacrifice to <hi>Iuno,</hi> as she was stiled <hi>Regina Caeli.</hi> These and the foregoing Observations, together with the <hi>Roman</hi> Wall there, commonly call'd the <hi>Weary-Wall,</hi> abundantly demonstrate that ancient Town to have been a most eminent <hi>Roman</hi> Station at the least.</p>
               <p>The next Place remarkable for Antiquities is <hi>Coln,</hi> in the same Hundred with <hi>Ribchester,</hi> the Antiquities of which Place were transmitted to me by the Learned Mr. <hi>Hargrave,</hi> Rector of <hi>Brandsburton,</hi> near <hi>Beverly</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> in the following Words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I have often from the Name <hi>Coln</hi> conjectur'd, that the Place was of more ancient Original, than the Tradition current among the Inhabitants made it; and I was the further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in this by the great Number of <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61347:181"/>
have been frequently dug up nigh it, as at <hi>Wheatly-Lane,</hi> which are generally Copper; and those Silver Ones cast up by a Plough, Three or Four Years agoe, nigh <hi>Emmet,</hi> enclosed in a great Silver Cup, some of which I have seen; one of <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianus</hi> was very legible, and another not so: I have seen Parts of others, whose Remains show they were one of the <hi>Antonines.</hi> But that which most confirm'd my Conjecture of this Town's being a <hi>Roman</hi> Station, was a Conversation I was honour'd with the last Summer, by our Reverend Dean of <hi>York,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gale,</hi> who was pleased to shew me a Book written about the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Century, by a nameless Author at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> which is so far as I know of it nothing but an Itinerary, wherein many ancient Names of Towns through the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire are remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, which others have omitted, especially in <hi>Britain:</hi> That Author comes from our <hi>Camolodunium</hi> to <hi>Colunium,</hi> and thence to <hi>Gallunium,</hi> which by the usual Transmutation of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man G.</hi> into our <hi>W.</hi> that Learned Person concludes to be <hi>Wally,</hi> and thence, I think, I may safely, from the Distance of <hi>Coln</hi> from <hi>Almondbury,</hi> and its lying in the Road betwixt that and <hi>Whalley,</hi> conclude that <hi>Coln</hi> was a <hi>Roman</hi> Station. I will only add, <hi>Sir,</hi> that the Book I have mentioned was printed at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> 1670, or thereabouts, and if our Dean's Coppy was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from the <hi>French</hi> King's Library, and (which is strange) that inquisitive Person told me, he could no where meet with an other Copy, this last Thing has induced me to think, that somewhat I have troubled you with in Relation to the Antiquity of the Place, may be new to you. The Respect I bear to the Place of my Birth, has perchance tempted me to determine too peremptorily in favour of it, which I wholly submit to your very judicious Censure; and if what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten so hastily may be any ways serviceable to your Chapter of <hi>Antiquities,</hi> I shall be extreamly proud to have been in the least measure,</q>
               </p>
               <p>Your Humble Servant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61347:182"/>
With all Deference to that Learned Gentleman, it is my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, <hi>Coln</hi> was not a <hi>Roman</hi> Station, and that for these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Reasons: First, Because where the <hi>Roman</hi> Stations were there are usually Fosses, and Fortifications, of which this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gentleman gives no Account; and tho' the Coins found there might induce him to think it so, yet that Instance is not convincing, since they are frequently found in several other Parts, which in probability were never <hi>Roman</hi> Stations, as at <hi>Bury,</hi> and <hi>Standish</hi> in <hi>Lancashire:</hi> Besides, it is frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, that where the <hi>Roman</hi> Stations were, there are usually found <hi>Roman</hi> Altars dedicated to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Place, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terae</hi> and <hi>Fibulae;</hi> it is very likely therefore that where those Coins are found, and not the other Antiquities, they were only buried there by the <hi>Romans</hi> in their Marches, when they quitted their Stations, who rather chose to hide them in the Earth, than let them fall into their Enemies Hands. Secondly, It is probable it was not a <hi>Roman</hi> Station, from the Account that is given of the Boundaries belonging to them; for, as <hi>Siculus Flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> informs us, the Fields that lay near the Colonies were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by several sorts of Bounds; in the Limits there were placed for Marks, sometimes one thing, and sometimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in some a little Statue of <hi>Mercury,</hi> in others a Wine Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, in others a <hi>Spatula,</hi> in others a <hi>Rhombus,</hi> or a Figure in shape like a Lozenge; and in some, according to <hi>Vitalis</hi> and <hi>Arcadius,</hi> a Flaggon or Jarr. Now, none of all these, as ever I heard of, having been dug up at <hi>Coln,</hi> I cannot conclude it a <hi>Roman</hi> Station, but that the Coins found there were lodged by the <hi>Romans</hi> in their <hi>Itineraries;</hi> but, by reason some of these have been found at <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holland</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> that Place, indeed, may have been a <hi>Roman</hi> Station.</p>
               <p>From what has been observ'd, to me it seems more feasible, that the Name <hi>Coln,</hi> is deriv'd from the <hi>Saxon</hi> Word <hi>Culme,</hi> in that Language signifying <hi>Coal,</hi> that Place abounding with that sort of Mines.</p>

That <hi>Manchester</hi> was a Fortress of Note in the <hi>Romans</hi> Days, is apparent, from the large Ruines remaining in a near adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Field, and some Inscriptions that have been found in Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Places: But, that I may do Justice to the Memory of Mr. <hi>Hollingworth,</hi> once Fellow of the Collegiate Church in <hi>Manchester,</hi> I hope I shall not be censur'd in transcribing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript, relating to the Antiquities of this Town, and now reserved in the Library there. He supposes it received its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination from <hi>Maen,</hi> which, as we find from the <hi>Glossaries</hi> of the <hi>British</hi> Tongue, signifies a <hi>Rock</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> because it is seated on a Rock or stony Hill: The <hi>Romans</hi> call'd it <hi>Mancunium,</hi> or <hi>Manucium,</hi> according to the Variety of Copies mentioned by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus</hi> the Emperor, who lived about an Hundred and Twenty Years after <hi>Christ:</hi> The Thorough-fares ascrib'd to him, are from <hi>Eboracum (York)</hi> to <hi>Calacina (Tadcaster;)</hi> then to <hi>Cambodunum,</hi> a Place now ruin'd near <hi>Almondsbury,</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire;</hi> then to <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muncio,</hi> or <hi>Manucio (Manchester;)</hi> thence to <hi>Condato, Congleton</hi> in <hi>Cheshire;</hi> and then from <hi>Coccium (Ribchester)</hi> to <hi>Mancunio,</hi> and so to <hi>Condato.</hi> This Town of <hi>Manchester</hi> was a Station or Fort of the <hi>Romans;</hi> now the Stations of the <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies were the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Plats of our Cities, and principal Towns, before whose Coming the <hi>Britains</hi> had no other Cities or Towns, than Woods fenced with Trenches and Rampiers, which were Places of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, to avoid the Incursion of the Borderers. In <hi>Aldport,</hi> close by the Town, was another Fort, where many <hi>Roman</hi> Coins have been digged up; it was built Four-square, was commonly call'd <hi>Mancastle,</hi> or <hi>Mamcastle,</hi> being built, as may be presumed, by <hi>Vicius Lupus,</hi> Pro-Praetor, and Lieutenant of <hi>Britain,</hi> as <hi>Ulpian</hi> the Civil Lawyer call'd him, who strengthned these Northern Parts with Forts and Castles. From this ancient Fortress the Place was afterwards call'd <hi>Aldport; Ald</hi> for <hi>Out-Post</hi> in <hi>Teutonic,</hi> (from whence, and not from the <hi>French</hi> they anciently have it) was sometimes used for a City, Wall'd Town, or Fenc'd Place.</p>

Near to the Confines of the Parish towards <hi>Prestwich,</hi> there is a Field call'd <hi>Ho-Castle-Field,</hi> and a Lane call'd <hi>Ho-Castle-Lane;</hi> Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> visiting these Parts, saw at the Fort of <hi>Alpark,</hi> upon a long Stone this Inscription,

                  <hi>Edward,</hi> the First King of the West <hi>Saxons,</hi> and afterwards of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> sent into the Kingdom of the <hi>Northumbers</hi> an Army of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> saith <hi>Hoveden,</hi> ordering that they should fortifie the City of <hi>Manchester,</hi> and place valiant Soldiers in it, it being defac'd by the <hi>Danes:</hi> It was a Frontier Town betwixt the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> that inhabited <hi>Cheshire</hi> and <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> and the <hi>Northumbers</hi> inhabiting <hi>Lancashire</hi> and <hi>Yorkshire;</hi> and in their Wars and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Incursions, was sometimes possessed by the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and sometimes the <hi>Northumbers.</hi> Thus far our Author proceeds.</p>
               <p>As to the present State of the Town, it is vastly populous, of great Trade, Riches and Industry, particularly for the Fustian Manufacture, and Printing them, as for those likewise which are call'd <hi>Manchester</hi> Wares; both which are now sent all over the Kingdom, as well as to the <hi>Indies:</hi> It is watered by the Rivers <hi>Erwell</hi> and <hi>Irke.</hi> Little can be added of <hi>Lancaster</hi> for Antiquity, save that it was doubtless a <hi>Roman</hi> Fortress, as appears by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Wall and Road leading to it; it is at this time a very thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Corporation, and an improving Port: Its Eminency chiefly lies in this, that many Branches of the Royal Family have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd Titles deriv'd from it; which for the Dignity of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in general, I will enumerate as briefly as possible. The First that was stiled Lord of the Place in the Beginning of the <hi>Norman</hi> Government, was <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Poictou,</hi> surnamed <hi>Pictarensis,</hi> because
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61347:184"/>
his Wife came out of <hi>Poictou</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> He was succeeded in that Honour by <hi>William,</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Warren,</hi> upon whose Death King <hi>Richard</hi> the First bestow'd it on his Brother <hi>Iohn,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards King of <hi>England;</hi> of whom <hi>Gualter De Hemingford</hi> and <hi>R. Hoveden</hi> gives this Account: That King <hi>Richard</hi> shew'd great Affection to his Brother <hi>Iohn;</hi> for, besides <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in <hi>Normandy,</hi> he bestow'd upon him such great Preferment in <hi>England,</hi> that he was in a manner <hi>Tetrarch</hi> there: For he gave him <hi>Cornwall, Lancaster, Nottingham,</hi> and <hi>Derby,</hi> with the adjacent Country, and many other Things.</p>
               <p>After this, King <hi>Henry.</hi> III. Son of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> promoted his younger Son <hi>Edmund Crouchback</hi> (he having been prevented of the Kingdoms of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Apuleia)</hi> to the Earldom of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> giving it in these Words: <hi>The Honour, Earldom, Castle and Town of</hi> Lancaster, <hi>with the Cow-Pastures,</hi> which at this Day they call <hi>Vaccaries</hi> from thence, <hi>and Forest of</hi> Wiresdale, Lownsdale, New-Castle <hi>under</hi> Lime, <hi>with the Mannor, Forest, and Castle of</hi> Picke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>the Mannor of</hi> Scateby, <hi>the Village of</hi> Gormancester, <hi>and the Rents of the Town of</hi> Huntingdon. <hi>Edmund</hi> had Issue, <hi>Thomas, Henry,</hi> (and <hi>Iohn,</hi> who died unmarried) which <hi>Thomas</hi> was Second Earl of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and was succeeded in that Honour by his Brother <hi>Henry,</hi> whose Son <hi>Henry</hi> was in Parliament created Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> (being the Second Dukedom that was erected in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that of <hi>Cornwall</hi> being the First in the Person of <hi>Edward</hi> the Black Prince) and left Two Daughters, <hi>Maud,</hi> Dutchess of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and <hi>Blanch</hi> married to <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> so call'd because he was born at <hi>Ghent</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> Fourth Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; who thereby coming to the whole Estate, and being now equal to many Kings in Wealth, was created Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> by his Father; he also obtain'd the Royalties from him, and the King then advanced the County of <hi>Lancaster</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Palatinate: By this Rescript, wherein after he had declar'd, the great Service he had done his Country at Home and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; he adds, <q>We have granted from Us and our Heirs, to our Son aforesaid, that he during his Term of Life, shall have within the County of <hi>Lancaster</hi> his Chancery, and his Writs to

At that Time his Titles were, <hi>Iohn,</hi> Son to the King of <hi>England,</hi> Duke of <hi>Aquitaine</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> Earl of <hi>Derby, Lincoln</hi> and <hi>Leicester,</hi> and High Steward of <hi>England.</hi> After this <hi>Henry de Bullingbrook</hi> his Son succeeded in the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> who having deposed <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, obtained the Crown, and conferr'd that Honour upon <hi>Henry</hi> his Son, afterwards King of <hi>England;</hi> and that he might entail it upon him and his Heirs for ever, he had an Act of Parliament made in these Words: <q>We being unwilling that our said Inheritance, or Liberties, by reason of our now assuming the Regal Seat and Diguity, shou'd be any ways chang'd, transferr'd, diminish'd or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd, but that our said Inheritance, with its Liberties and Rights aforesaid, shou'd in the same Manner and Form, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and State, wherein they descended, and fell to us; and also with all and singular Liberties, Franchizes and Priviledges, Commodities and Profits whatsoever, which our Lord and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Life-time had and held it, for term of his Life, by Grant of the late King <hi>Richard,</hi> and wholly and fully continu'd, preserv'd and enjoy'd, by Us and our Heirs, specify'd in the said Charters; and by the Tenure of these presents, we do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our certain Knowledge, and with the Consent of this our present Parliament, grant, declare, decree, and ordain for Us, and our Heirs, that as well our Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> as all and

singular Counties, Mannors, Honours, Castles, Fees, Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Possessions, Annuities, and Seigniories whatsoever, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended to us before the Royal Dignity was obtain'd by us, how, or in what Place soever, by Right of Possession, Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, or in Reversion, or other way remain to Us, and our said Heirs, specify'd in the Charter abovesaid after the said Manner, for ever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And in this State and Condition it remain'd from that time, saving that <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, in the First Year of his Reign, when he had attainted <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth for Treason, appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, as they term it, to the Crown; that is to say, to him and his Heirs, Kings of <hi>England:</hi> However, <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh broke this Entail; and so at this Day it has its peculiar Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, namely, a Chancellor, Attorney, Clerk of the Court, Six Assessors, a Messenger, Two Auditors, Three and Twenty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, and Three Supervisors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chester,</hi> the Metropolis of that County Palatine, is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for the many Antiquities there discover'd, and will furnish us with Variety of Matter, both in relation to its self, and the many celebrated Personages that have receiv'd Titles from it, that it was Eminent in the <hi>Romans</hi> Days is unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, by the numerous Spoils of their Grandeur, and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence found there. I will briefly give you the most noted Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations of Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> upon it, and then add what has been more lately observ'd: That it was a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony, the Tyles daily dug up there confirm to us; on the Reverse of some is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd, <hi>Col. Divana Leg. XX. Victrix.</hi> It is true, indeed, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect to behold the stately Ruines of the Place in this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, which preceding Ages did, yet even in the last Age it was not barren of them, as <hi>Ranulph,</hi> a Monk of this City tells us, in his <hi>Polycronicon:</hi> There are Ways, says he, under Ground wonderfully arch'd with Stone-work, Vaulted Dining-Rooms, huge Stones engraven with the Names of the Ancients; and sometimes Coins dug up with the Names of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> and other famous Men. Likewise <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Chester,</hi> in his <hi>Polycrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con;</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61347:185"/>
When I beheld the Foundations of vast Buildings, up and down in the Streets, it seem'd rather the Effect of <hi>Roman</hi> Strength, and the Work of Giants, than of <hi>British</hi> Industry: As to its Situation, <hi>Lucian</hi> the Monk, who lived Five Hundred Years ago, speaks very largely, both for its Pleasantness and Conveniency; and doubtless it was an Argument of the <hi>Roman</hi> Prudence, here first to form a Camp (for so the Word <hi>Chester</hi> from <hi>Castrum</hi> implies) and then to build a City; for as <hi>Lucian</hi> observes, this Place standing in the West Parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> was very convenient to receive the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, transported hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and besides, it was proper for Watching the Frontiers of the Empire, and was a perfect Key to <hi>Ireland;</hi> its Harbour sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd it with the Products of all <hi>Europe:</hi> For, says the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Ships come in from <hi>Gascoigne, Spain, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> so that we drink Wine very plentifully. Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> takes no Notice of any Antiquities in this City, except some Pavements of Chequer-work; so that our Votive Altars, and Curiosities must be of more modern Discovery: Mr. <hi>Gibson,</hi> indeed, the late Publisher of him with Additions, has an Altar with this Inscription;

               <p>And here the <hi>V</hi> being doubled, he appeals to <hi>Dio,</hi> who says the Twentieth Legion, which is call'd <hi>Valeria</hi> and <hi>Victrix,</hi> is now in upper <hi>Britain,</hi> which <hi>Augustus</hi> preserv'd, together with the other Legion that hath the Name of <hi>Vicesima,</hi> and hath its Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Quarters in Lower <hi>Germany,</hi> and neither now is, nor then was usually and properly call'd <hi>Valeria:</hi> He farther proceeds, that <hi>Valeria</hi> may as well be allow'd, as to other Legions, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Titles of <hi>Ulpia, Flavia, Claudia, Trajana, Antonina,</hi> &amp;c. were. But as to this disputed Title, we shall give the Reader full Satisfaction in what follows:</p>
               <p>Before I take Notice of his other Altar communicated to him by Mr. <hi>Henry Prescot</hi> of <hi>Chester,</hi> let me insert what the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor acquaints us was found round it: About the Foundation where the Altar lay were to be seen the Signs of a Sacrifice, as the Bones, Horns and Heads of several Creatures, as the Ox, Roe-Buck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with these Two Coins,</p>

                        <q>THE Altar found here, is a considerable Piece of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; it does, indeed, prove it self so at first sight, but because the Names of the Emperors and Consuls are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it requires greater Skill in Antiquity, than I pretend to, to fix its <hi>Aera;</hi> however, since you command me, I will give my Conjectures upon that, and other Circumstances of it:</q>

                        <q>In <hi>Iuly</hi> last, 1693. upon Occasion of digging a Place for a Cellar, in the House of Mr. <hi>Heath,</hi> in the <hi>East-Gate,</hi> about Two Foot deep, it was found with the Inscription downward, upon a Stone Two Foot square, and One in thickness, which is supposed to have been the Pedestal, being mouldred off on three sides; the Foundation lay deep and broad, consisting of many great Stones; the Earth about was solid, but of several Colours, and Ashes were frequently found.

               <p>It is plain then in Fact, that the Altar was erected by <hi>Flavius Longinus,</hi> Tribune of the Twentieth Legion, named <hi>Victrix</hi> and <hi>Valens;</hi> and <hi>Longinus</hi> his Son descended from the <hi>House (City</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) of <hi>Samosate,</hi> in Performance of their Vow made for the Prosperity of the then Emperors, to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Place: Yet in order to discover the Manner of that Performance, who the Tribune, or <hi>Augusti,</hi> or Emperors were, the <hi>Aera</hi> of their Reign, and the Year of our Lord (all which are very doubtful) I offer these Observations. <hi>(Genio Loci)</hi> In the <hi>Roman</hi> Heathen Theology, the very <hi>Genii</hi> are almost innumerable, one being deputed to every Person, Place, and almost every Thing useful in their Families, and for their Occasions: They are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently understood to preside over Generations, Nativities, and after that, to be Tutelary to the Person all his Life long: Hence it is, that the Effigies of the <hi>Genius</hi> is commonly Juvenile, crown'd with Plantane-Leaves; and Flowers, Wine, Nard and Honey are offer'd to him in Sacrifice, on Nativities; and the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61347:187"/>
Reason is, because the Birth-day, whereon the Person first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd that chearful Gift, the Light of the Day, shou'd not be defiled or profan'd with Blood, or the Depriving another Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that Light.

From so great and illustrious an House, many Families, no doubt, were propagated, and considering into what Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that House fell with the Imperial Family, upon the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Murther, it is reasonable to think they wou'd rather propagate and flourish in <hi>Syria,</hi> than at <hi>Rome</hi> be obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Envy and Revenge of the <hi>Iulian</hi> Family.</p>
               <p>This Supposition granted, the Number of 346 Years <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Space betwixt the Time that <hi>Cassius</hi> fixed in <hi>Syria,</hi> viz. <hi>Anno</hi> U.

Had it been a <hi>Municipium</hi> or Hans-Town using its own private Laws and Customs, or had it been a City in the Time of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> or before <hi>Septimius Geta,</hi> it's likely some History had mentioned it, and also that it would not have been made a Colony by <hi>Septimius Geta:</hi>

               <p>That Coin is a most valuable Piece of Antiquity, and to be preferred before all our Charters; it founds us a Colony from <hi>Rome,</hi> and proves (what we so much seek after) our Relation to that Legion: That <hi>Chester</hi> was called <hi>Deva,</hi> is also proved by the Itinerary ascribed to the Emperor <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> wherein it is thus inserted,

               <p>This is an Evidence so current and natural to the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, that it must be admitted by the most rigid Antiquary; it is manifest then from History that <hi>Constantius,</hi> when only <hi>Caesar,</hi> was sent over into <hi>Britain</hi> by the Emperors <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Maximinian,</hi> with a great Force against <hi>Allectus,</hi> (which <hi>Allectus,</hi> after he had slain <hi>Carausius,</hi> assumed the Empire to himself, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Year of Christ 293, and about the Ninth Year of the said Emperors,) that he was successful in his Expedition against <hi>Allectus,</hi> and reduced the Island to Peace, and under the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Emperors.</p>

I will be as brief as possible in the Account, and must here acknowledge my self indebted to the ingenious Author of the <hi>Vale Royal,</hi> whose Credit is authentick with the Curious and Learned. As to the Names of the <hi>Britains</hi> inhabiting this County in the Times of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they were called <hi>Devani, Cornavii,</hi> and <hi>Cangi;</hi> of the <hi>Cornavii, Ptolomy</hi> gives the following Account, in the Second Book of his Geography, <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <gap reason="foreign">

They were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced first of all in <hi>Gallia Belgica,</hi> now Lower <hi>Germany,</hi> and from thence by the Command of the Emperor <hi>Claudius</hi> transported into <hi>Britain</hi> under the Command of <hi>Aulus Plautius,</hi> in the Year of Christ 43, whom the Emperor himself follow'd the very same Year, as the same Author testifies, which he confirms by the famous Ecclipse that happen'd therein on <hi>Claudius</hi>'s Birth-Day (the Sun being darken'd about Five Digits) the First of <hi>August,</hi> in the Sixth Degree of <hi>Leo:</hi> But at what Time to fix this Legion in these Parts, is something difficult to determine; yet we may reasonably conjecture it to have been in that Year when <hi>Caesonius Paetus,</hi> and <hi>Petronius Turmilianus</hi> were Consuls under the Reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> and in the Year of Christ 61, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Coins of <hi>Nero</hi> which are frequently found at <hi>Chester;</hi> and that that likewise was the Time when <hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi> attempted the Conquest of <hi>Anglesey:</hi> But this may admit of a

farther probability from the Scheme of Thirty Three Legions of the Empire (then in being) Eight Years afterwards drawn up by <hi>Galba</hi> their Emperor; in which, as <hi>Onuphrius</hi> relates it, he places the Twentieth Legion in <hi>Britain,</hi> stiled <hi>Valeria Victrix,</hi> which Error is before answer'd, and will farther appear so from <hi>Tacitus, Ptolomy,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Tyles dug up at <hi>Chester.</hi> They continu'd in this Station when <hi>Marcus Aurelius Alexander</hi> was Emperor in the Year of Christ 223; and also when <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great had newly built <hi>Constantinople,</hi> this Legion remain'd in its old Station till the Year of Christ 330, and probably was transported out of <hi>Britain</hi> by <hi>Constantine,</hi> he laying great Stress upon his Country-men: Frequent Musters were made of the <hi>British</hi> Youth, and powerful Levies transported for the Service of the Empire. <hi>Richard Broughton</hi> assures us in his Ecclesiastical History publish'd at <hi>Doway,</hi> out of a <hi>Iewish</hi> Author, that so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s Reign, Twenty Thousand <hi>Britains</hi> were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated hence for <hi>Palestine,</hi> and were at the Sacking of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> There were standing <hi>Alae</hi> of them both in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe;</hi> but towards the Declension of the Empire, when so many nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Provinces revolted, especially in <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Third's Reign, about the Time of <hi>Aetius</hi> his Second Consulship, he being then President of <hi>Gallia,</hi> all the <hi>British</hi> Forces then in Arms were carry'd away, and the whole Island left enervate, disarm'd, undisciplin'd, and not one <hi>Roman</hi> Legion to assist them, but the Inhabitants all lay exposed to the Insults of their more potent Invaders.</p>

Some say, he was murthered, and buried at <hi>Clent</hi> in <hi>Staffordshire. Ceoluph</hi> was expelled his Kingdom by <hi>Bernulf,</hi> who was an Usurper, and began his Reign, <hi>An.</hi> Eight Hundred and Twenty Two; he was slain in the Fourth Year of his Reign by the East <hi>Angles: Ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> his Kinsman began his Reign in 826, and he likewise was slain in Battle by the East <hi>Angles.</hi>

                  <hi>Whitnaff</hi> of the <hi>Mercian</hi> Blood Royal was chosen King, before he understood Martial Discipline; he was overthrown in a Battle by <hi>Egbert</hi>'s Captains, and absconded in a Monastery, as <hi>Huntington</hi> testifies; he died in Eight Hundred and Forty, and was buried at <hi>Repton</hi> in <hi>Derbyshire. Bertulph,</hi> Brother of <hi>Whitnaff,</hi> by Permission of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Monarch, obtained the <hi>Mercian</hi> Kingdom, <hi>An.</hi> Eight Hundred and Forty Eight.

whose Age, the <hi>Danes</hi> came into the Mouth of the <hi>Thames</hi> with Three Hundred and Fifty Nine Ships, with whom <hi>Bertulph</hi> had an unhappy Engagement, as <hi>Hoveden</hi> testifies; he died in Eight Hundred and Fifty Three: In that Year <hi>Burthred</hi> ascended the <hi>Mercian</hi> Throne, and was assaulted by the <hi>Danes:</hi> This King died at <hi>Rome,</hi> and was buried in the Church of the <hi>English</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there, dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Derbyshire</hi> (especially the <hi>Peak,</hi> which in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Language fignifies <hi>Eminence,</hi> part of the famous <hi>Mercian</hi> Kingdom, whose Inhabitants were call'd <hi>Coritani)</hi> will afford us but a slender Scene of Antiquities; the very Nature of the Place rendring it inhospitable to Mankind, and at the same time indulgent to Wolves, and Beasts of Prey; yet withal, we may with Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration contemplate the Conduct of wife, and provident Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where amidst all this unpolish'd Rubbish of the Globe, she her self sits in State, and displays her Works equally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with the most desirable Objects: Those uneven Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains she has made pregnant with a very useful and necessary Mettal, and as useful Minerals; she has here and there scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd her Disports for the Diversion of the Curious, and cut out large Themes for Philosophical Enquiries; she liberally affords Hot and Mineral Waters, for the Relief and Comfort of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and decrepid Mortals; so that these untractable and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopl'd Parts become frequented with numerous Crouds, who yearly arrive here, either through a Prospect of Ease from their Pains and Infirmities, or for the pleasing Entertainment of the Mind with new Objects, of which these Parts are very prolifick. I will as briefly as I can give you my Thoughts of what is most remarkable. I have not heard of any <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities save that Place, call'd Little <hi>Chester,</hi> mention'd by Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> where Coins of several sorts, and different Mettals are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dug up, some of Copper, Silver and Gold; and an Altar mention'd by Mr. <hi>Gibson</hi> dug up near <hi>Bakewell,</hi> in the Grounds belonging to <hi>Haddon</hi> - House, the present Seat
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61347:196"/>
of the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,

                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Tooth, Skull and Bones, found in digging a Grove, mention'd by Mr. <hi>Gibson,</hi> I have spoke of such Forms before, and take them to be only the <hi>Lusus Naturae,</hi> in Sparr and other indurated Bodies, which unquestionably at the first were all fluid, and capable of any Impression: We have such a Tooth, though scarce so ponderous, in <hi>Manchester,</hi> yet it weighs Two Pounds and a Half, having been found in <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> with a Skull, and Limbs resembling those of a Man, reported to have been found with it, though those are long since lost; the Tooth it self is a Surprize to many Beholders, who after their superficial Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, conclude it absolute Bone, and stand amaz'd at its Bulk and Weight; when, in truth, it is only a Sparry Substance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest with such a Form: For, do we not daily discover the Forms of Plants, and the seeming Beaks of Birds, Effigies of the Bones of Beasts and Fishes, all of solid Stones? Why Nature therefore shou'd be tied up only to these, and not in her Sports and Interludes divert her self, and Mankind with Humane Shapes, I can see no Reason for.</p>
                  <p>I shall now first begin with the Baths at <hi>Buxton,</hi> but having sufficiently treated in a preceding Chapter of Hot Baths in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the Cause of their Heat, and their Uses, I'll refer the Reader thereto, and here first give you the Distick of Verses made by <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> who honour'd this Place with her Presence, as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> has them:

                  </p>
                  <p>That these Baths were eminent in the Times of the <hi>Romans</hi> is most certain; <hi>Lucan</hi> and others acquaint us, they were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary hot; the high Road, called the <hi>Roman</hi> Bath-gate, as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> says, further confirms it, but it is especially evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from a <hi>Roman</hi> Wall cemented with red <hi>Roman</hi> Plaister, close by St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s Well, where we may see the Ruines of the ancient Bath, its Dimensions and Length. This Plaister is red and hard as Brick, a Mixture not prepared in these Days; and indeed, the white Plaister the <hi>Romans</hi> used was much firmer and harder than any made in these Times, being harder than the Stone it self; the red Plaister appears as if it was burnt, exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling Tyle, but I rather am inclined to think it was a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Lime and powder'd Tiles cemented with Blood and Eggs, which acquir'd that Hardness: Nor is it unlikely, but the white Plaister was effected by some such Method, only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Tyle they might use Chalk.</p>
                  <p>I shall briefly now take a short Survey of the Wonders of the <hi>Peak,</hi> tho' I confess, they do not directly fall within the Heads of this Chapter, however, being so universally remarkable, I cannot well omit them. <hi>Pool</hi>'s Hole within a Quarter of a Mile of the Well, may be thus described; it enters in at the Foot of a large Mountain with a small Arch so low, that for several Paces you are compell'd to creep upon all Fours, but it then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to a considerable Height, not unlike the Roof of some large Cathedral; on the Right-hand stands an Hollow, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Pool</hi>'s Chamber, where by striking with a Stone
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61347:197"/>
upon the Walla noisie Eccho rebounds: From hence you march forward over Ridges of Stones and Rocks, conducted with a Guide and a Candle, and in that rough unequal Passage we receiv'd the Diversion of beholding various Representations produced by the petrifying Water continually dropping from the Roof and Sides of the Rock. Here indeed, we must use more Caution than the Star-gazing Philosopher, who being taken up with a profound Contemplation of the Heavens, was surprized by a Stumble into a Ditch. Here you may see the Representation of most curious Fret-work, Organ and Choir-work; in other Places the Figures of Animals, as the Body of a Man, a Lion, and many other Things which a pregnant Fancy may suggest; here is one Thing called a Font, by others Esquire <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Hay-Cocks, a Chair and Flitches of Bacon, with many more Varieties. Now you arrive at the Queen of <hi>Scot</hi>'s Pillar, clear and bright as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labaster, beyond which is a steep Ascent near a Quarter of a Mile high, which Terminates near the Roof in an Hollow, call'd the <hi>Needle's-Eye,</hi> in which a Candle represents a Star in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament: The whole Prospect, indeed, in this remarkable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity is augmented by the Light of Candles. Near the Pillar we fired a Pistol, which redoubl'd like the Noise of a Cannon. You return the lower Way, where there are many small Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of Water: These are what I observ'd remarkable here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elden-</hi>Hole is a terrible Chasme, it was plumm'd Eight Hundred Fathom by the Ingenious <hi>Charles Cotton,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Esq</abbr> but no Bottom found; if a Stone be cast in you hear its Sound a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable time; it is about Seven Yards in breadth, and double that in length, and very astonishing to look into. That call'd the <hi>Devil's-Arse</hi> is a large and most graceful Arch, from whose Top continually drops a Sparry Water, which like that in <hi>Poole</hi>'s-Hole, petrifies; within the Arch are several small Buildings, where the poorer sort of People inhabit; and I cou'd not but fancy them to be like the <hi>Troglydites,</hi> or <hi>Cunicular</hi> Men, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd by Dr. <hi>Brown,</hi> that liv'd not like Men but Rabbits.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61347:198"/>
From this Arch I passed to a Water which almost closed with the Rock, however this Water may be pass'd, and then the Arch opens again, when you come to very large Banks of Sand; at the third Water the Rock closes, and is impassable any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Mam-Tor</hi> is another Thing remarkable in the <hi>Peak,</hi> this is an high Hill near <hi>Castleton,</hi> under which there are several Lead Mines; this Hill is almost perpetually shivering down Earth, and great Stones, yet never visibly grows less, and has thus continu'd for several Generations; indeed, the Hill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a great way in breadth, so that altho' it constantly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes, it is not discernable by the Eye.</p>
                  <p>The next Thing to be noted is <hi>Tide's-Well,</hi> that ebbs and flows, but that being accounted for in another Chapter, I shall not recapitulate here.</p>
                  <p>Having now given an Account of the Natural Wonders of the <hi>Peak,</hi> I shall proceed next to the Artificial ones which occur, and are not less surprizing.</p>
                  <p>What I have observ'd before in the foregoing Rarities, are the rough Draughts of Nature; yet being nearly view'd, they are of so admirable a Texture, and manag'd with so unerring a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that they justly challenge the Skill of the most daring Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist. In what follows, Art sits Triumphant, and bids fair for a Corrivalship with Nature. <hi>Chatsworth,</hi> like a Sun in an hazy Air, adds Lustre to those Dusky Mountains, and attracts a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Congress to be Spectators of its Wonders: It is the Seat of His Grace, <hi>William,</hi> Duke of <hi>Devonshire;</hi> the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to it is of an easie Ascent; the Gate it self is very remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, adorn'd with several Trophies; the Hill composes a stately Square, from which through a Gallery upon Stone-Stairs, so artfully contriv'd, that they seem to hang in the Air, you have the Prospect of a most beautiful Chappel, as likewise of the Hall, in both which are choice and curious Paintings, perform'd by Seignior <hi>Vario,</hi> Master of that Art; in the Hall is the History of <hi>Caesar,</hi> stabb'd in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61347:198"/>
and in the Chappel an admirable and lively Draught of the Resurrection: Hence we were conducted into the Chambers, which are Noble and Great, and most richly Inlaid, with the choicest Woods, and Compose a very stately Gallery. At the upper End of it is his Grace's Closet, richly beautify'd with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Paint, where there are various Figures of Birds, as Drawn by the Native <hi>Indians:</hi> Here stands a stately Looking-Glass, which, when you approach it, reflects the whole Gallery back again, and so deceives the Sight, that the Walk seems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the Eye, though you have reach'd the Bounds of the Gallery. The next Curiosity were the Gardens, very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, pleasant and stately, adorn'd with exquisite Water, Works; the First we observe is <hi>Neptune</hi> with his Sea-Nymphs from whence, by the turning of a Cock, immediately issue forth several Columns of Water, which seem'd to fall upon Sea-Weeds: Not far from this is another Pond, where Sea-Horses continually rowl; and near to this stands a Tree, composed of Copper, which exactly resembles a Willow; by the turning of a Cock each Leaf distils continually Drops of Water, and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly represents a Shower of Rain: From this we pass'd by a Grove of Cypress, upon an Ascent, and came to a Cascade, at the Top of which stand Two Sea-Nymphs, with each a Jarr under the Arm; the Water falling thence upon the Cascade, whilst they seem to squeeze the Vessels, produces a loud rumbling Noise, like what we may imagine of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> or <hi>Indian Cataracts:</hi> At the Bottom of the Cascade there is another Pond, in which is an Artificial Rose, by turning of a Cock the Water ascends through it, and hangs suspended in the Air in the Figure of that Flower: There is another Pond, wherein is <hi>Mercury</hi> pointing at the Gods and throwing up Water; besides, there are several Statues of Gladiators, with the Muscles of the Body very lively display'd in their different Postures: The Pile is not yet finish'd, but will assuredly be a very compleat and magnificent Structure, and worthy of so illustrious a Family.</p>

                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:61347:199"/>
                     <hi>Haddon-</hi>House is a stately Building, with noble Gardens, the Seat of the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> and worthy the Sight of the Curious.</p>
                  <p>I shall now in the next place proceed to give an Account of the Earls of <hi>Derby;</hi> the First of whom were the <hi>Peverels,</hi> Earls of <hi>Nottingham</hi> and <hi>Derby,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> transmits it to us from good Authorities: Afterwards King <hi>Richard</hi> the First gave and confirm'd to his Brother <hi>Iohn</hi> the County and Castle of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham, Lancaster, Derby,</hi> &amp;c. with the Honours belonging to them, and the Honours of <hi>Peverel:</hi> After him those of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Ferrars</hi> are allow'd to be Earls, whom King <hi>Iohn</hi> created Earls of <hi>Derby</hi> with his own Hands, but his Two Sons <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> in the Civil Wars were stripp'd of this Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and many Possessions of <hi>Robert</hi> were given by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third to his younger Son <hi>Edmund;</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the Third by Act of Parliament gave <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> the Son of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> the Earldom of <hi>Derby,</hi> to him and his Heirs, and likewise assign'd him a Thousand Marks yearly, during the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> his Father: From that Time this Title continu'd in the Family of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> till King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh bestow'd it upon <hi>Thomas Stanley,</hi> who had not long before marry'd <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> the King's Mother; afterwards <hi>William</hi> the Sixth, Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> of this Family, a Man of great Worth and Honour, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd it, when the Author Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> writ this; <hi>William</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting this Life, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1642. was succeeded by <hi>Iames</hi> his Son and Heir, Eminent for his good Services to King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, as was also his Excellent Lady <hi>Charlote,</hi> who with a true Masculine Bravery sustain'd the Siege of <hi>Latham-</hi>House against the Parliament's Forces, when my Grandfather Colonel <hi>Chisnell</hi> Commanded under her: He receiv'd Two Commissions, One from His Majesty King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, for a Regiment of Horse, the Other from his Highness Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Foot; in which are these Expressions: <q>For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the True Protestant Religion, by Law establish'd, the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61347:199"/>
Liberty and Property of the Subject, and Defence of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Person; which is an invincible Argument of the Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy of the contrary Party, who wou'd calumniate these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Patriots, with being Abettors of Popery and Arbitrary Power.</q> The worthy Earl after the Fight of <hi>Worcester,</hi> being unfortunately taken in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> was on the Fifteenth of <hi>October</hi> Beheaded at <hi>Bolton</hi> in <hi>Lancashire:</hi> He was succeeded by his Son <hi>Charles,</hi> and he by his Eldest Son and Heir <hi>William,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Earl; he had Issue <hi>Iames,</hi> Lord <hi>Strange,</hi> by <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter of the late Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and Daughter to the late Earl of <hi>Ossory:</hi> This young Gentleman in the ripening Bloom of his Years, had all the Marks of a sweet Temper, real Honour, and solid Judgment, that in those Years cou'd possibly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; but to the unspeakable Loss of his Parents, and the universal Sorrow of the whole Country, he unfortunately died the last Year at <hi>Venice</hi> of the small Pox, in the Course of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels: The present Earl has now Two Brothers, (but no issue Male) Persons of great affability, true Conduct and Bravery, as the World is sufficiently convinced of by their repeated Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Flanders,</hi> in the Service of his present Majesty, King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the Third.</p>
                  <p>Having thus far proceeded in the Antiquities of these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which unquestionably add to the Glory of them, in laying before us the Regard the <hi>Romans</hi> had by erecting their Colonies, and forming their Stations for the Security of these Parts of <hi>Britain;</hi> it remains now for the Satisfaction of the Reader, that I give him an Explanation of the Reverses of the Coins dug up in different Places here. I pretend not hereby to add many to the numerous Catalogues collected and explained by the Care of preceding Antiquaries; but that I may give what is due to these Parts of our Isle, esteemed, indeed, obscure and barren by many, one may by these Reverses form some Idaea's of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and their wondrous Transactions carried on in those Times. One thing is observable here, that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61347:200"/>
as it was an universal Custom in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>China</hi> to deliver their Sentiments by Hieroglyphical Representations, so in those Days the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors were no less devoted to that Piece of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. I shall not observe any strict Method in the Successions of the Emperors, but give you the Coins indifferently as they came to my Hands.</p>
                  <p>On the Reverse of one of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s Coins was <hi>Mars</hi> with a Spear, or <hi>Scutum,</hi> or Target, which doubtless denoted his Warlike Temper.</p>
                  <p>On one of <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>'s was <hi>Pallas</hi> with these following Letters, DESID. P. R. thus interpreted, <hi>the Desire of the</hi> Roman <hi>People;</hi> which sufficiently evidences to us the great Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given to Learning in those Days, at which Time it was, those great Masters of Eloquence and Poetry flourished, <hi>viz. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero, Virgil, Horace,</hi> &amp;c. Others of his have a Peacock on the Reverse; that doubtless denotes his <hi>Apotheosis,</hi> or being dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; that being a Bird sacred to <hi>Iuno,</hi> who in those Days was stiled the Mother Goddess, or the Goddess of Heaven: It must needs be amazing to consider, that such strange Impieties and unaccountable Ignorance, and yet such exalted Learning, should then abound.</p>
                  <p>I have seen others of the same Emperor which bore <hi>Ceres</hi> with a <hi>Cornucopia</hi> in one Hand, and a Flower-pot in another, which in that Reign denoted Pleasure and Plenty.</p>
                  <p>The same I have seen upon <hi>Adrian</hi>'s and <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Coins, wherefore I shall not need to expatiate further upon those.</p>
                  <p>Only some of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s have <hi>Augustus Germanicus,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes his Conquests in <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Titus Vespasianus</hi> has on the Reverse an Altar with a <hi>Cotyla,</hi> which must likewise signifie either his Sacrificing to the Gods, or that Divine Worship was paid to himself.</p>
                  <p>Those coin'd by the City of <hi>Rome</hi> have usually Two Infants sucking a Wolf, which allude to the Story of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> of which <hi>Florus</hi> gives a Relation, to whom I refer you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:61347:200"/>
Upon <hi>Helena</hi>'s, the Mother of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, I have seen <hi>Mars</hi> with a Spear in his Right-hand, holding the Left upon the Head of a Monkey, which seem to hint to us the Extent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in those Days, that Creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Product of <hi>Asia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are frequently found <hi>Victoria</hi> winged, and in one Hand holding a <hi>Victoriola</hi> winged, which seem to point out to us their unlimited Conquests.</p>
                  <p>I have on some observed <hi>Proserpina</hi> sitting in a Chair feeding Snakes, which probably may allude to an Universal Quietness and Plenty, she and <hi>Ceres</hi> being the supposed Goddesses of the Vallies, making all Things fruitful.</p>
                  <p>I have seen upon a Coin <hi>Sibilla Belgica,</hi> and upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse a Man with a Spear and a Trophy upon his Shoulder, who this should be, I cannot make out from any Author.</p>
                  <p>There are several others of <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> and <hi>Geta</hi> his Son, that have on the Reverse <hi>Iuventus,</hi> which denotes the flourishing State and blooming Greatness of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
                  <p>Some have a Man with a Torch in his Left-hand, signifying, either a Sacrificing to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Place or to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</p>
                  <p>Upon others are <hi>Neptune</hi>'s with a Trident in one Hand, and a Dolphin in the other, which may represent their Conquests by Sea, and probably upon this Island.</p>
                  <p>On some an Eagle and the Word <hi>Consecratio,</hi> which intimates the Emperor's being deified, or his ascending to Heaven; that being a Bird sacred to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and as it has been affirm'd, one that only proves its Legitimacy, by not being dazled with the Beams of the Sun, whence came that Metaphor in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which implies <hi>Sincerity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many times we meet with <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Priests with <hi>Simpuvia</hi>'s or Sacrificing-Cups in their Hands together with the <hi>Securis</hi> and <hi>Dolabrum,</hi> which are all Instruments that denote Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:61347:201"/>
Some have on the Reverse Justice with a Sword and Bilanx, which represent Authority.</p>
                  <p>There are of <hi>Geta</hi>'s that have a Cupid in the Right-Hand, and a Cupid and a Laurel in the Left, which may represent his Juvenileness and Martial Temper, being, when but a Youth, put into great Commands by his Father <hi>Severus,</hi> who obtained many Victories over the <hi>Britains:</hi> Afterwards the said <hi>Geta</hi> was slain by his Brother <hi>Caracalla</hi> in the Arms of his Mother, as <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> testifies.</p>
                  <p>Others bear a Palm with these Words, PAX AB TE, these hint to us, that Peace usually succeeds Victory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> has some with <hi>Britania</hi> on the Reverse hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Cornucopia,</hi> which manifest to us the Plenty in <hi>Britain</hi> in those Times.</p>
                  <p>Upon some he stiles himself <hi>Britannicus,</hi> denoting his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Severus</hi> has on the Reverse Two <hi>Cornucopia</hi>'s, evidencing the Abundance of Plenty in the Empire in his Reign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Severus Alexander</hi> has on the Reverse one of the <hi>Popae</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gones</hi> holding a Palm, which probably may signifie, that by their Prayers to the Gods the Emperor became Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>Others have the <hi>Flaminii</hi> with Torches in their Hands, which was another Order of their Priests that assisted at Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
                  <p>Some have a Woman with a Crow in her Hand, which may relate to Sacrifice, that being a Bird taken notice of by their <hi>Augures</hi> and <hi>Aurispices</hi> in their Predictions.</p>
                  <p>Some are adorned with the <hi>Tubicines,</hi> which was another Order of their Priests sounding their Trumpets during the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
                  <p>I have some with the <hi>Flaminii</hi> sacrificing Two Pigeons to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and the <hi>Genii</hi> of the Place.</p>
                  <p>Others have the <hi>Sagittarii,</hi> another Order of their Priests.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:61347:201"/>
Others have <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Annona,</hi> arguing Plenty and an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Amnesty and Charity.</p>
                  <p>Some with a <hi>Tripos</hi> and <hi>Caduceus,</hi> denoting Peace.</p>
                  <p>Upon some may be observed <hi>Ceres</hi> holding a Spike of Corn in the Left-hand, and a Torch in the Right, intimating, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that for reaping Harvest a Sacrifice ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to her: Some of <hi>Faustulus</hi>'s Coins are of this Kind.</p>
                  <p>Upon some are stamped a Star with a Crown and <hi>Fasces,</hi> which seems to allude to the magnificent Custom, when <hi>Caesar</hi> ordered his Golden Bench to be brought into the Theater, and appear'd there with his Crown adorned with Gold and Gems; this, as <hi>Lipsius</hi> observes, was likewise an Honour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the Gods.</p>
                  <p>The like may also be seen at large in <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s Annals, and <hi>Causabon</hi>'s Comment upon <hi>Suetonius</hi>'s first Book.</p>
                  <p>I have seen on some <hi>Venus Victrix,</hi> in one Hand holding a <hi>Victoriola</hi> or Victory in Miniature, with a <hi>Scutum</hi> along with it, under which are these Words, <hi>Sub quo Orbis Terrarum jacet:</hi> This seems to indicate, that by the Assistance of <hi>Venus</hi> the World must be subject to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Arms.</p>
                  <p>Upon others are <hi>Orbis Terrarum Caduceus, duae Dextrae junctae, Concordia Insignis,</hi> with the <hi>Fasces</hi> and <hi>Securis;</hi> which intimate, that under <hi>Caesar</hi> the World should enjoy Concord, signified by the Two Hands; by the <hi>Caduceus</hi> and <hi>Fasces,</hi> are meant the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the Laws, and their Religion by the <hi>Securis</hi> or Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing-Ax.</p>
                  <p>Upon some are <hi>Caesar</hi> in the Habit of a God, holding in his Right-hand a <hi>Cornu.</hi> which was an Honour dedicated to the <hi>Genii</hi> and to Heroes, and in his Left-hand a <hi>Victoriola</hi> with the Statue of <hi>Mars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others have a <hi>Sacellum</hi> or Temple dedicated to <hi>Iulius</hi> by the <hi>Triumviri.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others a Plow and a <hi>Perticus</hi> or Plow-share used in Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:61347:202"/>
Upon some are the Stern of a Ship, a Globe, <hi>Cornucopia, Caduceus,</hi> and <hi>Apex Pontificalis,</hi> which intimate <hi>Caesar</hi>'s gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the World, and represent Peace, Happiness and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>Some have <hi>Venus Clypeo Caesaris,</hi> and an Eagle fix'd upon an Altar; for then the Surname of <hi>Iupiter</hi> was publickly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Caesar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some have <hi>Minerva</hi> bearing a Trophy with a Dragon at her Feet; because, as <hi>Pliny, Plutarch, Pausanias</hi> and others observe, that Animal was sacred to that Goddess.</p>
                  <p>On those of <hi>Marcus Brutus</hi> is an Anchor with a Dolphin; this indicates the Command or Sovereignty of the Sea, which the <hi>Ejurati</hi> by a powerful Navy assumed to themselves.</p>
                  <p>Some of his also have the <hi>Lyra, Laurus</hi> and <hi>Culter Victimalis,</hi> these all relate to the <hi>Ludi Apollinares,</hi> which in the Absence of <hi>Brutus</hi> were acted.</p>
                  <p>On others of his are <hi>Caduceus Orbis</hi> and <hi>Clavus,</hi> which indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, <hi>Caesar</hi> being slain by <hi>Brutus,</hi> the World should be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with utmost Felicity.</p>
                  <p>Upon some are <hi>Cancer, Acroterion</hi> and <hi>Rosa,</hi> which refer to the Victory of <hi>Cassius</hi> after the taking of <hi>Rhodes;</hi> for the Rose is observable in all the Coins of the City, and the Crab-fish or <hi>Cancer</hi> only indicates the Maritime Places and adjacent Islands; the <hi>Acroterion</hi> indicates Victory after a Naval Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>On others I observed <hi>Mars</hi> naked, with an Helmet on his Head, leaning on a Spear, pressing a <hi>Scutum</hi> with his Foot, in his Left-hand holding a <hi>Flagellum</hi> or Scourge; the first of these intimates the Power of <hi>Mars</hi> in time of War; the last his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in punishing Mutiniers or Offenders; this is the proper Habit of <hi>Mars,</hi> and no doubt, the Ground of it was to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print a lively Idaea upon the Minds of the Soldiers, both as to their Valour and Duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:61347:202"/>
Upon some by the <hi>Urceus Lituus,</hi> and <hi>Pullus Gallinaceus</hi> of <hi>Mark Antony</hi>'s, are delineated his Inauguration. A full Account may be seen of the Superstitiousness of those Times in <hi>Goodwin, Dupry, Rosinus,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>Upon some is one of the <hi>Equites</hi> carrying a Trophy upon his Shoulders, which might probably be stamped after some Victory.</p>
                  <p>On the Coins of <hi>Marcus Lepidus,</hi> who was Tutor to <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Children, may be observ'd one offering a Diadem to a Youth holding an Eagle; this doubtless in their younger Years was to instil into them true Principles of Honour and Greatness, the Diadem being the <hi>Regalia</hi> of the Emperor, and the Eagle a Bird Sacred to <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On some I have observ'd Four Spikes of Corn, designing an <hi>Annona,</hi> or a general Amnesty, which doubtless signifies in that Year the Sacrifices to <hi>Ceres</hi> were numerous; at which Time <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus</hi> return'd out of <hi>Africa,</hi> where he presided and eased the <hi>Romans</hi> of their Bondage.</p>
                  <p>Others have a <hi>Tripos,</hi> out of which a Serpent appears, the <hi>Lituus,</hi> and <hi>Sympulum,</hi> these only design the <hi>Sacerdotia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some have a Vessel betwixt a Thunder-bolt and a <hi>Caduceus;</hi> this by some is thought to intimate thus much, that we ought to spare the Humble, but pull down the Proud; Peace and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency being prefigured by the <hi>Caduceus,</hi> and by the Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt War and Contention.</p>

                  <p>I have seen likewise the <hi>Sellae Curules,</hi> to which there are affix'd Three Lawrels, placed upon a Crown; these were in Honour to the <hi>Triumviri,</hi> they having each of them One.</p>

Some have a <hi>Caduceus</hi> with a double <hi>Cornucopia,</hi> and a <hi>Poppy</hi> on the Reverse; whence it is signify'd, That by the Poverty of some Men Plenty and Security is obtain'd: As in the dubious Fate of War, by impoverishing some Persons, the Fortunes of a greater Number are raised: The double <hi>Caduceus</hi> denotes Plenty, but the <hi>Poppy</hi> may import either Quiet or Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>Upon those of <hi>Cneus Domitius</hi> is the Keel of a Ship with the Sun, because he coin'd that Money when he Commanded in the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea.</p>

                  <p>Some have Two Hands conjoin'd with a Legionary Eagle, and under that the <hi>Rostrum</hi> of a Ship; this denotes Concord both by Land and Sea.</p>
                  <p>I have seen a Palm with a Crown of Ivey, with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, <hi>ALEXANDRIA AEGYPTI,</hi> perhaps, because the Palm was plentiful there; the Crown was of Ivey, because <hi>Antoninus</hi> commanded himself to be stiled <hi>Bacchus,</hi> or because at <hi>Alexandria Bacchus</hi> was the presiding <hi>Genius.</hi>

                  <p>Upon others Piety with a <hi>Cornucopia,</hi> the Stern of a Ship, and a Stork, the Ensign of Piety; because the younger Storks nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish the old Ones.</p>

                  <p>Upon some is Victory standing on a Basis, below her Two Snakes wreathed and raising themselves upwards, which won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully exercise the Learned: It may be, by the Two Snakes is intimated the Division of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire into Two Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that is the <hi>Hospitalitates,</hi> and <hi>Distdia,</hi> which were compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Victory mediating; for the Snake is the Symbol both of Friendship and Division.</p>
                  <p>In some there is Victory sitting upon a Coelestial Sphere, as though she wou'd diffuse her Power above Heaven it self, and holds a <hi>Velamen</hi> in her Hand, which composes a Circle that her Eternity might be by that denoted. So prodigiously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring were the Emperors in those Days, that they even out-did the very Cyclops, who waged War with Heaven it self.</p>
                  <p>Others have a <hi>Caduceus,</hi> and a <hi>Scutum,</hi> stamp'd with the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Sun; these indicate the Felicity of the Times, sought for by the <hi>Ludi seculares,</hi> the <hi>Caduceum</hi> signifies Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the Sun the Age, which by its Circumvolutions it commensurates.

                  <p>Some have <hi>Venus Victrix,</hi> with a Spear and Helmet, and a <hi>Scutum</hi> adjacent, which had for its Ensign a Star; this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably represents the Shield of <hi>Augustus,</hi> which for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his Father he adorn'd with a Star, as likewise his Helmet.</p>
                  <p>Some have <hi>Neptune</hi> pressing the Keel of a Ship with his Foot, in one Hand holding a Trident, in the other a Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin; these bespeak the Sovereignty of the Emperor at Sea.</p>

                  <p>In some are discernable a <hi>Syren,</hi> one half representing a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the other a Bird; this denotes the <hi>Cumaeans,</hi> a Colony brought over to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire by <hi>Augustus,</hi> for <hi>Cumis</hi> was commonly call'd the Body of <hi>Parthenope,</hi> which was one of the <hi>Syrens.</hi>

                  <p>On some there are these Words, <hi>QUERNA CORONA,</hi> a Crown of Oak, perhaps, alluding to the British <hi>Druids</hi> who worshipped under Oaks.</p>

                  <p>And in the Third and Last place make it evident, that in <hi>Nero</hi>'s Time a <hi>British</hi> Queen wore a Golden <hi>Torques,</hi> which sufficiently demonstrates the <hi>Britains</hi> traded with other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before <hi>Caesar</hi> made his Attempts upon this Island, which from the subsequent Observations may fairly be proved to be <hi>Phoenician.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the First; <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 27. gives us this Geographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Account, which, if I mistake not, exactly quadrates with the Reverse of the forementioned Coin; and fully illustrates to us, how from their vast Industry, Skill and Experience in Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they might transplant themselves hither; that the People of <hi>Tirus,</hi> which was one of the chief Cities of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> were seated at the Entry of the Sea, were Merchants and a People for many Isles, that their Ships were made of the Fir-Trees of <hi>Senir,</hi> and their Masts of the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> that they had Oars from the Oaks of <hi>Bashan,</hi> Benches of Ivory from the <hi>Ashurites,</hi> brought out of the Isles of <hi>Chittim;</hi> embroidered Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen from <hi>Aegypt</hi> for their Sails, Blue and Purple from the Isles of <hi>Elisha,</hi> the Inhabitants of <hi>Zidon</hi> and <hi>Arvad</hi> were their Mariners, and the Wise-Men in <hi>Tyrus</hi> their Pilots, the Wise-Men of <hi>Gebal</hi> and Ancients thereof their Calkers, that all the Ships of the Sea were there to occupy their Merchandize, those of <hi>Persia,</hi> of <hi>Lud</hi> and of <hi>Phut</hi> were in their Armies. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve here <hi>Lud</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language signifies <hi>Lydia,</hi> a Country bordering upon <hi>Phoenicia;</hi> that therefore the <hi>British</hi> King assuming that Name (from whom the City of <hi>London,</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:61347:208"/>
as most conjecture, is denominated) seems to me to produce, that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> had discovered the whole Island, since it is probable, he might chiefly affect the Name from some emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Lydian</hi> he most admired among the <hi>Phoenicians;</hi> whether it be so or no, I shall not take upon me to determine: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it may merit the strictest Enquiries of the Learned. That the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> Traded to <hi>Tarshish</hi> is certain, which by the best Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators is esteemed to be the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and likewise to <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, Iavan</hi> and <hi>Meshech,</hi> which signifie the North, amongst which, its probable the <hi>Britains</hi> may be included; that they likewise traded in precious Cloaths for their Chariots, an Instrument only that they as well as the <hi>Britains,</hi> made use of in Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Having now cleared the first Head, I shall proceed to the second, and that is, to prove that their Way of Worship in <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Phoenicia</hi> was the same; which, if I mistake not, duly weighing the preceding Arguments, to wit, the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Words in these Parts and Manner of Fighting, with their prodigious Merchandizing, puts it beyond Contradiction, that this Island must necessarily be inhabited from that Country, in a great Measure at least. The Deities they then worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped retained the following Names, <hi>Andraste</hi> and <hi>Astarte,</hi> of which <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> gives the following Account in his Life of <hi>Nero.</hi> The <hi>British</hi> Amazon <hi>Bonduca</hi> or <hi>Boadicia,</hi> says <hi>Leo,</hi> before she engaged the <hi>Romans,</hi> with her Hands lift up to Heaven, had this Ejaculation; O Astarte, Protectrix of <hi>Women, I invocate thee.</hi> Now the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> as well as she, worshipped <hi>Astarte,</hi> by that meaning the Moon or <hi>Venus,</hi> which sometimes they termed <hi>Venus,</hi> sometimes <hi>Belisama,</hi> sometimes <hi>Diana</hi> and sometimes <hi>Proserpina,</hi> from the benign Influence that they expected from her in the Rivers, Woods, Vallies and their Pleasures, she being stiled <hi>Belisama</hi> upon the Waters, in the Woods <hi>Diana,</hi> in the Vallies <hi>Proserpina;</hi> and when they implored her Assistance for
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61347:209"/>
Pleasure and Felicity, <hi>Venus. Schaedius</hi> likewise in his Account of the <hi>German</hi> Gods gives us a Relation, that they paid a most profound Adoration to this Deity, insomuch, that when she was in her Wane they declined Fighting, of which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> frequently took their Advantage, and made by that Method their Conquests the easier. Their Manner was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, in the New-Moon to engage their Enemy, of which Superstition to this very Day there remains still some Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps, it being a common Custom amongst the Populace upon the first Appearance of the New-Moon to put up a Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to her in the following Form, to wit, <hi>Yonder is the New-Moon, God bless it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall now in the Third and Last place endeavour from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Relick of Antiquity to make it evident, that the <hi>Britains</hi> traded with the Eastern Nations, to wit, <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> and that is from a <hi>Torques</hi> lately found in <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> belonging, as may be supposed, to the <hi>British</hi> Queen <hi>Boadicia:</hi> Of which take the following Account:</p>
                  <p>In the County of <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> in the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> 1700. a poor Man in the Parish of <hi>Patingham,</hi> found a large and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous <hi>Torques</hi> of fine Gold, the Weight of it was Three Pounds and Two Ounces, in Length it was about Four Foot, curiously twisted and writhen, with Two Hooks at each End, cut even but not twisted; one of the Hooks seem'd to have a small Notch in it, as if something had worn it by hanging to it; it was fine Mettal, very bright and flexible, it would wrap round your Arm, your Middle or Hat, and be extended again easily to its own Shape, which most resembled the Bow of a Kettle.</p>
                  <p>It seems to be a <hi>British</hi> Piece of Antiquity for the following Reasons:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:61347:209"/>
First, Its being found near an old <hi>British</hi> City, as Dr. <hi>Plot</hi> in his Natural History of <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> makes that Place to be.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> assures us, that <hi>Bonduca</hi> or <hi>Boadicia</hi> wore a Golden <hi>Torques.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romans,</hi> as well as the <hi>Britains,</hi> wore these <hi>Torques</hi>'s, and probably both of them had it from the <hi>Asiaticks. Titus Manlius</hi> had the Surname of <hi>Torquatus</hi> given him, as an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement of Honour for killing <hi>Gallus,</hi> a Man of a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Magnitude. The <hi>Torques</hi> by <hi>Virgil</hi> is thus descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
<q>
                        <l>—Is petere summo</l>
                        <l>Flexilis obtorti in collum circulus auri.</l>
                     </q>
which exactly quadrates with the Account given of it. From this Instance therefore, we may deduce this reasonable Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary, that since the <hi>Britains,</hi> as well as the <hi>Romans</hi> wore Golden <hi>Torques</hi>'s, and that Gold is not the Product of this Island; and that as it is evident from the Quotation in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> Traded in Gold, Precious Stones, and all the Eastern Spices, and might for these trade with the <hi>Britains,</hi> for Tin, Iron, Copper, and other Products of the Island; that several Colonies of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were seated here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Romans</hi> made any Attempts upon it. The Account of this <hi>Torques</hi> was communicated to me by the Reverend Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> Batchellor of Divinity, and Senior Fellow of <hi>Brazen-Nose-Colledge,</hi> in <hi>Oxford.</hi>

He had a Triumph erected to him: Upon the Louver of the Palace a Naval Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet was fix'd, as if at that Time <hi>Britain</hi> had been the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress of the Sea, and that the Ensign of its new Subjection.

Soldiers upon his Coin, denoting Three Legions, of which the <hi>Roman</hi> Army then consisted, with this Inscription <hi>EXER BRITANNICUS RESTITUTOR BRITANNI.</hi> He built a Wall Fourscore Miles in Length cross the Island, from <hi>Solway Frith</hi> upon the <hi>Irish</hi> Seas to the Mouth of the <hi>Tine</hi> by <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle</hi> on the <hi>German</hi> Ocean.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In his Reign were many Seditious Troubles in <hi>Britain,</hi> the Northern Nations breaking down the Wall which was raised to keep them out, and cut in Pieces the <hi>Romans</hi> that came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: He sends over <hi>Ulpius Marcellus</hi> as prime Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, who by his Conduct soon repell'd them; but being for that envy'd by <hi>Commodus,</hi> he was then speedily recall'd, upon which, through the Licenciousness of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Britains</hi> again revolted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Clodius Albinus</hi> was created <hi>Caesar</hi> by <hi>Commodus,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his Design refused that Honour; yet hearing of his Death ascended the Tribunal, and in an elegant Speech pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Senate to make him Consul.</p>

                     <hi>Helvius Pertinax,</hi> after <hi>Commodus</hi> was slain, was by <hi>Laetus</hi> salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Emperor, being an aged Commander. The Senate moved to have <hi>Albinus</hi> joined with him, but he being jealous of <hi>Albinus</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:61347:214"/>
refused it, and sent him back into <hi>Britain</hi> with a Commission to be his Lieutenant, which <hi>Albinus</hi> revenged by exhorting <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus</hi> to assassinate him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Didius Iulianus</hi> upon his Death bought the Empire: He was slain by the Soldiers that advanced him; <hi>Albinus</hi> being still Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant in <hi>Britain.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> having disarmed the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Bands, but being jealous of <hi>Albinus</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> ordains him his <hi>Caesar</hi> and Successor, himself pretending Age, which the other accepted by this Cajole. <hi>Severus</hi> marches into <hi>Syria</hi> to subdue <hi>Pescennius Niger,</hi> who pretended to the Empire, in a pitch'd Battle overcame <hi>Niger</hi> and slew him, subdued the <hi>Adiabenes,</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Rome:</hi> He then being weary of a Rival in the Empire, sent over Murtherers into <hi>Britain</hi> to dispatch <hi>Albinus,</hi> which <hi>Albinus</hi> too late discovered, and then declared himself Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon <hi>Severus</hi> sent <hi>Onuphrius Heraclitus</hi> to take Possession of <hi>Britain. Albinus</hi> refused to resign, declares for the Empire, erects his own Statue, and stamped his Picture on his Coin, and to justifie himself, with the choice Troops of all <hi>Britain</hi> entred <hi>France,</hi> and near unto <hi>Lyons</hi> took the Field against <hi>Severus; Severus</hi> declares <hi>Albinus</hi> a Traytor, and gives him Battle. The Army of <hi>Albinus,</hi> saith <hi>Herolian,</hi> was very hot at the first, and the Battle seem'd to go for the <hi>Albinians,</hi> insomuch, that <hi>Severus</hi> flying, flung off his Purple Coat and hid himself.</p>
                  <p>Hence the <hi>Britains</hi> concluding all to be their own, fell into Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which <hi>Letus Albinus</hi> the General perceiving, came upon them with fresh Troops, thinking <hi>Severus</hi> had been slain, and design'd to make himself Emperor, and totally routed them; which <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi> perceiving, he reassumes his Robes, recalls his Forces, slays <hi>Albinus,</hi> and recovers a most fortunate Victory.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Severus</hi> divides the Sovereignty of <hi>Britain</hi> between <hi>Vitius</hi> and <hi>Heraclitus;</hi> but in the Year 208, he came himself into <hi>Britain,</hi> where he had many Skirmishes: He built a Wall cross the Island from Sea to Sea, but this by some is supposed to be the same with <hi>Adrian</hi>'s.</p>

                  <p>These are the most remarkable Antiquities relating to this Island during the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, what People preceded them, as is hinted before, is evident from these following Heads, (which if we consider the Remoteness of the Places from each other) clearly evince to us, that the <hi>Asiaticks,</hi> before the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> came hither, had discovered the whole Island and fixed in it various Colonies. For the clearing of this Head I shall begin with the most Northern Part of <hi>Britain,</hi> and thence briefly proceed to the Lands End of <hi>England,</hi> in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I must a little recapitulate.</p>

to the Primitive Eastern Way, of their Numbring of their Days and Nights, as is manifest from that in <hi>Genesis; And the Evening and the Morning were the first Day:</hi> And this evidently transmits to us the great Value and Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Country, and undeniably demonstrates the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity of the History cited from <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 27. rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to their extraordinary Merchandising and Transplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Colonies into distant Countries, which that it may not slip the Reader, I shall here transcribe so far as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to this Matter, though the Head was before touch'd upon.</p>

                     <q>Thy Borders are in the midst of the Seas, thy Builders have perfected thy Beauty. They have made all thy Ship-boards of Fir-trees of <hi>Senir:</hi> They have taken Cedars from <hi>Lebanon</hi> to make Masts for thee. Of the Oaks of <hi>Bashan</hi> have they made thine Oars: The Company of the <hi>Ashurites</hi> have made thy Benches of Ivory, brought out of the Isles of <hi>Chittim.</hi> Fine Linnen with broidered Work from <hi>Egypt,</hi> was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy Sail; Blue and Purple from the Isles of <hi>Elisha</hi> was that which covered thee. The Inhabitants of <hi>Zidon</hi> and <hi>Arvad</hi> were thy Mariners: Thy wise Men, O <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> that were in thee, were thy Pilots. The Ancients of <hi>Gebal,</hi> and the wise Men thereof were in thee thy Calkers, all the Ships of the Sea with their Mariners were in thee to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy thy Merchandise. They of <hi>Persia,</hi> and of <hi>Lud,</hi> and of <hi>Phut</hi> were in thine Army, thy Men of War: They hanged the Shield and Helmet in thee, they set forth thy Comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The Men of <hi>Arvad</hi> with thine Army were upon thy Walls round about, and the <hi>Gemmadims</hi> were in thy Towers; they hanged their Shields upon thy Walls round about: They have made thy Beauty perfect. <hi>Tarshish</hi> was thy Merchant by reason of the Multitude of all kind of Riches; with Silver, Iron, Tin, and Lead, they traded in thy Fairs. <hi>Iavan, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:61347:216"/>
and <hi>Meshech,</hi> they were thy Merchants: They traded the Persons of Men, and Vessels of Brass in thy Market. They of the House of <hi>Togarma</hi> traded in thy Fairs, with Horses, and Horsemen, and Mules. The Men of <hi>Dedan</hi> were thy Merchants, many Isles were the Merchandise of thine Hand: They brought thee for a Present, Horns of Ivory and Ebony. <hi>Syria</hi> was thy Merchant by reason of the Multitude of the Wares of thy making: They occupied in thy Fairs with Emeralds, Purple, and broidered Work, and fine Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, and Coral, and Agate. <hi>Iudah</hi> and the Land of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> they were thy Merchants: They traded in thy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket Wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and Hony, and Oyl, and Balm. <hi>Damascus</hi> was thy Merchant in the Multitude of the Wares of thy making, for the Multitude of all Riches: In the Wine of <hi>Helbon,</hi> and white Wool. <hi>Dan</hi> also and <hi>Iavan</hi> going to and fro, occupied in thy Fairs: Bright Iron, <hi>Cassia,</hi> and <hi>Calamus</hi> were in thy Market. <hi>Dedan</hi> was thy Merchant in precious Riches for Chariots. <hi>Arabia,</hi> and all the Princes of <hi>Kedar,</hi> they occupied with thee in Lambs, and Rams, and Goats: In these were they thy Merchants. The Merchants of <hi>Sheba</hi> and <hi>Raamah,</hi> they were thy Merchants: They occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in thy Fairs with Chief of all Spices, and with all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones and Gold. <hi>Haran</hi> and <hi>Canneh,</hi> and <hi>Eden,</hi> the Merchants of <hi>Sheba, Asshur,</hi> and <hi>Chilmad</hi> were thy Merchants. These were thy Merchants in all sorts of Things, in blue Cloaths, and broidered Work, and in Chests of rich Apparel, bound with Cords, and made of Cedar among thy Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise. The Ships of <hi>Tarshish</hi> did sing of thee in thy Market, and thou wast replenished and made very glorious in the midst of the Seas. Thy Rowers have brought thee into great Waters: The East-wind hath broken thee in the midst of the Seas. Thy Riches and thy Fairs, thy Merchandise, thy Mariners, and thy Pilots, thy Calkers, and the Occupyers of thy Merchandise, and all thy Men of War that are in thee,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61347:217"/>
and in all thy Company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the Seas in the Day of thy Ruine. The Suburbs shall shake at the Sound of the Cry of thy Pilots. And all that handle the Oar, the Mariners, and all the Pilots of the Sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the Land; and shall cause their Voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up Dust upon their Heads, they shall wallow themselves in the Ashes. And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with Sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with Bitterness of Heart, and bitter Wailing. And in their Wailing they shall take up a Lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, saying, What City is like <hi>Tyrus,</hi> like the destroy'd in the midst of the Sea? When thy Wares went forth out of the Seas, thou filledst many People, thou didst enrich the Kings of the Earth with the Multitude of thy Riches, and of thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise. In the Time when thou shalt be broken by the Seas in the Depths of the Waters, thy Merchandise and all thy Company in the midst of thee shall fall. All the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Isles shall be astonished at thee, and their Kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. The Merchants among the People shall hiss at thee, thou shalt be a Terror, and never shalt be any more.</q>

                  <p>So far concerning the first Peopling of this Island of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> from the Eastern Nations, upon which I could have far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enlarg'd very much, but that not falling directly under my Cognizance, I shall wholly desist, and proceed to give a succinct Account of the History of the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Britain.</hi>

We may thus by the many Relicts of <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities, in every Generation still improving, form to our selves some general Apprehensions of that powerful Empire, and its extensive Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, and by the mystick Representations on their Coins, and their votive Inscriptions explain'd, we very readily arrive to to their most Sacred Retreats, and find laid open to our View, all their exorbitant Superstitions, their idolatrous Immolations, the Plurality of their Gods, the impious Ambition, and resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Will of the Emperors, together with the Universal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, and Servile Flattery of all Orders of the Empire paid to them.</p>
                  <p>Tho' as Christians, we may be too apt to pass our Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on their Ignorance and Worship, and at the same time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that such sublime Learning, and singular Perspicuity shou'd produce no better Effects: But if we duely consider the Thing, and take the <hi>Roman</hi> Nation, in the common Acceptation of Mankind, we shall find the Subject worthy rather our Pitty than our Censure; for, if we reflect on the Divine reveal'd Will confin'd only to that Corner of <hi>Asia,</hi> call'd <hi>Palestine,</hi> and all the rest of this immense Globe, involv'd in invincible Blindness, erring through deprav'd Nature, the <hi>Romans</hi> may admit of the same general Excuse, and share the same equal Lot with their Fellow-Creatures.</p>
                  <p>That they were a Nation design'd for Empire, their Character deservedly shows, besides the Situation of <hi>Italy,</hi> which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less is a Plan of Ground seated conveniently for the Conquest of <hi>Europe, Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> the very Genius and Temper of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, with their unerring Conduct in Civil and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Affairs, bespoke them rising to Universal Monarchy. We need not blame them in giving the Denomination of <hi>Barbarous</hi> to all other Nations; for compar'd with their Humanity and Conduct, all preceding Empires, and particular States may be regarded as such; their Ambition extended rather to a Dominion over, than Extirpation of Kingdoms, Obedience and Tribute were chiefly the Goal they aimed at; and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py it was doubtless for many Countries, where their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61347:218"/>
Armies cut their Way to Victory. To close this Chapter;</p>
                  <p>For the Reader's Satisfaction, I shall give a brief Account of their Attempts and Progress upon this Island, the Difficulty of their Enterprize, the Benefits accruing by their Conquests, their high Regard and Esteem for <hi>Britain,</hi> with the ill Consequences their voluntary Desertion occasion'd to that unfortunate People.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Gaul,</hi> that Terrour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, was reduced into a Province, and <hi>Caesar</hi>'s successful Arms had reaped the Spoils of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Belgic</hi> Territories, it was then his Ambition, great as Humanity was capable of, led by a secret Decree of Providence, urged him to the Invasion of <hi>Britain;</hi> but whether it was certainly known then to be an Island, or rather part of a new World, as the Soldiers term'd it, adjoin'd to some remoter Continent, is not now the Enquiry.</p>
                  <p>However, the Country, he tells us, was well Peopled, and Warlike enough, that the Maritime and Inland Inhabitants dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd much, both as to their Way of Living, their Manners, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and Customs; the first having built them Towns not unlike those of <hi>Gaul,</hi> and <hi>Belgium,</hi> whose Dress was much the same; the others were painted, and went naked, lived in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses formed in Woods, and were very Savage; their Way of Fighting was singular to any other of these Western Nations, they made War in Chariots, which they manag'd dexterously, after the <hi>Asiatic</hi> Manner: He found a great Plurality of Kings amongst them; this, tho' it render'd the Conquest more tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and difficult to the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet it was sure to be effected at last, and every petty State, tho' perhaps Confederates with some few Neighbouring ones, were certain to be involved in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Overthrow.</p>
                  <p>It is not my Purpose to particularize the Actions of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, and their Lieutenants here, that being already perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many learned Hands and full, as the Histories of those Times convey to us, I shall only cursorily take notice of some general Things, which may, perhaps, prove of useful Diversion to the Reader.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:61347:218"/>
It was about Fifty Three Years before the Birth of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> made his Two Descents upon this Island; he was doubtless the first publick Invader of it, and Success attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Enterprize, after struggling with Storms and Shipwrecks by Sea, and all the Difficulties of a rough opposing Enemy by Land, his Fortune yet surmounted all; and several of the Southern Counties, (for it was at the <hi>Downs</hi> he landed, as Mr. <hi>Halley</hi> demonstratively makes out,) having felt the Smart of the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms, were compell'd to give Hostages for Peace, and submit to a Tribute imposed upon them. Tho' this was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Footing for the Empire, yet it shew'd the Way to farther Progressions, and gave them a Taste of a Country they parted not with till the last Convulsions of the Empire obliged them: This was the first <hi>Aera</hi> of <hi>Britania</hi>'s lost Liberty, which continues by successive Revolutions to this Day; tho' it is reasonably thought after <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Departure the <hi>Britain</hi>'s paid no Tribute, nor performed any other Articles, but that they lived under their Native Governours as of old, till the Reign of <hi>Claudius Caesar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Great <hi>Iulius</hi> diverted by intestine Wars, made no more Attempts upon it, nor did his Successors the Renowned <hi>Augustus, Tiberius,</hi> or <hi>Caligula</hi> think fit to proceed; <hi>Caligula,</hi> indeed, made a Flourish upon the <hi>Belgic</hi> Shoars, but pleased his Ambition only with some Marine Shells, as vain Trophies of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Ocean.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Claudius</hi> succeeding him, began in Earnest to grapple with these Transmarine Natives, and in <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 43. detatches his Lieutenant <hi>Plautius</hi> from <hi>Gaul,</hi> who successfully landing, had some Engagements with the Enemy, when <hi>Claudius</hi> himself ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving with Elephants, and strong Reinforcements, in a pitch'd Battel routs the <hi>Britains,</hi> and immediately returns. This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit was performed during his Sixteen Days stay in the Island, and Six Months from <hi>Rome:</hi> This Action, as Mr. <hi>Tyrrel</hi> observes, was regarded by the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate as no small additional Glory to the Empire: The Emperor's Son had the Title of <hi>Britanicus</hi> given him; to himself a Triumph was ordain'd, Annual Games
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61347:219"/>
constituted, and Triumphal Arches erected: The Officers in this Expedition were rewarded with Triumphal Ornaments, and all Things performed with high Solemnity; the Title of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanicus,</hi> which many succeeding Emperors espoused, was esteem'd as Glorious as that of <hi>Germanicus, Africanus,</hi> and <hi>Asiaticus:</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this victorious Emperor his Lieutenants finish'd many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Campaigns, and in at least Thirty pitch'd Battels were successful; they pierc'd even to the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> Inhabitants of <hi>Lancashire, Yorkshire,</hi> &amp;c. but met with a bold and vigorous Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position from the <hi>Silures,</hi> possessing <hi>South-Wales.</hi> Here <hi>Caractacus</hi> their King had muster'd his <hi>British</hi> Forces, seiz'd upon advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Passes, secured the Avenues, and very Manfully encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd and commanded his Troops; nothing was defective in his Conduct, or the Courage of his Followers, save Fortune her self, imprison'd on the <hi>Roman</hi> Side: This Great unfortunate General fell a Captive, and his Army a Prey to the <hi>Romans;</hi> himself in Golden Chains was led in Triumph to <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom the Emperor for his Princely and Undaunted Behaviour grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pardon: The Triumph over this <hi>British</hi> Prince, was esteem'd at <hi>Rome</hi> equal to that of King <hi>Scyphax</hi> by <hi>Scipio,</hi> or <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus</hi> by <hi>L. Paulus; Ostorius,</hi> General in <hi>Britain,</hi> had all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of a Triumph decreed him. From these great Advances of <hi>Claudius</hi>'s Arms, we may reasonably conclude, the <hi>Britains</hi> had received deep Impressions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Prowess; first from the Landing and Victories of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> and for many Years afterwards from their Commerce with the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Gallia, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium,</hi> and elsewhere; so that the Keeness of their barbarous Violence seem'd to have lost its Edge; for at <hi>Plautius</hi>'s landing the Southern Counties made little Opposition, but timorously declined to fight, and were easily routed: Its true, indeed, the farther they pierced, the more stout Opposition they encountred withal, as shall be farther taken notice of.</p>
                  <p>But now it was, whether from a Supineness on the <hi>Roman</hi> Side, or indeed from some very severe Injuries imposed on a Part of the <hi>Britains,</hi> or both, they gather to a monstrous Head, and with a very barbarous Violence destroy all before them; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61347:219"/>
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Troops were cut in Peices with cruel De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastations of Towns, and their Inhabitants, whilst they being Masters of the Field, omit nothing that Revenge and Fury could dictate.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Nero</hi> found Affairs in this Province, and in this Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity <hi>Paulinus Suetonius</hi> commanded; he resolves with about 10000 Men to give them Battle, encamps himself advantagiously, whilst the <hi>Britains</hi> headed by an enraged Queen, presuming on Victory, with an Army of 100000 Men engaged them: The Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess fell to the <hi>Roman</hi> Side, with the Slaughter of at least 80000 of the Enemy; this proved a finishing Stroak, and retriev'd all the <hi>Romans</hi> had lost.</p>
                  <p>For some Years afterwards little Action was farther known till in the Year of Christ 71, <hi>Vespasian</hi> mounting the Imperial Throne, sends great Armies and noted Generals into <hi>Britain,</hi> amongst whom was the Great <hi>Agricola</hi> whose Life <hi>Tacitus</hi> gives us more particularly than what we find of any other Lieutenant: In the Eight Years of his Command here, he finished a compleat Conquest of <hi>Britain,</hi> and doubtless had confirm'd it, had not <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>'s Envy recalled him. Like a general Inundation he overthrew all Opposition in many pitched Battles, being still victorious, his Conduct and personal Courage was equal to ancient Heroes, he pierced beyond the Two Friths, now <hi>Dunbritton</hi> and <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and there found new and unknown Nations of the <hi>Caledonian Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains:</hi> His Fleet still coasting along discover'd the Isles of <hi>Orkney,</hi> having finish'd his Conquests by Land, he commanded his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral whom he furnished with all Things necessary to sail round the Island, which was accordingly performed. Many Forts this accomplished General built, and in the Year of Christ 85 deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the Province in Peace and Quiet to his Successor.</p>
                  <p>For many Years nothing further occurs remarkable, save the constant Commotions of the more Northern <hi>Britains,</hi> and some Revolts in the Inland Countries; these obliged the Presence of succeeding Emperors: <hi>Adrian</hi> built a Wall Fourscore Miles long to keep in the <hi>Caledonians,</hi> which was greatly improved by <hi>Severus,</hi> who in Person marched to the utmost Limits of the Island, yet
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61347:220"/>
never engaged in a pitched Battle, but only some tumultuary Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes, wherein and by Surprizes and Sickness he lost 50000 Men.</p>
                  <p>We may hence reflect on the Difficulties the <hi>Romans</hi> underwent in the Conquest of <hi>Britain,</hi> which was not the Business of one Campaign and one Army, for as Mr. <hi>Tyrrell</hi> observes, it cost as many Soldiers and as much Expence to reduce this Province, as it did the Empire in the Reduction of all <hi>Asia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now <hi>Britain</hi> is cemented a Province to Imperial <hi>Rome,</hi> which was continued to be retained in its Allegiance by strong Legionary Forces; and doubtless it was in these Times, and in these Parts they established their Colonies, fixed their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, built their Forts and Cittadels, which improved into fair and spacious Towns, now the Woods being levell'd produced Structures worthy the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatness, their Boggs and fenny Places as numerous in those Days as of late in <hi>Ireland,</hi> were drein'd or rendered passable by Causeways, and their Rivers by Bridges. The <hi>Britains</hi> now relish the <hi>Roman</hi> Manners, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire their Eloquence, leave their Fastnesses in Woods and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit Towns, wear the <hi>Roman</hi> Habits, use Baths, and marry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangably. Husbandry now flourish'd and supply'd 'em with Plenty of Grain, shipping from all Parts arrive, importing all Things necessary for the Pleasure and Use of Man. The <hi>British</hi> Youth were disciplin'd, and prov'd a strong Bulwark to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: Preceding Emperors had drawn large Supplies from hence to assist them in their Wars, but now they were made standing and continued so.</p>
                  <p>Now the revolving Reigns furnish us with the noble Ruines we discover of their Votive Altars, Statues, Coins, and other Spoils of Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>Let us at length view the Empire in its declining State, and see the Island suffer equal Revolutions with it. This unweildy Bulk of <hi>Roman</hi> Greatness opprest with its own Weight, long staggering, at last sunk beneath it; what by intestine Divisions when either Side exhausting their Provinces sheath'd their Swords in each others Bowels, through whose Wounds Foreign and Barbarous Nations made an easie Entrance. <hi>Britain</hi> suffer'd
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61347:220"/>
still in all these Struglings, being dispoil'd of its Youth and Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, for now the Empire could no longer sustain it self against the terrible Invasions of <hi>Goths, Vandals, Gauls,</hi> and other as barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and potent Enemies; amongst all the Emperors that plum'd the Strength of this Island, to the Tyrant <hi>Maximus</hi> is chiefly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed its final Ruine. Most of the Military Forces were drawn into <hi>Gaul,</hi> and never returned, they being either slain or planting themselves in <hi>Armorica.</hi> It was in this Juncture the <hi>Scots</hi> landing form <hi>Ireland,</hi> and joyning with the <hi>Picts</hi> or Northern Natives, break all their Mounds, and ravage cruelly amongst them, prove too strong for the raw undisciplin'd Remains of the <hi>Britains,</hi> who now being deserted and distressed, and ready to fall unto more miserable Captivity, pittifully implored Relief of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> with Promises of perpetual Subjection to them. For once or twice a Legion or two succour'd them, but then hiding or carrying off their Treasures, they bid the forlorn <hi>Britains</hi> an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Adieu, advised them to stand to their own Defence, and boldly oppose the Foe, which how weakly they perform'd, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Annals make manifest. These may suffice for the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Affairs in <hi>Britain,</hi> I shall only add, that in the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Third <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 435. the <hi>Romans</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted this Island, which from the Time of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Landing to this their Dereliction, was the Space of 488 Years.</p>
                  <p>Thus from the Explications of the Heathen Altars, their <hi>Pagods</hi> and various <hi>Genii,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> High-ways, their Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Stations, the Lives and Actions of the Emperors, their Coins, and different Explications of their Reverses, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, with as much Brevity and Perspicuity, as Matters of so intricate a Nature will admit of, to account for the <hi>Roman</hi> History in these Northern Parts. And tho' <hi>Caesar</hi> affirms in his commentaries, that all the Inland <hi>Britains</hi> inhabited in Woods and Fastnesses; yet I think, whoever considers the Country adjacent, and the various Names given to that ancient City <hi>Chester,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the City it self, cannot but conclude he was certainly
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61347:221"/>
mistaken; and he might easily be so, having never advanced his irresistible Legions so far as these Countries. It now remains in the last place, that I give some Account of the <hi>British</hi> Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in those Parts, but since none that I could certainly call such, have occurr'd to my Observations, I cannot expatiate upon that Topick. 'Tis true, indeed, I have seen various Coins, which Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> calls <hi>British,</hi> but since the same Reverses are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently observ'd on the <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, I dare not be positive in that Matter; nor, indeed, does it clearly appear to me, what the <hi>British</hi> Coins were, whether any sort of Mettal or Shells, as the <hi>Americans</hi> have at this day; had they been of any kind of Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, it is very probable that in these Parts, in some Generation or other some of 'em would have been found: Wherefore I can only add further upon that Head, that I have seen a Copper Coin dug up at <hi>Ribchester,</hi> which seem'd to have had a Head, but not like any of the <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Greeks</hi> that I ever yet saw; along with this there was another of an odd kind of mix'd Mettal, such as the <hi>Romans</hi> never used, that I know of, it had no Letters or Stamp, but look'd like a Piece of Money, and seem'd to be a Composition of Tin and Copper. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Matter, so far as I am able to judge, cannot be fully determined, I shall leave every Man to his own Conjectures; and in the next Place proceed to the Explications of the Plates, and not transgress further upon the Reader's Patience, but close the Whole.</p>

            <p>I Desire the Reader would be pleas'd to observe, That when the <hi>Armenian</hi> Language is mention'd, that he would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise take notice of the great variety of pronunciation of the same words amongst those People; in this our <hi>Lexicons</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts are so far from informing us, that though a Man should be Compleat Master of most of their Idioms, yet their variety of Elocution is so great, that should he discourse the different sorts of People from the distant Parts of that Country, he would scarce be able to apprehend their common Conversation. I have been Conversant with several Natives from different Parts of that Country, and find, in some measure, the difference of their Elocution to proceed from a mixture of <hi>Sclavonian</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi> as they differently Border upon <hi>Russia,</hi> and <hi>Persia:</hi> To il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate the truth of this assertion, I shall produce but some few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, which in this Book are recited, relating to those Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that it may be the better apprehended, and doubt not then, but by a thoroughObservation of those, and the Arguments before premised, to satisfie the Unbiass'd, from what Continent this Island was in a great measure Inhabited. The words are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but are as follows: The Moon some <hi>Armenians</hi> pronounce <hi>Lune,</hi> others <hi>Luce,</hi> others <hi>Lucen;</hi> Note here that <hi>Lune</hi> is the Name of that River from which the County of <hi>Lancaster</hi> is denominated. A great River some pronounce <hi>Keat,</hi> others <hi>Geat,</hi> some <hi>Kear,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Kent;</hi> where observe, that the Names of two great Waters upon <hi>Kent</hi> Sands, are <hi>Kear</hi> and <hi>Kent:</hi> Wherefore for any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to derive the Names of those Places, as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do, from the <hi>Saxon</hi> word <hi>Can,</hi> denoting a Corner, to me seems to be a manifest Errour; and I do with a great deal more reason surmise, that they are the small Relicts of the <hi>Asiatick</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies.</p>
