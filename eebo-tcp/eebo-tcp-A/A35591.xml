         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Word of Remembrance, Repoof &amp; Counſel, TO ENGLAND AND LONDON: Put forth by One that <hi>Loves</hi> and <hi>Longs</hi> for their Proſperity.</head>
            <p>OH People of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> remember thy former Zeal, when thou waſt willing of thy ſelf, to enter into a <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> with thy God, with Hands lifted up to the Heavens, that thou wouldeſt Reform, and ſquare thy Life in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, according to the Word of God, and the beſt reformed Churches; for the performance of which, thy Miniſtry did ſound an <hi>Alarm,</hi> for Men and Money, which was anſwered in a large meaſure, in an Army which God furniſhed, with a Spirit of <hi>Prayer</hi> and Courage, in ſubduing thy Enemies, which thou didſt then judge, was an anſwer of thy Dayes of Faſting and Prayer, in which thou didſt greatly rejoyce, and ſet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Dayes of Thankſgiving a part, to praiſe the Lord for his Goodneſs, which thou didſt account at that time Infinite Mercy.</p>
            <p>Theſe thy Enemies being ſubdued, that did Tirannize over thee, both in <hi>Spirituals</hi> and <hi>Temporals;</hi> and God did put a Prize into thy hands, that thou mighteſt have been happy, hadſt thou improved it, but thou didſt grow Proud and Kicked againſt the Lord, and fell from thy <hi>Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Engagements,</hi> and the Mercies now are ſwallowed up in <hi>Selfe-Intreſt;</hi> none muſt now Serve and Worſhip God, but as one Sort of People would have it; and when that could not be obtained, then Hatred and Malice did increaſe, and thoſe that ſtood in the Gap in a day of trouble, muſt now be made the Objects of Scorn and Reproach in the Streets: And this was occaſioned by ſome that carried a great ſtroak in Religion, becauſe they had not their Luſt ſatisfied, to have all brought into one Uniformity in Religion; bitter and ſharp Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were daily; by which means Brethren were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and looked one upon another, as Enemies and Strangers, rather chuſing to cloſe with the common Enemy, that endeavoured to deſtroy them both, then to own one another; which to accompliſh, there was ſecret Deſignes carried on with much Induſtry, for a cloſure with that party, that God had born a Teſtimony againſt, in the face of the Son, to the Terror of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in making of them <hi>like the Chaff of the Summer Threſhing-Floor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Deſigne at laſt taking effect, the common Enemy having now obtained that which they long looked for, thorow the help of thoſe reſtleſs Spirits, who muſt now be the Subjects of Ruin and Diſſolation; but thoſe who had ingaged their Lives, Liberties and Eſtates, and ſpilt much Pretious Blood, to ſave the City of <hi>London</hi> from Diſſolation, by Fire and Bloodſhed, their Houſes from Plundring, and their Wifes from Raviſhment, and their Children from being Murdered; theſe I ſay, muſt now be delivered up to be deſtroyed by a revengful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; in which thou didſt ſport thy ſelf in their being Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, and their dead Bodies ſet upon the Gates of thy City, for the Fowls of the Air to eat, further aſſiſting the Enemy to Perſecute, in filling the Priſons and Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons with ſuch as fear the Lord, that prayed for thee, and ſought thy Welfare; thy Ungratefulneſs is written in Capital Letters, that they that run may read it; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will ſatisfie thee but a great Trade, which to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, thou muſt have a <hi>K.</hi> though thou didſt deſtroy thy Friends: But hadſt thou ever ſuch a loſs of Trade, as now thou haſt, by which Poverty is coming upon thee as an Armed man? Thou didſt complain of Taxes and Oppreſſion, hadſt thou ever the like as now thou haſt, and art like to have? Thou didſt complain of Prophaneſs, and the abuſe of God's Ordinances; but was there ever ſuch Prophaneſs, and Contempt of God's Word and Ordinances as is now? What deſignes there is to deſtroy all Virtue, and to encourage all Vice, I ſhall leave to the Rational to Conſider.</p>
            <p>Oh People of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>London!</hi> I appeal to your Conſciences, whether theſe things be not true, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more of the like nature; Oh! remember how many of you that pretended much Religion, how deep you were in encouraging of Prophaneſs, in making <hi>Bone-Fires, Drinking Healths, Roaſting of Rumps,</hi> to the abuſe of the Creatures, <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Blaſpheming</hi> of the holy Name of God, all manner of <hi>Debauchery</hi> committed, which muſt needs enter into the Eares of the Lord of Hoſt, and do undoubtedly cry unto him for Vengeance upon this Nation and City. Oh! <hi>England</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> look into thy aforeſaid Actions, and repent of thy Wickedneſs, humble thy ſelf before it be too late; conſider how <hi>Strangers</hi> now throng thy Streets, the <hi>Gunſmiths</hi> and <hi>Sword-Cutlers</hi> can inform you, if they will, how the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh Papiſts,</hi> do this day buy up <hi>Armes,</hi> and how they walk in Companies Armed, and how they buy up <hi>Horſes</hi> in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> is notoriouſly taken notice of: Surely theſe things ſpeak no leſs than Ruin to thy Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, if God in much Mercy prevent not; how are the Papiſts <hi>Meetings</hi> this day ſuffered, and Idolatry pleaded for, and the Lord's People who deſire to Worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth, are abuſed in ſuch a manner, as the like hath never been ſince thoſe People have born the Name of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> nor hardly ever before, as it hath of late been.</p>
            <p>Oh People of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>London!</hi> be aſhamed and horribly amazed, for this thy abuſing thy Friends, and ſtrengthening the hands of thy Enemies; was ever Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo Induſtrious to deſtroy themſelves, as you have been? Oh! let my Counſel be acceptable unto thee, and repent, which my Soul deſires; who am one of thy poor Children, that have, and do pray for thee, and ſhall conclude with the Words of my Maſter once to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> Oh! <hi>that thou hadſt known, in this thy day, the things that belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy preſent and Eternal Peace;</hi> leaſt it fall out with thee, oh <hi>England</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> as it did to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that it ſhall be <hi>ſuddenly bid from thine Eyes.</hi>
