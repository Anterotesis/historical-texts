            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I can truly ſay with <hi>M. Higgons,</hi> that the difficultie of this Article did not a little perplexe me, to heare of ſuch differences of ſences, not onely among Proteſtants, whom he hath noted, but alſo among the Romaniſts: ſome of our Aduerſaries holding this deſcenſion of Chriſt to be <hi>vertuall</hi> onely, and not perſonall; and among theſe who defend the perſonall, ſome to beleeue his preſence in the reall hell, and the moſt to fancie onely ſuch a <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> which hath bene proued to be no part of hell. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, concerning the Romiſh ſence of this Article, ſome of themſelues doubting whether it be an <hi>Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Tradition;</hi> and ſome affirming, that <hi>it is not proued by Scriptures.</hi> And finally (not to vrge the Councell of Trent, &amp; other Catechiſmes which haue ſingled out that forme of <hi>Creed as the onely foundation of faith in all Churches,</hi> wherin this Article is awanting:) their owne moſt accompliſhed Ieſuite Suarez to account it an Article of no ſuch abſolute neceſſitie: I thought it neceſſarie to diue deeper into this myſtery, &amp; (as God ſhould enable me) in ſome ſort to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the diſtractions of all parts, which do ariſe from the fore-ſaid differences of expoſitions; ſo farre as otherwiſe they are conſonant vnto Scriptures; by conceiuing that our Aduerſaries (if they wil religiouſly acquit themſelues) muſt grant, that notwithſtanding all theſe diuerſities of ſences attributed vnto this Article, yet both ſides general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do hold that which is moſt neceſſarie to ſaluation, and meerely <hi>fundamentall</hi> herein: becauſe whatſoeuer belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnto ſuch the foundation of faith, from the time of Chriſt his paſſion vnto his reſurrection, conſiſteth in theſe two points, the truth of his death and paſſion, &amp; the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereof; now to explane my purpoſe ſomewhat more particularly.</p>
                  <p>The burial of Chriſt in the graue, was for the auouching and ratifying of the truth of his death and reſurrection. Suppoſe we now, that ſome Chriſtian had not the perfect reuelation of this article of Chriſts burial in the graue, and ſhould notwithſtanding beleeue the truth of his death and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3546:18"/>
reſurrection, with the powerfull effect of both; ſhould he not be thought to be a fundamental Chriſtian, and (though not literally, yet ſauingly to beleeue his buriall? ſeeing the reaſon of the buriall of Chriſt in the graue, was (as I ſaid before) to verifie the certaintie of his death, prouing it to haue bene true, and not phantaſticall. Not that the Article of his buriall, being now ſo euidently reuealed, is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to be beleeued (farre be it from vs thus to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue:) but onely ſuppoſing that there were no better eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences for this Article then ſuch as our Aduerſaries haue for proofe of their ſence in the other, which (as ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Doctors among them haue confeſſed) is not euident by Scriptures, nor yet conſonantly agreed vpon in their Church.</p>
                  <p>Now then, the power which any aſcribeth vnto his deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, is either Chriſts triumph ouer hell, or his deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſouls from hell. For his triumph, euery intelligent Chriſtian will ſay, that as ſoone as it was reuealed, that Chriſt had conſummated his glorious worke of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, all the powers of hell were at their laſt gaſpe. As for the deliuerance of ſoules from hell, euerie one doth likewiſe beleeue &amp; profeſſe that there is no redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatſoeuer of any from hell, but it is wrought by the vertue of the ſame Death of Chriſt, either by ſubuention (as the Romaniſts hold) which is, by deliuering ſouls from hell, wherein before Chriſts death, Patriarks and holy men were impriſoned: or elſe (as the Proteſtants teach) by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, that is, (which maketh more for the glorie of his power and grace,) in preuenting the ſoules of his faithfull, that they ſhould not come into hell: euen by that power of his death (he being the Lambe ſlaine from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world) whereby he freed the ſame Patriarks and all his elect, that they ſhould neuer ſuffer the eternall paines of hell, according to the beleefe of all Chriſtians in the world.</p>
                  <p>This foundation of faith thus ſtanding in the beleefe of all Chriſtan profeſſors, the Romaniſts (notwithſtanding
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3546:19"/>
all the forenamed different ſences) are chargeable to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in both ſides an accordance in that which is abſolutely neceſſarie &amp; eſſential in this point of Chriſtian faith, except they will plunge themſelues into the gulfe of doubtfulneſſe and diſtraction.</p>
