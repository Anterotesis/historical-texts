            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MEeting with this Book in
Manuſcript, and liking
well the Contents thereof, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
ſome of my Friends to give
me their opinions of it; which
they freely did, and told me that
they thought it would be a uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Treatiſe, not only for Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
but alſo for all thoſe that
are curious to be informed in the
Menage of Shipping, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I was incouraged to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the Printing of it. But
the Author neither having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
his Book by any
Dedication, nor Preface<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I
<pb facs="tcp:56870:3"/>
thought my ſelf obliged to beg
the Protection of ſome perſon

knowing your great experience

to lay it at your Feet; and if you

his Majeſty hath honoured me with
that Command of ſo high truſt, the
High Admiral-Ship of his Kingdoms,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56870:4"/>
and becauſe it is not to be denied,
but that a long Peace hath well nigh
worn out all men of Practice and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
(eſpecially amongſt thoſe of
my Rank) in matter of War, and
eſpecially Sea-War; I am, for my
part, deſirous to take the neareſt way,
to the enabling of my ſelf to this my
preſent Charge; and this I conceive
to be, by an Admittance and free Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of ſuch as your ſelf, and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing
with you; to which end I have
now ſent for you, that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

                  <p>For mine own part (my
Lord) I hold it good for us, that we
have an Admiral reſtored unto us,
and eſpecially one of this Mind, with
whom we ſhall not only know our
certain Addreſſes, but find a Perſonal
Acceſs, and a due Diſpatch, and not
be wearied out by over many ſeveral

Puttings-off and Slightings of ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56870:4"/>
this Mind of yours, in reſpect that I
apprehend it very important, that not
only the High Admiral (as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip)
but that all the Generals and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals
of his Majeſties Royal Fleets,<note place="margin">The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and Admirals to be of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Birth.</note> be
of that Eminency of Birth and Title,
as may both ſilence Envy, and draw
on Adventurers and Voluntiers of
Worth and Eminency to ſerve under
them, whereby all Services and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
may be much advanced. And
certainly, when ſuch as theſe ſhall be
free of Acceſs, and deſirous of Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
and withall be found of that
Practice and Knowledge, as that they
ſhall not need to depend too much
upon the prompting of others: It muſt
needs prove a prime Happineſs, not
only to the Seamen in particular, but
alſo to the whole Common-Wealth in
general.</p>

our Sea-ſtrength and Experience:
and ſurely this might not only be

until the Providence of the

it were to be wiſht, that the very

work too much Perfection in all Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

Land, where Councils of War may be
aſſembled at pleaſure; but at Sea, this
(as I conceive) is not performed, but
with much uncertainty, by reaſon of
many Accidents that may hinder theſe
Meetings; whereas nevertheleſs, there is
no Place, where occaſions offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

                  <p>It is true, and therefore (for

that not only the Captain
commanding under the General in his

of all the reſt, but likewiſe that ſome
ſelected and choice Men of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of War be always reſident aboard

have the main ſtroke in the Election
of theſe Men (as it is reaſon he ſhould)
that then he would be pleaſed to
ground his Approbation, not ſo much

                  <p>Surely, my Lord, in reſpect
of the Quantity and Number of the

confeſt, and therefore thoſe few of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
that we have, ought the more
to be regarded and cheriſhed; and
this the rather, in that I am fully of
the Opinion, and dare profeſs it, that
all ſuch as are to command as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
in any Man of War,<note place="margin">His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Ships of War to be commanded by Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> ſerving in

Birth and Education, and that not
only in regard of the better Breeding
(as aforeſaid) of our Nobility in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
in this kind of Service and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
which ſo much concerneth us; but
alſo by reaſon of that free and frequent
Acceſs and Converſe, which in all Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this Nature, is requirable and
unavoidable, betwixt the General and
theſe Captains. And beſides, it may
of due, and with reaſon be expected,
in regard of their very Bloods, that
the Tye of Honour and Reputation
ſhould work more actively upon them
than upon the meerly bred Mariner
and common Seaman, be he other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
what he will. And ſurely, as in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56870:8"/>
the making of a Gentleman an able
Sea Commander, Practice is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Theory; ſo more than
meer Practice is requirable in the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Captain out of a meer Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
For beſides the Civility of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and Behaviour, the which well
becomes the Place and Company they
are to hold, there is alſo a general
Judgment to be ſought after, and an
Entertainment fit for all Perſons and

                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſhall not go about to alter
your Opinion in this particular: For,
as touching the meer bred Mariner,
for mine own part, I am of Opinion,
that even ſuch Seamen as are part
Owners of Ships, are not ſo much as
to be admitted to go Maſters in their
own Ships, whilſt they ſerve in the
Kings Pay; for in this Caſe it may be
probable enough, that ſome of them
will ſhew themſelves leſs forward in
point of Service, and more favourable
to their beloved Ships Sides, Sails and
general Rigging, than ſhall ſtand
with the Honour and Welfare of the
Service; neither can the Redreſs be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56870:8"/>
found by the Captain at the inſtant of
Service (be he never ſo ſufficient,
much leſs if ignorant) becauſe the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
are of neceſſity to be entruſted in
many particulars, and in this eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the Sailing and Conducting
of the Ship is peculiarly belonging un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and is his particular Charge.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>And by the ſame reaſon, and
upon the very ſame ground, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to me unfit alſo, that the Maſters
of ſuch Ships as are in his Majeſties
Service, ſhould be entruſted with the
placing of moſt of the ſubordinate
Officers in thoſe Ships, and have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
for the preſſing of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Men into them; for it may fall
out, that in this Employment, they
may mainly aim, either to bring in as
many of their own Servants as they
can, and that without all reſpect of
Sufficiency; or at the leaſt, of their
old Acquaintance and Confidents, and
ſo make up a Pack, as well for a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as a Concealment, whereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
and act what they liſt, and this
the Captain ſhall be never able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
untill it be too late, and much
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56870:9"/>
leſs redreſs, by reaſon of his coming
in amongſt them as a meer Stranger,
and not being admitted but at the
laſt Caſt, and perhaps not until the
Ships Company do enter into Sea-Victual,
which I dare boldly ſay, is
the ready way to multiply all theſe
Diſorders, and may well cauſe all
men of ability to retire themſelves.</p>

                  <p>The like Exception likewiſe,
or a greater, may be taken (methinks)
to thoſe reſident Officers for term of
Life,<note place="margin">Of the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Kings Ships.</note> which are in His Majeſties Ships
Royal, who are the Purſers, Gunners,

have the means to cull out a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their own Conſorts, who ſhall
mainly depend upon them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be neither ſerviceable nor fit for
the Places and Offices that they are
entred for, nor indeed can be made
uſe of in any other place whatſoever,
upon any occaſion: So that for my
part, I ſhall willingly give my Voice
that none of theſe kind of men, have
ever my Power, or Commiſſion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them to make up their own Gangs
or Companies, when they are to be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56870:9"/>
employed in any Service abroad. I
grant, that whilſt theſe Ships lie idle
in Harbour, or are over the Chain
at <hi>Chatham,</hi> that theſe kind of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
are abſolutely neceſſary; for how
elſe ſhould His Majeſties Ships there
be conveniently guarded and looked
unto? How can the Implements of
their Cook-rooms, their Sails, Cables,
and general Ropes, their Ordnance
and the Appurtenances be kept and
preſerved, the Ships kept clean and
wholſom, unleſs ſome ſuch Officers as
Gunners, Cooks, Boat-ſwains and Swab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
be held always aboard them, and
ſo have their Places for their Lives?
And how can theſe Men be furniſhed
with Victual aboard, unleſs there be
a Purſer to provide it for them? I
deny not therefore, but that ſuch Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
as theſe, are in this Caſe to be
admitted and held on, and it may be
a convenient Reward alſo for ſuch old
Seamen as have been long Servitors,
and well Deſervours in His Majeſties
Employments. But yet it followeth
not, that theſe, and none but they
are to be uſed and had in their ſeveral
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56870:10"/>
Offices during a time of Service, and
when theſe Ships are abroad: becauſe
(at leaſt for that time) they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
over their Stores by Inventory,
to ſuch other as the Captain ſhall find
to be more fit and better known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and be inſtalled in their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
again at the Return of the Ships;
or at the leaſt, that it be left unto the
Captains Choice, whether he will
have them with him or no. And
much leſs doth it follow that theſe
old Officers for term of Life, ſhould
(though they do go the Voyage)
have the only Truſt put upon them,
(the which they now claim by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription)
of the providing and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of their own Gangs, when
the Ships are to be fully Manned;
the Complement whereof, in ſome of
theſe Places, as in that of the Gun-room,
amount in ſome of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
great Ships, to no leſs, than
thirty, forty and fifty in number.
Theſe (ſay I) at all times of Service, are
in all Equity and Providence to fall
within the Compaſs of the Captains
Choice and Ordering,<note place="margin">Captains to chooſe their Officers.</note> that ſo he may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56870:10"/>

touching this particular; for howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
it is likely enough that it will be
diſtaſtful to ſome particulars; yet will
it be found neceſſary and beneficial
for the publick Service in general.
And ſurely, if any Elections of this
kind be left to any, out of the Office
of the Admiralty (and they ſeem to
be over many to be all of them made
there) it muſt needs in all Right and
Reaſon belong unto the Captains,
whoſe Reputations and Credits ſtand

whatſoever you have ſaid

that as the High Admiral, the Generals

by the Prince and State; ſo the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Comanders and Captains are
to be choſen and approved of by the

                  <p>What the Capſtan, the Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boes,
and the Yard Arms are, ſhall be
explained hereafter, when we come to
ſpeak of the Names of the parts of a
Ship. The Puniſhment at the Capſtan
is, when a Capſtan Bar being thruſt
through the hole of the Barrel, the
offendors Arms are extended at the
full length Croſs-wiſe, and ſo tied unto
the Bar having ſometimes, a Basket
of Bullets, or ſome other the like
weight hanging by his neck; in which
Poſture he continueth till he be either
brought to confeſs ſome Plot or Crime,
whereof he is pregnantly ſuſpected;
or that he hath received ſuch condign
ſuffering, as he is cenſured to undergo,
at the diſcretion of the Captain.</p>
                  <p>The Puniſhment by the Bilboes, is,
when a delinquent is laid in Irons, or
in a kind of Stocks that they uſe for
that purpoſe; and which are more or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56870:16"/>
leſs ponderous, as the quality of the
offence is, that is proved againſt the
offending Patient.</p>
                  <p>The Ducking at the Main Yard
Arm is, when a Malefactor, by having a
Rope faſtened under his Arms, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his middle, and under his Breech,
is thus hoiſted up to the end of the
Yard, from whence he is violently let
fall into the Sea, ſometimes twice, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
three ſeveral times one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and if the offence be foul, he is
alſo drawn underneath the very keel
of the Ship, the which they tearm keel-raking,
and being thus under water, a
great Piece is given fire unto right
over his head, as well to aſtoniſh him
the more with the thunder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which proveth much offenſive to
him, as to give warning to all others
to look out and beware. And theſe
are the common and uſual ways of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
of puniſhment upon Sea offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:

theſe Leaks are. As for the ways of
Stopping of them when they are felt a<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Sea, they are commonly two; either
within Board, which is done with much
difficulty, when the Leaks be low a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Ground-Timbers or Hooks,
for then the beſt Remedy is to ſink
down ſome Tallow and Coles mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
and in ſome caſes, ſome Raw
Beef, Oatmeal, Bags, and the like:
But if the Leak be any thing high, it is
readily and eaſily ſtopped, by the
nayling of a Piece of ſheet-lead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Place; and if it come by a Shot,
this is beſt done, by the driving in of
a Plug, (it is a Stopple of Wood)
wrapped about with Canvas.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:56870:19"/>
If the Leak be to be ſtopped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Board,<note place="margin">How Leaks may be found and ſtoped.</note> and that it be not over
low towards the Keel, then it may be
done by cauſing the Ship to heel to
the one ſide, and ſo to faſten ſome
Sheet-lead upon the place; and if the
Leak prove to be over-low, that it
cannot be reached that way, then the
courſe may be to ſtitch or ſow up a
piece of a courſe Sail, or (which is
better) ſome remnant of a ſmall Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
into the Faſhion of a Bag, with
ſome long and well opened Rope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarns
put within it, and then ſinking
this Bag under the Keel, ſo to bring it
up again directly, and as full as
may be, with the Leak, and there to
let it lie, that by the In-draught of the
Water, the Oakam or Rope-yarn that
is within the Bag, may be ſucked into
the Hole or Crack of the Leak, and
thereby become ſtopped that way.</p>

                  <p>All Leaks, where they are,
are eaſily found to be ſo, by the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Pumps, and many other
viſible ways; but the difficulty and
Maſter-piece, is to find where they are,
and in what particular part, eſpecially
when they be low, and near the Keel
of the Ship, that ſo they may be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with the more eaſe, ſpeed, and
certainty; and though there be many
courſes conducing hereunto, as (when
the Leak is great) by the obſerving of
the In-draught without Board, and
ſome other the like, yet I ſhall here
propound unto your Lordſhip only
one, the which, as it is not vulgar,
ſo I hold it for moſt ſure, and it is
by taking of an empty Pot of Earth,
and placing the Mouth thereof upon
ſome piece of a Board within the Hold
of the Ship, and there laying your
Ear as cloſe unto the Pot as you can;
if there be any In-let of Water in the
Ship, you ſhall hereby apparently and
audibly hear it, and the nearer or far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off you are from the Place where
the Leaking is, the more or leſs you
ſhall hear it; ſo that by the removing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56870:20"/>
of the Pot and Board to and fro, and
from one place to another, you ſhall
at laſt, by the Conduction of your
Ear, attain the perfect Knowledge of

Leak is, and ſo the better ſtop it.</p>

                  <p>The Office of this Maſter-Gunner,<note place="margin">The Maſter-Gunner his Place.</note>
is to take into his Charge all
the Ordnance that the Ship carrieth,
to ſee that they be ſerviceably mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſufficiently ſupplied with
Spunges, Ladles and Rammers, that
in foul weather they be traverſed
with Board (eſpecially thoſe of the
lower Tire) and that the Ports be
ſhut and calked up, that at all times
they be throughly breeched and made
faſt, leaſt any one of them ſhould
chance to break looſe, to the eminent
danger of the foundring of the Ship;
and for the time of a Fight, he is to
provide that every Peece be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56870:21"/>
manned; He is alſo to be cautious
and provident in the Guard of the
Powder in the Powder-room, and
upon no occaſion to ſuffer any Fire
to come near unto it, unleſs it be a
Candle in a well-glazed Lanthorn; and
he is to take and give an account of
all the Powder, and of the remainder
thereof at all times: To which end, he
is is to keep a Reckoning in writing
(as near as may be) of every Shot
that is made, and not to make any
Shot without the Knowledge and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Captain, or in his Abſence,
of the Lieutenant or Maſter: He is
beſides to take into his Charge all the
Proviſions belonging to the Gun-room,
which is the proper Rendezvouze
of himſelf and his Gang (to eat and
ſleep in) and is to have there in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
a fit number of Carthrages, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to the Cilenders of all
his Guns (filled with Powder, if any
preſent Uſe be expected) with lattin
Caſes alſo, which ſerve as well to
form as to carry them in a Fight,
and thereby to avoid the danger of
Fire. And in this Gun-room alſo,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56870:21"/>
are to be ordered, and handſomly
placed all the ſmall Shot belonging to

                  <p>This muſt needs be an Office
requiring a Perſon of Honeſty, Care,
and Skill: and I am in doubt, that
though we are become generally
ſomewhat defective in our Sea Officers,
yet in none more than in this. But
what is your Pilots Place and Part?<note place="margin">The Pilots Office and Part.</note>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Pilots are properly thoſe,
who (upon Coaſts and Shores un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to the Maſter) are uſed for the
Conduction of Ships into Rodes or
Harbours, or over Barrs and Sands, or
thorow ſerpentine and intricate Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels;
the which they perform by their
knowledge of the true depths, and
the heights and flowings of the Tides,
and how they ſet from Point to
Point, with the difference of thoſe
aboard, from thoſe in the Channel or
the Shores, and by the blowings of
the Winds, where the Sands are mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
and by Land-marks, which they
are acquainted withal, when they are
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56870:22"/>
to paſs thorow any Channel or Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
And though theſe Pilots are
but rarely entertained whilſt the
Ships are abroad at Sea, or for the
whole Voyage; but having done
their Parts in piloting the Ships out in
the Offin, are returned to the Shore,
where they have their Reſidence, and
get their Bread in this Faſhion; yet
in Ships of Charge and Burthen, it
were no unthrifty Providence to have
one of them always aboard, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all Hazards.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>And I am of that mind too;
For though they may be certainly had
for the piloting outwards bound, yet
is there as much need, if not more,
of having them at the Land-fall, when
the Ship returneth, which may be in
ſuch Weather as that they cannot be
gotten aboard by any means whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
And therefore I ſhall give my
Vote, that to all the Ships Royal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to his Majeſty, there be the
Allowance of a Pilot, or at leaſt, that
one of the Maſters Mates be known
to be very ſufficiently traded this way,
if not the Maſter himſelf. And now
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56870:22"/>
go on to the particular Office and
Charge of the Maſter.</p>

                  <p>The Maſters Place and Duty
is,<note place="margin">The Maſters Duty and Charge.</note> when the Ship is abroad at Sea, to

bring her to her deſigned Ports and
Places of Rendeſvouſe; To which end,
he is to ſee the Ships Company duly
divided and quartered for the true
performing of their Watches, and for
the trimming and management of her
Sails upon all occaſions. He is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and diligently to look unto the

that ſome of the Quarter-maſters be
always ready to cond her; he is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,

upon what points of the Compaſs ſhe
hath been ſteered in every Watch,
and as conducing thereunto, to take
a View of the Traverſe Board, and to

his Aſtrolabe, Back-ſtaff, or Jacobs-ſtaff,
and accordingly to prick his
Card; and upon the approach to any
Coaſt, to uſe the deep Sea-line, or

this is to be done, that he may the
ſurer and readier give an account un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Captain of the Place where the
Ship at any time is; briefly, the Maſter
with his Mates, are the Guids to lead

                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>But there is an extenſion of
the Maſters Office, in all Merchants-Ships
far enough beyond all this that
you mention here: for there I find
them in a Command in Chief, and
ſome of them taking upon them the
Titles of Captains, and to go away
with it too: who (I believe) were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
commiſſioned, either by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,

there miſtaken by ſome degrees in

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56870:23"/>
and it is becauſe our Merchants (the
more is the pity) cannot abide to
have any Gentlemen Commanders in
their Ships; and it may be, the moſt
of Gentlemen are as unwilling as
themſelves. But withal it hath brought
forth this ill effect, even in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties

undergo the Command of a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,

that many times they meet with

                  <p>A Lieutenants Place at Sea,<note place="margin">The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants Place and Part.</note> is
as the Lieutenants Place on the Shore;

in his Way at the firſt (which is an
Humour whereto young men are
much addicted) but to carry himſelf
with Moderation and Reſpect to the
Maſter Gunner, Boat-ſwain and the
other Officers, that ſo he may not be

                  <p>Well then, to conclude, what

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>There is no doubt but that a
Sea Captain commanding in Chief, in
one of His Majeſties Royal Ships, hath
as enlarged a Charge under his Hand,
and of as high a Nature as any Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
at Land; for beſides, that in ſome
of thoſe Ships there ought not to be
fewer than five, ſix or ſeven hundred
men to the due manning of them,
when they are to go out to Sea, the
which amounts well neer to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſome Regiments; all of which
are abſolutely under the Command of
the Captain. He is alſo over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
to ſtand anſwerable to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
for the whole Ship her ſelf, and all
her Ordnance; the Value and Worth
whereof is ſeldom leſs than twenty
thouſand Pounds, and of ſome of
them thirty, yea forty and upwards.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56870:25"/>
And as for the Point of Honour,
What greater Honour hath our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Martial Matters, than in His
Majeſties Navy? What greater Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
(beſides the Loſs) can there be
in this kind to the State, than that
ſuch a Ship as one of theſe, ſhould,
either by the Ignorance, Cowardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or Treachery of the prime Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
fall into an Enemies hand.</p>
                  <p>In few Words therefore, I ſay (my
Lord) that it were to be wiſhed that
this Commander thus entertained in
His Majeſties Pay, and this Service,
ſhould bring with him,<note place="margin">The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Place and Part.</note> beſides an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected
Loyalty, and approved Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;
a full Experience and ſufficient
Skill to enable him, not only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
an Account of all his ſubordinate
Officers in their ſeveral and diſtinct
Charges and Places, but ſo well to
underſtand them when they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up, as to find out all the Fallacies
and Failings, diſcover the Errors and
ſhort Executions, and ſo to correct
and amend them. And thus (my
Lord) I have run through the Task
you enjoyned me, concerning the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56870:25"/>
Commanders and Officers requirable
in a Ship of War; I have done it

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>I apprehend they may be
chiefly theſe three. 1. Some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtinations
and Delays of their Pays,
at their returns Home. 2. A ſtoln
Trade, and Profit that way, which
they find in Merchant Voyages, over
and above their Wages and Hire.
3. The extravagant Hopes that they
flatter themſelves withal, when they
ſerve in private men of War, where
they go upon their Thirds. And
4ly. The looſe Liberty and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled
Life that they lead, when
they are entertained in any of theſe
Courſes; and eſpecially in that of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Men of War.</p>

ſpeak freely.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, touching the firſt of
theſe. The which, ſince I apprehend
it might be occaſioned by thoſe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Disburſments, the which, a long
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56870:27"/>
Diſuſe did put upon the Exchequer,
in the fitting up of His Majeſties
Ships, and the victualling of them out,
together with the Failings of ſuch
Supplies, as upon juſt grounds might
well be relied upon, and were expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
would be continued; there is no
doubt, but that for the future, the
Wiſdom of the State will find it fit,
either to be ſufficiently furniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand,

Military ones; or will forbear

then I doubt not, but that one only
Voyage and Employment, bringing

will help well, to rectifie all former

                  <p>This is not improbable. But
what ſay you to the ſecond motive
that you mentioned, as leading to this
diſlike, which was the Overplus of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56870:27"/>

               </sp>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>This hath in ſome good part,
been already ballanced by his Majeſties
late Augmentation of Sea mens Pay in
general, which hath been improved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
half in half. For there is no
Prince, or State in the World, that
alloweth larger Wages to Sea-men, then

make more of their Bellies than their

                  <p>As for this buſineſs of Pillage,
(which is with them, a going upon
their thirds; and that is, when they
have the third part ſhared amongſt
them, of whatſoever ſhall be gotten) it is
ſure enough, that there is nothing, that
bewitcheth ſo much; nor any thing
wherein they promiſe to themſelves ſo
loudly, and delight in ſo greatly; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch,
that I have known ſome of
them, who though they might look
for a hanging from their own Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
at their return, for their irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
going out; and adventured the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56870:28"/>
the cutting of their Throats, by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
in their going out; yet ſtuck
not to rove into an Enemies Quarter,
two or three Miles, in hope only to
pillage ſome rotten houſe-hold Stuff:
And I ſaw one of theſe returning with a
Feather-bed on his back, all that way,
in an Extremity of hot weather, that
was not worth ten Shillings when he
had it at home. A Voyage and an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
that all the Commands and
Compulſions in the World, nor (as I
think) ought elſe, ſave this (for theſe

                  <p>Surely Experience hath taught,<note place="margin">Mariners not over rigorouſly to be kept on Ship-board, when they are in Harbour.</note>
that thoſe ſo ſtrict reſtraints, which ſo
frequently have been urged of late,
and wherein, the Captains have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſo peremtory Commands againſt
ſufferance of their common Men to go
on ſhore, whilſt they lay in Harbour,
in His Majeſties Ships, which hath been
ſometimes, three and four Months to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
inſtead of preventing a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away, and running from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
(which was aimed at) have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the quite contrary effects; for
theſe prohibitions being not in poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to be made good to any purpoſe,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56870:30"/>
by reaſon of the many Shore-boats,
that haunted the Ships continually,
and ſtole aboard them in the night time;
wherein the Mariners got to the Shore,
in ſpight of all care to the contrary:
They being thus gotten on Shore, and
having there ſpent their little money,
they became (as they grew ſober) to be
ſo gaſtred from a return to their Ships,
for fear of the puniſhment due unto
the breach of the reſtraint, as that as
many of them as could (and ſome of
theſe Officers) conveyed themſelves
quite away, and utterly forſook the
Service; the which but for fear of
this puniſhment, in all likelyhood they
would not have done; and yet would
rather adventure upon any hazard,
then to be ſo impriſoned and ſtrictly
held on Ship-board, within ſmell and
ſight of the Shore, as their Captains
were compelled to keep them.</p>

then only that they are to acquaint the

                  <p>Well Captain, you have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſufficiently to the four particulars,
which you delivered as Cauſes and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the preſent diſtaſtes that
the ordinary Sea-man hath falen
into of late, againſt all Sea Services,
in His Majeſties Ships of War; and I
approve alſo of the remedies you

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56870:31"/>
But you know withal, that the Inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

ſo overgrown, as that upon the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

found with nothing more ready in

ſeen them affronting Juſtice even in

the very Court it ſelf, and Seats of
Juſtice they have been heard in Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults

upon all ſuch, who having been

received his impreſt Monies, ſhall dare
either to run away or hide themſelves

In all which pariculars, it is more then

had been offered to the World and

of the Refractory Run-aways, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>And for the more thorough Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hereof, it is the opinion of ſome Men,
that it were fit that ſome of the moſt
Ancient Sea Captains that have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in his Majeſties Ships Royal,
ſhould be always commiſſioned, for the
ordering of Delinquents of this nature,
and to have Authority in themſelves, and
power to call in unto their Aſſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch of his Majeſties Officers, (as
Coſtanbles, Juſtices of the Peace and the

all Places, where the Offenders ſhall
be found, that ſo due puniſhments may
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56870:32"/>
be inflicted upon all Seamen, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as ſhall be any way, or in any
place, in any of theſe kinds found
in their Inſolencies and Diſorders; and
that theſe Captains, thus commiſſioned,
(that they may be the better known)
ſhould be diſtinguiſhed, by ſome Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon
about their Necks, or Truncheons
in their Hands, or both; the which
they (and none but they ſhould be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

                  <p>I differ not from you in any
of theſe particulars; and touching this
laſt, I aſſure my ſelf, that as it would
work much to a due reſpect of theſe
Captains among Sea-men in general, ſo
it would either reduce theſe Libertines
of our Age, unto their old (Queen
<hi>Elizabeth)</hi> Obedience and Diſcipline,
or leave them to the ſufferance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
puniſhment, without all Excuſe

<hi>Praemio et Paena.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Captain, before I can diſmiſs you,
from this Days meeting, in regard
that I have heard it ſaid and lamented,
that there is, at the preſent, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56870:33"/>
want of Sea-men in general
within his Majeſties Dominions,<note place="margin">A general want of Sea-men.</note> and
that as well in reſpect of number as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency,
I would entreat you to offer
and preſent ſome ſuch Ways and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
for the better breeding and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of theſe ſo neceſſary Hands, as
either in your Apprehenſion, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
or both, you do conceive to be
moſt proper and probable.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Having your Lordſhips Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
for it, and having adventured
thus far already, under your Lordſhip
protection, and with I hope ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
I ſhall readily and briefly
deliver my poor Opinion in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
alſo.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be denyed (my Lord)
but that all Tradings upon the Water,
and every Employment in that kind
of Life, may be allowed and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in their ſeveral Degrees, as ways
tending to the encreaſe and breed of
Seamen; for who knoweth not, but
that the continual rowing in our Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
between <hi>London-bridge</hi> and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter,</hi>
maketh expert Oar-men;
and this is one ſtep (though the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56870:33"/>
loweſt) towards the Attainment of this
Art, and Occupation; and therefore
I hold it good Prudence (by way of
farther improvement) that in all Sea-ſervices
whereinto any Men are impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
ſome numbers of theſe Freſh-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sea-folk,<note place="margin">Water-men and Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to be bred Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> be found out and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
abroad; and that even the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
themſelves, be admoniſhed to
uſe ſome of them aboard their Ships,
in their ſhorter Voyages; provided
that they be no where relied upon at
the firſt daſh; for any farther piece of
the Ships ſufficient Manning, than only
to row in the Boats, and for a while
alſo in fair Weather only; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it is to be confeſt, that there may
be a want and danger.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſay well; for there are
many of theſe Water-men, ſtout and
able; and beſides their daily Practice
at the Oar, the only Air of the Water,
and the motion there, muſt needs make
them ſooner Seamen, then ſuch others,
as are not at all, or but ſeldom uſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, though conſidered but in the
particulars, of Sea-leggs and Sea-ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>The ſecond growth which I
find in our Nurſery of Sea-men, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the ſmall Fiſher-Boats, uſed in
our Rivers, Creeks, and cloſe by the
Shoars; and thoſe of theſe growth
may be admitted unto the ſecond Form
in our Sea-ſchool; for beſides the Sea-leggs,
and Sea-ſtomachs, that they
have very good and perfect, they
have ſome few Ropes and Sayls to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
and mannage alſo; ſome Grapnels to
to employ and look unto, and are
paſſing well fore-ſighted about ſudden
Guſts, Storms, and change of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and therefore I could wiſh, that
of theſe alſo, ſome were always had
aboard and carried out to Sea, that
ſo they might be inured to live out of
ſight of Land, to learn new Ropes
and more Sayls, to get an encreaſe of
Sea-language, and to know and Steer
by the Compaſs; the which they would
nimbly do, and one Degree ſooner,
than your former freſh Water-men;
and therefore it is pity, but that they
ſhould be preſerved in all their Rights,

be encouraged to grow and multiply.</p>

                  <p>A third Rank and Order of

bolder Fiſher-men of ours, who not

their Herrings, but adventure upon the
Coaſts of <hi>America,</hi> and fiſh at <hi>New-found

as they are bolder Men, ſo they have
bigger Veſſels, fitted and rigged with

are carefully to be cheriſhed in their

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56870:35"/>

do attain to be accompliſht Navigators,

that this Coal-carrying Courſe, is not

and taken to, by an Enemy not half

we are fallen upon the point of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Ships, I deſire to know (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we go on in the particular touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

you have, or whether there may
be any Rules of Proportion for the

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>I have heard (my Lord) of
ſome Propoſitions of this Nature;
and ſome would have the Proportion
to be taken after the number and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the great Guns that the Ship
doth carry, with an anſwerable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
of ſome ſpare Hands for the
handling of the Sails. Others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56870:37"/>
that this Rule of Proportion
will hold truer, with a reſpect to the
Ships Burthen; and then they will
have it, that in all Ships, from forty
Tuns of Burthen to four hundred,<note place="margin">Of Rules <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

there be an Allowance of one Man to

ſo ratably downwards; and from four
hundred Tuns upwards, they will
have an Allowance of one Man to
every three Tuns; and then a Ship of
ſix hundred Tuns in Burthen, ſhall
be manned with two hundred men,
and ſo accordingly upwards. But for
mine own part, I cannot find how
this Computation can be brought
within the compaſs of a Certainty, but
muſt be varied and regulated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the length or ſhortneſs of the
ſeveral Voyages that Ships are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
out for, and with a reſpect to
the Services and Occaſions that they
are to be employed in; for who
knows not, but that for a ſhort Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
a ſhorter number of Men may
be ſufficient, than for a longer; where
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56870:37"/>
it may with all reaſon be expected,
that the length of Time, and often

be about the Victualling out of Ships
and Fleets; and in the firſt place I
would be ſatisfied by you (for you
muſt needs know if there hath been
any ſuch matter, having been a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
in all our late Actions abroad)
whether that ſo fierce and general cry,
as well againſt the Quantity as Quality
of the Victuals, hath been juſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly,

                  <p>I muſt needs ſay (my Lord)
that I have only not heard this, but
have had my ſhare of the Trouble
and Ill of it; for the common Sea-man,
finding himſelf never ſo little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56870:40"/>
this way, and miſſing the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualler
to be revenged of (who is far
enough out of his reach, when theſe
kinds of Tryals and Complaints come
upon the pinch and are in agitation) he
takes his next way, either to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,
Maſter, or Captain himſelf, (if he
appear firſt in ſight) and vents his cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and Spleen amongſt them, and
many times againſt them, as if either
they were in the fault, or could redreſs
it, when there is a fault.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>But how comes there to be
any fault; for as touching the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Victuals, I have heard it general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and confidently ſpoken, that there
is no Prince nor State, that, by a good
deal, maketh ſo large an allowance of
Victuals to Sea-men, as His Majeſty
doth; whence is it then, that there
have been ſo many complaints of late
of this nature?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>It is indeed true, that as well
in ways as Victual,<note place="margin">The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of Sea-Victual tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> our <hi>Engliſh</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,
are very tranſcendent, and
in the particular of Victual (eſpecially
of Bread) it is indeed more than can
be eaten; But the Original and ground
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56870:40"/>
of complaint, in this particular, hath
been, in that the Marriner hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
himſelf, to be ſhortned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded
in that Quantity, which they
well know to be allowed unto them by
the State.</p>

                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>And upon examination and

at any time?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>I muſt needs confeſs, that in
our late, and eſpecially lateſt Voyages,
I have more than once found twenty
or thirty of the common Sea-men of
the Ship, waiting at my Cabbin door
at a Dinner time, with ſometimes their
Beef, ſometimes their Pork in their
hands, to ſhew me how ſmall the Pieces
were, and how much under the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
and weight proportioned unto
them for their dues: And this indeed
I evidently found to be ſo, but could
not redreſs the wrong, nor right them,
by reaſon that every Cask and Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
being to contain a certainty of
ſo many pieces of Beef or Pork, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Piece to be of ſuch a weight, if
I ſhould have made up the full of the
weight, that was to have been for the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56870:41"/>
quantity of their allowed Meals, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
particular Perſon, by an addition
of ſome more Pieces, it would of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
have followed, that the general
proportion in groſs, which was to ſerve
ſo many Men for ſo many Months,
muſt have failed long before the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
time of Service abroad would have
expired; the which might have hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a general ſtarving of all the Ships
Company.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>It may ſeem by this, that the due
and full quantity of Victuals in theſe
kinds allowed by the State, for the
Ships Company, and expected to have
been in the Ships Hold, for the prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Time of Service abroad, was not
laid into the Ship; for though there
were the full number of Pieces of Beef
and Pork, yet there was a want in
weight and quantity; ſo that there
were ſo many Pieces indeed as there
ought to have been, but not ſo much
in Subſtance and Fleſh; the which, if
it were ſo, was a foul Couſenage, and
a deſperate Abuſe, and might (as you
ſay) have occaſioned not only a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Mutiny, but a general Ruin.</p>

proceed from ſome inferior Officers, as
from the Butchers and Cutters out of
the Fleſh, or from ſome other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
under-Victuallers, or perhaps from
the ill choice of the Beaſts, as being
Lean and Old, which might cauſe the
Fleſh to ſhrink in the ſeething, rather
than from the prime and general Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualler,
who, I perſwade my ſelf, did

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly in this alſo I muſt needs
ſay, that there hath been found and
felt very ill dealing, and that not only
in the proviſions of Fleſh (which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may be ſomewhat excuſed, by the
unfitneſs of the Time of the Year, that
of neceſſity they were to be made in,
which was in the very Heat of the
Summer when Fleſh will not take Salt)
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56870:42"/>
but in the Rotteneſs of the Cheeſe, vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Butter, and badneſs of the
Fiſh; the which ſorts of proviſions
cannot allow any the like excuſes: And
as for our Beer in general, it was not
only very ill conditioned, but a great
part of it loſt, by a new device of pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſaving,<note place="margin">Iron bound Cask very neceſſary.</note> in not affording ſome Iron
bound Cask for the lower Tire of Beer,
ſo that (for mine own particular, and
I aſſure my ſelf, that I ſuffered not
ſingle in this way) in that Ship of His
Majeſties, wherein I commanded in
the laſt Voyage for <hi>Rochell,</hi> when we
thought to make uſe of that Beer which
(for our laſt Refuge) had been lodged
in our Ballaſt, we found Seventeen
Tuns of it, to be leaked out end for
end, and this only thorough the want
of a few Iron Hoops; ſo that we were
all of us put to the Drinking of Stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>But Captain, what Cure and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatives

                  <p>Your Lordſhip commanding
me to ſpeak, to a point that is ſo fit to
be ſpoken of, I ſhall not fear to do it
freely; And I ſay, that if this great
and general Victualling out of our
Fleets, be a work over vaſt (as many
think it is) to paſs under the Care and
mannagement of one only Victualler (be
he never ſo diligent, ſufficient, and

entruſt divers and different Deputies

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56870:43"/>
of every particular Ship, having the

the Victualler now hath, ſhould have
committed unto their care and charge,
the Victualling out of their own Ships

ſhare, and that to ſuch a quantity, and

that out of this Office there
muſt be providently and timely fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
ſufficient Magazins of all ſorts

that ſufficient means be provided, and

to make up the Main Body of any

may thereafter be ordered and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                  <p>This particular deſerves to be

for it may be feared, that unleſs there be
an application of ſome good means of

will work to ſome farther ill and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
at one time or other, and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we have already miſſed it very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly:
For as it is certain that many
of our beſt Ships, in the laſt <hi>Cales</hi>
action, were in eminent danger of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
at Sea, and of never harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of themſelves again any where,
through the want of hands to mannage
their Sayls, ſo great and general was
the infection and Death of our Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,<note place="margin">Bad Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als cauſe Infectious Diſeaſes.</note>

                  <p>Our badneſs of Victual might

I confeſs, but nevertheleſs two other
ills there were beſides, which concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at that time to enlarge and ſet it
forward; which were, that the Ships
in general were extraordinarily peſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Land Soldiers; and that there
were no Hoſpital Ships appointed in
the Fleet (or at the leaſt but a few,
and thoſe at the lateſt) that ſo the Sick

                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>As for the peſtring of the
Ships, that you ſpeak of, I cannot ſee,
how it could be helped, conſidering
that there were ſo many Land-men to
be tranſported in ſo few Ships.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>It is true, that a Land Army
of any Strength cannot be tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in any long Voyage, but either at
an exceſſive charge by a very numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Fleet, or with an extream danger
of loſs of Men, by Infection and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
when the Ships are over peſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for Land-men (unuſed to the Sea,)
by reaſon of their Sea-ſickneſſes, their
Naſtineſs, and Lazineſs, beget at Sea,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56870:44"/>
a thouſand Diſeaſes, as well to others
as themſelves; ſo that whenſoever a
Fleet is found in this condition, an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial
care and ſtrickt Courſe is to be
taken, that the Ships be not only kept
clean, and waſhed every day, and that
(if it may be) with Vinegar, by the
Swabbers, and have ſome fumes of Tar,
Pitch, and the like often burned below
where the Soldiers Sleep; but that the
Boat-Swains and Quarter-maſters be
injoyned to cauſe the Soldiers to keep
above the Decks, and in the Air, all fair
weather, in the day time; and when it
is foul and rainy that they be held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that ſo they may keep their
Cloaths dry; for there is nothing
more unwholſom at Sea, than to Sleep
in wet Cloathes; the which being once
wet, theſe Soldiers muſt needs do, who
ſeldom have any ſhift or change.</p>
                  <p>And to the end that the Soldiers
may upon all occaſions, be the better
ruled and ordered by the Sea Officers,
whilſt their own Commanders being
as ſick as themſelves (and perhaps ſome
of them as unruly) cannot do it, it
were to be wiſhed that the Sea Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56870:45"/>
(for the time of the Landmens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aboard their Ships) might have as
full a Command over them as their
own Commanders when they are on
the Shore,<note place="margin">Landmen to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Sea Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers at Sea.</note> or at the leaſt, that both
Commanders be ſo equally commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that their Commands may go joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
together; for the Land-Officers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
generally more Subject to Sickneſs,
and diſabilities that way, then (at Sea)
the other are: If it ſhould fall out,
that by their Sickneſs or Death their
Soldiers ſhould be left without a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
there muſt needs be expected
many diſorders and much danger; and
eſpecially when the Landmen do much
overtop the Seamen; It being withal
manifeſtly known, that Land-Soldiers,
are not only ignorant of Sea-ſufferan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but withal very impatient, and given
to Mutinies and Actions of that Nature,
upon the leaſt ſence of Hardſhip in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of thoſe ways.</p>

                  <p>I confeſs that this Courſe
ſeemeth unto me neceſſary enough,
nor need it be taken in ill part by the
Land-Commanders, for (if they be
temperate men) they will rather wiſh
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56870:45"/>
for an Aſſiſtant (eſpecially at ſuch a
Time and in ſuch a place, where them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
may expect to be diſabled by
Sickneſs or otherwiſe) than any way
grudge or be repugnant unto it. But
Captain, what do you farther ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thoſe Hoſpital Ships, that you
ſpake of even now?</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſay (my Lord) that moſt
neceſſary it is in all fleets (eſpecially
ordained for the tranſportation of a
Land Army) that a main care be taken,
that every Squadron of that Fleet, be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
furniſhed with theſe Hoſpital
Ships,<note place="margin">Hoſpital Ships moſt neceſſary.</note> and that theſe Ships be appointed
and known before the Fleet do put out
to Sea; and that they be fited with
convenient Cabbins for the receit of
Sick People; and that each of them
have an able Chyrugion with his Mate,
reſidently aboard, with their Cheſts
and Inſtruments; and that as any, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
common Man, or common Officer
ſhall fall Sick, eſpecially of a Sickneſs
known or ſuſpected to be contagious,
in any Ship of any Squadron, that he
be with the firſt opportunity removed
and received into that Hoſpital Ship,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56870:46"/>
which is ſet out for that Squadron,
that ſo the Sick may not only be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the Sound, but be alſo the
better looked unto, and provided for.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>This is a proviſion both pious
and provident. But let us now return
to our Victuals, wherein there is one
point more that I deſire to be ſatisfied
in; and that is, whether it were not
more beneficial and preſervative for
the Health and Strength of our Men,
that the main of our Victualling, were
in the kinds thereof, altered, and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
fitted to the manner of foreign
parts, rather then as at the preſent with
us, to conſiſt ſo much, of Salt and
Powdred Meats, in Beef, Pork and
Salt-Fiſh?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Without doubt (my Lord)
our much,<note place="margin">Our Salt Victual too much in uſe at Sea.</note> and indeed exceſſive Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon theſe Salt Meats at Sea, cannot
but procure much unhealthineſs and
Infection, and is queſtionleſs one main
Cauſe, that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> are ſo ſubject
to Calentures, Scarbotes, and the like
contagious Diſeaſes, above all other
Nations; ſo that it were to be wiſhed,
that we did more conform our ſelves,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56870:46"/>
if not to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who live moſt upon Rice Meal,
Oat Meal, Biſcake, Figs, Olives, Oyl,
and the like; yet at the leaſt to our
Neighbours the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who content
themſelves, with a far leſs proportion
of Fleſh and Fiſh than we do; and in
ſtead thereof, do make it up with
Peaſe, Beans, Wheat, Flower, Butter,
Cheeſe, and thoſe white Meats (as they
are called.)</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>It were well indeed if we
could bring our ſelves to this provident
and wholſom kinds of Sea-fare; but the
difficulty conſiſteth, in that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sea-men with us, are ſo beſotted
on their Beef and Pork, as they had
rather adventure on all the Calentures,
and Scarbots in the World, than to be
weaned from their Cuſtomary Diet,
or ſo much as to loſe the leaſt Bit of it;
ſo that it may be doubted, that it
would ſet them upon a loathing, and
running away, as much as any other
thing whatſoever.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt,</speaker>
                  <p>I confeſs, that it is no eaſie
matter by any new reaſon, to take of
theſe Lads from an old Cuſtom; and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56870:47"/>
yet would they but patiently conſider
of the well and luſty ſubſtance of
the <hi>Italian, Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who hereby live far more health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
at Sea than they do; or but of
our Colony People in St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi>
the <hi>Barbados, Virginia,</hi> and the <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudas,</hi>
who for the moſt part live, and
thrive well with their Husked-homeny,
and Lob-lolly (as they tearm it) which
they may make of the <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi>
Corn called Maiz, it would perhaps
work them to ſome willing conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in this particular; or if not, it is fit
that they ſhould be uſed like little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

keep a good Diet whether they will
or no.<note place="margin">Maiz, an excellent Sea Food.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But howſoever, ſure I am, that this
Maiz, is a moſt excellent Sea-food,
and moſt proper for long Sea-Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages;
for (as it may be eaſily order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
it will keep extraordinarily, and

                  <p>The ſecond ſort of Pumps, are thoſe
termed Bur-pumps, which are rarely
found in any of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, but
very common with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and
they have them in their Ships-ſides,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56870:51"/>
and call them Bildge Pumps; for their
Ships being built with broad flat Floors,
do hereby hold much Bildge-water,
that is Water, which by reaſon of the
breadth of the Bildge, that is bottom,
of their Ships Floors, cannot come to
the Well in the Ships Hold: And the
manner of theſe Pumps, is, to have a
Staff, ſix or ſeven Foot long, at the
end whereof is a Bar of Wood where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Leather is nailed; and this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
inſtead of the Box; and ſo Men
ſtanding right over the Pump, thruſt
down the Staff; to the midſt whereof
is ſeized a Rope, long enough for ſix,
eight or ten Men to hale by, and ſo
they pull it up, and draw up the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with it; and this kind of Pump
doth deliver far more Water than
the former, and is not ſo laborious to
uſe.</p>
                  <p>The third kinds of Ship-Pumps, and
indeed the beſt, are thoſe called Chain-pumps;
for theſe deliver moſt Water,
and that with moſt eaſe, and are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
the ſooneſt mended: And theſe
Pumps have a Chain of Burs going in
a Wheel, (from whence they have their
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56870:52"/>
Name.) As for the Sea-term in the
uſing of theſe Pumps and all the reſt
them, is, the Pump ſucks, that is as
much as to ſay, the Water is all pumped
out. The Appurtenances belonging to
theſe Pumps,<note place="margin">The Pum-brake.</note> are; the Pump-brake,
that is, the Handle which they Pump
by;<note place="margin">The Pump-Can.</note> the Pump-can, that is a great
Can wherewith Water is poured into

and the Pump-vale,<note place="margin">The Pump-vale.</note> which is the
Trough, wherein the Water that is
pumped out runs along the Ship ſides,

which Scoper-holes,<note place="margin">Scoper-holes.</note> are made through
the ſides of the Ship, cloſe to all the
Deck; and through which the Water
that is any way to be avoided out of
the Ship into the Sea, paſſeth away: and
theſe Scoper Holes, that are made in
the loweſt Deck, have round and long
Leathers nailed over them,<note place="margin">Scoper-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> whereby the
Sea-water is kept out from entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Ship, and yet they give way to
any Water that is upon the Deck within
the Ship to paſs out into the Sea: And
the like Leathers are alſo nailed over
the Scoper-holes in the Manniger, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56870:52"/>
thoſe ſhort Nails with broad Heads,
wherewith theſe Scoper-leathers, are

                  <p>Every man knows (my Lord)
that the Rudder of a Ship (being that
piece of Timber which is hanged on
the Stern-poſts, by four, five, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſix Iron Hooks,<note place="margin">The Pintles.</note> called Pintles;
for which, are fitted certain other I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons

may ſay) the very Bridle or Rains of a
Ship;<note place="margin">The Gudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> whereby ſhe is turned and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
at the Pleaſure of him that
ſtands at the Helm.<note place="margin">The Helm.</note> The which
Helm is put into the Rudder, and by
a Staff (called the Whip) which the
Steers-man holds in his hand,<note place="margin">The Whip.</note> the
Ship is thus governed and directed.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56870:57"/>
Now the narrower the Rudder is, the
better is it for a Ships ſailing, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that the Ship will feel (that is, be
governed and guided) by that Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
for by this narrowneſs, ſhe cutteth
or paſſeth through the leſs Water,
and the better and ſooner will the
Ship feel her Rudder, if in her ſailing
the Water paſs ſwiftly unto it. And
hence is it, that a Ship having a Fat-Quarter
(as before ſaid) the Water
paſſeth hereby but dully unto her Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
whereby her Steerage is hindered.</p>
                  <p>And the Words of Sea-Art belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Steerage,<note place="margin">Port the Helm.</note> are, 1. Port the Helm,
that is in (the Conding, which is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Ship) put the Helm on the left
hand or ſide of the Ship.<note place="margin">Conding.</note> 2. Starboard
the Helm,<note place="margin">Starboard.</note> that is, put the Helm on the
right ſide of the Ship. And it is to
be obſerved, that in Conding, it is
not uſed to bid the Helms-man Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
the Helm,<note place="margin">Larboard.</note> though that be all
one with port the Helm; becauſe (as
I conceive) the Words Starboard and
Larboard being ſomewhat of a near
Sound, in caſe of haſt, the one might
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56870:57"/>
be miſtaken for the other, either by

Danger of all in general. The<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.
word of Art in this caſe is,<note place="margin">Right the Helm.</note> Right

Bear up round,<note place="margin">Bear up round.</note> 
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> let the Ship go

under another Ships Stern, and ſo
gives her the Wind, ſhe is ſaid to bear
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56870:58"/>
under her Lee; when a Ship ſails into
a Harbour before the Wind, or with
the Wind large, ſhe is ſaid to bear in
with the Harbour; and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

                  <p>So ſhall I my Lord. Firſt
then of Capſtans,<note place="margin">Of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan and its parts.</note> there are two
kinds, the Main-Capſtan, and the
Jeer-Capſtan; the Main-capſtan is
that piece of Timber which is placed
next behind the Main-maſt, and the
Foot thereof ſtandeth in a Step, on
the Lower Deck, and the Head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the two upper Decks. The parts
of which Capſtan, are the Foot,
which is the loweſt part thereof; the
Spindle, which is its ſmalleſt part;
the Whelps, which are like Brackets
ſet unto the Body of the Capſtan
cloſe under the Bars; the Barrel,
which is the main ſubſtance or poſt
of the whole Piece; the Holes for
the Bars to be put into; the Bars,
which are ſmall pieces of Timber
whereby the Men heave, and the
Pawl, which is a piece of Iron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56870:61"/>
to one end of the Beams of the
Deck, cloſe unto the Body of the
Capſtan, but yet ſo, as that it hath
liberty to turn about every way, and
againſt it, the Whelps of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan
do ſo bear, that the Capſtan may
be ſtopped from turning or reverſing:
And this Stoppage is termed Pawling
of the Capſtan. Now the main uſe
of this Capſtan, is to weigh the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors,
to hoiſe or ſtrike down the
Top-maſts, to heave into the Ship
any ponderous thing, or to ſtrain any
Rope that requireth a main force.</p>
                  <p>The other Capſtan is called the
Jeer-capſtan, and is placed in the ſame
manner, betwixt the Main-maſt and
the Fore-maſt; and the uſe of this, is
to heave upon the Jeer-rope (of which
more ſhall be ſaid, when we ſhall
mention Ropes in general.) Or to
hold off by, when the Anchor is in
weighing; and at the Foot of this
Jeer-capſtan, are likewiſe fitted cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Whelps, but leſſer than the firſt,
which ſerve to heave upon the Viol
(of which alſo, more ſhall be ſaid
when we come to ſpeak of Ropes.)

the Step,<note place="margin">The Step.</note> whereinto the Foot of theſe
Capſtans are ſet, it is that piece of
Timber wherein the foot of any other
piece of Timber ſtanding upright is
fixed into; as the Maſts and the

Knights and Winding-tackles Blocks.
And into theſe wooden Shivers are
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56870:62"/>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56870:68"/>
The other way (which indeed is moſt

                  <p>It is the Compaſs,<note place="margin">The Gripe.</note> and withal,
the ſharpneſs of the Stem under Water;
and particularly towards the lower end
of the Stem: And the uſe hereof is,
to make a Ship keep a good Wind;
and in this regard, by way of farther
help this way, there is ſometimes put a
falſe Stem to the true Stem, thereby to
make her Gripe the more. But beſides
this, the word Gripe, as it is a Sea
word, expreſſeth as much as, that a
Ship contrary and in ſpight of the
Helm, is apt to run her Head or Noſe
into the Wind, more then ſhe ſhould;
and of this Griping, there are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
two Cauſes: The one, when a
Ship is over deeply loaden a Head;
for then by reaſon of the weight which
preſſeth her down, in that part, her
Head is not apt to fall off from the
Wind: The other cauſe may be, the
ſtaying (that is the ſetting or faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
of the Maſts of a Ship: for a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56870:69"/>
a ſhort Ship, drawing much VVater,
if her Maſts be ſtayed too much aft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
on, it will cauſe her head to be
ever running into the VVind: And all
Floaty Ships, are to ſtay all their Maſts
aftward on very far, or elſe thoſe
Ships, can never keep a good
VVind.</p>

and the Helm tied down cloſe to the
Board (of all which Phraſes, we ſhall
make Explanation hereafter, when we
come to treat of Sails and Ropes) and
ſo to let her lie in the Sea: And when
it blows ſo much Wind, as they cannot
maintain (that is bear out) the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail;
then they will make her Try, with
the Miſſen-ſail only.</p>
                  <p>A Ship is ſaid to Ride, when her
Anchors hold her ſo faſt, as that ſhe
drives not away with the Tide or
Wind; for though ſhe muſt needs
ſhear (that is wave too and again) from
one ſide to the other;<note place="margin">Shear.</note> yet if her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors
hold faſt, and come not home
(as the Sea-word is) ſhe is ſaid to Ride:
Now to Ride well, is not only when

the Ship is made faſt by her Anchors,
in a good Rode (that is in a Place
where neither the Sea,<note place="margin">Rode.</note> nor Wind hath
much power over the Ship) and when
ſhe doth not ſtrain (that is ſtretch)
her Cables over hard: But alſo a Ship
is ſaid to ride well, when ſhe is ſo built,

her ſelf into a Head-ſea, as that
the Waves over-rake her (that is waſh
her) from Stem to Stern:<note place="margin">Over-rake.</note> And a Ship
doth ride at moſt eaſe, and in moſt
ſecurity, when ſhe hath two Cables
ſpliced together (and this is termed a
ſhot and to ride by a ſhot) and the
reaſon hereof is,<note place="margin">A ſhot, and to ride by a ſhot.</note> that the length of the
ſhot, doth allow her more Liberty to
play and riſe upon the Sea than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſhe could have, if ſhe Rode with

that the Ship cannot much ſtrain it:

dangerous to lodge the ſhot in that

true is that ſome Ships Sail not well,

                  <p>Moſt commonly by the Trim
of a Ship,<note place="margin">Trim of a Ship.</note> is underſtood the Swimming
of her, either with her Head deep in
the Water, or her Stern deep, or
upon an even Keel (that is, upright)
now in which of theſe Poſtures a
Ship ſaileth beſt, that is called her
Trim; but this is not accounted her
Trim alone, for ſome Ships are ſound
to ſail well or ill after the manner of
the ſtaying of the Maſts, and the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56870:77"/>
ſlackneſs of her Shrouds, and the like.
And therefore to ſpeak properly, the
true Trim of a Ship, is that Poſture,
or that Ballaſting of her, which moſt
fitly conduceth to her good ſailing.
And the way of finding this Trim, is
when ſailing in company of another
Ship, you one while, for ſo many
Glaſſes or Hours, cauſe your People,
or ſome Weight to be brought to
your Ships Head, and another while,
for the like ſpace of time, do the like
at her Stern, and then the like on an
even Keel, and thereafter to make the
ſame Tryals by the eaſing of her Stays,
or the ſetting them up, and by the
wedging of her Maſts, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wedging
of them, and the like expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments;
and in which ſoever of theſe
you ſhall find, that ſhe makes her
Way beſt, that is truly to be held her
beſt Trim, and accordingly ſhe is to
be held unto it.</p>

the Ballaſt, that is, to divide it into

The Ballaſt is ſhot, that is, it is run from
the one ſide to the other. And when a

                  <p>I ſhall begin then with the
Main-maſt of a Ship,<note place="margin">The Main-maſt.</note> the which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
known to be that which is
raiſed up, and ſtandeth upright in the
midſt or waſte of the Ship, and it is
well and fitly termed the Main-maſt,
as well in reſpect of the length as
breadth. The ſecond Maſt, in reſpect of
Height and Eminency, is that called
the Fore-maſt;<note place="margin">The Fore-maſt.</note> and this is ſeated in
the Fore-part or Fore-caſtle of the Ship.
The third Maſt of thoſe, which are
placed perpendicular and upright, is
that named the Miſſen-maſt,<note place="margin">The Miſſen-maſt.</note> and this
ſtandeth in the Stern or Sternmoſt part
of the Ship; and ſome great Ships
there are, which require two Miſſen-maſts,
and then that which is next the
Main-maſt, is termed the Main-miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen;
and the other, which ſtands next
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56870:80"/>
the Poop,<note place="margin">The Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture Miſſen.</note> the Bonaventure Miſſen. A
fourth Maſt there is, called the Boltſprit,
and this is that Maſt which ſtands for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
in the Head of the Ship,<note place="margin">The Bolt-ſprit.</note> but ſtands
not ſo directly upright as the other,
but ſloaping-wiſe and pointing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
Now of theſe four Maſts, all
of them have their Top-maſts,<note place="margin">Top-maſts.</note> which
are Maſts made faſt and ſetled unto
their heads above, and two of them,
which are the Main-maſt and fore-maſt
have alſo their Top-gallant-maſts,<note place="margin">Top-gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant-maſts.</note>
which are ſmall Maſts ſetled unto the
heads of their Top-maſts, and upon
the heads of theſe Top-gallant-maſts
are ſet up the Flag-ſtaves, which ſerve
to let fly (that is, to ſhew abroad)
the Flags.</p>

a round hole to receive the Maſt; by

hath been ſaid already; and it is
a word diverſly taken in the Sea-language:
Generally by the word Lee,
is meant that part, which is oppoſite to
the Wind;<note place="margin">Lee-ſhore.</note> as the Lee-ſhore is the Shore
which the Wind blows upon; and to
be under the Lee of the Shore,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Lee.</note> is to
be cloſe under the Weather-ſhore, and
that is under the Wind.<note place="margin">To Alee the Helm.</note> To Alee the
Helm, is to put the Helm to the Lee-ſide
of the Ship. What the Lee-latch
is,<note place="margin">A Leeward Ship.</note> hath formerly been ſaid: A Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Ship, is a Ship not faſt by a Wind,
that is, doth not Sail ſo near the Wind,
or doth not make her way ſo good,<note place="margin">To come by the Lee</note> as
ſhe might. To come by the Lee, or
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56870:87"/>
to lay a Ship by the Lee, is to bring her
ſo, as that all her Sails, may lye flat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Maſts and Shrowds, and the
Wind to come right on her broad ſide:
And the way of the bringing of a Ship
by the Lee, is (if all her Sails be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad)
to bear up the Helm hard to
the Wind-wards, and to let riſe the
Fore-tack, and Veer the Main-ſheat,
and take in the Miſſen-maſt; or at the

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>To Veer out a Rope,<note place="margin">To Veer.</note> is to
put it out by Hand, or to let it run
out of its ſelf: as Veer more Cable,
that is, let more of it run out: So
that the word Veer is generally uſed
for the letting out of more of a Rope;
and eſpecially of any of thoſe Ropes,
which are uſed without Board, that is,
without the Ship; as of the Boat-rope,
Log-line (whereof more anon) or of
any other Rope, whereby any thing is
towed. But this word Veer, is not
uſed to any Running Rope, ſave only
of the Sheats, as here of the Main-ſheat:
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56870:88"/>
and then they ſay, Veer out
more Sheat, that is, put out more of it.
This word Veer is alſo uſed, when the
Wind changeth often, ſometimes to one
Point, and ſometimes to another, and
that ſuddenly, as in Storms; and then
they ſay, the Wind Veereth. Alſo
when a Ship being under Sail, with the
Sheat Veered out;<note place="margin">A Ship goes Veering.</note> they ſay ſhe goes loft
Veering, that is at large; for then ſhe
goeth neither by a Wind, nor before
the Wind, but as it were betwixt two;
the which alſo is termed Quartering.<note place="margin">Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>
And this Word Quartering is alſo uſed
when a peice of Ordnance may ſo be
traverſed, that it will ſhoot in the
ſame Line or on the ſame Point of the
Compaſs, as the Ships Quarter beareth:
when a Ship Sails alſo with Quarter
Winds, it is ſaid that ſhe goes quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering.
And thus my Lord, having
done, (as far as I can find or call to
mind) with the Maſts, Yards and
ſails, belonging unto a Ship of War:
we will now proceed (if it pleaſe
you) to ſpeak of the Riggings of a
Ship in general, and of the Ropes
that belong unto her, in particular.</p>

                  <p>In the firſt place,<note place="margin">Rigging.</note> it will be
fit to ſpeak ſomewhat of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word
Rigging it ſelf, that by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
thereof the reſt enſuing
may be the better apprehended. By
the Rigging therefore of a Ship, is to
be underſtood all her Ropes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that belong to her Maſts, Yards,
or any part about her; although in
more particular we ſay ſometimes,
that her Maſts, or her Yards are rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
when ſhe is furniſhed with all the
Ropes belonging unto them only.
And a Ship in general is ſaid to be
well rigged, when the Ropes belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto her, are of a fit ſize; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
when her univerſary Ropes, as her
two main Shrowds, Tackles, Crow-feet,
and the reſt, are all put up: And
a Ship is ſaid to be over-rigged, when
her Ropes, are too big for her; the
which is a great wronging to a Ships
ſailing, becauſe a ſmall over-weight
aloft hinders more that way, then a
far greater below; for it makes a Ship

are hung out at the Yard Arms, and
ſometimes at the Heads of the Maſts,
for a ſhow and Gallantry, or to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
Squadrons, are named Pendants;
(and of theſe we ſhall have occaſion to
ſpeak farther hereafter) but by the name
Pendant in this place, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
that ſhort Rope, which is made
faſt at the one end thereof, either to the
head of the Maſt, or to the Yard, or
to the Clew of a Sail; and it is in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
according to the Place where it is
uſed; and having at the other end a
Block with a Shiver, to reeve ſome
running Rope thereinto: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
the Pendant of the Tackle is
made faſt to the Head of the Maſts,
that is, at the Tops of the Maſts; and
the Pendants to the Back-ſtays, are
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56870:91"/>
made faſt, and do hang down, on the
inſide of the Shrowds. And indeed
all the Yards Arms, excepting the
Miſſen have of theſe Pendants, into
which the Braſes are reeved, and by
them they are eaſily diſtinguiſhed.</p>

                  <p>They are ſmall Ropes,<note place="margin">Tackles.</note> which
run in three parts, having either a
Pendant with a Block faſtned unto
them, or a Lamier; and at the other
end a Block and a Hook, to catch
hold; and ſo heave in goods and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
things into the Ship: and of
theſe Tackles, there are divers ſorts;
as the Boats-Tackles,<note place="margin">Boats-Tackles.</note> which ſtand the
one on the Main-Maſts Shrowds, and
the other on the Fore-Maſt Shrowds,
and ſerve to hoiſe in the Boat; and
withal for<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſundry other uſes: As
alſo the Tackles which belong to the
Maſts, which ſerve in the Nature of
Shrowds to keep the Maſts from ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:<note place="margin">Gunners-Tackles.</note>
As likewiſe the Gunners Tackles,
with which the Ordnance are haled in
and out:<note place="margin">Winding-Tackles.</note> And laſtly; there is a wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tackle of which we ſpake before.
And that part of the Rope of a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56870:92"/>
Tackle which is haled upon,<note place="margin">The Fall.</note> is called
the Fall; but that end thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the Block is ſeized, is named the
Standing part. True indeed that the
word Fall, is alſo uſed in ſome other
acceptations, as a Ship is ſaid to Fall
off, when being under Sail, ſhe keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not ſo near the Wind as is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
and when a Ship is ſaid to have a
Fall, or many Falls, it is meant by
ſome riſings or layings up of ſome
parts of her Decks, higher or lower,
then ſome other of the parts, and is
quite contrary to that which is called
Fluſh.</p>

                  <p>They belong to the Main, and
Fore-maſts, and ſerve to ſuccour (that
is relieve or ſtrengthen) the Shrowds,
and to keep ſtiff the Maſts; and they
have their Pendants made faſt under
the Shrowds at the head of the Maſts,
with a double Block thorough which
is reeved the Swifter; the which at the
Standing Part, hath a ſingle Block
with a Hook, which is hitched in a
Ring by the Chain-wale; and ſo being
haled, doth help to ſtrengthen the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56870:92"/>
Maſts. But the word Swifting in Sea-Language,
is uſed, when Ships are
either brought on Ground, or brought
to a Careen; for then they uſe to ſwift
the Maſts, and ſo to eaſe and ſtrengthen
them: And this is done by laying faſt
all the Pendants of the Swifters and
Tackles with a Rope, cloſe unto the
Maſt, and as near unto the Blocks as
may be; and then, to carry forwards
the Tackles, and ſo to Bowſe them
down, (that is, to hale them down) as
hard and taught, as is poſſible: and
the Sea-word of Command,<note place="margin">Bowſe.</note> is here,
Hoe, Bowſe Men; for the haleing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Tack, is termed the Bowſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Tack; and this is done not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to eaſe the Maſt, but likewiſe to
help to keep it from riſing out of the
Step.</p>

it, as eaſe the Bowlings, or eaſe the
Sheats, &amp;c. Only when the Tack is to

having a Wale-knot at one end, which
is ſeized into the Clew of the Sail,
and ſo is reeved firſt through the
Cheſs-trees, and it comes in at a hole
in the Ships Side; and the uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is, to carry forwards the Clew of
the Sail, and to make it ſtand cloſe
by a Wind; and then the Sails are
thus trimmed, the main Tack, Fore-tack,
and Miſſen-tack, are brought
cloſe by the Board, and over-haled
as forward on as may be: the Bowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are the like on the Weather ſide:
the Lee-ſheats are haled cloſe aft,

Yards are braced aft; and the Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſails

three ſtrands of a Rope, ſo that it

the Tacks, the Top-ſail-ſheats,

ſome other Ropes beſide. As for Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering,
it is when any Rope or any

end, then at the other, as the Tackles
are made tapering, which make them
to purchaſe the better, and withal

                  <p>The Word Pay, in our Sea-phraſe,

all one with Parcelling; the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
are,<note place="margin">Parcelling.</note> that Parcelling is done
with Canvaſs, Paying without Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſs;
and theſe are done, when a
little Canvaſs about the breadth of a
hand, is layd upon a ſeam, newly
Calked, and that is called Parcelling;
and when this ſeam, having no Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſs
upon it, is layd over with hot
Pitch, it is then termed paying; and
the ſecond difference is, that Paying is
allways done with Pitch, Parcelling
with Tar. Sometimes again the Word
Paying is uſed, when a Ship is to tack,
and that all her Sails are a Back-ſtayd
(that is flat againſt the Maſts and
Shrowds) then they ſay ſhe is payd,
or the Ship is Payd; but by the
Word Paying in this place, is meant,
when in the Graving of a Ship, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her ſoil is burned off, they lay on
ſome new ſtuff, as either Tallow and
Sope, or which is beſt, Train-oyl,
Roſen and Brimſtone boyled together;

them to be put out. And in another
Sence, when a Yard is hoiſed up high
enough, or the Top-maſt, they ſay
launce ho, that is, hoiſe no more;
alſo in the Stowing (that is, laying in)
of any thing into the Hold of the
Ship, they ſay, launce aft, or launce
forwards on. Likewiſe when they

                  <p>The VVord Tide is common,
as well to ebbing as flowing, and the
Phraſe is, as well Tide of Ebb, as
Tide of Flood. A VVindward-tide
is,<note place="margin">Windward Tide.</note> when the Tide runs againſt the
VVind; a Leeward-tide is, when the
Tide and VVind go both together.<note place="margin">Leeward Tide.</note>
A Tide-gate, is when the Tide runs
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56870:106"/>
ſtrong.<note place="margin">Tide-gate.</note> To Tide it over, or up into any
Place, is to go with a Tide of Flood
or Ebb, and to ſtop the contrary
Tide at an Anchor, until the ſame
Tide returns. To flow Tide and half
Tide, is when the Tide doth run
three hours (which is four Points)
in the Offin, longer than it doth by
the Shore; where by longer, is not
meant more Hours (for it doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
conſtantly ebb and flow ſix
hours) but the meaning is, that if it
high VVater at the Shore at twelve
of the Clock, it ſhall not be high
VVater in the Offin until three of the
Clock, which is the Bound and time
for the running of a half Tide; and
ſo accordingly, as it ebbs and flows
more, the Sea-men ſay, it runs half
Tide and half quarter, that is, five
Points. VVhen Sea-men are to go into
a Harbour,<note place="margin">Bar.</note> over a Bar or Sand, the
Saying is, that they will bring their
Tide with them, that is, they will
come in with the Flood, that ſo they
may get over the Bar or Sand into the

Sand a Shelf, which is not to be ſailed

                  <p>The ſharpneſs of any Head-land
is called the Point of the Land;
and where they ſay, that two Points
are one in another, it is as much as
that they are ſo juſt in a right Line
one againſt another, as that the one
cannot be ſeen for the other. The
Compaſs alſo is divided into thirty
two Points, repreſenting thirty two
VVinds; and ſailing by the Compaſs,
is ſailing upon a Point. The VVord
Pointing is alſo uſed, when the Strouds
at the end of a Cable (that is, the
ſeveral Twiſts thereof) about two
foot long from the end thereof are
untwiſted; therewith to make Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
of the Rope-yarn, and then to

breading it leſſer and leſſer towards

make them all faſt together, with a
piece of Marlin or the like; and this
is termed pointing of the Cable, and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56870:107"/>
the uſe thereof, is to keep the Cable

with this alſo, if a Sail be ript out of

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:56870:108"/>
but in Top-ſails they ſerve to hale
home, that is, to hale cloſe the Clew
of the Sail to the Yards-arms; when
they hale aft the Sheats of the Main-ſail,
it is to make the Ship to keep by
a Wind; when they hale aft the
Sheat of the Fore-ſail, it is to make
her fall off from the Wind; when a
Ship will not fall off from the Wind,
they flat in the Fore-ſail,<note place="margin">Flat in the Sail.</note> that is, pull
the Sail flat by the Sheat as near unto

And theſe are the parts belonging un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

to every Anchor. The kinds of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors,
are, the Kedger, the Grapnel,
the Stream Anchor: The firſt, ſecond,
and third Anchor; two of which are
carried at the Bow of the Ship, and
thereupon are called, the firſt, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

for Gallies, or Boats to Ride by; and
thus far differ in form, from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

are without Stocks. In Ships of War
theſe Grapnels, thoſe of the lighter

Catch hold of ſome of her Gratings,
Rails, Gun-wales, or the like, and ſo
having a Chain made faſt unto it, they

the Word Board it is various uſed at
Sea; to go aboard a Ship is to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Ship: Board and Board is, when
two Ships touch one another: The
Weather Board, is that Side of a Ship
which is to the Windwards: To make
a Board or to Board it up to a Place,
is to plie it to the Windwards (that is
to turn it up) ſometimes on one Tack,
ſometimes on another. A good Board
is, when a Ship at one turning, or
Tack, hath advanced much to the
Windwards: Within Board, is to be
within the Ship; without Board, to
be without it: Over-board, is to fall,
or be thrown into the Sea: By the

                  <p>Indeed I did not,<note place="margin">Spring-Tides.</note> and it was
a forgetfulneſs. A Spring-Tide is
ſaid to be, when after the Dead Neep-Tides,
the Tides begin to grow high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
and this is about three days before
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:56870:126"/>
the Full or Change of the Moon; and
the top or higheſt of the Spring is
three days after, and then the Water
doth highten moſt with the Floud,
and low moſt with the Ebb; and then
alſo the Tides run much ſtronger and
ſwifter, then in Neeps.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>I Confeſs that too, but ſhall
now make amends. When the Moon
is in the midſt of the ſecond and laſt
Quarters, then fall out theſe Neep-tides;
and theſe are (as it were) op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to the Spring-Tides; and there
are as many days allowed for the Neep,
or falling of the Tides, as for the
Spring or Riſing of them: but in
theſe Neep-Tides, the water is never
ſo high nor ſo low, as in the Spring-Tides;
nor do the Tides run ſo ſwift
in Neeps as at the Springs; and as the
higheſt of the Springs is three days
after the Full or Change of the Moon,
ſo the loweſt of the Neeps is four days
before the full or change; and then
the ſaying is, that it is deep Neep:
and when a Ship wants Water, ſo that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56870:127"/>
ſhe cannot be brought off the
Ground, or out of the Dock, the
Sea-word is,<note place="margin">Neeped.</note> that ſhe is neeped; and

Coats of the Carthrages;<note place="margin">Priming Iron.</note> ſo that the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56870:134"/>
Powder in them may take fire. And
if the Powder in the Touch-hole take
fire, and the reſt that is within the Piece
doth not, then the Saying is, that the
Piece is not well primed; to prevent
which, the Touch-powder is made
ſmall and extraordinarily dry, and
the Gunner hath it in a great Horn by

gueſs at the whole Courſe, and ſo
how far the Ship hath gone, and is
advanced upon her due way; and

putting abroad of any of the Sails,

ſay not, let fall the Sail, but looſe the
Sail. And this VVord of Command

the proper term is, heave up,

Luggage out of one place to another,
either betwixt the Decks or elſe where.
But moſt commonly this term is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to the removing or clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any Goods or Lading in the
Ships Hold, that ſo they may handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be ſtowed and placed; and when
this is to be done, the ſaying is, Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
the Hold.</p>

                  <p>There is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Seeling and Heeling; but that
Heeling is a conſtant or ſteddy lying
down of a Ship on one ſide, either
when ſhe is on Ground, or at an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,
or under Sail; whereas Seeling
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:56870:147"/>
is a ſudain agitation, and violent tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
ſometimes to one ſide, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to the other; as the Sea doth
forſake her, (that is as the Billow of
the Sea doth paſs from under her
ſides, faſter then her ſelf can drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with it;) at what time the Ship
being under Sail is conſtrained to fall
that way after it, and this is called
ſeeling. And when a Ship thus tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
to the Lee-ward, it is called the
Lee-ſeel,<note place="margin">Lee-ſeel.</note> wherein there is no danger,
though it be in a ſtorm, becauſe the
Sea will preſently right her; whereas
when ſhe thus rowls to the Windwards,
there is danger, leſt ſhe ſhould come
over too ſhort, and too ſudainly; and
ſo by the breaking of the Sea right
into her, ſhe ſhould either founder,
or have ſome of her upper works quite
carried away: ſo that Seeling is no
more, then a ſudden Heelings, forced
by the motion and force of the Sea
and Wind.</p>

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:56870:147"/>

                  <p>This is by obſerving by the

commonly uſed when a Ship is going
out to Sea from any Land, thereby
to mark how the Land bears off
from them, that ſo they may keep
the better account, and the ſurer
ſhape their Courſe: They uſe alſo to
ſet the Sun by the Compaſs, and that
is, to obſerve upon what Point the
Sun is at that time, and ſo to know
the hour of the Day: They uſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
when two Ships ſail in ſight one
of another, and eſpecially when a

to ſet the Chaſed by the Compaſs,<note place="margin">Set the Chaſe by the Compaſs.</note>

                  <p>To do a Spell, is the doing

Spell, is when freſh men come to work,
and to ſay, give a Spell, is as much as
to ſay, work in ſuch a mans room;
and thus much for the word a Spell.
But when this word is a Verb, as to
ſay to ſpell, it is uſed when a Sail hath
much wind in it, and more than it
can well bear; for then they ſay ſpell

in ſome main Storm, when they find
the Ship too weak to endure the lying

                  <p>It is that ſmooth water which
a Ship makes a ſtern, when ſhe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the Ship, and by it, a good Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be given of the ſpeed that
a Ship maketh in her going, as alſo,
whether ſhe doth go as ſhe looks (as
they ſay) that is, whether ſhe makes
her way as her Head lies; for if the
Wake be right aſtern, ſhe then makes
her way as ſhe looks; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
if the Wake be found a Point
or two to the Leeward of her Courſe,
then the Ship goeth to the Leeward
of her Courſe accordingly. When
the Ship doth ſtay a-weather of her
Wake (that is) when in her ſtaying,
ſhe doth it ſo quickly, as that ſhe doth
not fall to the Leeward; and that
when ſhe is tacked, her Wake is to the
Leeward, it is a ſure ſign that that
Ship feels her Helm well, and is nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Steerage; when a Ship is in
Chaſe of another Ship, and hath gotten
as far into the Wind as ſhe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
ſaileth directly after her, then the
Saying is, that ſhe hath gotten into her

is certain, that every Age and indeed

every fifty years of time, taught by
ſenſe, and perhaps beaten unto it, by
being beaten, after a tedious travail,
brings forth ſome new Birth or other
to free it ſelf from the old Burthen:
As for example our Saucy Neighbours
the <hi>Dunkirkers,</hi> finding it to their
coſt, how ſhort they fell of matching
with us at Sea, in the late Queens
time; and in what peril they then
adventured to pilfer abroad: To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
this and ſecure themſelves, they
have of late fitted themſelves with
Ships, (though not great) yet of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
ſail; whereby it is come
to paſs, that (as the Sea word is) they
can take and leave upon all our Ships
at pleaſure, that is, they can out-ſail
and fetch them up, when they find
themſelves too ſtrong for any of our
Ships; and run as faſt away from
them, when they perceive themſelves
over-weak to deal with them.</p>

                  <speaker>Cpt.</speaker>
                  <p>It is true; and this hath been
one main reaſon and a true cauſe of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:56870:156"/>
thoſe frequent braves and bold darings
that they have put upon us of late
days; and that they have brought ſo
much loſs upon our complaining Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
and we taken ſo little revenge
upon them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>I believe it well. But why
ſhould not our Ships ſail as well as
theirs?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Of theſe there may be many
and ſundry cauſes,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Ships ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the cauſes.</note> as, the ſize of
ſome of our Ships; for it cannot be
expected, that a Ship of any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Burthen; as of eight, or ſix
hundred Tuns, being heavily Laden
with Ordnance, ſhould poſſibly ſail ſo
yare, or nimbly, and make ſo good
way, as another Ship that is leſſer
and lighter. The faſhion alſo and
frame of a Ships make and building
is very conſiderable, in the point of
her ſailing: For the long Rake of a
Ship forward on (as moſt of the
<hi>French</hi> and ſome of theſe <hi>Dunkirkers</hi>
have) give a Ship great way; and
withal makes her to keep a good
Wind; but then Care muſt be had
(as aforeſaid in the laſt Dialogue) that
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:56870:156"/>
ſhe have a good full Bow, leſt ſhe
pitch over much into a head-Sea; and
the longer her Rake is, the fuller
muſt be her Bow, to preſerve her
from being over-charged with her
Rake. And the very ſame may be
conſidered in the Run of a Ship; the
which being long, and coming off
handſomly by degrees, that ſo the
Water may come the more ſwiftly to
her Rudder, and ſo help her Steerage,
is of main importance likewise, for a
Ships good going. And it is to be
noted, that the narrower the Rudder
of a Ship is (if ſhe will feel it, and
that ſhe have a fatt Quarter) the
better it is for this purpoſe; becauſe
an over broad Rudder holdeth much
Water, whenſoever the Helm is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionly
put on the one ſide; the which
muſt needs hinder the Ships way.
The ſetting and ſitting of the Maſts
of a Ship alſo, is very Material in
this Caſe; for if ſhe be over-maſted,
either in length or bigneſs, it will
over-charge her, and ſo make her to
lye down too much to a Wind; for
the more upright a Ship ſails, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:56870:157"/>
ſhe ſails: And if ſhe be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſted,
ſhe then loſeth the benefit
and advantage of the ſpreading of a
large Sail; which muſt needs hinder
her ſailing that way.<note place="margin">Touching the ſtaying of Maſts, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-rigg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Ship.</note> There is much
Care and conſideration to be <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
likewiſe, as touching a Ships Sailing
and Working, in the point of the
ſtaying of her Maſts: For generally
the more aft (Flemiſh like) the Maſts
of a Ship do hang, the better the Ship
will keep the Wind; and ſome Ship
require the ſtay to be taught, others
ſlack; the which muſt be caught by
practice and obſervation. To this
end alſo Regard is to be had, that a
Ship be not over-rigged, for this (as
hath formerly been touched) is a
great wronging to a Ships ſailing, by
reaſon that a ſmall weight aloft, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
more than a great one below: for
it muſt needs make her ſtoup, and in
a good Gale of Wind to lye too much
with her quick ſide in the Water;
eſpecially if ſhe ſail by a Wind: and a
Cranck-ſided Ship can never ſail
well: So that theſe particulars, or any
one of theſe, as they are more or leſs
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56870:157"/>
punctually obſerved, or neglected, do
work much towards the good or bad
ſailing of all kinds of Ships whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
Though perhaps, the more
particular cauſe of our Ships being ſo
generally out-ſailed by the <hi>Dunkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
and <hi>French,</hi> is (as I conceive)
in that for the moſt part, they are
built ſo ſtrong, and (conſequently)
heavy, and ſo full of Timber and
Timbers: We building ours for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
years, they theirs for ſeven:
We for ſtowage, they for ſtirring.</p>

ſay thus much, that even in a Royal
Fleet, thus compoſed, and thus diſpoſed,

ſome of theſe lighter ſort of Ships, and

charging them upon any Angle, ſhall
force thoſe they charge, to give ſome
ground, and ſo to fall back and retreat
upon their next Fellows; in which
falling back, as many of them as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle,

                  <p>This may well be ſo indeed,
when the hundred Ships are compelled
to fight in cloſe order: But how if
they ſhall find opportunity to put

that they are but half ſo many in

                  <p>And I ſay (my Lord) that
as touching their Burthen and Bulk,<note place="margin">Of what Burthen Ships of War are to be of.</note> I
ſhall make choice of thoſe of the
middle Rank; for theſe well mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the beſt of ſail, and withal
will bear a ſtout ſail, and are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>But what ſay you touching
the faſhion and form of their build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and contriving?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſay that the three Deck't
Ships, built fluſh fore and aft, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any falls or ſteps up or down
(which both hinder the ready paſſage
of men too and again, and peſter the
Ship beſides) and that have double
Fore-caſtles, and their Bulk and Cub-bridge
heads full Muſquet proof; and
ſo in flank one with another, as that
they may every way ſcoure their
Decks with their Ordnance laden
with Caſe-ſhot, and having Loop-holes
for the Muſqueteers in Covert,
commanding every Inch of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;
are thus far Ships impregnable,
that they are not to be forced by any
boarding, unleſs given up by Treaſon
or Cowardice.<note place="margin">Ships of War, how to be built and fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> But in theſe Ships
a prime Care and regard is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
that they be Roomy betwixt the
Decks, where the Ordnance lye, that
ſo the Guns may be the more easful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
managed, and that thoſe that
plye them may make the ſurer ſhots,
and be the leſs annoyed with the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:56870:161"/>
Smoak of the Powder; and a Care
is likewiſe to be had, that in the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Decks, the lower Tire of
Guns be not lodged too low and near
the Water (an error found committed
in too many of His Majeſties Ships
Royal that are of the old building)
but that the lower Tire of Guns
may be carried out in all ſighting
Weathers, without peril of taking
in of Water at any of their Ports;
and it is alſo to be obſerved, that
theſe Ships be not over-flote built;
(a fault amongſt ſome others in ſome
of thoſe late built Pinnaces called the
Whelps) for being ſo, unleſs the ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Maſts be very much aft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
on, they can never ſail well by
a Wind, but proving Leeward ſailers,
they will be ſoon eaten out of it, in
a Chaſe of any length: It is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
alſo, that the Bows and Chaſes
of theſe Ships be ſo contrived, that
out of them they may ſhoot as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Guns right forwards, and bowing,
as poſſibly may be; and that the
Ports be ſo cut out, as that the Guns
lye not right over one another, but
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:56870:161"/>
ſo, that upon the leaſt Yaw of the
Helm, one Piece or other may ſtill
be brought to bear: To which end
alſo the Ports are to be made ſo large,
that the Guns may be every way tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed.</p>

to the ſizes of the Ships, that are

Ships of War being (in mine opinion)
from four hundred, to eight hundred
Tuns of Burthen; I may hereupon
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:56870:162"/>
conclude, that the main of their Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
is to be from a Saker at the
loweſt, to a Demy-Canon at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt;
and ſo to be choſen and brought
aboard according to the burthen of
the Ship: for though ſome few Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Murtherours may be uſefully
placed in ſome particular parts; and
ſome Morter-pieces, and Canons-Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
may be had alſo, to do executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon a boarding, yet for the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of Service, and ſo of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
I cannot approve of any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the weight of a Demy-Canon,
in reſpect of their unmanageableneſs
at Sea, nor of a lower degree than is

                  <p>As for theſe my Lord, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
in regard of their lightneſs,
they may ſeem very deſirable, yet in
reſpect of their unruly reverſe,
which is cauſed by their lightneſs; ſo
that they are not to be uſed on Ship-board,
unleſs their Trucks and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
be ſo framed, as by the ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Trucks, their Reverſe may
be hindred; and that being ſo framed,
they become thereby well nigh as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manageable
as any of the heavier Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and are beſides, by reaſon of the
thinneſs of their Metal, very quickly
ſo over-heat, as not to be uſed in any
long and hot fight: It is therefore my
Judgment of theſe alſo, that they are
not to be held in any great account for
Services at Sea; ſo that I ſhall rather by
far make election of thoſe kinds of
Guns formerly mentioned, and ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known, than of any of theſe new
deviſed ones: And then whenſoever
all the forenamed particulars touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ships of War ſhall be punctually
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:56870:163"/>
obſerved, and thoſe Ships aptly and
thoroughly fitted with thoſe kinds of
Ordnance as I here preſcribe, I ſhall
for mine own part conclude, that theſe
are the only Veſſels and Men of War,
that I would make choice of to ſerve
and fight in: And that not only for
the taking ſhort of <hi>Dunkerkers,</hi> and
ſuch like, as ſhall infeſt our Channels

alſo of all rich and deſirable Prizes,

                  <p>And now Captain, ſince it is yet
but early day, we will make up this
days diſcourſe, with ſomewhat of Sea-complement,
and Naval Ceremonies;
for our Ships of War, being once on
flote, and Predy, it is to be expected
that ſome good Company will come
aboard; and therefore it is fit to know
how to entertain them at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with due and decent Ceremonies:
The which howſoever I believe to be
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:56870:163"/>
various, according to the Cuſtoms of

Perſons are, upon whom they are to be

                  <p>Notice being given, that upon ſuch
a Day, the King in Perſon, or the

ſome General of a preſent Fleet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
to viſit any of his chief
Ships, before they go to Sea, and to
be publickly, and with Ceremonies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and entertained aboard. By
the break of that Day, the Ship is in
every part to be made neat and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and to be trimmed with all her
Flags, Enſignes, and Pendants: And
the Ships Barge, to be ſent from the
Ship to the Shore, early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:56870:164"/>
well furniſhed with Carpets,
Cuſhions, Tilt, and the like; the
Cockſon with his Whiſtle, in her
Stern to ſteer, and the Barges Gang,
in their cleanlyeſt Cloaths, or Liveries,
to Rowe; and as ſoon as the Prince
(or any of the forenamed Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers)
hath ſet foot within the Barge,
the Standard Royal, or the Flag is to be
let fly or heaved out in her head, the
which Flag or Standard is afterward, at
his coming aboard the Ship, to be put
abroad in the Main Top. Upon the firſt
kenn of his Barge from the Ship, the
Ships Decks, Tops, Yards, and Shrowds,
are all to be thorougly Manned, and
as it were hung with men: upon the
nearer approach of his Barge, the
noiſe of Trumpets are to Sound, and
ſo to hold on, until he come within
leſs then Muſquet Shot of the Ships-ſide:
At what time the Trumpets are
to ceaſe, and all ſuch as carry Whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
are to Whiſtle his Welcome three
ſeveral times, and in every Interim,
the Ships whole Company are to hale
him with a joynt ſhout after the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of the Sea. As ſoon as the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:56870:164"/>
VVhiſtles and the ſhouts of Salute
have done, the Trumpets are again to
Sound his welcome to the Ships-ſide;
and the Ships-ſide, and Ladder being
thoroughly Manned with the primeſt
and beſt faſhioned Men, the Captain
is to ſtand ready upon the Deck, by
the Ships-ſide to receive him (if he
be the Prince) upon his Knee, and
thence to conduct him into all the
principal Rooms and Offices of the
Ship, and at laſt into the great Cabin,
royally furniſhed to his retirement
and repaſt: And being at his Meat the
Muſick is to be at hand, and all the
Guns to be ready Laden and Primed,
that he may Command what Healths
he pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>And thus having entertained him,
and fully informed him in all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
He is in the like manner to be

with any of His Majeſties Ships, either

them to paſs under her Lee, after
the Cuſtom of the Sea, and in their
going by, to ſalute her, with one,
three, or five great Guns, the which
are to be anſwered with fit correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.
And this I conceive fit to be
done, not only in regard of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of Superiority to the

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:56870:166"/>

                  <p>It is the general cuſtom alſo,
upon the death either of the Captain,
Maſter, or Maſter Gunner of a Ship,
when they are at Sea, at his throwing
over board, to Ring his knell and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
with ſome Guns, the which (as I
ſaid before) are to be always of an
even number; and the which Cuſtom,
for reſpect and diſtinction ſake, I think
fit enough to be held on.</p>

                  <p>It is the uſe likewiſe (though
this be rather a part of a puniſhment
than a Complement, as was formerly
noted when we ſpake of Sea-puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
that when any Oſſender is
ducked at the Main-yard-arm, to
ſhoot off ſome one, or two Pieces of
Ordnance, at the inſtant of his falling
into the Water; the which is done,
as well to make the penalty the more
terrible, by troubling and aſtouning
him with noiſe, when he is over head
and ears in the Sea, as to give know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
thereof to all the other Ships of
all the Fleet, that they may look out
and beware.</p>

out in the Tops of Ships, and they
ſerve, as Badges, and that as well for
the diſtinctions of Nations, as Officers

in the Fore-top, and the Rere Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
in the Miſſen-top, with the Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:56870:168"/>
uſual and common even with Fleets
of Merchant Men, agreeing amongſt

(either in reſpect of right of

their Superiors: As in the caſe of
Soveraignty in our narrow Seas, which
hath been long claimed, and made
good too by the Kings of <hi>England:</hi>
If therefore any Fleet whatſoever,
ſhall, in any of thoſe parts, meet with
any Admiral of his Majeſties, giving
notice of her ſelf, and having her Flag
flying, and ſhall not ſubmit to this

But Captain how if two of His

meet one with another at Sea; how is

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly my Lord, I ſee no
Cauſe, that being both Generals and
Commanders, under one and the ſame
Princes Commiſſion, and as you put
the Caſe, without all relation or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority
or Superiority one unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in any point of Command, but
that both of them may, and ought to
keep abroad their Flags, although
there ſhould be found ſome Perſonal
In-equalties betwixt them; as the one
(perhaps) a Lord, the other a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</p>
                  <p>And I have heard it argued, and
concluded, that the Admiral of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> narrow Seas, is to carry out
his Flag in all Companies and Fleets
whatſoever, unleſs the Standart of
<hi>England</hi> be flying abroad, which is as
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:56870:169"/>

                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>But what if any of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties

he then to carry out his Flag yea or
no?</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>

Man can deny,<note place="margin">Flags be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Princes Ships to he carried out within the Command of any of his Caſtles.</note> but that he is of
due to carry out his Flag, though he

                     </gap> Land, and
both of them employed in His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Service, and the Commanders
being diſtinct in their Commands, and
without all Relations of Inferiority,
or dependency, there is no cauſe or
ground to be found, for a ſubmiſſion
on either ſide. It is ſufficient (as I
ſaid before) that they ſalute one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with ſome Guns, and that the
Comer in begin firſt.</p>
                  <p>I know well, that there have been
ſome Land Commanders, who have
hotly argued to the contrary; but
until I do find them leſs partial, and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:56870:170"/>
more reaſonable, they ſhall give me
leave to diſſent from them in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular:
For whereas they think to
ſpeak much for themſelves in ſaying
that the Land Fort is a ſetled one,
and the Sea Fort, but a wanderer;
they herein ſpeak againſt themſelves,
ſince that Fort ſeems to be more prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
which may do His Majeſty Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in more places then one, then
that which can do it but in one only.
But howſoever ſure I am, that this
point of challenge is not hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
for them, in any of the Martial
Courts of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>They are placed in the Sterns

there are, whether Men of War, or

them. And the eſpecial Service and
uſe of them is, that when any ſtrange
Ships meet one with another at Sea,
or make into any Harbour, by puting
theſe Enſigns abroad which (as before
ſaid) is in Sea-language termed the
heaving out of the Colours in the
Poop, they manifeſt, and make
known of what part and Country
they are: And thus the <hi>Engliſh</hi> heave
out their Colours with St. <hi>George</hi>'s

                  <p>Your Lordſhip hath heard
ſomewhat of theſe already, as well in
the begining of this Dialogue as in the
next before it, ſo that I ſhall only
touch upon them here again, with
ſome addition of ſome others in that
kind;<note place="margin">The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in Haling of Ships.</note> I ſay therefore, that when
ſtrange Ships meet at Sea, it is the
Cuſtom that the better Ship (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
being a Man of War) calleth firſt
unto the other, to know whence he is,
and whither he is bound, and then
the common word is, Hoe the Ship,
and the other anſwers Hae, &amp;c. And
this is termed haling. And many
times, it they fall out to be reſpective
friends or good acquaintance, they
ſalute with Whiſtles, and Trumpets,
and the Ships Company give a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſhout on both ſides; at which
time alſo, it is punctually obſerved,
that the Inferior Ship, either in reſpect
of worth, or employment doth paſs
by under the others Lee; for at Sea,
if a ſmall Ship (eſpecially being but a
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:56870:172"/>
Merchant Man) ſhall come up with a
Man of War to the Windwards,
(though both be of one Nation and
Party) it is held as unmannerly and
unreſpective a trick, as if a Conſtable
of a Pariſh ſhould juſtle for the Wall
with a Juſtice of Peace, dwelling in
the ſame hundred.</p>
                  <p>But to ſay ſooth, there is more than
Ceremony in this Ceremony; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
advantages may be loſt, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
incurred, by the ſuffering of Ships
to come up with them to the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and therefore no true and
well practiſed Man of War will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
it, if he can by any means help
it. And touching the reaſons hereof,
your Lordſhip may hear when we are
to ſpeak of Sea-ſights.</p>

                  <p>The only one,<note place="margin">The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of ſtriking the Top-ſails.</note> that I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
(unſpoken of) is that of ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or lowering of the Top-ſails (as
they call it) And this is, when any
Inferior Ship or Fleet, being to come
up or to paſs by, within reach of the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:56870:172"/>
Cannon of another Fleet, more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in any reſpect than it ſelf; that
then all the Admirals of the inferiour
Fleet, do not only ſtrike all their Flags,
but that every particular Ship of
that Fleet, as they come up, with the
Admiral of the other (by way of an
acknowledgment of a reſpect and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion)
do ſtrike all their Top-ſails
upon the Bunt, that is, do hale them
down, at the leaſt half Maſt high.</p>
                  <p>And this reſpect is alſo due, to all
His Majeſties Forts of Command,
and is requirable from all Ships
whatſoever (not being of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
own, nor in his ſervice) when

the Rere-Admirals; the which being
diſtinguiſhed by their Flags and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
are to put themſelves, and (as
near as may be) in their Sailing to
keep themſelves in their cuſtomary
places: As the Admiral with his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
to ſail in the Van, that ſo he may
lead the way to all the reſt, by the
view of his Flag in the Main-top, in
the day time, and by his light or Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn
in his Poop in the night. The
Vice-Admiral and his Squadron, to
ſail in the Battel or middle of the
Fleet. And the Rere-Admiral and
thoſe Ships of his Squadron, to bring
up the Rere.</p>
                  <p>This I ſay is the moſt common and
uſual order for the ſailing of great
Fleets: Only in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleets, that

this is, becauſe, for the moſt part, thoſe

(by their being more in number,
and having the fewer Ships in their

                  <p>I well approve of all theſe

                  <p>I confeſs that the difficulty is
indeed great, yet may be much eaſed
by due care and obſervation; the
which is to be ſo much the more, in
regard that it is a point of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.
To which end alſo, beſides
the common Cuſtom of carrying
out of Flags, and Lights by all the
Admirals in their Poops, ſeveral ſigns
are to be particularized, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
in the Inſtructions ſent to every
particular Ship of the Fleet, before
their putting out to Sea, whereby it
may be known, even in the dark of
the night, when the Admiral General,
upon any occaſion caſteth about,
when he ſhortneth ſail, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
to lye a-trie, when a-Hull
ſigns, are likewiſe to be imparted, both
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:56870:176"/>
by day and night, that when any of
the Fleet are too far a-head, they may
retire, by ſparing of ſome ſail, or
when they are too far a-ſtern, to cauſe
them to make all the ſail that they can,
to get up.</p>
                  <p>Peculiar ſignals are alſo to be made,
and known to every Ship of the Fleet,
that having loſt Company, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afterwards again in ſight one of
another, they may preſently be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
one unto another: As likewiſe
when any ſtrange Fleet or Ship is ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or falen upon by any Squadron or
Ship, either by day or night.</p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary alſo,<note place="margin">Signals, for trying, Hulling, knowing one another to be made and known.</note> in all great
Fleets, that ſome ſignal be privately
imparted to the Captains of every
Ship, for the diſtinguiſing of any
ſtrange Ships whatſoever, that ſhall
happen to fall in amongſt them, and
be ſuſpected by any one.</p>
                  <p>And this may be done, by the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of ſome Flag, to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
either in reſpect of Colour,
or by the place where it is to be put
out; the which upon View (in the
day time) is to be anſwered by all the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:56870:176"/>
reſt of the Ships of the Fleet: And
the ſame, in like ſort, and to the ſame
purpoſe, may likewiſe be performed
in the night if (coming up one with
another) ſome peculiar Word be given,
for every day in the Week, and ſo
from Week to Week; the which upon

                  <p>And a point this is ſo neceſſary to be

the want hereof, I have known, that
divers ſtrange Ships have paſſed through
the very midſt of a main Fleet even
at noon day, without any diſcovery
made upon them, or ſcarce any notice
taken of them, until it was too late.
And my ſelf, with a ſingle Ship, did
once the like by night, through the

and that you have expreſſed
the way and manner of giving of them,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:56870:177"/>
in one only particular, which was for
the diſcovery of all ſtrangers; I pray
take the pains, to let me know (touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the reſt of them) as well how
they may be contrived, as how order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and placed, that they may be beſt
ſeen, and diſcerned one from another.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Though I do conceive that
this may eaſily fall within the Compaſs
of every ordinary Invention, and may
be varied thereafter; yet ſince it is your
will, to have them more punctually
laid down; and that it may perhaps
ſave ſome Men ſome labour, I ſhall
willingly obey and ſhall do it, in as
many particulars as I can now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member;
and that according to ſuch
ways and forms, as (in mine opinion)
may beſt conduce to the uſes and ends.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>And becauſe I apprehend, that
the Maſter-piece of this Work, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
in the through diſtinguiſhing
of theſe ſignals, and the making of
them perceptible one from another,
that they may not be miſtaken, and
in the fit ſeating of them to the view
of the whole Fleet, be it never ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:56870:177"/>
that ſo they may be perfectly
known and diſtinguiſhed, I ſhall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apply my ſelf herein to theſe two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.<note place="margin">Signals, for ſetting out to Sea.</note>
Firſt therefore, when the
General intends upon ſuch a day to
make out to Sea, with his whole Fleet;
a fit Signal hereof may be, to cauſe
his Top-ſails to lie looſe upon the
Caps, very early that Morning; and
if it prove to be hazie and dark Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo that the Fleet being great, or
lying ſcattered at an Anchor, may not
well diſcern it, he may then, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two or three hours before he
begin to wey his Anchors give fire to
a ſingle Piece of Ordnance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of Councils of War, and Councils ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</note> if being at Sea, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
require a general convention of
the Captains and Maſters aboard the
Admiral, the ſignal may be, the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of a yellow Flag in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt
part of the Admirals Main
Shrowds: But if this be for the aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Council of War only, a
blew Flag may be hung out in the
ſame place; for I conceive this part to
be more proper, than in the Miſſen
Shrowds, (though that be the moſt
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:56870:178"/>
received part for this turn) in regard
that it is more viſible and better to
the kenn.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if the General ſhall find
cauſe, to caſt about in the night (for
if by Day, this needs no ſignal) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that Light or Lanthorn, which
every Admiral carrieth in the Poop,
the moſt perceptible ſignal hereof,
that I can think of, may be, to put
out one light in the Main top alſo:
And if he intend to lye a-Hull, then
two lights: If a-Trie, three lights,
the which may be ſhewed for ſome
convenient time, until it be perceived
that it is perceived by the whole Fleet.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If any part of the Fleet,
by being too far a-head, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to ſhorten ſail, and ſo to attend
the coming up of the Admiral; the
ſign hereof may be, to heave a Flag a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in the Admirals Fore-top, and
if need be, to give a Gun withal, to
cauſe them to look out; and on the
contrary, if any of them be too far
a-ſtern, to hang out the ſame Flag in
her Miſſen-top.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="349" facs="tcp:56870:178"/>
Fifthly,<note place="margin">Signals, upon the diſcovery of ſtrange Ships and Fleets.</note> If upon the diſcovery of any
ſtrange Fleet or Ship, it ſhall be the
Generals will to have any of his Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces,
and beſt ſailers, to make up with
them, and to chaſe them, and ſo to
cauſe them to come to ſpeak with him;
an apt ſign may be to give fire to a
Piece of Ordnance or two, out of his
own chaſe, and withal to put out a
Flag in his Bolt-ſprits Top.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">And for the Battel.</note> If a Fleet ſhall meet with a
Fleet of Enemies, known to be ſo,
and after due conſultation aboard the
Admiral, it ſhall be found fit to fight;
the ſignal hereof may be, that the
Admiral taking in his ordinary En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
heave out in its ſtead an Enſign
all over red, which is called the
bloody Colours; that ſo all the Fleet
may diſpoſe and order themſelves, to
fall on upon the Enemy, in ſuch form
and faſhion as they have formerly been
informed and inſtructed in, and have
time to fit themſelves for a Sea-Battel.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are all ſuch neceſſary
Cauſes, as require any ſignals to be
expreſſed by the General himſelf, out
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:56870:179"/>
of his own Ship: for as for the reſt
as they are to be communicated with
the whole Fleet, and every particular
Ship thereof, ſo they are rather to be
expected from any one of them, than
from the Admiral himſelf.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>And what may theſe be?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>That if any Ship of a Fleet,
ſhall diſcover any ſtrange Fleet or
Squadron of Ships, or ſingle Ship;
as it is fit, that not only the General,
but the whole Armado, ſhould as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
as may be, receive advertiſement
hereof; ſo the ſignal to this purpoſe
may be, by putting abroad ſome
Flag on that part of the Ship which
pointeth moſt upon the diſcovered
ſtranger; and if it be a Fleet that is ſo
diſcovered, to hang out two Flags in
the ſame manner, and withal to give
fire to a great Gun or two, that ſo
ſhe may be looked after.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe,<note place="margin">Signals up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Land.</note> whenſoever a Fleet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the Sea, expecteth a Land-fall,
the firſt Ship that maketh Land,
is to give preſent notice thereof to the
reſt of the Fleet; and this ſhe is to do
(if it be by day) by ſhewing her Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:56870:179"/>
abroad, though it be (for a time)
in the Main-top it ſelf, inclining
them to that part whence Land is
diſcovered; and if this fall out in the
night, ſhe may then ſhoot off two
pieces of Ordnance, and ſhew a light,
and withal caſt about and ſtand off,
that the reſidue of the Fleet may take
notice and beware.</p>
                  <p>If any Ship of a Fleet ſhall find
her ſelf in danger of foundring in the
Sea,<note place="margin">And of dangers by Leaks, or the like.</note> by ſpringing of a leak, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
miſchance; if this be by day ſhe
may ſhoot three pieces of Ordnance,
and then cauſe a yonker to go up to
the Main-top, and ſhew a waft: And
if this happen in the night time, to
continue the ſhooting now and then
of a ſingle piece, and withal to ſhew a
light, that ſo ſhe may be taken notice
of, found out, and relieved. And
becauſe there may be many occaſions,
whereby a Fleet may be, for divers
days and weeks, very much ſeperated,
and yet gotten together again, that
hereupon, upon the firſt kenn, no
miſtakings may enſue, but that a far
off they may make themſelves known
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:56870:180"/>
one unto another, it is neceſſary that
ſome particular ſignal be ſpecified to
this purpoſe; the which may be, by
ſo many times putting out and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off ſome certain Flag, or by the
ſo often ſtriking of a Top-ſail or the
like; the which they are to anſwer
one another.</p>
                  <p>And to every one of theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
ſignals,<note place="margin">All Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals to be well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and looked after by all Ships in a Fleet.</note> diligent looking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is to be practiſed, and careful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to be given by every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Ship of the Fleet at all times,
that ſo they may fit and accommodate
themſelves one unto anothers Sailing
upon all occaſions, and thereby keep
themſelves together, and be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
prepared for all Services and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
                  <p>The due and ſtrict obſervation of
which particulars, howſoever it muſt
needs coſt and take up much time, in
point of a diſpatch, and haſte of a
Voyage, becauſe to a Fleet of Ships,
in keeping well together, there is to
be allowed even with the one and the
ſame Wind and Weather, well near
double the time that a ſingle Ship
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:56870:180"/>
hath; yet will it in a Fleet, make an
ample amends, in reſpect as well of a
general ſafety and preſervation, as all

                  <p>Rules of this Nature muſt be
expected various and different, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
as the chaſed lye from the
chaſer: For if the chaſed (being ſet
by the Compaſs) be found any thing
to the Windwards (and then it is of
leaſt hope) the Chaſer is to bring all
his Tacks aboard, and to ſhape his
courſe, to meet with her at the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Angle. If the chaſed be to the
Leewards, it is at the faireſt, for then
the chaſer may be in good hope to
ſpeak with her, unleſs ſhe bear up
right before the Wind, and ſo out ſail
her; or that ſhe bring herſelf cloſe by
a Wind, and the chaſer prove the
more Leeward Ship, and ſo loſe her
that way. If the chaſed be found
right a-head, and ſo the Chaſer be
put to a Stern-chaſe, the beſt ſailer
ſhall carry it, if there be Sea-room
and day-light enough,</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>The beſt way to come up

                  <p>It is beſt to order your Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to Shoot at her Sails, Yards,
Maſts and general Tackling, with as
many of your Great Guns as will be
brought to bear; and when you are
gotten up very near unto her, to lade

particulars being (as I ſay) before
the beginning of the fight duly fitted

executed, is to keep to the Windwards

may ariſe to your ſelf, by the ſmoak
of your own Ordnance and ſmall
Shot; but you ſhall alſo ſo annoy and
hinder the ſight of your Enemy, as
that he ſhall not be able to make any
certain ſhot at your ſelf again, nor
find the liberty of looking about, nor
be able to diſcover, and ſo make uſe
of any diſaſtrous accident that may
fall out to your hurt, and his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:

the Enemy beaten from aloft, and ſo
the Decks cleared that way: the next
care to be taken is, for the preventing
of all Trains, either to Powder Cheſts,

Cheſts whereſoever they ſhall be found;
or to any Barrels of Powder placed
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:56870:189"/>
under the Decks for the blowing of
them up; and this muſt be done, by
a ſpeedy breaking open of the Scutles
and Hatches, and the entring of your
Men between the Decks: And if, when
you are upon the inſtant of your firſt
entring, you ſhall perceive any Trains
of Powder in any part aloft upon the
Decks, before your farther entrance it
behoveth you to Fire them.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>One way of doing of it,<note place="margin">In all boardings Trains of Powder are to be taken heed of, and how theſe may be done.</note> and
a ſure way, may be by the fitting of
certain Pots of Earth, capable of two
or three Pounds of Powder, in each
of them; the which having lighted
Matches faſtned unto them, are to be
thrown upon theſe Trains, that ſo by
the breaking of the Pots, the lighted
Matches may fire the Powder, and the
Powder the Enemies Trains, whereby
not only that danger is avoided with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all damage to you ſelf, but a way
prepared alſo, for your own more eaſie
and ſafe acceſs entring your Men
in the very blind of that ſmoak. And
theſe Pots are alſo very proper and
uſeful, to be thrown into any part of a
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:56870:189"/>

is found to ſtand thick together,
and that as well to blind as ſpoil them;
and withal to procure to your ſelf the
better opportunity of entring your
Men.</p>
                  <p>And thus the Enemy being every
way ſtowed below the Decks, and
your Men in poſſeſſion of the Sails and

you may give what Quarter you pleaſe,

in cold Blood, nor cruel at any time.</p>

                  <p>Rules of this kind,<note place="margin">Fights of defence may be well made in Ships well fitted for them.</note> and to
this point muſt be fitted according as
the caſes and occaſions are that preſent
themſelves: For it is certain, and to
be ingeniouſly confeſſed, that if any
one ſhall find himſelf engaged, by, or
with an Enemy, evidently and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
over-topping him in Shipping
and Men, that it is the wiſeſt and
honeſteſt way of Defence, to clear
himſelf of his Company as ſpeedily as
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:56870:190"/>
he can, either by taking the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of out-ſailing of him, or by
ſtealing from him in the night, or the
like: For <hi>Non Hercules contra duos.</hi>
And ſome Commanders there have
been, that have honoured themſelves
as much by a Retreat as any others by
a Fight.</p>

                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>And yet I have heard that
ſome even of our own Merchant Men,
whereof ſome of them were ſingle,
and without the help and comfort of
any Conſort, have made very ſtout
and long Defenſive Fights, with two
or three Ships of Pirats at once, and
have at laſt eſcaped and got off, with
good reputation.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>I deny not, but that a well
built and well fitted Ship, (as ſome of
our Merchant Men are) being ſingle,
and Manned with ſome ſtout and well
reſolved Men, though not to the full,
yet being willing and active, may (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put unto it) do very much defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively,
againſt a far greater number,
that are neither forced to the fight, nor
have ſo good a quarrel. And indeed
rather than to do baſely, and yield diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorably
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:56870:190"/>
it becometh honeſt Men,
and true Soldiers to ſight it out to the
laſt Man, and to ſink ten times over
(if it were poſſible) in the Sea, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to give way to an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
ſubmiſſion: and it is true, that an
Enemy, though never ſo numerous,
may be made to buy his Conqueſt
dearly, from ſuch vowed Defendants,
ſo provided and Shipped, witneſs the
brave Revenge of that brave Ship the
Revenge of Queen <hi>Elizabeths,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by that brave and reſolute
<hi>Greenfeild:</hi> Nevertheleſs, as it were a
madneſs in this caſe to ſeek out ſuch
an Enemy (the which I dare be ſworn
our Merchant Men never did) ſo it
were a folly, if not a frenzie, to ſtay
longer amongſt them, than one muſt
needs; and not to diſengage ones ſelf,
from ſuch an inequallity, if it may
honorably and cautiouſly be attained.</p>

                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>I confeſs it to be ſo. But yet

Courſes for a Defenſive Fight, when

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Thoſe few ways that I know,<note place="margin">Some ways and Courſes to be uſed in Fights of Defence.</note>
may be by endeavoring and applying
your ſelf (in the firſt place) to preſerve
your Men: And this may be done, by
keeping of them cloſe in covert under
your Decks eſpecially when you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Enemies ſmall Shot, to be
ready and prepared to play upon them.
To which end alſo the Lids and Covers
of your Ports are carefully to be let
down, as often as any of your Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
make their Reverſe within
board, and at every thruſting of them
out; it is to be done with expedition,
and the Men that mannage them, are
warily to retire themſelves from before
the openings of the Ports. And for
the preſervation of your Men from the
Cannon, the beſt and moſt probable
way, that I can find, is, by the fitting
and ſtrongly Stanſhioning of your
mid Ship through out, with two
rows of Stanſhions made of Elme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plancks,
or the like Wood that will
not ſplinter: and theſe are to be of
four, or ſix Inches in thickneſs, and
of four or five Feet in diſtance one
from another; and the void place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:56870:191"/>
theſe two Rows, is to be ſtuffed
up with Juncks of Cables,<note place="margin">Courſes to preſerve <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſo ſuch of your Men, as are not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
to be employed about the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of your Ordnance, and
Sails, may retire themſelves behind that
ſide of this Barricado, which in a Fight
is moſt remote from the Enemies ſhot;
and hereby ſaveguard themſelves from
the violence of the great Shot, and
eſpecially from Croſs-bar and Chain-ſhot,
which is the chiefeſt ſpoil of
Men; and yet be ready enough, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
any occaſion ſhall require, either
for the entring of the Enemies Ship,
or the Defence of their own. And in
this manner you may maintain your
defenſive Fight, whilſt the Enemy
fighteth aloof, and boardeth you
not.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>If he board, and that your
Ship be one of thoſe three Deck't Ships
formerly deſcribed, you ſhall make
him repent it, by ſcouring your Decks
with your Ordnance laden with Caſe-ſhot,
and lodged in good Cover, and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:56870:192"/>
there well ſecured within your Bulk-heads,
under the half Deck and Fore-Caſtle;
as alſo by your ſmall Shot,
playing upon them thorough Loop-holes,
upon every part and piece of
your Ship aloft: ſo that the Enemy
will not be haſty to give any ſecond
charge upon you that way.</p>

                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>But how if your Ship be an

are, which otherwiſe would prove ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good and luſty Ships of War.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly (my Lord) there is no
other way in this caſe,<note place="margin">Courſes to keep off an over potent Enemy from boarding of your Ship.</note> to beat of an
Enemy that overtops you with Men
from a boarding, but when he is board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſtore of his Men, by blowing
up your Decks, with Barrels of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
placed under them. But then the
miſchief will be, that the Enemy find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you thus laid open, enters upon
you a ſecond time, and then there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be found any ſecond means to put
him off.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Adm.</speaker>
                  <p>But are there no Courſes to
keep off an Enemy from boarding of
you, when you find your ſelf to lye
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:56870:192"/>
thus open unto him, and that you are
too weak to grapple with him this
way?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Some ways there are, that
may ſerve to this purpoſe, though to
ſay truth, not much to be relied upon.
As one may be by bearing up from
him full afore the Wind, between
your two Sheats, and ſo keeping always
towards him, as he is ready to lay you
on board, not ſuffering him by any
means to come up with your ſide or
midſhip: And this may be done, as
long as you have Sea room, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
bearing up from him at all turns:
ſo that if he will needs enter upon
you, you ſhall force him to enter only
at your Stern, over your Ships Poop,
by cauſing of his Men to ſcale and
clamber up by his own Bolt-ſprit: The
which he will find ſo difficult to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
as well by reaſon of the heighth
of your Stern, as the Streightneſs and
ill way of his acceſs, that ten ſtout
Men of yours, may be ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
one hundred of his.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond means of avoiding of an
Enemies Boarding of you may be (if<note place="margin">Stratagems to avoid boardings.</note>
                     <pb n="378" facs="tcp:56870:193"/>
you chance to be in a Channel, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
where, where you may find Ground
by letting fall of an Anchor on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and ſo cauſing your own Ship to
come to a Riding, at the very point
when you find the Enemies Ship upon
a boarding of you; the which he not
at all ſuſpecting, nor being prepared to
do the like, it will certainly follow,
that the Tide (eſpecially if the Wind
and Tide happen to be all at one, or
that it be a calm) will ſo ſuddenly
carry him to the Leeward of you, as
that he ſhall not poſſibly be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
himſelf, nor to get to the Wind-wards
again, until the turning of the
Tide; in which interim your Retreat
may well be favoured, either by a
change of Wind, the meeting with ſome
friend, the darkneſs of a Night, or ſome
other good accident.</p>
                  <p>A third way to this purpoſe, may
be found aidful, by a quick raiſing of
ſome thick ſmoak or ſmoother in your
own Ship, as if it were accidentally on
fire, juſt as the Enemy is putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into the action of Boarding of
you; the which he perceiving, and
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:56870:193"/>
taking you to be on fire, may well be
ſcared from coming near unto you,
leaſt he ſhould burn with you himſelf:
In which blind alſo, you may well find
ſome convenient opportunity of wend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off from him, and by that means,
(at leaſt for the time) eſcape his hands.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are the ſureſt, and moſt
probable ways and Stratagems, that I
know, or have heard of, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
of being laid aboard by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
powerful Enemy. For as for that
trick and invention, that ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
of the launcing out the ends of
Maſts, or Yards, thorough the Ports
and other parts of a Ship, to keep off
an Enemy from a Boarding, I allow
but little of it; for it is only to be uſed
by the greater ſort of Ships, becauſe in
the leſſer, though they ſhould be of
an extraordinary ſtrength for their
ſize; yet the weight and heigth of the
ſtronger and taller Ships, muſt needs
force out the oppoſite ſides of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

But there is a main Point remaineth

from this (I know well) have
been found preſcribed and practiſed.
As for a Fleet, which conſiſteth but of
a few Ships, and being to fight in an
open Sea, that it ſhould be brought up
to the Battel in one only Front, with
the chief Admiral in the midſt of them;
and on each ſide of him the ſtrongeſt
and beſt provided Ships of the Fleet,
who keeping themſelves in as conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
a diſtance as they ſhall be able, are
to have an Eye and regard in the Fight,
to all the weaker and worſer Ships of
the party, and to relieve and ſuccour
them upon all occaſions; and withal,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:56870:196"/>
by being near the Admiral, may both
guard him, and aptly receive inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from him.</p>
                  <p>And for a numerous Fleet, they
propound, that it ſhould be ordered
alſo, (when there is Sea-room ſufficient)
into one only front; but that the ableſt
and moſt War-like Ships ſhould be ſo
ſtationed, as that the agillity of the
ſmaller Ships, and the ſtrength of the
other may be communicated to a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
relief, and for the better ſerving
in all occaſions, either of chaſe, or
charge: To which end they order,
that all the files of this front that are
to the Windwards, ſhould be made up
of the ſtrongeſt and beſt Ships, that ſo
they may the ſurer and ſpeedier relieve
all ſuch of the weaker Ships, being to
the Leewards of them, as ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered

be very diſadvantageous for them, and
the rather in reſpect that their Fleet
being great, muſt needs be ſubject to

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>For mine own part, I have
no great opinion of it: For firſt, this
cannot be done with any certainty,
but with a Fore-wind, or a quick cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
or Tide, ſetting in full upon the
Enemy: Secondly, theſe Fire-ſhips,
when they have both Wind and Tide,
muſt nevertheleſs be wafted with a
ſtrong Guard of Boats, cloſe up with
the Enemy, before they be fired and
forſaken by thoſe that have the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them on: for otherwiſe, it is
to be expected that the Enemies Boats
will eaſily tow them off, to the one
ſide or other, and ſo let them burn
themſelves unprofitably. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
though they be thoroughly and
luckily put on, yet may the Enemy
eaſily avoid the danger, by letting ſlip
only, or cutting of the Cables in the
Hawſes (when it comes to the worſt)
of ſuch Ships as lye in moſt danger,
as being in the way of their drift. In
which reſpects I do indeed hold them
to be very uncertain to be relied upon,
unleſs it be in ſome narrow of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
with the benefit and help of a
Wind and Current, where the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:56870:198"/>
cannot enlarge himſelf any way,
nor tow off theſe Fire-ſhips with their
Boats, to any ſide clear of themſelves, by
reaſon of the ſtreightneſs of the Place.</p>
                  <p>It is true,<note place="margin">Fire Ships how to be uſed and employed by way of ſtratagem.</note> that in another kind, and
by way of a ſtratagem, this kind of
Fire-ſhips, may hapily be found of
good proof; it being trimmed up to
look like Ships of War, they ſhall be
well fitted with combuſtible matter,
and ſo (at the inſtant of a Fight) be
put out in the very front, as if it were
with an intent to give an onſet and to
encounter with the forwardeſt and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt
Ships, of the Enemy; that ſo
having drawn them on to a Fight, and
(as it may hit) to a grappling, they
may then ſuddenly ſet themſelves on
fire (their Men ſaving themſelves in
their Boats) and ſo with the furious
burning of themſelves, hazard the
ſpoil and firing of all ſuch Ships of
the Enemies as ſhall be either faſt grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
with them, or aboard them, or
near unto them: This (I ſay) may
hapily be produced, when theſe Fire-ſhips,
are miſtaken for Men of War;
but when known, and expected as
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:56870:199"/>
Fire-ſhips, they carry but ſmall hope
of ſucceſs with them, thorough the
reaſons aforeſaid.</p>

which you mentioned even now, that

                  <p>It is true, but your Lordſhip
may remember withal that it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thorough their own falſe fear than
any true cauſe: For theſe Fire-Ships
being thruſt upon them in the dark of
the night, inſtead of ordinary Fire-Ships
(as indeed they were) they were
thought by the Enemy, to be of thoſe
kind of dreadful Powder Ships, which
that famous <hi>Enginier Frederick Innibell,</hi>
had deviſed not long before (and ſome
of them had felt to their coſt) in the
River of <hi>Skeld;</hi> whereupon crying
out <hi>the Fire Antwerp,</hi> that forreſt off
Ships and vaſt Gallions, tumultuouſly
cut their Cables in their Hawſes, and

                  <p>Indeed I believe,<note place="margin">Mine (ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as) Powder Ships hard to be made uſe of and employed.</note> that Ships
ſtuffed with Powder, hadded in ſtrong

work Deviliſh effects, upon all things

how to bring them up to the Places

and how to prevent preventions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

for if it be upon an Enemies Coaſt and
in caſe of defence, the beſt courſe (in
mine opinion) is if theſe Ships expect
to be aſſaulted by a Fleet coming out
of the Sea, to bring themſelves to an
Anchor, where they may receive leaſt
harm and dammage from the ſhore;
and if it fall out ſo ill, that any part of
the Fleet (by being forced to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,
or to paſs by within reach of any
Fort of the Enemies on the Shore) find
it ſelf in danger that way; it may be
provided for, by cauſing ſome few of
the worſt and oldeſt Ships amongſt
them, to run themſelves on ground
right in the face of the Enemies Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
with all their Sails ſtanding,
that ſo with their Hulls and Sails, they
may both ſhadow, and ſerve as a Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,

Fleet in their paſſing by: And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

done, the reſt of the Fleet are to
birth themſelves at as near a diſtance
one unto another as conveniently they
may, the better to relieve one another
upon all occaſions, ordering that ſuch
Ships as are of moſt defence and
ſtrength, either in reſpect of Ordnance
or ſtrength otherwiſe, be placed fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and foremoſt in the ways of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
Fleets approach, and there do
attend the firſt aſſault, having beſides
ſome of the lighteſt Ships and beſt ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
continually abroad in the Offin, to

approach, and to make fit diſcoveries.</p>

your guard,<note place="margin">The beſt Form and Courſes for a Fleet to defend it ſelf being aſſaulted by an Enemy in a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that is to freind.</note> the moſt provident and
ſafe way is, to bring the Sterns of
your Ships as near unto the Shore as
poſſibly you may; yea, ſo near as that,
if the Shore be Oazie Ground, they
may ſew at low Water mark; for
hereby the aſſaulting Enemy, be he
never ſo numerous, will be made fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and wary in his approaches upon
you for fear of running himſelf on
Ground; and this the rather, if your
Ships ſhall be anchored ſo cloſe one

may paſs from one Ship to another;
and that ſome Ordnance be fittly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
upon the Shore to ſuccour and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
them: But withal a main provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is to be made of Long-boats,

                  <p>You have ſaid well, touching

                  <p>They ſhould be of thoſe
ſorts,<note place="margin">What Ships of War are fitteſt to be employed in this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault.</note> as are moſt floaty, that ſo they
may the nearer come up with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
but yet to be ſtrong, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provided with good and great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
a choice number of which
Ships are to bring themſelves in order,
to an Anchor as near as they can flote
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:56870:204"/>
at low Water mark, unto the Enemies
Ships, and there to moore themſelves
in that manner, as that their Broad-ſides
may beat upon the Enemy, and
are there to lye continually beating
upon them, with as many of their
great Guns, as may be brought to
bear. By which Courſe, (being ſo
near unto them, and having of them ſo
fair a mark, by their being ſo cloſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as that few of their great ſhot
will be given in vain) it is very prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that either they ſhall ſink them
where they ride, or force them to
cut their Cables, and ſo be ruined by
driving upon the Shore. And in Caſe,
that any of theſe aſſaulting Ships
ſhould receive any great ſhot from the
Enemy, endangering her ſinking, ſhe
is to retreat into the main body of the
Fleet, and ſome other to be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to make good her place.</p>
                  <p>And the better to ſecure them from
the Enemies Shallops and Boats, which
may deſperately attempt to fire them
or cut their Cables, they are to have
all their Great Guns on their Weather
ſides, or on that which is fartheſt from
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:56870:204"/>
the Enemy, to be continually laden
with murthering ſhot, to play upon
their approaches, and their Boats to be
well Manned and lye on the ſame ſide,
that ſo they may be ready to receive
them every way. Neither can theſe
aſſailing Ships, thus lying at an Anchor
be much endangered by the Enemies
Cannon, if any ſhould be lodged on
the Shore, becauſe that lying and being
anchored ſo cloſe up with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Ships they muſt needs ſerve
them as a good defence and Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
by their Riding directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their own Cannon on the Shore
and them; ſo that they cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy
them without endammaging

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Theſe (in my opinion) are
to be brought on in the dark of a
night (the lying and Riding of the
Enemies Ships from you,<note place="margin">How Mine or Powder Ships may be employed in this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault.</note> being ſet by
the Compaſs in the day-time) and are
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:56870:205"/>
to be conducted (though with as
much ſilence as may be) by good
ſtore of Boats to ſuch a diſtance from
the Enemies Fleet, as that their Men
that Man them, may find time and
place to retire themſelves out of the
reach and ſpoil of their firing, and
that theſe Ships nevertheleſs (by
having all their Sails abroad and their
Rudders well wedged, and ſo ſetting
in with a fore Wind, and if it may be
with a Tide alſo) may of themſelves,
in all likelyhood fall in with the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of the Enemies Ships, to a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
execution. And becauſe it is
to be expected, that upon their Mens
leaving of them, this ſhall be no
ſooner perceived by the Enemy, but
that ſome will adventure to board
them, and by a ſpeedy ſearching out
for their Trains, ſeek to prevent
their firing; it is a good way that
many falſe Trains and Matches be
lay'd and beſtowed in ſundry places
of thoſe Ships; the which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
finding and removing, may be
deluded by a ſuppoſed prevention,
and ſo give over a more narrow
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:56870:205"/>
ſearch: And for the true Trains, that
all ſuch Matches as are prepared for
them be made faſt to long Twines
or Packthreds, the other ends of
which Packthreds, are to be tied to
the ſeers of two or three Piſtols,
whoſe Fire-locks are to be ready
bent, and the Piſtols being charged
with Powder are ſo to be laid with
their mouths, as that being fired by
the ſnatching up of the Matches faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the Packthreds tied to their
ſeers, they may by ſhooting into the
main Bed of Powder, lay'd within
the Vault or Chamber of the Mine,
be ſure to fire it, or at leaſt, if theſe
Matches ſhall not be found at all by
the Enemies, that then they may of
themſelves in their due time, give fire to
the true Trains; that ſo either by the
one means or the other, the wiſh'd ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effect
of the blowing up of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Ships, and the Enemy with them,
may be accompliſhed.</p>
