         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Honoured Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce my laſt Letter was ſo happy as to pleaſe more of
the Party than my firſt Offended, and that even thoſe
are ſomewhat ſoftened by it, I prevail'd with my ſelf,
once more, to give you my thoughts upon the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
And though I think the Objections you have ſent me,
are come too far for an Anſwer, yet I will give you mine, with
all the plainneſs, brevity and temper I can; for they that
ſeek the publick good, are not to be nice in their endeavours
for it; and ſuch who go upon Principles, have the advantage of
being ſecured by their Sincerity, even where their miſtakes
cannot be defended. But as I think I am not in the wrong, ſo
I ſincerely profeſs, if I knew I were, no temporal conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould engage me againſt my Opinion; for though I am
for the Liberty of perſuing ones own Judgment, I abhor the
Latitude of Diſſembling it. But to the point before us.</p>
            <p>You tell me, that the generality of the Sobereſt and Wiſeſt
of thoſe, that would be eſteemed Members of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> of your Acquaintance, do declare, <hi>They have no
Averſion for Liberty of Conſcience, and that they always liked
an Indulgence to Diſſenters, but they are angry at the preſent
manner of it, and with the Addreſſes of Thanks the Diſſenters
have made to the King for It.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſay nothing then of who they were that made the <hi>Penal
Laws,</hi> or by whom they were Executed, or upon what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;
and leſs, what Prejudices thereby have followed to the
Perſons and Eſtates of Thouſands of the Kings Subjects (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that Hiſtory might look harſh, and I reſolve to be as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55852:3"/>
healing as I can) Let me ask, why theſe Gentlemen ſhould be
offended at the way of the Eaſe the King has graciouſly given?
'Tis certain, that ſome of them reproach'd the ſevere Conduct
he has chang'd, and thought it ill in the Government to expoſe
ſo many uſeful Men in their Perſons and Eſtates to a pack of
lewd Informers, that yet now quarrel the ſtop he has given to
thoſe ſeverities. They will, I hope, pardon me if I ſay; Chriſt's
Anſwer to the <hi>Phariſees</hi> about the breach of the Sabboth came
in my mind upon reading their Objection, <hi>What man among you
that ſhould have a Sheep fall into a Pit on the Sabboth day, will,
not lay hold on it and lift it out?</hi> He excuſed <hi>David</hi> and the Prieſts
in a Caſe of the like nature, and thought a good deed was to
be done at any time, when he healed the poor man. This
was he that preferred Mercy before Sacrifice, and exalted the
good Nature of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> above the ſtrict <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite,</hi>
that with all their Reverence to the Law, left the Rifled
and Wounded unregarded. But to turn the ſtile of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
Why ſhould any of the Church of <hi>England</hi> be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
when it is a <hi>leſs Power</hi> than has been publickly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the moſt venerable of their <hi>own Clergy,</hi> in all times
ſince the <hi>Reformation?</hi> You will find <hi>Arch-Biſhop Whitgift,</hi> in his
Letter to Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> aſſerting her Power in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
to reſt wholly and abſolutely in the <hi>Queen,</hi> &amp; that he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
her, by no means to allow the <hi>Parliament</hi> to have the finge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of thoſe things; and that what Cannons were made by the
Clergy in <hi>Convocation,</hi> by her Majeſties Authority, might be
OBSERVED or ALTERED at HER PLEASURE.</p>
            <p>And in another Letter to the Lords of the Council, he
tells them, that the <hi>Queen</hi> her own ſelf, had in expreſs Words,
immediately committed Cauſes <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> to him, as to one,
who was to make Anſwer to <hi>God</hi> and her <hi>Majeſty</hi> in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
and not to their Lordſhips, wherein, as he ſuppoſed, he
had no Judge but her ſelf. Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and Biſhop
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55852:3"/>
               <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> Dr <hi>Heylin,</hi> Dr <hi>Hicks</hi> and ſeveral other <hi>dignified
Divines</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> all grave and learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
follow the ſame Sentiments touching <hi>Regal Power,</hi> in a
more extended manner, as you may ſhortly ſee by an <hi>Ingenious
hand,</hi> who hath exactly Tranſcribed their own <hi>Writings</hi> in
this great <hi>Point.</hi> But in general, it is reſolved by Dr <hi>Starky,</hi> in
his Aſſiſe Sermon at St <hi>Edmonds-Bury,</hi> concerning the divine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of human Ordinances, Printed by <hi>John Field,</hi> Printer
to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> 1668. That Conſtitutions, as
<q>they had their Original and Eſtabliſhment from the Reaſon of
the ſupream Magiſtrate, conſulting for the conveniency and
good of the Society, ſo the condition of things and State alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
upon their Burthen and Inconvenience, may, by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
that eſtabliſhed them, be <hi>altered, ſuſpended, abrogated,</hi>
and taken quite away.</q> Thus a Divine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
but to proceed on that Leſſon, <hi>argumentum ad hominem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>For what greater Injury (ſaith he) canſt thou put upon thy
careful Governour, then when his <hi>Contrivances</hi> and <hi>Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi>
are publiſhed for <hi>publick good,</hi> that his Directions ſhould
be Contemned, and by thy <hi>Rebellion</hi> that thou ſhouldſt ſuggeſt
to others (what our diſorderly nature is too ready to ſuſpect)
that their <hi>Rules</hi> are the <hi>Reſults of erronious and corrupt men,</hi>
which ought to be lookt upon as the <hi>determinations of ſacred
Authority derived from a moſt wiſe and juſt God.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But if this were not ſo, is it the ſame thing to diſpence with
a Temporary, as a fundamental Law? With that which
ſays, <hi>thou ſhalt not go to a Conventicle,</hi> as with that which
ſays, <hi>thou ſhalt not Kill or Steal?</hi> are there not ſome Laws
that are of that moral and enduring nature, no time or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
of State can Diſpenſe with? and ſuch Laws as are ſo
ſpecially accommodated, that the reaſon of them may not live
three Years to an end? The Penal Laws about Religion were
made for fear that divers Opinions in one Country might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55852:4"/>
the Government, &amp; time ſhows us that nothing hazards
it more then their execution. Tis plain it puts us in a ſtate
of force, and that therefore People fly the Kingdom, and
Trade dwindles to nothing: And ſince all Countrys are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by their People and forraign Commerce, than by their
Soyle and Domeſtick Labour and Conſumption, whatever
leſſens them, impoveriſhes and weakens the Kingdom. Who
will Trade where his gettings are none of his own? or live,
where he is not ſure of his Principle? Which is the Caſe of
Diſſenters in a Country uſing coertion for Religion. And
when all this is ſaid, the King is pleaſed to refer the matter
to the concurrence of a Parliament, and ſuch Power for the
good of the Publick, was never denied by any man of ſence, any
where, to the wiſdom and neceſſity of Government, and It muſt
ever reſt with that part of it, which is by the Conſtitution al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in the way, which, we all know, our Parliaments are not.</p>
            <p>This Declaration ſeems to me no more than a <hi>Royal Bill
without Doors,</hi> informing the Kingdom of his Majeſties
mind, and preparing both Houſes to make it the Subject of
their next Seſſion: And I don't think I ſhall ever ſee a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>England</hi> break with a King of his Juſtice and Valour,
upon ſo reaſonable and popular a Point.</p>
            <p>But to be free, it looks ill in any of the Sons of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> to Scandal this eaſe with the irregularity of the
way of it, when nothing is more evident than that they cannot
do it without flying in the face of that Loyalty, which made
that Church ſo famous in 41. For as then the Diſtinction of the
<hi>Natural and Political capacity of the King,</hi> was the great
Doctrine of the Parliament againſt ſeveral Acts of State,
which in part, gave riſe to the miſunderſtandings and Wars
that followed. So 'tis certain, that the Generality of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> oppoſed it as a pernitious Principle to the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
and rather than ſuffer ſo Plebean a notion to take place in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55852:4"/>
the Government, drew their Swords for the Soveraignty of
the Crown; and we all know what endeavours have been
uſed, and by whom, ſince the late Kings Reſtoration, to Damn
that diſtinction as the very ſeed of Rebellion.</p>
            <p>This Reflection makes me beſeech the diſſatisfied Sons of
the Church to Conſider, how much wiſer it were to approach
the King with all poſſible Candour and Decency, and by
aſſuring him, that their concern looks no further, than ſuch
a Legal and uncoercive ſecurity for themſelves, as at the ſame
time that others are ſafe from them, by the repeal of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Laws, the Church may be ſecure that no one of thoſe
intereſts ſhall invade her Rights and Poſſeſſions, he may be
induced to imbrace the <hi>Mediums</hi> that in ſuch an occaſion it
were the eaſieſt thing in the World to find, as well as that
they might be the moſt agreeable and honorable in themſelves
for all our happineſſes. Let her then betake her ſelf to think
of ſome happy expedients, and rebuke thoſe Members of her
Communion, that run up and down with the falſeſt, as well as
angrieſt aggravations; that we may all yet meet in ſome
general and national Principle to adjuſt our ſeveral Intereſts
upon.</p>
            <p>For can ſhe take it ill of the King, that he receives the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
as near him for his intereſt, as 'tis plain ſhe would take
them to her for her ſecurity? the Objection ſhe makes againſt
their former Diſloyalty, vaniſheth with their <hi>preſent Adherence
and her Diſſent;</hi> for it both ſhows they are for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
when that is for them, and that even ſhe her ſelf is for
it no longer; nay, it will be ſaid by ſome, nor ſo long; for
ſhe is (ſay they) not ſatisfied <hi>to be ſafe, nor yet to keep the
Chair,</hi> nor will ſhe <hi>thank the King for that,</hi> unleſs others
may be confounded that cannot <hi>offer at her Altar;</hi> who, as
bad as they are, for this Gracious Reprieve, think him not
only worthy of their thanks, but of their <hi>Eſtates and Lives</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:55852:5"/>
when he wants them on ſo glorious an occaſion: And it is not
the fooliſheſt thought that may come in her head, that having
once loſt the King to the ſide againſt which ſhe could not
maintain his Father, her caſe muſt be deſperate upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
which God forbid.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, when I conſider the <hi>Idea</hi> we have been taught to
have of a Popiſh King, and what <hi>Perſecuting, Maſſacring
Murdering</hi> work was neceſſarily to attend his Raign, I cannot
but ſay, I think the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſecurer, in this Raign,
upon the Kings Declaration, than any other worldly ſupport
ſhe can flatter her ſelf with; and not to thank him, for an
aſſurance ſhe deſir'd, and that is ſo generouſly given for a King
of his circumſtances, from whom, we were told worſe things
would have followed, and then too, when too many of her
Children would indiſcreetly have provok'd other reſolutions,
ſhows her leſs Chriſtian and civil then I believe ſhe deſires to
be thought, and I hope, upon the main, ſhe deſerves.</p>
            <p>But you tell me, that this liberty is by divers perſons rendered
dangerous to the Monarchy, <hi>in that it ſtrengthens the hands of
thoſe People that have always been for a Common-wealth:</hi> This looks
very kind and dutiful to the Royal Family: But tho no body
more affectionately wiſhes the preſervation and juſt ſucceſſion
of it than my ſelf, I can't forbear to charge the Objection wit
extream weakneſs, for it is remov'd with a word; <hi>the King
has an Army,</hi> Is that the way to ſet it up? And what
he leaves, his Children will finde. Is the love of Power
firſt objected, and then a deſign to make a Common-Wealth
with it? But they will ſay, tho it ben't his deſign, <hi>it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent</hi>
upon his meaſures. But I muſt tell them, no ſtory
ſhows us, that ever any Government was changed,
making the People of it eaſie; but often t'other way: Nor is
it to be thought, that folks will Plot to looſe, what they might
be driven to Plot to get. Let the Church think as hardly of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55852:5"/>
Diſſenters as ſhe will; they cannot be any longer in pain
when they are made eaſie. Beſides, what have they further
to ſeek, or which way can they poſſibly agree it? While their
Conſcience and Property are ſafe, they have no more to ask,
and no body was ever againſt that, which is for them; nor
any Government indanger'd by the People it ſeeks to preſerve.
The King has begun to ſhow his inclinations to make us all
eaſie &amp; ſafe, and it will be her fault if we are not ſo, quickly and
intirely. This is the way to prevent the miſchiefs ſhe fears;
and what ſhe would have done in their caſe, to have prov'd
her ſelf a better Chriſtian or a better Subject I can't tell. But
'tis certain that the Church, by the power of the Monarchy,
endeavour'd their ruin: That they fell in with that ſide that
favoured their releif, is as true: Were it not better that
'twere out of the power of both to do the ſame thing over
again? one to engage the Crown, and t'other to oppoſe it, for
t'other Worlds matters? Doubtleſs it were, and this Liberty
muſt be the way.</p>
            <p>Thoſe times, I am ſure, have a double inſtruction to the
preſent Church of <hi>England;</hi> One, that ſhe be not too ſtiff
againſt a reaſonable Accomodation; the Other, that to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
her ſelf in it, ſhe falls not into the inconveniencies ſhe
has objected againſt the Diſſenters, whileſt under far leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
if any at all. Let her remember, 'twas her cauſe
that firſt engaged the Kings Father, and by conſequence, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
his Brother, and nothing elſe but this Kings tenderneſs,
leaſt he ſhould be too early with her in Declaring for Liberty
of Conſcience, when he came to the Crown, gave opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
for the late Weſtern Rebellion: For as he hath well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in his Speech to the Council, how much the want of it
went to promote our civil Wars, ſo 'tis certain, that had he
declared for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> when he told us of his
Religion, there had been no Rebellion in the Weſt: But the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55852:6"/>
miſ-guided <hi>Duke of Monmouth</hi> might have had his ſhare at
<hi>Buda,</hi> and the unhappy People of his train been alive at their
Vocations. And if this delay was not for want of an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Liberty of Conſcience was a juſt, neceſſary and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
thing, <hi>but his regard to the Church of England,</hi> that had
ſerv'd him well, and might not preſently take it the right way,
or be prepared to fall in with him upon that intereſt, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the higheſt proof how greatly he valued her concurrance,
and deſir'd to rely upon her Duty, Service and Friendſhip,
and conſequently, how much ſhe is obliged to his goodneſs, and
thoſe of her Sons are in the wrong, that carry a preſent diſtance
and coldneſs to his Adminiſtration. And when all is done,
the King in this very point has but perſued the ſenſe of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
very freely choſen; for in that laſt <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
when the Houſe of Commons apprehended their
Diſſolution, and that the black Rod was near the door to
that purpoſe, they came to ſeveral Dying Votes, as a Legacy
of their Averſion to the Court, and their Court to the King,
dom, among which, this was not the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Reſolv'd,</p>
            <p>
               <q>That it is the Opinion of this Houſe, that the Proſecution
of Proteſtant Diſſenters, upon the Penal Laws, is at this time
grievous to the Subject, a weaking of the Proteſtant Intereſt,
an Encouragement to Popery, and dangerous to the Peace of
the Kingdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If the heat of thoſe times could have left thoſe two angry
words out, it had carried the general Liberty now deſired, and
nothing would have hindred it in a time like this, with ſuch a
Parliament as that. For in the Raign of a King of a Popiſh
Religion, that we laboured ſo much to Diſappoint, to
deſire no more at our hands, after our fears of ſo much more
than a meer Liberty of Conſcience, indifferently fixed to all
Diſſenters, is ſuch a Cure of our Fears, and an Aſſurance of all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55852:6"/>
we can wiſh, that, we muſt be wanting to our ſelves in Wit,
as well as to the King in Gratitude, if we reject the motion.
Let her therefore be confident nothing excluded the Papiſts
then, but our Apprehentions <hi>that they ſtrove for all at our
Coſt;</hi> and if we are offer'd to be ſecur'd againſt ſuch Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies,
a Parliament ſo Choſen, would naturally compriſe
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you tell me, that two things ſtick yet with Divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of that Church: One,</hi> That it is not reaſonable the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
ſhould expect that they ſhould pluck the Thorn out of their
foot to put it in their own. <hi>The other,</hi> That in caſe the Penal
Laws and Teſts were removed by this Church-Parliament, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
might be packt that might turn both Laws and Teſt upon th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
preſent Church.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, tis granted then, that the Laws are a
<hi>Thorn</hi> in the Foot of the Diſſenters. Is it not as juſt to think
it ought to be pluck't out, and if the Church of <hi>England</hi> will
do nothing towards it, are they not excuſable that endeavour
it themſelves? Tho when one enquires, firſt, who put the
<hi>Thorn</hi> in, and next, that there is no neceſſity that ſhe muſt
put it into her own Foot, becauſe ſhe plucks it out of theirs;
it ſhould not be ſo hard to perſwade her to pluck it out, and
in my Opinion, it ſhould be as eaſie to fling it away, that it may
trouble no body elſe for the future. But that perhaps ſhe thinks
is not poſſible to be done, and that impoſſibility is given for
the reaſon, why ſhe chuſes to leave it where it is; which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
introduces my Anſwer to the ſecond Objection viz.
<hi>That if the Penal Laws and Teſts were remov'd by this Church
Parliament, another might be packt which might turn both Laws and
Teſts upon the preſent Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my laſt Letter, ſaid ſomething, that ought in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to ſatisfie the moſt jealous in this particular: For <hi>firſt,</hi> all
agree it is impoſſible to Repeal the Laws and Teſts without a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55852:7"/>
Parliament. <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'tis not to be thought that the preſent
Parliament will do it, without ſuch a Proviſion as will ſecure
us in the Point feared. To ſay there is none, is ridiculous;
for who can tell, what they may think upon, or from other
heads, what may occur to them? If they won't Repeal them,
let us ſuppoſe an other Parliament, as freely Choſen at leaſt;
can we imagin that ſuch a Repreſentative will be leſs careful
to ſecure us againſt our fears, tho they were more inclinable to
aboliſh thoſe Laws? If then both are like to go together, be
it by the preſent, or another Parliament, I ſee no inſecurity
that is like to follow, either to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or her
<hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters,</hi> who in that reſpect, are equally concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
with her ſelf.</p>
            <p>And for packing of a Parliament, if that were the buſineſs
and Deſign at laſt; why is it not attempted at firſt? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is ſo eaſie to be done, that if the King did not ſeek a more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable,
and laſting ſecurity to his Friends, to wit, a <hi>National</hi>
one, there are men enough of no Religion to be packt to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
that would firſt conform to the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſts,</hi> and then
mercenarily take them away. I know there are ſilly People
of all Parties, for whom no body can anſwer; but, tis aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing,
that ſuch a jealouſie ſhould have ſo much room with
men of any ſhare of ſenſe, <hi>that if this Parliament ſhould Repeal
the Laws and Teſts, the Papiſts in the next, would come into
Parliament, and then make their Religion National</hi> at our
charges. For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> it ſuppoſes no other expedient, which
is eaſie to be found and obtain'd, or let the other remain.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> it ſuppoſes that Roman Catholicks will be choſen,
or return'd, tho they are not choſen; The one 'tis certain we
don't fear, and methinks they only ſhould be afraid of the other;
for ſince they cannot be their own ſecurity, and this they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
by ſeeking a National one; If the firſt would do, why
don't they begin upon it, and pack a Parliament preſently,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55852:7"/>
and Repeal the Laws and Teſts without any more to do? And
if they don't do this, not becauſe they can't think upon it, but
becauſe they don't think it worth trying, why ſhould they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
by ſuch a way an harder thing? for no body would take
it ſo ill of them to Repeal the Laws that vex them by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct
way, as they would if they went about to make their
Religion National by it, and if they think it not aſſuring
enough for the leſſer, can they be tempted to imbrace it for
effecting of the greater point.</p>
            <p>Some of them have read the Hiſtories of their own Country,
and can't but remember, that in times, even of their own Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Parliaments ill Choſen came to ill Ends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the twenty firſt of</hi> Richard <hi>the ſecond Repeal'd the Acts
of the Parliament of the eleven of the ſame King; and that the
firſt of</hi> Henry <hi>the fourth, Repealed the twenty firſt of</hi> Richard <hi>the
ſecond: And that the thirty ninth of</hi> Henry <hi>the ſixth, Repealed the
Laws of the 38th of the ſame King, &amp; Damn'd that Parliament,
becauſe VNDULY Elected;</hi> which is the <hi>packing</hi> meant
in the Objection: So that 'tis not worth while to attempt it. If
ſuch a Parliament could be Immortal, or were able to Charm
ſucceſſive Raigns, or were not a violation of the Conſtitution of
Parliaments, and of one of the tendereſt points in our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or did not break faith with mankind, when moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to make a ſtraight ſtep, and by all this, <hi>treaſure up wrath
againſt the day of wrath upon the whole Party,</hi> which muſt dawn
at the ſetting of our preſent King, it were ſomething: but
when all this will follow, as certain as the Night does the Day,
To break all bounds of Law, and go by open Force, were an
honeſt and wiſe thing to ſuch a wooden Invention of Law, as
this would be to all men living of common ſence, and to the
Ages that ſhall follow us, who of right, will have the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
of our Actions. What then is left us, but to embrace
this Gracious tender, and all Parties to meet the King in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55852:8"/>
thoſe methods, that are moſt likely to eſtabliſh it with the
greateſt, ſatisfaction and certainty?</p>
            <p>If no other ſecurity can be had, I ſay then, let this that is,
remain, if there may be ſuch a thing, why ſhould we not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it? The Church of <hi>England</hi> diſclaims Severity and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
then let her part with thoſe Inſtruments of both, and
not ſuſpect the ſhaking of the Laws of Property, for ſtopping
the execution of the Laws <hi>that undermine it.</hi> I leave one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
with her, and ſo ſhall leave you at this time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let
nothing that is <hi>Vnfair,</hi> or <hi>Indirect</hi> lie at her Door, I beg her,
for Gods ſake. Ought ſhe to differ thus with any body? and leſs
with ſuch a King, upon a point ſhe cannot maintain, and that
is better left then kept, take the Queſtion, either as to <hi>Right</hi> or
<hi>Prudence?</hi> I will not be very particular, but enough to make
way for a fuller diſcourſe on the Subject.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Teſts,</hi> the chief, if not the only thing in debate, have they
any Foundation in our Conſtitution? Should a Mans being of
any Religion, hinder him from ſerving the Country of his
Birth? Does his going to a Conventicle naturally unqualifie
him for a Conſtables Staff? or believing Tranſubſtantiation,
render him uncapable of being a good Clark? It were as reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to ſay, that 'tis impoſſible for a Phanatick to be a good
Shoomaker, or a Papiſt a good Tayler. The very Notion is
Comical, And that muſt ever be the Conſequence of going out
of the way, and ſerving the Publick with ſuch a Byaſs to a
Party, for that is the ſofteſt way of ſpeaking of the Error.</p>
            <p>But when we conſider the Teſt in Relation to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where the Objection lies ſtrongeſt againſt the Repeal,
it appears not one jot leſs unreaſonable to continue it: For an
Opinion of Religion is made to deprive a <hi>Peer</hi> of the higheſt
Right of his Peerage: True, he is not totally Deſtroyed, but
he's Gelt of his chiefeſt Priviledge. For tho he looſes not his
Title, he has little elſe left him, Can the Peers of <hi>England</hi> to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55852:8"/>
ſerve a turn, ſo mutely ſuffer a Preſident to continue, that ſhakes
their hereditary ſhare in the Government, and ſo eſſential a
part of our ancient &amp; celebrate Conſtitution, and by which 'tis
made impoſſible to have an unconcerned Houſe in Judgment?
Let us but look back to <hi>Seventy Five,</hi> and ſee what was
done then, by divers Lords, in a caſe of this nature; I will
but repeat the <hi>Teſt</hi> and their <hi>Proteſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I A. B. do declare, That it is not Lawfull, upon any pretence
whatſoever, to take up Armes againſt the King, and that I do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
that Trayterous Poſition of taking Arms by His Authority
againſt His Perſon, or againſt thoſe that are commiſſion'd by Him
in purſuance of ſuch Commiſſion; And I do ſwear that I will not
at any time endeavour the Alteration of the Government, either
in Church or State, ſo help me God.</p>
            <p>The debate laſted Five ſeveral days before it was committed
to a Committee of the whole Houſe, which hardly ever happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to any Bill before: The Debates, were managed chiefly
by the Lords, whole Names you will find to the following
<hi>Proteſtation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We whoſe Names are under Written being Peers of this Realm,
do according to our Rights and the ancient Vſage of <hi>Parliaments,</hi>
declare that the Queſtion having been put, whether the Bill (entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
an Act to prevent the danger which may ariſe from Perſons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>afftected
to the Government) doth ſo far intrench upon the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of This Houſe; that it ought therefore to be caſt out. It
being reſolved in the Negative, We do humbly conceive that any
Bill which impoſeth an Oath upon the <hi>Peers</hi> with a Penalty, as this
doth that upon the refuſal of that Oath, <hi>They ſhall</hi> be made uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Sitting and Voting in this <hi>Houſe,</hi> as it is a thing unpreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented
in former Times, ſo is it, in Our. humble Opinion, THE
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55852:9"/>
HIGHEST INVASION OF THE LIBER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIES
AND PRIVILEDGES OF THE
PEERAGE, that poſſibly may be, and moſt deſtructive of
the Freedom, which they ought to enjoy as Members of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
becauſe the Priviledge of Sitting and Voting in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
is an Honor they have BY BIRTH, and a Right ſo
INHERANT IN THEM, AND INSEPARA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE
FROM THEM, AS THAT NOTHING
CAN TAKE IT AWAY, but what by the Law of the
Land, muſt withal, take away their Lives, and corrupt <hi>their Blood;</hi>
upon which ground we do here enter our Diſſent from that Vote,
and our Proteſtation againſt it.</p>

            <p>To ſay nothing here of the matter of the <hi>Teſt,</hi> 'tis plain

that depriv'd Peers of this fundamental Right of Peerage, and
that nothing could, in their opinion, do it, but ſuch crimes as
tainted their Blood and took away their lives. I know not if
thoſe living are ſtill of that minde, but the honour I have for
their Underſtanding and Integrity forbid me to doubt it.</p>
            <p>Now pray Suffer me to turn the Tables, and ask our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
one Queſtion in the Language of their Fears; Can the
King <hi>makes Lords,</hi> and <hi>pack an Houſe of Commons,</hi> that ſhall
firſt take, and then aboliſh the <hi>Teſt?</hi> Why then, it is not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55852:9"/>
ſo great a ſecurity as they imagin; and it is hardly worth
while to be ſo ſtiff to ſupport it. But by the ſame reaſon that
they can Repeal this, they may Enact another, and if ſo, may
not the Houſe of Peers be quickly another <hi>ſet</hi> of Men? For
that Fire that Roſts a Gooſe can Roſt a Gander. What <hi>Tides</hi>
are theſe in Government? and what State is ſafe, or happy,
whoſe Foundations <hi>float</hi> upon ſuch movable meaſures? Beſides,
the <hi>Lords</hi> intended to be made the example of our Power in this
affair, were generally obſerved to be ſome of the ſteadieſt
and beſt Voters upon all Queſtions that concern'd our Publick
Right.</p>
            <p>I have done with this. T'other part of my Conſideration
is the other part of our Parliament, the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> I
mean.</p>
            <p>And here we are taught to believe, <hi>the Peoples choice is the
Repreſentatives Authority;</hi> and if that be true, it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
hard to imagine which way they can hinder a man from
<hi>Seſſion</hi> that the People have freely choſen. I grant, that where
Competitors have made an Election diſputable, the final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is in the Repreſentative Body; but I cannot comprehend
how that Houſe can ever make void an undiſputed Election,
and ſuch is a free choice of the People, of any County or
Borrough; and yet that is the very buſineſs of the <hi>Teſt</hi> of
<hi>Seventy Eight.</hi> For if I believe the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi>
I cannot poſſibly fit in Parliament, let my Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Ability, Integrity be what they will. In this matter,
let us lay aſide Prejudice, and look beyond Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
like Engliſh-men, jealous of our Rights; for here ſeems
to be the Snake in the Graſs; what! ſhall Opinion give rule
to our Properties, and (like <hi>Daniels</hi> King) <hi>change Times and
Laws at Pleaſure?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing more miſerable in Government then that
it muſt alter with Religious Opinion, which yet we are not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55852:10"/>
aſſur'd men ſhall not change, and that often in an Age. I ſay,
this does not Reſt at Tranſubſtantiation (tho if it did, and
it were not juſt, 'twere no argument to a good man) The ſame
Power that is aſſumed in that caſe, may make a <hi>Teſt</hi> of what
it pleaſes, and a Mans Diſſent, a reaſon of Excluſion from Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Parliament, let not this be.</p>
            <p>We uſually ſay, no Stream riſes higher then its Fountain,
and whether this ſort of <hi>Teſting</hi> be not an Inverſion of the
natural Current of Power, may not be amiſs for <hi>Engliſh-men</hi>
to deliberate: Nay, if it be not a breach of that part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the Government: For if thoſe whom the People
chuſe, the Repreſentatives may reject, for a reaſon of their
own, that in the nature of Civil Government can be none,
the Electors and Elected muſt needs be Divided, in that the
one makes void the Power of the other, tho it be that by
which the firſt Houſe of Commons ſat, and is the natural
Authority of every Houſe of Commons in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Nothing, in my Opinion, can cure this miſchief better than
a due conſideration of the true nature of things: What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
falls under our Cognizance, and what not; and then to
adapt proper and ſutable means to the juſt ends we aim at:
For if the major vote in things not to be voted, could give
any weight or Sanction, 'tis to be feared the <hi>Jews</hi> were too
much in the right, when they cryed, <hi>we have a Law, and by
our Law he ought to Dye,</hi> however, upon theſe Principles,
nothing is plainer than that every Martyr was <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> and
Dyed a Malefactor inſtead of a Saint.</p>
            <p>Let us then be deliver'd of all <hi>Teſts</hi> that run not on the ſide of
the old Government of <hi>England;</hi> and if we muſt have a <hi>Test,</hi> I
ſhall pray that it may be tranſlated <hi>from</hi> TRANSUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTIATION
<hi>to</hi> PERSECUTION. <hi>That is
to ſay, that no Man ſhall propoſe or conſent to any thing in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
within this Kingdom, that may infringe the Conſcience or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55852:10"/>
Property of any man in it;</hi> for upon that ancient Policy our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
began; and let the <hi>Excommunication and Anathama</hi>
of the Government paſs upon that Offender, to his <hi>perpetual
civil Damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay no more to you now, what ever I may do at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
time, but that you uſe the utmoſt of your endeavours,
to promote <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity:</hi> And as on the one hand,
with all imaginable ſoftneſs, you ſtrive to oblige the Members
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to an impartial Conſideration of
theſe things, ſo on the other hand, you adviſe all Diſſenters
to Govern themſelves towards thoſe Gentlemen, in the uſe of
this Liberty, with a decent and friendly Behaviour: Who
knows, but that Conduct, with a little Time, may give
them that ſight of their Intereſt, and diſpoſe them to thoſe
Compliances, which may end this preſent miſ-underſtanding
in the happieſt civil Union, that any King and Kingdom
were ever bleſt with. God of his Infinite Mercy grant us
this great Bleſſing, and his Grace to uſe it, <hi>Amen.</hi>
