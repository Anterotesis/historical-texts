         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THESE following Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which contain the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Faith, and Customs
of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
are a Task, which some Years
past, Your Royal Self was pleased to
<pb facs="tcp:42203:3"/>
impose upon me; which though it be
a Work more proper and fit to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
by some Learned Divine,
rather than by a Person of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession;
yet, being moved thereunto
by Command of Your Majesty, I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
the Incumbence thereof to be
a Duty, as obligatory as any other Act
of Obedience which I owe unto your
Majesty, from which nothing but
Death, or Sickness, or some other vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
disappointment could absolve me.</p>
                  <p>But that I have been thus tardy in
the Execution of Your Royal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
was occasioned by my Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on Your Majesties Affairs in
<hi>Turky,</hi> which being protracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
my expectation, I deferred the
payment of this Debt until I could make
tender of it with my own hands, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally,
on my Knees at the same time,
beg a remission for the defect. Being
now therefore, by God's Providence,
<pb facs="tcp:42203:3"/>
returned to my own Country; behold
me <hi>(Great Sir)</hi> at the Foot-stool of
Your Throne to pay this my Vow,
which I always esteemed both Sacred
and Religious, and therefore tender
it with a fear and trembling agreeable
to that vast distance and disproportion
which is between Your Sublime Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and the humblest of your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:
For Your Majesty, who tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
in Wisdom, is able to penetrate
into the deepest Points of these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
and make more judicious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
thereon, than the ablest Clerks
and Criticks of the Schools; to which,
when I add that admirable Spirit
which. God often-times bestowes on
Kings, illuminating them like Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and bestowing on them super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent
Graces, I cannot but with
profound reverence and awe, expose
this little Work to the judicious and
perspicatious Eye of Your Majesty,
and with the same care and caution
<pb facs="tcp:42203:4"/>
offer nothing but what is sincere, and
approved by the Confession of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental
Faith, and allowed by the ablest
Divines of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church to be
consentaneous to their Doctrine, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therein offered nothing out of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiallity,
to the Cause of the Reformed
Churches, or prejudice to the Papal
Interest.</p>
                  <p>If this Treatise may find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with Your Majesty, I shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
my self extremely happy, and
be encouraged to dedicate all my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
hours, and recesses from more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and publick Services, to Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
grateful to Your Majesty, and
useful to my Country: For, being the
Son of that Father, who, by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
and Sufferings, hath set a fair
Example to his Posterity, of Loyalty
and Obedience to Your Majesty, and
of Conformity to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
I have, in the largest Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,
<pb facs="tcp:42203:4"/>
Copied out that Lesson, and
thereby delight my self in nothing so
much, as when I am performing my
Duty and Services towards God and
Your Majesty; who am, with all Alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity and Devotion,</p>

                  <head>THE
PREFACE</head>
                  <p>THESE following Treatises, of the
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> Churches,
contain a perfect Compendium (as
I may report) of those Principles
which they call the Articles of an Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Faith, deduced (as they profess) from
the purer times of Christianity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
uncorrupt from the Tainture and
Contagion of Heresie in all succeeding
Ages. I have not pretended in these ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Discourses to discover which are An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and which are Modern Positions, but
clearly to lay down the matter of Fact, how
they are held, and how maintained; Not
have I undertaken to confute those Tenents
which I find to oppugne the Articles of the
Reformed Religion, being of a temper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
averse to all Disputations, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inclinable to reconcile Differences, than
to widen them; that so, by a favourable
interpretation of all, that is not plain He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
<pb facs="tcp:42203:6"/>
or open Blasphemy, I might, as it
were, throw a Covering over the smaller
Blots or Blemishes of Humane Errours,
whereby all the Christian World (if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible)
might agree in Charity, to bear each
others Infirmities, and entertain no other
Emulations and Contests, than those which
tend to out-vy one the other in excesses of
Piety, and a vertuous Religion.</p>
                  <p>For besides the uneasiness I find in my
self on all occasions of Wranglings and
Debates, as well as an unsufficiency for Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick
Learning, I have observed, That ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few have yielded the Fort of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
to the force or violence of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
or Arguments, though Marshal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in all the Warlike Exercitations of the
Schools: For the Defendants, as Pride,
Interest, Zeal, and the Troops of other
Passions, which are the common Souldiers
of Reason, are so well fortified and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
within, that they fear no storm or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
from without; nor can they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to surrender by a long Siege and
Famine; for their nourishments, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only of Notions and Air, are never
to be reduced, until that <hi>Pabulum</hi> be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
and our Appetites breath their last;
and then, when Death comes, and we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Regions of Light, and our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects
<pb facs="tcp:42203:6"/>
become free and manumised from
the slavery and usurpations of our Passions,
we shall then, and not till then, discover
the sophistry of our Reasons; whereby those
Clouds and Mists will vanish, which vain
jangling about Words, Interest, Pride,
and the rest have exhaled, and therewith
obscured, and almost extinguished the true
Lamp of the Soul: Witness those Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
and Folios of Disputation between
the Reformed and <hi>Roman</hi> Churches; what
Kingdoms or Provinces have they convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
or what Universities, by plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of Argument, have they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
and caused to recant their Errour?
Nay what single person almost hath yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the conviction of a Syllogism, without
having first been prepossessed by an affection
to a side, or Party, on score of some Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or something of Example, which
they fancy, admire, and would imitate.
<hi>It is very easie,</hi> (as an ingenuous Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of ours saith) <hi>without growing to the
extream impudence of palpable lying, by leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the bad on one side, and good on the
other, by enforcing and flourishing all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
and Accidents which are in our
favour, and by elevating and disgracing the
contrary, by sprinkling the terms of Honour
wholly on the one side, and of Hatred and
<pb facs="tcp:42203:7"/>
Ignominy on the other, to make the Tale turn
which way it shall please the Teller.</hi> And
herein too many <hi>Protestants,</hi> as well as the
<hi>Papists</hi> seem to blame, who, being both
over-passionate towards their Party and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
have for the most part in the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Stories done injury to Truth,
abused the present Age, and injured poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
For I perswade my self, that had it
not been for the extream Ambition of the
<hi>Roman Jesuitical</hi> Clergy on the one side,
and the too hot and blind Zeal of some
Pharisaical Professors on the other, Truth
might have been established with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and all Churches reconciled without
railing Accusations, or personal Reproaches.
It is easie to pacifie when both Parties are
willing to condescend unto Expedients of
Concord and Peace, which is then only ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
when the Spirits of men are become
quiet and sedate, by the vertues of Meekness
and Charity, which are the only rare dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
unto knowledge and a godly life:
but when men will soare in their fancies
as high as Heaven, and there penetrate into
the Decrees of Predestination, dispute the
manner of the Holy Ghost's procession, and
dive into the Mysteries of the Holy Trinity,
and Secrets of the Eucharist, matters so
hidden and abstruse, that Angels look into
<pb facs="tcp:42203:7"/>
them with wonder and admiration, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Reason becomes giddy and blind, by
too rash an approach to those astonishing
lights, and loses it's way in that immense
cavity and vastness of distance which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Heaven and Earth: And when men
do only esteem and indulge their Party, and
damn all other Societies, what can be more
destructive to humane Politie? How can we
expect or hope for the conversion of <hi>Turks</hi>
or <hi>Heathens,</hi> when they shall be affrighted
at the Church Gate, by some Opposites to
one another of their own divided perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
with the threats of Hell and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and meet almost as many <hi>Anathemas</hi>
as when they remained Infidels? How can
we expect a Reconciliation and Concord,
whilst the <hi>Papists</hi> are so inveterate against
the <hi>Protestants,</hi> and all other Christian
Churches; that those who are most indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
zealous amongst them, believe the
Foundation of their Faith ought justly to
be subverted, not only by menacing Bulls,
and Excommunications, but by Fire and
Sword, by Massacres of the People, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of Kings by the <hi>Papal Authority,</hi>
and by the murder of their true and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
King, and of such a King as hath been
indulgent to all his Subjects, and to them
in particular? that if Religion had not struck
<pb facs="tcp:42203:8"/>
them with an awe and dreadful affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of shedding the Blood of God's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,
yet at least common gratitude,
and the Bowels of Humanity, should have
deterred them from a Design so full of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and amazement. But if the Head be
of these Principles, what else can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from the Members of it? If these be
the Foundations of their Religion, can
the super-structure be other than false and
wicked? for I am confident that that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is Unchristian, whose Conclusions are
Blood and Destruction. Whilest the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
confined their Disputes within those
Questions which were controverted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems,
such as the Infallibility of the
Church, Transubstantiation, Prayers to
Saints, and the like, on which Volumes
have been wrote, the Victory seemed doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
for, both sides, as in drawn Battels,
boasted of advantage. But when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to discover the rottenness of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
in Morality, which is naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
on the Consciences of men, and is
properly the Light and Lamp of the Soul;
such Morality I mean as allows mental Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,
<hi>Officiosum mendacium,</hi> or offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Lies, and a thousand other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions;
whereby Equivocations, False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods
and Lies, are not only excused and
<pb facs="tcp:42203:8"/>
made lawful, but the greatest impurities
hallowed and made good; then, I say, their
Adversaries took just advantage to render
their Principles not only destructive to a
Church, but inconsistent with the first Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Foundations of Government.
In short therefore, there is no way to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and Peace, but by Charity; to Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
knowledge, but by Faith and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
which are Divine Gifts, which we
must desire and pray for: When God shall
have conferred these upon us, we may lay
aside all Disputations, and enter into the
plain Path; nothing is then more easie to be
believed, than the Symbols of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
and other Creeds received by the
Church Universally; nothing more easily
practised, than the Commands of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue,
<hi>Fear and love God above all,</hi> and
<hi>Love your Neighbour as your self,</hi> and <hi>those
especially of the Houshold of Faith;</hi> this is
that which cuts short all Arguments, for
herein is comprised the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
                  <p>Considering the Premises, I shall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Lists of Disputation against any
point maintained by the <hi>Greek</hi> Church,
but however shall boldly reprove it, in the
generality of the people, of coldness and
want of Devotion, seeming only to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb facs="tcp:42203:9"/>
a meer out-side and shell of Religion,
laying more stress and efficacy on the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of their Fasts performed with
rigour and severity, and their Feasts celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with mirth and jollity, than on the force
of Prayer, and energy of a spiritual life.
And yet I am so far from condemning their
Lents and Fasts, which are so ancient, (as
may well be believed to have been Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical)
that I have entertained frequent
imaginations in my mind, that in so great
looseness of life, and decay of Discipline,
it was an especial Grace and Favour of
God, that the severity of Lents should still
be maintained and observed in those parts,
whereby the People are restrained from
Luxury, curbed from Prophaness and
Wantonness, and affected with some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of Religion: for whilest they fear
to eat any thing, though in secret, which
is a breach of Lent, they seem sensible of
the danger of what they apprehend evil,
and capable of more lively and more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
impressions. But the truth is, they are
ill instructed, or rather not taught at all,
Sermons and Catechising are rare amongst
them, Masses and Divine Service hudled
and run over in a cursory and negligent
manner, and all Offices performed so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functorily,
and with so little Devotion,
<pb facs="tcp:42203:9"/>
that if any people content themselves with
the <hi>Opus Operatum,</hi> it may be said to be
these, or, <hi>that have a form of Godliness,</hi> but
in many of them too little of the power
thereof.</p>
                  <p>Yet I cannot but almost retract what
I have said, when I consider, how they
are startled and affrighted at the Sentence
of Excommunication; how strict and
frequent some are in their Confessions, how
obedient and submissive to the censure
and injunction of the Priest; which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
do evidence some inward tenderness
of Conscience, and dispositions towards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
edifyed, and built up in a more perfect
frame and structure of Religion. But here
I lose my self and am amazed, when I
contemplate the light of the Gospel which
shines in our Islands, what daily Lectures
we hear from the Pulpits; the knowledge
we have from the Scriptures, expanded
and laid open to us in our own Tongue,
the Divine Mysteries expounded by learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Commentaries, and most Mechanicks
amongst us more learned and knowing
than the Doctors and Clergy of <hi>Greece:</hi>
And yet, good God! That all this should
serve to render us more blind, or more
perverse; for who is it that values the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
of a Bishop, or other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
<pb facs="tcp:42203:10"/>
Censures? who accounts of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gils
and Fasts according to the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Universal, and of their own
Church? or weighs the private Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a Priest, who is the Monitor of his
Soul? Nay, even those who profess O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
an efficacy to the power of the Keys,
and would not for the world be under an
Excommunication, and hold themselves
obliged to celebrate the Feasts with devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and rejoycing, and account the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>observance
thereof, the Characteristical
point of a <hi>Phanatick:</hi> yet, when the Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
Fasts take their turn, which impose
the same injunction on them of keeping
holy, as do the Feasts, they find excuses to
evade the obligation, and dispute against
all Penance, Mortification, and Severities
of life, as grounded on the Doctrine of
Merits, and Works of Supererogation:
And in this manner elude that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
duty enjoyned by Christ himself,
where he saith, That <hi>when the Bridegroom
is taken from them then they should fast,</hi>
and would abolish that signal mark of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
which by its rigour and frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
distinguishes it from all other Religions
in the World. Some, I know, will be apt to
attribute this abridgment of the Clergies
<pb facs="tcp:42203:10"/>
power to their supereminent knowledge,
and more clear light of Scripture, that they
are better instructed than to be guided by
their Priests, or to stand in awe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of a supercilious Prelate: but
such Learning as this, derived from the
Principles of Pride and Licentiousness, is
far worse than ignorance: and that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who is humble and submissive, apt
and willing to be instructed, is a better
Christian, and in a more secure path
and way to Godliness and Heaven, than
he, that having heard and read much,
stands dangerously towring on the presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Pinnacle of his own Reason.</p>
                  <p>And indeed this adherence to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of their Church, is the proper Basis
and Pillar of their Faith: For those ancient
janglings, and controversies, which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
the <hi>Greek</hi> Spirits in former days, and
through the acrimony of their malice and
hatred, opened a breach in divers pales of
the <hi>Eastern</hi> Church, whereby the whole
surface of things, was over-whelmed with
the vast inundation of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie;
are Tragedies so sadly recorded, that
the present Age seems, by the memory of
those Examples, so far to dread the danger
of divisions and innovations; that they
refuse to amend even that, which by their
<pb facs="tcp:42203:11"/>
own confession is an Errour, either in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
or practice: but it is no wonder,
that those from whom God hath removed
the ancient glory of his Candlestick bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shining amongst them, should delight
to dwell in the twilight of Batts, and groap
in an <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkness: but it is strange,
that those to whom his mercies and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
indulge the clearer Rayes of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
should forsake the Sun-shine of divine
Illumination, to follow fantastick and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
lights, mistaking them for that great
Pillar of Fire, which conducted the <hi>Israelites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another great help to support, and
maintain the Eastern Church, is their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
to a Priest; for by nothing more
doth the Power and Authority of the
<hi>Greek</hi> Church and Clergy seem to be
maintained and asserted; who account it the
sole Axel on which the Globe of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Politie turns; and that without it
they can neither have Influence on Mens
Consciences, nor, under the power of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
and Aliens, govern the least Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
of their lives and manners.
I know not how far the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy
may have abused this Excellent evidence
of repentance, this Ordinance of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
this admirable means to inflame our
devotion, and to guide and instruct us
<pb facs="tcp:42203:11"/>
in the rules of holy Living: It is more than
probable, that their use of it in an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and familiar manner, rather in form
than substance, without regard to feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or real Penitentiaries, and as an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragment
to annimate men to sin, when
they can so easily be pardoned, hath afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
just occasion to those, who desired a
Reformation, to exclaim against it, and
to take it wholly from the Church, as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
so entirely corrupted, as never
more to be reformed or recovered, but by
a total abolishment. The Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(as I am perswaded) apprehended it
under this notion, when its Wisdom, and
perhaps I may say the Spirit of God,
thought fit to dispence for a time with this
Discipline of Penance, but with intention
to restore it again when the time should
become more seasonable, and we our selves
more worthy to receive so profitable an
Institution; as our Rubrick seems to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
in the Office appointed for the first
day of <hi>Lent.</hi> And this Doctrine is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Sermons and Writings of our
Divines, and given as Counsel in that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
preceding the Communion Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
that we should confess our sins, not
only to God and our Brethren whom we
have offended, but in Cases of scandal and a
<pb facs="tcp:42203:12"/>
troubled Conscience, or other need of
Ghostly Counsel and Advice, to consult
God's Ministers, the Priests; in which Case
also our Church hath provided a Form of
Absolution.</p>
                  <p>Considering which Premises, it will not
be difficult to conjecture under what No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the <hi>Eastern</hi> apprehends the <hi>Western</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches; for they, taking notice
that the <hi>English</hi> neither keep Fasts, nor
practise Confession, nor ordinarily make
the Sign of the Cross; and that the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Nation at <hi>Smyrna</hi> rehearse no Prayers, at
the Burial of the dead, are not only scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalised
thereat, but also <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi>
take offence at the silence of Prayers when
the dead are buried; wondering what sort
of <hi>Heresie,</hi> or <hi>Sect,</hi> is sprung up in the
World, so different from the Religion of all
the Prophets; at which undecent practice,
the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy taking advantage to
disparage the <hi>Protestants,</hi> represent them
to the <hi>Greeks</hi> under the notion of <hi>Calvinists,</hi>
whom they characterise to be such as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
all Order in the Church, the authority
of Priesthood, abolish Fasts, abhor the
Cross, contemn the Saints, besides a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
other <hi>Heresies</hi> and <hi>Schisms,</hi> in which
they report we are at odds amongst our
selves: And in reallity, were it not that
<pb facs="tcp:42203:12"/>
the <hi>English</hi> Nation, by the orderly use of
their Liturgy, and Discipline of their
Church, observing the Lords day and the
Grand Festivals, did vindicate themselves
of these Aspersions; it were impossible to
perswade the Oriental Countries, that
those which we call Reformed, were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
or at least to retain any thing of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and Apostolical Institution: Upon
which score, the <hi>Greeks</hi> detest that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Faith, supposed to be wrote by
<hi>Cyrillus,</hi> their Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
in the year 1629, and Printed and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the year 1631, by <hi>Mattheus Caryon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilus,</hi>
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Iconium;</hi> for that
Confession, agreeing wholly with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Calvin</hi> in every particular, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in a great measure to have been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
on him by the <hi>Jesuits;</hi> who, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
their inhumane Persecutions of that
worthy Prelate, by making <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi>
the Instruments of their rage, formed
and vented any thing which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Curses and <hi>Anathemas</hi> of the Old
and New <hi>Rome.</hi> I am perswaded that
this <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> having spent some time in
<hi>England,</hi> and there observed that purity
of our Doctrine, and the excellency of
our Discipline, which flourished in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:42203:13"/>
Martyr, and viewed our Churches trim'd
and adorned in a modest Medium, between
the wanton and superstitious dress of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the slovenry and insipid Government
of <hi>Geneva,</hi> entertained a high Opinion of
our happy Reformation; intending thence
perhaps to draw a Pattern, whereby to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
and correct the defaults of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church, retrenching the length of their
Services, and the multitude of their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
and also by that Exemplar to
reduce their Festivals to a moderate num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
to create a right apprehension of the
state of Souls after separation, and wholly
to take away certain conceits both super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
and savouring of <hi>Gentilism,</hi> and
confirm his Church in a reverend Opinion
of the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist,
without lanching so far into the explication
of that Mystery, as of late they have done
both in the <hi>Anatolian</hi> Confession, which
was generally owned and confirmed in the
year 1672, by the Subscription of the four
<hi>Oriental</hi> Patriarchs, and of the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
then present, at the Instance of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nointel,</hi> Ambassadour for his
most Christian Majesty, a very intelligent
and ingenious Gentleman. And had not
this good Patriarch been thus malitiously
prosecuted, and his life taken from him
<pb facs="tcp:42203:13"/>
by unhappy Wiles, he might, with God's
assistance, have accomplished a work of
Reformation, and piloted the Church into
that state of Apostolical Purity, which King
<hi>James, Erasmus, Cassander, Melancthon,
Buçar</hi> the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Spalatro,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did design.</p>
                  <p>But God, it seems, hath not as yet or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
the time for so happy a Conversion
and Reformation, which is a Blessing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be wished for at present than to be
expected; till when, it is the duty of all
good Men, and the Elect of God, to offer a
continual Sacrifice of Prayer on the Altar
of their hearts, that he would be pleased
to grant us Unity of Faith in our Religion,
and Peace and Concord in all Christian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
that being one Sheepfold, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one Shepherd, the <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> we
may imitate the Example of him who is
the Prince of Peace.</p>

of the conquering Eagles; and
when the Imperial Seat was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported

                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42203:17"/>In this easiness of living things
continued until the year of Christ
1300. when an unexpected Storm
arose from the East, which, as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Cloud, appearing first at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
like a spot, or the measure
of a Palm, doth afterwards diffuse
it self in a general blackness over
the Face of the whole Heavens;
or as I have seen at a large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
something like the Swarm of
a single Hive, which, approaching
nearer, hath proved to be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of Locusts in those infinite
numbers as have darkened the Sun
at Noon, and over-spread the
Vallies, but even now green, proud,
and luxuriant in the Plenty and
Fruit they bore. Just so the
<hi>Turk</hi> from an inconsiderable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
contemned, and scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his petty Neighbours, much
more by the Puissance and Power
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42203:18"/>
of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperours, came
on a suddain like a Whirl-wind
from the East, and, like Locusts,
over-spread the Face of <hi>Asia,</hi> and
now feeds and triumphs in the
most pleasant and opulent parts of
<hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But because Providence in this
World doth not ordinarily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of things without rational
Causes and previous Dispositions,
(not to dispute here that which
some affirm concerning a certain
period prefixed by the secret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of God's decree, to the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
and Being of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
no more rational Causes
can be assigned to have concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
towards the destruction of the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Dominion and Liberty,
than their own luxurious Security,
Avarice, and Faction. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in ease, begot in them neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42203:18"/>
and security in their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
blindly permitting the <hi>Turks</hi>
to pass over the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> and build
a Castle on the <hi>European</hi> side, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the notion of a Sheep-pen, or
Inclosure for their Cattel; and on
the other side of the <hi>Hellespont,</hi>
took little notice when their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were transported, and had
taken a Fort Which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the name of, <hi>A Stye of Hogs:</hi>
they laughed at the <hi>Turks</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
for a Stye; and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in this careless way of living
and drollery, until the Enemy,
from the Kennel of unclean Beasts,
had penetrated into the Palaces
of their Emperour, and violated
all the Sanctuaries of Divine and
Humane Rites. Covetousness, in
like manner, which is the root of
all Evils, robbed the Treasury of
their Princes; and the Officers,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42203:19"/>
with Detestable Corruption, prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on what was levied for the
maintenance of War, and having
enriched their own Coffers, starv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Publick; by which means,
all Warlike Preparations ceasing,
the Souldiery became mutinous
and unruly, and the People faint
and discouraged. The Factions
also, in the Civil Government,
were not less dangerous, caused
by Emulations, Jealousies, and
Treachery (Evils incident, even at
this day, unto the Nature of this
People;) for their Hatred, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensions
were heightened with such
inveterate Malice, each towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as could more easily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to an Enemy, than conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to a Citizen; <hi>Externo potius
applicet, quam Civi cedat.</hi> With
this quarrelsome temper of the
<hi>Greeks, Q. Flaminius</hi> was anciently
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42203:19"/>
so well acquainted, that fearing
their Dissensions amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(after he had withdrawn his
Army from <hi>Greece</hi>) might expose
them to the Sword of
<hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi>

all the States of

which, like
the Bundle of Arrows,
could hardly be broken
by the greatest Force. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
disorders, and this factious
temper, were Preludes to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire,
which first being made Christian
and equally glorious to any
Church of Christ, both for Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and for the Zeal of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
was through the Grace of
God more excellently prepared
with Passive Vertues to sustain the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42203:20"/>
Yoke of the Grand Oppressor,
which was imposed on them for
not better observing the Law of
Christ's Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>In this condition, we are now to
consider of this lost and undone
Empire, whose Crown and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
being fallen to the Ground,
and not farther to be accounted
amongst the great Potentates, who
sway and govern the Earth; we
are to treat of it, as of a number
of People professing the Gospel of
Christ; and in Spiritual Matters
submitting with all obedience to
the Government and Rule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
them by such Pastors and
Ministers, as have, by succession
of Ages, been instituted and set
over them by Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
And being here to speak of
a Church-Christian, we are not to
treat of it as of a single Province,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42203:20"/>
as of <hi>Hellas,</hi> or as confined to <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica</hi>
alone,
<q>Ab Isthmi Angustiis Hellas incipit.</q>
nor as afterwards by enlargement
of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

<hi>Achivi, Danai, Myrmidones, Pelasgi,</hi>
and <hi>Argivi,</hi> were nominated with
the common appellation of <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>

and as such a number of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who in any part of the World

                     <p>The <hi>Greek</hi> Church is ancient,
and had the Blessing and Honour
to be taught by the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42203:21"/>
for <hi>St. Paul</hi> himself was
their great Doctor, by whom the
Gospel was first preached at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi</hi>
in <hi>Macedonia;</hi> next at <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica,</hi>
the chief City in <hi>Mygdonia;</hi>
then at <hi>Athens</hi> in <hi>Attica,</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi>
in <hi>Peloponesus. Apollos</hi> also
came from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> being instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> and
preached the Gospel in <hi>Achaia,
Acts</hi> 18. 24. And so gloriously
was the Doctrine of Christianity
received and propagated by the
vast numbers of Christians, who
crouded into the Church, that for
the better Government thereof, it
was thought fit and necessary to
dispose them under several Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions;
so St. <hi>Paul</hi> constituted
<hi>Dionysius</hi> at <hi>Athens, Aristarchus</hi>
at <hi>Thessalonica, Epaphroditus</hi> at
<hi>Philippi, Silas</hi> at <hi>Corinth, Timothy</hi>
at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> in the Isle of

                        <hi>Crete,</hi> now called <hi>Candia:</hi> and so
generally were the <hi>Greeks</hi> in those

this Church was, with what Zeal it

it shined, under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and succour of its nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Fathers the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
is not our Theme in this
following Treatise: But our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
here is more Tragical, the
subversion of the Sanctuaries of
Religion, the Royal Priesthood
expelled their Churches, and those
converted into Moschs; the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of the Altar conceal'd in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42203:22"/>
and dark places; for such I
have seen in Cities and Villages
where I have travelled, rather like
Vaults or Sepulchres than Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
having their Roofs almost le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
with the Superficies of the
Earth, lest the most ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surgency
of structure should be
accused for triumph of Religion,
and to stand in competition with
the lofty Spires of the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
Moschs. But so it became
Christ to suffer; and, in imitation
of that Grand Exemplar, his
Church, as Members of his Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Body, conforms to his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Humility and Patience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the promise of our Saviour
is verified, That the Gates of Hell
shall not prevail against his Church,
and that Tyranny and Oppression
shall never subdue the Constancy,
or abate the loud Profession of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42203:22"/>
Christian Religion. And as the
increase and prevalency of the
Christian Faith against the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Kings and Emperours,
and all the Terrours of Death, is
a demonstration of its verity; so
the stable perseverance in these
our days of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church
therein, notwithstanding the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and Contempt put upon
it by the <hi>Turk,</hi> and the Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Pleasures of this World,
is a Confirmation no less convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
than the Miracles and Power
which attended its first beginnings:
For indeed it is admirable to see
and consider with what Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Resolution, and Simplicity, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and poor men keep their
Faith; and that the proffer of
Worldly Preferments, and the
priviledge which they enjoy by
becoming <hi>Turks,</hi> the Mode and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42203:23"/>
Fashion of that Country which
they inhabit, should not decoy

much is to be attributed
herein to the Grace of God, and
the Promises of the Gospel; and
if any Art or Polity can be said to
have place over the affection of
the People; none seems more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious
than the strict observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the History of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
more (I dare say) than by

the Honour which they gave

of their <hi>Regimen;</hi> for that
which commands the conscience, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
the body, will, and affections

in Ecclesiastical Polity, it is the
Fence and Hedge of the Sheepfold.
This being broken down, the Sheep
stray, and Satan enters with his seed
of Heresie and Schism; for what
can hinder men from running into
Prodigies of Fansie and wild Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
where every man is his own
Pastor and his own Bishop? This
apprehension of Power which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends

capacity; for, besides the energy

amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> the defect
of a Temporal Authority: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that they (though Subjects of

about matters of Right
follow the advice of the Apostle, by
referring the determination of their
Cause to the arbitrement of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
men, and chief of their Saints,
who are their Bishop or Patriarch,
and other Chiefs of their Clergy,
rather than to stand to the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

that Right which others hold by

of our Saviour, <hi>My Kingdom is

as are religious and devout amongst
them, esteem it a Crime highly scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
and savouring of a bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
to have recourse rather to
a <hi>Mahometan Divan</hi> than a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Sentence; as if those who can

Church produces a firm belief and
strict adherence to the Articles of
it, and to all the Ceremonies and
matters the most minute and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
not suffering the least change
or alteration in them: which in this
conjuncture and state of things
seems very convenient, if not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
in the <hi>Greek Church.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Greeks</hi> presume not to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Practice.</note> For
though they are sensible (as many
of their Priests have confessed to me)
of the inconvenient length of their
Liturgies (concerning which we
shall speak in another Chapter) and
of many superstitious Customs and
Ceremonies derived to them from
the times of <hi>Gentilism,</hi> which are
now ingrafted into, and as it were
grown up with their Religion, and
many other Rites of which the wiser
men are ashamed, and wish they
were amended; yet they fear to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and alter them: Nay (as they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42203:26"/>
have assured me) the very alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Old to the New Stile would
be highly hazardous; lest the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
observing their Guides to vary in
the least point from their ancient,
and (as they imagine) their Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Profession, should begin to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the truth of all, and from a
doubt dispute themselves into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,
and thence into an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
desertion of the Faith. Though
the Christian Religion profess'd in
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Dominions lies under a
Cloud, and a sad discouragement,
yet, thanks be to God, there is a free
and publick exercise thereof allowed
in most parts, and something of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
given to the Clergy, even by
the <hi>Mahometans</hi> themselves, who
esteem honour due to all persons of
what Profession soever, who are set
apart and consecrated to Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
For it is evident that the <hi>Turks</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> have some opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note>
entertain something of a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42203:26"/>
of the sanctity of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion, and a belief that God
hears their Prayers, because that in
the time of common Pestilence, or
Calamity, both the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi>
Patriarchs are enjoined by
the <hi>Turks</hi> to assemble their People
and pray against it. This permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Christian Religion indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the <hi>Turks,</hi> is both agreeable
to <hi>Mahomet's</hi> Doctrine, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
granted by the <hi>Sultans,</hi> who
in their Conquests of the <hi>Grecian</hi>
Empire judged that a toleration of
Religion would much facilitate the
entire subjection of that People.</p>
                     <p>The greatest burden that is laid
upon them by the <hi>Turk</hi> is their <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratch</hi>
or Poll-money, for which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man who is arrived to 20 years
of age pays Four <hi>Lyon</hi> Dollars <hi>per
Annum;</hi> and Youths between 15
to 20 pay half so much; but Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are exempt from this burden.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42203:27"/>
Also <hi>Greeks</hi> who have Lands and
Houses are taxed <hi>pro rato</hi> for extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Expences, for entertaining
a <hi>Pasha</hi> or some great Person, whose
charges they are obliged to defray
in his passage through their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
and this Tax is as well common
to <hi>Turks</hi> as <hi>Greeks.</hi> But this is a
matter inconsiderable in respect of
that Custom of Decimation, which
was a taking away of the Tythe, or
every Tenth of Male-children from
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them in the respective Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
out of which proceeded the
best and stoutest of the <hi>Turkish Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisaries:</hi>
but this Custom is now
wholy out of use, not having been
practised for many years; either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Turks</hi> are willing to lay an
easie Yoke on the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or because
so many of them turn <hi>Mahometans,</hi>
and of other parts and Nations such
numbers flock daily to the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42203:27"/>
of <hi>Turcism,</hi> that there is no
need of this unnatural addition to
increase the Power and Kingdoms
of the <hi>Turk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But with what freedom soever
Christianity is licensed amongst the
<hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> it lies under a
Cloud, and a greater abhorrency in
<hi>Asia</hi> (unless in the Maritime Towns
and Places, where Traffick and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
have taught them Civility.)
For <hi>Mahometanisme</hi> having had its
first Original in <hi>Asia,</hi> is most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
observed in those Eastern
parts, where Christian Priests are
forced to live with caution, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate
in obscurity and privacy, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the superstitious temper of the
<hi>Asian</hi> Zealots, who are of a Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical
humour, high esteemers of
their own sanctity; in comparison
of which, they account the <hi>Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Turks</hi> loose and negligent Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
defiled by the use of Wine, and
unhallowed by their conversation
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42203:28"/>
with the Christians, to whom they
commonly bear so horrible a detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that some of them judge it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to be in their company, or
receive presents from them, or to
give them the salutation of peace,
and esteem their Cloaths, if touched
by Christians, to be polluted Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
profaning their prayers. It
is generally observed, that Pharisai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal<note place="margin">The pride of Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.</note>
Professors in all Religions are the
worst people in the world, and the
greatest disturbers of Humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
and the peace and quiet
of a Commonwealth. I knew once
at <hi>Smyrna</hi> a Reverend Preacher a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Turks,</hi> or as you may
call him a Doctor or Schoolmaster,
who had many Pupils under him,
whom he instructed in the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
Law, who was so great a lover of
his own Sect, that he hated the rest
of Mankind; his Sermons were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
stuffed with Invectives against
Christians, charging <hi>Smyrna</hi> with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42203:28"/>
unpardonable sins, for indulging
priviledges unto them, and for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
them into their Country on
consideration of that lucre and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
which their Trade brings: in
which discourse he oftentimes suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
himself to be so extravagantly
transported with intemperance of
language, that at length the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the City were forced to put
him in mind of the common scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
he gave to the interest and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
of the Inhabitants; that
those discourses reflected on the
<hi>Grand Signor</hi> and his Government,
and were Declamations against the
clemency of their Emperour towards
his Subjects, and opposed those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations
and Articles which the
wisdom of their Government had
concluded with Christian Princes,
which were matters of that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as were neither safe for him
to handle, nor for them to hear:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42203:29"/>
with which Admonition though this
Pharisee grew more moderate in his
language, yet his pride and insolence
was not in the least abated; for when
he mounted his Mule, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his Followers on foot, of the
same rank and head, and accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
met with <hi>Franks</hi> riding abroad on
Horses (such they call all the West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
Christians) they would force
them to alight, and with great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
attend until the sanctity of so
holy a man were past: For their
Books (as they report) say, and teach
them not to suffer Christians to sit
on their Horses, whilst men of their
profession pass by them. But our
people little concerning themselves
with what is written in their Books,
and less supporting an insolence and
affront from them, there often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
rencounters and scuffles between
both parties, which had proceeded
to higher quarrels, had not the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42203:29"/>
seasonably suppressed the
insolence of that people; which was

from my self, who have with my
own Eyes beheld the strange Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe
of those anciently famous
Cities, which now, for the most part,
are forgotten in their Names, as well
as buried in their Ruines.</p>
                     <p>It seems that these ancient Cities
were not only famous for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
which moved our Lord
Christ, by the hand of the beloved
Disciple, to write them a Letter, but
likewise by a special denomination
were called the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi>
the less, though others might be as
renowned, and as devout as they;
in which the Gospel had been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and accepted, and might be stiled
with the same appellation, as parts
of this great Continent, which is
one of the quarters of the World.
But this term of <hi>Asia</hi> is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained

in which the seven Churches are sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate,
different, as <hi>Heylin</hi> observes,

from the <hi>Proconsular,</hi> which well

through <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and the Region
of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and were forbidden of

in <hi>Asia,</hi> after they were come to
<hi>Mysia,</hi> they assayed to go into <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinia,</hi>

not. Nor is the Name of <hi>Asia</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly

by the fire and smoke of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Inhabitants, this place cannot, in
my opinion, be esteemed less health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
than any other Maritime City in
the <hi>Levant.</hi> This City is still the
most happy and flourishing of all
the other Sister-Churches, having
still the Honour to be a Metropolis,
and to rule over those which were
formerly co-equals with it. The
convenience of its Port and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42203:33"/>
(being one of the finest Bays
in the world) caused the Christian
Merchants to chuse it, for the Chief
Scale of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire; whose
Trade increasing, and thereby the
Customs of the Grand <hi>Signor,</hi> began
in these late years to be taken notice
of by the principal Ministers of State,
and to acquire a Renown above all
the Cities in the lesser <hi>Asia:</hi> for this
Cause, the famous Vizier <hi>Achmet,</hi>
Son of <hi>Kuperlee,</hi> cast his Eyes upon
it; and understanding in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
this City was neglected, how its
ancient Buildings and Royal Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
were destroyed, its Aquaeducts
decayed, and no publick Edifice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
agreeable to the state and
glory of such a Mart and <hi>Emporium,</hi>
famous through the World, was
moved to take a resolution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
in some measure the pristine
magnificence of this City: which
undertaking to do at his own charge
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42203:34"/>
and expence, he erected a stately
<hi>Besasteene,</hi> (which is a place where
Shops are kept, like our <hi>Exchange</hi>) a
sumptuous Chane with a <hi>Bagno,</hi> and
Stables belonging to it, all built of
Free-stone, and covered with Lead,
except the Stables; which Stones
were brought from the ancient Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
of the old <hi>Smyrna;</hi> and also
formed and raised a handsom Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
for the Custom-house upon
Piles of Wood within the Sea: for
convenience of all which, he erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a stately Aquaeduct, and joined
so many Streams of Water into one
Current, that not only the New-Buildings
were supplied therewith,
<note n="*" place="margin">Besides 10 old Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which were dry, but again repaired.</note> but also 73 new Fountains were
added to this City; so that whereas
formerly some Houses were forced
to fetch their Water from far, now
every Family is well accommodated,
and every Street as well supplied
therewith, as most Cities are which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42203:34"/>
are seated in the great Continent of
<hi>Asia.</hi> All which was finished and
compleated in the year of our Lord,
1677.</p>
                     <p>This is the present State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of <hi>Smyrna</hi> in these Modern
times: How it was anciently, we
shall best understand from History,
and from the Remains of Antiquity,
of which few are discernable; as
namely, the <hi>Theatre,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Theatre.</note> which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the year 1675. wholy ruined
by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the Stones carried
down to raise the new Edifices: At
the destruction whereof it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
that in the midst of one of
the main Walls, there was found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
about a Bushel of Medals, all
of the Stamp of <hi>Galienus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
of which I my self procured
some; judging that this Theatre,
which was almost as ancient as the
City it self, might be repaired after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by <hi>Galienus,</hi> and this Copper-Coyn
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42203:35"/>
there inclosed in memory of
this Emperour, that future Ages
might acknowledge him to have
been the Builder of that stately Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,
whensoever time or Enemies
should bring it to destruction. Over
the Gate of the Upper Castle on the
Hill the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles continue still
engraved; and not far from thence
is the Tomb of S. <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> one of
the first blessed Martyrs of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of Christ Jesus, who was put to
death in the Theatre. At the Gate
of this Castle we speak of, there is
a great Head of Stone immured in
the Wall, something resembling the
Head of an <hi>Amazon,</hi> which the
<hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Coidafa;</hi> and thereof have
this Story. That in ancient times
the <hi>Archi-pelago,</hi> or <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea, was
once firm Land; but when <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
the Great intending to make
his Conquests as far as the <hi>East-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
was refused passage through
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42203:35"/>
the Countries of this <hi>Coidafa,</hi> to
whom the <hi>Archi-pelago,</hi> then firm
Land, was subject, he in revenge cut
that Neck of Land, which we call
the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> and thereby let in the
<hi>Propontis</hi> and <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea into her
Country, which made such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
and Inundation, as ever after
over-whelmed that vast Tract of
Land, which now makes a Sea, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only some few Isles, which were
the tops of Mountains, and make
up those many Islands which we find
in the <hi>Archi-pelago.</hi> And thus much
we are assured from a piece of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish</hi>
History: but it matters little
what the <hi>Turks</hi> report or write in
these cases; for it is more probable,
that that Woman which the <hi>Turks</hi>
call <hi>Coidafa,</hi> was that great <hi>Amazon-Smyrna,</hi>
which <hi>Strabo</hi> saith gave the
Name to this City; whose Face may
be that which we find enstamped on
Medals with the Inscription of<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:42203:36"/>The People that first built this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
came from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
the <hi>Leleges</hi> of their Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(as <hi>Strabo</hi> reports:) Afterwards
the <hi>Lydians</hi> demolished the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
so that for the space of 400
years it was inhabited rather like a
Village than a City, until <hi>Antigonus,</hi>
and after him <hi>Lysimachus</hi> restored it
to its ancient splendour.<note place="margin">The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
                        </note> The City
was chiefly built on the side of the
Hill; and it is now evident, since
the great Ruines round the Town
were digged up to supply the New-Buildings
with Stone, that all those
Ruines on the East-side of the River
<hi>Meles,</hi> were no other than Temples,
and Burying-places of the dead;
and particularly that which we call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Temple of <hi>Janus;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
demolished, proved no other
than a Vault full of Sepulchres, and
might become the Bodies of the
Monarchs and Princes of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42203:36"/>
I once believed it to be the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merium,</hi>
or the square Porch, which
<hi>(Strabo</hi> saith) was dedicated to <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi>
but my Eyes have evinced the
contrary; and it may rather be that
large Porch which we find situated
on the Hill near to the Castle.</p>
                     <p>Having taken this view of <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
let us proceed to the next Church,
which in my Travels was <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ephesus.</note>
distant about 45 <hi>English</hi> Miles S.
South-East from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and about
five Miles from the Sea, accounted
in ancient times for a Maritime Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by reason of the River <hi>Cayster,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>
                        </note>
which near to the Sea was capable
to receive the Vessels of those days;
but further up and nearer to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
it turns and winds so wantonly
through the Plains, and with such
curious doublings, as gave occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Travellers, upon the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
especially of <hi>Heylin,</hi> to mistake
it for the <hi>Meander;</hi> which Errour
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42203:37"/>
the Name which the <hi>Turks</hi> give it of
the lesser <hi>Mendres</hi> may confirm. But
before we enter into this City, (if
we may now so call it,) let us first
hear what <hi>Strabo</hi> reports thereof in
ancient times. It was encompassed
(says he) with that Wall which now
stands at the charge of <hi>Lysimachus,</hi>
who therefore named it <hi>Arsinoa,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Name of his Wife; but that
Name prevailed not long, before it
returned to its ancient denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> The Government
was exercised by a Senate, and in
matters of great importance all the
People were assembled. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Diana</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Temple of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi>
                        </note> was first built by <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siphron;</hi>
but this being burnt by one
<hi>Herostratus,</hi> a more stately Edifice
was erected by the large and devout
Contributions of the Female Sex:
but these not being sufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the Work, <hi>Alexander</hi> proffer'd
to compleat the remainder at his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42203:37"/>
own Expence, on condition that his
Name might be entituled to the
whole Fabrick. But this offer was
refused by the Complement of a
witty <hi>Ephesian, That it was not seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for one God to contribute to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of
another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All the Priests of this Temple were
Eunuchs, called <hi>Megalobizi;</hi> these
were in great Honour, and assisted
by Virgins. This City hath both
a Port and Shipping belonging to
it; but the Port is very shallow by
reason of the great quantity of mud
which the <hi>Cayster</hi> throws up; but
the City daily increases, and is the
principal <hi>Emporium</hi> of <hi>Asia</hi> on this
side of the <hi>Taurus. Pliny</hi> who was
also well acquainted with the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy
of these places, instructs us
farther, and tells in his <hi>Nat. Hist.
lib.</hi> 5. That <hi>Ephesus attollitur Monte
Pione, &amp; alluitur Caistro in Cylbianis
jugis orto.</hi> And true it is, that its
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42203:38"/>
situation is on the side of a Hill, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Prospect to the West towards
a lovely Plain, watered and embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
with the pleasant Circles of the
<hi>Cayster.</hi> Some Marshes there are
not far distant, and yet so far, as
that the Vapour of them seems not
to reach or corrupt the air of the
City. The Soyl produces abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
Woods of <hi>Tamerisk,</hi> which
over-running the Plains, render
them delightful to the Eyes of the
beholders. But nothing appears
more remarkable and stately to a
Stranger, in his near approach to
this place, than the Castle on the
Hill, and the lofty Fabrick of Saint
<hi>John</hi>'s Church,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>S.</hi> John's <hi>Church.</hi>
                        </note> now converted to
a <hi>Turkish</hi> Mosch, the biggest Pillar
in which is five <hi>Turkish</hi> Pikes and a
half in compass, which is upwards
of four <hi>English</hi> yards; these lifting
up their heads amongst other Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines,
and humble Cottages of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42203:38"/>
present Inhabitants, seem to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
that magnificent Structure,
which renowned and made famous
this City in ancient-History. But
at the entrance, a person stumbles at
Pillars of Porphiry, and finds an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie
passage over subverted Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Palaces; the memory of
what they have been is not preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Tradition, and few or no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
remaining to direct us.
Some marks there are of a Building
more ample and stately than the
rest, which seems to have been seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Suburbs of the City with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Wall; and therefore gives
us cause to conjecture it to have
been the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi>

This therefore might probably have
been the Temple of that Goddess,
which all <hi>Asia</hi> and the World wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
and caused that riot and
pudder amongst the Silver-smiths of
this place.<note place="margin">Acts 19. 27.</note> Under the Ruines of
this Temple we descended about 30
Stairs with Lights in our hands,
where we entered into divers narrow
passages, with many turnings and
windings, that it was necessary to
make use of a Clew of Thread to
guide us, which some therefore call
a Labyrinth; but to me it seemed no
other than the Foundation of the
Temple, which for Fabricks of that
weight and magnificence, is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42203:39"/>
the Rules of the best Architecture.
The air below was moist, and of a
suffocating heat, which nourished
Bats of a prodigious bigness, which
oft-times struck at our Torches, as
Enemies unto light, and Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of those Spirits which inhabit
the <hi>Stygian</hi> darkness. Not far from
hence was a stately Lavatory of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiry,
called Saint <hi>John</hi>'s Font, the
Diameter of which was about seven
<hi>Turkish</hi> Pikes, wherein (it is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
he baptized great multitudes

                     <p>About 10 Miles distant from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>From hence we passed on to <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tyria <hi>not</hi> Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atira</note>
so called by the <hi>Turks,</hi> which
by proximity of the name, is by the
Christians supposed to be <hi>Thyatira,</hi>
but certainly not without great Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
For <hi>Tyria</hi> is a City about 25
Miles distant from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
situated on the rising of a Hill,
well watered and planted with Trees,
that at a distance it seems to be seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42203:43"/>
in a Grove, lying open on the
North to a fruitful and pleasant
Plain: Observing here no Ruines or
marks of Antiquity, nor amongst
the <hi>Greeks</hi> themselves, born in this
City, any Tradition of the pristine
state thereof, (which often gives
light to probable Conjectures) I
confidently concluded, that this
place was not the ancient <hi>Thyatira,</hi>
but rather a modern City erected
by the <hi>Turks:</hi> and the more satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I am in this perswasion, when I
consider what <hi>Livy</hi> writes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the situation of <hi>Thyatira,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>37.</hi>
                        </note> before
he describes the Fight between the

that <hi>Antiochus</hi> had pitched his Camp

passing the <hi>Phrygian</hi> River, which is
the <hi>Hermus,</hi> he retreated, and again
encamped about <hi>Magnesia ad Sipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum;</hi>

<hi>Thyatira</hi> must have been somewhere
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42203:44"/>
between <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Magnesia,</hi> and
not another way, where it is now
vulgarly imagined; which I shall
make more clearly apparent in its

to the City which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Ak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hisar.</hi>

which is also forgotten in its

and yet we certainly discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it about four days journey South-East
from <hi>Tyria:</hi> In our way to
which we happily crossed the true
<hi>Meander,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</note> called by the <hi>Turks Boiuch
Mendres,</hi> or the great <hi>Meander,</hi> as
they call the <hi>Cayster</hi> the little <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres.</hi>
The first sight we had of it,
was from the top of a Mountain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part of the <hi>Tmolus,</hi> from whence
in the Plain beneath, we discovered
innumerable turnings and windings
of the River, with such variety as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42203:44"/>
might entertain the Eyes of a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for some hours with pleasure.
<q>Ipse recurvatis ludit Maeander in undis.</q>
And so continues to encircle all the
Plains it runs through, with wanton
Mazes, and with such a rapid cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that it stirred up the Earth and
Gravel from the bottom, so that we
found not the Streams of Water so
clear and Crystalline as we hoped to
have enjoyed, when we sate down to
make our Collation on the Banks of
the River; and so continues its swift
motion until it falls more gently
into the Sea, not far distant from
<hi>Miletum,</hi> now called by the <hi>Turks
Melas,</hi> the true place where Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> landed, when he sent for the

                     <p>The first place which we imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
might be <hi>Laodicea,</hi> was a City
called by the <hi>Turks Dingizlee,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dingiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee.</note> being
so esteemed by the <hi>Greeks</hi> who there
inhabit, and are not above 40 in
number; where they have a little
Church. But little credit are we to
give unto them, concerning the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
condition of their Nation; for
they who are in those parts, and
have lost their own Language, and
speak and understand no other
Tongue than the <hi>Turkish,</hi> are not
competent Judges of the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which extend themselves beyond
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42203:45"/>
the time of the <hi>Turks.</hi> Howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
the situation of that place,
which is exceedingly pleasant, and
not far distant certainly from the
true <hi>Laodicea,</hi> might yield us Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
sufficient to enquire for it in
that City, which is planted with all
sorts of Fruit-trees, watered with
plentiful Streams, and abounds with
all Provisions, either necessary or
convenient for livelyhood; so that
the <hi>Turks</hi> compare it with the air
and fruitfulness of <hi>Damascus:</hi> The
outward Walls are ancient, but neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
after the <hi>Turkish</hi> Custom; the
City within built low after the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Fashion of that Country, and
is chiefly maintained by a Trade of
<hi>Bogasines.</hi> Some few Churches
there are, which appear to have
been built by the Christians, now
converted into Moschs, so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
appeared in this case, which
could induce us to concur in Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42203:46"/>
with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that that place
was <hi>Laodicea:</hi> but being informed

four miles distant from thence, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them <hi>Eski-hisar,</hi> or the <hi>Old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle;</hi>
curiosity lead us thither, where
being entred, we found a City of a
vast Circumference, subverted and
overthrown, situated on three or
four small Hills: What first we had
sight of, was an Aquaeduct, which
guided us to the rest, beneath which
runs a River, which I call the <hi>Lycus,</hi>
nourished with two other Streams,
which I call <hi>Asopus</hi> and <hi>Caper,</hi> that
so the situation may agree with the
description which <hi>Pliny</hi> gives of it.

found, besides a multitude of other
Ruines, three large Amphitheatres,
and a <hi>Circus;</hi> the three first were
of a round form, consisting of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
50 Seats one above the other,
the Stones of which were not much
displaced. The <hi>Circus</hi> was long,
and at the end thereof was a Cave,
where the wild Beasts were kept, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for the <hi>Roman</hi> Sports, over
the mouth of which was an Arch

Many other Ruines there were of
mighty Fabricks, of which we could
receive no knowledge, nor make
conjectures, nor could we be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Inscriptions; for time and
Earthquakes had so strangely defac'd

It seems that this City suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much by <hi>Mithridates Eupator,</hi> yet
the excellency of the soil, and the
Riches of the Citizens quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
the damages, and restored it
again to its pristine happiness: For,
as I said, the situation of it is eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on two or three pleasant Mounts,
rather than Hills, which oversee the
most rich and delightful Plains of
all <hi>Phrygia:</hi> It hath to the North
the Mountain <hi>Cadmus,</hi> being distant
(as may be conjectured) about ten

hath its source, and over-flows
those Pastures round about, which
in the time of <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> bred
numerous Flocks of black Sheep,
which for the fineness of the Fleece
far exceeded the <hi>Milesian</hi> Wools.
And thus the Riches of their Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Manufacture, being added to
the Donative of two thousand Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,
which <hi>Hiero</hi> bequeathed to
that People, might be a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Revenue to the Publick, and
serve to raise them out of the dust,
when overthrown by Earth-quakes.

self within the circumference of the
Cave, so that a man may approach
to the mouth of it at that time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
danger: but if any living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ventures to go in, it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
expires: Cattel which have
been put in there have been drawn
out dead, and some Sparrows which
we let flye therein, presently dyed.
Those which attend the Temples

enter in without danger; because
perhaps that they are full of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastical
Spirit, and so are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by Divine Providence; or
else because they have discovered
some Conservatives against the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence
of that air. The Water of
<hi>Hierapolis,</hi> which so abounds, that
the whole City is full of Baths, hath
an admirable vertue for dying, so
that Colours dyed there with the
help of certain Roots, equal the best
Scarlets and Purple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Thus far <hi>Strabo:</hi> but what we our
selves saw and observed, was in this
manner.</p>
                     <p>We mounting at first an ascent
towards the Ruines, observed the
ground to be covered with a soft
brittle Stone, crusted by the hot Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which descend with a full
Stream from the Hill. Being come
to the top, the first Object which
presented it self to our sight, and to

put us in mind of our own morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
as well as of the period and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of Cities, were certain mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Tombs of entire Stone, I
may rather call them Coffins, with
Covers of the same cut in a Cubical
Form: one bore the Sculpture as it
seemed of <hi>Apollo</hi> in a Chariot, but
the Charioteer was dismounted, and
both he and the other part of the
Monument subverted. Other S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>
pulchres there were, like small Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels,
covered with ridges of vast
Stones, instead of Lead or Tiles to
cast off rain: other Vault and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel-Houses
lay open, where lay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the white Bones of men, light
and dry, and as durable almost as
the Walls of the City. Near here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
was the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> or a
place which seemed to have been
designed for Exercises and Feats of
Arms. Proceeding farther, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into a solitude so dismal, as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42203:50"/>
affected our minds with a strange
confusion, and with the thoughts
of the sad fate of this unhappy City.
The Waters which tumbled down
the precipice added by its mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
sound to the melancholy
of the place, and as they run petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
all before them, making rude
Channels for themselves of Stone;
and where sometimes they overflow
they petrifie the earth with a brittle
crust. In the midst of the City is a
Bath of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Arches, agreeable to the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence

the excellent Vertues of the Waters.
For I am of opinion, that the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of those Waters at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
drew Inhabitants to that place;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42203:50"/>
the situation thereof not being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
advantagious for Trade,
no more than the air seems condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to health, lying open to a large
Plain on the South, and is shut in
to the North with a high Mountain.
It might also in probability have had
the Name of <hi>Hierapolis</hi> from the
Medicinal Vertue of those Waters
which often have been accounted
sacred, and dedicated to some Deity;
or else perhaps the Cures they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
in many Diseases, might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
the Name on it of the <hi>Holy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
as Rivers and Fountains have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
less considerable occasions been
hallowed, and accounted sacred by
the Gentiles. Not far distant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains

Some Authors say, that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

which this City did abound, was
the reason they gave unto it that
Name of <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> or the Holy
City. And indeed the Ruines of

we may well believe, that the false
Gods had once there a great posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

the Walls and Pillars are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

Testament of <hi>Attalus</hi> the last King

his Treasure at <hi>Pergamus:</hi> the situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

But that which I observed of
the City <hi>Pergamus,</hi> as it now stands
at present, is this: that its situation
is on the side of a Hill, which <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi>
saith, is in a Conical Form, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a prospect into a most pleasant,
and fruitful Plain, watered by the
River <hi>Caicus,</hi> and abounding with all
sorts of Fruits the Earth also yielding
with little pains, or industry, causes
the people to become lazy and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42203:60"/>
which manured with the
same care as is practised in the like
naturally happy Countries would
prove one of the most fertile Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
and Paradises of the World:
for from the top of that small hill
which over-shadows the City, (small
I say in respect of the adjacent
Mountains) on which stands an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Castle, or rather the Walls
thereof ill repaired, so pleasant a
prospect discovers it self on all sides
of the Plain, as for some hours may
well entertain the Eyes of a Stranger
with great delight. The Inhabitants
being slothful, and abhorring la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
addict themselves principally
to Thefts and Robberies, being more
pleased to seize a Booty in their
Plains with rapine and violence, than
with honest and religious labour to
purchase their Bread by turning up
the rich Clods of their Native Soyl;
by which means this City goes more

and more to decay and ruine, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for want of Industry: So that
whereas about 10 years past there
were 53 Streets of this Town inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
there are now only 22 fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented,
the others are deserted,
and their Buildings go to ruine.
Here are still many remains and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of antique Buildings, such
as vast Pillars of Marble subverted:
One place seems to have been the
Palace of the Prince still conserved
by Columns of polished Marble,
which like Buttresses support the
Wall for at least 50 paces in length.
There are also the Ruines of several
Churches, one of which, more spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and magnificent than the rest,
is by Tradition of the <hi>Greeks</hi> of that
Country, reported to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to Saint <hi>John,</hi> and to have
been the Cathedral of that City. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other Churches are possessed
by the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and employed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42203:62"/>
their superstitious Devotion, amongst
which (as reported by the <hi>Greeks</hi>
and confessed by the <hi>Turks</hi>) there
are two, one anciently dedicated to
S. <hi>John,</hi> and another to S. <hi>Demetrius,</hi>
both which the <hi>Turks</hi> have relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished,
the first because (as report
goes) the Walls fall as much by
night as they are built by day; and
the other, because the Door of the
<hi>Menareh</hi> or Steeple, which above
where they call to Prayers points al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
towards <hi>Mecha,</hi> which is to
the South-East, did in a miraculous
manner after it was built turn it self
to the North, to which point that
Door now looks, of which I my
self have been an Eye-witness; but
what deceit may have been herein
contrived by the <hi>Greek</hi> Masons, I
am not able to aver. There are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
vast Ruines without the City of
arched-work, and some remainders
of a Theatre; but there wanting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions

it is probable that such vast Piles

                     <p>And now from this place we shall
proceed in our search and enquiry
for <hi>Thyatira:</hi> for being satisfied (as
is said before) that <hi>Tyria</hi> so called
by the <hi>Turks,</hi> could not be <hi>Thyatira,</hi>
for those undeniable Reasons before
mentioned: We passed on from
<hi>Pergamus</hi> South-East through the
Plains, with hopes to find some Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
on the North-side of the <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi>
River, and being guided there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by <hi>Ferrarius,</hi> who placeth <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira</hi>
between <hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Pergamus,
viz.</hi> 30 miles from the first, and 58
miles from the latter Southward:
and taking likewise direction in our
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42203:64"/>
journey from <hi>Strabo,</hi> who says, <hi>a
Pergamo versus Austrum montosum est
dorsum</hi> (on which <hi>dorsum,</hi> or ridge
of a Hill, is a handsome <hi>Turkish</hi>
Town, called at present <hi>Soma) quo
superato in itinere versus Sardes, urbs
est Thyatira Macedonum colonia, quam
ultimam Mysorum esse sunt qui dicant.</hi>
In this journey, when we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
our selves to draw near
to the Place, for which we
searched, we made enquiry of the
<hi>Turks</hi> for ancient Ruines, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
us to a certain place which
they call <hi>Mermer</hi> or Marble, called
so from the large Quarries of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
which arise there, and are the
finest and whitest Veins that ever I
beheld, of which there remained
certain ruined Houses; but they
were so evidently modern, that they
looked nothing like the ancient <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira,</hi>
but rather the subversion of
some <hi>Turkish</hi> Bui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dings; which, as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42203:65"/>
we understood afterwards, had been
deserted by its Inhabitants, and that
they removed thence to a more
commodious situation not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
which they denominated
from the white Marble-Rocks of
their old habitation, calling it <hi>Ak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hisar,</hi>
or <hi>White-Castle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To that place thence being about
five <hi>English</hi> miles we bended our
course,<note place="margin">The true <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira.</hi>
                        </note> and found it a City well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited,
and considerable for the
Trade of Cottons. At our entrance
into this City casting our Eyes on
Pillars and broken Stones with rare
Sculptures, and on certain Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which at a distance were so fair,
that they seemed almost legible, we
immediately apprehended, that this
must have been the ancient <hi>Thyatira:</hi>
farther enquiry gave light to our
Conjectures, and changed our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
into arguments of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
For entering now within
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42203:65"/>
the Gates of the Town, and espying
carved Works in Stone, more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
than the <hi>Turkish</hi> Nation it
self, and better polished than what
was ever effected by their Art or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
we immediately concluded,
that we had certainly found that of
which we had been so long in quest;
the which was more assuredly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
so soon as we read this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Inscription, which we took
from the Pedestal of a Pillar in the
midst of the Market-place, which
served to support the new Building.</p>

                     <p>The Island of <hi>Cyprus</hi> was in its
Ecclesiastical Government subjected
once to the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch;</hi>
but afterwards by the Council of
<hi>Ephesus</hi> as Canon the Eighth, and
the same again confirmed by the
Grace and Favour of <hi>Justinian</hi> the
Emperour, (whose Mother was a
<hi>Cypriot</hi> by Birth;) this Church was
made absolute and independent of
any other,<note n="*" place="margin">Cyprus.</note> and a priviledge given to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42203:70"/>
                        <hi>Anthemius,</hi> the Arch-Bishop in that
Age, to subscribe his Name to all
Publick Acts in red Letters, which
was an honour above that of any
Patriarch, who writes his Name or
Firm in black Characters, the which
was afterwards confirmed by the
Authority of <hi>Zeno</hi> the Emperour:
This Favour and Indulgence was
granted in honour to the Apostle
<hi>Barnaby,</hi> who primarily governed
this Diocess, where now his Sepulcher
remains. The Arch-Bishoprick, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time that it was under the
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the Republick
of <hi>Venice,</hi> was the Mother of 32 Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks,
but now by the oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and violence of the <hi>Turks</hi> hath
been reduced to one Arch-Bishoprick
and three Bishopricks. The first
hath its Cathedral Church at <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
and receives its Revenue from
<hi>Famagosta, Carpasi,</hi> and <hi>Tamasea,</hi>
which are immediately subject
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42203:70"/>
thereunto. The Bishopricks are,</p>
                     <p>First, that of <hi>Paso,</hi> and <hi>Arsenoia,</hi> or
<hi>Arsinoe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second, that of <hi>Cyti,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathunta,</hi>
anciently <hi>Cetium</hi> or <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
and <hi>Amathusia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third, that of <hi>Cerinia</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea,</hi>
anciently called <hi>Salines,</hi> or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamine</hi>
from <hi>Salamis,</hi> and was the
most renowned City of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                     <p>This Island before it was taken by
the <hi>Turks,</hi> contained 14 thousand
Villages: but after a Rebellion they
made against the <hi>Turk, Anno</hi> 1580.
and 1593. the greatest part of the
Inhabitants were either killed or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated:
to which the grievous
Pestilence which succeeded in the
Year 1624. added so irreparable a
desolation, that of the 14 thousand
Villages there remain not 700 at
this present time.</p>
                     <p>The Archbishop of this Island in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42203:71"/>
this year 1678. is named <hi>Hilarion,</hi>
and sirnamed <hi>Cicala,</hi> created and
promoted to this Dignity in the
year 1674. a learned man, and well
skilled in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi>
Tongues. His Revenue or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
arises from the Churches of
<hi>Famagosta, Carpasi,</hi> and <hi>Tamasea,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Ecclesiastical Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
but from the Villages he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
nothing, unless at the Visits
which he makes twice a year, some
Collection is made of Corn, Oyl,
Wine, and other Fruits, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Tythes, but rather by way
of Presents and Free-will Offerings,
than of Duties. From the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
he receives a certain annual
Income or Rent, according to the
Abilities and Possessions thereof, and
from every <hi>Papa,</hi> or Priest, a Dollar
yearly <hi>per</hi> Head: All which will scarce
maintain a Patriarch, or yield him
other than a poor livelihood. For
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42203:71"/>
when a Patriarch is first constituted,
a Purse of Money or 500 Dollars
is exacted, and paid to the <hi>Pasha,</hi>
and as much more to the <hi>Janisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi>
besides the ordinary growing
charges, which are yearly about
2500 dollars. For to the <hi>Pasha</hi>
every three Months are paid 166
dollars; and to the <hi>Janisary,</hi> which
is set for a guard to the Partriarch,
20 or 25 dollars, as he thinks fit
to agree: also upon the coming
of a new <hi>Kadi</hi> there is always a new
Expence, who commands what he
pleases in Money or Presents; so
that with these Taxes and Exactions
the Church is always harassed and
made poor.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop of <hi>Pafo,</hi> named at
present <hi>Leontius,</hi> who hath the City
of <hi>Arsinoia</hi> under his Jurisdiction,
gathers his maintenance after the
manner of the Archbishop. <hi>Pafo</hi>
was anciently a Port of good fame
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42203:72"/>
and renown, and is so at present;
from whence is yearly shipped off a
considerable quantity of Cottons,
Silk, and other Merchandise; but
by the oppression and hard usage of
the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the covetousness of
the Officers, is reduced to poverty
and want of people. The second
Diocess govern'd by its Bishop, is
that of <hi>Cetium,</hi> or after the Vulgar
<hi>Cyti,</hi> hath under its Government
the City of <hi>Limeson, Cilan, Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thunte,</hi>
and another City anciently
a Diocess, adjoined to it, called <hi>Cyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
of which place one <hi>Cosma</hi> was
Bishop some few years past, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of good Ingenuity and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
born at <hi>Tunis</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> and his Mother
of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> with whom having some
acquaintance, I had the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to make these Collections relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the state and condition of
that place.</p>

having three Cities under it, <hi>viz.
Solea, Pentasia,</hi> and <hi>Marathusa,</hi> the

on his Horse with a Train of
the Clergy, and principal Persons
of the <hi>Greek</hi> Nation, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied

all solemnity to the Patriarchal
Seat, at the entry into which he
is met and received by the chief
<hi>Metropolites,</hi> and others with wax
Tapers burning in their hands,
and by them conducted into the
Church; and there before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
is consecrated by the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> who habited in
his Pontifical Garments takes the
<hi>Patriarch</hi> by the hand, and seats
him in the <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Chair, sets
the Mitre on his Head, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits

<hi>Greek</hi> Clergy, for the Patriarchal
Power at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
many troubles in the Church;
for such whom Ambition and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness
excite with a desire of this
Ecclesiastical Preferment, and having
some Riches of their own, and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to make up the rest at Interest,
seldom or never miss the prize they
pursue; for the Arguments of Gifts
and Benefits are so prevalent with
the G. <hi>Vizier,</hi> and the other <hi>Turkish</hi>
Officers, that they can afford easie
admittance to the most frivolous
Accusation that may be objected
against the present Incumbent; by
which means the Patriarch is often
changed, and the Debts of the
Church increased, and the Election
rather in the hands of the <hi>Turk</hi> than
the Bishops; the one being guided
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42203:74"/>
by Bribes, and the other by Faction;
by which means the Debts of the
Church in the year 1672, (as I was
informed by the Bishop of <hi>Smyrna</hi>)
amounted unto 700 Purses of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
which makes 350 thousand Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
the Interest of which increasing
daily, and rigorously extorted by
the Power of the most covetous
and considerable <hi>Turkish</hi> Officers,
who lend or supply the Money, is
the reason and occasion that the
Patriarch often summons all his
Archbishops and Bishops to appear
at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that so they may
consult and agree on an expedient to
ease in some measure the present Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and Pressure of their Debts; the
payment of which is often the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of new Demands: For the
<hi>Turks,</hi> finding this Fountain the
fresher, and more plentifully flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for being drained, continually
suck from this Stream, which is to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42203:74"/>
them more sweet, for being the
Blood of the Poor, and the life of
Christians.</p>
                     <p>It is a remarkable Story, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pertinent to this place, which the
Bishop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> when he once
did me the honour to make me a
Visit, recounted to me. That not
long since certain Principal Officers
amongst the <hi>Turks</hi> perswaded, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forced, a poor, simple <hi>Kaloir</hi>
to stand Candidate for the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal
Office, and to cheapen it at
the price of 25000 Dollars, which
offer the <hi>Turks</hi> signified to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,
that so he might either pay
the Money himself, and thereby
purchase his Confirmation, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
to give way to a new Successor.
The whole Assembly of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Clergy were greatly perplexed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at;
yet knew not which way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve:
For to accept of this <hi>Kaloir</hi>
for Patriarch, who was poor, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42203:75"/>
brought nothing with him, besides
his contemptible Person and Debt
(which they must at length pay)
would bring a scandal and scorn on
the Church, besides the bad Bargain
they should make in exchange of
their Patriarch. Wherefore at length
applying themselves with great Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
to the <hi>Vizier,</hi> they obtained
a remission of 5000 Dollars of the
price demanded; and on payment
of 20000 procured the continuance
of their old Patriarch; which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being thus accommodated, the
Clergy desired that the <hi>Kaloir</hi> might
be delivered into their hands to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
punishment according to the
Canons of their Church; but this
would not be granted, lest such an
Example should deter Men from
the like designs, and thereby preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
the <hi>Musselmin</hi> Cause and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest:
Nor can the Laws and Canons
in the Church against <hi>Simony</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42203:75"/>
for the Clergy are tender to
assert their power of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in this point, or any other
part of their Spiritual Authority,
which the Temporal Power of the
<hi>Turk,</hi> in those Cases where his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
commands, over-awes and
frustrates; usurping a power more
Ecclesiastical, Supreme, and Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical,
than that of the Patriarch.
But to evidence the turbulent State
of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church,<note place="margin">The late differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Church.</note> we shall not
need to fetch Examples farther back
than from the year of our Lord
1670, when one <hi>Mythodius</hi> was Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in which
Office he had not been long seated,
before he was forced by one <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
to retire, and hastily to take up
his Bag and Baggage and be gone,
and flye for Sanctuary into the
House of the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadour;
it being usual for the new Patriarch
to seize on the person of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42203:76"/>
with his Goods and Estate,
for paying the Debts of the Church,
and part of that price for which the
Patriarchate was bought by him;
for which seldom wants some just
Cause, or at least a seeming pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
in regard, that not only the
real necessity of the Church Debts,
forces the Patriarchs to extort Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
from the People, but likewise a
provident care for their future sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,
prompts them to make
Friendship with the Mammon of
Unrighteousness, against that time
that they shall be necessitated to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
an account of their Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
And I have heard some say,
that this change of Patriarchs is so
necessary for the maintenance of
their Metropolites or Bishops, that
without it they might starve; unless
they had this pretence for frequent
Taxes: For levying Money in this
manner on the people, some of it
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42203:76"/>
sticks to their Fingers, providing
not only sufficient to pay the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
expected from their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Diocesses, but also for their
own support.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mythodius</hi> having no sooner, as
is said, quitted the place, but <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
entered, a person not only of a
considerable Estate, but well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
and respected in the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish</hi>
Court: Howsoever he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
not above a year, before he was
forced to give way to <hi>Dionysius,</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolite
of <hi>Larissa;</hi> who being a
monied Man carryed his business
with a high hand, and entered into
the Patriarchal Seat with all the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
usual at the Instalment to
that Dignity, procuring not only
the Banishment of <hi>Parthenius</hi> unto
<hi>Rhodes,</hi> but caused him also to be
Anathematized, and the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

all the Metropolites then present at
<hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding which, <hi>Dionysius</hi>
did not long sit quietly, before he
was disturbed with some vexations
from the Wife of <hi>Panaioti,</hi> Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Great <hi>Vizier,</hi> who being a
high-spirited Dame, and elevated
with the thoughts of her Husbands
Riches and Preferment, comported
her self in the Church, towards the
Patriarch, with an arrogance unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and mis-becoming the gravity
of a principal Matron, which caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Dionysius</hi> sometimes to resent her
Carriage, and to discourse contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibly
of her; as is natural for men
to speak of those who assume too
much unto themselves: With which
this Lady being provoked, made
Complaints to her Husband, who,
sympathizing with the grievance of
his Wife, attended an opportunity
to satisfie her Feminine Revenge;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42203:77"/>
the which was not long expected
before one <hi>Gerasimus,</hi> Metropolite
of <hi>Turnova,</hi> on the Borders of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachia,</hi>
presented himself as a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate,
or one sufficiently qualified
for the Patriarchal Office; and in
the first place applyed himself to
<hi>Panaioti,</hi> who being a <hi>Greek,</hi> and near
the G. <hi>Vizier,</hi> was best able to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
his qualifications and his offers
to the Court, the which he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in complascency to his Wife,
with that pressure and heat, that <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasimus</hi>
was speedily invested in the
Patriarchal See, and <hi>Dionysius</hi> depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and forced to content himself
with the Bishoprick of <hi>Phillipopolis,</hi>
where he remained with the Title of
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> of that place, which is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
given to those who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
born the Dignity of Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch.</p>
                     <p>Of all these changes and mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>Parthenius</hi> received intelligence,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42203:78"/>
though far remote in his Exile at
<hi>Rhodes,</hi> which he observed with such
attention, as served to shuffle him
into play at the next Game: For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the time of being Patriarch
amassed a considerable Treasure
(soon after the death of <hi>Panaioti</hi> the
great Patron of <hi>Gerasimus</hi>) he push<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again for the Patriarchal Office,
and notwithstanding all the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
made to the contrary, and
the formal <hi>Anathema's</hi> and Curses
used against him at the time of his
deposition, he wrested it again to
himself, and enjoyed it in despite of
all his Adversaries, for some Months;
until that <hi>Dionysius,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> of
<hi>Phillipopolis,</hi> observing what success
attended <hi>Parthenius</hi> in his Restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
resolved to tread the same
path, the which he prosecuted so
effectually, that he crouded out
<hi>Parthenius</hi> again, and in this year
1678, <hi>Dionysius</hi> sits in the Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42203:78"/>
Throne, there to remain until
some other, who making a new
proffer of advantage to the <hi>Turkish</hi>
Court, shall expel him from thence.
In this manner the <hi>G. Signor</hi> seems
to be Head of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church,
and Arbitrator in all their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
which every good Christian
ought with sadness to consider, and
with compassion to behold this once
glorious Church to tear and rent
out her own bowels, and give them
for food to Vultures and Ravens,
and to the wild and fierce Creatures
of the World.</p>
                     <p>In former times the Church paid
no more to the <hi>G. Signor,</hi> at the
change of a Patriarch, than ten
thousand Dollars; but the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Pretenders for this Office,
hath enhansed the price to 25000
Dollars. Formerly also the Instal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Patriarch was with the
Solemnity and Formality before
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42203:79"/>
premised; but the daily contests in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
that confusion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Office, as hath left no
place for honour or respect, so that
a Patriarch ascends his Throne, and
takes hold of the Mitre and Crosier
with as little Ceremony, as an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Priest or Curate takes posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his Living or Vicaridge, or
when he takes hold of the Ring of
the Church door.</p>
                     <p>The Patriarch cannot act in his
Office, nor any other Bishop in his
See, without a <hi>Baratz</hi> or Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from the <hi>G. Signor:</hi> Nor is any
Monastery allowed or protected,
nor the Prior or Guardian endued
with a power over his Monks, but

This, and such-like honour
of precedency, the Church of <hi>Greece</hi>
may yield unto the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and perhaps now rather in these
times of Oppression, wherein, being
humbled by the hand of God, they
seek not worldly Honours, nor
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42203:83"/>
swelling Titles, nor Dominions,
but are desirous only to govern in
the Hearts and Affections of their
people. <hi>Ambitio, &amp; cupido gloriae,
faelicium hominum sunt affectus,</hi> saith
<hi>Tacitus.</hi> However, the Oriental
Confession doth not seem to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
so far, in that it declares, That
notwithstanding the priority of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Antiquity which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
given to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and other
Churches before that of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
yet afterwards the Council of
<hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon</hi> did give
the primacy of honour unto new
<hi>Rome,</hi> and to the Clergy thereof,
by reason of the Imperial Power,
whose Seat was there. But let us
not only hear what the <hi>Greeks</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
do utter in this point, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the words of that famous <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi>
Father <hi>Paul Sarpus,</hi> who in
the 25th Chapter of his History of
the Inquisition, hath these pertinent
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42203:84"/>
and impartial words: The <hi>Eastern</hi>
and <hi>Western</hi> Churches continued
both in Communion and Christian
Charity for the space of nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years, and more; in which
time the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> was reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and esteemed no less by the
<hi>Greeks</hi> than by the <hi>Latines:</hi> He was
acknowledged for the Successor of
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and chief of all the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern</hi>
Catholick Bishops: In the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
raised by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> they
implored his Aid, and of other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of <hi>Italy;</hi> and this Peace was
easily kept, because the Supreme
Power was in the Canons, to which
both parts acknowledged themselves
subject. Ecclesiastical Discipline was
severely maintained in each Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
by the Prelates of it, not arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily
but absolutely, according to
Order and Canonical Rigour, none
putting his hand into the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of another, but advised one
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42203:84"/>
the other to the observance of the
Canons. In those days never any
Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> did pretend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Benefices in the Diocesses of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bishops; neither was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
yet introduced of getting
mony out of others by way of
Dispensations or Bulls: But as soon
as the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> began to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that it was not subject to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
and that she might, according to
her own discretion, alter any Order
of the Fathers, Councils, and of the
Apostles themselves; and that she
attempted, instead of the ancient
Primacy of the Apostolical See, to
bring in an absolute Dominion, not
ruled by any Law, or Canon, then
the division grew. And as this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
grew between the <hi>Eastern</hi> and
<hi>Western</hi> Churches for the causes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
so the same Reasons were the
causes of division and separation in
the <hi>Western</hi> Church it self: for, as to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42203:85"/>
considering men, nothing seemed
more absurd, than the Usurpation
of <hi>Rome</hi> over other Churches, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
thereon in secular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
so to the people who lived
under its Dominion, nothing could
be more Tyrannical and oppressive.</p>

and Jurisdiction, as ample, and as

for all Hereticks and Schismaticks,

                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:42203:89"/>The seventh enjoins an Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

namely, such as are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <p>THE Principal Fasts or Lents
are four. The first begins
the 15th day of <hi>November,</hi>
being forty days before <hi>Christmas.</hi>
The second is the great <hi>Lent</hi> before
<hi>Easter,</hi> beginning with ours accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Old stile, the which stile
they observe through the whole
year. The third begins the Week
after <hi>Pentecost,</hi> or <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> called
<hi>The Fast of the Holy Apostles,</hi> being
the time in which they judge that
the Apostles prayed and fasted when
they prepared themselves to preach
the Gospel, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 3. which ends
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42203:90"/>
the 29th of <hi>June,</hi> being the Festival
of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apostles;
so that of this Fast there is no fixed
number of days, but is some years
more, some less, according as the
Pentecost falls out, sooner or later.</p>
                     <p>The fourth begins the first of
<hi>August,</hi> and continues until the 15th,
being a Preparatory to the Grand
Festival, which they keep in honour
to the Assumption of our Lady, who
they say was bodily transported into
Heaven; which Fast is so strictly
observed, that even Oyl is forbidden
to <hi>Kaloires,</hi> and few others, especially
of Women, there be, but who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this prohibition; unless on the
6th of <hi>August,</hi> which being a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival
in memory of our Saviours
Transfiguration, they have a permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to eat Oyl and Fish, but on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
days they return again to their
slender Diet.</p>
                     <p>Besides which Grand Fasts there
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42203:90"/>
are some other Fasts, as the 28th of
<hi>August,</hi> in commemoration of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collation
or beheading of St. <hi>John
Baptist.</hi> Likewise there is another
Fast beginning the first of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
which continues until the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,
being the Feast of the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Holy Cross, in which
time of fourteen days the History
of the Passion is preached and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented.
But this last is only observed
by <hi>Kaloirs,</hi> and such as are entered
into Vows and a Monastical life,
whose profession is Mortification,
and their business Religion. In all
which times, they do not only ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from Flesh, or <hi>Lacticinia,</hi> such
as Butter, Cheese, and the like, but
also from Fish which have Scales or
Finnes, or Blood; only Shell-Fish, as
Lobsters, Crabs, Oysters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are
lawful, though it is probable that in
them there may be more of heat and
nourishment; excepting only in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42203:91"/>
that <hi>Lent</hi> which begins on the 15th
of <hi>November</hi> it is lawful for them
to eat all sorts of Fish, as also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ordinary and Weekly Fasts of
<hi>Wednesday</hi> and <hi>Friday</hi> oblige them
only to an abstinence from Flesh,
and what comes from thence, but
all sorts of Fish are freely indulged.
And though <hi>Wednesdays</hi> and <hi>Frydays</hi>
are for the most part Fasts through
the whole year, yet we must except
from hence, <hi>Wednesday</hi> and <hi>Friday</hi>
of the eleventh Week before <hi>Easter,</hi>
which they call <hi>Arzeiburst;</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whereof, as <hi>Christophorus Angelo</hi>
reports, was from the dog of certain
Hereticks so called, whom they used
to send with Letters: At lengh the

used to fast that 11th Week before.
<hi>Easter</hi> for sorrow; in opposition to
whom, and to have no conformity
with them, the Orthodox appointed
that <hi>Wednesday</hi> and <hi>Fryday</hi> of that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42203:91"/>
Week should be exempted from any
Obligation of abstinence.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Whitson-Monday</hi> they abstain
from Flesh and Fast, by reason that
the people, meeting that morning in
the Church, ask of God the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of his Holy Spirit, as he
gave unto his Holy Apostles, in
commemoration of which they eat
Flesh on <hi>Wednesday</hi> and <hi>Friday</hi> of
that Week. The 25th of <hi>March,</hi>
being the Feast of the Annunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Blessed Virgin, though it
happen in <hi>Lent,</hi> yet they have a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
to eat all sorts of Fish; as

to <hi>Epiphany, Wednesdays</hi> and <hi>Frydays</hi>
not being exempted, and the first
Week after <hi>Pentecost.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

a time when they may eat all
sorts of Milk, and what is made
thereof; likewise Eggs, and Fish of

begins on <hi>Monday</hi> as ours doth on
<hi>Wednesday.</hi> These Fasts are strictly
observed and undergone by them
with no less patience and sobriety
than superstition, supposing it a sin
not less hainous, willingly to break
this Fast, or transgress the rules of
this Abstinence, and with that the
Institution and Rites of the Church,
than to commit Adultery, or invade
the possessions of his Neighbour.
Education and Custom hath brought
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42203:92"/>
them to that Opinion of Fasting,
that they believe Christianity can
hardly be professed and subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. It is very pleasant to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
what <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> the Patriarch
of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> reports of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi>
Patriarch of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> who
being desirous to prove the sanctity
of his Church and Religion to be
greater than that of the <hi>Greeks</hi> or any
others, brings it for an Argument,
that they did not only abstain from
flesh and fish in <hi>Lent,</hi> but even also
from Beans and Pease, which the
<hi>Greeks</hi> allowed of, consulting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of their Appetite more than
true Religion. On these grounds
they can by no means be induced to
believe the <hi>English,</hi> and others of the
reformed Churches, to be Orthodox
Christians, because they neither use
Fasting, nor reverence the sign of
the Cross; two matters of great
scandal amongst them; though in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42203:93"/>
point of observation of the Feasts
according to the old style with them,
and by their opposition to the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> they are on the other side
more unsatisfied and doubtful what
to judge.</p>
                     <p>The severity of their <hi>Lents</hi> is more
easily supported by the expected en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of the following Festival;
at which time they run into such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
of mirth and riot, agreeable
to the light and vain humour of
that people, that they seem to be
revenged of their late sobriety, and
to make compensation to the Devil
for their late temperance and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
towards God; and this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy
of Mirth and loose De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery
they practise with so much
liberty, that their Priests reprove
them not for it, but rather maintain
Drunkenness not to be a Sin on a
Festival, being a hearty memorial
of the Holiness of the Saint, or a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42203:93"/>
Testimony of joy in commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the works of mans Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but this is spoken rather as a
corruption of manners than as a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
or Profession of that Church.</p>
                     <p>In the observation of these Fasts
they are so rigid and superstitiously
strict, that they hold no case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
may or can claim a Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and that the Patriarch hath
not power and authority sufficient
to give a License to eat flesh, where
the Church hath commanded Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence.
For suppose a person sick
to death, who with Broth made of
Flesh, or with an Egg may be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to life; they say it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he should dye, than eat and sin.
Howsoever perhaps the Ghostly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will be so far concern'd in the
others health, as to advise the sick
Penitent in such cases to eat flesh,
and afterwards confessing the sin
he promises to grant Absolution:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42203:94"/>
and this I have known to have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
been practised; which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
amongst the ignorant Priests
may be esteemed an excellent and
an ingenious accommodation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
humane Necessities and the
Institutions of the Church. But
such of the wiser sort who have stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
in <hi>Italy,</hi> and there been season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Doctrine of the <hi>Latines,</hi>
believe their own Church endued
with as much authority in Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,
as the <hi>Roman;</hi> and that the
difficulty of granting Licenses to eat
flesh, is a scruple grounded on that
Government, which is agreeable to
the present state of things, rather
than want of power in the Church
to grant Dispensations for it.</p>

Church.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE <hi>Greeks</hi> begin their Year
in <hi>September,</hi> observing the
first day thereof with jollity
and feasting, esteeming a chearful
spirit to be a good Omen, that the
succeeding year shall be prosperous;
though not being dedicated to the
memory and honour of any Saint,
it is no point of Religion to abstain
from labour, yet it is esteemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent,
arguing either covetousness
or a necessitous poverty.</p>
                     <p>The grand Feast of the Year (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all other Christians) is <hi>Easter,</hi>
or the Festival of the Resurrection,
at which time the <hi>Greeks</hi> have this
ancient and laudable Custom: When
they meet their acquaintance in the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42203:95"/>
Morning, or at any time within
the three days of <hi>Easter,</hi> they salute
with these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Christ
is risen; and then the other answers,
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, he is risen indeed; and
so they kiss three times, once on each
Cheek, and on the Mouth, and so
depart.</p>
                     <p>The second day of <hi>September</hi> is
the Feast of S. <hi>John</hi> the abstemious,
not of Precept but of Devotion,
and therefore is only celebrated by
<hi>Kaloires,</hi> and other Religious, in
honour of the holy S. <hi>John Baptist,</hi>
who by his severe and abstemious
life in the Wilderness set the first
Example of holy Fasts, to such as
would be Disciples of the holy Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</p>
                     <p>The twenty sixth is dedicated with
great honour and devotion to the
Translation of the Body of S. <hi>John</hi>
the Evangelist into Heaven: for
they maintain, that this S. <hi>John</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42203:95"/>
banished by <hi>Trajan</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
into the Isle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> and
there having wrote the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi>
he passed: over unto <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where
ending his glorious life he was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
but after some days burial his
Disciples searching for his Body in
the Grave, found it not; from
whence immediately arose a belief,
that his Body was assumed into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and placed in the Mansion of
<hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who in company
together shall again return to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
on Earth, before Antichrist is
perfectly revealed and made known
unto the World. And this they
partly ground on the words of our
Saviour to S. <hi>Peter, If I will that he
stay till I come, what is that to thee?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Greeks,</hi> as they delight in the
Histories of their Saints, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
them with as much variety
and fancy as the <hi>Latines</hi> do their
Legends, so I might in this place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42203:96"/>
long and tedious Histories of
them; but because the lives of most
of them are recorded in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and of the later of them in the
<hi>Synaxarion,</hi> (of which Book we
shall hereafter speak) we shall only
here mention <hi>Cosma,</hi> and <hi>Damianus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cosma and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus.</note>
and St. <hi>George</hi> the <hi>Cappadocian,</hi> which
are persons, who after the Apostles,
and immediate Disciples of Jesus,
with some Fathers of the Church,
such as St. <hi>Basil,</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> &amp;c.
take up a principal place in the <hi>Greek</hi>
Kalendar.</p>
                     <p>The first two are called the Holy
<hi>Anargiri,</hi> to whom I found a poor
Oratory erected at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which was
thrown up of late with a few loose
stones, encircling a little Altar with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Roof in the place of a more
ancient Church, whither the <hi>Greeks</hi>
resort on the first of <hi>November</hi> to say
Mass, and sing Hymns, in praise
and commemoration of these Saints
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42203:96"/>
whom they report to have been born
in <hi>Asia,</hi> their father a <hi>Gentile,</hi> and
their mother a <hi>Christian,</hi> called <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosa,</hi>
who educated these her two
Sons in Religious Piety, and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sciences; but they principally
addicting themselves to the studies
of Physick, did, by the Divine as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
cooperating with the means
of Herbs and Medicines, become
such perfect Practitioners that they
cured all Diseases incident to Man
and Beast without Money or other
consideration of Interest; for which
cause they were called the <hi>Anargiri,</hi> or
those that took no Money. They
farther report, That <hi>Damianus</hi> was
so strict in this point, that he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
greatly from his Brother <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
for having only accepted of two
Eggs from a poor Widow, though
employed on her self for an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent
or Cataplasm for the Sciatica,
that he ever after avoided all society
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42203:97"/>
and converse with him, and at his
death gave order, that his Brother
should not be interred in the same
Vault or Grave with him: the which
resolution of <hi>Damianus</hi> the Friends
of both designed to perform; but
that carrying the Corps of <hi>Cosma</hi> to
burial, they were met by a Camel,
which opening his mouth as mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously
as <hi>Balaam's</hi> Ass, admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Bearers to lay the Brothers in
the same Tomb together; for that
neither the Crime of <hi>Cosma</hi> was so
great, nor the difference so lasting,
but that both their Bodies might be
contained in the same Sepulchre,
whose Souls were already united in
the same heavenly Mansion. The <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loires</hi>
also farther boasting of the
Miracles of these Saints, tell us, that
at <hi>Athens</hi> there is a Well, adjoining
to the Porch of that Church which
is dedicated to them, which is dry
the whole year, excepting only on
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42203:97"/>
that day when their Festival is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
and begins to flow at the
first words of the Mass, which seem
to have the same Efficacy on this
Spring, as <hi>Moses's</hi> Rod had upon the
Rock, to produce a Flood of sweet
and delicious water, not only plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to the taste, but wholesom for
the Body, but dries up and fails with
the Evening of the Festival.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>George</hi>
                        <note place="margin">S. George.</note> the <hi>Capadocian</hi> is in like
manner highly reverenced by this
People, there being scarce a Town
where are two Churches, but one of
them is dedicated to this Saint, of
whom they recount many and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
stories; and what is most
strange, they believe them all. They
say that he was born of noble Blood,
and lived in the time of <hi>Dioclesian</hi>
the Emperour; under whom, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising
a bloody persecution, this
Saint, as a Champion of undaunted
Courage, publickly presented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42203:98"/>
owning and avouching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
to be the only, true, and saving
Faith, inveighing against Idolatry
and superstitious Customs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of <hi>Gentilism.</hi> This Christian
boldness sharpened the Arms of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
against the Saint, so that
the Executioner struck him into the
Belly with a Lance, which though
a great effusion of Blood followed,
yet the Wound closed, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
became whole: They tell us
of his being thrown into a Pit of
Lime, and his walking bare-foot on
Planks studded with sharp Nails; of
his remaining unconsumed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched
amidst the flames; of his
raising the dead; of his slaying a
Dragon on the Banks of <hi>Euphrates,</hi>
near a place now called by the <hi>Turks
Barut,</hi> which the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
of those parts show unto Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
to this day; by which varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Miracles many were converted
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42203:98"/>
unto the Christian Faith, amongst
which was the Queen <hi>Alexandra,</hi> Wife
of <hi>Dioclesian.</hi> At length, the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come that this Saint was to dye,
the power of his persecutors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
against him, by whom his
head being struck off, his soul ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into Heaven to receive the Crown
of Martyrdom. The <hi>Greeks</hi> (as I
said) have divers Chappels dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to St. <hi>George,</hi> amongst which, at
an obscure Village called by the
<hi>Turks Boschioi,</hi> not far from <hi>Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
there is one, where, on the 23th
of <hi>April,</hi> they carry his Picture in
Procession, accompanied by Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of <hi>Turks</hi> as well as <hi>Greeks,</hi> who
resort thither, the first for pass-time,
the others for mirth, company, and
devotion. This Picture, which is
drawn in Colours upon a Board, is
much of that bigness as a sign which
we hang before a Shop, and much
of that sort of Painting. This Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42203:99"/>
(they report, and many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, especially the Women) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
carried by a notorious sinner,
is endued with so much mettle and
courage of that Champion, as
soundly to belabour his Back and
Shoulders, but is more civil and mild
to the innocent, or to the less scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in the wickedness of life. I had
once the curiosity to see this Fury in a
Board, of which the <hi>Greeks</hi> related such
strange Stories, so that arriving the
Night before at the Village, the next
morning all things were provided
for the Solemnity; when one of
the Papases took up the Champion
on his Shoulder, accompanied also
with two others of the like bigness,
(I think one was the Picture of the
Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>) with these, all the
Company proceeded in a procession
with much quietness and gravity,
until they came under a large <hi>Chinar</hi>
Tree, or <hi>Platanus,</hi> where remained the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42203:99"/>
ruines of an old Chappel dedicated
to this Saint; Mass being here cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
and ended, the Priests re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
in their Habiliments, left the
Pictures to be carried home by the
Laity; when one, more forward
than the rest, with fear and reverence
took the Champion on his Shoulder,
which at first began a little to move
and turn itself, but at length came
to down-right blows, giving the
Fellow, who managed the business
very artificially, so many knocks
that it seemed to have beat him to
the Ground, when another imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
relieves him, and takes it from
him, and then the other two Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
begin the like rage, buffeting
and beating those that carry them,
with which there is so much noise
and confusion, that I never saw any
piece of Bear-Garden-like, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to it. This ridiculous piece
of folly and superstition pleases the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42203:100"/>
humour of the ignorant <hi>Greeks,</hi> and
scandalizes the Enemies of our
Faith; which when I saw, I wonder'd
at it, and blamed the remissness of
the Bishop, in presence of the Priests
who managed the solemnity of the
day. I asked one of them in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
whether he really believed that
the Pictures were inspired with life
and motion to beat sinners; to
which, making some pause, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unwilling to impose upon me
whom he judged difficult to give
credence to such matters, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that it was a thing doubtful,
and hard to be believed by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the Vulgar sort. And in
other occasions, discoursing with
the Prelates and Bishops of this
Church on the same subject, I seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be concerned, and transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with some little passion, that in
the sight of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> they
should give countenance to so great
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42203:100"/>
a Cheat, to the dishonour of our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Faith and Gospel, which is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
on a better foundation than
such idle and profane imaginations;
to which they gave me this answer,
That Custom had prevailed, and
that for some Ages this belief had
taken so deep root in the minds of
the ignorant, that it was hard to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
them, without dishonour to
the Saint, and danger to the whole
Fabrick of the Christian Religion;
for this belief being equally fixed
with the Doctrins of necessary Faith,
the confutation of this one would
bring the others into question; and
perhaps perswade the people that
they were now parting with the main
Principles of the Gospel, and that
therefore it was thought neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to let the Tares of false Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to grow up with the Wheat
of Orthodox Belief, until God,
who knows the time, shall separate
them, and pluck up the one without
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42203:101"/>
raising or extirpating the other. And
now, that the Reader may better
understand the Feasts in the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church without the help of a Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar,

in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the

sang his <hi>Nunc dimittis,</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church hath from long Antiquity
practised on the eighth day to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
their Children at the Church-Porch
to receive the blessing of the
Priest, who signs them on the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
Mouth and Breast, with the
sign of the Cross, as a Seal of the
Divine Grace, and a disposition to
receive the Holy Baptism, which
they call, <hi>The sealing of infants;</hi> and
afterwards says this Prayer.</p>
                     <p>O our God, we beseech thee to infuse
the light of thy person on this thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42203:106"/>
and seal the Cross of thy only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Son in his heart, and in his
thoughts, that he may fly the vanities
of this World, and the snares of the
Enemy, and follow thy Commands:
Confirm him, O Lord, in thy name, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
him in thy good time to thy Holy
Church, and perfect him by thy stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
mysteries, that so, living ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to thy commands, he may obtain
the Kingdom of Beatitude with thine
Elect, through the Grace and Mercy of
thy only Son, to whom, with the Life-giving
Spirit, be Glory now and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterwards the Priest taking the
Child into his Arms before the Gate
of the Church elevates it, and waves
it in the form of a Cross, and so
ends this Ceremony, which is the
introduction and preparation to
Baptism.</p>

                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:42203:106"/>Baptism (as the

it) is a cleansing or

                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </note> by thrice
dipping or plunging
into the Water, the
Priest saying at every dipping, <hi>In the
name of the Father;</hi> Amen; <hi>and of the
Son,</hi> Amen; <hi>and of the Holy Ghost,</hi>
Amen.</p>
                     <p>This thrice dipping or plunging
into the Water this Church holds to
be as necessary to the form of Baptism,
as Water to the matter; for proof
whereof is brought the 50th Canon
called <hi>Apostolical;</hi> which says, <hi>Si quis
Episcopus aut Presbyter non trinam di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersionem
unius mysterii celebret, sed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel
mergat in Baptismate quod dari vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur
in domini morte, damnetur. Non e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
dixit vobis Dominus, In morte mea
baptizate, sed Euntes docete omnes gentes
in nomine Patris, &amp; Filii, &amp; Spiritus
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42203:107"/>
sancti.</hi> In like manner they produce
the 42 Chapter of the Apostles Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
wherein they have these
words: <hi>Ter mergite vos Episcopi in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
Patrem, &amp; Filium, &amp; Spiritum
sanctum.</hi> If any Bishop or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shall not use a three-fold dipping
in this one mystery, but only dips
once in Baptism, let him be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> In farther favour here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are quoted the Homilies of St.
<hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who rhetorically discours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Vertues and Efficacy of
Baptism, he symbolizeth it with the
Life, Death and Resurrection of a
Christian; for the first plunging in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Water, as he saith, buries the old
man of sin; the second regenerates
and revives him to a new Creature;
and the third raises him to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of life Eternal; according to
that of S. <hi>Paul, We are buried with Christ
through Baptism that we might rise
with him:</hi> so that the <hi>Greek</hi> Church,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42203:107"/>
which receives the whole number of
the 85 Canons (which for their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
are called <hi>Apostolical</hi>) as made
by the Apostles themselves, or the
next succeeding Apostolical men,
doth believe them to carry very great
force with them, and therefore the
<hi>Ter mergite</hi> is as constantly practised
as if it had been the interpretation
of <hi>Ite Baptizate.</hi> The which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
being very ancient, was first
ordained against certain <hi>Hereticks</hi>
who denyed the Holy Trinity, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
only in the name of Jesus, on
those words of the Apostle before
quoted, <hi>We are buried with Christ by
Baptism,</hi> &amp;c. in opposition to whom
these three Immersions were used;
for they cannot deny the Trinity,
who in Baptism distinguish three
persons in the Divine Nature:
Wherefore, though nothing is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to Baptism, nor other Precept
than to be dipped or sprinkled in the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42203:108"/>
name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost; yet to
make a more exact Test, to say who
were Hereticks, and who were not,
it was judged necessary in those
days to super-add this Ceremony
to the more material parts of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>
                     <p>Before Baptism the Priest blows
three times upon the Child to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess
the Devil of his Seat; then
he pours Oyl on the Water in form
of a Cross, as a token of peace and
reconciliation between God and
Man, and of regeneration by the
Spirit, as appears by this Prayer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
following that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                     <p>O Lord the God of

the token of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
denoting the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Salvation, and
Grace by the flood, and
bestowing the fruit of
the Olive for perfecting
the mysteries of thy
Saints, by which thou
satisfyest those who are
in the Law of the Holy
Spirit, and in the Grace
of Perfection, do thou
bless this Oyl with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,

                     <p>Immediately before the Act of
Baptism, the Priest takes the Child
from the Arms of the God-father,
or Surety (of which the <hi>Greek</hi> Church
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42203:109"/>
requires but one) and making the sign
of the Cross with Oyl on the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
Breast and reins of the back, saith,

                        </gap>, <hi>The Servant of the

                        </gap>
, for cure of soul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;

that by hearing Faith may be
received, the Feet, that they may walk
in the ways of God, the hands, that
they may perform good Actions;
and thus the Child being anointed
the Priest dippeth it three times into
the Water, and looking towards the
East, saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>The
Servant of God is baptized:</hi> And these
are the Principal Ceremonies observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Baptism by the <hi>Greek</hi> Church.</p>
                     <p>In Baptism one God-father stands
at the Font, if it be a Male-child, and
one God-mother if it be a Female,
which Gossips or <hi>compari,</hi> and as
they call them in <hi>Greek comparos,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42203:109"/>
themselves to have the same
duty incumbent on them in the Care
and Education of the Child, as hath
the natural Father; and hereby so
great a Friendship is contracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Gossips, that ever after
they are concerned for each others
interest; and they fancy that imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
relation of a sacred consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity

they formerly did not admit them to
Baptism until 14; but by means of
such Preachers as the Patriarch of
<hi>Antioch</hi> sends amongst them yearly,
they were taught how necessary it
was to baptize Infants, and how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
it was to the practice of the

                     <p>CHRISM, though used in

being the Seal or Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the party baptized, in order
to a performance of those Vows
which he then makes. The Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

in form of Fire, enduing them
with supernatural graces and gifts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to that employment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they are called; so this Chrism,
which is an anointing of the Infant
with Oyl in most parts of the Body,
(as before mentioned) using these
words, <gap reason="foreign">

by Gods Church as a means
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42203:111"/>
to convey Grace and Strength to the
Receiver, the authority whereof is
grounded on the 2 <hi>Cor. c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22.
<hi>Now he which established us with
you in Christ, and hath anointed
us is God, who hath also sealed us,
and given the earnest of the Spirit
in our hearts.</hi> And as their Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

That is, as formerly the Spirit of
God was conveyed by the imposition
of hands, so now it is by this Chrism,
or anointing with Oyl: And the
<hi>Greeks</hi> farther say, That <hi>Dionysius</hi> the

proper Oyl is esteemed in the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church to represent the mysteries
of Grace, being used in Baptism,
Confirmation, in all their solemn

                        </gap>, as we have already
declared; and it is here to be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the <hi>Greeks</hi> do baptize and
confirm at the same time, and for
that reason this anointing is used.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Good-Fryday</hi> the Arch-Bishop,

a quantity of Oyl sufficient to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
all the manners of anointing for
the whole year, the which is worked
to a consistency as thick as Butter.
The Composition of which, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

taking it from thence, and being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

who carry Lamps in their hands, he
meets the Patriarch or Bishop at the

it at the left hand of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-Table;

is an appendage to the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42203:114"/>

they carry so much respect that they
eat it not, unless fasting; for being
a representation or shadow of the

for some say that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
into the place of the

represent the memorial of that

it is required, that they should come

like other abstruse notions, not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

quiet and dissentangled, wound up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the bottom of its own Thread,
until Faction, and Malice, and the
Schooles, have so twisted and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
the twine, that the end will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be found: Nor after so many
Volumes wrote by the most learned
on both sides for some Ages, until
the World be better informed or
satisfyed; until the wise God by the
illumination of his Divine Grace,
disperse those Clouds of Prejudice,
Interest and Ignorance, which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42203:116"/>
blinds the Minds, and prepossesses
the Spirits of the greatest part of
Mankind. It hath been a question
very dubitable, and not meanly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted,
what side the <hi>Greek</hi> Church
hath maintained in this dispute.
For if you will believe <hi>Cyrillus</hi> the
Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in the
17th Article of his Confession of
Faith wrote about the year 1630,
and printed 1633. his Sence and
Words are wholly agreeable to the
Tenents of the Reformed Churches
in this particular; from which those,
whose Education is purely of the
<hi>Greek</hi> Literature, instructed, and
taught in their own Monasteries, do
not seem much to deviate; for when
they carry this Sacrament to the
sick they do not prostrate themselves
before it, nor do they expose it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
to be adored, unless in the
very Act of Administration; nor do
they carry it in procession, nor have
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42203:116"/>
they instituted any particular Feast,
in honour of it: all which are Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that had this belief of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation
been agreeable to
the Faith of the ancient <hi>Eastern</hi>
Councils, they would not have
been less careful in ordaining those
particular notes of honour in the
Administration, than the <hi>Western</hi> have
done. Howsoever, such as have
had their Education in <hi>Italy,</hi> as
he who wrote the <hi>Oriental Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
together with those who sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
it, seem to concur wholly

, that is, When the Priest
consecrates the Elements, the very
substance of the Bread and of the

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42203:117"/>
in these words; <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
by which we perceive that the

which is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to signifie or express
Transubstantiation, which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
read in their ancient Fathers,
though they may have found Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically
used in some times before
the words <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>But the truth is, it is difficult to
make the <hi>Greeks</hi> understand the right
state of this question, for observing
that there is a Sacramental Change
granted to be of the Bread, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
consider it as no other
than a change which is substantial:
Nor is it a wonder that the <hi>Greeks</hi>
follow the <hi>Latines</hi> in this Doctrine,
since, (as we have said before) the
most learned men amongst them,
taking their Education in <hi>Italy,</hi> have
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42203:117"/>
in all points, wherein neither cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
nor Councils have determined,
taken up their Doctrines according
to the positions of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Schooles, whom therefore they
name by the distinction of <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>
For really others, which have had
their Education in <hi>Greece</hi> only, do
not follow this Novelty, and they
which do, contradict their own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy;
<hi>viz.</hi> that of S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi>
which is common to them both,
wherein after the compleat conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,
these words follow; <gap reason="foreign">

That is,
that all we who partake of this Bread
and this Cup may be united together
in the Fellowship of the holy Ghost,
neither to our damnation, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,

                     <p>The Laity, as well as the Priests,
communicate in both kinds, taking
the Bread and the Wine together in
a Spoon from the hand of the Priest.
The Bread is made of the finest
Wheaten Flower with Leaven, from
whence arises a sharp Dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and the <hi>Latines;</hi> the
latter of which argues, That it ought
to be without Leaven, in regard that
it is more than probably presumed,
that the Institution of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being ordained at the time of
the Passeover, it was administred
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42203:119"/>
with unleavened Bread, which
was only lawful on that occasion.
The Wine in the Sacrament before
Consecration they mix with Water,
in representation of the Blood and
Water which issued out of the side
of our blessed Saviour, opened by
the Spear of the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldier.</p>
                     <p>The mixing of Wine with Water
in this Holy Sacrament is no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of great Antiquity in the Church,
being acknowledged by most of the
ancient Writers,<note place="margin">Ep. 6.3.</note> Fathers, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
and particularly by <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
who believes it to have been so pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
by Christ himself. Others
judge it an Ordinance of the Church
only, but all agree and assent unto
it as to a Custom derived from a long
Antiquity. The Modern Writers
of the Reformed Religion, such as
<hi>Vossius</hi> and others<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42203:119"/>
because drinking the same
Wine at the <hi>Agapae,</hi> or Love-Feasts,
as they did at the Lords Supper, they
might give occasion to the World
to censure their Intemperance, were
their Wines, which in the <hi>Eastern</hi>
parts of the World are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and strong, not temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and their force abated with
Water: This probably may be the
Reason hereof, rather than any Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
that can be made from the
Example of our Saviour, declared in
the Holy Evangelists, or the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Church specified by the

of the Holy Eucharist is an ess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential
part of the Christian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and greatly controverted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:42203:120"/>In the Chancel of every Church

Bread and Wine are prepared for the
Communion; thereon is set around
Loaf in the form expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <figure/> which the Priest takes
in his hand, and with a
small Lance signs it three

                        </gap>,
<hi>as a Lamb before the

. Then thrusting his Lance
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42203:120"/>
into the under part, he saith, <gap reason="foreign">

, <hi>who shall declare his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration?</hi>
and so cuts out that from
the other parts of the Loaf, which is
designed for the Communion
which he himself is to receive, and
lays it on one side of the <hi>Patina.</hi>
Then he thrusts his Lance again into
the Bread, and says, <hi>one of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
with a Lance opened his side, and
presently came out Water and Blood,</hi> at
which words the Wine and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
are turned into the <hi>Chalice</hi> and
mixed, signifying the passion of our
Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>In the next place the Priest cuts off
a second part from the Loaf before
mentioned, and forms it in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
of a Triangle, Δ saying, <hi>In ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and memory of our blessed Lady,
Mother of God, and perpetual Virgin</hi>
Mary, <hi>through whose Prayers, O Lord,
accept this Sacrifice to thy Celestial
Altar:</hi> and this Triangular is placed

on the left hand of the formen with
these words, <hi>the Queen stood by in a
Vesture of Gold, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then the Priest takes the third
part of the Loaf, from which, with
his Lance in like manner, he cuts
out a small piece, and places it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the first, which he designed for
himself, and says, <hi>of the honoured and
glorious prophet, the fore-runner of
Christ,</hi> John <hi>the Baptist:</hi> then takes
out a second and places it under the
former, saying, <hi>of the holy glorious
Prophets,</hi> Moses, Aaron, Elias, <hi>and
all the other holy Prophets:</hi> then tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out a third, places it under the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and says, <hi>of the holy Apostles</hi>
Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul, <hi>and of all the twelve
Apostles:</hi> and so is finished the first
Order.</p>
                     <p>Next the Priest cuts another small
piece from the remaining parts of
the Bread,<note place="margin">Offerto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the dead.</note> and places it near the first
part, and says, <hi>of our Holy Fathers
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42203:121"/>
and Prelates, of</hi> Basil <hi>the great, of</hi>
Gregory <hi>the Divine, of</hi> John Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,
Athanasius, Cyril, <hi>and of
all the Holy Doctors:</hi> then he takes
another piece and places it under
that immediately before going, and
says, <hi>of the Apostle, first Martyr, and
Arch-Deacon,</hi> Stephen, <hi>and of the
holy Martyrs,</hi> Demetrius, Gregory,
<hi>and all the other Martyrs:</hi> then he
takes a third and places it under the

Antonius, Euthymius, Sabba, <hi>and</hi>
Onuphrius.</p>
                     <p>Then is taken out another par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
and placed under the left An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
of that part which the Priest is
to receive; who proceeds and says,
<hi>of the holy and miraculous</hi> Anargyri,
Cosma, † Damianus, Cyrus, <hi>and</hi>
John <hi>the merciful:</hi> under which is
also placed another particle, <hi>of the

Joachim <hi>and</hi> Anna; and last of all

is taken out a ninth particle in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> whose Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
is that day read, naming with
him the Saint, whose Festival is that
day celebrated; which nine parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Bread represent the nine Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchies
of Angels, and are adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to this Office in honour and
commemoration of the Saints and

                     <p>Then follows the Offertory for
the living.<note place="margin">Offertory for the living</note> The Priest taking another

                     <p>Then last of all is taken out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

we treat of the Office for the

                     <p>Things thus prepared in order for
the Sacrament, the Priest raises the
form of a Star in Silver, and holds
it over that Bread which is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Consecration in the Eucharist,
saying <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>the Star stood over the place where the
young Child was;</hi> and repeating some
short Prayers and Ejaculations, that
God would purifie him, and make
him worthy to offer this glorious
Sacrifice, he goes forth from the
place of the Offertory, and reads
the Epistle and Gospel for the day,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42203:123"/>
in representation of the Apostles go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth into the world to preach
and propagate the Christian Faith.
Then the Priest returning takes the
Bread and Wine, covers it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Consecration is completed,
and as they say themselves, not yet
transubstantiated, sets it on his head,
and goes in Procession with it
through all the Church, at which
time the people bow, worship, and
make the Sign of the Cross, casting
the sick and infirm in the way, that
the Priest striding over them, they
may receive some miraculous bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and remedy by the direct beams
and influx of the Sacrament: which
when I have objected to some Priests
as a thing strange, to see the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
adored before Consecration,
till which time they could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
them to be transubstantiated;
They knew not well how to answer
otherwise, than that they adored
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42203:123"/>
the Elements, as being in immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
capacity and disposition to be
converted into the true <hi>Body</hi> and
<hi>Blood</hi> of Christ.</p>
                     <p>The Creed, or <hi>Symbolum Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licum,</hi>

the Cover or Vail is taken off, called

                        </gap>, and then over the Bread the
air is moved with a Fan, signifying
the wind and breath of the Spirit,
which illuminated and inspired the
Apostles, when they composed the
Articles of this holy Faith.<note place="margin">The Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.</note> Then
are read the same words which we
use at the Consecration of the holy
Communion; <hi>viz. In the same night
when he was betrayed, he took Bread,
and when he had given thanks, he brake
it, &amp;c.</hi> Then follows this Prayer,
with some <hi>Soliloquies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lord who in the third hour didst

us, praying, Lord make clean our

                     </p>
                     <p>Which Prayer is repeated three
times with the head bowed down,
and then the Priest raising himself
again, with an humble voice saith,
<hi>Lord hear my Prayer,</hi> and lifting up
his hand by way of blessing, adds,
<hi>make this Bread the holy Body of
Christ. Amen.</hi> And here all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Consecration being finished,
he thus proceeds: <hi>Thou art my God,
thou art my King, I adore thee piously
and faithfully.</hi> And so covering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the Chalice, which contains

eating that part of the Bread, which
in the time of preparation, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into four pieces, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
three he puts into the Chalice,
of which with great devotion he
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42203:124"/>
sups three times, and having him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

and therein are also put the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Particles, which were laid aside,
and designed for commemoration
of the living and dead, of which
when the Priest hath received some
himself, the remainder is divided
amongst the Communicants. Thus
the Mass being finished, the Priest
cleanses the Cup with great care,
lest any thing should remain of the
Sacrament to be carelesly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely
treated.</p>
                     <p>It is the Custom in this Church
to conserve the Sacrament for the
use of the sick; but it is never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the view of the People, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
at the time of Celebration, and

                        <pb n="200" facs="tcp:42203:125"/>But a most laudable Custom it is
in this Church, That those who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

                     <p>In the relation of these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
I must confess my self to have
been much beholding to that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and ingenious person Mr. <hi>John
Covell</hi> late Chaplain to the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of his Majesty at <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
for many things related in this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
discourse; and being assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
also by many Informations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the <hi>Kaloirs</hi> belonging
to that place, I do not doubt but
perfectly to satisfie the most curious
Reader in all points relating to this
Treatise.</p>
                     <p>The Mountain <hi>Athos</hi> anciently
so called,<note place="margin">The Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</note> hath its situation on a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninsula,
or Isthmus of Land an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to <hi>Macedon,</hi> being about a
mile and a half broad, and three
miles long; it is low land, arising
something towards the foot of the
Mountain. And therefore the story
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42203:133"/>
of <hi>Xerxes</hi> cutting this Mountain
from the Main seems a Fable, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
perhaps by opening and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
that Ditch or Channel,
which to this day appears from Sea
to Sea, and might, once being clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
be rendred capable to carry a
small Galley or Brigantine. The
whole compass of this Mountain is
esteemed to be about 160 miles.
The high Pique or Peer thereof is
properly called <hi>Athos,</hi> and now
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> by the Inhabitants, and is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even,
craggy, and as horrid as <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easus;</hi>
but somewhat beneath it is
covered with Trees, Shrubs, and
Boscage, and produces many Plants
and Herbs of admirable Vertue: It
is a place full of little Springs, Rills,
and Rivulets, that there can be no
part so barren and unfruitful in the
whole circumference of the lower
parts of this Mountain, which may
not be capable of great and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42203:134"/>
improvement; and in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
thereof, there are so many Cells
and little Recesses, partly framed by
Art and partly by Nature, that it
seems a place of such stupendious
solitude, as if the situation thereof
had been designed for the retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Monks</hi> or the Cells of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When this place began first to

For though S. <hi>Basil</hi> was the
first Author and Founder of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Greek</hi> Monks, so that before
his time, there could be none, who
professed this strict way of living in
Convents, and Religious Societies,
I mean in <hi>Greece;</hi> yet certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this time, the convenience of
the place, and the situation thereof
might invite <hi>Hermites,</hi> and persons
delighted in solitary devotions, of
which the world in the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42203:134"/>
Century did abound, being
men who lived under severe Rules
of Fasting and Self-denyal, and

this day are called <gap reason="foreign">

But when the world was generally
converted, and gave it self up to

the life of <hi>Hermites</hi> became
of less reputation, and the lives of
the Religious in Societies to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
more secure, and more
tending to Edification: So that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries

All which several sums making
together not more than 900 Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
there will want 100 Dollars
<hi>per</hi> Month to complete the Tribute,

Monasteries,<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of taxing the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries.</note> occasioned by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty

denoted, which remain in the

the Tax: Wherefore it being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to find out the complete
sum of an hundred Dollars more
<hi>per</hi> Month, the other Monasteries
were forced to answer for the ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
of their Brethren, and to
add a new Tax proportionable to
the first estimation of their Revenue
and Riches. And now by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
it appears, that <hi>Laura, Bato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedi,
Chiliadar,</hi> and <hi>Ibero</hi> are the
four chief and most flourishing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries,
both in respect of their
Revenues abroad, as well as of the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42203:137"/>
limits of Land allotted them on the
Mountain: what their Lands and
Vineyards are, and benefits arising
from thence, is well known, and
may easily be calculated; but Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natives
arising from abroad, which
are the charitable Contributions of
well-disposed people, as they are for
the most part uncertain, so they are
hidden and concealed, as much as
is possible. Howsoever they all
plead misery and poverty, which
will be a Riddle and Mystery to any
person to whom they will shew or
expose their Treasure; unless they
be compared to the condition of
the wealthy miser, who is miserable
and starving amidst the heaps of his
Gold: for he that sees the various
Coverings they have for their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
the rich Ornaments they have
for their Churches, will not easily
apprehend those people to be poor.
For amongst their other Treasures,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42203:137"/>
they have first a representation of
Christ in the Sepulchre (which they
call <gap reason="foreign">

Gold and Precious Stones. Most
of their Monasteries can represent
the History of its Foundation, not
in Paint or Colours, but in Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deries
of Gold and Pearl, and other
pretious Stones intermixed with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Art and Curiosity. They have
also variety of rich Vestments for
the Priest, especially in the four
chief Monasteries, where are many
Chests filled with such Robes as are
used at the celebration of Divine
Service: Their Basons, Ewers, Dishes,
Plates, Candlesticks, and Incense-Pots
of Silver are not to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
many of which are of pure Gold,
or Silver gilt. They have Crosses
of a vast bigness, edged with plates
of Gold, and studded with preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Stones, from whence hang
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42203:138"/>
strings of Oriental Pearl. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of their Books of the Gospel,
Epistles, Psalters, and Missals, are
often embossed with beaten Gold,
or curiously bound up with Cases
of Gold, or Silver gilt, or plain
Silver. Many of which Utensils
and Ornaments have been the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
of the Dukes of <hi>Moscovy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time that that Country de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
or fell off from their respect
to the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople:</hi>
howsoever <hi>Moldavia, Valachia,</hi> and
<hi>Georgia</hi> remaining constant to that
Patriarchate, have been anciently,
and still continue to be very liberal,
and splendid in their Presents to
these Monasteries, towards one or
more of which some Prince or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of those Countries do always
evidence an extraordinary devotion:
especially the <hi>Georgians,</hi> whose
Country was anciently called <hi>Iberia,</hi>
are ever bountiful to the Monastery
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42203:138"/>
of <hi>Ibero,</hi> by whose Charity it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as considerable as any of the
other Monasteries. With such Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
and Donatives the Churches
of this Mountain are enabled to
make very splendid Processions,
which they practice with great state
and magnificence on the high Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals

of the Vulgar with so much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and devotion to the holy
Rites, that scarce any of them will
depart, or at least think he receives
a blessing by his attendance, unless
he leaves his gift behind him in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of his real and hearty affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
imitating perhaps the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Custom in the times of Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lism,
when every one who approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

something, though but a handful of

burnt, and others demolished in
the Contest; and at length the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi>

carried with them some of the holy

in this manner. He was, as
they say, born at <hi>Trapezond</hi> of a
good Family, of good parts, and of
some Learning; and being addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a godly retired life, he applied
himself to a certain reverend person
called <hi>Michael Maleinus,</hi> who was
a famous Confessor, and lived in a
Desart of that Country; with him
he conversed for divers years, was
his Scholar, and learned his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
in which he was so great a
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42203:141"/>
proficient, that <hi>Maleinus</hi> growing
old, and being desirous to ease him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of the burden of hearing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
recommended all comers
to <hi>Athanasius,</hi> who had now for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
years lived according to the
method of a severe life. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
that <hi>Nicephorus</hi> General of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, marching towards
<hi>Candia,</hi> for suppressing a Rebellion
arisen in those parts, applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to <hi>Maleinus</hi> to make his Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but he being grown old, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
his excuse, recommending him
to his Scholar <hi>Athanasius,</hi> on whom
he supposed that a double portion
of his Spirit did remain. <hi>Nicepho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
was so well pleased with the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> with his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Doctrine, and with his holy
and devout life, that he declared
himself resolved to live with him,
and retire from the world; and so
in every place blazing abroad the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42203:141"/>
sanctity of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> his fame
spread generally, and all people
flocked to him from parts far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote:
But this good man, being
of a true humble Spirit, and jealous
of the danger to which Fame and
Glory of the World might betray
him, departed privately from his
place of abode and came to Mount
<hi>Athos,</hi> where, counterfeiting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a poor illiterate Fellow, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the Servant of a Reverend and
Godly man, who lived with much
retirement and austerity of life. But
<hi>Nicephorus,</hi> returning afterwards
from the Wars, enquired for <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi>
in the same place where he
had before left him; but he being
secretly and unknown unto any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
search was made for him in
this Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> where <hi>Leo</hi> the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Nicephorus</hi> having found
him, embraced and honoured him
in presence of all the Monks, and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42203:142"/>
conducting him with joy to the
Emperour, was received with all
honour and satisfaction, and in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
thereof bestowed on him
a considerable sum of money for
building this Monastery. But <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus</hi>
dying before the same was
completed, this Founder was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to the Charity of others,
especially to the bounty of <hi>Tzimisces</hi>
This <hi>Athanasius</hi> lived ever after in
this Monastery a most severe life,
where his Cell still remains, and in
which is a white Marble-stone, worn
at least four or five Inches, as they
say, with his knees, being the place
on which he used to pray: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
wore an Iron-Collar about
his neck, to which he fastened a
Wooden Cross weighing six or
eight pounds, the which is shown
to Strangers, and used for a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
at the initiation of any <hi>Kaloir</hi>
into that Order. They Say he eat
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42203:142"/>
seldom above three or four times a
Week, and that he once lived seven
days without meat or drink, and
once nine days, excepting only that
he eat and drank the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
twice in that time. And thus
much for the Monastery of <hi>Laura.</hi>

oftentimes return richly freighted,
whom, in reward of their industry,
they not only receive with a hearty
welcome, but he who brings the
greatest Contributions is esteemed
worthy to be promoted for the
year following to be Prior of the
Monastery. Nor are these people
less cunning Artists in the skill of
begging, than are the <hi>Mendicants</hi> in
Christendom: I have observed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of them in sundry places, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Some who have been Oppressours,
and lived perhaps upon Rapine and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42203:149"/>
Violence, are of Opinion that they
attone for their sins, by sacrificing
part of their prey to this Mountain;
by which, and other Offerings, I
have heard, that within the space of
six months there stands Registred
above 2000 Dollars in the Book of
<hi>Laura,</hi> which have been given at
home, besides the Collections from
Foreign Parts.</p>
                     <p>The number of <hi>Kaloires, viz.</hi>

Priests, Deacons, and Lay-Brothers
belonging to the Mountain, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
to amount unto six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand;
of which commonly two
thousand may be abroad, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in making Collections; and
this number is reported by <hi>Bellonius</hi>
to have been in his time, which may
have been about a hundred years
past; so that it seems in these late
years the number hath not been
abated, though before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
made by the <hi>Turks</hi> we may
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42203:150"/>
suppose that they were far more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous.</p>
                     <p>These Monasteries, having for the
most part been founded by Kings
and Princes,<note place="margin">Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>depen dency on the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch.</note> have obtained an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
priviledge of being exempted
from the jurisdiction of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch,
so that they are not obliged
to make the acknowledgment of
one Asper of benefit unto him: All
the power he hath, is to constitute
an Arch-bishop over them, whose
Seat is at <hi>Careis,</hi> and another at <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dero-Capti,</hi>
but subordinate to the
Metropolite of <hi>Thessalonica:</hi> The
which Bishops are not farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
with them, than to say their
Liturgy, and ordain Priests; to
whom, for every Ordination, there
is due a <hi>Zechin</hi> and no more. But
all matters of Rule and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are solely in the hands of the
Chiefs or Priors of the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
respectively. The reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:42203:150"/>
is, because that the receiving of
members into the Convent, or the
passing from a Secular into a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
or Regular life, is no part of
Priesthood, which requires Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or a new Character, but only
the profession of a Vow or Solemn
renunciation of the World, which
comes not within the compass of
the Episcopal cognisance. Nor yet
hath the Patriarch so much power
as this over all the Monasteries, for
<hi>Batopedi, Laura, Contlomouses, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theo,
Stauronichetu, Pantocratora, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meno,
Dochano,</hi> and <hi>Ibero</hi> are exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
having about 20 or 30 years
past purchased their Enfranchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the Patriarch, so that
having no power over them, not so
much as to confine them to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Bishop for conferring of holy
Orders, they remain at liberty to
take and chuse what Bishop they
think fit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:42203:151"/>But in most other places where
there are Monasteries another Rule
is observed;<note place="margin">A Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish <hi>Aga</hi> set over them.</note> for the Patriarch hath
not only power to Ordain their
Priests, but to constitute their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
and to bestow the Office on
him who makes the best Offering
and richest Present to the Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate.
I said in most other places,
because the Monastry at <hi>Mavra Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
on the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> as also the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries
of this Mountain are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
having the great <hi>Bostangee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bashee</hi>
for their Protector, who year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at the beginning of <hi>March</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
some <hi>Aga</hi> for his Deputy to
collect the yearly Tribute or Rent
of 12000 Dollars, out of which
he is allowed ten Purses, or 5000
Dollars for his maintenance, besides
a Sheep a month from each Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
besides the Presents of Lambs,

                     <p>This Town of <hi>Kareis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Kareis.</note> or <hi>Kareais</hi>
as they write it, is seated about the
middle of the Mountain, where a
plentiful Market is held every <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday,</hi>
to which great numbers of
people (I mean of the Male Sex)
do there meet, where the Fryars buy
Cheese, Eggs, and as many Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Sheep
and Goats, as may supply
them with a sufficient provision of
Wooll for working, and for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
to their <hi>Aga.</hi> Here also they
sell their <hi>Manufactories,</hi> such as Iron
worked into Shovels, Tongs, Hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoos
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> also Boots, Shoos, Beads,
Crosses, and what else is the Fruit
of their Lands, or Surplusage of
their provisions, for all which they
are paid in ready money. At this
place the chief Monasteries have a
house, or lodging to receive their
respective members, who have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42203:152"/>
at that place; where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
did reside, a Steward, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative
of every Monastery,
though now fix only which are the
chief, remain there for all the rest,
<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Laura, Ibero, Batopedi, Chilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar,

                     </p>
                     <p>Above all, there is a common
House or Hall, where Synods or
Councils are held touching the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
interest of all the Monasteries,
which they call, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
whereunto there is near adjoyning
a very fair Church, built by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
the Great, dedicated to the
Assumption of the Blessed Virgin,
which they call, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>the sleeping of the blessed Virgin,</hi> which
Church, being very ancient, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
about 164 years past, as
appears by an Inscription on one of
the Walls. For maintenance of these

which inhabit them, and for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying

the charges of Candles,
Oyl, and Lamps, and support of
those who Weekly (that is on Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-days)
read the Liturgy; every
Monastery is taxed in proportion
to its Revenue. In all which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
of Religion, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of Secular Negotiations,
they live so free under the <hi>Turkish
Aga,</hi> that no <hi>Turk</hi> whatsoever,
without his License, can set his Foot
upon the Mountain; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
many persons of the
best and civillest quality obtain
when in the spring for their health,
and in the Antumne, when the Fruits
are ripe, they desire admission for
their pleasure and pastime: and at
their departure are free and liberal
in their acknowledgments to the
Monastery where they received
their Entertainment. This <hi>Kareis</hi>
is now the only Town on this
Mountain, though in the time of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42203:153"/>
                        <hi>Strabo</hi> there were five, <hi>viz. Dion,
Kleones, Thyssan, Holophyx,</hi> and
<hi>Akres-thous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have said that this Town of
<hi>Kareis</hi> being the common Mart,<note place="margin">The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the <hi>Kaloirs</hi>
                        </note>
whereunto the <hi>Kaloirs</hi> bring their
Manufactories; it is observable,
that the Lay-brothers, when they
enter into this Religious life, are
employed according to that Trade,
and work in which they profess
themselves most skillful: without
doors, they plant Vine-yards, ditch
and hedge them in, gather Olives,
and press out the Oyl, keep, and
shear their Sheep, but they neither
Plow, nor Sow; within doors, they
have their Black-smiths, who work
in Iron to provide them with
Matocks, Spades, and other Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of that sort for the Fields:
they have their Taylors, Weavers,
Cappers, and Workers in Leather,
who having supply'd the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42203:153"/>
with conveniences of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
sell the remainder to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
for money, the which accrues
to the benefit of the Convent, which
out of the common Stock provides
the materials whereon to work,
which when they are wrought, they
are then esteemed to be the Goods
of the Monastery. For as in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom
no Fryar is capable of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
Wealth unto himself, so
neither here can a <hi>Kaloir</hi> appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
the benefit of his own labours;
though perhaps an industrious and
skilful Workman shall have more
respect and care taken of him, that
he want nothing which is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for him, than those who are
Drones, or unskilful in any Art or
Trade. Whether such men as these
can read, or not, it matters not
much; for there is not one of a
hundred of them so well learned;
it is sufficient if he can make his
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42203:154"/>
Cross, and his <hi>Metagnia</hi> before the
blessed Virgin, which is a bowing
on their Knees, touching the ground
with their Forehead, which some
will do 300 times together, as I
have already declared in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chapter.</p>
                     <p>But the Fathers or Priests are of
a Classis or Form above these,<note place="margin">The learning of their Priests.</note> for
they can all read and write, from
the Prior to the lowest Deacon;
though very few of them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the learned or School Greek
in any perfection: for it would
puzzle the wisest heads amongst
them to interpret every word in
their Liturgy, and yet they are so
expert and ready therein, that they
can run from the beginning to the
ending without stop or hesitation,
and gallop it over at that rate, that
one must have a good ear and some
skill in the <hi>Greek</hi> Language, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
the different sound of the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:42203:154"/>
words which they utter: besides
which, their chief study is of the
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Hymns of <hi>John Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scen,</hi>
and to find out and know the
proper Lessons for the day, and the
Offices of the Church, with all the
Responses and Suffrages; which is
a Learning so intricate, as requires
some practice, and application of
the mind: But such as have any
Learning more than the rest, it
consists for the most in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
they have of the Fathers and
Councils of their own Church, and
in the Ecclesiastical Authors of the
first Century after <hi>Constantine</hi> the
Great. The Latine and Hebrew
Tongues, and any besides the Greek,
they contemn and esteem as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane:
Philosophy and Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
being matters of Humane
Learning, they account as unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for men who lead a morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and spiritual life, to whom also
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:42203:155"/>
all Books are unlawful, but such as
treat of Divinity, and a holy and
devout way of living.</p>
                     <p>Every Monastery hath its Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Books,<note place="margin">Their Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> which are kept in a
lofty Tower, under the custody of
one whom they call <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, who
also is their Steward, receives their
money, and renders an account of
all their Expences: but we must not
imagine that these Libraries are
conserved in that order, as ours are
in the parts of Christendom; that
they are ranked and compiled in
method on Shelves, with Labels of
the Contents, or that they are brush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and kept clean, like the Libraries
of our Colleges; but they are piled
one on the other without order or
method, covered with dust, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the Worm. They have
few Books amongst them but what
treat of Divinity, and as I have
heard they have scarce any of much
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42203:155"/>
worth; in regard that the Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of <hi>France</hi> and other parts, have
by force of money deprived them
of all the choicest Books in their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries:
Nor have they (as I have
been well inform'd) one Book that
varies in the least from the Doctrine
of the Seventh Council; for there
is not one Book to be found of those
which were wrote by those whom
they call Hereticks, esteeming that
the easiest way to confute a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
and stop his Doctrine in its
progress, is to condemn the same,
and burn his Book.</p>
                     <p>In every Monastery they have
Bells: such as they daily use are
small, but those of greatest bigness,
are of about 4 or 500 weight, which
they ring at Festivals, when they
would make the greatest noise and
rejoicing: on these their Clocks
strike, which are fixed like those on
our Churches in <hi>England;</hi> which
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42203:156"/>
are not to be found, as I remember,
in any other place in <hi>Turkey,</hi> unless
at <hi>Buda,</hi> where I saw one of this
sort.</p>
                     <p>For conclusion, In this manner
this Mountain of <hi>Athos</hi> is inhabited,
and this is the Government amongst
these Religious men of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church, who are for the most part
good simple men of godly lives, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
greatly to devotion and acts of
mortification; for as <hi>out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of the heart the mouth speaks,</hi>
so these men discoursing with a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sense of God and of his Service,
we may without over-much credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
or easiness of belief, conclude
them not only to be real and moral
good men, but such also as are
something touched with the Spirit
of God; whose devotion and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to his Commands and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
shall carry them farther in
their way to Heaven, than the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42203:156"/>
of the most profound Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
or the wisest Clerks. <hi>And

This Oyl of Prayer is
pure and unmixed Oyl, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Power of Excommunication, and
upon what frivolous occasions it is

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Third Command of
the Church is Obedience
towards their Spiritual Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
and Teachers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Let
a man so account of us as of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Christ, and Stewards of the
Mysteries of God:</hi> which is a Text
that they often repeat in their
Churches, and raise consequences
from thence of the sublimity of
their Office, and of the reverence
and honour due from the people
toward their Clergy; so that though
they want the advantages of Riches
and Ornament to render them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
in the Eyes of the Vulgar;
yet their People being affected with
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42203:161"/>
their divine and separated Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
do not submit only in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
matters, but even in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
refer themselves to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of their Bishop, or Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,
according to that of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Dare any of you having a
matter against another, go to Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the unjust, and not before the
Saints?</hi> But that which most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces
this Duty of Obedience, is a
sense of the Power of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
which rests in the Church,
of which they so generally stand in
fear, that the most profligate and
obdurate conscience in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
startles at this sentence to which
whilst any is subjected, he is not
only expelled the limits of the
Church, but his conversation is scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
and his person denied the
common benefits of Charity and
assistance, to which Christian or
Humane duty doth oblige us.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42203:161"/>
In the Exercise of this censure
of Excommunication, the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church is so ready and frequent,
that the common use of it might
seem to render it the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible;
but that the Sentence is
pronounced with so much horrour,
and the sad effects which have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
thereupon, not only to the
living, but also to the Corps and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casses
of such who have dyed under
Excommunication, are related with
that evidence and certainty as still
confirms in the people the efficacy
of that Authority which the Church
exercises therein. The form of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
is either expressive
of the party with his name and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
secluding him from the use
of Divine Ordinances, or otherwise
indefinite of any person who is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of such or such a Crime or Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour.
As for Example, If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
person is guilty of Theft, which is
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:42203:162"/>
not discovered, an Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is taken out against him, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he be, that hath committed
the Theft, which is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
until Restitution is made;
and so the fault is published and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
at a full Congregation, and
then follows the Sentence of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
in this form.</p>
                     <p>If they restore not to
him that which is his
own,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </note> and possess him
peaceably of it, but
suffer him to remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
and damnifyed;
let him be separated
from the Lord God Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour,
and be accursed,
and unpardoned, and
undissolvable after death
in this World, and in
the other which is to
come. Let Wood, Stones,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42203:162"/>
and Iron be dissolved,
but not they: May they
inherit the Leprosie of
<hi>Gehazi,</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of <hi>Judas;</hi> may
the Earth be divided,
and devour them like
<hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram;</hi>
may they sigh and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
on earth like <hi>Cain,</hi>
and the wrath of God
be upon their heads and
Countenances; may they see nothing
of that for which they labour, and beg
their Bread all the days of their lives;
may their Works, Possessions, Labours,
and Services be accursed; always
without effect or success, and blown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
like dust; may they have the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the holy and righteous Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
<hi>Abram, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> of
the 318 Saints who were the Divine
Fathers of the Synod of <hi>Nice,</hi> and of
all other holy Synods; and being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42203:163"/>
the Church of Christ, let no man
administer unto them the things of the
Church, or bless them, or offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for them, or give them the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
or the blessed Bread, or eat, or drink,
or work with them, or converse with
them; and after death, let no man
bury them, in penalty of being under
the same state of Excommunication,
for so let them remain until they have
performed what is here written.</p>
                     <p>The effect of this dreadful Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is reported by the <hi>Greek</hi> Priests
to have been in several instances so
evident, that none doubts or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believes
the consequences of all those
maledictions repeated therein; and
particularly, that the body of an
excommunicated person is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of returning to its first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
until the Sentence of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
is taken off. It would
be esteemed no Curse amongst us
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42203:163"/>
to have our Bodies remain uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
and entire in the Grave, who
endeavour by Art, and Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
spices, and Gums, to preserve
them from Corruption: And it is
also accounted, amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi>
themselves, as a miracle and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
grace and favour of God to
the Bodies of such whom they have
Canonized for Saints to continue
unconsumed, and in the moist
damps of a Vault, to dry and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siccate
like the Mummies in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
or in the Hot sands of <hi>Arabia.</hi> But
they believe that the Bodies of the
Excommunicated are possessed in
the Grave by some evil spirit, which
actuates and preserves them from
Corruption, in the same manner as
the Soul informes and animates the
living body; and that they feed in
the night, walk, digest, and are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished,
and have been found ruddy
in Complexion, and their Veins, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42203:164"/>
forty days Burial, extended with
Blood, which, being opened with a
Lancet, have yielded a gore as plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
fresh, and quick, as that which
issues from the Vessels of young and
sanguine persons. This is so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
believed and discoursed of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that there is
scarce one of their Country Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
but what can witness and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
several instances of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
both by the relation of their
Parents, and Nurses, as well as of
their own knowledge, which they
tell with as much variety as we do
the Tales of Witches and Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
of which it is observed in
Conversation, that scarce one story
is ended before another begins of
like wonder. But to let pass the
common and various Reports of the
Vulgar, this one may suffice for all,
which was recounted to me with
many asseverations of its truth, by
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42203:164"/>
a grave <hi>Candiot Kaloir,</hi> called <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronio,</hi>
a Preacher, and a person of
no mean repute and learning at
<hi>Smyrna.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I knew, (said he) a certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who for some misdemeanours
committed in the <hi>Morea,</hi> fled over
to the Isle of <hi>Milo,</hi> where though
he avoided the hand of Justice, yet
could not avoid the Sentence of
Excommunication, from which
he could no more fly, than from
the conviction of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
or the guilt which ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
him; for the fatal hour of
his death being come, and the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Church not revoked,
the Body was carelesly and without
Solemnity interred in some retired
and unfrequented place. In the
mean time the Relations of the
deceased were much afflicted, and
anxious for the sad estate of their
dead Friend, whilst the <hi>Paisants</hi>
                           <pb n="280" facs="tcp:42203:165"/>
and <hi>Islanders</hi> were every night af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
and disturbed with strange
and unusual apparitions, which they
immediately concluded arose from
the Grave of the accursed Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant,
which, according to their
Custom, they immediately open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and therein found the Body
uncorrupted, ruddy, and the Veins
replete with Blood: The Coffin
was furnished with Grapes, Aples
and Nuts, and such fruit as the
Season afforded: Whereupon,
Consultation being made, the <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loires</hi>
resolved to make use of the
common Remedy in those cases,
which was to cut and dismember
the Body into several parts, and to
boyl it in Wine, as the approved
means to dislodge the evil Spirit,
and dispose the body to a dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But the friends of the deceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
being willing and desirous that
the Corps should rest in peace, and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:42203:165"/>
some ease given to the departed
Soul, obtained a Reprieve from the
Clergy, and hopes, that for a sum
of Money, (they being persons of
a competent Estate) a Release might
be purchased from this Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
under the hand of the
Patriarch: In this manner the
Corps were for a while freed from
dissection, and Letters thereupon
sent to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
That in case the Patriarch
should condescend to take off the
Excommunication, that the day,
hour and minute that he signed
the Remission should be inserted
in the Date. And now the Corps
were taken into the Church, (the
Country-people not being willing
they should remain in the Field) and
Prayers and Masses daily said for
its dissolution, and pardon of the
Offender: When one day after
many Prayers, Supplications and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:42203:166"/>
Offerings (as this <hi>Sofronio</hi> attested
to me with many protestations)
and whilst he himself was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Divine Service, on a sudden
was heard a rumbling noise in the
Coffin of the dead party, to the
fear and astonishment of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
then present; which when
they had opened, they found the
Body consumed and dissolved as
far into its first Principles of Earth,
as if it had been seven years in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred.
The hour and minute of
this dissolution was immediately
noted and precisely observed, which
being compared with the Date of
the Patriarchs release, when it was
signed at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> it was
found exactly to agree with that
moment in which the Body return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to its Ashes.</q> This story I should
not have judged worth relating, but
that I heard it from the mouth of a
grave person, who says, That his
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:42203:166"/>
own eyes were Witnesses thereof;
and though notwithstanding I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
it a matter not assured enough
to be believed by me, yet let it serve
to evidence the esteem they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the validity and force of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.
I had once the
curiosity to be present at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Grave of one lately dead,
who, as the people of the Village
reported, walked in the night, and
affrighted them with strange Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasmes;
but it was not my fortune
to see the Corps in that nature, nor
to find the Provisions with which
the spirit nourishes it, but only such
a Spectacle as is usual after six or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
days Burial in the Grave; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<hi>Turks</hi> as well as <hi>Christians</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of these matters with much
confidence.</p>
                     <p>This high esteem and efficacy
being put on Excommunication,<note place="margin">Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions granted on every trivial occasion.</note>
one would believe that the Priests
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:42203:167"/>
should endeavour to conserve the
reverence thereof, being the Basis
and main support of their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and that therefore they should
not so easily make use thereof on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
frivolous occasion; that so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
might not render it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
and the salvation of mens
Souls not seem to be played with
on every slight and trivial Affair:
But such is the much to be lamented
poverty in this Church, that they
are not only forced to sell Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
but the very Sacraments;
and to expose the most reverend
and mysterious Offices of Religion
unto sale for maintenance and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the Priesthood.</p>
                     <p>The taking off Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
after death hath been usual, but
the Excommunicating after death
may seem a strange kind of severity;
for so we read that <hi>Theodosius,</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> excommunicated
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:42203:167"/>
                        <hi>Origen</hi> two hundred years after his
decease.</p>
                     <p>On the same Authority of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication

of the Penitent with the Oyl
of Chrism, or the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

from the ways of darkness and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
sins.</p>
                     <p>But of such who in riper years
fall away from the Faith (as many
<hi>Greeks</hi> do for the sake of Women,
or escape of punishment) their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admission
or reception again into
the Church is more difficult; for to
some of them there is enjoined a
Penance of six or seven years hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
themselves with extraordinary
Fasts, and continual Prayer; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time they remain in the
nature of <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> without the
use or comfort of the Eucharist, or
Absolution, unless at the hour of
death; in which the Church is so
rigorous, that the Patriarch himself
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:42203:168"/>
is not able to release a Penance of
this nature, imposed only by a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Priest; and for receiving Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of this nature there is a set
Form or Office in the <hi>Greek</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy.</p>
                     <p>But now we have few Examples
of those Apostates who return from
the <hi>Mahometan</hi> to the <hi>Christian</hi> faith;
for none dares own such a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
but he who dares to dye for it;
so that that practice and admirable
part of Discipline is become obso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete
and disused. Yet some there
have been, even in my time, both
of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
who have afforded more He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
Examples of Repentance, than
any of those who have tryed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by the Rules and Canons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed;
for after that they denyed
the Faith, and for some years have
carried on their heads the Badge or
distinction of a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> feeling
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:42203:169"/>
some remorses of Conscience, they
have so improved the same by the
sparks of some little grace remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that nothing could appease or
allay the present torment of their
minds, but a return to that Faith
from whence they were fallen. In
this manner, having communicated
their anguish and desires to some Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
or grave person of the Clergy,
and signifying withal their Courage
and Zeal to dye for that faith,
which they have denyed; they have
been exhorted, as the most ready
expiation of their sin, to confess
Christ at that place where they have
renounced him; and this they have
resolutely performed by leaving off
their Tulbants, and boldly presenting
themselves in publick Assemblies and
at the time of publick prayers in the
Church: and when the <hi>Turks</hi> have
challenged them for having revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or relapsed again from them,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:42203:169"/>
they have owned their Conversion,
and boldly declared their resolution
to dye in that old Faith wherein they
were baptized; and, as a Token or
Demonstration hereof, being carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before the Justice of the City or
Province, they have not only by
words owned the Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
but also trampled their <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish</hi>
Tulbants or Sashes under their
Feet, and withstood three times the
demand, whether they would still
continue to be <hi>Mahometans,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as is required in the <hi>Mahometan</hi>
Law: For which, being condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to dye, they have suffered death
with the same chearfulness and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
that we read of the Primitive
Martyrs, who daily Sacrificed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for the Christian Verity.</p>
                     <p>Considering which, I have, with
some astonishment, beheld in what
manner some poor <hi>English</hi> men, who
have fondly and vilely denyed the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42203:170"/>
faith of Christ in <hi>Barbary</hi> and the parts
of <hi>Turky,</hi> and become, as we term
them, <hi>Renegados,</hi> have afterwards
(growing weary of the Customes of
<hi>Turks</hi> to which they were strangers)
found means of escape, and returned
again into <hi>England,</hi> and there entered
the Churches, and frequented the
Assembly of Gods people, as boldly
as if they had been the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and faithful of the Sheepfold:
At which confidence of ignorant
and illiterate men, I do not so much
admire, as I do at the negligence of
our Ministers, who acquaint not the
Bishops herewith, to take their Counsel
and Order herein: But perhaps they
have either not learned, or so far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
the ancient Discipline of ours, and
all other Christian Churches, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
men, after so abominable a Lapse
and Apostasie, boldly to intrude into
the Sanctuary of God with the same
unhallowed hands, and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:42203:170"/>
mouths, with which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
their Saviour and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
But what can we say hereunto?
Alas! Many are dissenters from our
Church; which, by our divisions in
Religion, hath lost much of its Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
Discipline and esteem amongst
us; and men, being grown careless
and cold in Religion, little dream or
consider of such methods of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
for whilst men contemn
the Authority, and censures of the
Church, and disown the power of
the Keys, they seem to deprive
themselves of the ordinary means of
Salvation, unless God, by some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
light and eviction, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
that in a sublimer manner,
which was anciently effected by a
rigorous observation of the Laws
and Canons of the Church.</p>
                     <p>It is a strange Vulgar Errour that
we maintain in <hi>England,</hi> that
the <hi>Greek</hi> Church doth yearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate

nothing so; and common reason
will tell us, That a Church cannot

no more than it owns a subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

I attest to be so, upon enquiry made
into the truth thereof, and on Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of <hi>Greek</hi> Priests eminent
and knowing in the Canons and
Constitutions of their Church:
Though we cannot deny but that
anciently one Patriarch might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce

the sick a draught of consecrated

or some other odoriferous Herb,
blessed with the touch of a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix,

as well operative for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:42203:173"/>
of the Soul, as conducing to
the health of the Body. But in case

of that Water which was consecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

and some Prayers, proper for
that occasion, are rehearsed, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with such Chapters and Verses
out of the new Testament which
relate to the resurrection of the
dead. It is likewise usual amongst
them, as in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to
make Vows upon recovery; and
on the Altar to tender the form of a
Leg, Arm, or Eyes, or some other
Member ill-affected in Silver or
Gold, in remembrance and gratitude
for the late mercy of Almighty God.
But when the party dyes, the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
which they make are most
barbarous. For after his eyes are
shut, his Corps are clothed in its best
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:42203:173"/>
Apparel, and, being stretched on the
Floor with a Taper at the head, and
another at the feet, then begins the
Scene of sorrow: the Wife, the
Children, and the rest of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Friends entring with their
Hair dishevelled, their Garments
loose and torn, pulling their Locks,
and beating their Breasts, and
scratching their Faces with their
Nails</p>
                     <q>—Faedantes unguibus ora.</q>
                     <p>make such deep sighs and sad cryes,

with a Crucifix on the Breast, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Priests, and Deacons, is
carried to burial, and the Prayers
solemnized with Incense, that God
would receive his Soul into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the blessed; the Wife fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:42203:174"/>
her departed Husband, with
such passion to perform the last of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

with violence of her shreeks to force
out her own Soul, and to bear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with the Corps of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
in his Cave of darkness: And
where passion is not found so vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and violent in its representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of sorrow, by reason of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and more even temper of some
Wives; there want not Women,
who are perfect Tragedians, that
are hired to follow the Corps of the
dead, and to act in behalf of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
all the distracted postures,
and motions of real grief and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
sorrow. The Corps being
placed in the Church, and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for the dead being ended, the
Friends which accompany it first kiss
the Crucifix on the Breast, and
then the Mouth, and Forehead
of the deceased, and afterwards e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

which done, they attend them
home, and so end the Ceremonies of
Burial.</p>
                     <p>At the end of eight days after the
Burial, the friends of the deceased
make their charitable Visits to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole
with, and comfort, the nearer
Relations, and accompany them to
the Church, to joyn with them in
the Prayers offered for the quiet and
rest of the departed Soul; at which
time the men eat and drink again in
the Church, whilst the Women renew
their barbarous lamentations with
shreeks and cryes, and with all other
evidences of distraction and sorrow;

the <hi>Greek</hi> Church holds concerning
the condition of Souls departed this
life,<note place="margin">The Opinion of the Greeks touching the state of Souls after death.</note> there is some diversity, being
a matter not clearly determined by
Councils. Howsoever the <hi>Anatolian</hi>
Confession, which is generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
and approved by the <hi>Greek</hi>
Divines, doth clearly and expresly
maintain this Doctrine, That the
Souls, so soon as they are cleared
and loosed from the Fetters of the
Body, go either to Heaven or to Hell;
the first hath the name of Paradise,
<hi>Abraham's</hi> Bosom, the Kingdom of
Heaven, where the Saints sit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede
for those who are on Earth,
in honour of whom are daily sung
Hymns of praise and glory.</p>
                     <p>Such as go to Hell, called the
Grave, the eternal Fire, the Bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Pit, and the like, are of two
sorts. The first are such who dye
in the state of Divine anger, on whom
are immediately imposed Chains,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:42203:176"/>
and Fetters, which can never be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off, nor loosed to all Eternity.
The second are such who enter or
are introduced into the Mansions of
Hell, without those Bonds, Fetters,
Pains and Torments, which for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
enslave and afflict the damned;
but departing this life with disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to Justice, Repentance, and a

of Confession and Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

only the Prayers of the Saints on

of frequent Sacrifices with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Blood, with the intercession of
the Blessed Martyrs, and Church
triumphant, open the doors of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise
to languishing and wishing
Souls: but this is not done, until
the Judgment of the last day, in
which <hi>interim</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Church
holds, That neither the Sentence of

the four Patriarchs, nor the Decrees
of the Universal Synod, nor all the
Bishops of the whole World assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
are able by their Autority,
Bolles or Indulgences, to prescribe a
time for release of one Soul from
the confines of Hell; only the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God, who vouchsafes to
be moved by the Prayers of the
Church, can sign this release and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
at what time he shall think fit:
And that as the Blessed receive not
their repletions of Glory in Heaven
until after the day of Judgment, so
neither shall the Damned their full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Torment in everlasting
flames: By which it appears, that
the Tenents of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church
are in this point;</p>
                     <p>First, that the Repository of long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Souls is not locally different
from Hell it self: Secondly, that they
endure no other punishment than
only the sence of deprivation from
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:42203:178"/>
God and Heaven, and are not purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Fire and Flames: And thirdly,
that no Indulgences nor Pardons of
all the Patriarchs, or of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Bishop, can by their Autority
remit one moment of detention to
the imprisoned Souls, farther than
as they are Members of the Church
Militant, by whose Prayers and good
works only those Souls find ease and
benefit; and this is the true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

the power of tying the Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Knot, of blessing the Parties,
and of giving, or granting rules
and limits thereunto.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Greek</hi> Church, retaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these days many of the Precepts
and Laws of ancient severity and
mortification, used in the Primitive
times of Christianity, forbids and
declares unlawful the fourth Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
for though they are subject
to the <hi>Turks,</hi> with whom <hi>Polygamie</hi>
                        <pb n="306" facs="tcp:42203:179"/>
is allowable, yet they do not only
disapprove it as dissentaneous to the
Christian Religion, but likewise as a
matter undecent, and savouring too
much of the Flesh and sensuality of
Concupiscence. For a man after he
hath buried his first Wife, and taken
a second, and being deprived of that
also hath proceeded to the embraces
of a third, the Church is so far sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied;
but gives a stop here, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that where death hath three times
made a separation from the Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Bed, there ought a limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be set unto farther proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
that so the Widower may la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and condole the unhappiness of
so many deprivements; and, having
proved the troubles and importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Flesh, may find time and
leisure for Prayer and Repentance.</p>
                     <p>The reason that the <hi>Greeks</hi> give
why the fourth Marriage is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
is because it would come under
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:42203:179"/>
the notion of <hi>Polygamie,</hi> which hath
been forbidden by the Civil and
Ecclesiastical Laws of Christians;
for they understand <hi>Polygamie</hi> to be
a Conjunction of divers Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
in number, which is not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
until a person proceeds unto
a fourth Wife, which makes more
than one Copulative in the rule of
Marriage; but this allegation is so
frivolous and unsatisfactory, that I
cannot understand the nicety, and
therefore rather believe that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
was grounded on the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Customs of the Church, when
mortifications were more in use,
and all luxurious indulgence to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality
generally condemned and out
of fashion; as appears by the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of S. <hi>Augustine, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 18.
<hi>de doct. Christ. &amp; lib.</hi> 16. <hi>contra Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                           </gap>;</hi>
against which also S. <hi>Jerom</hi> in
his Epistles so much inveighs; that
he stiles the second Marriage little
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:42203:180"/>
better than Fornication; what cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
then is it likely that he would
pass on the fourth or fifth Marriages;
and herein hath been great variety
of Opinions in former Ages; as
<hi>Socrates Schol.</hi> saith <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 21. The
<hi>Novatians</hi> in <hi>Phrygia</hi> allow not of
a second Marriage, such as inhabit
<hi>Constantinople</hi> do neither receive nor
reject it; again, such as are in the
<hi>Western</hi> parts of the World admit
it wholly: the Original Authors of
so great diversity were Bishops, who
governed the Churches at divers and
at several times.</p>
                     <p>How strict soever this Church is
esteemed in admitting many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Marriage,<note place="margin">The <hi>Greek</hi> Church easie to grant divorces.</note> that is of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
farther than to the fourth
Marriage, yet through corruption
and poverty of the Clergy, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of that Knot is with much
more facility obtained, so that it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
for a man to take out a Divorce
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:42203:180"/>
from the Patriarch, and to marry
another Woman; and the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
afterwards to alter his Sentence,
and enjoyn the Party to reassume his
first Wife, leaving the ignorant
soul as well confused in his love
as in his Conscience. The reason
hereof is rather Ignorance in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
than the Authority of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Canon whereby such a liberty
is dispensed; for the Metropolites,
as well as the Priests, being mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
poor, their Divorces, as well
as Excommunications, are made
vendible, from whence yearly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues
a considerable benefit to the
Church; and perhaps also this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
may the more easily be indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in imitation and complyance
with the Government under which
they live.</p>
                     <p>The Ceremonies used at their
Marriages are some of them serious
and significant, and others too light
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:42203:181"/>
and frivolous for so considerable
and important a part of Religion;
for though their Prayers and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
at this Service are holy, and full
of apt and Divine Expressions, and
the use of the Ring is very decent
and becoming; but the changing
of Garlands from the Bridegroom
to the Bride, the giving them Wine
and sugared Confects in a Spoon,
and tying them with a Garter, and
rocking them together, are Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
and Toys which seem too
mean and low, and not aptly fitt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to an Institution so serious and
and important as this.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Greeks,</hi> being a people of a
merry and sanguine complexion,
are wanton and unconstant in their
Amours; so that it is usual (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other Nations) for them to
make Addresses to one Mistress, and
pass to the Marriage of another;
for which they commonly give
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:42203:181"/>
their <hi>Sponsalia</hi> first, which is the Ring,
in token of their contract. Such
as inhabit in or about <hi>Constantinople,
Smyrna,</hi> and other Capital Cities,
look high, and would be a little
great, and therefore imitate the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of the <hi>Turks</hi> in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
keeping up their Daughters,
with the same retirement and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
from the view of men, as
if their eyes were able to pollute
and deflower them, calling them
Jewels which are not to be seen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their price and bargain is made;
so that the Bridegroom, agreeing
on the terms, prepares the Nuptials,
invites the Guests, before he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with his Bride by any other
Relation, than such as he receives
from the information of his Female
Friends, who for this discovery have
made her visits, frequented the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Bath with her, to whose
judgment and fancy he submits his
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:42203:182"/>
own, and becomes perfectly ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
by the praises they give her;
for any other assurance of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or affections, or harmony of her
humour with his, there can be none
until after the Service of Marriage
is passed: When the Parents and
Friends conduct the Bride into the
Nuptial Chamber, where having
sate for a short space in company of
the Female Guests with her Face co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
as before at the time of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
the Bridegroom enters, and
with a trembling hand lifts up the
Vail, and kisses her, being forced to
remain content with his Fortune
whether of beauty, or deformity,
good nature, or evil disposition,
which oft-times produces a too late
repentance.</p>
                     <p>But the familiarity between the
<hi>Greeks</hi> of the Islands of <hi>Archi-pelago</hi>
admits not of these niceties,<note place="margin">The Islanders of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent humour.</note> their
conversation being more free, for
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:42203:182"/>
they frequent each others societies,
and, according to the jollity of their
natural temper, dance men and
Women together. During the
times of such mirth as this, the young
people often enter into Promises and
Protestations of Marriage, which
the men according to the levity and
unconstancy of their humour as
often break, but not without the
revenge of the old Mothers, who,
in vindication of the honour of their
Daughters, frequently exercise a
piece of Witch-craft which they call
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which is the tying up a man
from accompanying with any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
unless it be with her to whom
he hath faultered in his faith; which
is so usually practised, that all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in those Countries talk of it,
and the Bridegrooms complain of
the Tyranny; from which they
could in no wise be delivered, until
some means or composition hath
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:42203:183"/>
been made with the old Woman to
take off the Bond, or untye the
Knot, which debilitated and infee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
his virile inclinations.</p>
                     <p>But one thing here is very obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
and curious to be inserted:
That it hath been usual for the <hi>Turks,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Greek <hi>Women making</hi> Kabin <hi>with</hi> Turks <hi>in the</hi> Morea <hi>and</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania.</note>
especially in the parts of <hi>Greece</hi> called
now <hi>Romania,</hi> and in <hi>Turkish Rumeli,</hi>
to take <hi>Greek</hi> Women to Wife,
marrying them according to the
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Law; which Custome
was become so frequent, that the
Christian Women, little regarding
that Caution given them by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
of being unequally yoked,
freely entered into <hi>Kabin</hi> with the
<hi>Turks,</hi> and without scruple design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the fruit of their Bodies to the
service of Antichrist, and by the
infidelity of their Children, seemed
half-content to become themselves
Apostates. To prevent and remedy
which inconvenience, the Patriarchs
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:42203:183"/>
and Metropolites often consulted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
but could contribute little
to their redress, whilest the <hi>Turks,</hi>
who were masters both of their
lives and fortunes, made the bodies
of the men subservient to their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and of the Women to their
Lusts. Howsoever, of late years
the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of these Marriages to the
<hi>Muftee,</hi> proposed this Query, <hi>viz.</hi>
whether it might be lawful for a <hi>Turk</hi>
to unite himself to the Body of a
Woman which was nourished with
Swines flesh and Wine? for such
were the Christian Women: and
whether the Children born to <hi>Turks,</hi>
partaking of those abominable nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishments
from which they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
were not in their Births pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
and unfit to be made <hi>Mussel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?</hi>
The <hi>Muftee,</hi> startled a while
with the novelty of the question, and
considering seriously thereon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:42203:184"/>
That those Marriages were
not lawful for <hi>Turks.</hi> 
                        <q>Then, said
the Patriarch, such Marriages as
these, which are frequent amongst
you in <hi>Romelia,</hi> ought to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</q>
to which the <hi>Muftee</hi> assented,
and represented the Case to the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier,</hi>
who, concurring in the same
Opinion, ordered, that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
no <hi>Turk</hi> should marry a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Woman, unless she first renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Christian Faith, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the <hi>Mahometan:</hi> Which Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to the great honour of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,
gave a stop to those Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
in <hi>Romania;</hi> for the Parents
unwilling or ashamed to permit
their Daughters to abandon their
Faith for the sake and advantage of
a Husband, have conserved them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
since for the more equal and
lawful Marriages of Christians: But
whether this may not, in course of
time, cause Women to relinquish
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:42203:184"/>
their Faith which (God knows) in
that People is fixed with a tender root,
experience, in the course of time,
will best demonstrate: But this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened

                     <p>THE Liturgies of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church are in number four.
The first is of S. <hi>James</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be read in the Church by
<hi>Crispus,</hi> first Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi>
but this being five hours long and
tedious, is only used once a year;
that is, on the 23 of <hi>October,</hi> which
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:42203:185"/>
is the Festival of that Saint. The
second is of S. <hi>John Chrysostom;</hi> the
third of St. <hi>Basil;</hi> and the fourth of
S. <hi>Gregory</hi> the great.</p>
                     <p>The Liturgy of S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> is
read every day in the year, except
<hi>Sundays</hi> in <hi>Lent, Thursday</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi>
in the holy Week, or Vigil of
<hi>Easter,</hi> and on the Festival of the
Elevation of the holy Cross, falling on
the fourteenth of <hi>September,</hi> at which
times is read the Liturgy of S. <hi>Basil,</hi>
being esteemed longer than that of
S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and therefore more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

only a Composition of Prayers for

for reception of the holy
Mysteries. Nor are the Epistle and

                           </note> But different
from this, the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
worshipped their
Idols who adored
them as Gods, and
offered incense unto
them, saying, That
Gold and Silver were
Gods, as <hi>Nebuchadne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
did. But we,
when he honour and
adore Pictures, do
not worship the
Wood, nor Colours,
but those Saints
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:42203:188"/>
whose Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

honour them with
the reverence of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
figuring in our

Saints. As when we
bow to a Crucifix, we
form in our minds
Christ hanging on
the Cross for our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to which we
encline our heads
and knees with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.
In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
when we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Image of the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> we raise our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations
unto that holy Mother
of God: We bow our heads and
knees to her, and pronounce her
blessed above all men or Women.
The same may be said of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Angel
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:42203:188"/>
                           <hi>Gabriel;</hi> by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that this is not the same Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
which we offer unto God. Nor
do those of the Orthodox Faith
allow of the graven Workmanship
of Images to the life, but only the
Countenances of Saints, whose
persons they represent. For as the
Cherubims, over-shadowing the
Ark of the Covenant, did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
those true Cherubims in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
which remain in the presence
of God, and were honoured and
adored by the <hi>Israelites</hi> without
transgression of that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And when the Children of
<hi>Israel</hi> worshipped the Tabernacle
of the Covenant, and lodged it
with decent and due honour, they
committed no sin, nor made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid
the Commands of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
but rather declare that God
is wonderful in his Saints. Only it
is requisite that the Image have
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:42203:189"/>
some lively resemblance of the
Saint it represents, that the mind of
him that prayes may be the more
easily affected thereby. And for
the better confirmation of the
worship of holy and sacred Images,
the Church of God in the Seventh
Universal Synod, hath anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
all such as do oppose them,
and hath authorized and for ever
established the adoration of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Images, as appears in the
Ninth Canon of that Synod.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hereby it is evident what Opinion
the <hi>Greek</hi> Church holds concerning
the use of Pictures in Churches,
which whilest they pretend to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
from Antiquity and the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a Synod, though of late
date, and later received amongst
them, they despise the Sentence of
their great Doctor and Father St.

Nor
can this be understood of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

a little before, that this perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
was of a different nature to
those in past times, when the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
tormented the Professors of
Christianity: But now those that
bear the glorious name of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
condemned the others to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
to Flames, to Prison, and
all kind of Torments, for no other
Crime than for observance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Primitive Tradition.

By which
it is evident, That <hi>Arianism</hi> in those
days prevailing, Christian Hereticks
were then the Persecutors both for
the enforcement of the Doctrine of
<hi>Arius,</hi> and the worship of Images.
And howsoever the <hi>Greeks</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
and moderate their terms in
the worship of Pictures, in which, to
speak indifferently, their Churches
do not much abound, there being
seldom other Pictures which adorn
their Walls, or Portals of their
Chancels, than the representation
of our Saviour, the Blessed Virgin,
S. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel, and S.
<hi>George;</hi> to which, though they
yield much reverence, yet they are
not so apt to attribute the power of
working Miracles unto them, as they
are in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
which, considering the
scandal which Pictures and Images
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:42203:190"/>
in the Oratories, and places of Gods
worship, administer to <hi>Turks, Jews,</hi>
and other Enemies of the Gospel in
the Eastern parts; it were better that
they were wholly taken away, for they
not being capable to comprehend the
niceties of distinction in Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
which the Schools and subtile
men have formed to clear themselves
in this case from the imputation of
Idolatry, reproach the Professors of
the Christian Faith with the Infamy
of that irrational sin, which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
first preached against, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
and have thereby taken
that Offence, as may with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be believed hath in these latter
days affrighted many from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
the Gospel. And though
the <hi>Greeks</hi> would seem to use some
caution herein, by not painting Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
to the life, or not using en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
Images, or by not drawing
them farther than to the Waste with
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:42203:191"/>
an ill-favoured sort of flat painting,
as if they would thereby excuse the
inconvenience which may be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted:
Yet certainly the use of them
is so scandalous amongst <hi>Turks,</hi> (who
have scarce any thing good in their
Religion, but that they profess one
God, and are Enemies to Idolatry,)
that though Pictures and Images
may be allowed indifferently in
other Churches; yet being no es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential

ought wholly to be rejected and
wiped out in <hi>Turkey</hi> and all the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern</hi>

none remains subjected to Christian

Peace concluded between <hi>Venice</hi> and
the G. <hi>Signor,</hi> they are all annexed
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:42203:195"/>
to the Dominions of the <hi>Turk,</hi>
to whom they pay a yearly <hi>Harach</hi>
or Poll-money, which is four Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<hi>per</hi> head, whereas in the time of

                     <p>The <hi>Turk</hi> looking on the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of those Isles like out-lying
Deer lodged without pale or defence,
and rather such, who afford har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and succour to Pyrates and
Enemies, than strength or Riches
to the Borders of his Empire, hath
of late entered into consultation for
dispeopling those Islands, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
the Inhabitants into more
secure Enclosures, where they may
render greater benefit and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to their Grand Landlord, than
they do at present; but as yet no
resolution hath been taken therein.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> are greatly divided in
their Religion, and consequently
alienated each from other in their
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:42203:195"/>
humour and inclinations, some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
the Patriarchal See at
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> some at <hi>Rome.</hi> It is
not to be doubted but that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi>
possessing most of Wit and
Money, are always too hard for the
Ignorance and Poverty of the <hi>Greeks;</hi>
by which, and the convenient short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Latin Mass, they draw
many of the <hi>Greeks</hi> from atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on their own tedious Services
to better ordered and more easie
Devotions; though as yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perswade them to renounce their
obedience to their Church and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch.
Moreover whilest the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
exercised an Authority over
many of these Islands, which was
before they were constrained to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them to the <hi>Turk,</hi> the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> enjoyed an opportunity of
fixing a deep Foundation for that
Religion, and thereby so far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached
into the possessions of the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:42203:196"/>
                        <hi>Greeks,</hi> that their Religion remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under great discouragements,
their Rites being suppressed in all the
Isles of that Sea for want of prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and redress of their aggrievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
until the <hi>Greek</hi> Bishop, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolite
of <hi>Scio,</hi> called <hi>Ignatius Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochori,</hi>
in the year 1664, being a
person of an active Spirit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by his Adversaries to be of a
proud and haughty disposition, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to Covetousness, and versed
in crafty and subtle Arts, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to buckle with the Power and
Jurisdiction of the <hi>Latines.</hi> To ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
which, he at first cunningly
suggested to the <hi>Turks</hi> the danger of
that people by reason of their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and affinity with the <hi>Venetians,</hi>
and constant correspondence with
the Enemies of the <hi>Turk,</hi> hoping
that this Argument might be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to procure the bannishment of
all the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, and that others
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:42203:196"/>
of the same Sect, terrifyed with the
thoughts of loosing their Estates,
and the Country in which they were
born, might be forced to an adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to this Church, and to an
acknowledgment of the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite's
Jurisdiction. To effect which
Design the better, the Bishop asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
to himself a <hi>Greek</hi> Priest, a
man of no mean Capacity, and well
practised in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Law and
Language, and so well acquainted
with the great men amongst the
<hi>Turks,</hi> that the <hi>Latines</hi> gave him the
Nick-name of <hi>Papas Mustapha.</hi> To
help which design forward, the
<hi>Greek</hi> Church at <hi>Scio</hi> happened at
that time to be indebted to certain
great men about the Court, to whom
speedy payment was promised with
an unconscionable Interest, if the
Revenue of the <hi>Latine</hi> Diocess were

with which benefit these Unbelievers

the justice of the Cause, obtained

without particular License of
the <hi>Greek</hi> Metropolite.</item>
                           <item>3. That no Priest of the <hi>Latine</hi>

                           <item>4. That the Metropolite, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his Command, should take

Churches which belonged to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>5. That the <hi>Latine</hi> Bishop should
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:42203:197"/>
render an Account to the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite
of all the Proffits that he hath
made since his entry into that Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
and having surrendred and
made satisfaction, he should depart
and commit the Charge of his
Flock to the Government of the
<hi>Greek</hi> Metropolite. These matters
being of high concernment, and
seeming intollerable to the <hi>Latines</hi>
at <hi>Scio,</hi> they with great Fury unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
resolved to loose or hazard
all, rather than to subject themselves
to the Tyranny of another Church.
Wherefore the Bishop, with ten o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
appointed by publick Election
to attend him, departed towards
<hi>Adrianople,</hi> venting many menacing
Speeches and flourishes of their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to be revenged on the <hi>Greek</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolite.
These took their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
by way of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
with others of the same Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to try in what manner the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:42203:198"/>
Patriarch stood affected to these
Practices. The Metropolite on the
other side thought it not time to sit
longer quiet, and therefore speedily
hastned to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> well knowing
that the first complaint hath the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and commonly takes the
best impression with the <hi>Turks;</hi> to
obtain which, he proceeds directly,
and arrives before his Adversaries;
during which time he so dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
represented the evil inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Latine</hi> Church to the
Welfare of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire,
their Correspondence with <hi>Rome</hi>
and <hi>Venice,</hi> their Designs to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
the <hi>Greek</hi> Church from <hi>Scio,</hi> and
make the whole Island <hi>Latine,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
which, by force of great Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
of Money from several
parts of <hi>Christendom,</hi> they had made
so considerable a progress, that by
reason of the poverty of the <hi>Greeks</hi>
they had bought the best part of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:42203:198"/>
those Churches, which for many
years and Ages had been appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
to their Rites and Religion:
To which Insinuations, and others
of the like nature, the <hi>Turks</hi> lent an
Ear with singular attention, who
have always found, That the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
amongst Christians have ever
concluded with gain and benefit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them; especially to the <hi>Chimacam,</hi>
called <hi>Kara-Mustapha Pasha,</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
well qualified to manage an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue
of this kind to the best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
blessed and welcomed the
opportunity, designing to improve
the business to the best that he was
able. And therefore, as if the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Crime had been no less than
Treasonable on the side of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi>
he dispatched Commands in
a <hi>Turkish</hi> Fury to bring them to
<hi>Constantinople.</hi> The Bishop being
advertised hereof, whilest he was on
his way to the Court, made the more
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:42203:199"/>
haste in By-ways, lest he should fall
into the hands of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers:
Howsoever, as soon as they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> as men already
convicted, were committed to a
severe Imprisonment, lying for the
space of fifteen days and nights with
one Leg in the Stocks, and the other
in Chains. But this rigour was not
exercised on the <hi>Latines</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to the <hi>Greek</hi> Cause, but only as
the most expedite means to extort
Money, that so they might both
buy their Liberty, and obtain that
the Tryal of their Cause might be
referred to the legal and ordinary
course of Justice. The <hi>Chimacam</hi>
had likewise well squeezed the <hi>Greeks</hi>
and extracted from them no less
than 4000 Dollars on promise of
favour to their Cause and Interest,
by punishing their Adversaries; in
which, conceiving that he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
moderately complyed and well
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:42203:199"/>
deserved the Money from the <hi>Greeks</hi>
he proceeded to exact other 7000
Dollars from the <hi>Latines;</hi> and so,
being by this time indifferently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
towards both Parties, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a day for judgment of the
Cause; in the Method of which
Proceedings, and in Conclusion of
this business, we shall find him to
act with the same equallity as he
hath done in all Affairs, since he hath
been promoted to the charge of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<hi>Vizier.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>The day being come, and both
sides appearing, the <hi>Greek Papas</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
furiously against the disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the <hi>Latines</hi> to the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire; and that for his own
part, though he wore the Cross,
yet he could fight under the Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moon,
with suchlike terms of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
and dissimulation. Those on
the other side vindicated themselves
of those Aspersions, making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:42203:200"/>
of their quietness and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Power under which
they lived; and next proved the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
possessions of their Churches,
most of which they enjoyed by
vertue of their Capitulations, and
the rest by Title of purchase, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by a long tract of time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the term of any prescription.
The <hi>Chimacam</hi> having been molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by both parties, gladly carried
an even and moderate hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
both; and therefore, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
to neither party, adjudged
some of those Churches to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines;</hi>
and as if the Title to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
had been more intricate and
different, he referred the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
thereof to the <hi>Pasha</hi> and
<hi>Kadi</hi> of <hi>Scio;</hi> giving the <hi>Greeks</hi> a
Command under-hand, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
that what Churches had
not remained in the possession of the
<hi>Latines</hi> for above 60 years, should,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:42203:200"/>
notwithstanding all Reasons to the
contrary be adjudged again to the
right of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
both parties setting forward on
their Journey as contented and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorius
to <hi>Scio,</hi> with equal hopes of
success; being there arrived, soon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
and joyned issue together
before the <hi>Pasha.</hi> But the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polite
producing his Command, of
which his Adversaries had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or suspition, Sentence was
given according thereunto; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the <hi>Latines</hi> were deprived of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
60 Churches. And this was
the issue for that time of this Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
between Christians, who in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religious and Ecclesiastical
Concernments, sought Justice from
the determination of <hi>Turks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides this difference,<note place="margin">A diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Latines</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
                        </note> others have
arisen of later standing and date;
but we shall only instance in that
one, which is very remarkable, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:42203:201"/>
at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> about the time
of <hi>Easter,</hi> in the year 1674. when
Monsieur <hi>de Nointel,</hi> Ambassador
for his most Christian Majesty to
the Grand <hi>Signor,</hi> had a curiosity
in his other Travels to make a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
to the Holy Sepulchre,
which having been anciently in the
hands of the <hi>Latines,</hi> at least in
equal possession of both one and
the other, was now demanded by
the <hi>Greeks</hi> as their right, and as the
true and only lawful Guardians of
that place; the which Title they
took the boldness to assert, not only
by words but by force and violence.
For some days before <hi>Easter,</hi> when
the <hi>Latines</hi> were making their usual
preparations to adorn the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,
the <hi>Greek</hi> Priests assaulted them
with Clubs, with which the <hi>Latines</hi>
being equally provided, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
such a skirmish in the Church,
maintained with zeal and fury, that
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:42203:201"/>
several both of one side and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were grievously wounded, and
one of the <hi>Greeks</hi> killed; but (as one
of the Fryars of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
told me,) that he received not
his mortal wound from them, but
that he starved himself, obstinately
refusing all sustenance, for no other
Reason than that his blood might
be required of the <hi>Latines;</hi> which he
imagined to have been of so great
import, as would cause the <hi>Latines</hi>
to be expelled the Holy Land, being
desirous in this good Cause to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
death, which he esteemed a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
for revenge of his Religion
and Country. The cause which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the <hi>Greeks</hi> to revive their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to the custody of the Holy
Sepulchre, with so much resolution
and fervour, is diversly reported.
Some say that <hi>Panaioti</hi> the Viziers
Interpreter, a Christian of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church, had through the favour of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:42203:202"/>
the Vizier obtained a <hi>Hattersheriff</hi>
for investing the <hi>Greeks</hi> solely in
possession of the Sepulchre; the
which he concealed, and laid by
him during his life time, well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the opposition and trouble
he should encounter by putting it
into execution, from the union of
all the Representatives of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Princes against him; and how
far a Contention of this nature
might proceed to the ruine of his
life and fortune, at least of his quiet,
he was too prudent and cautious to
make the Experiment; but rather
chose to conceal it until the time of
his death, when he bequeathed it
for a Legacy to the honour and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of his Church. Others say,
That <hi>Sultan Morat</hi> had granted this
<hi>Hattersheriff,</hi> which at the interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of all the Christian Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, had until now been suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and lay dormant, being only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:42203:202"/>
by this Quarrel between the
<hi>Latin</hi> Fathers and the <hi>Greek Kaloirs;</hi>
for the Vizier, to correct (as is judged.)
the insolence and presumption of
the <hi>Latines,</hi> upon the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> renewed the
rigour of the ancient <hi>Hattersheriff,</hi>
the which <hi>Dositheus,</hi> Patriarch of
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> an active, bold, and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man, put into execution with
that briskness and zeal, as highly
provoked the <hi>Latins</hi> to an extreme
heat of indignation; but their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was little available in the Case,
whilest they wanted force to right
and revenge themselves. For, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all the applications
they could make to the G. <hi>Vizier,</hi>
enforced by the strong and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arguments of Money, and by
the Instances of most of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
<hi>Ambassadors</hi> at the Court, the
<hi>Vizier</hi> remained inexorable, and not
to be moved with any Intreaty or
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:42203:203"/>
Sollicitation whatsoever. And when
the <hi>English</hi> Ambassador, about <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi>
1675. designed to make expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience how successful and powerful
his Interest might prove at Court a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Addresses of other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
he was privately advised by a
person of nearest intimacy to the
Publick Counsels, not to move in
a matter which was so ungrateful,
and which would force the <hi>Vizier,</hi>
against his Will, to give him the
first denyal of what he had demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from him. In this manner for
some years this business remained,
in which interim, Addresses were
made to the <hi>Pope</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to
the Courts of Christian Princes, for
a Remedy; but no Interest of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
or Favour could incline the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier
Ahmet Pasha,</hi> during his Life
and Government, to alter his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
or Judgment in the Case; but
now <hi>Kara-Mustapha Pasha</hi> succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:42203:203"/>
to the Government, a recovery
may probably be expected, in case
those Arguments of Money and
Presents be applyed, which had little
power on the resolution and integrity
of the <hi>Vizier</hi> deceased.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> of the Islands are men
of robustious and well-proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Bodies,<note place="margin">The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the <hi>Greek</hi> Islan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> strong and fit for War;
for which reason the <hi>Turks</hi> employ
them for <hi>Levents,</hi> or Souldiers for
Sea-service; but being Christians
they deny them the priviledge of
exercising Arms at Land. They
are a people extremely well content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their condition, and would
not change their Possessions on
their little Rocks and Isles, for all
the Antick Glory of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
where they pipe and dance
promiscuously, Men and Women
together, in despight of Enemies,
or the double Duty and Tax which
they paid in time of War to the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
                        <pb n="356" facs="tcp:42203:204"/>
on one side, and to the <hi>Turks</hi>
on the other. But since Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the G. <hi>Signor</hi> and the <hi>Venetian</hi>
is concluded, all the Isles of the
<hi>Arche-pelago</hi> are solely allotted to the
Dominion of the <hi>Turk,</hi> except the
Isle of <hi>Tino</hi> (as we have said before)
which by Articles is reserved to the
<hi>Venetians,</hi> who have there a Prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
and Castle to defend it. The
other Isles are open, having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fortresses than their little Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
and Oratories; for which cause
they are much infested by <hi>Corsaires,</hi>
or Free-booters, under the Colours
of <hi>Ligorn, Malta, Mayorca, &amp;c.</hi> to
whom these Islanders are so perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
subject in all duty and service,
that their goods are liable to their
rapine, and the bodies of their
Wives and Daughters to their lusts.
Notwithstanding which, these poor
people rejoice in their homes, and
can dispense with all inconveniences,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:42203:204"/>
rather than abandon their beloved
rocks; so powerful is that affection
which every one bears to his own
Country: But the entertainment
which these Islands afford the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saires,</hi>
hath so far moved the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the <hi>Turk,</hi> that (as we have
said before) he hath more than
once taken a resolution entirely to
depopulate all the open or unforti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Islands, by transporting the
people to some places on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
where their industry and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
might bring them more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and advantage; but as yet the
design hath not succeeded, though
greatly feared and sadly expected by
that miserable people.</p>
                     <p>But in no place of the <hi>Turks</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
do Christians enjoy more
freedom in their Religion and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
than on the Isle of <hi>Xio,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Xio.</note> or
<hi>Scio,</hi> to which they are entituled by
an ancient Capitulation made with
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:42203:205"/>
                        <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> the Second, to
whom they surrender'd themselves,
on Composition and Articles of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and enjoyment of their Estates,
which to this day is maintained so
faithfully, that a <hi>Turk</hi> cannot strike
or abuse a <hi>Christian</hi> without severe
Correction: Here the Men wear
Hats and Cloaths almost after the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Mode; carry the Crucifix
in procession through the Streets,
and exercise their Religion with all
freedom. This Island produces the
most excellent Mastick in the World,<note place="margin">It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the <hi>Lentis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> which in other parts of the world produces the like Gum.</note>
and I think there is no place where
it is so good, and so great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;
and herein they pay their
Tribute to the G. <hi>Signor.</hi> In this
place both the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
are professed, the chief Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of the latter sort are two, and
those of considerable esteem, <hi>viz.</hi>
the <hi>Monew, alias, Giustiniani,</hi> and
<hi>Borghesi;</hi> these latter are noble; but
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:42203:205"/>
the first have been Princes: who
having in the year 1345 been sent
thither from <hi>Liguria,</hi> or parts of
<hi>Genoua,</hi> as Governours, became af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
Supreme Lords of that
Island; which they ruled with abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Authority, until the <hi>Turk</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
as near to them as <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasia,</hi>
and having possessed himself
of that Capital City, they judged
their small City uncapable to resist,
and therefore, like the remoter parts
of <hi>Ragusi,</hi> they addressed themselves
with all humility and subjection to
demand Peace.</p>
                     <p>In honour of <hi>John Justiniani,</hi> the
last Prince of that Island, I find
a large <hi>Elogium</hi> wrote by an Abbot
of that name in <hi>Italian,</hi> who with
several Sciotical Expressions cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates
the fame of the <hi>quondam</hi> pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Prince of that Island, which in
our times hath not gain'd the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of many wise men, whence
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:42203:206"/>
comes that Proverb comon amongst
the <hi>Greeks,</hi>

that is, That a wise man is as rare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

Howsoever this place hath stoutly
engaged amongst the other Cities
and Islands in the contention of
<hi>Homer</hi>'s Birth; and this <hi>Giustiniani,</hi>
though derived originally from a
<hi>Genoese</hi> Family, was yet born at
<hi>Scio,</hi> and was a person of more than
ordinary Parts and Abilities, if we
believe that Author; who writes
in Favour of <hi>Scio,</hi> and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
of <hi>Giustiniani,</hi> whom he
praises in this manner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>John Giustiniani,</hi> a noble <hi>Genoese,</hi>
was that sacred Anchor, on whose strength
and force, the whole East laid the
stress of her Fortune; at that time when
that horrible Tempest of Arms, raised
by the ambition and treachery of impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> conspired to its Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack:
he was that shield, who whilst
he had life, covered the head and heart
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:42203:206"/>
of this Empire from a shower of <hi>Asian</hi>
Arrows, which rained from a Cloud of
most cruel war. At the first rumour
of whose most terrible preparations, by
which <hi>Mahomet</hi> threatned to throw
down the <hi>Eastern</hi> Diadem from the
<hi>Christian</hi> Head, and thereon plant
the <hi>Turkish</hi> Tulbant; this <hi>Gustiniani</hi>
prepared himself to sacrifice his life in
defence of the Grand Metropolis; to
which end he departed from <hi>Scio</hi> with
a Squadron of Vessels, his ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
and Inheritance, and as if the
Reins of fortune had remained in his
hands, he conducted his own Fleet se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
amidst 300 Sail of the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi>
which pillaged the <hi>Propontis,</hi>
and brought them safe to <hi>Constantine Paleologus,</hi>
to whom he offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
an Adventurer for glory. The
hopes of <hi>Paleologus</hi> being revived with
this succour, and finding none to whom
he might commit the defence of the
Royal City, but to <hi>Giustiniani,</hi> he
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:42203:207"/>
entirely recommended all unto his faith,
courage and conduct. <hi>And this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
afterwards proceeds,</hi> That the
<hi>Turks</hi> being astonished at so many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses,
at length discovered that this
manly defence proceeded not from the
valour of effeminate <hi>Greeks,</hi> but that
<hi>Giustiniani</hi> was the <hi>Achilles</hi> of those
Walls, and the living <hi>Palladium</hi> of
that City: but in the heat of this storm
<hi>(as this Author saith)</hi> our <hi>Giustiniani</hi>
was slain, which turned the fortune
of the day, and with the fall of this
eminent person fell the Courage of the
Defendants, and this Imperial City
into the hands of a new Tyrant. <hi>And
so much one of this Country, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
born</hi> Sciote, <hi>writes in honour
of his ancient Prince and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this manner those many Isles
in the <hi>Arche-Pelago</hi> are divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>Latine</hi>

Rites of the <hi>Greek</hi> than of the other;
and as we have said, lying open and

and violence of the strongest, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no power over the fruits of
their labours, if found out and seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by some unconscionable Pyrate:
by which it appears how happy
those Isles are which are governed
by good Laws, and defended by
their own force, under the auspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conduct of a valiant and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Prince. It hath been the project
of several ingenious and active per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Quality, who were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the <hi>Turk,</hi> to unite all those
Isles in a Confederacy or League
together, obliging themselves to be
assistant each to other, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse
of any Robbers or Forreign
Enemies, which might undertake
any thing to the prejudice of their
publick and common wellfare. And
this, as I am informed, was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:42203:208"/>
designed by the Marquess
<hi>Fleuri,</hi> a <hi>Savoyard,</hi> who crused and
traversed over all the <hi>Greek</hi> Islands
in a Ship of 60 piece of Ordnance,
and armed with 500 men, in which
progress he made singular Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the nature, situation, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
commodities, natural strength
and people of every Island: Of the
latter of which having made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
enquiry, it was brought to my
hands by a person who had a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
acquaintance with this Marquess,
which I judging to be a Curiosity
worthy observation, I have insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
here for better understanding the
present state and condition of these
Isles.</p>

under Water in the World, the
best of which are of <hi>Samos</hi> and of
<hi>Simo.</hi> One of which I saw em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in very cold Weather, on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of an <hi>English</hi> Boat, which
was sunk by a Ships side laden with
Tin and Lead, in the Port of <hi>Smyrna,</hi>
                        <pb n="368" facs="tcp:42203:210"/>
in about eight fathom of Water,
who for want of heat, rather than
breath, the Weather being very
cold in the month of <hi>January,</hi> was
forced to dive four times to fix
four Ropes to the Boat; two of
which he hooked within the Rings
of the Head and Stern, and two at
each side in the mid-ships; which he
acted very dexterously, not missing
at any time of that which he went
about. Upon discourse with him
afterwards he told me, That he was
born at <hi>Simo,</hi> where at the Age of
three or four years, his Father brought
him to the Sea, and taught him to
swim, and then to dive, which by
degrees he so well learned, with other
young Companions, that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
practise was to try who could
stay longest under the Water, in
which they are very emulous to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
because it is the sole trade of
their poor Island to cut Spunges,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:42203:210"/>
and he that is the most expert there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
gets the handsomest Wife, and
the best Portion. This man farther
informed me, That he never could
stay under Water when his Belly was
full; but that in a Morning, or at
any time of the day fasting, in warm
Weather, and in a calm Sea, he
could stay three quarters of an hour
under Water. He never heard of
Spunges dipped in Oyl to hold in
their mouths, as we vulgarly report,
nor used they any other help, than
before they dived into the Water to
fill their Lungs with as much Air as
they could draw in. If they staid
long under Water they felt a pain
in their Ears, and many times blood
issued thence, and from their Noses;
their Eyes were always open, so that
they could almost see as well under
as above the Water; and indeed I
observed that his Eyes were glazed
and burnt with the Sea, that they
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:42203:211"/>
looked like Glass, or the Eyes of
Fish. And this shall serve at present
for what we have to relate of the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Islands.</p>

                        <p>Of other Matters and Tenents held by

amongst them.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THEY earnestly deny the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Holy Ghost
from God the Son, but only
from the Father through the Son,
which they argue with more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety
than usually they do any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Controverted Point in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                     <p>They seem to retain something
which savours of ancient <hi>Gentilism,</hi>
particularly their Belief of a certain
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:42203:211"/>
holiness in some Fountains, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
miraculous operations to
Waters, and by reason of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of some Saint, to whom the
same is dedicated, in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as the <hi>Pagans</hi> did, who believed
their Fountains to be guarded by
some Nymph or Deity to whom
they were consecrated.</p>
                     <p>When they lay the Foundation
of a new Building, the Priest comes
and blesses the Work and Workmen
with Prayer, for which they have
an Office in their Liturgy, which is
very laudable and becoming Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
But when the Priest is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
the Workmen have another
piece of their own Devotion to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
which they do by killing a
Cock, or a Sheep, the Blood of
which they bury under the first stone
they lay: It is not always, but very
frequently practised, in which they
imagine that there is some lucky Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:42203:212"/>
or some spell to attract good
fortune to the Threshold; they call
it, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or Sacrifice, and therefore
I believe that this is a piece of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Heathenism.</p>
                     <p>They think it not lawful to eat
Blood, or things strangled, though
they are not very nice or scrupulous
in the examination of what Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are set before them.</p>
                     <p>The Apochryphal Books they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
for Apocryphe, and of no
greater Authority than they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
for in <hi>England,</hi> but yet
they hold that some Traditions are
of equal Authority with the written
word.</p>
                     <p>The Doctrine of Justification by
faith or good works is not a Problem
controverted amongst them, they
are not as yet it seems so far proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Polemick Learning, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that both are very necessary
to salvation, and that he whose
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:42203:212"/>
faith produces good works, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does
him whose life is buried in
notions, and arrests it self in a
bare disputation. They believe
Faith to be an active and prolifick
Grace, and that which cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in idleness, but must operate
and employ that heavenly heat it
receives from above; but whether
our Justification be beholding to
our Faith, or to our Works, or to
both together, they leave the Query
to the discussion of such, who have
more leisure, and money, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
more curiosity than the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>Monks</hi> of <hi>Greece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Those who have a Malice or Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
to any particular person, do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
bring the breadth and length
in Thread or Wood of him, against
whom they entertain Malice, to a
Carpenter or Mason, who is ready
to lay the Foundation of a house,
the which for a little money is buried
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:42203:213"/>
under one of the first stones; after
which they say the person dyes, or
at least macerates away: as the
Thread or Wood decays, which is
a most certain piece of Magick of
the ancient <hi>Gentilism.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They really believe, that on or
about the 15th day of <hi>August,</hi>
which is the day that they celebrate
the Assumption of our Blessed Lady,
that all Streams in the World retire
into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to do homage and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance
to that Grand River of <hi>Nylus,</hi>
which is the cause, as they say, of
the innundation of that Country.
And of this perswasion they are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they perceive, that in <hi>August</hi>
the Springs and Rivers are every
where low, and the <hi>Nilus</hi> full and
over-flowing its Banks, which they
attribute as a blessing to that
River, and its Country, where
the Saviour of the World and his
Blessed Mother were secured from
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:42203:213"/>
the Malice and Treachery of impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Herod.</hi> And this fond fancy the
Vulgar have taken up, not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that the <hi>Nilus</hi> overflows in
<hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> and that the Waters
decrease in <hi>August.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have now done with the History
of the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> to which I shall
only add this remarkable passage in
the Conclusion; which, though it
be a matter not more relating to
the <hi>Greeks</hi> than other Christians, or
the <hi>Turks</hi> themselves, yet treating
here of the Oriental Churches, it
may be some elucidation of the
premises, to give the Reader an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
whereby he may understand
how constant the minds of men, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the <hi>East,</hi> are to their Traditions,
and to keep up their fancy to any
ancient superstition; which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
is undoubtedly true, being
transmitted to me by a worthy and
ingenious person, residing at <hi>Aleppo.</hi>
                        <pb n="376" facs="tcp:42203:214"/>
It is well known how much the
Telesmatical Doctrine, which was
anciently the wisdom, or rather fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Learned, prevailed in the
<hi>Eastern</hi> Quarters of the World; in
imitation of which, on the 15th of
<hi>April,</hi> 1671, there was brought into
<hi>Aleppo</hi> a little Copper-Vessel of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
out of a strong imagination, that
it was endued with a Telesmatical
Vertue, to draw thereunto a sort of
Birds which feed on Locusts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called by the <hi>Arabs, Smirmar.</hi>
I have seen them every Summer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the parts of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and
<hi>Smyrna;</hi> they are about the bigness
of a Starling, and very like it in the
Bill and Legs, but of various Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
on the Head, Breast, Back,
and Wings. This Bird (as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port)
hath so shrill a note, that the
very sound of it will strike down a
thousand Locusts at a time, and are
such <hi>Acridophagi,</hi> that when they
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:42203:214"/>
come in great numbers are sufficient
to devour and destroy those vast
swarms of Locusts, which in some
years consume all the green Corn,
Grass, Herbs, and Plants in the
Country, and turn the hopes and
expectation of a plentiful Spring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a barren Autumn, and a Winters
Famine; so that to be freed of this
Plague to which the parts about <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo</hi>
are greatly subject, no more
happy or easie remedy could be
found than something endued with
a power attracting such beneficial
and useful Guests; to perform which
nothing was esteemed more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
than a certain Water fetched (as
they say) from a Pool in <hi>Samarcand,</hi>
or rather from a holy Well of the
<hi>Arabs,</hi> called <hi>Zimzam,</hi> the which
Water was not to be carried under
any Arch, unless the immediate
Arch of Heaven. This being the
Opinion of the Inhabitants of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo,</hi>
                        <pb n="378" facs="tcp:42203:215"/>
the Water was sent for and
brought into the City with great
pomp and solemnity. The proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was made at the <hi>Southern Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus</hi>
Gate, every Religion and
Sect attending in their Habits, with
the most formal Devotion imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
according to their different
Rites and Ceremonies, every Nation
bearing before them the respective
Badges of their profession, <hi>viz.</hi>
The Law, the Gospel, and the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choran,</hi>
with Songs in their mouths
according to their several Religions.
The <hi>Mahometans</hi> surpassed all the
others in the Gallantry of their
Streamers, their Prophets Banners
being near about a hundred in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
were carried by <hi>sheghs,</hi> who
bellowed most hideously, till they
foamed at the mouth, out-doing
themselves with the violent agitation
of their Spirits, being of the Order
of <hi>Kadri,</hi> whose lives and Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:42203:215"/>
we have declared in the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
State. A Dispute happened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they entered the City, between
the <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> for prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which they challenged on
the score of Antiquity, but after
a little striking, and a greater <hi>Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
afterwards, it was determined
that the <hi>Christians</hi> were the better
men, and payed most for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of their Religion. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of all sorts of people was
exceeding great, and the Pageantry
seven hours in acting; for the
Water was drawn up over the Gate,
and over all covered passages, and
finally over the Castle Walls, where
in a Mosch it was lodged with all
reverence and devotion.</p>
                     <p>This kind or species of Birds
which resort to this Country, are,
according to the Opinion of all
Sects, drawn thither by the vertue
of this Water; which though they
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:42203:216"/>
have nothing of effectual vertue in
them, yet this fancy is so strongly
rooted not only in the Vulgar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but also with those of greater
quality, that it seems to be a dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
remain of the <hi>Sabean</hi> Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>In this manner, Reader, I have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
this short discourse of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church, what is to be amended, or
added hereunto, is a work of time,
and worthy the pains and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of curious and ingenious
Travellers into those Parts.</p>

                  <p>THIS Discourse touching the
<hi>Armenian</hi> Church, may for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Reasons probably delight
thee. First, because few have wrote
thereof, and I think none so distinctly
as I have done. Secondly, because it is a
<hi>Christian</hi> Church far remote from
us, and therefore their Customs, and
Doctrines may be the more acceptable
to the curious. Thirdly, because their
Learning and Tenents are confined
within a Language peculiar to that
Nation, and known to few of the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern</hi>
Christians: Add likewise to this
difficulty an Universal Ignorance in the
<hi>Armenian</hi> Clergie, who are neither
very willing to learn themselves, nor
<pb facs="tcp:42203:218"/>
very apt to instruct others. So that
what I have here briefly delivered, is
the effect of a difficult Enquiry, and
the small fruit of much Labour; in
whatsoever therefore I come short of an
exact account of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Practice, be pleased (Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Reader) to pardon and compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
the ignorance and inability of my
Teachers, and the difficulty of my
Task; for it seems unreasonable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
more learning from the Scholar,
than what he hath been able to copy
from his Master.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE <hi>Armenian</hi> Nation being
much dispersed in many
Countries of the <hi>Turks,</hi>
through the encouragement of
Trade and Traffick, to which they
are much addicted, I have had the
opportunity of conversation and
acquaintance with many of them,
by which means, and that curiosity
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:42203:219"/>
and desire of knowledge which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
guides me, I have penetrated
as far as my leisure and abilities
would permit me, into the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
Customs, and especially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Religion of this People.</p>
                     <p>It will not be to our purpose, to
deduce their lineage from its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
or recount the various succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of their Princes in past times, or
their martial actions and fortunes
against the <hi>Romans.</hi> It is sufficient
as to their Secular and Temporal
Estates to describe them, as men
naturally of healthy, strong, and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustious
Bodies, their Countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
commonly grave, their Features
well proportioned, but of a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
and Saturnine air: On the
contrary, their Women are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ill-shaped, long-nosed, and
not one of a thousand so much as
tolerably handsom. The men are
in their humours covetous and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:42203:219"/>
to a high degree, heady, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate,
hardly to be perswaded to
any thing of Reason; being in most
things of a dull and stupid appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
unless in Merchandise and
matters of gain, and in that they
cannot or will not understand other
than what is agreeable to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
I have never read or
heard of any amongst them famous
for Poetry or Romantick Fancies;
or that they were of late years in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to the Mathematicks, or any
other Learning; but such as is their
diet, which consists of such things
as send up gross fumes to the head,
such is their temper and genius. The
<hi>Turks</hi> give them the name of <hi>Boke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gees,</hi>
and the <hi>Jews</hi> esteem them to
have been of the ancient Race of the
<hi>Amalekites,</hi> being a People whom
they envy, because they will not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
be cheated by them in their
dealings: Howsoever, I have known
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:42203:220"/>
some of these men, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
their Education in <hi>Italy,</hi> to
be well accomplished, and men of
an acute understanding, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in their behaviour. So that
some persons, who have travelled
<hi>Armenia,</hi> ascribe this heaviness of
Complexion to the air of their
Country, which is imprisoned in
the vast Woods of Mulberry-trees,
and thickned by the Vapours of their
Fens and Marshes, and Winds from
the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea; to which they add
those ungrateful steams which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the Caldrons wherein
they boil their Silk-worms; which
as they prove noxious, and in time
deadly to those who are employed
about them, so do they infuse into
the air so malignant a fume, as even
enters into the Veins of men, and
possesses them with a strange stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
and unactiveness of soul.</p>
                     <p>Their Country was conquered in
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:42203:220"/>
the year 1515, by <hi>Selimus</hi> the First,
and annexed to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
under whose Tyranny and
Oppression we are to consider the
afflictions of that Christian Church.
<hi>Armenia,</hi> whilst subjected to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire, was one and the same
Church with the <hi>Grecian,</hi> maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same Doctrine, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the patriarch of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>
for their Primate and head of
their Church, to whom the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Calcedon</hi> assigned it, as part of
his Province and Diocess, until that
afterwards differences in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

these four, either in person or by
their Substitutes, is necessary to the
Constitution or Ordination of a
Priest, which is performed as among
us by imposition of hands.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that at <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
and at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> there are those
who are called <hi>Armenian</hi> Patriarchs,
but they are titular only, made to
please and content the <hi>Turks:</hi> who
have judged it necessary and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the <hi>Armenian</hi> Faith, or rather
to their own, that patriarchs should
remain in those places; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have enjoined them to consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
such under that notion; by
which means, the <hi>Armenian</hi> Church
maintaining their Representatives
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:42203:222"/>
at that place, they may always know
from whom they may exact the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and Presents at a new Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and may charge on him all
those <hi>Avanias,</hi> or false pretences,
which they find most agreeable to
their own advantage: Otherwise,
I say, these Patriarchs are but titular,
and are in reality no other than De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
and Suffragans of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch,
as are those at <hi>Smyrna</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gora,</hi>
where Trade hath convocated
great numbers of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
or rather, they may be more
properly called Bishops under those
Patriarchs, having the name of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabet,</hi>
which in their Language sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
a Superintendent, or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer
of the Church. A married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
whilst married, cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to this dignity, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Wife dying he may be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
thereof. The Patriarchs have
for their maintenance some Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:42203:222"/>
in Land, which is augmented
by the voluntary Contributions of
the People, who every <hi>Sonday</hi> and
Holy-day bestow something of their
Alms, either more or less, according
to their devotion and ability: for
whensoever the Church is full, they
make three several Collections; the
first for <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> the second for
<hi>Etchmeasin,</hi> and the third for the
Church in which they are; and these
rounds of the Basin never fail; and
sometimes a fourth is ordered on
some emergent occasion; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if strangers be observed to attend
the Ceremony, from whom they
expect extraordinary liberality. And
in this kind of begging they are so
importunate in some poor Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
that when I have been my self
present, I have scarce had time to
disengage my hand from my Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
so nimbly the turns went about,
and so many Briefs for repair of
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:42203:223"/>
poor Churches and distressed Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
But besides these Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Duties are great which are
paid for the Ordinances of the
Church, as Baptism, Marriage, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> only Confession and the
Communion are freed from Charge,
or such Exactions: for all others
there is no set price, but men are
obliged to pay according to their
abilities, and the bargain is driven as
hard, and with as many words, and
as much noise, as this Nation doth
usually practise when they sell their
Silk, or any other Commodity. It
was before the <hi>English</hi> Nation at
<hi>Smyrna</hi> had purchased their Coeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
or place of burial for their
dead, that some of our people were
buried in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Church-yard,
but the price of six foot of ground
was so hardly obtained, that a whole
Field might have been purchased at
a cheaper rate, than a narrow Grave.
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:42203:223"/>
I have known a poor <hi>Armenian</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
could not be admitted to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
until his friends had paid 30
or 40 Dollars for the ground, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Offices and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
for the dead. And in this
manner the Clergy gain their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
who are notwithstanding
poor and miserably ignorant.</p>
                     <p>Their Fashions and Customs are
agreeable to the people of the East,
or those amongst whom they live,
whether <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Persians.</hi> They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it a sin to eat Hares, and
their Flesh is almost as abominable
to them, as Swines-flesh to a <hi>Jew</hi> or
<hi>Turk.</hi> I have asked them the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it; to which they replyed,
that a Hare was a melancholy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and therefore unwholsom;
besides it was accounted unlucky,
and portending evil to any man
who met one; and moreover that
the Female was monthly menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:42203:224"/>
and unclean: but how they
can make this good, or where, or
how they learned or observed so
much, I never could understand
from them.</p>

                     <p>THIS Patriarchal Seat is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vulgarly by the name of
<hi>Etchmeasin,</hi> but more usually
in the parts of <hi>Turkey</hi> by the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of <hi>Changlee-Chilse,</hi> or the
Church with Bells, having a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
from the Sultan to use them,
which is allowed in no other place
(that I have heard of) unless in <hi>Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,
Valachia,</hi> and Mount <hi>Athos.</hi>
It is also called <hi>Ouch Chilse,</hi> or the
three Churches, because of the
three Churches which are there
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:42203:224"/>
built in a Triangle; the first of which
(as we have said) is this <hi>Etchmeasin;</hi>
the second <hi>Rupsameh;</hi> and the third
<hi>Gayeneh.</hi> The <hi>Armenians</hi> report,
That these three Churches are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on three Rocks, placed in a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular
form, under which was a
strange hollowness, or Cavity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
in the time of Gentilism and
Idolatry, with the voices of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
Spirits or Ghosts, which
gave Answers to all Questions that
were made to them, in the same
manner as the Oracles of <hi>Delphos,</hi>
or <hi>Jupiter Haman,</hi> until such time
as <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> intending to have his
Name worshipped there, descended
from Heaven on that place, and
taking his Cross on which he suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
struck one blow therewith on
each Rock, with which they sunk
into the Ground, and thereby the
Diabolical Spirits were displaced;
for the word <hi>Etchmeasin</hi> signifies
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:42203:225"/>
one blow or stroak, and there these
three Churches were founded, which
are the highest in esteem amongst
the <hi>Armenians.</hi> They have a large
History of the other two Churches
called <hi>Rupsameh</hi> and <hi>Gayeneh,</hi> wrote
by one <hi>Acutanghios,</hi> which remains
amongst the Registers of <hi>Etchmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin,</hi>
being to this purpose: In the
time of <hi>Dioclesian</hi> the Emperour,
when a violent Persecution arose
against the Christians at <hi>Rome,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
Virgins, which had taken a
Religious Vow upon them, were
by Divine Inspiration directed to
the <hi>Eastern</hi> parts of the World, of
which <hi>Rupsameh</hi> and <hi>Gayeneh,</hi> two
Sisters and Daughters of <hi>Gohetea,</hi>
(for so they call their Father) a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Roman,</hi> were the chief, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving
first at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
they travelled thence to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
and so into <hi>Armenia,</hi> where at that
time <hi>Tyridates</hi> governed as King,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:42203:225"/>
In which long Journey forty of the
seventy dying, the other thirty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to build their Monastery,
and therein to serve God according
to the Christian Faith and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
The arrival of these new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Guests, being of the Female
Sex, was such a Novelty, as filled
all that Country with the rumour
thereof: and more particularly, the
incomparable beauty of <hi>Rupsameh</hi>
and <hi>Gayeneh,</hi> was the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
at the Court of <hi>Tyridates;</hi>
whose heart was so affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
that he sent for the two Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
supposing that the splendour
of his Court, and the greatness of
his Authority, was sufficient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
their affections and consent
to his amorous addresses: but they
having their hearts enflamed with
divine love, gave no ear to his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Courtship, but rather slighted
and contemned all the fine words
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:42203:226"/>
he could use, and the large proffers
he could make; which applications
were daily renewed to these Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Virgins, until the Prince disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be so neglected, converted
his love into hatred and fury, in
the heat of which he caused an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner
to cut off both their heads,
which being done accordingly, their
Corps were exposed in the Fields, to
be entombed in the bowels of wild
beasts.</p>
                     <p>This matter happened at that
time, when <hi>Surp Savorich</hi> (as they
call S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> who converted <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi>
to the Christian Faith) by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Tyridates</hi> was for preaching
the Gospel cast into a most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Dungeon, so damp and dark
that it was a Habitation for none
but Bats and Serpents, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>r
the space of thirteen years he was
most miraculously preserved by the
administration of an Angel, which
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:42203:226"/>
daily supplyed him with bread and
water, than which he received no
other sustenance: during which
time all the world believed that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorich</hi>
had been long dead, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in his loathsom habitation; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
at length the Sister of <hi>Tyridates,</hi>
called <hi>Castrovitught,</hi> being frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disturbed in her sleep by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
which ordered her to suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
her Brother for the releasement
of <hi>Savorich,</hi> could find no repose
until she revealed the Vision: which
seeming strange, and no other at
first than a melancholy Dream, did
afterwards upon the tryal prove
true; <hi>Savorich</hi> being found alive in
the Dungeon, and strong and
healthful: Notwithstanding which
Miracle, and the Petitions made in
behalf of <hi>Savorich</hi> by several Chief
Officers, and by his Sister in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
yet <hi>Tyridates</hi> having his heart
hardned like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> refused to
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:42203:227"/>
give license for the liberty of <hi>Savo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich;</hi>
which sin of obstinacy so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the anger of God against him,
that one day appointed for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
hunting, being in pursuit of a
wild Bore, he was on a sudden trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into the shape of a Swine,
and all his Followers into Hobgob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins
and Fairies, such as the <hi>Turks</hi>
call <hi>Gin;</hi> which metamorphosis is
something like that of <hi>Ulysses</hi> and
his Companions: This Judgment
of God Struck all the people into
such an amazement, that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
resolved to free the Saint,
begging him to pray unto God to
restore their King and Attendants to
their former shapes of Human Form.
<hi>Savorich,</hi> or S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> being released,
immediately sought for <hi>Tyridates,</hi>
and having found him, was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him with as much grace, and
in as good a fashion, as could be
expected by a person of so ill a feat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure;
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:42203:227"/>
and having prayed to God
for him, both he and all his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were transformed again to their
natural shapes: By which Miracle
all the Country of <hi>Armenia</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to the Christian Faith.</p>
                     <p>After this, <hi>Savorich</hi> was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to gather up the Bodies of <hi>Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sameh</hi>
and <hi>Gayeneh,</hi> preserved by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Miracle, and carry them to
<hi>Etchmeasin,</hi> to which place he was
conducted by an Angel, where he
buried those bodies under the two
Rocks, which are therefore now
called by their Names: which place
also being the Sepulchre of <hi>Savorich</hi>
hath added much unto that devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which the <hi>Armenians</hi> bear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                     <p>Next to this place of Devotion,
<hi>Virap,</hi> which was the Dungeon of
<hi>Surp Savorich,</hi> is most in esteem of
any in <hi>Armenia,</hi> over which they
have built a famous monastery,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:42203:228"/>
which is seated in the Country of
<hi>Ardashat,</hi> being two days journey
from <hi>Etchmeasin,</hi> and one from <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Savorich,</hi> or S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> is so
high in esteem amongst them, that
they take the account of their years
from the time of his Preaching, and
the Conversion of that Nation to
the Christian Faith, which in this
present year is reckoned to be 1128.
which answers to ours of 1679.</p>
                     <p>To these Churches they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
make their Pilgrimages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for their sanctity, in opinion of
this people, esteemed before <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
and are accounted so holy,
that before a person can be qualified
to appear in that place, he is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to prepare himself seven years
beforehand; which is performed by
a Fast or <hi>Lent</hi> of 40 days in every
one of those seven years, purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
designed for this preparation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:42203:228"/>
the usual Fasts and <hi>Lents</hi> of the
Church, and with a sole intent to
render himself worthy to receive
the benefits and endowments which
are acquired by this most accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and holy Pilgrimage. For they
say, that he who comes thus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with humility and devotion,
shall have his desires satisfied in any
gift, qualification, or blessing he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects;
unless it be Riches; for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
being the Mammon of this
World, is not to be conferred as a
spiritual happiness. But if one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
a Faculty in singing, dancing,
or agility of body, if he desires
beauty and modesty in a Wife,
wisdom, sincerity of Friends, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing else that is vertuous or
commendable; he shall be endued
with a voice like a <hi>Seraphim,</hi> be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
as an <hi>Olympick</hi> Gamester, have
a Wife as chaste as <hi>Penelope,</hi> be wife
as <hi>Solomon;</hi> and in fine, obtain any
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:42203:229"/>
one thing which he can desire, being
of good report. But in case any
one miss of these blessings, as many
do who go on these Errands (as one
may well believe) and return as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
improved as some of those do
whom we send to <hi>Paris,</hi> there is
something in the way which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
this blessing, and no doubt
but the man was either not fitly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
or had not Faith enough to
receive the blessing.</p>
                     <p>They say farther, that some of
those <hi>Pythonick</hi> Spirits, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
inhabited under the cavities
of these three Rocks, were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Christ to keep their Stations,
with intention to make them slaves
and drudges to the Monastery;
where now invisibly they wash the
Dishes, sweep the House, and do all
the Offices of good Servants; so
that the good Fathers take no care
of those homely services, for what
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:42203:229"/>
is in the day fouled and disordered
is by next morning found cleansed
and well disposed, by the ministry
and diligence of those careful and
officious Spirits. All these things
and much more is believed by the
<hi>Armenians</hi> of <hi>Etchmeasin,</hi> so easie
it is to obtrude vain and superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fancies on ignorant and illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
people.</p>
                     <p>In their Monasteries the whole
Psalter of <hi>David</hi> is read over every
24 hours; but in the Cities and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Churches it is otherwise ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
For the Psalter is divided
into eight divisions, and every divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
into eight parts; at the end of
every one of which is said the <hi>Gloria
Patri; &amp; Filio, &amp;c.</hi> Their manner of
Worship is performed after the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
fashion, by prostrating their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and kissing the ground three
times (which the <hi>Turks</hi> likewise pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
in their Prayers.) At their first
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:42203:230"/>
entrance into the Church they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
their heads, and corss them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
three times, but afterwards
cover their heads, and sit cross-leg'd
on Carpets, after the manner of the
<hi>Turks.</hi> The most part of their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Divine Service they perform in
the morning before day, which is
very commendable, and I have been
greatly pleased to meet hundreds of
<hi>Armenians</hi> in a Summer morning,
about Sun-rising, returning from
their Devotions at the Church,
wherein perhaps they had spent two
hours before, not only on Festival
but on ordinary days of work: in
like manner they are very devout
on Vigils to Feasts, and <hi>Saturday</hi>
Evenings, when they all go to
Church, and returning home per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume
their Houses with Incense, and
adorn their little Pictures with
Lamps.</p>

the Holy Ghost proceeds only from

                     <p>I have read in many Books, which
treat of this Church, an accusation
against it, that it admits but of one
Person and one Nature in Christ,
according to the Doctrine of <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi>
of which I my self was once
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:42203:231"/>
of opinion, until I read and well
considered of the Articles of their
Faith.</p>
                     <p>They believe that Christ descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into Hell, and that he freed the
Souls of all the damned from
thence, by the grace and favour of
his glorious presence, but not for
ever, or by a plenary pardon or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission;
but only as reprieved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the end of the World, at which
time they shall again be returned
unto Eternal Flames. But that we
may take a more clear view of their
Faith, I have thought fit to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
that which they call their <hi>Tava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanck,</hi>
or <hi>Symbolum,</hi> different from
the Apostles and <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, which
for those words follwing, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <q>where the Deity was mixed with the
Humanity without spot,</q> seems to
be calculated for maintenance of
the Herisie of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> and in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the Catholick Doctrine,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:42203:231"/>
as that of <hi>Athanasius</hi> is to the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
of <hi>Arrius:</hi> But these words
though they look ill at first, yet if
well considered and compared with
the same expression which the <hi>Greeks</hi>
use on the same subject, it will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
unto no more, than what
the <hi>Greeks</hi> declare in the <hi>Anatolian</hi>
Confession, <hi>That the Body of Christ
was a true not a fantastick Body, that
it was formed in the Womb of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Virgin, and was made a perfect man,</hi>

i.e. <hi>his rational Soul mixed with

their Creed are <hi>Verbatim</hi> as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                     <p>I Consess that I believe with all my
heart in God the Father uncreated,
and not begotten, and that God the
Father, God the Son, and God the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, were from all Eternity: the
Son begotten of the Father, and the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:42203:232"/>
Holy Ghost proceeds only from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I believe in God the Son increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and begotten from Eternity. The
Father is Eternal, the Son is Eternal,
and equal to the Father; whatsoever
the Father contains, the Son contains.
I believe in the Holy Ghost which was
from Eternity, not begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but proceeding, three Persons but
one God. Such as the Son as to the
Deity such is the Holy Ghost. I believe
in the Holy Trinity, not three Gods,
but one God, one in Will, in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in Judgment, Creator both
of visible and invisible. I believe in
the Holy Church, in the remission of
sins, and the Communion of Saints.
I believe that of those three persons one
was begotten of the Father before all
eternity, but descended in time from
Heaven unto <hi>Mary,</hi> of whom he took
blood, and was formed in her Womb,
<hi>where the Deity was mixed with the
Humanity without spot or blemish.</hi>
                        <pb n="413" facs="tcp:42203:232"/>
He patiently remained in the Womb of
<hi>Mary</hi> nine Months, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
born as man, with soul, intellect,
judgment, and body: Having but one
body and one countenance: And of this
mixture or union resulted one composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Person; God was made man
without any change in himself, born
without Humane Generation, his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remaining still a Virgin: And as
none knows his eternity, so none can
conceive his being or essence; for as he
was Jesus Christ from all eternity, so
he is to day, and shall be for ever.</p>
                     <p>I believe in Jesus Christ, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
in this world, and after thirty
years was baptized according to his own
good will and pleasure, his Father bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
witness of him, and said, <hi>This is
my beloved Son in whom I am well
pleased,</hi> and the Holy Ghost in form of
a Dove descended upon him, he was
tempted of the Devil and overcame,
was preached to the Gentiles, was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:42203:233"/>
in his body, being wearied, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
hunger and thirst, was crucified
with his own will, dyed corporally, and
yet was alive as God, was buried, and
his Deity was mixed with him in the
Grave; his soul descended into Hell,
and was always accompanied with his
Deity; he preached to the souls in
Hell, whom after he had released, he
arose again the third day, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his Apostles. I believe that our
Lord Jesus Christ did with his body
ascend into Heaven, and sits at the
right hand of God; and that with the
same body by the determination of His
Father, He shall come to judge both
the quick and the dead: And that all
shall rise again; such as have done
good shall go into life eternal, and such
as have done evil into everlasting fire.</p>
                     <p>This is the sum of the <hi>Armenian</hi>
Faith, which they teach their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and young Scholars, and is
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:42203:233"/>
repeated by them in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as our Apostles Creed is in our
Divine Service.</p>

                        <p>Of Fasts in the <hi>Armenian Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THEIR Fasts are the most ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
of any Nation in the
World, for as the Eastern
people have always been more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemious
in their diet, and less ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to excess in their Tables and
ordinary Banquets, than the West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
or Northern Nations; so by
this custom of living they support
more easily the severe Institution of
their <hi>Lents:</hi> who in the time of
their Feasts are not so free in their
eating and drinking, as we are in
our times of Abstinence and Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for that which we call a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:42203:234"/>
or Lenten-Table, will serve
an <hi>Armenian</hi> for an <hi>Easter</hi> Dinner.</p>
                     <p>For in the first place they observe
the Great <hi>Lent</hi> before <hi>Easter,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at the same time with the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church, following in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
the Rule ordained by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Nice,</hi> which is observed by all
the Christian World. And in this
<hi>Lent</hi> they eat not Fish with blood,
as do the Papists, nor Shell-fish, as
do the <hi>Greeks,</hi> nor yet so much as
Oyl of Olives, as being substantial,
and that which yields too much
nourishment and pleasure to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late:
only they may eat the Dregs
and Lees of the Oyl of Olives, or
the Oyl of <hi>Sousam,</hi> which is pressed
from a Seed so called in <hi>Turkish,</hi>
like our Rape-seed, the smell of
which is sufficient to overcome a
tender stomach. In which time of
mortification, they account it a sin
to accompany with their Wives,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:42203:234"/>
and perhaps they may not have
much inclination thereunto, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that at the beginning of <hi>Lent,</hi>
many of them pass three or four
days without receiving any refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
either of Bread or Water, into
their Stomachs; and perform the
like at the end thereof, not breaking
their Fasts until they eat and drink
the Sacrament on <hi>Easter-day</hi> in the
Morning: Besides which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a continued Fast through all
the days of <hi>Lent,</hi> not eating until
three of the Clock in the Afternoon,
which some call <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Fast,
and is a Custom of great Antiquity.
But <hi>Easter</hi> being come, they make
some recompence to the Body for
this long abstinence, by a permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to eat flesh till <hi>Ascension-day,</hi>
without accounting of <hi>Frydays,</hi> or
other days which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call
days of abstinence: The like indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
they have for the whole week
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:42203:235"/>
after <hi>Epiphany,</hi> but excepting these
Weeks aforesaid, they keep <hi>Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi>
and <hi>Frydays</hi> for days of absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
through the whole year. As
to their other Fasts they observe a
short <hi>Lent</hi> of nine days before the
15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> which is the Feast of
our Ladies Assumption. They have
one which begins the Week after the
Feast of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> that is, on <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
Monday,</hi> being performed in
honour to the Holy Ghost, two
Weeks after which they fast one
more on the same account; then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
two Weeks they fast one more,
then after four Weeks they fast one,
then after one Week they fast ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then after seven Weeks they
fast another, then after two Weeks
they fast one, again after three
Weeks they fast the fourth, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
days before the <hi>Epiphany</hi> they
keep a severe <hi>Lent,</hi> so that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
fast in our <hi>Christmas</hi> till <hi>Twelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi>
                        <pb n="419" facs="tcp:42203:235"/>
In which manner they mix the
whole course of the year with fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but the times seem so confused
and without rule, that they can
scarce be recounted, unless by those
who live amongst them, and strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observe them, it being the chief
care of the Priest, whose Learning
principally consists in knowing the
appointed times of fasting and
feasting; the which they never omit
on <hi>Sondays</hi> to publish unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

who keep our account according to

thereof they celebrate with great
Solemnity and Commemoration
the Birth, Epiphany, and Baptism of
our Saviour on the sixth of <hi>January,</hi>
which is our Twelf-day, the which
day they keep with high devotion;
and more especially, because they
hold that one of the Wise-men of

Prince, with whom they are so well
acquainted, that they know him by

sixth day of <hi>January,</hi> which is our
Epiphany; they observe (as we have
said) seven days of Fast, according
to their usual severity and rigour.
All their other Feasts, unless it be

                        <pb n="421" facs="tcp:42203:236"/>As to that of Epiphany it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly

note are these, That of S. <hi>John</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,
called by them, <hi>Surp Carabet,</hi>
on the Borders of <hi>Persia; Varatch,</hi> or
the Holy Cross, scituated near <hi>Van,</hi>
where they report, that <hi>Rupsameh</hi>
fixed the real Cross of Christ: <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fasasin,</hi>
or the Blessed Virgin, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Monastery near <hi>Darbiquier:
Surp Bogas,</hi> or S. <hi>Paul,</hi> at <hi>Angora.</hi>
Their Orders or Rules observed are
three, <hi>viz. Surp Savorich,</hi> or that of
S. <hi>Gregory; Surp Parsiach,</hi> or that of
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:42203:238"/>
S. <hi>Basil;</hi> and <hi>Surp Dominicos,</hi> or that
of S. <hi>Dominick.</hi> The first wear
Vests of black, with Hoods of the
same, but when they officiate in
their Mass they are cloathed in
white, with Crowns on their heads.
The second are habited like <hi>Greek
Kaloires</hi> of that Order: And the
third are cloathed in black, with no
other difference from the first than
in the cut and shape of their Hoods.
This latter of S. <hi>Dominicos</hi> they seem
to have taken from the <hi>Roman</hi>
Priests, who have gained footing and
admission amongst them, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
that <hi>Western</hi> Name, and
<hi>Modern</hi> Order, could never have
found place so far <hi>East-ward,</hi> nor so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
with those other two more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Religions, unless by imitation
or in conformity to <hi>Rome.</hi> They
observe almost the same Rules and
Orders in their manner of Worship
and Service. They eat no flesh nor
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:42203:238"/>
drink Wine; yet on <hi>Saturdays</hi> and
<hi>Sondays</hi> out of <hi>Lent</hi> they have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to eat Eggs, Milk, Butter,
and Fish. They have used them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so much to fasting from their
Infancy, that it is very curious to
observe what Custom is able to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in our Bodies, and with how small
a proportion Nature can be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in which strict manner of living
some have so far endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
that they have daily diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of their slender Diet; and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
still that Nature might be
content with a meaner proportion,
have so extenuated and macerated
their Bodies, that at length they have
miserably perished with Famine.
They arise from their Beds at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
and continue in Prayer and
Fasting until three a Clock in the
Afternoon, during which time they
are obliged to read over the whole
Psalter of <hi>David.</hi>

                        <pb n="426" facs="tcp:42203:239"/>There are Women likewise in this
Country who put themselves into
Nunneries, and live with the same
severity and strictness as do the men.
They have also some <hi>Hermites,</hi> whom
they call <hi>Gickniahore,</hi> who live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the tops of Rocks, confined
thereunto almost as severely as <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon
Stylites</hi> was to his Pillar. Nor
is this Country so remote and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
nor the Language so much
unknown, but that the <hi>Roman</hi>
Clergy hath gained a considerable
footing amongst them; whereby
they have established no less than
ten Monasteries in that Country,
all of the Order of S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> of
which I have seen and discoursed
with some of the <hi>Friers;</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
I had once opportunity to
discourse with the Arch-Bishop, who
was of the same Order, and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by the Pope over this Church,
as he was going to <hi>Rome</hi> to receive
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:42203:239"/>
his Consecration, and to obtain a
Stipend of 200 Crowns a year for
his maintenance: he told me that
he had ten Monasteries under him,
all of the Order of S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> that
his place of Residence was at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chavan,</hi>
three days journey from
<hi>Tavris,</hi> which was the place where
<hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark rested after the flood.
These of the <hi>Roman</hi> as well as of the
<hi>Armenian</hi> Church, are so wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ignorant, that they are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to render a satisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to a curious Stranger, in any
thing relating to their own Customs
and Manners; but commonly make
a reply to his Queries by begging;
for if you ask them Questions, they
will demand Alms of you.</p>
                     <p>The first time that the <hi>Roman</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
crept into this Country was
about 350 years past, by means of
one <hi>Ovan de Kurnah,</hi> who having a
wandring head, and a genius to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:42203:240"/>
Learning, somewhat more
curious than the generallity, travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into <hi>Poland,</hi> and thence into
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> where having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
something of the West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
Knowledge and Doctrine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into his own Country,
where he preached and instructed
them in the material points of their
Religion; which seemed unto them
to be all new matters, and high no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and had not entred into the
consideration and brains of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
amongst them: so that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and Tenents of <hi>Kurnah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to pass currant amongst them,
to the great admiration and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
of this travelling Doctor.
But at length touching on the Popes
Supremacy, to the prejudice of the
Patriarchal Authority and Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
the whole mass of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
became leavened, and he
forbidden farther to preach, or the
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:42203:240"/>
people to hear him: Howsoever a
considerable number adhered to his
Doctrine, and to this day rather
gain than lose ground in <hi>Armenia:</hi>
of whom there is a Church licensed
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the form of their
Mass priviledged, and squared ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that of the <hi>Latines,</hi> but
excessive long and tedious, and
much differing from that of the
<hi>Armenian,</hi> as I have seen them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
and compared together. In
the year 1678, when I was passing
through <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> in my way
from <hi>Smyrna</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> it was
confidently reported in the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of the Pope, that the Chief
Patriarch of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Church,
together with many of his Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
were on their journey towards
<hi>Rome,</hi> with intention to submit
themselves to that Church; but
having remained in those parts for
some Months after that report be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:42203:241"/>
and neither seeing nor hearing
of their nearer approach, I may
confidently conclude, that this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
is still as far off in his agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as
he is at a distance by the situation of
his Country.</p>
                     <p>As to the Service-Book which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the true and that which is
properly called the <hi>Armenian</hi> Church,
it was compiled (as they report) in
part by S. <hi>James,</hi> and the rest by
S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> and S. <hi>Basil,</hi> whose
forms of Prayer and Service are
wholly in use amongst the Eastern
Christians; for I have not heard of
any Liturgy of <hi>Surp Savorich,</hi> or
S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> in this Church, which
to me is very strange.</p>
                     <p>There not being much Literature
amongst these people, we cannot
expect to find great Libraries wrote
in their Language, or many Books
wherein the retired Monks may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:42203:241"/>
their Studies: That Book which
is of most note amongst them, and
agreeable to the design of Religious
men, is the Book of one <hi>Gregorio</hi> of
the Monastery of <hi>Stat,</hi> which treats
of the lives of holy men, and serves
in the place of Homilies read on
Festival Days, the study of which is
the chief employment of the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
Monks.</hi>

in their Church.</p>
                     <p>The Baptism of Infants they use
and esteem necessary, as being that
which washes away their Original
sin; in performance of which, the
Priest takes the Child by the Feet
and Hands, and dips it three times
under Water; which immersion of
three times, these, with the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
esteem essential unto this Sacrament;
so that where the Vessel is shallow,
and not capable to recieve the whole
Body, the Priest pours it with his
hand, that not Part or Member may
remain unbaptized.</p>
                     <p>After Baptism they apply the
Chrism, anointing the Fore-head,
Eyes, Ears, Breast, Palms of the
hands, and soals of the feet with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
Oyl in form of a Cross;
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:42203:242"/>
and then they administer unto the
Child the Holy Eucharist, which
they do only by rubbing the Lips
with it. The distribution of the
<hi>Panis Benedictus,</hi> which they call
<hi>Maz,</hi> is in use amongst them as with
the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Surp Usiun,</hi> as they call the holy
Eucharist, they celebrate only on
<hi>Sondays</hi> and Festivals, though on
other days they perform the publick
Services of the Church; whereby it
appears, that they have other Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Services besides that of the
Communion.</p>
                     <p>They put no Water into the
Wine, nor Leaven into the Bread,
as do the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They hold Transubstantiation as
do the <hi>Papists,</hi> from whom the
Priests readily accepted of such a
Doctrine as tends to their Honour
and Profit. Christ saith, <hi>This is my
Body,</hi> and <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> which
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:42203:243"/>
plain words, these good men are
willing to accept in their litteral
sense, that so they may not be put
to the subtilties of the Schools, nor
to the interpretation of Mystical
and Sacramental Terms: Let the
meaning be how it will, the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is more wise
and learned than they, hath so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
it; and if they erre, be the
fault and errour upon them.</p>
                     <p>Howsoever this Tenent of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation
is held and discussed
but of late years amongst them,
and is not altogether Universally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted;
some of them will pretend
to maintain, and others will deny it;
and declare that the Epitome of
their faith, which is mentioned only
in the 12<hi>th</hi> Chapter of this Book,
was subscribed by some few of their
Bishops, and extorted from them by
threats and rewards.</p>
                     <p>Their manner of distributing the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:42203:243"/>
Communion is done by sopping the
Bread into Wine, so that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant
receives both species toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which is different from the
Form and Custom of the <hi>Latine,
Greek</hi> and reformed Churches. They
differ from the <hi>Greeks</hi> in that they
administer Bread unleavened, made
like a Wafer; they differ from the
<hi>Romans,</hi> in that they give both Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
to the Laity, which the Priest
doth by putting his Fingers into the
Chalice, out of which he takes the
Wafer soaked in the Wine, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
that unto the Communicant.
And it is pleasant to observe, that he
hath no sooner done so, but that
some Boy or young Lad is present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at hand to lick his Fingers; which
he willingly grants him, in regard
that they esteem it a kind of initiation
or Pledge to them of receiving the
Sacrament hereafter, when they
come to years of understanding, as
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:42203:244"/>
the rubbing of the Lips of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
with the consecrated Elements,
is to Children at the time of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admittance
to Baptism.</p>
                     <p>So that when I consider, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
in what a plain manner our
Saviour instituted this Sacrament,
how easily understood, and how
clearly practised, and how facil to
be followed and brought into imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
for it is said, he took Bread
and blessed it, and brake it, and gave
it to his disciples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
he took the Cup, and gave thanks,
and gave it to them, saying, <hi>drink you
all of this.</hi> Notwithstanding which, we
may see how far the Churches have
deviated from this easie and plain
rule. The <hi>Latines</hi> administer it
with a Wafer, and deny the Cup to
the Laity; the <hi>Greeks</hi> give both
Species in a Spoon together; the
<hi>Armenians</hi> soak the Bread in the
Wine: Only God hath illuminated
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:42203:244"/>
the Reformed Churches, and taught
them how to follow the Examples
of the first Institution; and yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them likewise there is some
difference, and amongst the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
yet greater; whereby we may
judge of the malice and subtlety of
the grand Deceiver, who would
render that salutiferous food un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholesome,
and make this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Instrument of Grace and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to become the most danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
snare and ruine of Humane
Souls.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THEY use Confession in the
Ear of a Priest, who is for the
most part very rigorous in the
Penance he imposes; for if the Sin
be enormous, and very foul, he is
not contented with one bare Act
of Penitential satisfaction; but lays
a penance to continue for several
years; at the end of which it is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that the Penitent escapes, or
obtains absolution, without some
pecuniary mulct, by way of peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Offering,
or Atonement for sin, and
by which also the indignation of the
Priest himself may be satisfied and
appeased: and this penance once
imposed, no man can remit, no not
the Bishop, nor Patriarch himself.
Some I have known who have been

                     </argument>
                     <p>MArriage is not only lawful for
a Secular Priest, but is esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so necessary, that none
can be a Priest unless he enter first
into the state of Matrimony: I say
a Secular Priest, because a Bishop, or
a <hi>Monk,</hi> cannot marry, or rather
that state is not inconsistent with
the Office of a Bishop, as a Bishop,
but as the Bishops are <hi>Monks,</hi> being
always chosen out of the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Religious men. In case the
Wife of the Secular Priest dies, and
he marries again, he is, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded
and suspended from his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal
Ministry.</p>
                     <p>Lay persons are permitted to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
twice, but the third Marriage is
abominable, and esteemed as scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:42203:246"/>
and as great a Sin as Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <p>A Widow cannot marry with
other than with a Widow, as one
that hath not been married, must
take one who is reputed a Virgin,
in which they observe the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of consanguinity as are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Canons of the <hi>Western</hi>

                     <p>They usually chuse <hi>Monday</hi> Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
at or before break a-day, for the
time to be married; they begin the
Feast on <hi>Sonday</hi> Evening, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
it three or four Days with
much jollity, during which time the
Bride is kept in her Chair and State,
and almost the whole time waking,
and the Bridegroom in like manner
is obliged to keep his distance, and
not permitted to consummate the
Matrimonial Duty until <hi>Wednesday</hi>
night, or <hi>Thursday</hi> morning; when
they expose the signs of Virginity,

                     </argument>
                     <p>THEY believe that neither
the Souls nor Bodies of any
Saints or Prophets departed
this life are in Heaven; unless it be
the Blessed Virgin, and <hi>Elias</hi> the
Prophet. They believe that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
dying contrite, goes not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to Heaven, nor a Sinner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Hell, but are intercepted in the
way, and lodged together in the
same place, which they call <hi>Gayank,</hi>
which is the Eighth Heaven, where
the Stars are, and have there no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:42203:247"/>
joy or grief, but what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from a good or a bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
Those which dye with
the burden of minute sins, such as
the sins of evil thoughts or words,
go to the same place, and are freed
from Punishment by the Alms
and good works of the Faithful.</p>
                     <p>They believe, that until after
the day of resurrection, the souls of
the Righteous shall not see the face
of God, or enjoy the Beatifical Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but only be filled and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with certain beams of his
glory and Divine illumination.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding which opinion,
That the Saints shall not enter into
Heaven, until the day of judgment,
yet by a certain imitation of the
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Churches, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
them with prayers, reverence
and adore their Pictures or Images,
and burn Lamps to them, and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="444" facs="tcp:42203:248"/>The Saints which are commonly
invoked by them, are all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apostles, likewise S. <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vester,</hi>
S. <hi>Savorich,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>As to the Ceremonies used to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Dead, they observe seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
particulars. The Corps of their
Bishops and Priests they anoint with
confecrated Oyl before they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred;
but the Bodies of the Laity
are only washed after the manner
of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and fashion of the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern</hi>
parts of the World.</p>
                     <p>When any dies under the Age of
nine years, the Parents or Kindred
employ some Priest for the space of
eight days, to make Prayers for the
Soul of the deceased, who during
that time have their entertainment
of Meat and Drink defrayed at the
charge of such Parents, and on the
ninth day a solemn Office is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
for the Soul of the Deceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But those who are rich and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:42203:248"/>
do yearly at their expence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
one day for Commemoration
of their departed Relations, and for
performance of those Offices which
are instituted and appointed for the
same. <hi>Easter Monday</hi> is the day or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by Custom for visiting the
Sepulchres of their deceased Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
where, having lamented them
a while with howlings and cryes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their manner, and the Women
with most barbarous Screeches, they
presently change the Scene, and, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring
under the shadow of some
Tree, they eat, drink, and forget
their sorrow, which their Wine soon
chases away, and then they become
as dissolute in their Mirth, as they
were before undecent and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
in their Grief.</p>
                     <p>This Custom we may suppose to
have been derived from those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Solemnities which were at first
kept at the Tombs where Martyrs
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:42203:249"/>
had been buried, which usually were
in the <hi>Caemeteria,</hi> or the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,
distinct from the Church,
and in the <hi>Eastern</hi> parts are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
at some distance without the
City. To these places the people
annually resorted to celebrate the
memory of Martyrs, with Prayers,
Incense, Psalms, and Sermons, which
by the multitude of Martyrs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
afterwards so common, that
the people began to think it their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to perform this Office at the
Graves of their Relations; which
time hath now made accustomary,
and is a great part of the service and
pastime of <hi>Easter Monday.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the manner how some <hi>Friars</hi> of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church perswaded the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi>
Patriarch, and Bishops at
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> to subscribe a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
agreeable to the Tenents of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THough the great Marshal
<hi>Turenne</hi> (as is credibly report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
had alwayes inclinations
towards the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which
for many years he concealed, for
reasons best known to himself: Yet
being desirous at length to be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a Member thereof, he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
himself to be wrought upon
by such arguments as were then
suggested, amongst which none
seemed more convincing or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
to him, than that the Eastern
Churches concurred with the <hi>Roman</hi>
                        <pb n="448" facs="tcp:42203:250"/>
in all points wherein there was
any difference between the <hi>Papists</hi>
and the <hi>Protestants:</hi> to prove which,
the Ambassadour Resident for his
most Christian Majesty at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
in the year 1674, assembled
the <hi>Armenian</hi> Patriarch, and some
of his Bishops, from whom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much difficulty, he procured
a certain Confession very agreeable
to the sense of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
                     <p>A Copy of this Confession I saw,
and read, as it was delivered to me
from the <hi>Martabet,</hi> or <hi>Armenian</hi>
Bishop, wrote in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
and Character, the which
was faithfully Translated for me:
which when I well considered, it
appeared plainly to me, to be origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
the invention, form, and
contrivance of some <hi>Fryer</hi> of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, rather than the
thoughts, or Stile of an <hi>Armenian</hi>
Author.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="449" facs="tcp:42203:250"/>For first, though I understand
little of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Tongue, yet
I have some reasons to perswade
me, that there is nothing in the
<hi>Idiom</hi> of that Language, which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>responds
with the word Sacrament,
agreeable to that definition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we would understand the notion
of <hi>Sacramentum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, the professed <hi>Armenian</hi>
Doctrine holds, That there are no
other Saints in Heaven, but the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Virgin, and <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet;
and yet in this Confession, they
seem to place as many in Heaven it
self as the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in another place, one
would believe that to avoid confusion
they meant to set up the Pope for
Head of the Universal Church,
which when they come to explicate
a little farther, they only condemn
those who allow not the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church by Bishops,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:42203:251"/>
and those who believe that one
Preacher is sufficient, and that one
Priest can make another: But who
this latter sort of people is, and
where to be found, they would have
done well to have declared, before
they had taken so much pains to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
the <hi>Anathema</hi> upon them.</p>
                     <p>This Confession, which I here
mention, was in part the Occasion
and Ground of the Report, which in
the year 1676 was spread at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
of a new reconciliation, which
though it was some years after this
Confession, yet that and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of an <hi>Armenian</hi> Bishop to
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was the cause
of all the discourse; but he being a
person of no greater Revenue than
of 200 Dollars yearly Rent, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
soon appeared; it being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that the acquisition of a poor
ignorant person could have no great
influence on the Church, and might
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:42203:251"/>
have the same effect as if a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Curate in <hi>England</hi> were brought
over to the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith. This
Confession is the Cause also, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every small accident of comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
a new reconciliation is present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
divulged; and so it happened
in the year 1678. when at <hi>Rome</hi> for
six Months together it was generally
reported, That the <hi>Armenian</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch,
with six and thirty Bishops,
was on their way thither, to submit
unto and to acknowledge the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
See. Howsoever, I perswade
my self, that were the particulars,
wherein there is any Controversie
between the Church of <hi>England</hi>
and that of <hi>Rome,</hi> well stated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Capacity of the
<hi>Armenians,</hi> it would not be difficult
to procure another Confession, at
least an Explication of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
with little variety from that of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> so little Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:42203:252"/>
have these People of
Controversies; the which perhaps
would be the sense of most good
Christians in the World, who laid
aside all prepossessions to a Party or
Tenent. Howsoever, I am sure it
ought to be the Desire and Prayer
of every good Christian, that God
would be pleased to lessen and close
the Differences in the Church of
Christ, that we may have one God,
one Faith, one Baptism, and one
Head, the Lord Jesus.</p>
