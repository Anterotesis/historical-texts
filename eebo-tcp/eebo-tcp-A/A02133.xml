            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Thus Gentlemen haue you heard my verdite in this <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netto,</hi> now will I returne to <hi>Doron</hi> and <hi>Carmela,</hi> who not seeing her mother come, fell againe to a few homely kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and thus it was.</p>
            <p>After they had thus amorously ended their Eclogues, they plighted faith and troth; and <hi>Carmela</hi> verie brisklye wiping her mouth with a white apron sealed it with a kisse, which <hi>Doron</hi> taking merueilous kindly, after a little play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loath to depart, they both went about their businesse. Leauing them therefore to their businesse, again to <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;</hi> who seeing no intreaties would serue to perswade <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mela</hi> to loue, neither the hope of the <hi>Arcadian</hi> Crowne, nor the title of a Queene, lastly assayed with frownes and threates, but all in vaine: for <hi>Samela</hi> first restrained by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in that he was her Father, and secondly by loue in that <hi>Melicertus</hi> lay imprisoned onely for her sake, stoode still so
<pb facs="tcp:6123:48"/>
stiffe to her tackling, that <hi>Democles</hi> chaunging loue into hate, resolued to reuenge that with death, which no meanes els might satisfie: so that to colour his frauds withall, he gaue <hi>Samela</hi> free license to visite <hi>Melicertus:</hi> which she had not long done, but that by the instigation of the old King, the gailor confederate to his treacherie, accuseth her of adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: whervpon without further witnesse they both were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned to dye. These two louers knowing themselues guiltlesse in this surmised faction, were ioyfull to ende their loues with their liues, and so to conclude all in a fatall and finall content of mindes and passions. But <hi>Democles</hi> set free <hi>Pleusidippus,</hi> as afraide the King of <hi>Thessaly</hi> would reuenge the wrong of his Knight, intertaining him with sumptuous banquets, as befitted so braue and worthie a Gentleman. The day came prefixed wherein these parties should die; <hi>Samela</hi> was so desirous to end her life with her friend, that she would not reueale either vnto <hi>Democles</hi> or <hi>Melicertus</hi> what she was; and <hi>Melicertus</hi> rather chose to die with his <hi>Samela,</hi> than once to name himself <hi>Maximius.</hi> Both thus resolued, were brought to the place of execution; and<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

At this answere <hi>Pleusidip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> wrapt his face in his cloake and wept, and all the assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants grieued to see so faire a creature subiect to the violent rage of fortune. Well <hi>Democles</hi> commaunded the deaths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to doo his deuoyre; who knéeling downe and crauing pardon, readie to giue <hi>Melicertus</hi> the fatall stroake, there slept out an olde woman attired like a Prophetesse, who cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out; Uillaine hold thy hand, thou wrongest the daughter of a King. <hi>Democles</hi> hearing the outcrie, and seeing that at
