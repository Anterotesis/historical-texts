            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>YOU being at this time called upon by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to joyn in Communion with the Church, and the Laws ordered to be put in Execution against such as refuse it; its both your Duty and Interest to enquire into the grounds upon which you deny Obedience to the Laws, Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a Church of God, and thereby expose our Religion to danger, and your selves to suffering.

               </note> (as you are told by some in the same condition with your selves.)</p>
            <p>To assist persons in this enquiry, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that of late several of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have undertaken the most material points that you do question, and have handled them with that Candor and Calmness which becomes their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and the gravity of the Arguments, and which may the better invite those that are willing to be satisfied, to peruse and consider them. But because Truth and Reason do too often suffer by the prejudices we have against particular persons; to remove, as much as may be, that obstruction, I have in this Treatise shewed that these Authors are not alone, but have the concurrent Testimony of the most eminent Non-Conformists for them, who do generally grant that there is nothing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Parochial Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that can be a sufficient reason for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from it. The sence of many of these I
<pb facs="tcp:62546:3"/>
have here collected, and for one hundred I could easily have produced two, if the Cause were to go by the Pole; so that if Reason or Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will prevail, I hope that yet your satisfaction and recovery to the Communion of the Church is not to be despaired of: Which God of his infinite mercy grant for your own and the Churches sake. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>THE NON-CONFORMISTS PLEA FOR Lay-Communion With the CHURCH of <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Christian World is divided into two Ranks, Ecclesiastical and Civil, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually known by the names of <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity,</hi> Ministers and People. The Clergy, besides the things essentially belonging to their Office, are by the Laws of all well-ordered Churches in the World, strictly obliged by Declarations or Subscriptions, or both, to owne and maintain the Doctrine, Discipline and Constitution of the Church into which they are admitted. Thus in the Church of <hi>England</hi> They do subscribe to the truth of the Doctrine more especially contained in the Thirty Nine Articles, and declare that they will use the Forms and Rites contained in the Liturgy, and promise to submit to the Government in its Orders.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62546:6"/>
The design of all which is to preserve the Peace of the Church, and the Unity of Christians, which doth much depend upon that of its Officers and Teachers.</p>
            <p>But the Laity are under no such Obligations, there being no Declarations or Subscriptions required of them, nor any thing more than to attend upon, and joyn with the Worship practised and allowed in the Church. Thus it is in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is acknowledged by a worthy Person,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> Defence of the Cure, part 2. p. 29.</note> to whom when it was objected that many Errours in Doctrine and Life were imposed as Conditions of Communion, he replies, <hi>What is imposed on you as a Condition to your Communion in the Doctrine and Prayers of the Parish-Churches, but your actual Communion it self?</hi> In dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing therefore about the lawfulness of Communion with a Church, the difference betwixt these two must be carefully observed, lest the things required only of one Order of Men should be thought to belong to all.<note place="margin">A Book licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d.</hi>
               </note> It's observed by one, <hi>That the original of all our mischiefs sprung from mens confounding the terms of Ministerial Conformity with those of Lay-Communion with the Parochial Assemblies; there being much more required of Ministers than of the People: private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons having much less to say for themselves in absenting from the Publick Worship of God, though performed by the Liturgy, than the Pastor hath for not taking Oaths, &amp;c.</hi> Certainly, if this difference was but observed, and the Case of Lay-Communion truly stated and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Cure, p. 311.</note> 
               <hi>the people would not be far more averse to Communion with the Parish-Churches than the Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Ministers are,</hi> as one complains; and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they might think of the Conformity of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,<note place="margin">Continuat. Morning Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, Serm 4. p. 89.</note> 
               <hi>because of the previous terms required of them, they would judge what is required of the people to be lawful,</hi> as some of them do. And as the Ministers by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62546:6"/>
bringing their Case to the Peoples may see Communion then to be lawful, and find themselves obliged to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it in a private capacity; so the People by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their Case not to be that of the Ministers, but widely different from it, would be induced to hold Communion with the Church, and to joyn with those of their Ministers that think it their Duty so to do; and are therein of the opinion of the old Non-Conformists that did not act <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rathband</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the Reader, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to the grave and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>, <hi>as if there was no mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle between separation from the Church and true Worship thereof, and subscription unto, or practice or approbation of all the corruptions of the same.</hi> For <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Nichol</hi>'s Plea for the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</note> 
               <hi>though they would not subscribe to the Ceremonies, yet they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst separation from Gods Publick Worship,</hi> as one of them in the name of the rest doth declare. So that as great a difference as there is betwixt presence and Consent, betwixt bare Communion and approbation, betwixt the Office of the Minister and the attendance of a private person, so much is there betwixt the Case of Ministerial and Lay-Communion: And therefore when we consider the Case of Lay-Communion, we are only to respect what is required of the people, what part they are to have and exercise in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Church. Now what they are concerned in, are either, The Forms that are imposed, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures they are to use, and the Times they are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, for the Celebration of Divine Worship; or, The Ministration, which they may be remotely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd also to be concerned in.</p>
            <p>The lawfulness of all which, and of all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in Lay-Communion amongst us, I shall not undertake to prove and maintain by Arguments taken from those that already are in full Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and so are obliged to justifie it; but from those that in some things do dissent from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62546:7"/>
it, who may therefore be supposed to be impartial and whose Reasons may be the more heeded as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from themselves, and from such that are as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in other respects to owne the miscarriages of the Church; as those that wholly separate from it.</p>
            <p>For the better understanding of the Case, and of their Judgment in it, I shall consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What opinion the most eminent and sober Non-Conformists have had of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

certainly the number of such is much advanced since his time.

            <p>Before I proceed, I shall only make this inference from what hath been said, that if the Church of <hi>England</hi> be a true Church, the Churches true Churches, the Ministry a true Ministry, the Doctrine found and Orthodox, the worship in the main good and allowable, and the defects such as render not the Ordinances unacceptable to God, and ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to us; I think there is much said toward the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Communion with that Church lawful, and to justifie those that do join in it? which brings to the second general, which is to consider,</p>
            <p n="2">2. What opinion the sober and eminent Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists have of Communion with the Church of <hi>England</hi>? And they generally hold,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they are not totally to separate from it; this follows from the former, and must be own'd by all them that hold she is a true Church; for to own it to be such, and yet to separate totally from it would be to own and disown it at the same time: So say the members of the Assembly of Divines,<note place="margin">Papers for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodation, p. 47.</note> 
               <hi>Thus to depart from true Churches, is not to hold Communion with them as such, but rather by departing to declare them not to be such.</hi>

               </note> I shall conclude this with what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Robinson</hi> saith in this Case; <hi>viz. For my self thus I believe with my heart before God, and profess with my tongue, and have before the World, that I have one and the same Faith, Spirit, Baptism and Lord, which I had in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that I esteem so many in that Church, of what state or Order soever, as are truly Partakers of that Faith (as I account thousands to be) for my Christian Brethren, and my self a Fellow-member with them, of that one Mystical Body of Christ, scattered far and wide throughout the World: that I have always in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62546:14"/>
and affection, all Christian Fellowship and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, and am most ready in all outward Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Exercises of Religion, lawful and lawfully done, to express the same: And withal, that I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the hearing of the Word of God there preached in the manner and upon the grounds formerly mentioned, both lawful, and upon occasion necessary for me and all true Christians, withdrawing from that Hierarchical Order of Church-Government and Ministry, and the uniting in the Order and Ordinances instituted by Christ.</hi> Thus far He.</p>
            <p>From what hath been said upon this Head we may observe, that though these Reverend Persons do go upon different Reasons, according to the Principles they espouse, though they agree not in the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they all agree that the Parochial Churches are or may be (as I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before) true Churches of Christ, that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with such Churches is lawful, and that we are to go as far as we can toward Communion with them. Though they differ about the Notion of Hearing, as whether it be an Act of Communion, and about the Call of those they hear, yet they all agree in the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of it. And therefore to separate wholly in this Ordinance, and from the Parochial Churches as no Churches, are equally condemned by all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They hold, that they are not to separate from a Church for unlawful things, if the things accounted unlawful are not of so heinous a nature as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church a Church, and affect the Vitals of Religion; or are not imposed as necessary terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>

<q>The Church may be corrupted many ways, in Doctrine, Ordinances, Worship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there are degrees of this Corruption, the Doctrine in some remote Points, the Worship in some Rituals of mans invention or custom.

<q>There were many great corruptions in the Church of the Jews in Christ's time, the Priests and Teachers were ignorant and wicked, and had a corrupt and unlawful entrance into their calling; and the People were like to the Priest, generally notoriously and obstinately ungodly; and the Worship used in that Church was wofully corrupt, many superstitious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the observation whereof were more strictly

<q>To separate from a Church for some evil only conceived, or indeed in the Church, which might and should be tolerated and healed with a spirit of meekness, and of which the Church is not yet convinced, though perhaps himself be, for this or the like reasons to withdraw from publick Communion in word, seals, or censures, is unlawful and sinful.</q>

of which case I shall shew from them,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That as defects and faults in worship, so neither is the pretence of better edification a sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against Communion with a Church.

Therefore its fit to have a right notion of edification, which, saith a Reverend Person,<note place="margin">Continuat. of Morn. Exer. Serm. 4. p. 95.</note> 
               <hi>lies more in the informing of our judgments, and confirming our resolutions, than in the gusts and relishes of affection.</hi> These, as he saith, <hi>are indeed of great use to the other,</hi> but without them are far from making a Person better, and leaving him truly edifyed.

               <hi>Hildersham</hi> charges it upon such; <hi>Thou mightest receive profit (if the fault be not in thy self) by the meanest of us that preach.</hi> And he thus freely again declares himself; <hi>I am perswaded, there is never a Minister that is of the most excellent gifts (if he have a Godly heart) but he can truly say, he never heard any faithful Minister in his life that was so mean, but he could discern some gift in him that was wanting in himself, and could receive

               <q>Do not think to prosper by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the hedge, under pretence of any right of Holiness [so of edification] whatsoever, following any party that would draw you to Separation.</q>
The mischief of which is represented by Dr. <hi>Tuckney; Experience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Serm. at <hi>Pauls</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> 9.31.</note> saith he, <hi>hath taught us that the Church of God hath been poorly edifyed by those who have daubed up their</hi> Babel <hi>with untempered mortar,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>when the Church is rent by Schisms and Factions, and one Congregation is turned into many Conventicles, falsely now called Churches, this doth diminish, weaken, and ruine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, When they do grant that edification may serve to guide us, and that we may hear where we can most profit, its with such limitations and cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as these; it must be <hi>seldom, in a great case,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>offence</hi> and <hi>contempt.</hi>

<q>God will have mercy and not sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as distance of habitation, handling such a point. But most certainly members of Churches ought mostly to be with their own Churches— The ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined content in hearing others, is rather a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation than motion of the Spirit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From all which we may conclude, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of better edification is no sufficient reason for Separation from a Church, Worship, or Ministry, without there be other reasons that do accompany it; and then it is not for this reason so much as those it is in conjunction with.</p>
            <p>But admitting this, yet it will hardly be granted to be a reason for Separation from the Church of

<q>Because I see many of them that have most knowledge, and are forwardest professors offend in this way, I will manifest the sin of these men. 1.

               <hi>Tombs</hi> declares himself freely in;
<q>If we look to experience of former times, there is now ground to expect a blessing from conforming Preachers, as well, or rather more, than from Preachers of the separated Churches. Sure the conversion, consolation, strengthening, establishing of Souls in the truth, has been more in <hi>England</hi> from Preachers, who were Enemies to Separation, whether Non-Conformist to Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or Conformists, Presbyterial or Episcopal, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from Bishops themselves, than from the best of the Separatists. I think all that are acquainted with the History of things in the last age, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that more good hath been to the Souls of men, by the Preaching of <hi>Vsher, Potter, Abbot, Jewel,</hi> and some other Bishops; by <hi>Preston, Sibbs, Taylor, Whately, Hildersham, Ball, Perkins, Dod, Stock,</hi> and many thousands, Adversaries to the separated Churches, than ever was done by <hi>Ainsworth, John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Robinson,</hi> rigid Separatists, or <hi>Cotton, Tho. Hooker,</hi> and others (though men of precious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory) promoters of the way of the Churches Congregational. And therefore if the Bishops and conforming Preachers now apply themselves (as we hope when the heat of contention is more allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they will) to the profitable way of preaching against Popery and Prophaneness, exciting Auditors to the life of faith in Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there may be as good ground, if not better (considering how much the Spirits of Separatists are for their party, and <hi>the speaking of the truth in love, and edifying in love,</hi> is necessary to <hi>the growth of the Body,</hi> Eph. 4.15.) to expect by them a blessing in promoting
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62546:29"/>
the power of Godliness, than from the Separatists.</q>
So that whether we consider the Worship or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or the preaching of it, the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in their apprehension doth not want a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of means for the conversion and edification of Souls: And consequently the argument taken from edification, in justification of forsaking the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of it, is inconclusive and of no force. But this branch of it will be further confirm'd under the third general.</p>
            <p>But however, this will not be so easily quitted, for supposing the Doctrine good, and those that teach it capable (as far as learning and parts are requisite) to improve it to the conversion and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of others; yet if they themselves are loose and scandalous, it may give just offence, and be thought a sufficient cause to separate from the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in which such do officiate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Therefore I shall shew, that the badness of the Ministers is of it self no sufficient reason to forsake the Communion of a Church, or to separate from the Worship administred in it.<note place="margin">Seven Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Tract 3. c. 4. p. 223.</note> What holy M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> saith is a great truth;
<q>It is not to be denied, but that the example of ignorant and unreformed, especially notorious Persons in the Ministry, hath done and doth much harm; and if either they cannot be convicted, or if their crimes be such as cannot remove them out of their places, there is just cause of grief that such should have any thing to do in Gods matters, which are so weighty and to be dealt withal in high reverence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But yet before the objection is admitted, it is to be premised, 1. That if there be such in the Church, it doth not proceed from their Conformity to it. For good and pious men of this sort always were and

            </p>
            <p>But supposing it be allowed that we ought not to separate from a Church, where corrupt Members are tolerated or connived at under some present cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances (as for want of due proof, or through particular favour) yet it seems to be allowable where there is no Discipline exercised, or taken care of.

            <p>The former of these they do own and prove.</p>

               <note place="margin">

               <hi>Cartwright,</hi> who thus argues;
<q>That Church Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies are builded by Faith only on Christ the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, the which Faith so being, whatsoever is wanting of that which is commanded, or remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62546:35"/>
of that which is forbidden, is not able to put that Assembly from the right and title of so being the Church of Christ— For though there be many things necessary for every Assembly, yet they be necessary to the comely and stable being, and not simply to the being of the Church.</q>
And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he gives an instance in the Dutch Assemblies (or Lutheran Churches) which,<note place="margin">P. 106.</note> he saith, <hi>are maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Discipline.</hi>

<q>Whereas now in some of the Parishes of this Kingdom, there are many Godly Men that do constantly give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to the Worship of God in publick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These notwithstanding their mixture and want of Discipline, I never thought for my part, but that they were true Churches of Christ, and Sister Churches, and so ought to be acknowledged.</q>
So that if Discipline be not essential to a true Church, and a true Church is not to be separated from (as has been proved above) then the want of Discipline is no sufficient reason for Separation.</p>

               <note place="margin">Cure Dir. 47. p. 231.</note> 
               <hi>Many that observe the pollution of the Church by the great neglect of holy Discipline, avoid this error by turning to a sinful Separation.</hi> I shall conclude this with that grave advice of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>;<note place="margin">Evangel. Love, c. 3. p. 77.</note>
               <q>When any Church, whereof a man is by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent antecedently a Member, doth fall in part or in whole from any of those Truths which it hath professed, or when it is overtaken with a neglect of Discipline or Irregularities in its Administration; such a one is to consider, that he is placed in his present state by Divine Providence, that he may orderly therein endeavour to put a stop unto such defections, and to exercise his Charity, Love, and Forbearance towards the persons of them whose miscarriages at present he cannot remedy. In such cases there is a large and spatious Field for Wisdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Patience, Love and prudent Zeal to exercise themselves. And <hi>it is a most erverse imagination, that Separation is the only cure for Church disorders.</hi>
               </q>
If this advice be good in one

            <p n="2">2. I shall shew how little this plea of the Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Discipline reaches the case.

               <q>Take heed of extreams. It is the ordinary Temptation in a time of differences, to think we cannot run too far from them we differ from, and so whilst we decline one Rock we split upon another. Remember the old Non-Conformists were equal Enemies to Superstition and Separation. Maintain (I beseech you) sober Principles, such as these are, that every defective Ministry is not a false Ministry; that sinful super-additions do not nullifie Divine institutions; that sinful defects in Ordinances do not hinder the saving effects of them. That there is a difference betwixt directing a Worship, prescribing things simply evil and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly idolatrous, and directing about Worship, things doubtfully good being injoyned, but the unquestionable substance of Worship being main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</q>
This latter doth not justifie Separation.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The use of Forms is declared by them to be a thing lawful in it self, and what God hath left us at liberty to use or not to use as we see occasion. So Mr. <hi>Ball</hi>;<note place="margin">Tryal, c. 2. p. 36. &amp;c. 8. p. 131.</note>

               <q>As for the publick Congregation, special care must be had that nothing be done in Praying, Preaching or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring the Sacraments, but what is decent and orderly, because there many Eyes do see us, and many Ears hear us; and upon this account, it is expedient for the most part to keep a constant Form both of matter and words.<note place="margin">Life of Mr. <hi>W.

Prayer are according to the practice of all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, even the best Reformed; yea, and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> himself saith, upon the Lords Prayer (though as then he was warping, and afterwards wandred far in the ways of Separation) that it was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the ancient Church, and of all the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches in Christendom, of the Churches immediately after the Apostles; nay (saith he) of the Church in the time of the Apostles, as may be probably gathered out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26.

               <hi>It is very well known that the flower of our own Divines went on in this way, when they might have done otherwise, if they had pleased, in their Prayers before Sermons.</hi> This we are told of Mr. <hi>Bradshaw</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi>

I know there are several Objections against Forms of Prayer, but I know also that these are answered by them. But since the most common is, that of quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and stinting the Spirit; I shall briefly give their sence of it. They say,</p>

                  <hi>Ball</hi>'s Tryal, c. 5. p. 83.</note>2. They say, that <hi>the Spirit instructeth us what to ask, not in what phrase of speech. It stirreth up in us holy desires, but giveth not ability suddenly and without help to express and lay open our hearts in fit method and significant Words— Ability of speech is a common gift of the Spirit, which the Lord bestoweth upon good and bad,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>As to Kneeling,</p>

               <hi>Kneeling at the Sacrament was disliked by all, but yet thought tolerable, and that it might be submitted to by some of the most learned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all which we may conclude with Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">On the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, p. 102.</note> that the posture being a circumstance of action, as well as the time and place, <hi>is not of the Free-hold of the ordinance</hi>; and with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sacril. desert. p. 19.</note> that those that think they must not receive, kneeling, <hi>think errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</hi> As for standing up at the Creed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Christ.

            <p>Thus I have considered the most material points, in which the Lay-members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are concern'd, and shew'd that the lawfulness of the things injoyned upon such, is declared and justified by the suffrage and judgement of as eminent Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists as have lived in the several ages since that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy controversie was first set on foot amongst us. And now what remains, but that every one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned set himself seriously and impartially to consider it; and it becomes such so to do when they go against the stream of the most experienced writers of their own party, who might pretend to understand the case as well, if not better than any that were conversant in it. It becomes such,
<q>when they bury that under
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62546:42"/>
the condemnation of false worship, which the Lord, the author of all truth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ball</hi>'s Tryal, Epist. to Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> doth allow in his service. When they forsake the prayers of the Congregation, and depart from the Table of the Lord, and break off society and communion with the Churches of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when they expose Religion to contempt, and the truth of God to reproach, by the rents and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions in the Church, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Ball</hi> doth represent it.</q>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Defence. p. 17, 52.</note>It becomes them, <hi>when our division gratifieth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, and greatly hazardeth the Protestant Religion, and by it we may lose all which the several parties contend about,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath proved.</p>
            <p>It becomes them when the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the bulwark of the Protestant Religion amongst us at home, and that according to the noted saying of Mr. <hi>Eger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, The withdrawing totally from it, would more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally introduce Popery, than all the works of</hi> Bellarmine.</p>
            <p>It becomes them when this is the Bulwark of it abroad, and
<q>all the reformed Churches in the world have a venture in this Bottom,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Brinsley</hi> discourses.</p>
            <p>Lastly, It becomes them when divisions and separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions draw down the displeasure of God and lay us o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to his Judgements.<note place="margin">Dwelling with God, Serm. 6. p. 313, 314.</note> Therefore Dr. <hi>Bryan</hi> after he hath largely insisted upon the Argument and the present case amongst us doth thus apply himself,
<q>O that I could prevail with you, to lay sadly to heart the greatness of the sin of divisions, and the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vousness of the punishment threatned against it, and hath been executed for it; and that the Leaders and encouragers of private Christians to make this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62546:42"/>
sinful separation, would read oft, and me ditate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Jude</hi>'s Epistle to <hi>v.</hi> 20. and that the multitudes that are willing to be led by them would follow the prescription of the means here to preserve or recover themselves from this seduction, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21. And that both would leave off their reviling the Government Ecclesiastical, and the Ministers that conform, and submissively behave themselves by the example of <hi>Michael,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
