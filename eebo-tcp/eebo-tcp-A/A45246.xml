            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have thrice beene tempted upon the offers of great rewards and honours, to betray this Castle. The first was by Sir <hi>Richard Biron,</hi> another by M. <hi>Sutton,</hi> both which I acquainted the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee withall, and returned scornfull refusals unto: but now being this third time sollicited unto it, I thought it my duty to acquaint those that have here entrusted me, both for their satisfaction and my own discharge, if any thing should happen to my prejudice hereafter; for I expect that now they see their attempts in this kind fruitlesse, they will as basely endeavour to blemish with false aspersions that honesty which with bribes they cannot corrupt; be pleased therefore to understand the whole proceeding of this last of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and the occasion of it, which was this.</p>
                  <p>Colonell <hi>Dacre,</hi> one that was formerly in the North, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friend and acquaintance of my brothers, sent to me to desire that he might have the liberty to see him, to which, with the knowledge of the Committee, I gave consent; and then being in his company, desired some words in private with my brother, pretending a desire to be satisfied in some doubts of his concerning this warre; but some accidents then falling out, he was prevented of that private conference, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desired that my brother some two dayes after would come to his quarters; but he, to prevent all suspitions, would not goe but writ him a deniall: after which Colonell <hi>Dacre</hi> writ very earnestly to him to come againe, and invited Captaine <hi>Poulton</hi> to come with him; but my brother would not, only with the leave of the Committee sent Captain <hi>Poulton</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
<pb facs="tcp:54047:2"/>
it, of whose going we intended to make such use, as if we could, to discover how the enemy lay, and what their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions were: so soon as he came thither, he was most kindly entertained, and Colonell <hi>Dacre</hi> taking him aside, told him, that now the Governour of <hi>Nottingham</hi> and his brother had an occasion offerd to gain themselves great honour, to do the King very good service, and to receive a great recompence for so doing; which he demanding how that was, the Colonell told him, that if I would deliver up the Castle, the command of it should be confirmed to me and my heires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ten thousand pound and be well assured of it before ever I delivered the Castle, and that I should bee made the best Lord in <hi>Nottingham</hi> shire, that my brother should have three thousand pound to deliver the Bridges, and that Cap. <hi>Poulton</hi> should have two thousand pound to get this effected; to which Capt. <hi>Poulton</hi> answered, that he thought it was an impossible thing, for the Governour had formerly been tempted with such like offers, and had refused them, that we all scorned so base an act, and that for his own part he would starve and rot before he would betray his trust: the Colonell was further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate with him, to move it to me, and that you may, saith he, be better assured I do not this without Commission, and then pul'd out of his pocket a paper written with these words, or to this effect; <hi>These are to authorize Colonell</hi> Dacre <hi>to treat with Colonell</hi> Hutchinson <hi>and Lievtenant Colonell</hi> Hutchinson <hi>for the surrendring up of the Castle and Bridges of Nottingham for the service of his Maiesty, and to make them large promises which shall be performed:</hi> and this paper signed with <hi>W. Newcastle</hi> at the bottome: and he further desired, that he might but come to the Castle to speak with me, when Captaine <hi>Poulton</hi> told him there was no hope of obtaining that, he entreated him that he would but deliver the message to me, which he told him he would doe; and the Colonell told him, that if I would not deliver the Castle, yet if he himselfe would but leave us, and come away, he should immediately have a Regiment of

I confesse, had it not been for drawing a scandall or jealousie on my self, I would have gone so farre as to have gotten the Propositions under Coll. <hi>Dacre</hi> his hand, if not under the Marquesse his hand; but this I durst not doe, lest my own honest intentions should in the mean time have been mistaken: I therefore thought it sufficient to make it present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne to the Committee, and so to acquaint you with it, and withall to assure you, that were I certaine we should utter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>YOu have now convinced me of an errour, I once thought it possible that some rash mis-led young men might still among the Cavaliers have retained a sence of Gallantry and Honour, though no Religion; and have been enriched with those morall vertues which made the Heathen famous; such a one I beleeved you to be; but since you can attempt to buy me to so great a villany, as you did in your late propositions by Captain <hi>Poulton,</hi> I must needs be perswaded, you would never offer me what you your self would not have done: 'Tis I confesse strange to me you could imagine, that a Christian, a Gentleman, or a Commonwealths-man would ever prove such a Villain, as for a little gaudie di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Brother, you would have thought it easier for you your selfe alone to have conquered all the men now fighting in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, than to corrupt that guard of vertues which protect his constant soule from treacherous thoughts. Did you think men of sence will part with reall Honour for a Title? you are not capable of a religious consideration; or I could tell you, That our souls (redeemed with an unvaluable price) are by you most unequally valued at a poore inconsiderable summe of money; but your thoughts cannot reach heaven: look upon earth, and give me an example where ever any Traitor preserved his foul name from an horrid blot of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my on him and on his house for ever? How can you think, He that by you will be corrupted to betray anothers trust, will not by another be again corrupted to betray yours? Keep your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised Coyne to tempt some fraile waiting-woman, it may work with her to procure such honest things as you affect; but desist these base attempts on men of nobler spirits, with whom they will but render you as contemptible as your offers. Consider the unworthy message you sent, and blush at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of your guilt in it, and if yet you have so much worth left in you, repent the injury you did to him that was your Friend. Farewell that name for evermore between us.</p>

               <p>I Was in hopes to have waited on you this day, but indeed I received an Expresse last night from my Lord Generall, wherein I am commanded to wait on his Excellencie neere <hi>Chesterfield</hi> this day. Sir, I hope you remember the businesse I spoke to you of when you were at my quarter; I will engage my selfe upon my life, that what I promised shall bee really performed; if you please but to consider and truly value the businesse, I make no question but I may obtain my desires:

               <p>SIr, had the Cavalliers since found out a way to performe their promises better then they did at <hi>Bristow, Gainsborough,</hi> &amp;c. you might have had some hopes of a young man whose best fortune is his sword: but so unworthie have their dealings ever beene, so little faith and honour doe you give testimonie of, in tempting me to act such things as gallant men would not accept, if offered; that I must tell you these unworthy wayes you take to advance your cause, are but so many confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to me in this I doe maintaine against you. He that fights for honour, not for plunder, to which the Dutch Prince hath well trained all your armies, would scorne to receive his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Fort on any conditions, but such as were purchased by his prevailing valour, not undermining treachery: to which, Sir, I am as unflexible, as you to worth and goodnesse. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour I beleeve and his brother have returned you their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers; and you may in this receive the negative resolution of</p>
