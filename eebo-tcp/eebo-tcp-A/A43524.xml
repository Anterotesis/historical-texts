            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

These Considerations towards a Gentleman of your worth, Curiosity, and loyalty, are warrant enough to justifie me in this Dedication.

The succession of Bishops continued as it did before, but fitted in the form and manner of their Consecrations,<note place="margin">Bishops a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Order from that of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</note> according to the Rules laid down with the fourth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> celebrated <hi>Anno</hi> 407. or thereabouts, and generally received in all the Provinces of the Western Church, as appears by the Book of <hi>Consecrating Arch-Bishops and Bishops,</hi> &amp;c.

let us next look into the Body of the Book it self, where, in the Form of <hi>Consecrating</hi> of <hi>Arch-Bishops,</hi> or <hi>Bishops,</hi> we finde a Prayer in these words, <hi>viz. Almighty God, giver of all good things, who hast appointed divers</hi> Orders <hi>of</hi> Ministers <hi>in thy Church, Mercifully behold this thy Servant, now called to the Work and Ministry of a</hi> Bishop, <hi>and replenish him so with the truth of Doctrine, and Innocency of Life, that both by word and deed he may faithfully serve thee in this Office,</hi> &amp;c. Here we have three <hi>Orders</hi> of Ministers, <hi>Bishops, Priests,</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi>; the <hi>Bishop</hi> differing as much in <hi>Order</hi> from the <hi>Priest,</hi> as the <hi>Priest</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in Order from the <hi>Deacon</hi>; which might be further made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the different <hi>Forms</hi> used in <hi>Ordering</hi> of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> and the form prescribed for the <hi>Consecration</hi> of an Arch-Bishop, or Bishop, were not this sufficient.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But though the <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Priests,</hi> were both in <hi>Order</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/>

               <note place="margin">The Power ascribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Priest or Presbyter,</note> and consequently not enabled to exercise any publick Jurisdiction in <hi>Foro judicii,</hi> in the Courts of Judicature: yet they retained their native and original power in <hi>Foro Conscientiae,</hi> in the Court of Conscience, by hearing the confession of a sorrowful and afflicted <hi>Penitent,</hi> and giving him the comfort of <hi>Absolution,</hi> a power conferred upon them in their <hi>Ordination</hi>; in the Form where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is prescribed that the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and the assisting <hi>Presbyters,</hi> shall lay their Hands upon the Head of the Party who is to be <hi>Ordained Priest,</hi> the Bishop only saying these words, <hi>viz. Receive the Holy Ghost, whose sins thou doest forgive they are forgiven, and whose sins thou doest retain, they are retained; In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.</hi> Which words had been impertinently, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significantly used, if the <hi>Priest</hi> received nor thereby power to <hi>absolve</hi> a sinner, upon the sense of his sincere and true repentance, manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Confession, or in any other way whatsoever.

               <hi>and the benefit of Absolution, to the quieting of his Conscience, and avoiding all scruple and doubtfulness.</hi> Agreeable whereunto is that memorable saying of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> viz. <hi>Qui confiteri vult ut inveniat gratiam, qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which form of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,</hi> is plainly <hi>Authoritative,</hi> and not <hi>Declarative</hi> only, (such as that is which follows the <hi>General Confession,</hi> in the beginning of the Morning and Evening Prayer) as some men would have it.</p>

<q>That if any man Confess his secret and hidden sins to the Minister, for the unburthening of his Conscience, and to receive spiritual Consolation and ease of Minde from him, we do not any way binde the said Minister by this our <hi>Constitution</hi>: but do streightly charge and admonish him that he do not at any time reveal and make known to any person whatsoever any Crime or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence so committed to his secresie, (except they be such Crimes as by the Laws of this Realm his own Life may be called in question for concealing the same) under the pain of <hi>Irregularity.</hi>

And by incurring the condition of <hi>Irregularity,</hi> the party offending doth not only forfeit all the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Preferments which he hath at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but renders himself uncapable of receiving any other for the time to come. <hi>Confession</hi> made upon such security will be as saving to the <hi>Fame</hi> of the Penitent, as the <hi>Absolution</hi> to his Soul.

               <note place="margin">the Authority of Absolution more fully justified.</note> &amp;c.

The question is, whether the use of pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Images on the Walls or Windows were tolerated or forbidden by the Rule of the Reformation; They which conceive them to have been forbidden by the Rules of the Church, alledge for defence of their opinion, the Queens injunction, published in the first year of her Reign, <hi>Anno</hi> 1559. the Articles of the Regal Visitation following thereupon, and the main scope of the three Homilies against the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of Idolatry. In the first of which it was ordered, first,
<q>That to the intent that all Superstition, and Hypocrisie crept into divers mens hearts might vanish away, no Ecclesiastical persons should set forth or extol the Dignity of any Images, Reliques, or Miracles; but declaring the abuse of the same, they shall teach that all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, health, and grace ought to be both asked and looked for only of God as the very author and giver of the same, and of none other. <hi>Num.</hi> 2. And secondly, That they shall take away, utterly extinct, and destroy all <hi>Shrines,</hi> coverings of <hi>Shrines,</hi> all Tables, Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks, <hi>Trindals,</hi> and Rolls of Wax, Pictures, Paintings, and all other Monuments of fained Miracles, Pilgrimages, Idolatry, and Superstition; so that there remain no memory of the same, in Walls, Glass-Windows, or elsewhere, within their Churches and Houses; preserving and repairing nevertheless both the Walls and Glass-Windows: and that they should exhort all their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishioners to do the like, within their several Houses, <hi>Num.</hi> 23. For which last, there follows afterwards a more special <hi>Injunction, Numb.</hi> 35.<note place="margin">The Articles of the Regal Visitation,</note>
               </q>
According whereunto this <hi>Article</hi> was framed to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation. <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>Whither in all Churches, and Chappels, all Images, Shrines, Tables, Candlesticks, Trindals, and Rolls of Wax, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, Paintings, and other Monuments of feigned and false Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, Pilgrimages, Idolatry, and Superstition, were removed, abolished, and destroyed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 2.</q>
But these objections carried their own answers in them, it being manifest by the words both of the Articles and Injunctions, that it never was the meaning of the Queen, her Councel, or Commissioners, to condemn, abolish, or deface all Images, either of Christ himself, or of any of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, and other godly Fathers in the Church of Christ; the abuse whereof is ordered to be reformed by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54785:10"/>
the first Injunction,<note place="margin">and</note> but only to remove such Pictures of false and feigned Miracles, as had no truth of being, or existence in Nature; and therefore were the more abused to Superstition, and Idolatry in the times of <hi>Popery.</hi> In answer to such passages as are alledged out the said Homilies, it is replyed; first, that is confessed in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the last of the said three <hi>Homilies,</hi> that Images in Churches <hi>are not simply forbidden by the New Testament, Hom.</hi> Fol. 39. And therefore no offence committed against the Gospel, if they be used only for History, Example, and stirring up of pure Devotion in the souls of men; in which respect called not unfitly by Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, The Lay-mans Books.</hi> Secondly, The Compilers of those Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies were the more earnest in point of removing or excluding Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the better to wean the People from the sin of Idolatry, in which they had been trained up from their very infancy,<note place="margin">What is to be said in answer to such passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as are found against them in the Book of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</note> and were not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be weaned from it, then by taking away the occasions of it. And thirdly, All that vehemence is used against them; not as intollerable in themselves, but as they might be made in those broken and unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled times an occasion of falling, before men could be fully instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the right use of them; as appears plainly by these passages, <hi>viz. Our Images also have been, and be, (and if they be publickly suffered in Churches, and Chappels) ever will be also worshipped, and so Idolatry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them,</hi> p. 13. <hi>So hard it is, and indeed impossible any long time to have Images publickly in Churches and Temples without Idolatry,</hi> fol. 33. And finally by the passage which before we touched at, where after much vehemency, not only against Idolatry and Worshipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but also against Idols and Images themselves, the heats thereof are qualified by this expression, <hi>viz, I mean alwayes thus herein, in that we be stirred and provoked by them, to worship them; and not as though they were simply forbidden by the New Testament, without such occasion and danger,</hi> ibid. fol. 39. And thereupon it is first alledged by those of contrary judgment, that all such as lived in times of Popery, being long since dead, and the people of this last age sufficiently instructed in the unlawfulness of worshipping such painted Images, they may be lawfully used in Churches, without fear of Idolatry, which seems to have been the main inducement for their first defacing. Secondly, Many of the Eastern Churches, which notwithstanding do abominate the Superstitions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> retained the use of painted Images, though they reject those which were cut, and carved. Thirdly, That <hi>Images</hi> are still used in the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, upon which our first Reformers had a special eye; and that <hi>Luther</hi> much reproved <hi>Carolostadius</hi> for taking them out of such Churches, where before they had been suffered to stand, letting him know, <hi>Ex mentibus homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num potius removendas,</hi> that the worship of Images, was rather to be taken out of mens mindes by diligent and painful preaching, then the Images themselves to be so rashly, and unadvisedly cast out of the Churches. That painted Images were not only retained in the Chappels of the Queen, and of many great men of the Realm, in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54785:10"/>
most of the Cathedral Churches, and in some private Churches and Chappels also, without any defacing (witness the curious painted Glass in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Parish Church of <hi>Faireford</hi> in the County of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and the Chappel of the Holy Ghost, near <hi>Basingstoke</hi>) but a rich and massy Crucifix was kept for many years together, on the Table or Altar of the Chappel Royal in <hi>Whitehal</hi> (as appears by <hi>Saunders</hi> and <hi>Du Chesne</hi>) till it was broke in pieces by <hi>Pach,</hi> the Queens Fool (when no wiser man could be got to do it) upon the secret instigation of Sir <hi>Francis Knollis</hi>: and finally, it appears by the Queens Injunctions, that the Priests being command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to extol the dignity of any Images, Relicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diligently to teach, that all Goodness, Health, and Grace ought to be asked and looked for only at the hands of God, whereby all Superstition might be taken out of their hearts, the Images might lawfully remain as well in publick Churches, as in private Houses, as they had done formerly.</p>
            <p n="16">16. As for the times of publick Worship, we must behold them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> in their <hi>Institution,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Lords Day built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same foundation with the other Holy dayes,</note> and their <hi>Observation.</hi> And first, as for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution it is agreed on of all hands, that the Annual Feasts, Saints Dayes, or Holy Dayes, as now commonly called, do stand on no other ground then the Authority of the Church, which at first or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them; some in one age, and some in another, till they grow unto so great a number, that it was thought fit by King <hi>Henry</hi> viii. and afterwards by King <hi>Edward</hi> vi. to abolish such of them as might best be spared. Nor stands the Sunday, or Lords Day (according to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) on any other ground then the rest of the Holy dayes; for in the Homily touching the time and place of Prayer,<note place="margin">according to the Book of Homilies,</note> it is thus doctrinally resolved, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>As concerning the time in which God hath appointed his people to assemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther solemnly, it doth appear by the fourth Commandment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Example and Commandment of God, the godly Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an people began to follow, after the <hi>Ascension</hi> of our Lord Christ, and began to chuse them a standing day in the week to come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in; yet not the seventh day, which the Jews kept, but the Lords day,<note place="margin">and</note> the day of the Lords <hi>Resurrection,</hi> the day after the seventh day, which is the first day of the week, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
This makes the matter clear enough, and yet the Statute 5 and 6 of <hi>Edw.</hi> vi. in which all the Prelates did concur with the other Estates, makes it clearer then the <hi>Homily</hi> doth
<q>Forasmuch (saith the Statute) as men be not at all times so mindeful to laud and praise God,<note place="margin">The Act of Parliament, 5.6 of EDW. vi.</note> so ready to resort to hear Gods holy Word, and come to the holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as their bounden duty doth require; therefore to call men to remembrance of their duty, and to help their infirmities, it hath been wholesomely provided, that there should be some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dayes and times appointed wherein Christians should <hi>cease from all kindes of labour,</hi> and apply themselves only and wholly unto the aforesaid holy works properly pertaining to true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54785:11"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.

Less <hi>Power</hi> then this, as good Subjects could not give unto their King, so more then this hath there not been exercised or desired by the Kings of <hi>England.</hi> Such power as was by God vouchsafed to the godly Kings and Princes in Holy Scripture may serve abundantly to satisfie even the unlimited desires of the mightiest <hi>Monarch,</hi> were they as boundless as the <hi>Popes.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Justification how divided betwixt Faith and Works,</note> the breach was wider at the first breakings out of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> then it hath been since: <hi>Luther</hi> ascribing <hi>Iustification unto Faith</hi> alone, without relation unto <hi>Works</hi>; and those of <hi>Rome</hi> ascribing it to good <hi>Works</hi> alone, without relation unto <hi>Faith,</hi> which they rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned only amongst the <hi>preparatives</hi> unto it. But when the point had been long canvased, and the first heats were somewhat cooled, they began to come more neer unto one another. For when the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> attributed <hi>Iustification</hi> unto <hi>Works</hi> alone, they desired to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of such good <hi>Works</hi> as proceeded from a true and lively <hi>Faith</hi>: and when the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ascribed it to <hi>Faith</hi> alone, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to be understood of such a <hi>Faith</hi> as was productive of good <hi>Works,</hi> and attended by them.

               <q>That we are accounted righteous before God, only for the Merits of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> by Faith, and not for our own works or deservings.</q>
Which Justification by Faith only is further declared to be a most wholesome Doctrine, and very full of comfort;<note place="margin">and</note> for which we are referred to the Book of <hi>Homilies.</hi> And in the Book of <hi>Homilies</hi> we shall also finde,<note place="margin">In what to Works.</note>

Which being so, it may be well affirmed without any wrong <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXX"/> to Faith,<note place="margin">Of the efficacy of good Works,</note> that good Works are necessary to salvation; and not so on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but that they are <hi>efficienter necessaria,</hi> as was maintained pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in the Schools of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> though it was much carpt at by some men that did not rightly and distinctly understand the term.<note place="margin">and</note> And secondly, It may be said without any wrong to the <hi>Free Grace and Merits</hi> of Almighty God, that a reward is due for the <hi>Works of Righteousness,</hi> proceeding from a <hi>lively Faith,</hi> in a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate;<note place="margin">The Reward belonging to them,</note> not that the Church ascribeth any merit to the works of man, which may deserve eternal life, either <hi>ex congruo,</hi> or <hi>condigno,</hi> as the School-men phrase it; for <hi>Deus non coronat in nobis merita nostra sed dona sua,</hi> as the Father hath it.

<q>That at Christs coming unto Judgemenr all men shall rise again with their bodies, and give an account of their own works, that they which have done good shall go into life everlasting, and they that have done evil into everlasting fire.</q>
And secondly, It appears as plainly by the Collect for the 25. Sunday after Trinity, where the Church called on the Lord,

            <p n="32">32. Now, that such was the Doctrine of the first <hi>Reformers,</hi> may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXII"/> be made evident by the <hi>Definition</hi> of <hi>Predestination.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation how defined.</note>
               <q>Predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto life (saith the 17. Article) is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby, (before the foundations of the world were laid) he hath constantly declared by his Council, secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation, those whom he hath chosen in Christ out of mankinde, and to bring them by Christ to everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation.</q>
In which <hi>Definition</hi> there are these things to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served; First,<note place="margin">The definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on explicated.</note> That <hi>Predestination</hi> doth pre-suppose a curse or a state of Damnation, in which all mankinde was presented to the sight of God. Secondly, That it is an act of his from everlasting, because from everlasting he foresaw that misery into which wretched man would fall. Thirdly, That he founded it, and resolved for it in the Man and Mediator Christ Jesus, both for the purpose and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. Fourthly, That it was of some special ones alone, <hi>Elect, called forth,</hi> and <hi>reserved in Christ,</hi> and not generally extended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all mankinde. Fifthly, That being thus elected in Christ, they shall be brought by Christ to everlasting salvation. And sixthly, That this Council is secret unto us; for though there be revealed to us some hopeful signes of our <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Predestination unto life:</hi> yet the certainty thereof is a secret hidden in God, and in this life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us. Nothing obscure in this Definition but these words, <hi>Whom he hath chosen in Christ</hi>;<note place="margin">The explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on justified by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers,</note> which being the very words of the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. are generally interpreted by the ancient Fathers, of those who <hi>do believe in Christ,</hi> For thus St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> amongst others, <hi>Sicut elegit nos in ipso,</hi> as he hath chosen us in him; <hi>Prescius enim Deus omnes scit qui credituri essent in Christum,</hi> For God (saith he) by his general Presence did fore-know every man that would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Christ: The like saith <hi>Chrysostom</hi> on the Text. And that our first Reformers did conceive so,<note place="margin">By Bishop LATIMER,</note> it appears by that of Bishop <hi>Latimer</hi> in his Sermon on the third Sunday after the <hi>Epiphany,</hi>
               <q>When (saith he) we hear that some be <hi>chosen,</hi> and some be <hi>damned,</hi> let us have good <hi>hope,</hi> that we be among the <hi>chosen,</hi> and live after this <hi>hope,</hi> that is uprightly and godly; then shall we not be deceived. Think that God hath chosen those that <hi>believe in Christ</hi>; and Christ is the <hi>Book of Life:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">and</note> If thou believest in him, then art thou written in the <hi>Book of Life,</hi> and shall be saved.</q>
Secondly, The Doctrine of <hi>Predestination,</hi> as before laid down, may be further proved out of the last clause of the said 17. Article,<note place="margin">The last clause of the 17th. Article.</note> where it is said,
<q>That we must receive Gods promises in such wise as they be generally set forth to us in holy Scripture; and that in all our doings, that will of God is to be followed, which we have expresly declared to us in the word of God.</q>
Then which nothing can be more repugnant to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54785:19"/>
the Doctrine of <hi>Predestination,</hi> delivered by the <hi>Contra-Remonstrants</hi> (whither <hi>Supra-lapsarian,</hi> or <hi>Sub-lapsarian,</hi> is no great matter) which restrains <hi>Predestination unto Life</hi> to a few particulars, without respect had to their <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> or to <hi>Christs</hi> Sufferings and Death for them: which few particulars so <hi>predestinated</hi> to life eternal, shall (as they teach us) by an irresistable Grace, be brought to God, and by the infallible conduct of the Holy Spirit, be preserved from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from grace and favour.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Church why silent in the point of Reprobation.</note> but in the point of <hi>Reprobation</hi> or <hi>Predestination</hi> unto death, she is utterly silent; leaving it to be gathered upon <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical</hi> Inferences from that which is delivered by her in the point of <hi>Election</hi> (for <hi>Contrariorum contraria est ratio,</hi> as <hi>Logicians</hi> say) though that which is so gathered ought rather to be called, a <hi>Dereliction,</hi> then a <hi>Reprobation.</hi> No such <hi>absolute irreversible,</hi> and <hi>irrespective</hi> decree of <hi>Reprobation</hi> taught or maintained in any publick Monument or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by which the far greatest part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde are prae-ordained (and consequently prae-condemned to the pit of Torments, without respect had unto their sins, as the <hi>Supra-lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarians,</hi> or to their credulities, as generally is maintained by the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsarians</hi> in the Schools of <hi>Calvin.</hi> Much I am sure there is against it in the Writings of Bishop <hi>Hooper,</hi>

               <q>That <hi>Cain</hi> was no more excluded from the promise of <hi>Christ,</hi> till he exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himself, then <hi>Abel; Saul,</hi> then <hi>David; Iudas,</hi> then <hi>Peter; Esau,</hi> then <hi>Iacob:</hi> that God is said to have hated <hi>Esau,</hi> not because he was dis-inherited of eternal Life, but in <hi>laying his Mountains and his Heritage waste for the Dragons of the Wilderness,</hi> Mal. 1.3. That the threatnings of God against <hi>Esau,</hi> (if he had not of his wilful malice excluded himself from the promise of Grace) should no more have hindered his Salvation, then Gods <hi>threatnings</hi> against <hi>Ninive,</hi> &amp;c, That it is not a Christian mans part to say, That God hath written fatal Laws, as the <hi>stoick,</hi> and with necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of destiny, violently pulleth the one by the hair into <hi>Heaven,</hi> and thrusteth the other head-long into <hi>Hell</hi>; that the cause of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> or <hi>Damnation</hi> is sin in man, which will not hear, neither receive the promise of the Gospel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
And in a Sermon on the third Sunday after <hi>Epiphany,</hi>
               <note place="margin">By Bishop LATIMER,</note> we finde Bishop <hi>Latimer</hi> speaking thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That if the most are damned, the fault is not in God, but in themselves; for <hi>Deus vult omnes homines salvos fieri,</hi> God would that all men should be saved, but they themselves procure their own <hi>damnation,</hi> and despise the <hi>Passion</hi> of Christ by their wicked and inordinate living.</q>

<q>That Christ suffered, was Crucified, Dead, and Buried, to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> not only for Original Guilt, but also for the actual sins of men.

A clearer comment on which Text we cannot possibly have (as to the understanding of the Churches meaning) then that which may be found in the publick Liturgy: For first in the authorized <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the party <hi>Catechized</hi> being asked what he doth learn in his belief, makes answer as to this particular, that <hi>he believes in God the Father,</hi>

Thirdly, By the Prayer of <hi>Consecration</hi> before the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> viz.
<q>Almighty God our heavenly Father, which of thy tender mercy didst give thy only Son <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to suffer death upon the Cross for our <hi>Redemption,</hi> who made there (by his own Oblation of himself once offered) a full, perfect, and sufficient Sacrifice, Oblation, and Satisfaction for the sins of the <hi>WHOLE WORLD,</hi> &amp;c.</q>

But on the other side, if neither in his own person, or by the diligence and activity of his <hi>subservient Ministers,</hi> he acted or suffered any thing to be justified in point of Practice, or allowed any thing to be Preached or Prayed, or hindred any thing from being Published or Preached, but what may be made good by the Rules of the Church, and the complexion of the times in which he lived; those foul Reproaches, which so unjustly and uncharitably have been laid upon him, must return back upon the Authors, from whom they came, as stones thrown up against the Heavens, do many times fall upon the heads of those that threw them. But whither side deserved the blame for innovating in the Doctrine, Rites, and Ceremonies of the <hi>Anglican</hi> Church, according to the first Principles and Positions of it; will best appear by the course of the ensuing History, Relation being had to this Introduction, which I have here placed in the front, as a Lamp or Candle (such as we find commonly in the Porches of Great Mens houses) to light the way to such as are desirous to go into them, that they may enter with delight, converse therein with pleasure, and return with safety.</p>

                     <hi>William Laud</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was born on the 7th. day of <hi>October, An.</hi> 1573. A year remarkable for the buslings of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, who before they had served an Apprentiship in the Trade of Sedition, began to set up for themselves; and seeing they could not have the countenance of Authority, to justifie the advancing of their Holy Discipline, resolved to introduce it by little and little, as opportunity should be given them; which they did accordingly. His <hi>Birth place, Reading,</hi> the principal Town of <hi>Berks,</hi> for Wealth and Beauty; remarkable heretofore for a stately and magnificent <hi>Abby,</hi> founded and liberally Endowed by King <hi>Henry</hi> I. and no less eminent in these last Ages for the Trade of Clothing, the Seminary of some Families of Gentry within that County. And of this Trade his Father was, who kept not only many <hi>Lomes</hi> in his house, but many <hi>Weavers, Spinners,</hi> and <hi>Fullers,</hi> at continual work; living in good Esteem and Reputation amongst his Neighbours to the very last. His Mother <hi>Lucy Webb,</hi> was Sister to Sir <hi>William Webb</hi> Lord Maior of <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1591. the Grand-Father of Sir <hi>William Webb</hi> not long since deceased: She was first Marryed to <hi>Iohn Robinson</hi> a Clothier of the same Town also; but a Man of so good Wealth and Credit, that he Marryed one of his Daughters to Dr. <hi>Cotsford,</hi> and another unto Dr. <hi>Layfield,</hi> men of parts and worth; and left his youngest Son called <hi>William,</hi> in so good a way, that he came to be <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Divinity, Prebend</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and <hi>Archdeacon</hi> of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> beside some other prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he dyed possest of. Having buryed her Husband <hi>Iohn Robinson,</hi> she was Re-marryed unto <hi>Laud,</hi> this Archbishops Father, to whom she brought no other child than this Son alone; as if she had satisfied that duty which was owing to her second Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage bed, by bringing forth a Son, who was to be the Patriarch (in a manner) of the <hi>British Islands.</hi>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54785:26"/>
                     <hi>England.</hi> But granting that he had been born of as <hi>poor and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure Parents</hi> as those Authors make him; yet must it needs add to the commendation of his Parts and Industry, who from so mean and low a Birth, had raised himself into such an eminent height of Power and Glory, that no Bishop or Archbishop, since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, had attained the like. The greatest Rivers many times have the smallest Fountains, such as can hardly be found out, and being found out, as hardly quit the cost of the discovery; and yet by long running, and holding on a constant and continual course, they become large, navigable, and of great benefit unto the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Whereas some Families may be compared to the <hi>Pyramides</hi> of <hi>AEgypt,</hi> which being built on great Foundations, grow narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and narrower by degrees, until at last they end in a small <hi>Conus,</hi> in a point, in nothing. For if we look into the Stories of the Times foregoing, we shall find, that poor and obscure Cottages have bred Commanders to the Camp, Judges unto the Seats of Justice, Counsellors to the State, Peers to the Realm, and Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto the Throne, as well as <hi>Prelates</hi> to the Church: When such as do pretend to a Nobler Birth, do many times consume themselves in effeminate Luxuries, and waste their Fortunes in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal and Libidinous Course. Which brings into my mind the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer made by Mr. <hi>Pace</hi> (one of the Secretaries to King <hi>Hen.</hi> viii.) to a Nobleman about the Court; For when the said Nobleman had told him, in contempt of Learning, <hi>That it was enough for Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Sons to wind their</hi> Horn, <hi>and carry their</hi> Hawk <hi>fair, and to leave Study and Learning to the Children of mean men</hi>;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Camld. Rens. p.</hi> 273. last Edit.</note> Mr. <hi>Pace</hi> thereunto replied, <hi>Then his Lordship, and the rest of the Noblemen, must be content to leave unto the Sons of meaner Persons, the managing of Affairs of Estate; when their own Children please themselves with winding their</hi> Horns, <hi>and managing their</hi> Hawks, <hi>and other Follies of the Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet notwithstanding, such was the envy of the Times, that he was frequently upbraided in the days of his Greatness, as well (in common Speech) a scattered Libells, with the <hi>mean</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Birth. And I remember that I found him once in his Garden at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> with more than ordinary Trouble in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; of which not having confidence enough to enquire the Reason, he shewed me a Paper in his hand, and told me it was a printed Sheet of a Scandalous <hi>Libel</hi> which had been stopp'd at the Press, in which he found himself reproach'd with so base a Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as if he had been raked out of the Dunghil; adding withal, That though he had not the good fortune to be born a Gentleman, yet he thank'd God he had been born of honest Parents, who lived in a plentiful condition, employed many poor People in their way, and left a good report behind them. And thereupon beginning to clear up his Countenance, I told him as presently as I durst, That Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth, as stout a Pope as ever wore the Triple
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54785:27"/>
Crown, but a poor mans Son, did use familiarly to say, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of such <hi>Libells</hi> as frequently were made against him, That he was <hi>Domo natus Illustri,</hi> because the Sun-beams passing through the broken Walls and ragged Roof, <hi>illustrated</hi> every corner of that homely Cottage in which he was born; with which facetiousness of that Pope (so applicable to the present occasion) he seemed very well pleased.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1589.</note>But to go forwards with our Story. Having escaped a dangerous Sickness in his Childhood, he was trained up (as soon as he was sitted for it) in the Free Grammar-School of <hi>Reading</hi>; in which he profited so well, and came on so fast, that before he was sixteen years of age (which was very early for those times) he was sent to <hi>Oxon</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and entred a Commoner in St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Colledge, and there committed to the tuition of Mr. <hi>Buckeridge,</hi> one of the Fellows of that Colledge, and afterwards the worthy President of it. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no ordinary happiness to the Scholar, to be principled under such a <hi>Tutor,</hi> who knew as well as any other of his time, how to employ the two-edged Sword of Holy Scripture, of which he made good proof in the times succeeding, brandishing it on the one side against the <hi>Papists,</hi> and on the other against the <hi>Puritans</hi> or <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists.</hi> In reference to the first, it is said of him in the general by Bishop <hi>Godwin,</hi>

                  <p>Of this man I have spoken the more at large,<note place="margin">1590.</note> that finding the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the <hi>Tutor,</hi> we may the better judge of those ingredients which went to the making up of the <hi>Scholar.</hi> Having spent about a year in his Colledge, there was raised such a good report of him in the Town of <hi>Reading,</hi> that partly by his own proficiencies, and partly by the good esteem which was had of his Father, he was nominated by the Mayor and others of that Corporation unto a Scholars place in that House, according to the Constitutions of Sir <hi>Tho. White,</hi> the Honourable and sole Founder of it, who though he had designed the <hi>Merchant-Taylors</hi> School in <hi>London</hi> for the Chief Seminary of his Colledge, yet being a man of a more publick Spirit, than to confine himself to any one place, he allowed two Fellowships to the City of <hi>Coventry,</hi> and as many to <hi>Bristol,</hi> two also to the Town of <hi>Reading,</hi> and one to <hi>Tunbridg.</hi> Admitted a Scholar of the House on this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, at the end of three years (according to the Custom of that Colledge) he was made one of the Fellows,<note place="margin">1593.</note> taking his <hi>Academical</hi> Degrees according to that custom also; by which custom those of that Society are kept longer from taking their degrees in the Arts, but are permitted to take their Degrees in Divinity much sooner than in other Houses; so that although he proceeded not Master of Arts till the Month of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1599.<note place="margin">1599.</note> yet at the end of five years only he took the Degree of <hi>Batchelour</hi> in <hi>Divinity,</hi> without longer stay; during which interval he was first made <hi>Deacon,</hi> and afterwards was put into the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Priesthood</hi> by Dr. <hi>Young</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> the See of <hi>Oxon.</hi> being vacant, in which vacancy it had continued for the space of 11. years, that is to say, from the death of Bishop <hi>Vnderhill, An.</hi> 1592. till the Consecration of Dr. <hi>Bridges</hi> on the twelfth of <hi>February, An.</hi> 1603. The Patrimony of that Church being in the mean time much dilapidated and made a prey (for the most part) to the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:54785:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                  <p>And now being fallen upon his Studies in Divinity, in the exercise whereof he met with some affronts and oppositions, it will be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to take a short view of the then present Estate of that University, that so we may the better discern the Reasons of those affronts and oppositions under which he suffered. Know then, that Mr. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Humphrey,</hi> one of the Fellows of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge, being deprived of his Fellowship there in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, betook himself to the City of <hi>Zurich,</hi> a City of chiefest note amongst the <hi>Switzers,</hi> remarkable for the Preachings and Death of <hi>Zuinglius</hi>; from whence, and from the Correspondence which he had at <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> he brought back with him at his returning into <hi>England</hi> on Queen <hi>Maries</hi> death, so much of the <hi>Calvinian,</hi> both in Doctrine and in Discipline, that the best that could be said of him, by <note n="(f)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Full. Hist. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 234.</note> one who commonly speaks favourably of all that Party, is, that he was <hi>a moderate and conscientious Non-conformist.</hi> Immediately on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn he was by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> made <hi>President</hi> of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and found to be the fittest man (as certainly he was a man of very good parts, and the Master of a pure Latin Style) for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Divinity Chair,</hi> as her Majesties <hi>Professor</hi> in that <hi>Faculty</hi>; in which he continued till the year 1596. and for a great part of that time was <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> also. By which advantages he did not only stock his Colledge with such a generation of <hi>Non-conformists</hi> as could not be wormed out in many years after his decease; but sowed in the Divinity Schools such seeds of <hi>Calvinism,</hi> and laboured to create in the younger Students such a strong hate against the Papists, as if nothing but Divine Truths were to be found in the one, and nothing but Abominations to be seen in the other. And though Doctor <hi>Iohn Holland</hi> Rector of <hi>Exceter</hi> Colledge, who succeeded <hi>Humphries</hi> in the <hi>Chair,</hi> came to it better principled than his Predecessor, yet did he suffer himself to be borne away by the violent current of the times, contrary in some cases to his own opinion.</p>
                  <p>And yet as zealous as Doctor <hi>Humphries</hi> shewed himself against the <hi>Papists</hi> (insomuch as he got the title of a <hi>Papisto Mastyx</hi>) he was not thought, though seconded by the Lady <hi>Margarets</hi> Professor for that University, to make the distance wide enough betwixt the Churches. A new Lecture therefore must be founded by Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham</hi> Principal Secretary of Estate, a man of Great Abilities in the Schools of <hi>Policy,</hi> an extreme hater of the <hi>Popes</hi> and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and no less favourable unto those of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction. The designe was to make the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> more odious, and the differences betwixt them and the <hi>Protestants</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more irreconcileable than before they did. And that he might not fail of his purpose in it, the Reading of this Lecture was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Doctor <hi>Iohn Reynolds</hi> President of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Colledge, a man of infinite Reading, and as vast a Memory; who having lived
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54785:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sometimes in one of our <hi>English</hi> Seminaries beyond the Seas, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himself as profest a <hi>Papist,</hi> and as eager in the pursuit of that way, as any other whatsoever: But being regained unto this Church by his Brother <hi>William,</hi> who lost himself in the encounter, he thought he could not sufficiently express his detestation of the errors and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but by running to the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, and making himself considerable amongst the <hi>Puritans.</hi> On which account, as he became very gracious to Sir <hi>Francis Walsing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> so was he quickly made the Spiritual Head of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; in which capacity he managed their business for them in the Conference at <hi>Hampton Court, Anno</hi> 1603. where he appeared the principal if not only Speaker, the other three (that is to say, <hi>Spark, Chadderton,</hi> and <hi>Knewstubs</hi>) serving no otherwise than as Mutes and Cyphers to make up the mess.</p>
                  <p>By the power and practices of these men, the disposition of those times, and the long continuance of the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> (the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Patron of that Faction) in the place of <hi>Chancellor,</hi> the face of that University was so much altered, that there was little to be seen in it of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> according to the Principles and Positions upon which it was at first Reformed. All the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Rigors in matters of <hi>Predestination,</hi> and the Points depending thereupon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as the Established Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; the necessity of the one Sacrament, the eminent dignity of the other, and the powerful efficacy of both unto mans salvation, not only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed, but denyed; the Article of Christs <hi>local descent into hell,</hi> so positively asserted in two Convocations, <hi>Anno</hi> 1552. and 1562. at first corrupted with false Glosses, afterwards openly contradicted, and at last totally disclaimed, because repugnant to the Fancies of some Forreign Divines, though they at odds amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the meaning of it; <hi>Episcopacy</hi> maintained by halves, not as a distinct <hi>Order</hi> from that of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but only a <hi>degree</hi> above them, or perhaps not that, for fear of giving scandal to the Churches of <hi>Calvins Platform</hi>; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> inveighed against as the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> or the <hi>Mother of Abominations;</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> as publickly maintained to be <hi>Antichrist,</hi> or the Man of Sin, and that as positively and magisterially as if it had been one of the chief Articles of the Christian Faith; and then for fear of having any good thoughts for either, the visibility of the Church must be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise maintained, than by looking for it in the scattered <hi>Conventicles</hi> of the <hi>Berengarians</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Albigenses</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Huffites</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the <hi>Wickliffists</hi> among our selves. Nor was there any greater care taken for the <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> of this Church, than there had been for points of Doctrine, the Surplice so disused in offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating the Divine Service of the Church, and the Divine Service of the Church so slubbered over in most of the Colledges, that the <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> assembled in <hi>Convocation, Anno</hi> 1603. were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated to frame two <hi>Canons,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Can.</hi> 16, 17. to bring

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54785:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to bring her back again to her native Principles. But then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, it was as easie to discern how desperate an attempt it must needs appear for a single man, unseconded, and not well befriended, to oppose himself against an Army; how vain a thing to strive against so strong a stream, and cross the current of the times; that the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease by long neglect was grown so natural and habitual, that more mischief might be feared from the Medicine, than from the Malady; that he must needs expose himself to many Censures and Reproaches, and possibly to some danger also by the undertaking. But these last considerations being weighed in the Scale of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> appeared so light, that he was resolved to try his fortune in the work, and to leave the issue thereof unto God, by whom <hi>Paul's planting</hi> and <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo's watering do receive increase</hi>?</p>
                  <p>For being thus resolved upon the point,<note place="margin">1602.</note> it was not long before he had an opportunity to set it forwards. He had before attained unto an high esteem for Arts and Oratory, and was conceived to have made so good a proficiency in the Studies of Divinity also, that in the year 1602. he was admitted to read the Lecture of Mrs. <hi>May's</hi> Foundation, with the general liking of that Colledge. With the like general consent and approbation he was chosen out of all the rest of that Society to be a <hi>Candidate</hi> for the <hi>Proctorship</hi> in the University, into which Office he was chosen on the fourth of <hi>May,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1603.</note> 1603. which was as soon as he was capable of it by the University Statutes; which Office he discharged with great applause as to himself, and general satisfaction unto others. Doctor <hi>George Abbot</hi> Master of <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi> Colledge (who afterwards attained to the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) was at that time <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> of the University, whom with the rest of the Doctors and <hi>Heads</hi> of Houses he accompanied to <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stock</hi> Manor, to present themselves and tender their most humble ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the most Mighty Prince King <hi>Iames,</hi> succeeding on the 24th. of <hi>March</hi> before to the Crown of <hi>England</hi>: And in this year it was (but whether in reading of the Lecture of Mrs. <hi>May's</hi> Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or some other <hi>Chappel Exercise,</hi> I am not able to say) he maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the constant and perpetual <hi>visibility</hi> of the Church of Christ, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Apostles to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> continued in that Church (as in others of the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>South</hi>) till the <hi>Reformation.</hi> Dr. <hi>Abbot</hi> Master of <hi>Vniversity</hi> Colledg, and <hi>Vice-chancellor,</hi> was of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opinion, and could not finde any such visibility of the Christian Church, but by tracing it as well as he could from the <hi>Berengarians</hi> to the <hi>Albigenses,</hi> from the <hi>Albigenses</hi> to the <hi>Wickliffists,</hi> from the <hi>Wickliffists</hi> unto the <hi>Hussites,</hi> and from the <hi>Hussites</hi> unto <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin;</hi> for proof whereof, we may consult a Book of his, entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Visibility of the Church,</hi> published in those busie Times when this impertinent Question, <hi>viz. Where Was your Church before Luther</hi>? was as impertinently insisted on by the Priests and Jesuites. This being his opinion also when he lived in <hi>Oxon,</hi> he thought it a great derogation to his Parts and Credit, that any man should dare
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54785:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to maintain the contrary, and thereupon conceived a strong grudge against him, which no tract of time could either abolish or diminish.</p>
                  <p>In the next year, <hi>viz.</hi> 1604. he peformed his Exercise for <hi>Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of Divinity,</hi> in which he maintained these two Points: First, <hi>The</hi> necessity <hi>of Baptism:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1604.</note> Secondly, <hi>That there could be no true Church without</hi> Diocesan <hi>Bishops:</hi> For which last he was shrewdly ratled by Doctor <hi>Holland</hi> above-mentioned, as one that did endeavour to cast a bone of Discord betwixt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches beyond the Seas; and for the first it was objected, That he had taken the greatest part of his <hi>Supposition</hi> out of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> Works, as if the Doctrine of the Incarnation of the Son of God, or any necessary Truths, were to be renounced because they are defended by that Learned Cardinal. But misfortunes seldom come alone, if at the least it may be counted a misfortune to be reproach'd for standing up in defence of truth: For not long after, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1606. he was questioned by Dr. <hi>Airy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1606.</note> being <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> for that year, for a Sermon preached in St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church on the 26th. of <hi>October,</hi> as containing in it sundry scandalous and <hi>Popish</hi> passages; the good man taking all things to be matter of <hi>Popery,</hi> which were not held forth unto him in <hi>Calvins Institutes</hi>; conceiving that there was as much Idolatry in <hi>bowing at the Name of IESVS,</hi> as in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping the <hi>brasen Serpent,</hi> and as undoubtedly believing that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> was begotten on the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as that <hi>Pharez</hi> and <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> were begotten on the body of <hi>Tamar.</hi> Which advantage being taken by Doctor <hi>Abbot,</hi> he so violently persecuted the poor man, and so openly branded him for a <hi>Papist,</hi> or at least very <hi>Popishly</hi> encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that it was almost made an <hi>Heresie</hi> (as I have heard from his own mouth) for any one to be seen in his company, and a <hi>misprision</hi> of <hi>Heresie</hi> to give him a civil Salutation as he walked the Streets. But there will one day come a time, when Doctor <hi>Abbot</hi> may be made more sensible of these Oppressions, when he shall see this poor despised man standing upon the higher ground, and more above him in respect of Power, than beneath in Place: So unsafe a thing it is for them that be in Authority to abuse their Power, and carry mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on to the last extremities, as if they had <hi>Fortune</hi> in a string, and could be sure to lead her with them whithersoever they went.</p>
                  <p>This scandal being raised at <hi>Oxon,</hi> it was not long before it flew to <hi>Cambridge</hi> also, at what time Mr. <hi>Ioseph Hall</hi> (who died Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> about the year 1657.) was exercising his Pen in the way of Epistles,<note place="margin">

Neither could he have taken those Degrees (had it been so with him) without a most perfidious dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation before God and Man; because in taking those Degrees, he must both take the Oath of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and subscribe to the three Articles contained in the 36 <hi>Canon</hi> of the year 1603. In the first of which he was to have abjured the Popes Authority, and in the next to have declared his approbation of the Doctrine, Government, and Forms of Worship established in the Church of <hi>England</hi>: Which may sufficiently serve to over-balance the Depositions of Sir <hi>Nath.

His Fellowship was not so considerable, but that he might presume of a larger Maintenance beyond the Seas: Nor was he of such common parts, but that he might have looked for a better welcom, and far more civil usage there than he found at home. Preferments in the Church he had none at the present, nor any strong presumptions of it for the time to come, which might be a temptation to him to continue here against the clear light of his Understanding. And this may be a further Argument, not only of his unfeigned sincerity, but of his constancy and stedfastness in the Religion here established, that he kept his station; that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all those clamours under which he suffered, he was resolved to ride out the storm, and neither to desert the Barque in which he sailed, nor run her upon any of the <hi>Roman Shores.</hi> In this of a far better Temper than <hi>Tertullian</hi> was, though as much provok'd, of whom it is reported by <hi>Beatus Rhenamus,</hi> That at first he only seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to favour <hi>Montanus,</hi> or at the least not to be displeased with his proceedings: But afterwards being continually tormented by the tongues and pens of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, <note n="(m)" place="margin">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54785:31"/>
Order of the <hi>Garter.</hi> This Gentleman being a younger Brother of <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> and known only by the name of Sir <hi>Charles Blunt,</hi> while his Brother lived, had bore a strong and dear affection to the Lady <hi>Penelope</hi> Daughter of <hi>Walter</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> a Lady in whom lodged all attractive Graces of Beauty, Wit, and sweetness of Behaviour, which might render her the absolute Mistress of all Eyes and Hearts. And she so far reciprocated with him in the like affection (being a compleat and gallant man) that some assurances past between them of a future Marriage. But her friends looking on him as a younger Brother, considerable only in his depending at the Court, chose rather to dispose her in Marriage to <hi>Robert</hi> Lord <hi>Rich,</hi> a man of an independent Fortune, and a known Estate, but otherwise of an uncourtly disposition, unsociable, austere, and of no very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conversation to her. Against this <hi>Blunt</hi> had nothing to plead in Bar, the promises which passed between them being made in private, no Witnesses to attest unto it, and therefore not amounting to a pre-Contract in due form of Law.</p>
                  <p>But long she had not lived in the Bed of <hi>Rich,</hi> when the old flames of her affection unto <hi>Blunt</hi> began again to kindle in her, and if the Sonet in the <hi>Arcadia, (A Neighbour mine not long ago there was, &amp;c.)</hi> be not too generally misconstrued, she made her Husband the sole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument to acquaint him with it: But whether it were so or not, certain it is, that having first had their private meetings, they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards converst more openly and familiarly with one another, than might stand with honour unto either; especially when by the death of his elder Brother, the Title of Lord <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> and the Estate remaining to it, had accrued unto him: As if the alteration of his Fortune could either lessen the offence, or suppress the <hi>fame.</hi> Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, at his coming back from the Wars of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be free from <hi>Rich,</hi> legally freed by a Divorce, and not a voluntary separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only, <hi>a toro &amp; mensa,</hi> as they call it; he thought himself obliged to make her some Reparation in point of Honour, by taking her into his Bosom as a Lawful Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Besides, he had some Children by her, before she was actually separated from the Bed of <hi>Rich</hi> (some of which afterwards attained to Titles of Honour) whom he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he might have put into a capability of a Legitimation, by this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent Marriage, according to the Rule and Practice of the Civil Laws, in which it passeth for a Maxime, That <hi>subsequens Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium legitimat prolem.</hi> And to that end he dealt so powerfully with his Chaplain, that he disposed him to perform the Rites of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization, which was accordingly done at <hi>Wansteed, Decemb.</hi> 26. being the Festival of St. <hi>Steven, Anno</hi> 1605.</p>
                  <p>Nor did he want some Reasons to induce him to it (besides the perswasion of his Friends) which might have gained upon a man not so much concerned in it as he was, and may be used for his excuse, if not for his justification also. He found by the averment of the Parties, that some assurances of Marriage had passed between them,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54785:32"/>
before she was espoused to <hi>Rich</hi>; which though they could not amount to a pre-Contract <hi>in Foro Iudicii,</hi> in a Court of Judicature; yet he might satisfie himself in the truth thereof <hi>in Foro Conscientiae,</hi> in the Court of his own private Conscience: And thereupon he might conclude, That being satisfied in the reality and truth of those Assurances, and finding that <hi>Rich</hi> had quitted his pretensions to her by a formal Sentence of Divorce, he might conceive it lawful for him to perform that Service which was required at his hands. He had found also three Opinions touching the lawfulness or unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of such Marriages, which are made after a Divorce: The first, <hi>That such Marriages are lawful unto neither Party, as long as either of them liveth</hi>; which is the Doctrine of the <hi>Papists,</hi> determined posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi>: The second, <hi>That such Marriages are lawful to the Party wronged, but not unto the Guilty also</hi>; which Opinion is maintained by some of the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> and divers of the Ancient Writers: The third, <hi>That both the innocent and the guilty Party may lawfully marry if they please;</hi> which <hi>Maldonate</hi>

                  <p>But whatsoever motives either of them had to put a fair colour upon the business, certain it is, that it succeeded well with neither: The Earl found presently such an alteration in the Kings countenance towards him, and such a lessening of the value which formerly had been set upon him, that he was put to a necessity of writing an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to defend his action: But finding how little it edified both in Court and Country, it wrought such a sad impression on him, that he did not much survive the mischief, ending his life before the end of the year next following. Nor did the Chaplain brook it long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such a check of Conscience, as made him turn the Annual Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of St. <hi>Steven</hi> into an Anniversary Fast, humbling himself from year to year upon that day before the Father of Mercies, and craving pardon for that Error which by the perswasions of some Friends, and other the temptations of flesh and blood, he had fallen into. And for this purpose he composed this ensuing Prayer.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Devonshire</hi> being dead, he was by Doctor <hi>Buckridge</hi> his most constant friend (<hi>Anno</hi> 1608.) commended to the Service of Doctor <hi>Richard Neile,</hi>

Duncum</hi> one of the Prebends of <hi>Durham</hi> also, Mr. <hi>Barlow</hi> a right solid man, but not possessed of any Dignity in the Church to my best remembrance; and some others of good note, whose Names and Titles I cannot presently call to minde. In the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Iames</hi> (by the power and mediation of Archbishop <hi>Bancroft</hi>) he was made Clerk of the Closet to that King, that standing continually at his Elbow, he might be ready to perform good offices to the Church and Churchmen: Aud he discharged his trust so well, that though he lost the love of some of the Courtiers, who were too visibly enclined to the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, yet he gained the favour of his Master, by whom he was preferred to the <hi>Deanry</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and afterwards successively to the Bishopricks of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, Litchfield, Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Durham,</hi> one of the richest in the Kingdom; which shews that there was in him something more than ordinary, which made that King so bountiful and gracious to him. Nor staid he there, but by the Power and Favour of this his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, he was promoted in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> to the See of <hi>Winton,</hi> and finally exalted to the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> See of <hi>York,</hi> where at last he died about the latter end of <hi>October</hi> 1640. None of his Chaplains received so much into his Counsels as Doctor <hi>Laud</hi> (to which degree he was admitted in the year 1608.) whom he found both an active and a trusty Servant, as afterwards a most constant and faithful friend upon all occasions.</p>
                  <p>The first Ecclesiastical Preferment which fell unto him was the Vicaridge of <hi>Stamford</hi> in <hi>Northamptonshire</hi>: But having put himself into the Service of Bishop <hi>Neile,</hi> he was by him preferred into the Rectory of <hi>Cuckstone</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1610.</note> toward the latter end of <hi>May</hi> 1610. On the acceptance thereof he gave over his Fellowship in <hi>October</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, that so he might more fully apply himself to the service of his Lord and Patron. But <hi>Cuckstone</hi> proving an unhealthy place, he exchanged it for another called <hi>Norton</hi>; a Benefice of less value, but scituate in a better and more healthy Air: His Patron in the mean time being translated to the See of <hi>Litchfield</hi> on the end of <hi>September,</hi> whose Fortunes he was resolved to follow, till God should please to provide otherwise for him: For first the Bishop, before his going off from the Deanry of <hi>Westminster,</hi> which he held <hi>in commendam</hi> with his Bishoprick of <hi>Rochester,</hi> obtained for him of King <hi>Iames,</hi> (to whom not otherwise known but by his Recommendation) the Reversion of a <hi>Prebend</hi> in that Church; which though it fell not to him until ten years after, yet it fell at last, and thereby neighbour'd him to the Court. And on the other side, his good Friend and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Doctor <hi>Buckridge</hi> being nominated Successor unto <hi>Neile</hi> in the See of <hi>Rochester,</hi> laid a good ground for his Succession in the <hi>President<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Colledge, thereby to render him considerable in the University. But this was both suspected and feared by <hi>Abbot,</hi> who being consecrated Bishop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield</hi> on the third of <hi>December</hi> 1609. and from thence removed to <hi>London</hi> in the end of

                     <hi>Ianuary</hi> next ensuing, resolved to hinder the design with all care and diligence: So natural a thing it is to hate the man whom we have wronged; to keep him down, whom we have any cause to fear, when we have him under. To which end he made great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints against him to <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Elsmer,</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> many years before, and newly then made Chancellor of that University, on the death of the Lord Archbishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him, <hi>That he was at the least a</hi> Papist <hi>in heart, and cordially addicted unto</hi> Popery; <hi>That he kept company with none but profest and suspected</hi> Papists; and, <hi>That if he were suffered to have any place of Government in the Vniversity, it would undoubtedly turn to the great Detriment of Religion, and Dishonour of his Lordship.</hi> The Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor hereupon makes his Address unto the King, informing him of all which had been told him concerning <hi>Laud,</hi> which was like to have destroy'd his hopes as to that design (notwithstanding his petition to the King to believe otherwise of him) if Bishop <hi>Neile</hi> his constant and unmovable Friend, had not acquainted his Majesty with the Abilities of the man, and the old grudge which <hi>Abbot</hi> had conceived against him.</p>
                  <p>This Bar being thus removed,<note place="margin">1611.</note> the design for the Presidentship went on; in the obtaining whereof; he found a greater difficulty than he had expected: <hi>Rawlinson,</hi> once a Fellow of the same House, and afterwards Principal of St. <hi>Edmonds Hall,</hi> appearing a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor for it. Each of them having prepared his Party, the Fellows proceeded to an <hi>Election May</hi> 10. <hi>Anno</hi> 1611. The <hi>Scrutiny</hi> being made, and the <hi>Election</hi> at the point to be declared, one of the Fellows of <hi>Rawlinson</hi>'s Party, seeing which way the business was like to go, snatch'd up the Paper, and tore it suddenly in pieces. The Nomination being thus unhappily frustrated, an Appeal was made unto King <hi>Iames,</hi> who spent three hours in giving Audience to both parties; and upon full consideration of the Proofs and Allegations on either side (notwithstanding all the former practices and prejudices to encline him otherwise) he gave Sentence in behalf of <hi>Laud</hi>; which hapning on the 29th. of <hi>August,</hi> being the day of the beheading of St. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> by whose Name that Colledge was entituled by the Founder of it, hath given an occasion unto some to look upon it as an <hi>Omen</hi> or <hi>Prognostication,</hi> that this new Head should suffer death by being beheaded, as the other did. The King having thus passed Judgment for him, he was thereupon sworn, and admitted <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>; and being so sworn and admitted, he could not for example sake but inflict some punishment on the party who had torn the <hi>Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny</hi>: But knowing him for a man of hopeful Parts, industrious in his Studies, and of a Courage not to be disliked, he not only released him from the Censure under which he lay, but took him into spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Favour, trusted him in all his weighty businesses, made him his Chaplain, and preferred him from one good Benefice to another, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him to his Brothers Daughter, and finally promoted him to the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54785:34"/>
very <hi>Presidentship</hi> (which had been the first cause of that breach) and one of the best <hi>Deanries</hi> of the Kingdom. To such others of the Fellows as had opposed him in his Election to that place, he always shewed a fair and equal countenance, hoping to gain them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: But if he found any of them to be untractable, not easily to be gained by favours, he would finde some handsom way or other to remove them out of the Colledge, that others not engaged upon either side might succeed in their places. But notwithstanding all this care, the Faction still held up against him, the younger fry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to the same side which had been taken by their Tutors.</p>
                  <p>But whiles these things were in agitation, there hapned a great alteration in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by the death of the most Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Archbishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> who died on the second of <hi>November</hi> 1610. and with whom died the <hi>Vniformity</hi> of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> A man he was of eminent parts, and of a most undaunted spirit; one who well knew his work, and did it. When Chaplain only to the Lord <hi>Chancellor Hatton,</hi> he piec'd himself with Doctor <hi>Whitgift,</hi> not long after his first coming to the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to whom he proved a great support in gaining the Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> for him, by whose assistance he was enabled to hold out against the over-ruling Power of the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Leicester,</hi> the Patron-General of the Faction. In the year 1588. he Preached a Sermon at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross, and therein made an open Declaration of those manifold Dangers which the prevalency of that Faction would bring upon the Church and State, if they might be suffered; which blow he followed in a Book entituled, <hi>Dangerous Positions and Proceedings published and practised within this Island of</hi> Britain, <hi>under pretence of Reformation, and for the</hi> Presbyterial <hi>Discipline</hi>: And in that Book he made such a perfect discovery of their Plots and Practises, and so anatomized them in every part, that he made them odious unto those who before had been their greatest Patrons. In the year 1593. he published another Treatise, entituled, <hi>A Survey of the Pretended holy Discipline,</hi> in which he so dissected the whole Body of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s <hi>Presbyterial Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,</hi> shewing the incoherencies of it in it self, and the inconsistencies thereof with <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government, that he took off the edge of many (and those Great ones too) who had not only seemed to like it, but had longed for it: The Plot was so laid down by <hi>Whitgift,</hi> that at the same time there should come out two other Books, the one written by Doctor <hi>Thomas Bilson,</hi> Warden of the Colledge neer <hi>Winton,</hi> for proof of the Antiquity and perpetual Government of the Church by Bishops; the other by Doctor <hi>Richard Cosens</hi> a right Learned Civilian, in justification of the Proceedings in the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Courts. By which four Books the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction was so <hi>muzled,</hi> that they were not able to <hi>bark</hi> in a long time after: Nor do they want their several and just Rewards for such good perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, <hi>Bilson</hi> being first made Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Bishop of <hi>Winton, Bancroft</hi> advanced to the See of <hi>London,</hi> and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54785:34"/>
Doctor <hi>Cosens</hi> Vicar-general and Dean of the Arches, within few years after being consecrated Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> on the eighth of <hi>May</hi> 1597. he kept such a watchfull eye over it, and held so strict a hand upon it, that from a receptactle and retreat of the <hi>Grandees</hi> of the <hi>Puritan</hi> party, it became almost as free from Faction as any other in the Kingdom: And knowing how much the Peace of this Church did depend upon it, he managed a secret Corespondency with King <hi>Iames</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> insinuating unto him the necessity of conforming the Churches of both Kingdoms in Government and Forms of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and laying down a plot for restoring <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to that Kirk, without noise or trouble: Which counsel being advisedly followed by King <hi>Iames</hi> before his coming into <hi>England,</hi> was afterwards so well pursued (though not without some violent strugling of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of that Kingdom) that on the 21. day of <hi>October</hi> in the year 1609. the designed Bishops of <hi>Glascow, Brechen,</hi> and <hi>Gallo-Way</hi> received Episcopal Consecration in the Chappel of <hi>London</hi>-house, by the hands of Doctor <hi>George Abbot</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> Doctor <hi>Lancelot Andrews</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> Doctor <hi>Iames Montague</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Richard Neile</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Rochester; Bancroft</hi> himself forbearing to lay hands upon them, for the avoiding of all scruples amongst the <hi>Scots,</hi> as if he pretended any Jurisdiction or Authority over them.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. he carried a chief hand in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> and had the sole management of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> of the same year also, in which he passed that excellent body of <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Constitutions Ecclesiastical,</hi> to serve for a perpetual standing Rule to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Succeeding <hi>Whitgift</hi> in the See of <hi>Canterbury, Anno</hi> 1604. he resolved to put the <hi>Canons</hi> into execution, and press'd it with so stout a courage, that few had confidence enough to stand out against him: Some of them did, and those he either depriv'd or silenc'd, and thereby terrified the rest to an open Conformity. They saw too plainly that they must not dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his patience, as they did with <hi>Whitgifts</hi>; and that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to <hi>break</hi> them, if they would not <hi>bow:</hi> And they did wisely in so <hi>bowing;</hi> for who could stand against a man of such a spirit, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Authority, having the Law on his side, and the King to friend, who had declared publickly in the <note n="(p)" place="margin">

themselves with the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, how dearly soever the Church paid for it: And thereupon it was resolved to fix on <hi>Andrews</hi> for the man; a man, as one says very well of him, of Primitive Antiquity, in whom was to be found whatever is desirable in a Bishop, even to admiration;<note place="margin">

<q>That in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising of his Function he was conceived too facil and yielding: His extraordinary Remisness in not exacting strict Conformity to the prescribed Orders of the Church in point of Ceremonie, seemed to resolve those Legal Determinations to their first Principle of Indifferency, and led in such an habit of Inconformity, as the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Reduction of those tender Conscienced men, to long discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Obedience, was at the last interpreted an Innovation.</q>
If <hi>Andrews</hi> had succeeded <hi>Bancroft,</hi> and <hi>Laud</hi> followed <hi>Andrews,</hi> the Church would have been setled to sure on a Foundation, that it could not easily have been shaken; to the preventing of those deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Miseries, which the Remiss Government of that Popular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late did so unfortunately bring both on the Church and State.</p>

His good Friend and Patron Bishop <hi>Neile,</hi> then being of <hi>Rochester,</hi> had procured him a Turn before the King at <hi>Theobalds</hi> on the 17th. of <hi>September</hi> 1609. and by the power and favour of the same man, being then translated unto <hi>Litchfield,</hi> he was sworn one of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Chaplains in Ordinary on the third of <hi>November, Anno</hi> 1611. yet so that he continued his dependencies on his former Lord, to whom he was as dear and necessary as before he was; injoying free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the accomodations of his House, whensoever his occasions

brought him to <hi>London.</hi> Having thus set foot within the Court, he promised himself great hopes of some present preferment; but those hopes deceived him. Nothing is more uncertain than Court Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments: Some have them suddenly at the first, and then continue at a stand without farther Additions, as in the case of Doctor <hi>Young</hi> Dean of <hi>Winchester</hi>: Some attend long, and get nothing, as in the case of Mr. <hi>Arthur Terringham,</hi> and many others; and some are in the same case with the Apostles in St. <hi>Iohn</hi>

But <hi>Neile</hi> was not to be told what he knew before; and therefore answered, That he was very sensible of those many neglects which were put upon him, and saw too clearly that he had been too long under a cloud; but howsoever advised him to stay one year longer, and that if he had no better encouragement within that year, he would consent to his retirement.

It hapned that <hi>Laud</hi> preaching on <hi>Shrove-Sundar. Anno.</hi> 1614. insisted on some points which might indifferently be imputed either to <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism,</hi> (as about that time they began to call it) though in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they were no other than the true and genuine Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England</hi>: And having occasion in that Sermon to touch upon the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and their Proceedings, he used some words to this effect, <hi>viz. That the</hi> Presbyterians <hi>were as bad as the</hi> Papists: Which being so directly contrary to the Judgment and Opinion of this Doctor <hi>Abbot,</hi> and knowing how much <hi>Laud</hi> had been distasted by his Brother when he lived in <hi>Oxon.</hi> conceived he could not better satisfie himself, and oblige his Brother the Archbishop, than by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing him (on the next occasion) both to shame and censure, which he did accordingly: For being <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> for the year, and preaching at St. <hi>Peters</hi> upon <hi>Easter-day</hi> in the afternoon. he pointed at him so directly, that none of the Auditors were so ignorant, as not to know at whom he aimed. <hi>Laud</hi> not being present at the first preaching of the Sermon, was by his friends perswaded to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at St. <hi>Maries</hi> on the <hi>Sunday</hi> after, when it should come to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated (according to the ancient Custom of that University) to whose perswasions giving an unwilling consent, he heard himself sufficiently abused for almost an hour together, and that so palpably and grosly, that he was pointed too as he sate: Some of the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of which Sermon I shall here subjoyn, because howsoever they might bring to him some present and personal disgrace, yet they redowned at the last to the great Good and Benefit of the Vniversity.</p>

plead they are accounted <hi>Papists,</hi> because they speak against the <hi>Puritan,</hi> but because, being indeed <hi>Papists,</hi> they speak nothing against them; If they do at any time speak against the <hi>Papists,</hi> they do but beat a little about the bush, and that but softly too, for fear of waking and disquieting the birds that are in it; they speak nothing but that wherein one <hi>Papist</hi> will speak against another; as against Equivocation, and the Popes Temporal Authority, and the like; and perhaps some of their blasphemous speeches: But in the Points of Free Will, Iustification, Concupiscence being a sin after Baptism, Inherent Righteousness, and certainty of Salvation; The <hi>Papists</hi> beyond the Seas can say they are wholly theirs; and the <hi>Recusants</hi> at home make their brags of them. And in all things they keep themselves so near the brink, that upon any occasion they may step over to them.

&amp; offensionis plenas</hi>; that is to say, for some publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons being less Orthodox, and fuller of offence than they ought to have been. The other, being a man of great wit and able parts, had been Proctor of the University, in the same year in which <hi>Howson</hi> did incur this Censure: And preaching the <hi>Passion</hi> Sermon at <hi>Christ Church, Anno</hi> 1613. insisted on the Article of Christs descending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell, and therein grated upon <hi>Calvins</hi> manifest perverting of the true sense and meaning of it: For which he was so ratled up by the Repetitioner, not without <hi>Abbots</hi> setting on (as it was generally conceived) that if he had not been a man of a very great courage it might have made him ashamed of staying in the University; so dangerous a thing it was to touch at any thing in which <hi>Geneva</hi> was concerned. But the best was, that none of them sunk under the burden of these oppressions, if (like the <hi>Camomile</hi>) they did not rise the higher by it.

                  <p>For he being very sensible of so great an injury, thought it fit to prevent the same by giving an account of It to the Bishop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi>; which he did on the Morrow after the Repetition, being the eighteenth day of <hi>April,</hi> desiring his advice, whether he should sit down by the wrong, or make <hi>Abbot</hi> as sensible of it as he was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. What direction he received in it I am not able to say, but as it seems he was advised to sit down with patience, not to exasperate either of the <hi>Abbots,</hi> and thereby to provoke more enemies against him than he had already. And I conceive that this Advice was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him, because I cannot find that he stirred any further in it; the rather in regard that <hi>Abbot</hi> was nominated not long after to the Bishoprick of <hi>Salisbury</hi> in the place of Dr. <hi>Henry Cotton,</hi> who died on the seventh of <hi>May</hi> next following. And yet this Bishoprick was not carried so clearly for him, notwithstanding his Brothers great power and credit in the Court: but that a very strong opposition was made against him; which being overcome at last, he received Episcopal Consecration on the third of <hi>December,</hi> leaving the choice to Dr. <hi>Iohn Prideaux,</hi> Rector of <hi>Exeter</hi> Colledge, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a vehement assertor of all the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Rigours in the matter of Predestination, and the Points depending thereupon; as appears by his first Lecture, <hi>De Absoluto Decreto,</hi> and the rest which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54785:37"/>
not good to <hi>Laud</hi> to pursue the quarrel, but patiently to attend the year of his expectation; before the expiring whereof the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon him the Deanry of <hi>Glocester,</hi> as before was said. At the bestowing of which Deanry his Majesty told him, that he had been informed that there was scarce ever a Church in <hi>England</hi> so ill governed, and so much out of order as that was, requiring him in the general to reform and set in order what he found amiss. Being thus forewarned, and withall forearmed, he makes hast to <hi>Glocester,</hi> where he found the Church in great decay, many things out of order in it, the Communion Table standing almost in the middest of the Quire, contrary to the posture of it in his Majesties Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and of all the Cathedral Churches which he had seen. Which being observed, he called a <hi>Chapter</hi> of the Prebends, and having acquainted them with his Majesties Instructions, easily obtained their consent to two <hi>Chapter</hi> Acts: The one, for the speedy Repairing of the Church where it was most necessary: The other, for transpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Communion Table to the East end of the Quire, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it all along the Wall, according to the scituation of it in other Cathedral or Mother Churches, which Transposition being made, he recommended to the Prebendaries, the Quire men, Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resters, and the under-Officers of the Church the making of their humble reverence to Almighty God, not only at their first entrance into the Quire, but at their approaches toward the holy Table; according to the laudible custom of the Primitive times, retained still in the sollemnities of the Knights of the Garter at the Act in <hi>Oxon.</hi> in the Chappels of his Majesty, and divers great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Realm. His Majesties instructions, the Contents of the two Chapter Acts, and how he had proceeded on them, I find certified under his hand in two Letters; The one, to his good Friend the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> bearing date <hi>March</hi> 3. 1616. The other, unto the Bishop of <hi>Glocester</hi> (who had shewed himself offended at his proceedings) bearing date on the twenty seventh of <hi>February</hi> then next foregoing.</p>
                  <p>The Bishop of <hi>Glocester</hi> at that time was Dr. <hi>Miles Smith,</hi> once of <hi>Brazen-Nose</hi> Colledge, a great Hebrician, and one that took as much pains as any in the last Translation of the Bible, as a reward for which he received this Bishoprick. But then withall he was a man that spared not to shew himself upon all occasions in favour of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> party; and more particularly in countenancing the Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers within his Diocess against the lawful Minister of the Parish when ever any complaint of their proceedings was made unto him. No sooner had he heard what the new <hi>Dean</hi> had done about the Communion Table but he expressed his dislike of it, and opposed it with all the power he had; But finding that he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile according unto his desires, he is said to have protested un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Dean,</hi> and some of the Prebends, that if the Communion Table were removed, or any such Innovations brought into that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54785:38"/>
Cathedral, he would never come more within those Walls; which Promise or Protestation he is said by some to have made good, and not to have come within that Church to his dying day: Which if he did forbear upon that occasion, he must needs shew himself a man of great pertinacity, and one that feared not to give a publick scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to the Church, and the Court to boot; This transposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made in the declining of the year 1616. his Pallace standing near the walls of that Cathedral, and he not dying till the year 1624. which was eight years after. Seeing how little he prevailed, one <hi>White</hi> his Chaplain takes upon him in a Letter written to the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi> of that <hi>Diocess,</hi> to acquaint him with the strange Reports which were come unto them touching the scituation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Table in the place where the High Altar stood before, and that low obeysance were made to it, assuring him how much the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Papists would rejoyce, in hope that that which they long looked for was now near at hand; In which Letter he also challenged and upbraided the Prebends, and other Preachers of that City, that they did not offer either by word or deed to resist the <hi>Dean</hi> in those proceedings; admiring that no man should have any spark of <hi>Elias</hi> Spirit to speak a word in Gods behalf, that the Preachers should swallow down such things in silence, and that the Prebends should be so faint hearted as to shrink in the first wetting, especially having the Law on their side against it.</p>
                  <p>It was not long before this Letter was made a Libell: Either the Letter it self, or a Copy of it, being cast into the Pulpit at St. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaels</hi> Church, where <hi>Prior</hi> the <hi>Sub-Dean</hi> used to preach; to the end that he and others of the <hi>Prebendaries</hi> might take notice of it. Found by the Parish Clerk, and by him put into the hands of the Curate, by them communicated unto others, who took Copies of it, and in short time divulged over all the City. The City at that time much pestered with the Puritan Faction, which was grown mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinous and strong by reason of the small abode which the Dean and Prebendaries made amongst them, the dull connivance of their Bishop, and the remiss Government of their <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> so that it seemed both safe and easie to some of the Rabble to make an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry in all places that <hi>Popery</hi> was coming in; that the translating of the Communion Table into <hi>an Altar,</hi> with the worship and obeysance which were done to it, were Popish superstitions, and the like. <hi>Iones,</hi> one of the Aldermen of the City, and a Justice of the Peace withall, caused some of the principal dispersers of this Libellous Letter to be brought before him, committed some of them to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and threatned to bind the rest to their good behaviour. But fearing lest his own power might not be sufficient to crush that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which had begun to gather strength by long connivance, he advised that the business might be referred to the <hi>High Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,</hi> as men more able to deal with them. Notice hereof being given to the new <hi>Dean</hi> by some Letters thence, bearing date <hi>Feb.</hi> 21.

he addressed this Letter above mentioned to the Bishop of <hi>Glocester:</hi> In which he desired such Favour and Equity at his hands, as that his Lordship would joyn to reform such Tongues and Pens as knew not how to submit to any Law but their own; that of necessity he was to acquaint his Gracious Majesty, not only with the thing it self, but with the entertainment which it found among Turbulent Spirits; and that he doubted not but that his Majesty would be well pleased to hear how careful his Lordship shewed himself in preserving the Order and Peace of the Church. But fearing that the Bishop, whose Chaplain was the sole cause of the mischief, would not be very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to redress it, he dispatched the other Letter, above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and in that Letter he desired his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship (having first moved that the High Commission would be pleased to take some speedy order in it) to let him have his lawful assistance to the end, that so long as he did nothing but what was established and practised in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he might not be brought into contempt by turbulent Spirits, at his first entrance on that place, and so be disinabled to do that good service which he owed to the Church of Christ; withall propounding to his Lordship, that if it stood with his good liking, his Majesty might be made acquainted with the first success of his endeavors for reforming such things as he found most amiss in that Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>This was the first step toward the suppressing of that Reputation which <hi>Calvin</hi> and his Writings had attained unto in that University; and a good step it might have been, if Dr <hi>Goodwin, Dean</hi> of <hi>Christ Church,</hi> who was then Vice-Chancellor, had not been Father-in-law to <hi>Prideaux,</hi> or rather if <hi>Prideaux</hi> himself had approved the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or that Dr. <hi>Benfield</hi> of <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> the other Professor for Divinity, a grave but sedentary man, had been active in it.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54785:39"/>
not be forgotten in 20. years after: Certain I am, that in the year 1636. it was charged by <hi>H. Burton</hi> of <hi>Fryday-street</hi> for an Innovation, one of the many <hi>Innovations</hi> introduced by <hi>Laud,</hi> and others of the <hi>Prelatical</hi> party, to subvert <hi>Religion.</hi> But leaving them to the folly of their own affrightments, let us look back unto the King, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confident that he had left the University in a ready way for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an <hi>Vnity</hi> in matters of Doctrine, prepared for his Journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Scotland,</hi> with a like confidence of effecting an <hi>Vniformity</hi> in Forms of Worship: A matter of consequence and weight, and therefore to be managed by able Ministers, such as knew how to winde and turn the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of that Kingdom, if matters should proceed to a Disputation. The known Abilities of <hi>Laud</hi> mark'd him out for one; which though it were like to bring a great Charge upon him, yet he preferred the Reputation before the Charge, and chearfully embrac'd the Service. Nor was it more welcom unto him, than grateful to the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> assured thereby not only of a trusty Friend, but of a sociable Companion, for that tedious Journey. His Majesty having filled up the List of his Attendants, on the 14th. day of <hi>March</hi> began his Journey, accompanied by the Queen and Prince as far as <hi>Theobalds,</hi> and from thence went forward with his Train before appointed. By the way he called in at the City of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> where it is not to be doubted but that the Bishop gave him as magnificent an Entertainment as the Place and Country would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford: And from this place it was that he dated his Instructions of the 14th. of <hi>April,</hi> to the Lord <hi>Iohn Digby,</hi> then going Embassador into <hi>Spain,</hi> to Treat upon and Conclude a Marriage between Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> and the <hi>Infanta Maria</hi> the Second Daughter of that King; one of which Articles was to this effect, <hi>That the Espousals being made in</hi> Spain <hi>according to the Order of the Councel of</hi> Trent, <hi>the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage should be solemnized in</hi> England, <hi>where there should be such a Solemnization as by the Laws of this Realm should make the Marriage valid, and take away all scruple touching the Legitimation of the Issue.</hi> Which temperament seems to me to have very much in it of <hi>Laud</hi>'s hand and spirit.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of <hi>May</hi> 1617. his Majesty was come as far as <hi>Barwick,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1617.</note> and from thence visiting the West parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> came at last to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where he soon found that he might have saved himself a great part of his care, and taken such of his Chaplains with him as came next to hand; the <hi>Presbyterian Scots</hi> not being to be gained by Reason, as he had supposed: For he was scarce setled in that City, when the <hi>Presbyters</hi> conceiving that his coming was upon design to work an Uniformity between the Churches of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, set up one <hi>Struthers</hi> to preach against it, who laid so lustily about him in the chief Church of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> that he not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but prayed God to save <hi>Scotland</hi> from the same. <hi>Laud,</hi> and the rest of the Chaplains who had heard the Sermon, acquainted his Majesty
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54785:40"/>
with those passages; but there was no remedy: The <hi>Scots</hi> were <hi>Scots,</hi> and resolved to go their own way whatsoever came of it. For though the Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> had forewarned them, that they should not irritate his Majesty, whom they should finde a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Prince,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hist.

Patrick Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> one of the chiefest amongst them, passing his word for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. But when the King was gone, and the day of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly come, those promises vanished in the smoak; so that the King gained nothing by that chargeable Journey, but the neglect of his Commands, and a contempt of his Authority. His Majesty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took a better course, than to put the point to Argument and Disputation; which was to beat them by the Belly, and to withdraw those Augmentations which he had formerly allowed them out of his Exch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But whatsoever the King lost by the Journey, I am sure the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> got well by it: For <hi>Iames</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> dying during the Kings abode in <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Majesty bestowed upon him that wealthy Bishoprick; one of the wealthiest in Revenues, but Absolutely the greatest in Power and Priviledges. Into this Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick being canonically confirmed on the ninth of <hi>October,</hi> he presently set himself on work to repair the Palaces and Houses belonging to it, which he had found in great decay; but he so adorned and beautifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in a very short space, that they that saw them could not think that they were the same.<note place="margin">

to allow sufficient Quarters for <hi>Buckridge</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> and <hi>Laud</hi> Dean of <hi>Glocester,</hi> which he enjoyed when he was Bishop of St. <hi>Davids</hi> also; some other Quarters were reserved for his old servant Doctor <hi>Linsell,</hi> and others for such Learned men of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance as came from time to time to attend upon him; insomuch as it passed commonly by the name of <hi>Durham Colledge.</hi> A man of such a strange composition, that whether he were of a larger and more publick Soul, or of a more uncourtly Conversation, it were hard to say.</p>
                  <p>But to return again to <hi>Laud</hi>: Finding his Majesty resolved to pass thorow <hi>Lancashire</hi>; and other Counties of the North-west of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in his way to <hi>London,</hi> he obtained leave to go directly unto <hi>Oxon.</hi> and on the second of <hi>August</hi> was inducted into the Rectory of <hi>Ibstock</hi> in the County of <hi>Leicester</hi>; a Rectory belonging to the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of the Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> of whom he had it in exchange for his <hi>Kentish</hi> Benefices.

Nothing else memorable in this year, as in relation to his Story, but some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes which befel the Archbishop, his perpetual enemy; the greatest whereof (though perhaps not took most to heart) was the death of his Brother the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> which produced great sorrow to his Friends, the rather in regard of the manner and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it: For after his advancement to the See of <hi>Sarum,</hi> being then neer sixty years of Age, he married the Widdow of one Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Cheynell</hi> a Physician, who had been one of his Contemporaries in <hi>Baliol</hi> Colledge; the news whereof being presented (with some circumstances to his disadvantage) to his Brother the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he received from him such a sharp and bitter Letter, so full of Reproaches and Revilings, that not being able to bear the burthen of so great an insolency, he presently took thought upon it, and as presently died, leaving this life on the second of <hi>March,</hi> the year almost expiring with him.</p>
                  <p>The Archbishop had been off the hooks ever since the affront (as he conceived) was put upon him in burning his Chaplain Doctor <hi>Mockett</hi>'s Book, entituled, <hi>De Politia Ecclesiae Anglicanae,</hi> which had given no small Reputation to the Church of <hi>England</hi> beyond the Seas; for which severity though many just Reasons were alledged,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54785:41"/>
yet it was generally conceived, that as the Book fared the worse for the Authors sake, so the Author did not speed the better for his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron the Archbishops sake, betwixt whom, and Doctor <hi>Iames Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> there had been some differences, which the rest of the Court Bishops were apt enough to make some use of to his disadvantage.</p>
                  <p>But having thus fallen upon the burning of this Book, I shall speak something of it here, because of some particulars in it which may conduce unto our Story in the times succeeding. This Doctor <hi>Moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi> being Chaplain to Archbishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> and Warden of <hi>All Souls</hi> Colledged in <hi>Oxon.</hi> had publish'd in the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue the Liturgie of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Publick Catechisms, the 39. Articles, the Book of Ordination of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Doctrinal Points extracted out of the Book of Homilies; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi>'s <hi>Apology,</hi> Mr. <hi>Noel</hi>'s Chatechism, and his own Book <hi>De Politia, &amp;c.</hi> A Collection which the good man published in a pious zeal, for gaining Honour to this Church amongst Forrein Nations: But then this Zeal of his was accompanied with so little Knowledge in the Constitution of this Church, or so much biassed toward those of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Plat-form, that it was thought fit not only to call it in, but to expiate the Errors of it in a publick Flame: For first, his Extracts out of the Book of Homilies were conceived to be rather framed according to his own Judgment, which enclin'd him toward the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrines, as his Patron did; than squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to the Rules and Dictates of the Church of <hi>England</hi>: And possible enough it is, that some just offence might be taken at him, for making the Fasting-days appointed in the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be commanded and observed <hi>ob Politicas so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Rationes,</hi> for politick Considerations only, as insinuated <hi>p.</hi> 308. whereas those Fasting-days were appointed in the first <hi>Liturgy</hi> of King <hi>Edward</hi> vj. <hi>Anno</hi> 1549. (with reference only to the Primitive Institution of those several Fasts) when no such <hi>Politick</hi> Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were so much as thought on. But that which I conceive to have been the true cause why the Book was burned, was, that in publishing the 20th. Article, concerning the Authority of the Church, he totally left out the first Clause of it, <hi>viz. Habet Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia Ritus sive Ceremonias, statuendi jus; &amp; in Controverfiis Fidei Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem</hi>: By means whereof, the Article was apparently falsified, the Churches Authority disavowed, and consequently a wide gap opened to dispute her Power in all her Canons and Determinations of what sort soever. I note this here, because of the Relation which it hath to some following passages in the year 1637. when we shall finde <hi>Laud</hi> charged by those of the <hi>Puritan Faction,</hi> for adding this omitted Clause to the rest of that Article.</p>

by the diligence of Archbishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and the severity of Justice <hi>Popham,</hi> had been crush'd at their first starting out; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards not daring to implore the Countenance of Authority, they got footing again in divers places by the cunning of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ignorant confidence of some of their Lecturers, and the misguided zeal of some publick Ministers of Justice: And they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed so far at last, that the Annual Festivals being turned into days of Labour, and the Lords day wholly taken up in Religious Duties, there was no time left for <hi>lawful Recreations</hi> amongst the People: Which being made known unto King <hi>Iames</hi> as he passed thorow <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cashire</hi> the last Summer, he gave some present Order in it, for the ease and comfort of his good Subjects in that County; and that it might not serve only for the present, but the times to come, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished his Royal Declaration to the same effect, bearing date at <hi>Greenwich May</hi> 24. of this present year: In which Declaration there are three things to be observed; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Motives,</hi> the <hi>Liberties,</hi> and the <hi>Restrictions.</hi> First, for the <hi>Motives</hi> which induced that King to this Declaration, they were chiefly four. 1. The general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of all sorts of People, as he passed thorow <hi>Lancashire,</hi> of the Restraint of those innocent and lawful Pastimes on that day, which by the Rigors of some Preachers and Ministers of Justice, had been laid upon them. 2. The hindrance of the Conversion of many <hi>Papists,</hi> who by this means were made to think, that the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion was inconsistent with all harmless and modest <hi>Recreations.</hi> 3. That by debarring them from all man-like Exercises on those days, on which only they were freed from their daily Labours, they were made unactive, unable, and unfit for Warriors, if either him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self or any of his Successors should have such occasion to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them. 4. That men being hindred from these open Pastimes, betook themselves to Tipling-houses, and there abused themselves with Drunkenness, and censured in their Cups his Majesties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings both in Church and State. Next for the <hi>Liberties</hi> which were indulged upon that day, his Majesty declares his Pleasure, That after Divine Service being ended, his good People should not be discouraged or letted from any <hi>lawful Recreations,</hi> such as Dancing either Men or Women, Archery for Men, Leaping, Vaulting, or any other such harmless Recreations, not from having of <hi>May-games, Whitsun-Ales,</hi> and <hi>Morris-dances,</hi> and the setting up of <hi>May-poles,</hi> and other sports therewith used; and that Women shall have leave to carry Rushes to the Church, for the decoring of it, according to their old Custom, with this <hi>Proviso</hi> notwithstanding, That under the general term of <hi>Lawful Recreations,</hi> he intended neither Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baiting nor Bull-baiting, Interludes, nor (at all times in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er sort of People prohibited) Bowling. And last of all, for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions,</hi> they were these that follow: 1. That these Pastimes should be no impediment or let to the publick Duties of that day. 2. That no Recusant should be capable of the benefit of them. 3. Not such
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54785:42"/>
as were not diligently present at the time of all Divine Offices, which the day required. And, 4. That the benefit thereof should redound to none but such as kept themselves in their own Parishes. Such was the substance of his Majesties Declaration about <hi>Lawful Sports,</hi> which raised great clamour at the present, but greater when revived in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> (at what time we shall finde <hi>Laud</hi> charged for the Re-publishing of it) so much the greater, by how much the more the <hi>Sabbatarian Doctrines</hi> had prevailed amongst us,</p>
                  <p>This being done for the discountenancing of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Faction here at home, we must next see what was done abroad on the same account; that which was done abroad in relation to it, being of great concernment to this Church, and therefore necessary to be known in reference to the person of whom I write.

To speed this business, and strike the Iron whilst it was hot, his Majesty made that chargeable Journey into <hi>Scotland,</hi> which before we spake of, with an intent to press them personally to the receiving of some few of the <hi>English</hi> Ceremonies, which had been offered to the consideration of the late Assembly, the better to advance his hopes of introducing by degrees the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Church of <hi>England</hi>: Which Ceremonies being reduced to five Articles, and propounded to them at his being there, found such success, and put the King upon such Councels as have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly declared.

                  <p>But on the other side, the condemning of the five <hi>Arminian</hi> Articles (as they commonly called them) at the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> was altogether as much unpleasing as the others had been grateful to him; for well he saw the great dangers which might thence ensue to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whose Doctrines were openly confronted, and her Discipline se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly undermined, by the Decisions and Determinations of that <hi>Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical</hi> Assembly: In which regard, it will not be unnecessary to make a brief Relation of those stirs and differences which hapned in the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> Churches, from the time that Doctor <hi>Iacob van Harmine</hi> was made one of the Divinity Professors in the University of <hi>Leyden,</hi> Concerning which we are first to know, That at the Alteration of Religion in those Provinces, the <hi>French</hi> (who were most active in it) brought with them <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Platform, both for Doctrine and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline (as commonly the one makes way to bring in the other) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto which the <hi>Belgick Confession</hi> was drawn up in the year 1567.

profess'd himself an <hi>Anti-Calvinian; Clemens Martini,</hi> who took his Principles from <hi>Hardinbergius,</hi> one of the first Reformers of the Church of <hi>Embden; Gellius Sueranus</hi> in <hi>West-Friesland,</hi> who looked upon those of the other Perswasion as Innovators in that Church; <hi>Holmanus</hi> the Divinity Reader in <hi>Leyden; Cornelius Menardi,</hi> a man of good esteem amongst them; and generally all the Ministers suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively in the Province of <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> some of which had maintained these Doctrines before the birth of <hi>Iacob van Harmine</hi> (better known in these later times by the name of <hi>Arminius</hi>) and all of them before such time as any publick notice had been taken of him; by which it seems, that these Doctrines were of a long standing, and had took deep rooting in these Churches, though they had not gained such a large and general spreading over them as they after did.</p>
                  <p>For in the year 1603. the Learned <hi>Iunius,</hi> one of the Professors for Divinity in the University of <hi>Leyden,</hi> being then deceased, the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators</hi> or Overseers of that University made choice of this <hi>Van Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> the Pastor (as they phrase it) of the Church of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> to succeed in his place: But the Inhabitants of that Town, amongst whom he had served in the Ministry for the space of 15. years and mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

During his sitting in that Chair, he drew unto him a great part of that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, who by the Piety of the man, his powerful Arguments, his extreme diligence in the place, and the clear light of Reason, which appeared in all his Discourses, were so wedded unto his Opinions, that no time nor trouble could divorce them: For <hi>Arminius</hi> dying in the year 1609. as before was said, the heats betwixt his Scholars, and those of the contrary perswasion, were rather increased than abated; the more increased, for want of such a prudent <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator</hi> as had before saved and preserved these Churches from a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Rupture.</p>

                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:54785:43"/>The Breach between them growing wider, each side thought fit to seek the Countenance of the State, and they did accordingly; For in the year 1610. the Followers of <hi>Arminius</hi> address their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance</hi> (containing the Antiquity of their Doctrines, and the substance of them) to the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> which was encountred presently by a <hi>Contra-Remonstrance,</hi> exhibited by those of <hi>Calvins</hi> Party. From hence the names of <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> and <hi>Contra-Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants,</hi> so frequent in their Books and Writings; till the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants</hi> were condemned in the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> and either forced to yield the cause or quit their Country; each Party in the mean time had the opportunity to disperse their Doctrines, in which the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants</hi> gained exceedingly upon their Adversaries. For the whole Controversie being reduced to these five Points, <hi>viz.</hi> the Method of <hi>Predestination,</hi> the <hi>Efficacie</hi> of Christs Death, the operations of <hi>Grace,</hi> both before and after mans Conversion, and <hi>perseverance</hi> in the same; the Parties were admitted to a publick Conference at the <hi>Hague</hi> in the year 1611. in which the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> were conceived to have had much the better of the day. But these Tongue-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates did produce a further mischief than was suspected at the first; For the <hi>Calvinians</hi> hoping to regain by Power what they lost by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, put themselves under the Protection of <hi>Maurice van Nassaw, Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> Commander General of the Forces of the United Provinces, both by Sea and Land. The <hi>Remonstrants</hi> on the other side applied themselves unto <hi>Iohn Olden Barnevelt,</hi> a principal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor of State, and of great Authority in his Country: Who fearing the Greatness of the Prince, and having (or thinking that he had) some cause to doubt that he aimed at an absolute Soverainty over those Estates, did chearfully entertain the offer, in hope to form such a Party by them, as, with the help of some other good Patriots, might make a sufficient Counter-ballance against that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign. But <hi>Barnevelts</hi> projects being discovered, he was first seized on by the Prince, together with <hi>Grotius, Liedenburgius,</hi> and others of his chief Adherents; and that being done, he shewed himself with his Forces before such Towns and Cities as had declared in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of them; Reducing them under his Command, changing their Magistrates, and putting new Garrisons into them. Next followed the Arraignment and death of <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> contrary to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Laws both of his native Country, and the common Union; whose death occasioned a general dejection (as well it might) amongst those of the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> Party; and their dejection anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Calvinians</hi> to refer their differences to a National Council, which thereupon was intimated to be held at <hi>Dort,</hi> one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple Towns of <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Council being thus resolved on, their next care was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite to their assistance some Divines out of all the Churches of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins</hi> Platform, and none else; which did sufficiently declare, that they intended to be both Parties and Judges, as in fine it proved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For unto this Convention assembled the most <hi>Rigid Calvinists,</hi> not only of the United Provinces, but also of all the Churches of <hi>High Germany,</hi> and amongst the <hi>Switz,</hi> and from the City of <hi>Geneva</hi> whom it most concerned. From <hi>France</hi> came none, because the King, upon good Reason of State, had commanded the contrary; and the <hi>Scots</hi> much complained that they were not suffered by King <hi>Iames</hi> to send their Commissioners thither with the rest of the Churches: For though King <hi>Iames</hi> had nominated <hi>Balcanquel</hi> to that imployment in the name of the <hi>Kirk,</hi> yet that could give them no contentment. From <hi>England,</hi> the King sent Dr. <hi>George Carleton</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Landaff,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ios. Hall</hi> Dean of <hi>Worcester,</hi> Dr. <hi>Iohn Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> Master of <hi>Queens Colledge</hi> and Lady <hi>Margarets Professor</hi> in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sam. Ward</hi> Master of <hi>Sydney</hi> Colledge in the same University. And this he did, that by the Countenance of his power, and by the Presence of his Divines, he might support the Party of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and suppress his Adversaries. On the third of <hi>November</hi> they began the Synod: But things were carried there with such inequality, that such of the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> as were like to be elected, by their several Classes, were cited, and commanded to appear as <hi>Criminals</hi> only, and being come, could not be suffered to proceed to a Disputation, unless they would subscribe to such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as they conceived to be destructive to their Cause, and their Conscience too: Which being refused, they were expelled the House by <hi>Bogerman</hi> (who sate President there) in a most fierce and bitter Oration, condemned without answering for themselves; and finally, for not subscribing to their own condemnation, compelled to forsake their native Country, with their Wives and Children, and to beg their bread even in desolate places. What influence those quarrells had amongst our selves, and what effects that <hi>Synod</hi> did produce in the Church of <hi>England</hi> we shall see hereafter, when the same Points come to be agitated and debated on this side of the Seas.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty, having thus made himself the Master of his Designs, both at home and abroad, and being recovered from a dangerous sickness which had fallen upon him at <hi>New-Market,</hi> in the year 1619. resolved on such a work of Magnificent Piety, as might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his name and memory of succeeding Ages: To which end upon <hi>Midlent</hi> Sunday, <hi>Anno</hi> 1620. accompanied by the Prince, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the <hi>Marquiss</hi> of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Bishops, Lords, and most of the principal Gentlemen about the Court, he intended to visit St. <hi>Pauls.</hi> From <hi>Temple-bar</hi> he was conducted in most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomn manner by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>London</hi>; and at his entrance into the Church, received under a <hi>Canopy</hi> by the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> attired in rich <hi>Copes,</hi> and other Ecclesiastical Habits; Being by them brought into the Quire, he heard with very great Reverence and Devotion the Divine Service of the day most solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed with <hi>Organs, Cornets,</hi> and <hi>Sagbuts,</hi> accompanied and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54785:44"/>
intermingled with such excellent voices that seemed rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant than chant. The Divine Service being done, he went unto a place prepared, where he heard the Sermon at the <hi>Cross,</hi> preached by the eloquent and religious Prelate, Dr. <hi>Iohn King,</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>London.</hi> The <hi>Sermon</hi> being ended, the <hi>Collation</hi> began; His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty attended with all the Lords, and the rest of his Train, being entertained by the said Lord Bishop at a sumptuous Banquet, with no less honour to himself than content to his Majesty. But there was more intended by this Visit than Pomp and Ostentation only. For his Majesty having taken a view of the Ruinous Estate in which he beheld that goodly Fabrick, issued not long after a <hi>Commission</hi> for repair thereof; and somewhat was done in it both by Bishop <hi>King</hi> and Bishop <hi>Mountain</hi>: But the carrying one of this work was reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to another man; For a breach following not long after between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and wars soon following on that breach, a stop was made to all proceedings in that work till the year 1631.

The Emperour exasperated with this Usurpation (as by him reputed) gave up his Country for a prey, assigning the Electoral Dignity with the Upper <hi>Palatinate</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the Lower to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had possest themselves of divers good Towns and pieces in it.</p>
                  <p>For the recovery whereof, and the Preservation of the rest, in which his Daughter and her Children were so much concerned; it pleased his Majesty to call a Parliament, to begin on the thirtieth day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> accompanied with a Convocation (as the custom is) on the morrow after. The business of their Conveening being signified unto them by the King, the Parliament at their first sitting, which ended <hi>March</hi> 27. bestowed upon his Majesty two Subsidies,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54785:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but they gave no more; which rather served to stay his stomach than allay his hunger. They had some turns to serve upon him before they would part with any more money, if they did it then. But the Clergy dealt more freely with him in their Convocation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had no other ends in it than the expressing of their duty and good affections. In testimony whereof they gave him three en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Subsidies of four shillings in the pound at their first sitting; and would not have been wanting to his Majesty in a further addition, in the second or third, if his Majesty had required it of them. Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with which supplies, and the hopes of greater, he sent some Regiments of old <hi>English</hi> Souldiers for the defence and preservation of the <hi>Lower Palatinate,</hi> under the Command of that Noble Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, Sir <hi>Horatio Vere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Commons bestowed upon him the said two <hi>Subsidies,</hi> he took them only as a bit to stay his stomach, as before was said, giving himself some hopes that at the next Session they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him with a better, and more costly dinner; but then they meant that he should pay the reckoning for it. For at their reassem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling on the seventeenth of <hi>April,</hi> instead of granting him the supplies he looked for, they fell to pick quarrels with his Servants, and one of his chief Ministers of State, not only questioning Sir <hi>Giles Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pesson,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Michael,</hi> but even the Lord <hi>Chancellor Bacon</hi> also. These men (supposing them to have been as criminal as their enemies made them) were notwithstanding such as acted under his Commissions, and therefore not to have been punished by his own Authority only. The giving of them over to the Power of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament not only weakened his own Prerogative, but put the House of Commons upon such a Pin, that they would let no Parliament pass (for the times to come) without some such Sacrifice. And so foll <hi>Bacon,</hi> Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> Lord <hi>Verulan,</hi> and Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of St. <hi>Albans</hi>; a man of good and bad qualities, equally compounded, one of a most strong brain, and a Chimical head; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing his endeavors to the perfecting of the Works of Nature, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improving Nature to the best advantages of life, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefit of mankind. Pity it was he was not entertained with some liberal Salary, abstracted from all affairs both of Court and Judicature, and furnished with sufficiency both of means, and helps for the going on in his design, which had it been, he might have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us such a body of Natural Philosophy, and made it so subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the publick good, that neither <hi>Aristotle</hi> nor <hi>Theophrastus</hi> amongst the Ancients, nor <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> or the rest of our later Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists would have been considerable. In these Agitations held the Parliament till the fourth of <hi>Iune,</hi> without doing any thing in order to his Majesties Service, who thereupon adjourned them till the fourteenth of <hi>November</hi> following, before which time we find <hi>Laud</hi> mounted one step higher, and ready to take place amongst the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor did he shew less patience in his so long and chargeable attendance at the Court, for which he had so small regard, that he was rather looked upon as the Bishop of <hi>Durhams</hi> Servant than the Kings. But notwithstanding these cross winds he was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ride it out, neither to shift his sails, nor to tack about, but still to keep his way, and to stem the current till he had gained the Port he aimed at. His Majesty had been made acquainted by long experience with his great abilities, his constancy, courage, and dexterity, for managing affairs of moment. And thereupon entring into speech with him, in the beginning of <hi>Iune</hi> he was pleased to take notice of the long and unrewarded service which he had done him, telling him, that he looked on the <hi>Deanry</hi> of <hi>Glocester</hi> but as a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54785:46"/>
Shell without a Kernel. This gave him the first hopes of his grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fortunes. On Sunday the nineteenth of that Month he preached before the King at <hi>Wansteed,</hi> that being the first of those Sermons, which are now in Print. And on St. <hi>Peters</hi> day next following, there was a general expectation about the Court that he should have been made <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> in the place of <hi>Williams</hi>; who having been sworn Privy-Counsellor on the tenth of that Month, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated to the See of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> was on the tenth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> honoured with the Custody of the great Seal of <hi>England</hi> upon the Deprivation of the Lord Chancellor St. <hi>Albans,</hi> which before we spake of: but <hi>Williams</hi> so prevailed at Court, that when he was made Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> he retained this Deanry in <hi>Commendam,</hi> together with such other Preferments as he held at that time; That is to say, A <hi>Prebend</hi> and Residentiary place in the Cathedral Church at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and the Rectory of <hi>Walgrave</hi> in <hi>Northampton-shire,</hi> so that he was a perfect Diocess within himself, as being <hi>Bishop, Dean, Prebend, Residentiary,</hi> and <hi>Parson</hi>; and all these at once. But though <hi>Laud</hi> could not get the Deanry, yet he lost nothing by the example; which he made use of in retaining not only his <hi>Prebends</hi> place in the same Church of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> and his Benefices in the Country (that being an ordinary indulgence to such as were preferred to the smaller Bishopsricks) but also the Presidentship of his Colledge in <hi>Oxon,</hi> which he valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more than all the Rest. For that his own expectation might not be made as frustrate, as was that of the Court, his Majesty nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated him the same day to the See of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> in former times the Metropolitan City of the <hi>Welsh</hi> or <hi>Brittish.</hi> But though he was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated then, he could not receive the Episcopal Character till five Months after; the stay was long, but the necessity unavoydable, by reason of a deplorable misfortune which had befallen Archbishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> and was briefly this:</p>
                  <p>The Archbishop had long held a dear and entire Friendship with <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Zouch,</hi> a person of an eminent and known Nobility; On whom he pleased to bestow a visit in his house at <hi>Bramshall,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to see a Deer hunted, that he might take the fresh air, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive his Spirits; a Cross-bow was put into his hand to shoot one of the Deer: but his hand most unhappily swerving, or the Keeper as unfortunately coming in his way, it so pleased God (the Disposer of Humane Affairs) that he missed the Beast, and shot the Man. On which sad accident, being utterly uncapable of consolation, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired himself to <hi>Guilford,</hi> the place of his birth; there to expect the Issue of his wofull Fortunes in an Hospital of his own Foundation. The news of this wretched misadventure (as ill news flies far) came the same day to the Lord Keeper <hi>Williams</hi>; and he as hastily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches this Advertisement of it to the Marquess of <hi>Buckingham.</hi>

                           <p>AN unfortunate occasion of my Lords Grace, his killing of a man casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally (as it is here constantly reported) is the cause of my seconding of my yesterdays Letter unto your Lordship. His Grace upon this Accident is by the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> to forfeit all his Estate unto his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and by the Canon Law (which is in force with us) irregular <hi>ipso facto,</hi> and so suspended from all Ecclesiastical Function, until he be again restored by his Superiour, which (I take it) is the Kings Majesty in this Rank and Order of Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction. If you send for Doctor <hi>Lamb,</hi> he will acquaint your Lordship with the distinct Penalties in this kind. I wish withal my heart his Majesty would be as merciful as ever he was in all his life; but yet I held it my duty to let his Majesty know by your Lordship, that his Majesty is fallen upon a matter of great Advice and Deliberation. To add affliction unto the afflicted (as no doubt he is in mind) is against the Kings Nature: To leave <hi>virum san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinum,</hi> or a man of blood, Primate and Patriarch of all his Churches, is a thing that sounds very harsh in the old Councils and Canons of the Church. The <hi>Papists</hi> will not spare to descant upon one and the other. I leave the knot to his Majesties deep Wisdom to advise and resolve upon. A rheum fallen into mine eye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Which Letter bearing date <hi>Iuly</hi> 27. 1621. points us directly to the time of this woful Accident.</p>
                  <p>Being thus pre-judged and pre-condemned, the miserable man must needs have had a hard bout of it, if his cause had been referred to an hearing in <hi>Chancery</hi>: But King <hi>Iames</hi> was as compassionate as just, and as regardful of the Church as he was compassionate to the man. Advising therefore with his Council, and some chief Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men about him, though more with his own gracious disposition, he after issued a Commission to the Lord Keeper <hi>Williams,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>London, Winchester,</hi> St. <hi>Davids,</hi> and <hi>Exon,</hi> as also unto <hi>Hubbert</hi> and <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> two of the Justices of the Courts at <hi>Westminster-hall, Martin</hi> and <hi>Steward,</hi> Doctors of the Civil Laws, men of great Eminence and Abilities in their several Studies, to make Inquiry into the Fact: And having made Inquiry into the Fact, they were to give their Resolution unto His Majesty, whether the Archbishop had been made <hi>irregular</hi> by that sad accident, as it was commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. In the managing of which great Cause, there was much variety of Opinions amongst the Delegates; some making him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to <hi>Irregularity,</hi> and others as much labouring to acquit him of it: Amongst these last were Doctor <hi>Andrews</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Martin</hi> then Dean of the <hi>Arches,</hi> and not long after Judge of the <hi>Prerogative Court,</hi> to whose Authority and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the rest of the Commissioners did in time conform. <hi>Martin</hi> for his part had received his Offices and Preferments from him, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54785:47"/>
therefore in an honest Gratitude thought himself obliged to bend the Law (as much as possibly he could) to his best Advantage: But <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> had no such impulsives, there being between them some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust, which might have rather prevailed with him to have been his Enemy: First therefore he was willing not to stand too rigidly upon the strictness of the <hi>Canons,</hi> for fear lest others of the Bishops, and himself amongst them, either through ignorance or incogitancy, might commit some acts, which without a fair and mild constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, might render them as uncanonical as that poor man was: And then he saw, that if the Archbishop at that time had been pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>irregular,</hi> and the See made void, <hi>Williams</hi> being then Lord Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and in great favour with his Majesty and the Marquis too, would have step'd into it; of whom he knew too much, to venture that great charge and trust of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to his Care and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; the dangerous Consequences whereof he was able to foretell, without the Spirit of Prophecy. Nor was this conjecture of his without very good grounds, <hi>Williams</hi> declaring in his said Letter to the Marquis, That his Majesty had promised him upon the relinquishing of the Seal, one of the best places in this Church. And what place could be more agreable to his affection than the Chair of <hi>Canterbury</hi>? Nor was this unfortunate Prelate less befriended in this desperate plunge by Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> a man of most profound Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Laws of this Land, who being ask'd the Question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Bishop might lawfully hunt in his own or in any other Park? (in which point lay the greatest pinch of the present difficulty) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned this Answer thereunto; <hi>viz. That by the Law a Bishop at his death was to leave his Pack of Dogs</hi> (by the <hi>French</hi> called <hi>Marte de Chiens,</hi> in some old Records) <hi>to be disposed of by the King at his Will and Pleasure.</hi> And if the King was to have the Dogs when the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop died, there is no question to be made, but that the Bishop might make use of them when he was alive.</p>
                  <p>By reason of this intercurrence, the new Elected Bishops could not receive the Episcopal Character till <hi>November</hi> following; on the eleventh day of which Month, the Lord Keeper <hi>Williams</hi> was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> in the Chappel of King <hi>Henry,</hi> by vertue of a Commission under the Broad Seal, directed to certain other Bishops, according to the Statute of King <hi>Henry</hi> viij. And on the <hi>Sunday</hi> following, by vertue of a like Commission directed to the Bishops of <hi>London, Worcester, Chichester, Ely, Landaff,</hi> and <hi>Oxon.</hi> Doctor <hi>Laud</hi> Lord <hi>Elect</hi> of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> Doctor <hi>Davenant</hi> Lord <hi>Elect</hi> of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Cary</hi> Lord <hi>Elect</hi> of <hi>Exceter,</hi> received Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal Consecration in the Chappel of <hi>London-House.</hi> The next day after he took his place amongst the Bishops in the House of <hi>Peers,</hi> the Parliament having been re-assembled some few days before: But there was little for them to do as the case then stood; The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were so far from gratifying the King with fresh Supplies, who before had gratified them in the destruction of such Ministers as were
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54785:47"/>
neer unto him, that they entertained him with Petitions and Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances touching the danger, threatned to our Religion, by the growth of <hi>Popery</hi>; in which they were so far transported beyond their bounds, as to propose unto the King, <hi>the taking of the Sword into his Hands against the</hi> Spaniard, <hi>and the Marrying of his dear Son the Prince to a Lady of the Reformed Religion:</hi> Of this the King had speedy notice; and in a Letter sent to Sir <hi>Thomas Richardson,</hi> then Speaker of the House of Commons, he lets them know how sensible he was of their incroachments, how bold they had made themselves with the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; forbidding them to deal hereafter in Affairs of State, or meddle with the Marriage of his Son the Prince; concluding, That if any such Petition or Remonstrance should be brought unto him, he would neither vouchsafe the Answering or the Reading of it. The Commons startled with this Letter, and thinking to have made a benefit of the Kings Necessities, cry out against it as a violation of their Ancient Priviledges; and on the nineteenth day of <hi>December</hi> then next ensuing, drew up the following <hi>Protestation,</hi> and caused it to be entred on Record in their Journal Books, <hi>viz.</hi>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54785:48"/>
Prerogative invaded, his Paternal Right disputed, a popular State growing up in the midst of a Monarchy, and at the present a great Faction formed against him, which if not speedily suppressed might prove unresistable. Way he found none to extricate himself out of these troubles, but to proceed vigorously in the Treaty for the Match with <hi>Spain,</hi> which he conceived to be the only expedient to compose all Differences, and recover the Patrimony of his Children. For should he break off with that King, and declare for a present War against him, as had been desired, he was to cast himself en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on the Love of his People, of whose Affections and Designs their present Actions gave just cause to be distrustful. He therefore first gives Order on the nineteenth of <hi>December</hi> (being the very day on which the Protestation was Voted at <hi>Westminster</hi>) to Adjourn the Parliament to the 8th. of <hi>February,</hi> under pretence that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers might retire into the Country, for keeping Hospitality, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining their Neighbours in the <hi>Christmas</hi> Holydays, according to the laudable Custom of the <hi>English Nation</hi>: But having thus dismissed them to their several Countries, without noise or trouble, it was not his intent or purpose that they should come together again at the time appointed; according to which Resolution he Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves the Parliament, and by his Proclamation bearing date the ninth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> discharges the Members of both Houses from any further attendance.</p>
                  <p>The Dissolving of this Parliament, and the Transactions in the same, administred much variety of Discourse in all parts of the Kingdom. It was observed by some, That his Majesty had broken one of the strongest Ligaments of the Regal Power, by delivering up his Servants and Ministers into the hands of his People in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was a thing not used by any of his Predecessors; That neither <hi>Wolsey</hi>'s exorbitant Power, or <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s contempt of the Nobility, under <hi>Henry</hi> viii. or <hi>Leicesters</hi> Tyranny and Oppressions under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were ever suffered to be canvased or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in Parliament; That the King got nothing by that unhappy condescension, but the laying himself open to all disadvantages which a Prince abandoning his Ministers, or abandoned by them, might have just reason to expect; That when Princes begin to fall so much beneath themselves, as to manage Pen-Combate with their Subjects, they put themselves as it were upon equal ground, and stand on the same Level with their Vassals, and by the loss of their Authority, get nothing but the Reputation of an able Writer. And then the Reason of these his yieldings being brought in Question, they were by some imputed to a natural timidity or want of Courage, which rendred him unable to hold out long, when he encountred those who would put him to it: Others ascribed it to his wants, and his wants unto his prodigality, which made his Exchequer always empty; and Money must be had, whatever it cost him. But those who thought they came most neer unto the mark, discoursed of him as a

man that loved not business, and loved no business less than that of Parliaments; That it was usual with him, when he called a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and had given them their Errand, as he thought, to retire to <hi>Theobalds, Hampton-Court,</hi> or <hi>Windsor,</hi> and sometimes further off, to <hi>Royston,</hi> or <hi>New-Market,</hi> as his pleasure carried him; That by this means the Commons, not having opportunity of Access to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, were forced upon a plausible necessity of making their Addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to him by Messages, Remonstrances, and Petitions; That those Remonstrances and Petitions did beget their Answers, and their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers did beget Replies which ended commonly in Exasperations on either side.</p>
                  <p>But nothing was so much admired at, as the encreasing of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the House of Commons, as well in nature as in number. And thereupon it was observed, that the Commons had mistook themselves in the very ground on which they built their Protestation; That the known Priviledges of the Commons were only liberty of speech in Debate and Conference; Freedom from all Arrests for themselves and their Servants, and opportunity of access to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Person, as their occasions did require; That even those Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges could not be called the undoubted Birth-Right and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> because they were no otherwise exercised and enjoyed than from one Parliament to another, by the grace and goodness of their Kings; That were it otherwise, it must needs be a great impertinency in their <hi>Speaker</hi> (at the first opening of every Parliament) to put himself upon his knees, and humbly to beseech his Majesty, in behalf of the House of Commons, to indulge them the continuance of those Priviledges which were of right their own before; That they had been as much mistaken in making the House of Commons (by involving both Houses in the name of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) to be of equall Power and Priviledge with the House of <hi>Peers,</hi> the contrary whereof being so well known; That the <hi>Peers</hi> and People being summoned to Parliament by several Writs, the <hi>Peers</hi> were called only <hi>ad consulendum,</hi> to counsell and advise the King, in matters of most concernment to the Church and State; And that the People were called only <hi>ad consentiendum &amp; faciendum,</hi> to give consent, and yield obedience to such things as were ordained in the Great Council of the <hi>Peers</hi>; That even the <hi>Peers</hi> themselves had no general warrant to meddle in all Affairs of State, but in such only as his Majesty commend and propound to them; And therefore that these words in the Writ, <hi>Super arduis regni negotiis,</hi> are not left at large, but limited and restrained by the word <hi>quibusdam,</hi> to such particulars, and such only, in which the King required their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.</p>
                  <p>But nothing seemed so new or strange, as that no Member of the said House <hi>should be impeached, imprisoned, and molested, other than by Censure of the House it self, for or concerning any speaking, reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or declaring of any matter or matters touching the Parliament, or
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54785:49"/>
Parliament business.</hi> A Priviledge not heard of in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, when in the 35. of her Reign She imprisoned no less than five of the Members at a clap, not only without their leave, but against their liking; And held them in so strict a durance, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons did not think it safe to move her Majesty to restore them to their former liberty. And therefore that they were to shew under what rust and rubbish of Antiquity this Priviledge had so long been hidden, and how it came to be found out at last, when no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy heard of it, or looked after it. The like discoursed also of the following Priviledge, which had been long buried in the same grave, and never came till now to a resurrection, <hi>viz.</hi> That the King is to take no private information of any complaint, concerning matters said or done in that House, till it be shewn unto him by the House it self; of which it was affirmed, that it was as contrary to the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Practise of former times as the other was: That when the Queen had laid an Imposition upon Currans, and that this Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been complained of by some Merchants to the House of Commons, she had present notice given her of it by some of her Servants in that House, that shewing her dislike thereof to Sir <hi>Robert Cicill,</hi> principal <hi>Secretary</hi> of State, he signified the same unto the House, telling them it was a <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> a point not fit for them to touch at; and that if they desisted not from entertaining that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, he must acquaint her Majesty with it, as in duty bound. Nor was there any better ground for that other branch, touching their Liberty and Freedom in breaking of all matters which came under their Cognizance in such method and order as to them seemed fittest; but that they did intend to lay it as a foundation for preferring their own business before the Kings in all times to come.</p>
                  <p>I had not dwelt so long upon these Discourses, nor on the former passages between his Majesty and the House of Commons, as being Exotical to my business: but that they were the chief occurrences of this first Parliament, of which our new Bishop was a Member. And though the sitting was but short, not above a Month; yet it afforded him a liberal prospect into the Humours and Affections, the Counsels and Designs of the House of Commons, of which he was not to be taught how to make such use, as should prove most to the advantage of the Church and State. But that which chiefly did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern him to take notice of, was the interposing and embracements of that House in the cause of Religion; which if it were so much in danger by the extraordinary encrease of <hi>Popery,</hi> as they gave it out, it must be much to the Reproach both of himself and the rest of the Bishops, that none of them had neither perspicuity enough to see it, or Zeal enough to give warning of it. And therefore he must needs conceive, that Religion was made use of only for a blind or Curtain to screen some dark design from the publick view, which had not yet attained to so ripe a confidence as to shew it self abroad in the open
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54785:49"/>
light. The <hi>Mystery of iniquity</hi> had long been working in this Church, not so much in the <hi>Popish</hi> as the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction. Who seeing they had no more prevailed against it by their open batteries than the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emperours had done on the Primitive Church by their persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, resolved upon more secret (and consequently more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous) practises to attain their ends. In order whereunto they had perpetually alarm'd this King (from his first coming to the Crown) with continual dangers from the Papists; for which the Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-treason gave them too much ground. Nor would they suffer any Session of Parliament pass from that time forward, in which the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous practises of <hi>Priests, Iesuits,</hi> &amp;c. did not sound in his ears. And this they did, not so much because they saw any such visible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of <hi>Popery,</hi> as was by them pretended from time to time: but that they thought it the best way to carry on their other projects, which they were in hand with. For well they knew, that when the thoughts both of King and People were totally taken up with the apprehension of the dangers which were feared from the <hi>Papists,</hi> the <hi>Puritan</hi> Party in the mean time might gather strength without being noted or observed. But because these interposings of the Commons in the cause of Religion, became to be more eagerly pursued in some following Parliaments, we shall refer the further consideration of them to another time.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament being ended,<note place="margin">1622.</note> we must follow our new Bishop to his Diocess, whom we will wait upon to St. <hi>Davids</hi> (a poor City God wot) scituate on the Promontory in <hi>Pembroke-shire,</hi> by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients called <hi>Ortopitae,</hi> in a safe place, and far enough from the <hi>Saxons,</hi> whom the <hi>Welsh</hi> most feared: but incommodious enough for all the rest of the Clergy to repair unto. Nor did it prove so safe for the Bishop, and other Inhabitants of it, as had been presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in respect of sundry other Nations who have often spoyled and defaced it. For standing near the Sea it had been frequently vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited and spoyled by the <hi>Danes, Norwegians,</hi> and other <hi>Pyrates</hi>; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that the Bishops were inforced to remove their dwelling to <hi>Caermarthen,</hi> a fair Market Town, and beautified with a goodly Collegiate Church, not far from which, in a Village called <hi>Aberguilly,</hi> the Bishop hath his ordinary place of Residence. This brought the City of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> small enough before, to the condition of a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, there being nothing almost remaining of it but the Church, the ruines of the Bishops Palace, and some Houses appertaining to the Canons of it. The Church, as now it stands, (if any of it be now left standing) was the work of Bishop <hi>Peter</hi> the forty eighth Bishop of this Diocess, and by him dedicated by the name of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> and St. <hi>David;</hi> though now St. <hi>Andrew</hi> be left out, and St <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> bears the name, (as before it did) in reference to St. <hi>David,</hi> who first removed the Archiepiscopal See from <hi>Caer-leon</hi> thither. The place at that time by the <hi>Welsh</hi> called <hi>Menew,</hi> whence the Latines borrow their <hi>Menevenses,</hi> by which name these Bishops are
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54785:50"/>
entituled. From this removal of the <hi>See,</hi> which hapned in 519. the Bishops hereof were for some time the Metropolitans, and for a long time the supreme Ordinaries of the <hi>Welsh</hi> or <hi>Brittish.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Archbishop <hi>Samson,</hi> the twenty sixth from St. <hi>David,</hi> in the year 910. or thereabouts, had carried the <hi>Archiepiscopal Pall</hi> (and therewithall the Archiepiscopal dignity) to <hi>Dole</hi> in <hi>Bretagne,</hi> by reason of an extreme Pestilence, then raging amongst the <hi>Welsh</hi>; yet his Successors, though they lost the name, reserved the power of an Archbishop. Nor did the residue of the <hi>Welsh</hi> Bishops receive their Consecration from any other hand than his till the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> I. At what time <hi>Bernard,</hi> the forty sixth Bishop of this See, was forced to submit himself to the Church of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But our Bishops Journey into <hi>Wales</hi> was not so much to visit S. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids,</hi> (in which Church he had been before installed by Proxie) as to bestow a visitation upon his Diocess, and therein to take order for the rectifying of such things as he found amiss. A Diocess contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Counties of <hi>Pembroke, Cardigan, Caermarthen, Radnor,</hi> and <hi>Brecknock,</hi> with some small parts of <hi>Monmouth, Hereford, Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>mery,</hi> and <hi>Glamorgan</hi> Shires. For managing whereof the Bishop hath under him four Archdeacons, that is to say, of <hi>Cardigan, Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marthen, Brecknock,</hi> and St. <hi>Davids</hi>; distributing amongst them all the Parishes which belong to this Diocess, amounting to no more (in so great a quantity of ground) than 308. of which 120. are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for Impropriations. But then we are to understand this number, of Parochial Churches, not taking into the Account such subordinate Chappels as had been built in several Parishes for the case of the People, which might very much increase the reckoning. And yet he added one more to them of his own foundation; and such a one as for the elegancy of the building, and richness of the Furniture, exceeded all the rest together. Chappels he found none at his Episcopal house of <hi>Aberguilly,</hi> and one he was resolved to bestow upon it, proportionably to such a Family as was fit for a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of St. <hi>Davids</hi> to have about him; which being finished, he provided it of Rich Furniture, and Costly Utensils, and whatsoever else was necessary or convenient for the Service of God; the very Plate designed for the celebrating of the holy Supper amounting to one hundred fifty five pounds eighteen shillings four pence. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that if <hi>Felix</hi> the <hi>Proconsul</hi> had been still alive, he might have cried out now, as he did in the time of <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostate,</hi> viz. <note n="(g)" place="margin">

                  <p>I have laid all these things together, from his Consecration in <hi>November</hi> 1621. till his return toward <hi>London</hi> on the fifteenth of <hi>August</hi> 1622. though the building and consecrating of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was the work of some following years, and that there intervee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a business of another nature betwixt the end of the Parliament and the beginning of his Journey. The Treaty for a Match with <hi>Spain</hi> was conceived to be very forwards, and the Parliament had ended in disgust for declaring against it, which much encreased the Audaciousness of the <hi>Papists,</hi> and the discontents of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction. And though the Projects of these last were not yet ripe enough for a present discovery, yet so it hapned, that one <hi>Knight,</hi> a young Divine of <hi>Broadgates</hi> in <hi>Oxon.</hi> (now better known by the name of <hi>Pembroke Colledge</hi>) broke out a little before his time into such expressions as plain enough declared the purpose of all the rest. For preaching at St. <hi>Peters</hi> on <hi>Palm Sunday</hi> in the Afternoon (being the fourteenth day of <hi>April</hi>) on those words of the Apostle, <hi>viz. Let every soul be subject,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. he broacht this dangerous Doctrine: viz. <hi>That the Inferiour Magistrate had a lawful power to order and correct the King if he did amiss.</hi> For illustration of which Doctrine he used that speech of <hi>Trajans</hi> unto the Captain of his Guard: <hi>Accipe hunc gladium, quem pro me si bene imperavero di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringes; sin minus contra me</hi>; That is to say, Receive this Sword, which I would have thee use for my defence if I govern well; but if I rule the Empire ill, to be turned against me. For this being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in question by Dr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> one of the Canons of <hi>Christ Church,</hi> being then Vice-Chancellor, he was commanded to deliver a Copy of his Sermon, which he did accordingly; and Letters presently were dispatcht to the Bishop of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> as the only <hi>Oxford</hi> Bishop then about the King, to make his Majesty acquainted with it. It was his Majesties pleasure, that both the Preacher and the Sermon should be sent to the Court. Where being come, he was very strictly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined about the Doctrine he had Preached, and how he came to fall upon it: He laid the fault of all upon some late Divines of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Churches, by whom he had been so misguided; Especially on <hi>Pareus</hi> a Divine of <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> who in his Commentary on the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the <hi>Romans</hi> had positively delivered, all which he had vented in his Sermon, even to that very saying of the Emperour <hi>Trajan.</hi> On this acknowledgment, it pleased the King of his special goodness to remit the errour of the Preacher, considering him as a young man, and easily seduced by so grave an Author; but then withall
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54785:51"/>
he gave such order in the Point, That the said Book of <hi>Pareus</hi> should be publickly burnt, not only in both the Universities, but also after the end of the Sermon at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross <hi>London,</hi> on some <hi>Sunday</hi> following; which Sentence was accordingly executed at <hi>Oxon.</hi> in St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church-yard, on the sixth of <hi>Iune,</hi> in a frequent Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Vice-chancellor, Doctors, Procters, Heads of Houses, Regents, Non-Regents, and many others, whom curiosity or desire of satisfaction did allure unto it. The like done at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Cross also on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 23d. of <hi>Iune</hi> next following; <hi>Mountain</hi> then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>London,</hi> Preaching there upon that occasion. The like was done at <hi>Cambridge</hi> also, but the time I know not.</p>
                  <p>But yet the business staid not here: The University of <hi>Oxon.</hi> thought themselves concerned to acquit the whole Body from that Censure, which the Error of one Member might have drawn upon it; and thereupon it was thought fit, that the most seditious Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims and Positions, which in that point had been delivered by <hi>Pareus,</hi> should be extracted out of that Book; and being so extracted, should be presented to the Vice-chancellor, and by him referred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Judgment of the University: Which being done, a Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was assembled on the 25th. day of <hi>Iune,</hi> in which the said Maxims and Positions were by an unanimous consent condemned as false, seditious, impious, and destructive of all Civil Government. Nor did the University think they had done enough in looking back on Times past only, if they provided not also for the preventing of the like mischiefs for the time to come; and thereupon it was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the said University; First, That according to the <hi>Canon</hi> of Holy Scripture it was not lawful for the Subject to resist his Sovereign by force of Arms, or to make War against him, either <hi>Offensive</hi> or <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,</hi> whether it were for the cause of Religion, or upon any other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatsoever. Secondly, That all Doctors, Masters of Arts, Batchelors of <hi>Law,</hi> and Batchelors of <hi>Physick,</hi> living within the verge of the University, should subscribe to those Censures and Decrees: and, Thirdly, That whosoever did hereafter take any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in any Faculty whatsoever, should first acknowledge the truth and justice of those Censures, by his Subscription to the same; and should withal take his Corporal Oath (the form of which Oath was then prescribed) That he did not only from his heart condemn the said Doctrines of <hi>Pareus</hi>; but that he would neither preach, teach, or maintain the same, or any of them for the future. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>or the better avoiding of the like inconveniences which <hi>Knight</hi> had run himself upon, by that preposterous course of Study which was then generally used in that University, Order was given that his Majesties Instructions of the 18th of <hi>Iune</hi> 1616. should be published in all the Chappels of Colledges, and some publick place in every Hall, that all young Students in Divinity might take notice of them: And this produced by little and little such an alteration, that the name of <hi>Calvin</hi> (which before had carried all before it) began to lessen by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54785:51"/>
his Reasons more looked upon than his Affirmations, and the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England</hi> more closely followed than they had been formerly.</p>
                  <p>Nor did his Majesty so much neglect his own safety, or the peace and happiness of his People, as not to take such order in it as might prevent the like false, factious, and seditious Preachings for the time to come. He found by this example, that divers young Students, by reading of late Writers and ungrounded Divines, might and did broach unprofitable, unsound, seditious and dangerous Doctrines, to the scandal of this Church, and disquieting of the State and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Government; That the falling off of some to <hi>Popery,</hi> and of others to <hi>Anabaptistry,</hi> or to some other kind of separation from the Church, could not so rationally be imputed to any other thing than to the lightness, affectedness, and unprofitableness of that kind of Preaching, which had been of late years too much taken up in Court, University, City, and Country; That too many Preachers were noted to be soaring up in points of Divinity too deep for the capacities of the people; That others ignorantly meddled in Civil matters, as well in the private meetings of several Parishes and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, as in the Publick of the Kingdom, for the venting of their own distaste, or smoothing up of those idle fancies, which in this blessed time of so long a Peace, doth boil in the brains of an unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed People; That many of their Sermons were full of rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent railings, not only against the Doctrines, but even against the persons of <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Puritans</hi>: And finally, that the People never being instructed in the Catechism, and fundamental Grounds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; for all these aiery novellisms which they received from such Preachers, were but like new Table-books, ready to be filled up, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Manuals and Catechisms of the <hi>Popish</hi> Priests, or the Papers and Pamphlets of <hi>Anabaptists, Brownists,</hi> and other <hi>Puritans.</hi> His Majesty thereupon taking the Premises into his Princely Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which had been represented to him by sundry grave and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Prelates of this Church, thought it expedient to cause some certain Limitations and Cautions, concerning Preachers and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be carefully digested and drawn up in Writing: Which done (so done as <hi>Laud</hi> appears to have a hand in the doing of it) and being very well approved by the King, he caused them to be directed to the Archbishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> by them to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the Bishops of their several Provinces, and by those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to be put in execution in their several Diocesses. Which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections bearing date of the fourth of <hi>August,</hi> 1622. being the 20th. year of his Majesties Reign, I have thought convenient to subjoin, and are these that follow, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>No sooner were these <hi>Instructions</hi> published, but strange it was to hear the several descants and discourses which were made upon them; How much they were misreported amongst the People, and misinterpreted in themselves; those very men who saw no just reason to condemn the Action being howsoever sure to misconstrue the end. For though they were so discreetly ordered, that no good and godly man could otherwise than acknowledge that they tended very much to Edification; Yet such Interpretations were put upon them, as neither could consist with his Majesties meaning, nor the true sense of the Expressions therein used. By some it was given out, that those Instructions did tend to the restraint of Preaching, at the lest as to some necessary and material points; by others, that they did abate the number of Sermons, by which the People were to be instructed in the Christian Faith; by all the Preachers of that Party, that they did but open a gap for Ignorance and Superstition to break in by degrees upon the People. Which coming to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Ears, it brought him under the necessity of making an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for himself, and his actions in it. And to this end having sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up the reasons which induced him to it, he required the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to communicate them to his Brother of <hi>York</hi>; by both to be imparted to their several Suffragans, the inferiour Clergy, and to all others whosoever, whom it might concern: which notwithstanding, it lay so heavy on the stomach of <hi>H. Burton</hi> (at that time a Waiter in the Court, and afterwards beneficed in <hi>Friday</hi>-street) that it would not down with him for many years. Inso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>much that in his seditious Sermon, Entituled, <hi>For God and King, Anno</hi> 1636. he chargeth it for an <hi>Innovation</hi> in Religion, that the Bishops then about King <hi>Iames,</hi> (of which <hi>Laud</hi> was one) procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54785:53"/>
an order from him to inhibit yong Ministers from preaching those Doctrines (those saving Doctrines as he calls them) of Election and Predestination, and that none but Bishops and Deans should handle those Points; which he is confident to have been done by them for no other reason, <hi>But thereby the more easily to make way for the accomplishing of their plot,</hi> for the introducing of <hi>Popery,</hi> so long in hammering. So impossible was it for that King, (and as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for his Son and Successor) assisted by the gravest and most moderate Counsellors, to fix on any thing conducible to the peace and happiness of the Church, but what must be traduced, and made odious in the sight of the People by the reports and artifices of those troublesome Spirits.</p>
                  <p>Now as his Majesty and the Church were exercised on the one side by the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, so were they no less troubled and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted by the <hi>Popish</hi> Party on the other. The Priests and Jesuites, upon the breaking up of the Parliament, and the proceedings of the Treaty, grew to such an height of confidence that they openly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to practice on some persons of Honour for seducing them and their dependants to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> Amongst whom there was none more aimed at than the Countess of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> whom if they could gain unto their Party, they doubted not but by her means to win the <hi>Marquiss,</hi> and by his power to obtain a tollerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the least of their Superstition. The Lady beginning to stagger in her resolutions, and <hi>Fisher</hi> the Jesuite (who had undertaken the task) continually pressing her by fresh arguments to declare her self, it came at last to the Kings knowledge, who was not wanting to discourse with her for her satisfaction. At that time Dr. <hi>Francis White,</hi> Rector of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Cornhill,</hi> was reader of the Divinity Lecture in the Church of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by which he had gained an high esteem amongst his Auditors, not only for his honest Zeal against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, in those (as they were then thought) Pendulous times: but for a notable dexterity in the managing of all points of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. No man thought fitter than this Doctor to encounter <hi>Fisher.</hi> And to that end, in the beginning of this year, he was desired by the Marquiss to hold a Conference with the Jesuite, at which his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being present, might hear what answers would be given to such Objections as had been made against this Church, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion here by Law established. One Conference not being enough to conclude the business, another followed not long after, to which the King himself did vouchsafe his presence; so great was his desire to free this Honourable Lady from the <hi>Fishers</hi> net. But in that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Conference (consisting altogether of particular points) there had been nothing said touching an infallible, visible Church, which was the chief and only point in which the Party doubting required satisfaction. And that she might have satisfaction in that matter also, it pleased his Majesty to add a third Conference to the former on the twenty fourth of <hi>May</hi> next following, not to be managed by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54785:53"/>
the same parties, but by our Bishop on the one side, and the said <hi>Fisher</hi> on the other; the Lord Keeper <hi>Williams</hi> (who put in a word or two sometimes) and divers other persons of Honour being also present.</p>
                  <p>How well he sped in that encounter, the Printed Conference, which came out about two years after, and the justification of it published in the year 1637. do most clearly evidence, or shall be shewn here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in due time and place. Certain I am, that he gained so much by that days work on the <hi>Marquiss</hi> of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> that from that time forwards he was taken into his especiall favour; For he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self telleth us in his <hi>Breviate</hi> on <hi>Whitsunday, Iune</hi> the eighth, That the <hi>Marquiss was pleased to enter into a nearer respect to him, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars whereof were not for paper</hi>; That on the fifteenth of that Month he had the honour to be made the <hi>Marquiss</hi>'s <hi>Confessor</hi> (which was to give him in effect) the Key of his heart; that on the Morrow after, being <hi>Trinity</hi> Sunday, the <hi>Marquiss</hi> having thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared himself, received the Sacrament at <hi>Greenwich.</hi> Which if he had not forborn for a long time before, this <hi>Memorandum</hi> in the <hi>Breviate</hi> must have been impertinent; and finally, that on the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> the Marquiss and he were at some private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation, in the inner Chamber at <hi>York</hi>-House, on which he prays God to bestow his blessing. Nor was the King less pleased with his performance at that time, than the Marquiss was. On the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port whereof, he gave him order to digest the substance of it into Form and Method, to make it ready for his hearing in convenient time; and was content to give him access no less than thrice in the <hi>Christmas</hi> holydays, that he might hearken to it with the more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. That King had never the command of so strong a patience as to hold out against a second or third reading, if he had not found some high contentment in the first. In which Conjuncture, it was no hard matter for him to obtain the renewing and enlarging of his <hi>Commendam</hi> by the addition of the Parsonage of <hi>Creek</hi> in <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonshire,</hi> into which he was instituted and inducted, in the end of <hi>Ianuary.</hi>

                  <p>We are now drawing unto a new and strange adventure, greater than which was never undertaken and performed by a Prince of <hi>England.</hi> The Treaty for the Match with <hi>Spain,</hi> beginning in the year 1617. was afterwards more vigorously prosecuted by King <hi>Iames,</hi> upon a hope of bringing back the <hi>Palatinate</hi> with it; But while he fed himself with hopes, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Bavarians,</hi> had devoured the Country, leaving but three Towns (<hi>Heidelberge, Frankendale,</hi> and <hi>Manheime</hi>) to keep possession for the <hi>Prince Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> in the name of the rest. Which the King finding at the last, and seeing that one delay begat another, without promising any end to his Expectations; it was by him resolved, without the privity and consent of his Council, that the Prince himself should go in Person into <hi>Spain,</hi> that he might either speed the business, or break
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54785:54"/>
of the Treaty: Nor wanted the Prince strong impulsives to induce him to it. He was now past the two and twentieth year of his Age, and was so bent upon the Match, that he began to grow impatient with his Fathers Ministers for not ripening it unto an issue; For it is evident by <hi>Digbys</hi> Letter unto <hi>Calvert</hi>

                     <hi>for being called on early and late to hasten the dispatch of all.</hi> Some Messages and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches had been brought by <hi>Porter</hi> out of <hi>Spain</hi> about three daies before, which winged his feet, and added Spurs to the design. The Journey being thus agreed on, was in the very nature of it, to be made a secret; and therefore not communicable to the Lords of the Council for fear of staying him at home, or rendring him obnoxious to the danger of an interception as he past through <hi>France</hi>; which mischief if it had befaln him, he must either have submitted unto such conditions, or suffered under such restraints as might seem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable in themselves, but absolutely destructive of his present purpose; which may the rather be believed by reason of the like proceedings of that King with the present Prince Elector <hi>Palatine</hi>; who posting disguised through <hi>France,</hi> in hope to get the Command of Duke <hi>Bernards</hi> Army, was stayed in the middle of his Journey by that Kings command, and kept so long under Restraint that he lost the opportunity of e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fecting that which he desired.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be thought but that much danger did appear in the undertaking, but Love, which facilitates impossibilities, overcomes all dangers. On the eighteenth day of <hi>February,</hi> accompanied by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Endimion Porter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Francis Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington,</hi> he took Ship at <hi>Dover,</hi> and landed safe at <hi>Boloigne</hi> a Port of <hi>Picardy.</hi> Advanced on his way as far as <hi>Paris,</hi> his Curiosity carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the Court, to see a Masque, at which he had a view of that incomparable Princess, whom he after married. But he was like to have paid dear for this curiosity; For no sooner had he left the City, but the <hi>French</hi> King upon Advertisement of his being there, dispatcht away many of his Servants in pursuance of him, commanding them not only to stay his Journey, but to bring him back unto the Court. But he rides fast who rides upon the wings of Love and Fear, so that the Prince had past <hi>Bayonne</hi> (the last Town of <hi>France</hi>) without being overtaken by them; and posting speedily to <hi>Madrid</hi> he entred the Lord Ambassadors Lodging without being known to any but his Confidents only. That Danger being thus escaped, he cast himself upon another; For having put himself into the Power of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> it was at the curtesie of that King whither he should ever return or not; it being a Maxime among Princes, that if any one of them without leave sets foot on the ground of another, he makes himself <hi>ipso facto</hi> to become his Prisoner.

                     <hi>Richard</hi> the First of <hi>England</hi> passing in disguise through some part of the dominions of the Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria</hi> was by him took prisoner, and put unto so high a Ransome, that the Arch-Duke is said to have bought the Earldom of <hi>Styria,</hi> or <hi>Styrmark,</hi> with some part of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and to have walled <hi>Vienna</hi> with the rest. Nor wanted the <hi>Spaniards</hi> some Examples of a latter date, which might have justified his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention there, had they been so minded, and those too borrowed from our selves. <hi>Philip</hi> the first of <hi>Spain</hi> (one of the Predecessors of the King then Reigning) being cast by tempest on the Coast of <hi>England,</hi> was here detained by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh till he had delivered up the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who had put himself under his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. In like manner <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> being forced by her Rebellious Subjects to flee into this Realm, was presently seized on as a Prisoner, and so continued till her lamentable and calamitous death. And what could more agree with the rules of Justice, and the old known practise of <hi>Retaliation,</hi> then that the <hi>English</hi> should be punished by the rigour of their own severities.</p>
                  <p>Such were the Dangers which the Princes person was exposed to by this unparalell'd adventure, not otherwise to be commended (in most mens opinions) but by the happy success of his Return. And yet there were some fears of a greater danger than any could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall his Person by Sea or Land; that is to say, the danger of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrought on to alter his Religion, and to make shipwrack of his Faith; and this by some uncharitable persons is made the ground of the design, to the indelible reproach of those who were supposed to have had a hand in the contrivement of the Plot. Amongst those the <hi>Marquiss</hi> stands accused by the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> as appears by the first Article of the Charge which was exhibited against him in the Parliament of the year 1626. And our new Bishop stands reproached for another of them by the Author of the book entituled, <hi>Hidden works of darkness,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="(m)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Hidden works,</hi> p. 34.</note> But then it cannot be denied, but that his Majesty and the Prince must be the Principals in this Fact, this <hi>Hidden work of darkness,</hi> as that Author calls it; <hi>Buckingham</hi> and St. <hi>Davids</hi> being only accessaries, and subservient instruments. But who can think they durst have undertaken so soul a business, which could not be washt off but by their bloud, had not the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and the Prince consented? Now for the King, there is not any thing more certain than the great care he took that no danger should accrue to the Religion here by Law established by the Match with <hi>Spain.</hi> And this appears so clearly by the Instructions which he gave to <hi>Digby</hi> at the first opening of this Treaty, as if it had been written with a beam of the Sun:
<q>The matter of Religion (saith he) is to us of most principal consideration; for nothing can be to us dearer than the honour and safety of the Religion we profess: And therefore seeing that this Marriage and Alliance (if it shall take place) is to be with a Lady of a different Religion from us; it becometh us to be tender, as on the one part, to give
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54785:55"/>
them all satisfaction convenient; so on the other, to admit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may blemish our Conscience, or detract from the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion here established.</q>
And to this point he stood to the very last, not giving way to any alteration in this, or tolleration of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; though he was pleased to grant some personal graces to the Recusants of this Kingdom, and to abate somewhat of the Rigour of those <hi>Capitall</hi> Laws which had been formerly enacted against Priests and Jesuites.</p>
                  <p>Next for the Prince, he had been brought up, for some years then last past, <hi>at the feet</hi> of this most learned and wise <hi>Gamaliel</hi>; by whom he was so fortified in the true Protestant Religion, established by the Laws of this Realm, that he feared not the encounter of the strongest Adversary; and of this the King was grown so confident, that when <hi>Maw</hi> and <hi>Wren,</hi> the Princes Chaplains, were to receive his Majesties Commands at their going to <hi>Spain,</hi> there to attend upon their Master, he advised them not to put themselves upon any unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Disputations, but to be only on the defensive part, if they should be challenged. And when it was answered, That there could be no reason to engage in such Disputations where no Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator could be had; The King replied, That <hi>Charles</hi> should mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate between them and the opposite party. At which when one of them seemed to smile upon the other, the King proceeded, and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, that <hi>Charles</hi> should manage a point in Controversie with the best studied Divine of them all; and that he had trained up <hi>George</hi> so far as to hold the Conclusion, though he had not yet made him able to prove the Premises. By which it seems that his Majesty conceived no such fear on the Princes part, as that he could be practised or disputed out of his Religion; and that he had no such fear of <hi>Buckingham</hi> neither, but that he would be able to stand his ground, notwithstanding any Arguments which were brought to move him. And he that is so far confirmed as to stand his ground, will never yield himself though he may be vanquished. It was not then to be believed, that me so principled and instructed, as not to be forced out of their Religion, should take such pains to be perverted, or seduced upon worldly policies, as well against their Science, as against their Conscience. Had they gone thither on that Errand, what could have hindred them from putting the design in execution; having in <hi>Spain</hi> sit opportunity to effect it, at home the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to confirm and Countenance it, and the whole power of his Catholick Majesty (which was offered more than once or twice) to justifie and defend the misrule against all the world. That they brought back the same Religion which they carried with them, is a strong Argument to any man of Sense and Reason that they went not into <hi>Spain</hi> of purpose to betray it there.</p>
                  <p>Let us next look upon the proofs which are offered to us; for <hi>Laud</hi> being privy to this journey, whereof his being of Council to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His Majesty in some of his printed Books had maintained that the <hi>Pope</hi> was <hi>Antichrist</hi>; and now he feared that this might be alledged against him in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to hinder the <hi>Popes</hi> Dispensation, and obstruct the Marriage: For the removal of which bar, he commands the Prince to signifie (if occasion were) to all whom it might concern, <hi>That his Majesty had writ nothing in that Point</hi> concludingly,<note place="margin">

Nor can those following Letters, which he received from <hi>Buckingham</hi> when he was in <hi>Spain,</hi> convince him of being privy to that Journey, when it was in project and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; there being many others also, who both received and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched Letters frequently from that very same person, so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Council as to that particular, that they were not of the Court at all: So ordinary is the fate of such sorry Arguments, to conclude nothing at all, or that which is nothing to the purpose.</p>
                  <p>But what need more be said to confute this Calumny on which I have so long insisted, than the great Care which was immediately taken by the King and his Bishops, to maintain the Reputation of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Court of <hi>Spain</hi>? No sooner had his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty notice that the Prince was come in safety to the Court of that King, but order presently was taken for Officers of all Qualities, and Servants of all sorts to be sent unto him, that so he might appear in Publick with the greater lustre. Nor was it the least part of his Royal Care, to accommodate him with two such Chaplains as should be able to defend the Doctrine of this Church against all Opponents. And that there might appear a face of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the outward Forms of Worship also, his Majesty was pleased by the Advice of the Bishops then about him (of which <hi>Laud</hi> was one) to give the said Chaplains, <hi>Maw</hi> and <hi>Wren,</hi> these Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons following, dated at <hi>Newmarket, March</hi> 10.</p>

And with this Prayer (so plainly destructive of the purpose for which it was published) I shut up the Transactions of this present year.</p>
                  <p>We will begin the next with the dismission of the Archbishop of <hi>Spalato,</hi> a man defamed by the <hi>Italians</hi> at his coming hither, and as much reproached by the <hi>English</hi> at his going hence: His name was <hi>Marcus Antonius de Dominis,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Spalato</hi> in Fact, and Primate of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> in Title: Such anciently and of right those Archbishops were, till the Bishop of <hi>Venice</hi> being made a Patriarch by Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Fourth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1450. assumed that Title to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, together with a Superintendency over all the Churches of that Country, as subordinate to him. He had been long conversant with the Fathers and Ancient Councils; By this Light he discerned the Darkness of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the blind Title which the Popes had for their Supremacy. Inclining to the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he began to fear that his own Country would prove too hot for him at the last; and therefore after he had sate in the See of <hi>Spalato</hi> about fourteen years, he quitted his Preferments there, and betook himself for Sanctuary to the Church of <hi>England, Anno</hi> 1616. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely honoured at his first coming by all sorts of people; enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in both Universities with solemn Speeches; presented, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented, feasted, by the great Lords about the Court, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and some principal Persons about the City: Happy was he that could be honoured with his Company, and satisfied with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his comely presence, though they understood not his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses. Commended by King <hi>Iames</hi> at first for a constant Sojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Guest to Archbishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> in whose Chappel at <hi>Lambeth</hi> he assisted at the Consecration of some <hi>English</hi> Bishops. Made after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the King the Master of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Dean of <hi>Windsor,</hi>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:54785:57"/>
and by himself made Rector of <hi>West-Illesby</hi> in the County of <hi>Berks</hi>: A Revenue not so great as to bring him under the suspicion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hither out of Covetousness, for the sake of filthy Lucre; nor so contemptible, but that he might have lived plentifully and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly on it. During his stay here, he published his learned and elaborate Book entituled, <hi>De Republica Ecclesiastica,</hi> never yet answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Papists,</hi> and perhaps unanswerable. He had given great trouble to the Pope by his defection from that Church, and no small countenance to the Doctrine of the Protestant Churches by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over unto ours. The foundring of so great a Pillar, seemed to prognosticate, that the Fabrick of that Church was not like to stand. And yet he gave greater blows to them by his Pen, than by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his person; the wound so given, being conceived to be incurable.</p>
                  <p>In these respects, those of that Church bestirred themselves to disgrace his person, devising many other causes, by which he might be moved or forced to forsake those parts, wherein he durst no longer tarry: but finding little credit given to their libellous Pamphlets, they began to work upon him by more secret practises, insinuating, That he had neither that Respect nor those Advancements which might encourage him to stay; That the new Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth was his special Friend; That he might chuse his own Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and make his own Conditions, if he would return. And on the other side they cunningly wrought him out of credit with King <hi>Iames,</hi> by the Arts of <hi>Gundamore,</hi> Embassadour at that time from the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; and lessened his esteem amongst the Clergy, by some other Artifices: So that the poor man, being in a manner lost on both sides, was forced to a necessity of swallowing that accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed bait, by which he was hooked over to his own destruction. For having sollicited King <hi>Iames</hi> by several Letters (the last of them bearing date on the third of <hi>February</hi>) to licence his departure home, he was by the King disdainfully turned over to the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> or rather to a special Commission directed to Archbishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> the Lord Keeper <hi>Lincoln,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>London, Durham,</hi> and <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> with certain of the Lords of the Privy Council. These Lords assembling at <hi>Lambeth</hi> on the 30th. of <hi>March,</hi> and having first heard all his Excuses and Defences, commanded him to depart the Realm within twenty days, or otherwise to expect such punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as by the Laws of the Land might be laid upon him, for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Intelligence by Letters, Messages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi> To this Sentence he sorrowfully submitted, protesting openly, That he would never speak reproachfully of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Articles whereof he acknowledged to be sound and profitable, and none of them to be <hi>Heretical,</hi> as appears by a Book entituled, <hi>SPALATO</hi>'s <hi>Shiftings in Religion,</hi> published (as it was conceived) by <hi>Laud</hi>'s especial Friend, the Lord Bishop of <hi>Durham.</hi> How well, or rather how ill he performed this promise, and what became of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54785:57"/>
him after his return to <hi>Rome</hi> is not now my business. The man is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished out of <hi>England,</hi> and my History leads me next into <hi>Spain,</hi> not <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> had a great stock at that time to be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in <hi>Spain,</hi> and many of the <hi>Romish</hi> Factors were desirous to be trading in it. No sooner was the Princes Train of Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen come to the City of <hi>Madrid.</hi> but the King of <hi>Spain</hi> assigned a day for his Reception. A Reception so Magnificent, so full of State, and Royal Pomp, that it redounded infinitely to the honour of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Court, and the satisfaction of the Prince. Never was King of <hi>Spain</hi> on the day of his inauguration received into that City with a more general concourse of all sorts of people, and greater signs of Joy and Gallantry; then the Prince was conducted through it to the Palace Royal. In which his Quarters being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed him, there wanted no allurements on their parts to win him to a fair esteem of their Religion, and to put some high value also on their Court and Nation. Nor was the Prince wanting for his part in all fit compliances, by which he might both gain on them, and preserve himself; for by his Courtly Garb he won so much on the affections of the Lady <hi>Infanta,</hi> and by his Grace and circumspect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour got so much ground upon that King and his Council, that the Match went forward in good earnest. A dispensation for the Marriage was procured from <hi>Gregory</hi> the fifteenth then sitting in the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Articles of the Marriage with all the circumstances thereof were agreed upon, and solemnly sworn to by both Kings. Nothing remained to bring the whole business to a joyfull issue but the Consummation. But before that could be obtained, the Prince must try his fortunes in an harder Conflict than any he had learnt in the Schools of Love.</p>
                  <p>The change of his Religion was much hoped for by the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> at his first coming thither. To perfect which he was plied from time to time with many perswasive Arguments by many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of great Honour about that King. And many of the most learned Priests and Jesuites made their Addresses to him, with such Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Orations, with such insinuating Artifices, and subtle Practises, as if they had a purpose rather to conquer him by kindness, than by disputation. Nor stop they there, but dedicated many Books unto him, to gain him fairly to their Party; invited him to behold their solemn Processions to captivate his outward senses; and carried him to the most Religious places, famous for their magnificent Fabricks, and pretended Miracles. In which conjuncture of designs, it is not to be thought but that the Pope bestirred himself in gaining to his Church a Prince of such parts and greatness. For first he writes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bishop of <hi>Conchen, Inquisitor</hi> general of <hi>Spain,</hi> not to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the opportunity which God had put into his hands. The next day, being the twentieth of <hi>April,</hi> he addressed his lines unto the Prince, extolling the piety of his Predecessors, their Zeal unto the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54785:58"/>
Catholick Church, and to the head thereof the Pope, inviting him by all the blandishments of Art, to put himself upon the following of their brave examples. Never had Prince a harder game to play than Prince <hi>Charles</hi> had now: He found himself under the Power of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and knew that the whole business did depend on the Popes dispensation, with whom if he complied not in some handsome way, his expectation might be frustrate, and all the fruits of that long Treaty would be suddenly blasted. He therefore writes unto the Pope in such general terms as seemed to give his Holiness some assurances of him: but being reduced unto particulars, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied nothing else but some civill complements; mixt with some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of his endeavours to make up the breaches in the Church, and restore Christendom to an happy and desirable peace. Which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding was after reckoned amongst his crimes, by such as rather would not, then did not know the necessity which lay upon him, of keeping at that time a plausible correspondence with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick party.</p>
                  <p>But these Temptations and Allurements, these Artifices and Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, prevailed so little with the Prince, that he still kept his stand, and was found impregnable; carrying himself with such a prudent Moderation in these Encounters, that he came off alwaies without Envy, but not without Glory. And that it might appear on what grounds he stood, it was thought fit to let them see that he professed no other Religion than what was agreeable to the Rules of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not much abhorrent from the Forms then used in the Church <hi>Rome.</hi> And to this end, by the prudent care of the Lord Keeper <hi>Williams,</hi> the <hi>English Liturgie</hi> was translated into Spanish; so many Copies of the book then Printed being sent into <hi>Spain,</hi> as gave great satisfaction both to the Court and Clergy. The work performed by a converted <hi>Dominican</hi>

He knew no Marriage could be made without the <hi>Popes</hi> Dispensation, and that the <hi>Popes</hi> Dispensation could not be obtained without indulging many graces to his Catholick Subjects. To smooth his way therefore to the point desired, he addresseth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Letters to the <hi>Pope</hi> and Cardinals, in which he gives him the title of most holy Father; and imploys <hi>Gage,</hi> as his Agent in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to attend the business.

                     </gap> Archbishop <hi>Abbot.</hi> In this Letter his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Majesty is told,
<q>That by granting any such Toleration he should set up the most damnable and Heretical Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi>; That it would be both hateful to God, grievous to his good Subjects and contradictory to his former Writings, in which he had declared their Doctrines to be Superstitious, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, and detestable; That no such toleration could be granted but by Parliament only, unless it were his purpose to shew his people that he would throw down the Laws at his pleasure; That by granting such a Toleration, there must needs follow a discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the true Profession of the Gospel, and what could fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thereupon, but Gods heavy wrath and indignation both on himself and all the Kingdom; That the Prince was not only the Son of his Flesh, but the Son of his People also, and therefore leaves him to consider what an errour he had run into, by sending him into <hi>Spain</hi> without the privity of his Council, and consent of his Subjects; And finally, That though the Princes return might be safe and prosperous, yet they that drew him into that dangerous and desperate Action would not scape unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the substance of the Letter, whosoever was the Writer of it. For <hi>Abbot</hi> could not be so ill a Statesman (having been long a Privy Councellour) as not to know, that he who sitteth at the Helm must stear his course according unto wind and weather; And that there was a very great difference betwixt such personal indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, as the King had granted in that case to his Popish Subjects, and any such Publick Exercise of their Superstitions, as the word
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54785:59"/>
                     <hi>Toleration</hi> doth import; and howsoever, that it was a known Maxime in the Arts of Government, that necessity over-rules the Law, and that Princes many times must act for the publick good, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing of some personal and particular rights which the Subjects claim unto themselves. Nor could he be so ignorant of the Kings affections as to believe, that the King did really intend any such tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, though possibly he might be content, on good reason of State, that the people should be generally perswaded of it: For well he knew that the King loved his Soveraignty too well to quit any part thereof to the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and consequently to part with that Supremacy in Ecclesiastical matters (as needs he must have done by a Toleration) which he esteemed the fairest Flower in the Royal Garland. In which respect, King <hi>Iames</hi> might seem to be made up of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi>; as impatient of enduring an equal, as of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a Superiour in his own Dominions. Or had he been a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter stranger at the Court than can be imagined, yet could he not be ignorant, that it was the Kings chief interest to preserve Religion in the same state in which he found it; and could not fear but that he would sufficiently provide for the safety of it. Upon which Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, it may be rationally inferred, that <hi>Abbot</hi> was only the <hi>reputed</hi> Author of this Bastard Letter, and not the natural Parent of it.</p>
                  <p>Nor was the Toleration more feared by the English Protestants, than hoped for by the Papists here, and presumed by the <hi>Pope</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. In confidence whereof, he nominated certain Bishops to all the Episcopal Sees of <hi>England</hi> to exercise all manner of Jurisdiction in their several and respective Diocesses, as his false and titular Bishops did in the Church of <hi>Ireland.</hi> The intelligence whereof being given to the Jesuites here in <hi>England,</hi> who feared nothing more than such a thing, one of them, who formerly had free access to the Lord Keeper <hi>Williams,</hi> acquaints him with this mighty secret; assuring him, that he did it for no other reason, but because he knew what a great exasperation it would give the King, and consequently how much it would incense him against the Catholicks. Away with this Intelligence goes the Lord Keeper to the King, who took fire thereat as well as he, and though it was somewhat late at night, commanded to go to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassadour, and to require him to send unto the King his Master to take some course that those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings might be stopt in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; or otherwise that the Treaty of the Match should advance no further. The Lord Keeper finds the Embassadour ready to send away his Pacquet, who upon hearing of the news commanded his Currier to stay till he had represented the whole business in a Letter to the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. On the receiving of which Letter, the King imparts the same to the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> in his Court. Who presently sends his dispatches to the Pope, acquainting him with the great inconveniences and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable dangers of this new design; which being stopt by this device, and the Treaty of the Match ending in a rupture not long

after, the same Jesuite came again to the Lord Keepers Lodging, and in a fair and facetious manner thanked him most humbly for the good office he had done for that Society, for breaking and bearing off which blow all the friends they had in <hi>Rome</hi> could find no buckler. Which Story as I heard from his Lordships own mouth (with no small contentment) so seemed he to be very well pleased with the handsomness of the trick which was put upon him.</p>

                     <hi>Laud</hi> was not sleeping all this while. It was not possible that a man of such an Active Spirit should be out of work, and he had work enough to do in being the Dukes Agent at the Court. The Marquiss was made Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> at his being in <hi>Spain,</hi> to make him more considerable in the eye of that Court: and this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to his honours was an addition also to that envy which was borne against him. Great Favourites have for the most part many enemies, such as are carefully intent upon all occasions which may be made use of to supplant them. Which point the Duke had so well studied; that though he knew himself to be a very great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Kings affections: yet was he apprehensive of the disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to which this long absence would expose him. It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor did it happen other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than he expected, for long he had not been in <hi>Spain,</hi> when there were many fearings of him in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> many strange whisperings into the ears of the King concerning the abuse of his Royal Favours; the general discontentments which appeared in the people for the Princes Journey into <hi>Spain</hi>; the sad conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents which were feared to ensue upon it in reference to his Person, and the true Religion; that the blame of all was by the People laid on the Duke, and that it was safest for his Majecty to let it rest where they had laid it. But nothing could be thought more strange unto him, than that the Lord Keeper <hi>Williams,</hi> and the Lord Treasurer <hi>Cranfield</hi> should be of Counsel in the Plot, both of them being of his raising, and both (in the stile of Court) his Creatures. Of all which practises and proceedings <hi>Laud</hi> gives intelligence to the Duke, and receives back again Directions in his actings for him. (Pity it is that none of these reciprocal Letters have been found to make up the <hi>Cabala,</hi> and to enrich the treasures in the <hi>Scrinea Sacra</hi>) From hence proceeded the constancy of affection which the Duke carried to him for ever, after the Animosity between <hi>Laud</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi>; the fall of <hi>Cranfield</hi> first, and of <hi>Williams</hi> afterwards; <hi>Laud</hi> by his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and fidelity overtopping all.</p>
                  <p>The news of these practices in the Court, made the Duke think of leaving <hi>Spain,</hi> where he began to sink in his Estimation; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting his return to <hi>England,</hi> for fear of sinking lower here than he did

in <hi>Spain.</hi> Some clashings there had been betwixt him and the <hi>Conde d' Olivarez,</hi> the Principal Favorite of that King; and some <hi>Caresses</hi> were made to him by the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> inviting him to be a God-father to one of her Children. In these disquiets and distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he puts the Prince in mind of the other Game he had to play; namely, the Restitution of the Palatinate, which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would not suffer to be brought under the Treaty of the Match; reserving it (as they pretended, and perhaps really intended) to be bestowed by the <hi>Infanta</hi> after the Marriage, the better to ingratiate her self with the <hi>English</hi> Nation. Which being a point of too great moment to depend upon no other assurance than a Court-Complement only, it was concluded by the Prince, That since he could not prevail in the one, he would not proceed to the Consummation of the other.

And that they might come the better to the end they aimed at, they addressed themselves unto the Prince, whom they assured, That they would stand to him in that War, to the very last expence of their Lives and Fortunes; and he accordingly (being further set on by the Duke) became their instrument to perswade his Father to hearken to the Common Votes and Desires of his Subjects, which the King (press'd by their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Importunities) did at the last (but with great unwillingness) as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to: Such was the conduct of this business on the part of the <hi>English.</hi>

                  <p>But it is now time to leave these Foreign Negotiations, and keep close at home, where we shall finde the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi> as busie in seducing the people, and the <hi>Lay-Papists</hi> as audacious in hearing and frequenting <hi>Masses,</hi> as if they had been fortified by a <hi>Toleration.</hi> But it pleased God to put some Water into their Wine, and abate the fervour of those heats, by letting them feel the strokes of his heavy hand, when they look'd not for it. Being assembled in a fair and capacious Room at <hi>Hunsdon</hi> House in the <hi>Black-Friers,</hi> to hear the Sermon of one <hi>Drury</hi> a Jesuit, their numbers were so great, and their weight so heavy, that the Floor sunk under them. Most lamentable were the cries of those which fell under that Ruine, 94 of them (of which the Preacher himself was one) being killed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; most of the rest so miserably bruised and maimed, that the condition of the dead was esteemed far happier than that of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: A matter of great astonishment to their Party here; and that it might not be so abroad, they thought it good to shift the Scene, and change the Actors, publishing to that end a Pamphlet, which they dispersed in divers parts of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> containing a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Judgments shown on a sort of <hi>Protestant Hereticks,</hi> by the fall of an House in St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Parish in <hi>Holborn,</hi> in which they were assembled to hear a <hi>Geneva</hi> Lecture, <hi>October</hi> 26. <hi>A. D.</hi> 1623. So wickedly wise are those of that Generation, to cheat their own Souls, and abuse their Followers. And yet the Pamphleteer says well, That this disaster hapned on the 26th of <hi>October</hi>; for so it did according to the <hi>Old Style</hi> and Account of <hi>England</hi>: But it was on the fifth day of <hi>November,</hi> according to the <hi>New Style</hi> and Account of <hi>Rome.</hi> And this indeed may seem to have somewhat of Gods Judgment in it, That the intended blowing up of the Parliament, to the unavoidable destruction of the King, Prince, Prelates, Peers, and the chiefest Gentry of the Nation, on the fifth day of our <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> should on the fifth day of their own be recompenced or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliated by the sinking of a Room in which they met, to the present slaughter of so many, and the maiming of more.</p>
                  <p>But leaving them to their ill Fortunes, it was not long before <hi>Buckingham</hi> found the truth of such Informations as he had received touching those ill Offices which had been done to him in his absence,

from some whom he esteemed his Friends. Hereupon followed an estranging of the Dukes Countenance from the Lord Keeper <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams,</hi> and of his from the Bishop of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> whom he looked upon as one that stood in the way betwixt him and the Duke: with which the Duke was not long after made acquainted. But these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasures were not only shewn in offended Countenances, but brake out within little time into sharp Expostulations on either side. The Duke complained to <hi>Laud, December</hi> 15. That the Lord Keeper had so strangely forgotten himself to him, as he seemed to be dead in his affections; and began to entertain some thoughts of bringing him by a way which he would not like, to a remembrance of his duty: and on the eleventh of <hi>Ianuary</hi> the Lord Keeper meets with <hi>Laud</hi> in the <hi>Withdrawing Chamber,</hi> and fell into very hot words with him, of which the Duke hath an account also within three days after. But <hi>Williams</hi> seeing how unable he was to contend at once with Wit and Power, applied himself with so much diligence to regain the Favour of the Duke, that in the beginning of <hi>February</hi> a Reconciliation was made between them, the Duke accepting his submission, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him, That his great Favours unto <hi>Laud,</hi> were the chief rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which had moved him unto that forgetfulness. And that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this Reconciliation might extend to all who were concerned in the displeasures, <hi>Williams</hi> engageth to the Duke to be friends with <hi>Laud,</hi> and did accordingly bestow some Complements upon him; but such as had more ceremony than substance in them. From henceforth nothing but an appearance of fair weather between these Great Persons, though at last it brake out again more violently into open Storms. The Wound was only skinned, not healed; and festred the more dangerously, because the secret Rancour of it could not be discerned. In the mean time <hi>Laud</hi> was not wanting to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in taking the benefit of this Truce: <hi>Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ot</hi> had still a spite against him, and was resolved to keep him down as long as he could; to which end he had caused him to be left out of the <hi>High-Commission</hi> (and <hi>Williams</hi> was not forward to put him in) though never a Bishop that lived about <hi>London</hi> was left out but himself, and many who lived not there put in: Of which Indignity he complained to the Duke, by his Letter bearing date <hi>November</hi> 1. 1624. and was reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died in it.</p>
                  <p>During the heat of these Court-combats, the Parliament before-mentioned was assembled at <hi>Westminster,</hi> on the seventeenth of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>; upon whose humble Petition and Advice his Majesty dissolved the Treaties, and engaged himself in a War with <hi>Spain</hi>: But this he had no sooner done, when they found into what perplexities they had plunged themselves by this Engagement; there being nothing more derogatory to the Honour and Prosperity of a King of <hi>England,</hi> than to be cast on the necessity of calling Parliaments, which rendreth them obnoxious to the power and pride of each popular spirit, and makes them less in Reputation both at home and abroad: For first
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54785:62"/>
they Petitioned him for a Fast, which he also granted. They had desired the like in some former Parliaments, and Sessions of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as they had done also in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time; but could never obtain the same from either. It was then told them, That there were weekly Fasts appointed to be kept by the Laws of the Land, which if they did observe, as they ought to do, there would be no need of Solemn Fasts to begin their Parliaments. The blame of which Answer, in the Parliament immediately foregoing this, was by the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction cast upon the Bishops (who at the same time had opposed some Proposition tending to some <hi>Restraints</hi> on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> not imposed before) as men whose Pride hindred all such Religious Humiliations, and whose Profaneness made them Enemies to all Piety. But the King having now cast himself into the arms of his People, had brought himself to a necessity of yielding to their desire, and thereby left a fair President both for them to crave, and his Successor to grant the like: So that from this time forward, till the last of King <hi>Charles,</hi> we shall see no Parliament, nor Session of Parliament, to begin without them; though that King checked some times at the importunity.</p>
                  <p>So far his Majesty had gone along with them, in yielding unto their desires; but he must go a little further. And therefore, secondly, They thought it not enough that his Majesty had made <hi>a Publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration for the real and utter Dissolution of the said Treaties</hi>; but it must be <hi>declared also by Act of</hi> Parliament, <hi>That the said two Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were by his Majesty Dissolved</hi>: Which gave them some colour of Pretence in the following Parliament to claim a share in managing the War (which the Dissolving of these Treaties had occasioned) and of being made acquainted with the Enterprize which was then in hand.
<q>But for this time they were contented to have engaged the King for the future War, toward the carrying on of which, and more particularly (as the Act expresseth) for the Defence of this Realm of <hi>England,</hi>

Which though it be affirmed in the said Act <hi>to be the greatest Aid which ever was granted in Parliament to be levied in so short a time;</hi> yet neither was the time so short as it was pretended, there being almost fifteen Months between the dissolving of the Treaties, and the last payment of the Monies. Nor did the King get any thing by it, how great soever the said Aid was supposed to be. For, thirdly, before the King could obtain this Act, he was fain to gratifie them with some others, amongst which that entituled, <hi>An Act for the general quiet of the Subject against all pretext of</hi> Concealments <hi>whatsoever,</hi> was the most considerable. An Act of such a grand Concernment to the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54785:62"/>
Peace and Happiness of the Subject, and of such Disprofit to the King in his Gifts and Graces to his Servants, that it was affirmed by Justice <hi>Dodderidge</hi> at the <hi>Oxon.</hi> Assises next ensuing, That his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty had bought those <hi>Fifteenths</hi> and <hi>Subsidies</hi> at ten years purchase. Nor fourthly, did one penny of this Money, so dearly paid for, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew unto his Majesties particular use, or was to come into his Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers; it being ordered in the Act aforesaid, That the said Monies, and every part and parcel of them, should be paid to certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners therein nominated; and that the said Commissioners should issue and dispose the same, according as they should be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Carew, Foulk</hi> Lord <hi>Brooke,</hi> and certain other Commissioners to the number of ten, nominated and appointed for a Council of War; by them to be expended in the Publick Service. And albeit the Grant of the said <hi>Fifteenths, Tenths,</hi> and <hi>Subsidies,</hi> might possibly be the <hi>greatest Aid</hi> which had been given in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for <hi>so short a time</hi>; yet did this greatness consist rather in tale than weight, the <hi>Subsidy</hi>-Books being grown so low (for those of the <hi>Fifteenths</hi> and <hi>Tenths</hi> do never vary) that two entire <hi>Subsidies</hi> in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to more than all.</p>

For taking into consideration (amongst other motives) the great Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at which his Majesty was then, and was like to be hereafter, as well for the support of his Royal Estate, as for the necessary Defence of this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and other his Dominions, whereby was like to grow the safety of <hi>Religion</hi> both at whom and abroad; they granted to him four entire <hi>Subsidies,</hi> after the rate of 4 <hi>s.</hi> in every Pound; which was indeed the <hi>greatest Aid</hi> that was ever given by <hi>Convocation</hi> in so <hi>short a time</hi>; the Subsidies of the Clergy being fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and certain, those of the Laity diminishing and decreasing daily. A Burden which must needs fall exceeding heavy on many poor Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars in the Country, whose Benefices are for the most part of small yearly value, and yet rated very high in the Kings Books (according unto which they are to be Taxed); Insomuch as I knew several Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caridges, not worth above 80 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> which were charged high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the best Gentlemen in the Parish, whose yearly Revenues have amounted unto many Hundreds. <hi>Laud</hi> who had sometimes been Vicar of <hi>Stamford</hi> in <hi>Northamptonshire</hi> (as before is said) was very compassionate of the case of these poor men; for whose case he devised a course in this present Session; which being digested into form, he communicated to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily promised to prepare both the King and Prince for the passing of it. This done, he imparted it also to the Lord Keeper <hi>Williams,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> who look'd upon it as the best service which had been done for the Church many years before, and advised him to acquaint the Archbishop with it: But <hi>Abbot</hi> either disliking the Design for the Authors sake, or being an enemy to all Counsels
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54785:63"/>
which had any Author but himself, instead of favours returned him frowns; asking him, What he had to do to make any suit for the Church? And telling him withall, That never any Bishop attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted the like at any time, and that no body would have done it but himself; That he had given the Church such a wound, in speaking to any Lord of the Layty about it, as he could never make whole again; And finally, That if the Lord Duke did fully understand what he had done, he would never endure him to come near him again. St <hi>Davids</hi> replies very mildly, That he thought he had done a very good office for the Church, and so did his betters too; That if his Grace thought otherwise, he was sorry that he had offended: But hoped that he had done it out of a good mind, and for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of many poor Vicars abroad in the Country, who must needs sink under the payment of so many Subsidies; and therefore that his error might be pardonable, if it were an error. Thus soundly ratled he departs, and acquaints the Duke with the success, for fear some ill offices might be otherwise done him to the King and Prince. So miserable was the case of the poorer Clergy, in living under such an <hi>High Priest,</hi> who though he was subject to the same <hi>infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> was altogether <hi>insensible</hi> of those heavy pressures which were laid upon them: It being his Felicity, but their unhappiness, that he was never Parson, Vicar, nor Curate; and therefore the less care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or compassionate of their hard condition.</p>
                  <p>Before the rising of this Parliament (which was on the twenty ninth of <hi>May</hi>) came out a book of Dr. <hi>Whites,</hi> entituled, <hi>A Reply to Iesuite Fishers Answer to certain Questions</hi> propounded by his most Gracious Majesty King <hi>IAMES.</hi>

And thereupon it pleased him to have nine Questions of Controversie propounded to the Jesuite, that he might in writing manifest the Grounds and Arguments whereupon the <hi>Popish</hi> Faith in those Points were builded. Now the nine Points were these that follow: 1. <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Images.</hi> 2. <hi>Prayings and Oblations to the blessed Virgin</hi> Mary. 3. <hi>Worshipping and Invocation of Saints and Angels.</hi> 4. <hi>The Lyturgie and private Prayers for the Ignorant in an unknown tongue.</hi> 5. <hi>Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of Pater-nosters, Aves, and Creeds, especially affixing a kind of merit to the number of them.</hi> 6. <hi>The Doctrine of Transubstantiation.</hi> 7. <hi>Communion under one kind, and the abetting of it by Concomitancy.</hi> 8. <hi>Works of Supererogation, especially with reference to the treasure of the Church.</hi> 9. <hi>The opinion of Deposing Kings, and giving away their Kingdoms by Papal power, whether directly or indirectly?</hi> To these nine Questions the Jesuite returned a close and well-wrought An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, the unraveling whereof was by the King committed to this

Dr. <hi>White,</hi> for his encouragement and reward made one of his Majesties Chaplains in Ordinary, and Dean of <hi>Carlile.</hi> This book being finished at the Press about the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with published to others, was very welcom to most moderate and learned men; the rather in regard that the third of those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, which was that between <hi>Laud</hi> and <hi>Fisher,</hi> was subjoyned to it.</p>

                     <q>The cause (saith he) why the discourse upon this <hi>Conference</hi> staid so long before it could endure to be pressed. It was neither my <hi>Idleness,</hi> nor my unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness to right both my self and the cause against the <hi>Iesuite</hi> which occasioned this delay; For I had then most Honourable Witnesses, and have some yet living, that this discourse was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed long before I could perswade my self to let it come into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick view: And this was caused partly by reason there was about the same time three <hi>Conferences</hi> held with <hi>Fisher,</hi> of which this was the third; and could not therefore conveniently come abroad into the world till the two former were ready to lead the way, which till now they were not. And this is in part the reason also why this Tract crept into the end of a larger work; For since that <hi>work</hi> contained in a manner the substance of all that passed in the two former <hi>Conferences</hi>; and that this <hi>third</hi> in divers points concurred with them, and depended on them, I could not think it <hi>Substantive</hi> enough to stand alone. But besides this <hi>affinity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Conferences,</hi> I was willing to have it pass, as silently as it might, at the end of another work, and so perhaps little to be looked after, because I could not hold it worthy (nor can I yet) of that great duty and service which I owe to my dear mother t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The seasonable publishing of these two Books did much conduce
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54785:64"/>
to the advancement of his Majesties Service. The Commons at that time had been hammering a sharp Remonstrance against the Papists, as if there were no enemies of the Religion here established to be feared but they. In the Preface to which Petition, they took notice of so many dangers threatned both to the Church and State by the power and practises of the Papist, as if the King had took no care to preserve the one, or suppress the other: Which Petition, being brought to the House of Lords, was there so abbreviated, that the Preamble was quite left out, and the many branches of it reduced to two particulars: First, That all Laws and Statutes, formerly made against Jesuites, Seminary Priests, and other Popish Recusants, might from thenceforth be put into execution. Secondly, That he would engage himself by his Royal Word, that upon no occasion of Marriage or Treaty, or other request in that behalf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he would slaken the execution of the Laws against them. Which Petition being presented to his Majesty by a Committee of both Houses on the tenth of <hi>April</hi>; after some deliberation he returned this Answer to it, <hi>viz. That the Laws against Iesuites and Popish Recusants should be put into due execution from thenceforth,</hi> &amp;c. And it appeared by the coming out of these said two Books within few daies after, that as his Majesty had granted them their desires, in causing the said Laws against Priests and Jesuites to be duly executed; so he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken special care, not only to preserve Religion in her Purity, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing the most material Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>: but to preserve his people also from being seduced by the practises of the Priests and Jesuites.</p>
                  <p>Which notwithstanding the Commons remaining still unsatisfied, betook themselves to the framing of another Petition, in which it was desired that all such persons as were either Papists, or suspected to be Papists, or had not received the Communion within the space of one whole year, or whose Wives, or any of their Servants were Recusants, or suspected to be so, might be removed from all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions of charge and trust, from being Justices of the Peace, or bearing any Office in the Common Wealth. But this Petition was not made ready for the Lords till the twentieth of <hi>May</hi> next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and being then reported to them by the Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> they did proceed no further in it. The Commons in the mean time had been wholly busied in the Prosecution of the Lord Treasurer <hi>Cranfield,</hi> whom at last they brought unto his Sentence. A Gentleman he was by birth, but had his breeding in the City, from whence by his own wit and industry he preferred himself into the Court, where he was first made Master of the Wardrobe, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Master of the Wards, and finally advanced by the power and favour of the Duke, (one of whose Kinswomen he had married) to the office of Lord Treasurer, and the honour of being made the first Earl of <hi>Middlesex.</hi> In this Office he had disobliged the Prince, when he was in <hi>Spain,</hi> by disswading and diverting those Large Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54785:64"/>
which were required for the maintaining of his Port in a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Kingdom. And he had disobliged the Duke, by joyning in some secret practises to make him grow less and less in his Majesties Favour. They had both served the turn of the Commons, in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King by their continual importunities to dissolve the Treatie. And the Commons must now serve their turn in prosecuting this man to his final destruction: Which they pursued so effectually, that in the end he was sentenced in the House of Lords to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Office of Lord High Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> to be fined fifty thousand Pounds, and remain a Prisoner in the Tower during his Majesties will and pleasure. It was moved also to degrade him from all Titles of honour, but in that the Bishops stood his Friends and dasht the motion.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Cranfield</hi> sell, and <hi>Williams</hi> did not stand long after. <hi>Laud</hi> was now brought into an higher degree of credit with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> than he was before, by means whereof he came to be of great power and authority with him. Insomuch that when the Duke fell sick of an Ague in the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> he was extreme impatient in his Fits till <hi>Laud</hi> came to visit him; by whom he was so charmed and sweetned, that at first he endured his Fits with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and by that patience did so break their heats and violences, that at last they left him. From this time forwards he was not used only as a Confessor, but a Counsellor also imployed by him; in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and advising whether the great endowments belonging to the Hospitals founded in the dissolved house of <hi>Carthusian</hi> Monks (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, but corruptly, called the <hi>Charter-House</hi>) might not be inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the maintenance of an Army for the present Wars, as well for his Majesties advantage, as the case of the Subject. And to this Proposition (as it seems) he returned a Negative, for I find not that the business advanced any further. He liked not any inversions or alienations of that nature, lest being drawn into example, the Lands of Colledges or Cathedral Churches might in like manner be imployed unto secular uses. Besides, he could not choose but know, that a project had been set on foot about ten years before, for the Entituling of the King to all <hi>Sutton</hi>'s Lands; which proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly might have succeeded, if <hi>Coke,</hi> then being Lord Chief Justice, and one of the Trustees for erecting the Hospital, had not stood stoutly to his trust. By which though he got the Kings displeasure, yet amongst others he preserved the reputation of an honest man. And <hi>Laud</hi> might very well conclude, that he who durst oppose the King when he was in his favour, would be found more intractable at this time when he was in disgrace; which rendred him the less sollicitous to appear in a business not otherwise approved of by him: But in another point, which was more to his liking, and lay within the spheare of his activity, he gave him as much satisfaction as he had desired. This was the giving him the heads of <hi>Doctrinal Puritanism,</hi> that is to say, the Heads of such Doctrines as were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54785:65"/>
by those of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, though not maintained by them as <hi>Puritans,</hi> but as <hi>Calvinists</hi> only. The Duke had a desire to know them, and he served him in it. I must needs say, the name of <hi>Doctrinal Puritanism</hi> is not very ancient, but whether first taken up by the Archbishop of <hi>Spalato</hi> at his being here,<note place="margin">

                     </note> I am not able to say; Nor am I of opinion, that <hi>Puritan</hi> and <hi>Calvinian</hi> are terms convertible. For though all <hi>Puritans</hi> are <hi>Calvinians,</hi> both in doctrine and practise, yet all <hi>Calvinians</hi> are not to be counted as <hi>Puritans</hi> also; whose practises many of them abhor, and whose inconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities they detest, though by the errour of their Education, or ill direction in the Course of their Studies, they may, and do agree with them in some points of Doctrine.

Which last Points having been hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agitated, for twenty years last past, in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, did now begin to exercise the Church of <hi>England</hi> upon this occasion. The Priests and Jesuites having been very busie of late in gaining Proselites, and sowing their erronious Doctrines, had got a haunt in a Village of the County of <hi>Essex,</hi> called <hi>Stanford-Rivers.</hi> The Rector of that Church was <hi>Richard Montague,</hi>

Desirous to free his Parish from this haunt, he left some Propositions at the house of one of his Neighbours, which had been frequently visited with these <hi>Night-Spirits,</hi> with this Declaration thereunto, that if any of those which ranged that walk could convince him in any of the same, he would immediately subscribe and be a <hi>Papist.</hi> After long expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, instead of answering to his <hi>queries,</hi> one of them leaves a short Pamphlet for him, entituled, <hi>A new Gag for the Old Gospell,</hi> in which it was pretended, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Protestants</hi> should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed out of the very words of their own English Bibles. This book he was required to answer, and found it no such knotty piece, but that it might be cleft in sunder, without Beetle or Wedges. But in perusing of that book, he found, that besides some few Doctrines which properly and truly did belong to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> there were crouded into it all Points of <hi>Calvinism,</hi> such <hi>Heterodoxies,</hi> and out-landish Fancies, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> never owned. And therefore in his Answer to that <hi>Popish Gagger</hi> he severed or discriminated the <hi>opinions</hi> of particular men, from the Authorized Doctrines of this Church; leaving the one to be maintained by their

private <hi>Fautors,</hi> and only defending and maintaining the other. And certainly had he not been a man of a mighty Spirit, and one that easily could contemn the cry and clamours which were raised against him for so doing, he could not but have sunk remedilesly under the burden of disgrace, and the fears of Ruine which that performance drew upon him.</p>
                  <p>This Book came out about the latter end of <hi>December,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out made such a general amazement amongst those of the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Party, that they began to fear the sad consequents of it. The opening of this secret was of such importance, that if the Author and his Book were not speedily crushed, they must no longer shroud their private opinions under the name of the received Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; excluded from that Sanctuary, they could find no place of strength and sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet such was the temper of those Times, that whosoever held any of the Points aforesaid, or any other controverted with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary to the sense of <hi>Calvin,</hi> must presently be accused of <hi>Popery.</hi> He that adhered unto the Tendries of the Ancient Fathers, in such particulars as the Church was pleased to leave undetermined; or bound himself in matters publickly resolved on, to vindicate this Church to her <hi>genuine</hi> Tenents, was present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made Subject to all those Clamors and Reproaches, which the Tongues and Pens of that Predominating Faction could either raise upon him, or asperse him with. <hi>Laud</hi> had found good experience of it when he lived in <hi>Oxon.</hi> and so had <hi>Houson</hi> and <hi>Corbet</hi> too, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was noted. But none of them were able to break through those difficulties, till <hi>Mountague</hi> took the Work in hand; who being well back'd, and having the Ice somewhat broke before him, waded with confidence and courage through the middest of those Waters, which otherwise might have overwhelmed the most tried Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer.</p>
                  <p>In the next place it will be no hard work to finde what they meant by <hi>Arminianism</hi>; under which name they comprehend the <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthonian</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Predestination, The Vniversal Redemption of Mankind by the Death of Christ, The cooperation of the Will of Man with the Grace of God</hi>; and, <hi>The Possibility of falling from Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:</hi> All which appear by plain and evident proofs in our said <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction,</hi> to have been the true original and native Doctrines of this

And so it stood till th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> breaking out of the <hi>Predestinarian</hi> Quarrels in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, between <hi>Arminius</hi> and his Followers on the one side, and the <hi>Rigid Calvinians</hi> on the other. The Books which had been written on both sides, being purposely dispersed abroad, to encourage and encrease their several Parties, cross'd over the Seas into <hi>England</hi> also; where being diligently studied, either out of curiosity, or desire of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they awaked many out of that dead sleep in which they were, to look with better eyes into the true and native Doctrines of this Church, than before they did. Amongst the first which publikly appeared that way at <hi>Oxon.</hi> after the coming out of the said Books, were <hi>Laud</hi> and <hi>Houson,</hi> whom <hi>Abbot</hi> then Doctor of the <hi>Chair,</hi> and <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> also, exposed to as much disgrace as by his Place and Power he could lay upon them. Amongst the first at <hi>Cambridge</hi> were <hi>Tompson,</hi> a <hi>Dutchman</hi> by original (if I be not mistaken in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e man) and <hi>Richardson</hi> the Master of <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge. The first of these had writ a Book touching <hi>Falling away from Grace,</hi> entituled, <hi>De Intercisione Gratiae, &amp; Iustificationis</hi>; to which <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Oxon.</hi> above-mentioned returned an Answer. The other being a <hi>corpulent</hi> man, was publickly reproach'd in S. <hi>Maries</hi> Pulpit in his own Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, by the name of a <hi>Fat-bellied Arminian.</hi> By that name they were called in <hi>Holland,</hi> which adhered not unto <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Doctrine, though many had formerly maintained these Opinions in those Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, before <hi>van Harmine</hi> came to the Chair of <hi>Leyden.</hi> And by that name they must be called in <hi>England</hi> also, though the same Doctrines had been here publickly Authorised and Taught before he was born. So that the entitling of these Doctrines to the name of <hi>Arminius,</hi> seems to be like the nominating of the great <hi>Western Continent</hi> by the name of <hi>America</hi>; of which first <hi>Christopher Columbus,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the two <hi>Cabots,</hi> Father and Son, had made many great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Discoveries, before <hi>Americus Vestputius</hi> ever saw those Shores. Howsoever these Doctrines must be called by the name of <hi>Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi> and by that name <hi>Mountague</hi> stands accused by the two <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> though he protests in his <hi>Appeal,</hi> That he had never seen any of the Writings of <hi>Arminius;</hi> and that he did no otherwise main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain those Doctrines, than as they were commended to him by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and justified by the unanimous Consent of the Ancient Fathers. But of this man, and the pursuance of these Quarrels, we shall hear more shortly.</p>
                  <p>These matters being thus laid together, let us look back on some former Passages which preceded <hi>Mountagues</hi> Disputes. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons had obtained their ends, in dissolving all Treaties with the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54785:67"/>
King of <hi>Spain</hi>; but lost their hopes of Marrying the Prince to a Lady of their own Religion. His Majesty would not look beneath a Crown, to finde a Marriage for his Son; and no Crown could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him a better Wife for his Son, than a Daughter of <hi>France.</hi> The Prince had seen the Lady at the Court in <hi>Paris,</hi> and the King as much desired to see her in the Court of <hi>England.</hi> Upon this ground the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> is dispatch'd privately into <hi>France,</hi> to see how the Queen-Mother and her Ministers, who then Governed the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of that King, would approve the Match; to which at first they seemed so chear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ully inclined, that they did not seem to stand upon any Conditions: But no sooner had they found, that the Breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Majesty and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was grown irreparable, and that both sides prepared for War, but they knew how to make their best advantage of it. They thought themselves to be every way as considerable as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were; and would abate nothing of those Terms which had been obtained by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in reference either to the Princess her self, or in favour of the <hi>English</hi> Catholicks: And to these Terms, when they saw no better could be gotten, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and the Prince consented. But such a Spirit of Infatuation was at that time upon the People, that they who on the 23d. of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> before had celebrated the Dissolving of the Treaties with <hi>Spain</hi> with B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">1625.</note>We must begin the next year with the Death of King <hi>Iames,</hi> and therefore think it not amiss to take a brief view of the Condition of the Church and State, at the time of his departing from us. He had spent all his life in Peace, but died in the beginning of a War: A War which had been drawn upon him by dissolving the Treaties, to which he was as it were constrained, by the continual importunity of the Prince and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> The Duke knew well, that he could not do a more popular act, than to gratifie the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in that business; and had easily possess'd the Prince with this opinion, That as his future Greatness must be built on the Love of his People, so nothing could oblige them more, than to be instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in dissolving the present Treaties. But herein they consulted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their own private Passions, than the publick Interest of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54785:67"/>
Crown; and they shall both pay dear enough for it in a very short space: For there is nothing more unsafe for a King of <hi>England,</hi> than to cast himself upon the necessity of calling Parliaments, and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Purse of the Subject; by means whereof he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self obnoxious to the humour of any prevailing Member in the House of Commons, and becomes less in Reputation both at home and abroad. The Church he left beleaguer'd by two great Enemies; assaulted openly by the <hi>Papist</hi> on the one side, undermined by the <hi>Puritans</hi> on the other. Of the audaciousness of the <hi>Papists</hi> we have spoke already, abated somewhat by the Fall at <hi>Black-friers,</hi> more by the dissolving the two Treaties about four Months after. For though they made some use of the <hi>French</hi> by this new Alliance, yet they resolved to fasten no dependance upon that Crown; insomuch that many of those, who greedily embraced such Favours as were obtained for them by the Treaties with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> would not accept the same when they were procured by the Match with <hi>France</hi>; for which being asked the Reason, they returned this Answer, That they would not change an old Friend for a new, of the continuance of whose Favours they could have no certainty; and who by suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hereticks</hi> in his own Dominions, declared himself no fit Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor for the <hi>Catholick Cause.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>More secret were the <hi>Puritans</hi>; but nothing the less dangerous, because more secret. Finding they could effect nothing in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, either by their publick clamours, or their open practises, they cunningly wrought themselves into a <hi>State-Faction,</hi> and play'd their Game under the colour of Advancing the Civil Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Subject, and the preservation of Religion here by Law established: To which end they continually allarm'd this King with fears and dangers from the <hi>Papists</hi> (as before was said) that all mens eyes being turned that way, they might carry on their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs without discovery. In which they imitated the old stratagem or some politick Captains, who having made great noise, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared all things ready for an Assault on the one side of a Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged, and thereby drawn all the strength of the Town to make good that side, suddenly caused it to be fallen upon in another place, which they found destitute and unprovided of all defence. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving served their Appreticeships in the Reign of this King, we shall finde them strong enough in the first Parliament of his Son and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, to set up for themselves. Hitherto they had worked under the ground like Moles or Wants, without being discovered; but then they began to cast up the Earth before them: and having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a Bill for making way to their Lords-day-<hi>Sabbath,</hi> under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of suppresing unlawful Pastimes and Assemblies, they pressed that King to it, and obtained it; some further addition to which Act they procured in his third Parliament also. Yet still they kept on foot their pretended Zeal against the Papists, and seemed exceeding sensible of the Dangers which were threatned by them; not so much
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54785:68"/>
to advance their own Party, then grown strong enough (as they had done formerly); but to make it serve them as a Property to put by the Business of the King in the Grant of <hi>Subsidies,</hi> whensoever he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it of them,</p>
                  <p>In this condition of Affairs King <hi>Iames</hi> departs this Life at <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balds,</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 27th. of <hi>March</hi>; his Disease no other than an <hi>Ague</hi>; which though it fell on him in the <hi>Spring,</hi> yet it crossed the Proverb, and proved not Medicinal, but Mortal. His Character hath been given by many others, and therefore I may well spare mine, looking upon him only in his zeal to the Church, and his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections unto Learning. His zeal to Unity and Uniformity in the Church, appeared in <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Conference</hi> at <hi>Hampton Court, Anno</hi> 1603. by his directions sent to the University of <hi>Oxon,</hi> 1616. by those to the Archbishops and their several <hi>Suffragans,</hi> 1622. In <hi>Scotland,</hi> by his Restitution of <hi>Episcopacy, Anno</hi> 1610. by the Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> 1618. and by the Grounds laid for the Publick <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> at the <hi>Assembly</hi> in <hi>Aberdeen, Anno</hi> 1616. Had he been well followed by his Bishops, and other Publick Ministers in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Kingdoms, he would have left the Church established on so sure a Foundation, that neither secret Practises could have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it, nor open Batteries have distressed it. His great affections unto Learning do appear as visibly, by the encouragement which he gave unto it both in his Person and Example. In the beginning of his Reign, <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. he graciously received the <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> of <hi>Oxon.</hi> together with the Doctors, Proctors, and Heads of Houses, at his <hi>Mannor</hi> of <hi>Woodstock:</hi> And within two years after, <hi>Anno</hi> 1605. he accepted a Solemn Entertainment from them, performed in all manner of <hi>Scholastick Exercises,</hi> Divinity, Law, Physick, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy; in all of which he shewed himself of such great Abilities, that he might have governed in those <hi>Chairs,</hi> as well as all or any of his three Professors. Being informed how small and insufficient their old Salary was, he added to his Professor for Divinity, and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors in that place, the next Prebend of <hi>Christ-church,</hi> as soon as any should be void, and the Rectory of <hi>Evelme</hi> in the County of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> to the Doctor of the Chair for <hi>Law,</hi> the Corps of a good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend in the Church of <hi>Salisbury</hi>; and to the Professors place for Physick, the Government of an Hospital in <hi>Evelme</hi> aforesaid, being within ten miles of the University.</p>
                  <p>Incouraged by which Examples, two Mathematick Lectures were founded by Sir <hi>Henry Savile</hi> Provost of <hi>Eaton,</hi> and Warden of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Colledge; An <hi>History Lecture</hi> by <hi>William Cambden,</hi> one of the Kings at Arms, by the name of <hi>Clarencieux</hi>; A Lecture in <hi>Natural Philosophy,</hi> by Sir <hi>William Sidley</hi> Knight and Baronet; In <hi>Moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,</hi> by Doctor <hi>Thomas White</hi> one of the <hi>Residentiaries</hi> of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and Prebend of <hi>Christ-Church</hi>; All of them of a liberal and large Endowment. After all which an <hi>Anatomy Lecture</hi> was set up by <hi>Richard Tomlins</hi> of the City of <hi>Westminster,</hi> as necessary as any of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54785:68"/>
rest, though not so plentifully Endowed. The poor man casting in his <hi>Mite</hi> (almost all he had) amongst those Rich <hi>Offerings.</hi> But the powerful Influences of his Learning and Government produce a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther operation than the Instituting of a few particular <hi>Lectures</hi>; even to the Building and Endowing of some, and Beautifying of many other Colledges in that University; Witness that fair and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Colledge, built by <hi>Nicholas Wadham</hi> and <hi>Dorothy</hi> his Wife, <hi>Anno</hi> 1612. The turning of <hi>Broadgates</hi> Hall into <hi>Pembroke</hi> Colledge, built and endowed at the Charges of <hi>Thomas Tisdale</hi> of <hi>Glymton</hi> in the Court of <hi>Oxon.</hi> appropriated in a manner to the Free-Grammar-School of <hi>Abingdon, Anno</hi> 1624. Witness the raising of the old Schools to a goodly and magnificent Structure, the adding of a new Quadrangle unto <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge by the prudent care of Sir <hi>Henry Savil</hi>; the reducing of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and the making up of <hi>Iesus</hi> Colledge into form Quadrangular, by adding of a neat Chappel and a fair Hall to each; of which the Chappel of <hi>Iesus</hi> Colledge (being built together with the Hall, at such time as Sir <hi>Eubule Thelwall</hi> was Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of it) was Consecrated by the Right Reverend Doctor <hi>Houson</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Oxon, May</hi> 28. 1621. The other built at the sole Charges of Doctor <hi>Hackwell</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Surrey,</hi> received Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration from the same hands, <hi>October</hi> 5. 1624. And finally, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness a large and capacious piece of Ground, inclosed with a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Quadrangular Wall, for a <hi>Physick-Garden,</hi> the first Stone where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was laid in a Solemn Assembly of the whole University on St. <hi>Iames</hi> his day, <hi>Iuly</hi> 25. 1622. Not to say any thing of the great cost bestowed in beautifying the Quires of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> and <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalens,</hi> the setting up of a fair new Organ in the Chappel of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Colledge, by the procurement of our <hi>Laud,</hi> the then Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of it, <hi>Anno</hi> 1618. The like fair Organ made and set up in <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> and the old one given to St. <hi>Maries</hi> for the publick use of the University, about six years after. Such and so many Benefactions in one University, and that too in so short a space, as none of the former Times can parallel, so let it be the wonder and amazement of all Ages following.</p>
                  <p>But the King dies, though his Munificence survive him. It was then <hi>Midlent-Sunday,</hi> and the Court-Sermon at <hi>Whitehall</hi> (according to the ancient Custom) in the after-noon: At what time the sad News passing through <hi>London,</hi> began to be rumored in the Court, as <hi>Laud</hi> was going into the Pulpit to preach before the Lords of the Council, the Officers of the Houshold, and the rest of that great Concourse of all sorts of People which usually repaired thither at those Solemn Sermons. Before he was come to the middle of it, the certainty of the Kings death (more generally known amongst them) the confusion which he saw in the faces of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, his own griefs, and the dolorous complaints made by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> occasioned him to leave the Pulpit, and to bestow his pains and comforts where there was more need. He did
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54785:69"/>
not think (as I believe few wise men do) that the carrying on of one particular Sermon was such a necessary part of <hi>Gods business,</hi> as is not to be intermitted upon any occasion, nor was this ever charged upon him amongst his crimes. The sense of this great loss being somewhat abated, he was requested by the Duke to draw up some Remembrances, of the Life, Reign, and Government of the King Deceased, which he accordingly performed and presented to him: But they are but Remembrances or Memorials only, like the first lines of a design or Picture, which being polished and perfected by a skil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ul Workman, might have presented us with the true and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pourtraiture of that gracious Prince. But who will undertake to finish what <hi>Laud</hi> began? I must therefore leave the deceased King to those Memorials, and those <hi>Memorials</hi> to be found in his <hi>Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,</hi> p. 5. But there was another Pourtraiture provided for that King before his Funeral. His Body being brought from <hi>Theobalds</hi> unto <hi>Sommerset-house,</hi> where a Royal and Magnificent Hearse was erected for him, visited and resorted to by infinite multitudes of people, for some Weeks together. From <hi>Sommerset-house</hi> his Body was carried in great State, on <hi>Saturday</hi> the seventh of <hi>May,</hi> to St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church in <hi>Westminster,</hi> where it was solemnly interred. The Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sermon preached by the Lord Keeper <hi>Williams,</hi> and printed not long after by the name of <hi>Great Britains Solomon</hi>; which afterwards administred the occasion of some discourse, which otherwise might have been spared.</p>
                  <p>Thus is <hi>Iames</hi> dead and buried, but the King survives, his only Son Prince <hi>Charles</hi> being immediately proclaimed King of Great <hi>Britain, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> first at the Court Gates, by Sir <hi>Edward Zouch</hi> Knight Marshal, most solemnly the next day at <hi>London,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by degrees in all the Cities and Market Towns of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. At his first entrance on the Crown he found himself ingaged in a war with the K. of <hi>Spain,</hi> the mightiest Monarch of the <hi>West,</hi> for which he was to raise great Forces both by Sea and Land. He was also at the Point of Marriage with the Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> and some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable preparations must be made for that. Nor was King <hi>Iames</hi> to be interred without a solemn and magnificent Funeral, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable in the full height to so great a Prince. All which must needs exact great Sums of money, and money was not to be had without the help of a Parliament, which he therefore gave order to be called in the usual manner. But in the middest of these many and great preparations he forgets not the great business of the Church. He had observed the multitudinousness of his Fathers Chaplains, and the disorder of their waitings, which puts him on a Resolution of reducing them to a lesser number, and limiting them to a more certain time of attendance than before they were. He knew well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so what an influence the Court had alwaies on the Country; by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence how much it did concern him in his future Government that his Officers and Servants should be rightly principled, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54785:69"/>
to the Doctrine, Government, and Forms of Worship establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And therefore that he might be served with <hi>Orthodox</hi> and Regular men, <hi>Laud</hi> is commanded to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Catalogue of the most eminent Divines, and to distinguish them by the two Letters of <hi>O</hi> and <hi>P.</hi> according to their several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions and affections. And that being done, he is directed by the Duke and the Kings appointment to have recourse to the most learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Breviate</hi> p. 6.</note> to know of him what he thought fitting to be done in the Cause of Religion; Especially in reference to the five Articles condemned not long since in the <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Dort,</hi> and to report his answer with convenient speed. A Convocation was of course to accompany the ensuing Parliament. And it was fit not only that the Prelates should resolve before-hand what Points they meant to treat on when they were assembled, but that his Majesty also might have time to consider of them.</p>
                  <p>These seasonable cares being thus passed over, he hastens both his own marriage, and his Fathers Funeral: The first he sollemnized by Proxie in the Church of <hi>Nostre Dame</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> on Sunday the first of <hi>May</hi> according to the Style of <hi>England.</hi> The news whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to the Court, on the <hi>Wednesday</hi> following was celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Streets of <hi>London,</hi> the Liberties and out-parts of it, with more than ordinary Expressions of Joy and Gladness. The Proxie made to <hi>Claud. de Lorain,</hi> Duke of <hi>Chevereux,</hi> one of the younger Sons of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>; from which House his Majesty derived himself by his great Grand-Mother <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Lorain,</hi> Wife of <hi>Iames</hi> the Fifth. The Funeral he attended in his own Person, as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Mourner:</hi> Which though it were contrary to the Custome of his Predecessors, yet he chose rather to express his Piety in attending the dead Body of his Father to the Funeral Pile, than to stand upon any such old niceties and points of State. This was the third Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral which he had attended as the principal Mourner, which gave some occasion to presage that he would prove a man of sorrows, and that his end would carry some proportion to those mournful begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. The Intervall before the coming of his Queen he spent in looking to his <hi>Navy,</hi> and drawing his Land Forces together for that Summers service: But hearing that his Queen was advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him he went to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and rested there on <hi>Trinity</hi> Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the twelfth of <hi>Iune.</hi> That night he heard the news of her safe arrival at the Port of <hi>Dover,</hi> whom he welcomed the next morning into <hi>England</hi> with the most chearful signs of a true a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From thence he brought her unto <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and from thence by easie Stages to <hi>Gravesend,</hi> where entring in their Royal Barge, attended by infinite companies of all sorts of People, and entertained by a continual peal of Ordnance all the way they passed, he brought her safely and contentedly unto his Palace at <hi>Westminster.</hi> The Lords and Ladies of the Court having presented to her the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their humble duties, such Bishops as were about the Town
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54785:70"/>
(as most of them were, in regard of the Parliament and Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) were admitted to the kiss of her hand, whom she most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously received.</p>
                  <p>For on the <hi>Saturday</hi> before, being <hi>Iune</hi> the eighteenth, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had took beginning. Which fell out not unseasonably, that the <hi>French</hi> Lords might see with what Royal Magnificence he was attended by the Prelates, Peers, and other Officers of State (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his own Domestick Servants) to the Parliament House. At their first meeting he put them in mind of the War, in which they had engaged his Father, and of the promise they had made to stand to him in it with their lives and fortunes; That both his Land and Sea Forces were now in readiness to set forwards; And, That there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing but a present supply of money to quicken and expedite the affaire; That the eyes of all Christendom were fixt upon him; And that if he should miscarry in his first attempt, it would blemish all the honour of his future actions; And therefore, That they should endeavour to deliver him out of that War in which they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred (he hoped it would never be said that they had betrayed) him. In answer whereunto, the Commons past a Bill of two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidies only, so short of that excessive charge which the maintenance of so great a Fleet and Army required at their hands, that being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed amongst the Officers, Souldiers, and Mariners, it would scarce have served for <hi>Advance-money</hi> to send them going. Which notwithstanding, he very graciously accepted of it, taking it as an <hi>earnest</hi> of their good affections, in reference to the greater Sums which were to follow. In order whereunto he audited his account unto them, as well for such moneys as had remained undisbursed of the former aides, as for the defraying of such further Charges as his present Fleet, consisting of 120 Sail, and a considerable Land Army, must needs lay upon him. The particulars of which account stood thus: <hi>viz.</hi> 32000 pounds for securing of <hi>Ireland;</hi> 47000 pounds for strengthning the Forts; 37000 pounds for the repair of the Navy; 99000 pounds upon the four English Regiments in the States Country; 62000 pounds laid out for Count <hi>Mansfield</hi>; Totall 287000 pounds. Besides which he sent in a demand of 200000 pounds and upwards upon the Navy; 48000 pounds upon the Ordnance; 45000 pounds in Charges of the Land men; 20000 pounds a month to Count <hi>Mansfield</hi>; and 46000 pounds to bring down the King of <hi>Denmarke;</hi> the totall of which latter Sum amounts to 339000 pounds. Both Sums make no less than 626000 pounds, to which the Grant of two Subsidies holds but small propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>But the Commons had other game to follow. Their <hi>Grievances</hi> must first be heard: A List whereof they had presented to King <hi>IAMES</hi> toward the end of the former Parliament; of which the greatest part were still unredressed. To these his Majesty vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed a very gracious, and for the most part a full and satisfactory
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54785:70"/>
Answer. Amongst which <hi>Grievances,</hi> a sober and discreet man would not think to find, that the building of all houses in <hi>London,</hi> and the parts adjoyning, in one uniform way, with a face of brick toward the streets should be passed for one, then which there could not be a greater ornament to that City, or a greater honour to his Majesties Government. And to that his Majesty returned this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: That there had much good come by such a reformation of Building in his Fathers time, and therefore that he was resolved to go on with the work. Which Resolution so much tending to the glory of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and no objection being ready for his other Answers, the matter of Grievances could no longer be insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted on; especially in such a time when the concernments of the State, his Majesties honour, and all the motives which induced them to ingage him in this present War, ought in all reason to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede their <hi>Grievances,</hi> had they been greater than they were. But then they had some Religious <hi>Grievances,</hi> which required a more speedy redress than any which concerned them in their Civil Interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. The Lords day was pretended to be much profaned by unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pastimes, and People frequently resorted out of their own Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes to feast in Revels. Of this a remedy is desired by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Had any such Bill been offered in King <hi>Iames</hi> his time, it would have found a sorry welcome; but this King being under a necessity of compliance with them, resolved to grant them their desires in that Particular, to the end that they might grant his also in the aide required, when that obstruction was removed. The <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batarians</hi> took the benefit of this opportunity for the obtaining of this grant (the first that ever they obtained by all their struglings) which of what consequence it was we shall see hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But then the Doctrine of the Church was more in danger than ever. In former Parliaments they were afraid of the Papists only: But now there was as much danger to be feared from <hi>Arminianism</hi> as before from <hi>Popery.</hi> An Information had been made by <hi>Yales</hi> and <hi>Ward,</hi> as before is said, against some passages in <hi>Mountagues</hi> Answer to the <hi>Romish Gagger</hi>; and he had agravated his offence by justifying all his <hi>Popish,</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenents in a book newly published, called <hi>Appello Caesarem.</hi> It could not be denied, but that this book was Licenced by Dr. <hi>White,</hi> then Dean of <hi>Carlile,</hi> by whom it was affirmed to be agreeable to the Publick Faith, Doctrine, and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline established in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But <hi>White</hi> they said was now turned <hi>black,</hi> and what is the Established Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> compared with <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrine in his <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>? What Trifles are the Articles of Religion, agreed on by the Bishops and Clergy, in two several <hi>Synods</hi> held in <hi>London,</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the determinations of the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> which <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi> (that bold man) had despised and vilified? This was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which became the care of the House of Commons, and <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi> is cited to appear before them on the seventh of <hi>Iuly.</hi> Being
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54785:71"/>
brought unto the Bar, the Speaker declared to him the pleasure of the House, which was, that they would refer his Censure to the next meeting; and that in the interim he should stand committed to the Serjeants Ward; and entred baile for his appearance to the value of two thousand pound. His Majesty had present notice of this occurrence;<note place="margin">

                           </gap>te</hi> p. 6.</note> And being very sensible of this new incroachment, he thereupon caused intimation to be made unto them, that he was not pleased with their proceedings against <hi>Mountague,</hi> being one of his Chaplains; adding withall that he conceived his Servants to be as capable of protection from all imprisonments and arrests, as any of the Servants of the <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Burgesses.</hi> It was not long before <hi>Laud</hi> found an opportunity to give <hi>Mountague</hi> notice of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties great care of him, and affection to him. Which must needs be a Soveraign Cordial to the man, notwithstanding that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were so stiff in their Rigors toward him that his bail-bond of 2000 pound did remain uncancelled.</p>
                  <p>Notice hereof being given to <hi>Laud,</hi> he considered of the sad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and consequents which might follow on it, communicating those his fears to some other Bishops: By whom it was thought fit that <hi>Mountagues</hi> case, and not his only, but the case of the Church it self, should be commended to the care and power of the Duke of of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> According unto which Advice and Resolution, three of them framed and signed the ensuing Letter. But before this Letter was delivered, <hi>Mountague</hi> had taken so much care of himself, as to prepare his way by a Letter of his own, bearing date <hi>Iuly</hi> 29. In which Letter he first laid open the state of his case, desiring that by his Majesties Power he might be absolutely freed from those who had neither any Authority over his person, as being one of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Servants; nor over his Book, as being commanded by his Father, and authorized by himself. Which being said, he makes this resolute declaration,
<q>That if he could not really and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answer whatsoever was or could be imputed to him in any of his Books, he would no further desire favour and protection of his Majesty, or his Grace, but willingly would be left unto the power of his Enemies.</q>
Which Letter being sent before to prepare the way, this of the said three Bishops followed within four daies after.</p>

We are not strangers to his person, but it is the Cause which we are bound to be tender of. The cause we conceive (under correction of better Iudgment) concerns the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> nearly; for that Church, when it was reformed from the supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious opinions broached or maintained by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> refused
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54785:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the apparent and dangerous Errors, and would not be too busie with every particular School-Point. The Cause why she held this mederation was, because she could not be able to preserve any unity among Christians, if men were forced to subscribe to curious particulars disputed in Schools. Now may it please your Grace, the opinions which at this time trouble many men in the late Book of Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> are some of them such as are expresly the resolved Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and those he is bound to maintain. Some of them are such as are fit only for Schools, and to be left at more liberty for learned men to <hi>abound in their own sense,</hi> so they keep themselves peaceable, and distract not the Church. And therefore to make any Man subscribe to School-opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may justly seem hard in the Church of Christ, and was one great fault of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> And to affright them from those opinions in which they have (as they are bound) subscribed to the Church, as it is worse in it self, so may it be the Mother of greater danger.</p>
                        <p>May it please your Grace farther to consider, That when the Clergie submitted themselves in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, the submission was so made, that if any difference Doctrinal or other fell in the Church, the King and the Bishops were to be Iudges of it in the National <hi>Synod</hi> or Conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>y other Iudge, neither indeed can she though she would. And we humbly desire your Grace to consider, and then to move his most Gracious Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty (if you shall think fit) what dangerous consequences may follow up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>n it; For first if any other Iudge be allowed in matter of Doctrine we shall depart from the Ordinance of Christ, and the continual Course and Practice of the Church. Secondly, If the Church be once brought down beneath her self, we cannot but fear what may be the next stroke at it. Thirdly, It will some way touch the honour of his Majesties dear Father, and our most Dread Soveraign of glorious and ever blessed memory, King <hi>James,</hi> who saw and approved all the opinions of this Book: And he in his rare Wisdom and Iudgment would never have allowed them if they had crossed with truth and the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Fourthly, We must be bold to say, that we cannot conceive what use there can be of Civil Government in the Commonwealth, or of Preaching or External Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry in the Church, if such fatall opinions, as some which are opposite and contrary to these delivered by Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> are, shall be publikely taught and maintained, Fifthly, We are certain that all or most of the contrary opinions were treated of at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and ready to be published, but then Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memory, upon notice given, how little they agreed with the Practice of Piety, and obedience to all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, caused them to be suppressed; and so they have continued ever since, till of late some of them have received countenance at the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort.</hi> Now this was a Synod of that Nation, and can be of no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in any other National Church, till it be received there by publick Authority. And our hope is, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> will be well advised, and more than once over, before she admit a foraign <hi>Synod,</hi>
                           <pb n="138" facs="tcp:54785:72"/>

We fear he may receive discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and (which is far worse) we have some cause to doubt this may breed a great backwardness in able men to write in defence of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> against either home or foraign Adversaries, if they shall see him sink in Fortunes Reputation, or health, upon occasion of his Book.

Rising, which followed within five days after, but Vote their humble Thanks to be returned unto his Majesty, for giving such a Gracious Answer to their said Petition. This they had reason to expect from his Majesties Piety; but then they had another Game which must be followed, before the Kings Business could be heard. In the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Parliaments they had flesh'd themselves, by removing <hi>Bacon</hi> from the <hi>Seal,</hi> and <hi>Cranfeild</hi> from the <hi>Treasury</hi>: And somewhat must be done this Parliament also, for fear of hazarding such a <hi>Priviledge</hi> by a <hi>discontinuance. Williams</hi> came first into their eye, whom they looked on as a man not only improper for the Place, but also as not having carried himself in it with such integrity as he should have done; and him the Lawyers had most mind to, that they might get that Office once again into their possession. This <hi>Williams</hi> fearing, so applied himself to some leading Members, that he diverted them from himself to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> as a more noble Prey, and fitter for such <hi>mighty Hunters</hi> than a <hi>silly Priest.</hi> Nor was this Overture proposed to such as were either deaf or tongue-tied; for this great Game was no sooner started, but they followed it with such an Out-cry, that the noise thereof came presently to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties ears; who finding by these delays and artifices, that there was no hope of gaining the Supplies desired, on the 12th. of the same <hi>August</hi> dissolved the Parliament. He may now see the error he had run into by his breach with <hi>Spain,</hi> which put him into a necessity of making War, and that necessity compell'd him to cast himself in a manner on the Alms of his People, and to stand wholly in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at their Devotion.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament being thus dissolved, his Majesty progresseth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>West,</hi> to set forward his Navy, and <hi>Laud</hi> betakes himself unto his Diocess, this being the year of his <hi>Triennial Visitation.</hi> He took along with him in this Journey such Plate and Furniture as he had provided for his new Chappel at <hi>Aberguilly,</hi> which he Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated on <hi>Sunday August</hi> 28. Here he continued, by reason that the Sickness was hot in <hi>London,</hi> and not cooled in <hi>Oxon.</hi> till he was fain to make his way back again through Ice and Snow, as he writes in his Letters to the Duke from <hi>Windsor, December</hi> 13. At his return he found no small alteration in the Court. The Lord Keeper <hi>Williams</hi> stood upon no good terms with the Duke in the life of King <hi>Iames</hi>; but he declined more and more in Favour after his decease. The Duke had notice of his practising against him in the last Parliament, and was resolved to do his errand so effectually to the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that he should hold the Seal no longer; and he prevailed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in so far, that Sir <hi>Iohn Suckling,</hi> Controller of His Majesties Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, was sent to him (being then at a House of the Lord <hi>Sandys</hi>'s in the Parish of <hi>Bray</hi> neer <hi>Windsor</hi>) to require him to deliver up the Seal to his Majesties use; which being very unwillingly done, the Custody of the Great Seal, on <hi>Sunday</hi> the second of <hi>October,</hi> was committed to Sir <hi>Thomas Coventry</hi> his Majesties Atturney General,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54785:73"/>
whom <hi>Heath</hi> succeeded in that place. But my Lord was not gone, though the Keeper was: He still remained Lord Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and Dean of <hi>Westminster,</hi> holding still both his other Dignities and Preferments before recited: So that he might have lived as plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as the greatest, and as contentedly as the best, had he not thought that the fall was greater from the top of the Stairs unto the second or third Step, than from the second or third to the lowest of all. But as he sell, so <hi>Laud</hi> ascended: <hi>Neil</hi> his good Friend, then <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> had fallen sick in the beginning of the Spring, at whose request he was appointed to wait upon his Majesty as Clerk of the Closet; in which Service though he continued not long, yet he made such use of it, that from that time forwards he grew as much into the Kings Favour, as before he had been in the Dukes; becoming as it were his Majesties Secretary for all Church Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty having set forward his Navy (which setting out so late, could not be like to make any good Return) was not unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Promise he had made in Parliament, in answer to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the Lords and Commons, concerning the great dangers threatned to the Church and State by the <hi>Growth of Popery</hi>; to which end he caused a Commission to be issued under the Great Seal, for executing the Laws against Recusants, which he commanded to be published in all the Courts of Justice at <hi>Reading</hi> (to which Town the Term was then removed) that all his Judges and other Ministers of Justice might take notice of it, <hi>as also that all his Loving Subjects might be certified of his Princely Care and Charge for the Advancement of true Religion, and Suppression of Popery and Superstition</hi>: Which done, he directed his <note n="(a)" place="margin">

<q>That no good means be neglected on their part for discovering, finding out, and apprehending of Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its and Seminary Priests, and other Seducers of his People to the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion; or for repressing <hi>Popish</hi> Recusants, and Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of that sort, against whom they were to proceed by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and other Censures of the Church, not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any other Lawful means to bring them forth to publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</q>
But then withal his Majesty takes notice of another Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which threatned as much danger to the Church as the <hi>Papists</hi> did: And thereupon he further requireth the said two Archbishops,
<q>That a vigilant care be taken with the rest of the Clergy, for the repressing of those who being ill affected to the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here established, they keep more close and secret their ill and dangerous affections that way, and as well by their example, as by secret and under-hand sleights and means, do much encourage and encrease the growth of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Superstition</hi> in sundry parts of this Kingdom. And therefore he did not only require, that none of them might have any manner of Covert, Protection,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54785:73"/>
Countenance, or connivence from them, or any of the rest, as they tendred his Royal Commandment in that behalf: but that all possible diligence be used, as well to unmask the false shadows and pretences of those who may possibly be won to Conformity; letting all men know, That he could not think well of any that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Place and Authority in the Church, do permit such persons to pass with impunity; much less if they give them any counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to the emboldening them or their adherents.</q>

                     <hi>Abbot</hi> transmits the Copies of them to his several <hi>Suffragans,</hi> and to our Bishop of St. <hi>Davids</hi> amongst the rest, requiring him to conform therein to his Majesties Pleasure, and to see the same executed in all parts of his Diocess. On the receipt whereof, the Bishop commands his <hi>Chancellor, Arch-Deacons,</hi> and other Ecclesiastical Officers within his Diocess of St. <hi>Davids.</hi>
                     <q>That all possible care be taken of such as are any way backward in Points of Religion, and more especially of known and professed Recusants, that they may be carefully presented, and Proceedings had against them to Excommunication, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to form and order of Law; and that there be a true List and Catalogue of all such as have been presented and proceeded against, sent to him yearly after <hi>Easter,</hi> by him to be presented to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as had been required.</q>
No Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given unto his Chancellor, and other Officers, to look into the Practises and Proceedings of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction; for which I am able to give no reason, but that he had received no such Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Command from Archbishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> whose Letter pointed him no further (it is no hard matter to say why) than to the search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, presenting, and Excommunicating the <hi>Popish</hi> Recusants. And in what he commanded, he was obeyed by his Chancellor, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to him in <hi>Iune</hi> following the names of such Recusants as lived within the Counties of <hi>Caermarthen</hi> and <hi>Pembroke,</hi> the chief parts of his Diocess.</p>
                  <p>The Kings Coronation now draws on, for which Solemnity he had appointed the Feast of the <hi>Purification</hi> of the Blessed Virgin, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known by the name of <hi>Candlemas day.</hi> The Coronations of King <hi>Edward</hi> vi. and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> had been performed according to the Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Roman Pontificals;</hi> That at the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of King <hi>Iames</hi> had been drawn in haste, and wanted many things which might have been considered of in a time of leasure. His Majesty therefore issueth a Commission to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and certain other Bishops, whereof <hi>Laud</hi> was one, to consider of the Form and Order of the Coronation, and to acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the same more punctually to the present Rules and Orders of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> On the fourth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners first met to consult about it; and having compared t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e Form observed in the Coronation of King <hi>Iames,</hi> with the publick <hi>Rituals,</hi> it was agreed upon amongst them to make some Alterations
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54785:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in it, and Additions to it. The Alteration in it was, that the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was to be performed <hi>in forma Crucis,</hi> after the manner of a Cross, which was accordingly done by <hi>Abbot</hi> when he officiated as Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in the Coronation. The Additions in the Form consisted chiefly in one Prayer or Request to him in the behalf of the Clergy, and the clause of another Prayer for him to Almighty God; the last of which was thought to have ascribed too much Power to the King, the first to themselves, especially by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Bishops and Clergy above the <hi>Laity.</hi> The Prayer or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest which was made to him, followed after the <hi>Vnction,</hi> and was this, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Clause of that Prayer which was made for him, had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted since the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> vi. and was this that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth; <hi>viz.</hi>

Which Clause had been omitted in times of <hi>Popery,</hi> as intimating more Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction to be given to our Kings, than the <hi>Popes</hi> allowed of; and for the same reason was now quarrell'd at by the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction.</p>
                  <p>It was objected commonly in the time of his fall, That in digesting the form of the Coronation, he altered the Coronation Oath, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it more advantageous to the King, and less beneficial to the People than it had been formerly; from which calumny his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty cleared both himself and the Bishop, when they were both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved by common Speech in the guilt thereof. For the clearer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of which truth, I will first set down the Oath it self, as it was taken by the King; and then the Kings Defence for his taking of it. Now the Oath is this.</p>

This put him into some dispute within himself. He had no mind to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate <hi>Laud,</hi> being then one of the Prebendaries of that Church, because he lookt upon him as his Corrival and Supplanter in the Dukes good Grace; and to have named ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er of a lower order, there being a Bishop in the number, would have subjected him to some discourse and misconstruction; He therefore very wisely sent unto his Majesty the names, degrees, and dignities of all the Prebends, leaving it unto him alone to make the Election; who thereupon without any Hesitancy or deliberation deputed <hi>Laud</hi> unto the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. <hi>Laud,</hi> being thus nominated and deputed, prepared all things ready for that great Solemnity. And finding the <hi>Old Crucifix</hi> among the <hi>Regalia,</hi> he caused it to be placed on the Altar, as in former times. The Coronation being ended, his Majesty going in his Robes to <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall, did there deliver them to <hi>Laud</hi> (representing in that Pomp the Dean of <hi>Westminster</hi>) together with the Crown, Scepter, and the Sword called <hi>Cortena,</hi> to be laid up with the rest of the <hi>Regalia</hi> in their old repository; which he receiving from the King, returned into the Abbey Church, offered solemnly on the Altar in his Majesties name (as by his place he was to do) and so laid them up.</p>
                  <p>Two things there were remarkable in this Coronation, which seemed to have something in them of Presage. <hi>Senhouse,</hi> who had been once his Chaplain, when Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and was now Bishop of <hi>Carlile,</hi> had the honour to preach upon the day of that great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity. An eloquent man he was reputed, and one that could very well express a passion: but he had chosen such a Text, as was more proper for a Funeral than a Coronation; his Text being this, <hi>viz. I will give thee a Crown of life, Apoc.</hi> 2.10. and was rather thought
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54785:75"/>
to put the new King in mind of his Death than his duty in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and to have been his Funeral Sermon when he was alive, as if he were to have none when he was to be buried. It was observed also, that his Majesty on that day was cloathed in <hi>White,</hi> contrary to the Custom of his Predecessors, who were on that day clad in <hi>Purple.</hi> And this he did not out of any necessity, for want of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Velvet, enough to make a Suite, (for he had many yards of it in his outward Garment) but at his own choice only, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that Virgin Purity with which he came to be espoused unto his Kingdom. <hi>White</hi> (as we know) is the colour of the Saints, who are represented to us in <hi>White Robes</hi> by St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi>; and <hi>Purple</hi> is the Imperial and Regal colour, so proper heretofore unto Kings and Emperours, that many of the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours were called <hi>Porphyrogenites,</hi> because at their first coming into the world they were wrapt in <hi>Purple.</hi> And this some looked on also as an ill Presage, that the King laying aside his <hi>Purple,</hi> the Robe of Majesty, should cloath himself in <hi>White,</hi> the Robe of <hi>innocence</hi>; as if thereby it were fore-signified, that he should devest himself of that Regal Majesty which might and would have kept him safe from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front and scorn, to rely wholly on the innocence of a vertuous life, which did expose him finally to calamitous ruine.</p>
                  <p>No sooner were the Pomps of the Coronation ended, but the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Parliament began; at the opening whereof, on <hi>Munday</hi> the sixt of <hi>February,</hi> our Bishop of St. <hi>Davids</hi> preacht before his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, the Lords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Abbey Church. He was appointed to have preached in the beginning of the former Parliament, on <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the eighteenth of <hi>Iune</hi>; but that turn being otherwise supplied, he preached the same Sermon the next day before his Majesty at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> his Text then, <hi>Psal.</hi> 75.2, 3. <hi>When I shall receive the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, I will judge according unto right,</hi> &amp;c. But now he chose for the Theam or Subject of his discourse the 3, 4, 5 verses of the 112 <hi>Psalm,</hi> viz. <hi>Ierusalem is like a City that is at unity in it self,</hi> &amp;c. In which, considering <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as a Type of the Church and State, he first beholds it as a type of the State, or Civil Government. Where he considered
<q>That <hi>Ordo Politicus,</hi> the wise ordering of the people in <hi>Concord</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> was simply the strongest Wall of a State: But break <hi>Vnity</hi> once, and farewell all strength.

But I pray what is the difference for men not to meet in counsel, and to fall to pieces when they meet? If the first were our Fore-fathers errour, God of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy grant this second be not ours. And for the Church, that is as the City too, just so, <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> are the Walls and the Towers of it:<note place="margin">P. 107.</note> But be the one never so true, and the other never so perfect, they come both short of Preservation, if that body be not at <hi>unity</hi> in it self. The Church, take it Catholick, cannot stand well, if it be not compacted together into an holy <hi>unity</hi> with Faith and Charity. And as the whole Church is in regard of the affairs of Christendom, so is each particular Church in the Nation and Kingdom in which it sojourns. If it be not at <hi>unity</hi> in it self, it doth but invite Malice, which is ready to do hurt without any invitation: and it ever lies with an open side to the devil and all his batteries. So both Church and State, then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and never till then, when they are at unity within themselves, and one with another. Well, both State and Church owe much to <hi>Vnity</hi>; and therefore very little to them that break the peace of either. <hi>Father forgive them they know not what they do.</hi> But if <hi>unity</hi> be so necessary, how may it be preserved in both? How? I will tell you. Would you keep the State in <hi>Vnity</hi>? In any case take heed of breaking the peace of the Church. The peace of the State depends much upon it; For divide Christ in the minds of men,<note place="margin">P. 109.</note> or divide the minds of men about their hopes of Salvation in Christ, and tell me what <hi>unity</hi> there will be. Let this suffice so far as the Church is an ingredient into the unity of the State. But what other things are concurring to the unity of it, the State it self knows better than I can teach.</q>

                  <p>This was good <hi>Doctrine</hi> out of doubt. The Preacher had done his part in it, but the hearers did not; the Parliament not making such <hi>use</hi> of it as they should have done. At such time as the former Parliament was adjourned to <hi>Oxon,</hi> the Divinity School was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the House of Commons, and a Chair made for the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in or near the place, in which his Majesties Professor for Divinity did usually read his publick Lectures, and moderate in all publick Disputations. And this first put them into conceit, that the determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all Points and Controversies in Religion did belong to them. As <hi>Vibius Rufus</hi> in the Story, having married <hi>Tullies</hi> Widow, and bought <hi>Caesars</hi> Chair, conceived that he was then in a way to gain the Eloquence of the one, and the power of the other. For after that we find no Parliament without a Committee for Religion, and no Committee for Religion but what did think it self sufficiently instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to manage the greatest Controversies of Divinity which were brought before them: And so it was particularly with the present Parliament. The Commons had scarce setled themselves in their
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54785:76"/>
own House, but <hi>Mountague</hi> must be called to a new account for the <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arminianism</hi> affirmed to have been maintained by him in his books. In which Books if he had defended any thing contrary to the established Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, of the two, was the fitter Judge. And certainly it might have hapned ill unto him, the King not being willing to engage too far in those Emergences, (as the case then stood) if the Commons had not been diverted in pursuit of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>; which being a more noble game, they laid this aside, having done nothing in it but raised a great desire in several Members of both Houses to give themselves some satisfaction in those doubtful Points. To which end a Conference was procured by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> to be held at <hi>York</hi> House, between <hi>Buckeridge</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> and <hi>White</hi> Dean of <hi>Carlile,</hi> on the one side: <hi>Morton</hi> then of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> and <hi>Preston</hi> then of <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi> (of whom more hereafter) on the other; The Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> many other Lords, and many other persons of inferiour quality being present at it. To this Conference, which was holden on the eleventh of this <hi>February,</hi> another was added the next week on the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth. In which <hi>Mountague</hi> acted his own part in the place of <hi>Buckeridge,</hi> the Concourse being as great, both for the quality and number of the persons, as had been at the former. And the success was equal also. The Friends and Fautors of each side giving the victory to those (as commonly it happens in such cases) whose cause they favoured.</p>
                  <p>After this we hear no more of <hi>Mountague,</hi> but the passing of some Votes against him in the <hi>April</hi> following; which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eats being over, he was kept cold till the following Parliament: And then he shall be called for. In the mean time the King perceiving that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons had took no notice of his own occasions, gave order to Sir <hi>Richard Weston</hi> (then <hi>Chancellour</hi> of his <hi>Exchequer</hi>) to mind them of it; by whom he represented to them the return of the last years Fleet, and the want of Money to satisfie the Mariners and Souldiers for their Arr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These Propositions being made, <hi>Clem. Coke</hi> a younger Son of Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> (who had successively been Chief Justice of either Bench) obstructs the Answer by this rash and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsome expression, <hi>That it was better to dye by a Forreign Enemy, than to be destroyed at home.</hi> Which general words were by one <hi>Turner,</hi> a Doctor of Physick, and then a Member of that House, restrained and applied more particularly to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi>

The Commons well remembred at what Point they were cut off in the former Parliament, and carefully watcht all advantages to resume it in this. They had begun a great clamour against him on the first of <hi>March,</hi> for staying a <hi>French Ship,</hi> called the St. <hi>Peter of Newhaven</hi>; and <hi>Turner</hi> now incites them to a higher distemper, by six Queries raised about him, that is to say,
<q>First, Whether the King had not lost the Regality of the Narrow Seas since the Duke became Admiral? Secondly, Whether his not going as Admirall in this last Fleet was not the cause of the ill success? Thirdly, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Kings Revenue hath not been impaired through his immense liberality? Fourthly, Whether he hath not ingrossed all Offices, and preferred his Kindred to unfit places? Fifthly, Whether he hath not made sale of places of Judicature? Sixthly, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Recusants</hi> have not dependance on his Mother and Father in Law?</q>

                     <note place="margin">1626.</note>For this days work <hi>Coke</hi> was severely reprehended by his Father, who could not be perswaded to look upon him for a long while after: But <hi>Turner,</hi> having none whom he stood in fear of, escaped not only without a private reprehension, but without any publick Censure. His Majesty thereupon complained by <hi>Weston</hi> to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, who were so far from censuring the offence, that they seemed rather willing to protect the Offendors. And yet this was not all the affront they had done him neither. For seeming well satisfied with his Majesties gracious Answer to their Petition against Recusants, which they received from him at <hi>Oxon</hi> in the former Parliament, they now resolved to see what execution had been done upon it. And to that end they appoint a Committee for Religion, and that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee substitutes a Sub-Committee; which Sub-Committee were impowered to search the Signet Office concerning such indulgencies as had been granted to the Papists since the end of that Parliament, and to examine the Letters of the Secretaries of State, leaving his Majesty nothing free from their discovery as to that particular: A point which never was presumed on in preceding times. And which seemed worst of all in the present conjuncture, they had voted him three Subsidies, and three fifteens, but voted them with such a clog that they should not pass into a Bill till their <hi>Grievances</hi> were both heard and answered. Which <hi>Grievances</hi> what they were both in weight and number, as it was not known unto themselves; so did his Majesty look upon it, not only as a thing dilatory in it self, but as a baffle put on him and his proceedings.</p>
                  <p>These indignities coming thus upon the neck of one another, he caused the Lords and Commons to come before him at <hi>White Hall, March</hi> 29. 1626. where first he signified unto them, by the mouth of the Lord Keeper, how sensible he was of those affronts which were put upon him, touching upon every one of them in particular, and aggravating each of them in their several kinds, letting them also know, <hi>That as he loved his people, so he regarded his honour; and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54785:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that if he were sensible of his Subjects Grievances, of his own he was sensible much more.</hi> The Keeper also had Command to tell them, in his Majesties Name, <hi>That the Duke had acted nothing of Publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, without his Majesties Special Warrant; That he had discharged his Trust with abundant both Care and Fidelity; That since his Return from</hi> Spain <hi>he had been sedulous in promoting the Service and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Commons House; And therefore, That it was his express Command, That they desist from such Vnparliamentary Proceedings, and resign the Reformation of what was amiss to his Majesties Care, Wisdom, and Iustice.</hi> Which Speech being ended, his Majesty saith as followeth: <hi>I must withal put you in mind of Times past; you may remember my Father, moved by your Counsel, and won by your Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, brake the Treaties: In these Perswasions I was your Instrument towards him; and I was glad to be instrumental in any thing which might please the whole Body of this Realm: Nor was there any in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er favour with you, than this man whom you so traduce. And now when you find me so sure intangled in War, as I have no honourable and safe Retreat, you make my Necessity your Priviledge, and set what rate you please upon your Supplies: A Practise not very obliging unto Kings. Mr.</hi> Coke <hi>told you,</hi> It was better to die by a Foreign Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, than to be destroyed at home. <hi>Indeed I think it more honourable for a King to be invaded and almost destroyed by a Foreign Enemy, than to be despised at home.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all this did not edifie with the House of Commons. So little were they moved with the Eloquence of the one, and the smart Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of the other, that both their own Members remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censured, and the Prosecution of the Duke was followed with more violence then before it was. But for all this his Majesty and the Duke might thank themselves. His Majesty had power in his own hands to have righted himself, according to the practice of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and others of his Majesties Royal Predecessors in the times foregoing. But by complaining in this manner to the House of Commons, he chose rather to follow the Example of King <hi>Iames,</hi> who in like manner had complained of one <hi>Piggot,</hi> for some sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words by him spoken in the House of Commons, <hi>Anno</hi> 1607. and with like success. He that divests himself of a natural and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Power to right the injuries which are done him, in hope to find redress from others (especially from such as are parcel guilty of the Wrong) may put up all his gettings in a Seamstress Thimble, and yet never fill it. All that which both Kings effected by it, was but the weakning of their own Power, and the increasing of the others, who had now put themselves upon this Resolution, not to suffer any one of their Members to be questioned, till themselves had considered of his Crimes. By which means they kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves close together, and emboldened one another to stand it out against the King to the very last. And of this <hi>Maxime,</hi> as they made use in this present Parliament, in the Case of <hi>Coke, Turner, Diggs,</hi>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:54785:78"/>
and <hi>Eliot</hi> (which 2 last had been imprisoned by the Kings Command) so was it more violently and pertinaciously insisted on in the Case of the Five Members, impeach'd of High Treason by the Kings Atturney <hi>Ianuary</hi> 14. 1641. the miserable effects whereof we finde two sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. And as for their prosecuting of the Duke, the Commons might very well pretend, that they had and should do nothing in it, for which as well his Majesty as the Duke himself, had not given en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. They had both joined together against <hi>Cranfeild</hi> the late Lord Treasurer, and to revenge themselves on him, had turned him over to the power and malice of his Enemies in the House of Commons. The Commons had served their turns on <hi>Cranfeild,</hi> and will now serve their own turns on the Duke himself, let the King do the best he could to preserve him from them. So unsafe a thing it is for Princes to deliver any of their Servants into the hands of their People, and putting a Power out of themselves, which they cannot call back again when it most concerns them.</p>
                  <p>At the same time the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> being charged with Treason by the Duke, exhibited against him certain Articles in the House of Peers, in which he accused him of the like Crime, in reference to his Actings in the <hi>Spanish</hi> business. This made good sport amongst the Commons for a time; but at last s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aring either the Weakness of <hi>Bristol</hi>'s Charge, or the insufficiency of his Proofs, they resolved to follow their own way; and to that end a large Impeachment was drawn up against him, and presented to the Lords on the eighth of <hi>May,</hi> managed by six of the ablest Lawyers in the House, that is to say, <hi>Glanvile, Herbert, Selden, Pym, Wansford,</hi> and <hi>Sherland</hi>; the Prologue made by Sir <hi>Dudly Diggs,</hi> and the Epilogue by Sir <hi>Iohn Eliot.</hi> The principal Branches of this Impeachment related to his engrossing of Offices, his buying the Places of Lord <hi>Admiral,</hi> and Lord <hi>Warden</hi> of the <hi>Cinque Ports</hi>; His not guarding the Seas; His stay of a Ship called the St. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Newhaven,</hi> and of the <hi>East-India</hi> Fleet; Lending his Majesties Ship called the <hi>Vantgard</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King, which the <hi>French</hi> King employed against <hi>Rochel</hi>; His selling of Honours and Offices; procuring Honours for his Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; His diminishing the Revenues of the Crown; and his apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Physick to King <hi>Iames</hi> in the time of his Sickness. To every one of these there was returned in Writing a particular Answer by the Duke himself:
<q>And then addressing his Discourse unto the Peers, he humbly referred it to their Judgment, how full of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and prejudice it was, to give too ready an ear, and too easie a belief unto a Report or Testimony without Oath, which are not of weight enough to condemn any. With like humility he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, how easie a thing it was for him in his younger years, and unexperienced, to fall into thousands of Errors, in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>se ten years wherein he had the honour to serve so great and so open-hearted a Sovereign Master. But still he hoped the fear of God, his since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the true Religion established in the Church of <hi>England</hi>
                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:54785:78"/>
(though accompanied with many weaknesses and imperfections, which he is not ashamed humbly and heartily to confess) his care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness not willingly to offend so good and gracious a Master, and his love and duty to his Country, had restrained and preserved him from running into any hainous misdemeanours and crimes.</q>
Which said, and having craved the benefit of two several Pardons, the one granted in the last Parliament of King <hi>Iames,</hi> the other at the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of King <hi>Charles,</hi> he added,
<q>That he could not chuse but hope so much in their Lordships Justice and Honour, that they would acquit him of and from those Misdemeanours, Offences, Misprisions, and Crimes wherewith he had bee charged; and for his own part, he both hoped and would daily pray, That for the future he might so watch over all his Actions, both publick and private, as not to give cause of just offence to any person.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of these Proceedings his Majesty was exceeding sensible: He saw himself wounded through the Dukes sides; That his Fathers Favours and his own were the greatest Crimes of which the Duke had been impeached; and, That their Regal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in bestowing Offices and Honours on whom they pleased, was not only questioned, but controlled. With which disturbances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very much perplex'd and troubled, he receives a Letter written to him from an unknown Person, in which he first met with a Recital of the several Interests and Affections which were united in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution against the Duke;<note place="margin">

And that not to exceed our own and Fathers Memory, in King <hi>Henry</hi> viii. his time, <hi>Wolseys</hi> exorbitant Power and Pride, and <hi>Cromwels</hi> contempt of the Nobility and the Laws, were not yet permitted to be discussed in Parliament, though they were most odious and grievous to all the Kingdom: And that <hi>Leicesters</hi> undeserved Favour and Faults, <hi>Hattons</hi> insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, and <hi>Releighs</hi> Insolencies, far exceed what yet hath been objected against the Duke; yet no Lawyer durst abet, nor any man else begin any Invectives against them in Parliament.</q>
And then he adds (some other Passages intervening)
<q>That it behoves his Majesty to uphold the Duke against them, who if he be but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courted, it will be the Corner stone on which the demolishing of his Monarchy will be builded: For if they prevail with this, they have hatched a thousand other Demands to pull the Feathers of the Royalty; they will appoint him Counsellors, Servants, Alliances, Limits of his Expences, Accounts of his Revenue; chiefly, if they can (as they mainly desire) they will now dazle

him in the beginning of his Reign.</q>
How true a Prophet this man proved, the event hath shewed, and the King saw it well enough; and therefore since he could not divert them from that pursuit, on the 15th of <hi>Iune</hi> he dissolved the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>I have been the more punctual and particular in relating these Proceedings of the Commons against the Duke, by reason of that Influence which <hi>Laud</hi> either had, or is reported to have had, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging his Cause against them.<note place="margin">

Secondly, That he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise penned the Kings Speech to the House of Peers, touching the Duke, and the Commitment of the Earl of <hi>Arundel, May</hi> the 11th. In which he spake concerning the preservation of the Honour of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, against the vile and detestable Calumnies of those of the Lower House, by whom the Duke had been accused, as before was said. Most grievous Crimes indeed, if they had been true; for a Subject to assist his Prince, and a Servant to be aiding to his Master, in penning a short Speech or two, when either the pressure of Affairs, or perplexities of minde might require it of him. But for the truth of this there is no proof offered, but that the Copies of both Speeches (the <hi>Original Copies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pa. 8.</note> as he calls them) were found in the Archbishops Study, as probably they might have been in the Studies of many other men, if they had been searched; For who can ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally suppose, That his Majesty, who was the Master of such a pure and elegant Style, as he declared himself to be in his Discourse with <hi>Henderson</hi> at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and his Divine <hi>Essays</hi> made in Prison, when he could have no other helps but what he found in himself, should stand in need of the Expressions of another man in matters of so great concernment? Or if it be to be supposed, it makes exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to the honour and commendation of this our Bishop, as well in point of Secrecy as unfeigned Fidelity, that his Majesty should pick out him from all other men, to be his Pen-man or Chief Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in such weighty businesses. Then again, it is affirmed, That he not only corrected and amended the Dukes Answer to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment which was made against him by the Commons, but that he also penned that Speech which the Duke subjoined unto his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. A Crime of the same nature, and proved by the same <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi> as the others was; and such as rather might have served for a strong assurance both of his honest Fidelity to his Friend and Patron, and the even temper of his own mind in the managing of it. For if we may believe the Author of the first History of the Life and Reign of King <hi>Charles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hist. King <hi>Charles,</hi> p. 50.</note> as I think we may, this Answer of the Duke was so in-laid with Modesty and Humility, that it became a new Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to his Adversaries, and was like to have a powerful influence toward the conversion of many, who expected a Defence of another and more disdainful Spirit.</p>

That on <hi>Sunday, April</hi> 22. of this present year, his Majesty had commanded all the Bishops to come before him, and reprehended such as came (being fourteen in number) for being silent in Causes which concerned the Church, and had not made known unto him what might be profitable or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable for it, the Cause whereof he was so ready to promote. But then we are to call to mind, that <hi>Laud</hi> not long since had been sent by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to consult with <hi>Andrews,</hi> and learn of him what he thought fitting to be done in the Cause of the Church, and more especially in the Five Articles, so hotly agitated between the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> and <hi>Contra-Remonstrants</hi> in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. And it appears by the event, That <hi>Andrews</hi> did not hold it fit for any thing to be done in that particular, as the case then stood; the truth in those Opinions not being so generally entertained amongst the Clergy, nor the Archbishop and the greater part of the Prelates so inclinable to them, as to venture the determining of those Points to a <hi>Convocation.</hi>

                  <p>And now being fallen upon these men, it may not be amiss to say something of them in this place, considering how much they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised the patience of the Church and State in the Times succeeding. <hi>Burton</hi> had been a Servant in the Closet to his Sacred Majesty when he was Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>; and being once in the <hi>Ascendent,</hi> presumed that he should <hi>culminate</hi> before his time.

the Office of <hi>Clerk of the Closet</hi> at such time as Bishop <hi>Neil</hi> was sick, and he be looked on no otherwise than as an underling still. Vexed with that Indignity, as he then conceived it, he puts a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Paper into the hands of the King, for which, and for some other Insolencies and factious carriage, he was commanded by him to depart the Court; into which being never able to set foot again, he breathed nothing but rage and malice against his Majesty, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and all that were in place above him, and so continued till the last; it being the custom of all those whom the Court <hi>casts out,</hi> to labour by all means they can to <hi>out-cast</hi> the Court. <hi>Prynne</hi> lived sometimes a Commoner of <hi>Oriall</hi> Colledge, and afterwards entred himself a Student in <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> where he became a great follower of <hi>Preston,</hi> then the Lecturer there: Some parts of Learning he brought with him, which afterwards he improved by continual Study; and being found to be of an enterprising nature, hot-spirited, and eager in pursuit of any thing which was put into him, he was looked upon by <hi>Preston</hi> as the fittest person to venture upon such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, which a more sober and considerate man durst not have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in. Being once put into the road, it was not possible to get him out of it again by threats or punishments; till growing weary of himself, when he had no Enemy in a manner to encounter with, he began to look up at the last, and setled on more moderate and quiet courses, becoming in the end a happy Instrument of Peace both to Church and State. And now I am fallen on <hi>Preston</hi> also, I shall add something of him too, as being a man which made much noise in the World about this time.

Much was he cried up by his Followers in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, City, and all places else, as if he might have chosen his own <hi>Mitre,</hi> and had been as likely a man as any to have been trusted with the Great Seal in the place of <hi>Williams</hi>: but he was not principled for the Court, nor the Court for him; For long he had not been in that School of Policy, but he found other men as wise and cunning as himself, and that he could not govern there with such an absolute <hi>Omni-regency,</hi> as he had done in the Families of private Gentlemen in most parts of the Kingdom. Nor was it long before the Duke began to have some suspicion of him, as one not to be trusted in his Majesties Service, when it seemed any way to cross with the <hi>Puritan</hi> Interest, which he drove on with so much openness in the Court, as was not proper for a man of so famed a cunning. But that which
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54785:81"/>
lost him at the last, was a Letter by him written to a great Peer of the Realm, in which he spake disadvantageously enough, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully of the Court; and signified withal how little hope there was of doing any good in that place, for the advancement of the Cause. Which Letter, or a Copy of it, being unluckily dropp'd out of his Pocket, was taken up, and forthwith carried to the Duke: The shame and grief of which mischance, gave him so much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he withdrew by little and little, and at last betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self wholly to his old affectation of a Popular Greatness. By reason of his Lectures in <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> he was grown pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful in the University, and had gained a strong Party in the City, but died about the time that <hi>Laud</hi> succeeded <hi>Mountain</hi> in the See of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> And it was well for him that he died so opportunely; <hi>Laud</hi> was resolved that there should be no more but one Bishop of that City, and would have found some way or other to remove him out of <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> to the end he might have no pretence of raising or encreasing any Faction there, to disturbe the Publick. But before <hi>Laud</hi> shall come from St. <hi>Davids</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> he must take <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> in his way, to which we are now ready to wait upon him.</p>

And now he is actually possessed not only of the Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but of the Rents, Profits, and Emergencies belonging to a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi>; a double Title, but relating to a single Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocess, and that Diocess confined to the County of <hi>Somerset.</hi> The
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54785:83"/>
Bishops seat originally at <hi>Wells,</hi> where it still continues, and in respect whereof this Church is called in some Writers, <hi>Fontanensis Ecclesia.</hi> The stile of <hi>Bath</hi> came in but upon the by. The church of <hi>Wells</hi> first built by <hi>Ina</hi> King of the <hi>West Saxons, Anno</hi> 704. and by him dedicated to St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> after endowed by <hi>Kenulfe</hi> another King of the same people, <hi>Anno</hi> 766. and finally made a Bishops See in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the elder, <hi>Anno</hi> 905. The first that bore that title be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Adelmus,</hi> before Abbot of <hi>Glastenbury.</hi> The present Church, in place where that of <hi>Ina</hi> had stood before, was built most part of it by Bishop <hi>Robert,</hi> the eighteenth Bishop of this See, but finished and perfected by Bishop <hi>Ioceline</hi> Sirnamed <hi>d' Wellis. Iohannes d' Villula,</hi> the sixteenth Bishop, having bought the Town of <hi>Bath</hi> of King <hi>Henry</hi> the First for five hundred Marks, transferred his Seat unto that City 1088. Hence grew a jar betwixt the Monks of <hi>Bath</hi> and the Canons of <hi>Wells</hi> about the Election of the Bishop. At last the difference was thus composed by that Bishop <hi>Robert,</hi> whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I spake of, that from thenceforward the Bishop should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated from both places, and the precedency in the Style should be given to <hi>Bath</hi>; that on the vacancy of the See, a certain number of Delegates from both Churches should elect their <hi>Prelate,</hi> who being elected should be installed in them both; both of them to be reckoned as the Bishops Chapter, and all his Grants and Patents confirmed in both. And so it stood untill the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. at what time the Monastery of <hi>Bath</hi> being dissolved, there pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed an Act of Parliament for the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Wells</hi> to make one sole <hi>Chapter</hi> to the Bishop, 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>C.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>To welcome him to this new honour his Majesty commanded him to draw up certain <hi>Instructions</hi> to be communicated to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, Bishops, and the rest of the Clergy of this Realm upon this occasion. The late Parliament being dissolved without acting any thing in order to his Majesties Service, he was necessitated by the urgency of his affairs to try his Fortune on the subject in the way of <hi>Loane,</hi> which seemed to have some Regality in it; For whereas the Parliament had passed a Bill of three Subsidies and three fifteens, and that the said Parliament was dissolved before the Bill passed into an Act, his Majesty was advised that he had good grounds to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire those Subsidies of the Subjects which the House of Commons in their names had assented to, and yet not to require them by the name of Subsidies, but only in the way of <hi>Loan,</hi> till the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should enable him to make payment of it, or confirm his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying of those moneys by a subsequent Act. The Sum required to be raised was 173411 pound, which was conceived to equal the three Subsidies, which had been voted for him in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, though it never passed into an Act: or otherwise to make up that Sum which the present necessity of setting out his Fleet requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. He had before pawned the Plate and Jewels of the Crown, and sold as much Land to the City of <hi>London,</hi> (which would neither
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54785:83"/>
lent <hi>gratis,</hi> nor take those Lands in way of <hi>Mortgage</hi>) as brought in 120000 pound upon easie purchases. All which he was ready to expend, or had before expended on the publick safety. But that not being able to make such necessary provisions as were required, both to secure himself at home, and succour his Confederates and Allies abroad, he was forced to fall upon this course. To which end he issues out his Letters of <hi>Commission,</hi> bearing date the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>October,</hi> directed to certain Lords, Knights, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in their several Counties. In which they were required to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the People, that his dear Uncle the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was brought into great distress; That without present Succour the <hi>Sound</hi> would be lost, his Garrison in <hi>Stoade</hi> broken by the Emperours Forces, (which then straightly besieged it;) the <hi>Eastland</hi> Trade (which maintains our Shipping) and the Staple of <hi>Hamborough</hi> (which vents our Cloth) would both be gotten from him; As also that the two great Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> together with the Pope, were joyned to rout out our Religion; That their Admirals, the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and <hi>Don Frederick d' Toledo,</hi> were at that present before <hi>Rochel,</hi> endeavouring to block it up; And that they have store of Land-men ready on the Coast of <hi>Britain,</hi> with them and other Forces to invade us. Upon which grounds they were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by all plausible and powerful means to perswade the People to pay the Taxes severally imposed upon them; with many other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections tending to advance the Service.</p>
                  <p>It was observed of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that when she had any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness to bring about amongst the people, she used to <hi>tune the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,</hi> as her saying was; that is to say, to have some Preachers in and about <hi>London,</hi> and other great Auditories in the Kingdom, ready at command to cry up her design, as well in their publick Sermons as their private Conferences: Which course was now thought fit to be followed in preparing the people toward a dutifull compliance to these his Majesties desires.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Breviate.</hi>
                     </note> And to that end <hi>Laud</hi> received a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from his Majesty by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> to reduce cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain instructions into Form, partly <hi>Political,</hi> partly <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> in the Cause of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> not long before beaten, and now much distressed by Count <hi>Tilly,</hi> to be published in all Parishes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Realm. To this he chearfully conformed, and brought the said Instructions to the Duke within two daies after, being the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>September.</hi> And having read them over first to the Duke, and after to the King himself, he received from both a very favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acceptation. On the next day they were communicated to the Lords of the Council, who approved them also. By whose advice he sent them to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> requiring him by his Letters, bearing date <hi>September</hi> 29. to see them published and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed in the several Diocesses of his Province. The like Letters he also writ to the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi>; And they accordingly gave order to their several and respective <hi>Suffragans,</hi>
                     <q>To see them made
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54785:84"/>
known to the worthy Preachers and Ministers in their Diocess, and so far as their Lordships might in their own persons, to put these things in execution, and to call upon the Clergy which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, in their Preachings and private Conferences to stir up all sorts of people to express their Zeal to God, their Duty to the King, and their Love unto their Country, and one to another; that all good and Christian-like course might be taken for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of true Religion both in this Land, and through all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom.</q>
Now the tenour of the said <hi>Instructions</hi> was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>Most Reverend Father in God, right trusty and right well-beloved Counsellour, We greet you well.</head>
                        <p>WE have observed that the Church and the State are so nearly united and knit together, that though they may seem two bodies, yet indeed in some relation they may be accounted but as one, inasmuch as they both are made up of the same men, which are differenced only in relation to Spiritual or Civil ends. This neerness makes the Church call in the help of the State, to succour and support her, whensoever she is pressed beyond her strength: And the same nearness makes the State call in for the service of the Church, both to teach that duty which her Members know not, and to exhort them to, and encourage them in that duty which they know. It is not long since we ordered the State to serve the Church, and by a timely Proclamation settled the peace of it: And now the State looks for the like assistance from the Church, that she and all her Ministers may serve God and us, by preaching peace and unity at home, that it may be the better able to resist Forraign Force uniting and multiplying against it. And to the end that they to whom we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Government of the Church under us, may be the better able to dispose of the present occasions, we have, with the Advice of our Council, thought fit to send unto you these Instructions following, to be sent by you to the Bishops of your Province, and such others whom it may concern, and by them and all their Officers directed to all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters throughout the several Diocesses, that according to these punctually they may instruct and exhort the people to serve God and us, and labour by their Prayers to divert the dangers which hang over us. The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in which we are at this time is great. It is encreased by the late blow given our good Vncle the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who is the chief Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in those parts that opposed the spreading Forces of <hi>Spain.</hi> If he cannot subsist, there is little or nothing left to hinder the House of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi> from being Lord and Master of <hi>Germany:</hi> And that is a large and mighty Territory, and such as should it be gotten, would make an open way for <hi>Spain</hi> to do what they pleased in all the West part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom. For besides the great strength which <hi>Germany</hi> once possessed would bring to them, which are two strong already, you are to consider first how it enables them by Land, in that it will joyn all or the most part
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54785:84"/>
of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> now distracted Territories, and be a means for him safely and speedily to draw down Forces against any other Kingdom that shall stand in his way. Nor can it be thought the Low Countries can hold out longer against him if he once become Lord of the upper parts. And secondly, You are to weigh how it will advantage him by Sea, and make him strong against us in our particular, which is of easie apprehension to all men. And besides, if he once get <hi>Germany</hi> he will be able, though he had no Gold from <hi>India,</hi> to supply the necessity of those Wars, and to hinder all Trade and Traffick of the greatest Staple Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Kingdom, Cloth and Wool, and so make them of little or no value.</p>
                        <p>You are to know therefore that to prevent this, is the present care of the King and State, and there is no probable way left but by sending Forces and other Supplies to the said King of <hi>Denmark</hi> our dear Vncle, to enable him to keep the Field, that our Enemies be not Masters of all on the sudden. You are further to take notice how both we and the whole State stand bound in Honour and Conscience to supply the present necessity of the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> For this quarrel is more nearly ours, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Ancient Inheritance of our dear Sister and her Children. The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> stands not so near in bloud unto her as we do: Yet for her and our sakes that brave and valiant King hath adventured into the field, and in that ingagement hath not only hazarded his Person, but, as things go now, it may turn to some danger to his own Kingdom, and Posterity, should he not receive aide and succour from us without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay: Which should it happen (as God forbid) will be one of the greatest dishonours that ever this Kingdom was stained withall. Nor is danger and dishonour all the mischief that is like to follow this disaster; For if it be not presently relieved, the Cause of Religion is not only likely to suffer by it in some one part (as it hath already in a fearful manner in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate</hi>) but in all places where it hath gotten any footing. So that if we supply not presently our Allies and Confederates in this case, it is like to prove the extirpation of true Religion, and the re-planting of <hi>Romish</hi> Superstition in all the neighbouring parts of Christendom. And the coldness of this State shall suffer in all places as the betrayer of that Religion elsewhere, which it professeth and honoureth at home, which will be an imputation never to be washed off. And God forbid this State should suffer under it.</p>
                        <p>Neither may you forget rightly to inform the People committed to your charge, that this War which now grows full of danger was not entred upon rashly and without advice, but you are to acquaint them, that all former Treaties by a peaceable way were in the latter end of our dear Father of ever blessed memory dissolved as fruitless, and unfit to be longer held on foot; And this by the Counsel of both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then sitting: so those two great and honourable Bodies of Peers and People represented in Parliament led on this Counsel and course to a War with <hi>Spain.</hi> To effect this, they desired our aide and assistance, and used us to work our said dear Father to entertain this course. This upon their
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54785:85"/>
Perswasions, and Promises of all Assistance and Supply, we readily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook and effected, and cannot now be left in that Business, but with the Sin and Shame of all men. Sin, because Aid and Supply for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Kingdom, and the like Affairs of State, especially such as are advised and assumed by Parliamentary Council, are due to the King from his People, by all Law both of God and Men: And shame, if they forsake the King, while he pursues their own Council, just and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and which could not under God but have been as succesful, if it had been followed and supplied in time, as we desired and laboured for. One thing there is which proves a great hinderance of this State, and not continued among the People, without great offence against God, detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both to Church and State, and our great disservice in this and all other Business. It is breach of <hi>Unity,</hi> which is grown too great and common amongst all sorts of men. The danger of this goes far; for in all States it hath made way for Enemies to enter. We have by all means endeavoured Vnion, and require of you to Preach it, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the Mother of it, frequently in the ears of the People. We know their Loyal hearts, and therefore wonder the more what should cause de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted Affections. If you call upon them (which is your duty) we doubt not but that God will bless them with that Love to himself, to his Church, and their own Preservation, which alone will be able to bind up the scatterings of divided Affections into Strength. To this end you are to lay before them what Miseries Home-divisions have brought upon this and many other Kingdoms, and to exhort all men to embrace it in time. The Danger it self, besides all other Christian and Prudent Motives, is of force enough (where it is duly considered) to make men joyn in all amity against a common Enemy, a great and growing Enemy: And to do it in time, before any secret and cunning working of his may use one part in a division to weaken the other.</p>
                        <p>And in the last place (but first and last and all times to be insisted on) you are to call upon God your selves, and to incite the People to joyn with you in humble and hearty Prayers unto God, That he would be pleased now, after long affliction of his dear People and Children, to look in mercy both upon them and us, and in particular for the Safety of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and that Army which is left him, That God would bless and prosper him against his and our Enemies. Thus you are to strengthen the hearts and hopes of our Loyal Subjects and People, in and upon God. And whereas the greatest confidence men have in God, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not only from his Promises, but from their experience likewise of his Goodness, you must not fail often to recal to the memory of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with thankfulness, the late great Experience we have had of his Goodness towards us: For the three great and usual Iudgments, which he darts down upon disobedient and unthankful People, are <hi>Pestilence, Famine,</hi> and the <hi>Sword.</hi> The <hi>Pestilence</hi> did never rage more in this Kingdom than of late; and God was graciously pleased in mercy to hear the Prayers which were made unto him, and the ceasing of the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was little less than a Miracle. The <hi>Famine</hi> threatned us this
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54785:85"/>
present year; and it must have followed, had God rained down his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a little longer upon the Fruits of the Earth: But upon our Prayers he staied that Iudgment, and sent us a blessed Season, and a most plentiful Harvest. The <hi>Sword</hi> is the thing which we are now to look to; and you must call the People to their Prayers again, against that Enemy, That God will be pleased to send the like deliverance from this Iudgment also; That in the same Mercy he will vouchsafe to strengthen the hands of his People; That he will sharpen their Sword, but dull and turn the edge of that which is in our Enemies hands; that so while some Fight, others may Pray for the Blessing. And you are to be careful that you fail not to direct and hearten our Loving People in this and all other necessary Services, both of God, his Church, and Vs: That we may have the comfort of our Peoples Service; the State, Safety; the Church, Religion; and the People, the enjoying of all such Blessings as follow these. And we end with doubling this Care upon you, and all under you in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places.</p>

                  <p>Such were the <hi>Instructions</hi> issued by his Majesties Command, in the present exigent: The dexterous performance of which Service, as it raised <hi>Laud</hi> higher in his Majesties good Opinion of him, than before he was; so was it recompenced with a Place of greater neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to him, than before he had. For on that very day which gives date to the said <hi>Instructions,</hi> the most Learned and Reverend Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winton.</hi> and Dean of his Majesties Chappel-Royal, departed this Life at his <hi>Episcopal</hi> House in <hi>Southwark</hi>; whose Funerals were solemnized in St. <hi>Saviours</hi> Church on the eleventh day of <hi>November</hi> following, <hi>Buckeridge</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his last duty on him in a Funeral Sermon. A man he was of such extraordinary Abilities, that I shall rather chuse to express his Character by the Pen of others, than my own. Thus then says one of our late Historians:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hist. of K.</hi> Ch. <hi>by</hi> H. L. p 62.</note>
                     <q>This year we lost the stupendiously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Prelate Doctor <hi>Andrews</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> an excellent Disputant, in the Oriental Tongues surpassing knowing; so studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously devoted to the Doctrine of the Ancient Fathers, as his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Works breath nothing but their Faith; nor can we now read the Fathers, more than we should have done in his very Aspect, Gesture, and Actions; so venerable in his Presence, so grave in his Motions, so pious in his Conversation, so primitive in all.</q>
Another goes a little further, and tells us of him,
<q>That the World wanted Learning to know how Learned he was;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ch. Hist.</hi> B. 11. p. 126.</note> so skilled in all (especially Oriental Languages) that some conceive he might (if then living) almost have served as an <hi>Interpreter-General</hi> at the <hi>Confusion of Tongues.</hi>
                     </q>
In his life time he only published two Books in <hi>Latin, viz.</hi> His <hi>Apologie</hi> against Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54785:86"/>
that which he called <hi>Tortura Torti,</hi> in behalf of King <hi>Iames</hi>; and a small Tract entituled, <hi>Determinatio Theologica, de jure-jurando exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendo, quarto,</hi> Printed at <hi>London,</hi> 1593. And in <hi>English</hi> nothing but a small Volume of Sermons, which he acknowledged for his own. The Book of <hi>Catechetical Doctrine,</hi> published in his life by others, but without his privity and consent, he always professedly disavow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as containing only some imperfect Collections, which had been taken from his mouth by some ignorant hand, when he was Reader of the <hi>Catechism Lecture</hi> in <hi>Pembroke Hall.</hi> But after his decease, ninety six of his Sermons were collected with great care and industry, published in Print, and Dedicated to his Sacred Majesty by <hi>Laud</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Buckeridge</hi> at that time Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> 1628. For <hi>Felton</hi> of <hi>Ely</hi> dying the year before, <hi>Buckeridge</hi> had been translated thither by the Power and Favour of that his dear Friend and <hi>quondam</hi> Pupil, <hi>Curle</hi> Dean of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> and one of the <hi>Residentiaries</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi> succeeding after his Translation in the See of <hi>Rochester.</hi> By the same hands some other Pieces of his, both in <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> were very carefully drawn together, and published with the like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication to his Sacred Majesty, <hi>Anno</hi> 1629. He that desires to hear more of him, let him first consult the Funeral Sermon before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, extant at the end of the great Volume of his Sermons; and afterwards peruse his Epitaph in the Church of St. <hi>Maries Over-rhe,</hi> transcribed in <hi>Stows</hi> Survey of <hi>London</hi> of the last Edition. After his death the See of <hi>Winton</hi> was kept vacant till the latter end of the year next following; the profits of it being in the mean time taken up for his Majesties use, and answered into the Exchequer, according to an ancient Custom (but more old than commendable) used frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> since the time of <hi>William</hi> sirnamed <hi>Rufus,</hi> from whom it is said to have took beginning.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Deanry</hi> of the Chappel had not been void above nine days, when <hi>Laud</hi> was nominated to it, and was actually admitted into that Office on the sixth day of <hi>October</hi> following, by <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Montgomery</hi> Lord Chamberlain of his Majesties Houshold, before whom he took the usual and appointed Oath. He had before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served a Custom (as ill though not so old as the other) used in the Court since the first entrance of King <hi>Iames.</hi> The Custom was, That at what part soever of the Publick Prayers the King came into his Closet (which looked into the Chappel) to hear the Sermon, the Divine Service was cut off, and the Anthem sung, that the Preacher might go into the Pulpit. This the new Dean disliked, as he had good reason, and thereupon humbly moved his Majesty, that he would be present at the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> as well as the Sermon every Lords day; and that at whatsoever part of Prayers he came, the Priest who Ministred should proceed to the end of the Service: To which his Majesty most readily and religiously condescended, and gave him thanks for that his seasonable and pious Motion. As for the <hi>Deanry</hi> of the Chappel, it was of long standing in the Court, but had been
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54785:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
discontinued from the death of Dr. <hi>George Carew</hi> Dean of <hi>Windsor,</hi> (the Father of <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Carew</hi> of <hi>Clopton,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Totness</hi>) <hi>Anno</hi> 1572. till King <hi>Iames</hi> his coming to this Crown, at what time <hi>Bancroft,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> conceiving into what dangers the Church was like to run, by the multitude of <hi>Scots</hi> about him, thought it expedient that some Clergy-men of Note and Eminence should be attendant always in and about the Court. And thereupon it was advised, that to the Bishop <hi>Almoner</hi> and the Clerk of the Closet a Dean of the Chappel should be added, to look unto the diligent and due performance of Gods Publick Service, and order matters of the Quire.

                     <hi>and that the imposition of such Loans and Taxes did so far bind the Consciences of the Subjects of this Kingdom, that they could not refuse the payment of them without peril of eternal damnation.</hi> But neither the Doctrine of these Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, or of any other to that purpose, nor the distress of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> nor the miserable estate of <hi>Rochel,</hi> did so far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail amongst the people; but that the Commissioners for the Loane found greater opposition in it than they did expect. Many who had been Members in the two former Parliaments opposed it with their utmost power, and drew a great part of the Subjects, in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries some, to the like refusal. For which refusal some Lords, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54785:87"/>
many of the choice Gentry of the Kingdom, and others of inferiour sort were committed unto several Prisons, where they remained till the approach of the following Parliament. Insomuch that the Court was put upon the necessity of some further Project. The <hi>Papists</hi> would have raised a Provision for the setting forth both of Ships and Men, for the defence of the Narrow Seas, and working on the Kings wants, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered themselves with the hope of a Toleration for it. But old Sir <hi>Iohn Savill</hi> of <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> who had been lately taken into his Majesties Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, had found out a plot worth two of that; conceiving, that a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to proceed against Recusants for their thirds,<note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To this the King readily condescended, granting him and some others a Commission for that purpose for the Parts beyond <hi>Trent</hi>; as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to certain Lords and Gentlemen for all other Counties in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. By which means, and some moneys raised upon the <hi>Loane,</hi> there was such a present stock advanced, that with some other helps which his Majesty had, he was enabled to set forth a powerfull Fleet, and a considerable Land Army for the relief of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> whose quarrel he had undertaken upon this occasion.</p>
                  <p>The Queen at her first coming into <hi>England</hi> had brought with her a compl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the <hi>French</hi> Priests, and some of the rest of her Domesticks were grown so insolent, and had put so many affronts upon his Majesty, that he was forced to send them home within few daies after he had dissolved the foregoing Parliament. In which he had done no more than what the <hi>French</hi> King had done before him, in sending back all the <hi>Spanish</hi> Courtiers which his Queen brought with her. But the <hi>French</hi> King not looking on his own Example, and knowing on what ill terms the King stood both at home and abroad, first seized on all the Merchants Ships, which lay on the River of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and then brake out into open war. So that the King was necessitated to make use of those Forces against the <hi>French</hi> which were designed to have been used against the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and to comply with the desires of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> who humbly sued for his protection and defence. But the Fleet, not going out till after <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas,</hi> found greater opposition at Sea than they feared from the Land; being encountred with strong Tempests, and thereby neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated to return without doing any thing, but only shewing the Kings good will and readiness toward their assistance. But the next Fleet, and the Land-Army before mentioned, being in a readiness, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> appeared Commander general for that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, who hoped thereby to make himself of some consideration in the eyes of the People. On the twenty seventh of <hi>Iune</hi> he hoised Sailes for the Isle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> which lay before the Port of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and embarred their trade; the taking whereof was the matter aimed at: And he had strength enough both for Sea and Land to have done the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54785:87"/>
work, if he had not followed it more like a Courtier than a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier: For having neglected those advantages which the victory at his Landing gave him, he first suffered himself to be complemented out of the taking of their chief Fort, when it was almost at his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and after stood unseasonably upon point of Honour, in facing those Forces which were sent from the <hi>French</hi> King to raise the Siege, when he might have made a safe retreat unto his Ships without loss or danger. So that well beaten by the <hi>French,</hi> and with great loss of Reputation among the English, he came back with the remainder of his broken Forces in <hi>November</hi> following, as dearly welcom to the King as if he had returned with success and triumphs.</p>
                  <p>During the preparations for this unfortunate attempt, on <hi>Sunday</hi> the twenty ninth of <hi>April</hi> it pleased his Majesty to adm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So mutually did these two Prelates contribute their assistances to one another, that as <hi>Neile</hi> gave <hi>Laud</hi> his helping hand to bring him first into the Court, and plant him in King <hi>Iames</hi> his favour: So <hi>Laud</hi> made use of all advantages in behalf of <hi>Neile</hi> to keep him in favour with King <hi>Charles,</hi> and advance him higher. The Fleet and Forces before mentioned being in a readiness, and the Duke provided for the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aye, it was not thought either safe or fit that the Duke himself should be so long absent, without leaving some assured Friend about his Majesty by whom all practises against him might be either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented or suppressed, and by whose means the Kings affections might be alwaies inflamed towards him; To which end <hi>Laud</hi> is first desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to attend his Majesty to <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> before which the Navy lay at Anchor, and afterwards to wait the whole Progress also; the Inconveniencies of which journeys he was as willing to undergo as the Duke was willing to desire it.

demeanour, and very gracious with the people: one that chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as it seems) to give free way to all mens fancies, and suffer every mans proceedings, than draw upon himself the envy of a stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Clergy, and a factious Multitude. Never was Church more like to Church, Bishop to Bishop, time to time, (the names of the Sects and Heresies being only changed) than those of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> then, and of <hi>England</hi> now. A pregnant evidence, that possibly there could not be a greater mischief in a Church of God than a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Prelate.</p>
                  <p>This, though his Majesty might not know, yet the Bishops which were about him did, who therefore had but ill discharged their duty both to God and man, if they had not made his Majesty acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it; he could not chuse but see by the practises and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the former Parliaments to what a prevalency the Puritans were grown in all parts of the Kingdom; and how incompatible that humour was with the Regal interest. There was no need to tell him from what fountain the mischief came, how much the Popularity and remiss Government of <hi>Abbot</hi> did contribute towards it. Him therefore he sequestreth from his <hi>Metropolitical</hi> Jurisdiction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines him to his house at <hi>Ford</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and by his Commission, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing date the ninth day of <hi>October,</hi> 1627. transfers the exercise of that Jurisdiction to <hi>Mountaine</hi> Bishop of <hi>London, Neile</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Buckeridge</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester, Houson</hi> Bishop of <hi>Oxon,</hi> and <hi>Laud</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi>; To whom, or any two or more of them, he gives authority to execute and perform all and every those Acts, matters, and things, any way touching or concerning the Power, Jurisdiction, or Authority of the Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> in causes or matters Ecclesiastical, as amply, fully, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to all intents and purposes, as the said Archbishop himself might have done. And this his Majesty did to this end and purpose, that the <hi>Archiepiscopal</hi> Jurisdiction, being committed to such hands as were no favourers of that Faction, there might some stop be given to that violent current which then began to bear all before it. Nor did his Majesty fail of the end desired; For though <hi>Abbot</hi> (on good reasons of State) was restored unto his Jurisdiction toward the latter end of the year next following: Yet by this breathing time, as short as it was, the Church recovered strength again. And the disgrace put upon the man did so disanimate and deject the opposite Party, that the Ballance began visibly to turn on the Churches side.</p>
                  <p>During the time that this Commission was in force, some Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed persons in the Country, who in themselves were well affected to ancient orders, and now in more assurance of Protections than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> adventured on removing the Communion Table from the middle of the Church or Chancel, and setting it (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the pattern of the Mother Churches) where the Altar former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had stood. Amongst the rest one <hi>Titly,</hi> Vicar of <hi>Grantham</hi> (a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oted Town upon the Road) in the County of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> having
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54785:88"/>
observed the situation of the holy Table, as well in his <hi>Diocesans</hi> Chappel, as in the Cathedral mother Church, transposed the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the middest of the Chancel in his Parish Church, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it <hi>Altar-wise</hi> at the East end of it. Complaint hereof being made by some of that Town to the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> he presently takes hold of the opportunity to discourage the work; not because he disliked it in point of judgment (for then his judgment and his practice must have crost each other) but because <hi>Titly</hi> had Relation to the Bishop of <hi>Durham.</hi> And for the Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> he had no good thoughts, partly because he kept his stand in the Court, out of which himself had been ejected, and partly by reason of the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy betwixt him and <hi>Laud,</hi> whom he looked on as his open and professed enemy. And then how was it possible that he should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of <hi>Titly,</hi> or his action either, conceiving that it might be done by their or one of their appointments, or at the least in hope of better preferment from them? Hereupon he betakes himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Books, and frames a Popular Discourse against placing the Communion Table Altar-wise, digests it in the Form of a Letter to the Vicar of <hi>Grantham</hi>; but sends it unto some Divines of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture there, by them to be dispersed and scattered over all the Country. But of this Letter more hereafter, when we shall find it taken up for a Buckler against Authority, and laid in Bar against the proceedings of the Church and the Rules of it, when such transpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Table became more general, not alone practised, but prescribed. But the noise of this Letter not flying very far, at the first hindred not the removing of the Table in the Parish Church of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> in the Burrough of <hi>Abingdon</hi>; the occasion this: One <hi>Blucknall,</hi> dwelling in that Parish, bestowed upon it, amongst other Legacies, an annual Pension to be paid unto the Curate thereof, for reading duly prayer in the said Church according to the Form pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the <hi>English Liturgie.</hi> For the establishing of which Gifts and Legacies to the proper use and uses intended by him, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission was issued out of the High Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> according to the Statute 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Directed amongst others to Sir <hi>Ed. Clark</hi> Knight. <hi>Sam. Fell</hi> Doctor in Divinity, <hi>George Purefez,</hi> and <hi>Richard Organ</hi> Esquires; who by their joynt consent made this Order following: <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>And that the Table given by Mr. <hi>Blucknall</hi> should not by the multitude of People coming to Service, or otherwise by sitting or writing upon it, or by any other unreverent usage, be prophaned, spoyled, or hurt; We do order and decree, that the said Table shall continually stand at the upper end of the Chancell, upon which a Carpet (by him given) should be laid, where it shall continually stand close to the upper Skreen (there being of old with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Skreen a kind of Vestry for keeping the Plate, Books, and Vestments which belong to the Church) and there to be covered with the Carpet aforesaid, and in no place else.</q>
Which Order, together with many others, for settling and disposing the said Gifts
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54785:89"/>
and Legacies, were made at <hi>Abingdon</hi> on the twenty fifth of <hi>April,</hi> 1628. and afterwards confirmed under the Great Seal of <hi>England.</hi> This being the only Table, as I conceive, whose posture in that place is ratified by Decree in <hi>Chancery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as some private Beneficed persons, during the Suspension of the said Archbishop, did thus adventure on the one side; so divers <hi>Commissaries, Officials, Surrogates,</hi> and other Ecclesiastical Officers, began to carry a more hard hand on the <hi>Puritan</hi> Party (their great Friend and Patron being thus discountenanced) than they had done formerly. Amongst these none more active than <hi>Lamb, Sibthorp, Allen,</hi> and <hi>Burden,</hi> according to their Power and Places; the three last having some relation to <hi>Lamb,</hi> as <hi>Lamb</hi> had to the Episcopal Court at <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> and thereby a neer neighbourhood to the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> then keeping in his House at <hi>Buckden</hi> in the County of <hi>Huntingdon</hi>; at whose Table being entertained (as they had been many times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) they found there <hi>Morison</hi> Chancellor to that Bishop, and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geion</hi> one of the Officers of the Court at <hi>Lincoln.</hi>

The Bishop was conceived to live at too great a height, to be too popular withal, and thereby to promote the <hi>Puritan</hi> Interest, against the Counsels of the Court. This Information was laid hold on, as a means to humble him, to make him sensible of his own du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Kings displeasure; and a Command is given to <hi>Noy</hi> (then newly made his Majesties Atturney-General) to file a Bill, and prosecute against him in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> upon this delinquency. Though the Bishop about two or three years since had lost the Seal, yet he was thought to have taken the Purse along with him; reputed rich, and one that had good Friends in the Court about the King, which made him take the less regard of this prosecution. By the Advice of his Counsel he first demurred unto the Bill, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put in a strong Plea against it; both which were over-ruled by Chief Justice <hi>Richardson,</hi> to whom by Order of the Court they
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54785:89"/>
had been referred: Which artifices and delays, though they gained much time, yet could he not thereby take off the edge of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney, grown so much sharper toward him by those tricks in Law. And in this state we shall finde the business about ten years hence, when it came to a Sentence; having laid so much of it here together, because the occasion of the Suit was given much about this time.</p>
                  <p>About the same time also came out a Book entituled, <hi>A Collection of Private Devotions, or, the Hours of Prayer,</hi> composed by <hi>Cozens</hi> one of the <hi>Prebends</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> at the Request, and for the Satisfa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Next he objects, That the Book of <hi>Latin</hi> Prayers published by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> 1560. was called <hi>Orarium</hi> (not <hi>Horarium</hi>) <hi>sive Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellus Precationum</hi> (that is to say, <hi>A Book of Prayers</hi>): That in that Book there was mention of no other hours of Prayer than first, third, and ninth; and that in the second and third Editions of the same Book, published in the years 1564. and 1573. there occurred no such distribution into hours at all; which (said he) reproacheth all the Specifications before-remembred by the name of <hi>Popish</hi> trash and trumpery, stollen out of <hi>Popish</hi> Primers and Catechisms, not mentioned in any <hi>Protestant</hi> Writers; and then proceeds to the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasing of every Office, and the Prefaces belonging to them, which with the like infallible Spirit he condemns of <hi>Popery.</hi> But for all this violent opposition, and the great clamors made against it, the Book grew up into esteem, and justified it self, without any Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; insomuch that many of those who first startled at in regard of the Title, found in the body of it so much Piety, such regular Forms of Divine Worship, such necessary Consolations in special Exigencies, that they reserved it by them as a Jewel of great Price and value. But of this Author and his Book, the following Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to whom <hi>Prynne</hi> dedicates his Answer, will take further notice.</p>
                  <p>But before that Parliament begins, we must take notice of some Changes then in agitation amongst the Governours of the Church. His Majesty in the <hi>Iune</hi> foregoing had acquainted <hi>Laud</hi> with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of nominating him to the See of <hi>London</hi> in the place of <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> whom he looked on as a man unactive, and addicted to volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousness, and one that loved his ease too well to disturbe himself in the concerments of the Church. He also looked upon that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as the Retreat and Receptacle of the Grandees of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; the influence which it had, by reason of its Wealth and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, on all parts of the Kingdom; and that upon the Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Conformity thereof, the welfare of the whole depended: No better way to make them an example of Obedience to the rest of the Subjects, then by placing over them a Bishop of such Parts and Power as they should either be unable to withstand, or afraid to offend. In order unto this design, it was thought expedient to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate <hi>Neile</hi> (whose accommodations <hi>Laud</hi> much studied) to the See of <hi>Winchester,</hi> then vacant by the death of <hi>Andrews,</hi> and to remove <hi>Mountain</hi> unto <hi>Durham</hi> in the place of <hi>Neile</hi>: But the putting of this design into execution did require some time. Such Officers of State as had the management of the Kings Revenue, thought it not fit in that low ebb of the Exchequer, that the Church of <hi>Winton</hi> should be filled with another Bishop, before the <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Rents at least (if not some following Pay-days also) had flowed into his Majesties Coffers. Which though it were no very long time, compared with
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54785:90"/>
the Vacancies of some former Reign; yet gave it an occasion to some calumniating Spirits to report abroad, That this Bishoprick was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to be a Subsistence for one of the Queen of <hi>Bohemia's</hi> younger Sons, who was to hold it by the Name of an Administrator, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to an ill Custom of some Princes amongst the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> But this Obstruction being passed by, <hi>Neile</hi> with great chearfulness in himself, and thankfulness unto the King, proceeded in his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation to the See of <hi>Winton</hi>; his Election being ratified by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and confirmed in due form of Law, before the end of the next year, 1627. In <hi>Mountains</hi> hands the business did receive a stop: He had spent a great part of his Life in the air of the Court, as Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> Dean of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Almoner</hi>; and had lived for many years last past in the warm City of <hi>London.</hi> To remove him so far from the Court, and send him into those cold Regions of the <hi>North,</hi> he looked on as the worst kind of Banishment, next neighbour to a Civil death: But having a long while strived in vain, and understanding that his Majesty was not well pleased with his delays, he began to set forward on that Journey, with this <hi>Proviso</hi> notwithstanding, That the utmost term of his Removal should be but from <hi>London</hi>-House in the City, to <hi>Durham</hi>-House in the <hi>Strand.</hi> And yet to beget more delays toward <hi>Laud</hi>'s Advancement, before he actually was confirmed in the See of <hi>Durham,</hi> the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> See of <hi>York</hi> fell void by the death of the most Reverend Prelate Doctor <hi>Toby Matthews:</hi> This Dignity he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with as much ambition, as he had earnestly endeavoured to decline the other; and he obtained what he desired: But so much time was taken up in passing the Election, facilitating the Royal As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and the Formalities of his Confirmation, that the next Session of Parliament was ended, and the middle of <hi>Iuly</hi> well near passed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before <hi>Laud</hi> could be actually Translated to the See of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These matters being in agitation, and the Parliament drawing on apace, on <hi>Tuesday</hi> the fifth of <hi>February</hi> he strained the back-sinew of his right Leg, as he went with his Majesty to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> which kept him to his Chamber till the fourteenth of the same; during which time of his keeping in, I had both the happiness of being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into his special knowledge of me, and the opportunity of a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Conference with him than I could otherwise have expected. I went to have presented my service to him as he was preparing for this Journey, and was appointed to attend him on the same day seven-night, when I might presume on his return. Coming precisely at the time, I heard of his mischance, and that he kept himself to his Chamber; but order had been left amongst the Servants, that if I came he should be made acquainted with it; which being done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, I was brought into his Chamber, where I found him sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a Chair, with his lame leg resting on a Pillow. Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that no body should come to interrupt him till he called for them, he caused me to sit down by him, inquired first into the course
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54785:91"/>
of my Studies, which he well approved of, exhorting me to hold my self in that moderate course in which he found me. He fell af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to discourse of some passages in <hi>Oxon.</hi> in which I was spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerned, and told me thereupon the story of such oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as had been made against him in that University, by Archbishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> and some others; encouraged me not to shrink, if I had already, or should hereafter find the like. I was with him thus, <hi>remotis Arbitris,</hi> almost two hours: It grew towards twelve of the clock, and then he knocked for his Servants to come unto him. He dined that day in his ordinary Dining-room, which was the first time he had so done since his mishap. He caused me to tarry Dinner with him, and used me with no small respect, which was much noted by some Gentlemen (<hi>Ephilston,</hi> one of his Majesties Cup-bearers, being one of the Company) who dined that day with him. A passage, I confess, not pertinent to my present Story, but such as I have a good precedent for from <hi>Philip de Comines,</hi> who telleth us as impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the time (though he acquaint us not with the occasion) of his leaving the Duke of <hi>Burgundies</hi> Service, to betake himself to the Imployments of King <hi>Lewis</hi> xi.</p>
                  <p>It is now time to look into the following Parliament, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration whereunto (to make himself more gracious in the eyes of the People) his Majesty releaseth such Gentlemen as had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly imprisoned about the <hi>Loan</hi>; which in effect was but the letting loose of so many hungry Lions to pursue and worry him: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing looked upon as Confessors, if not Martyrs for the Common-wealth, upon the merit of those sufferings they were generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred afore all others to serve in Parliament; and being so preferred, they carried as generally with them a vindicative Spirit, to revenge themselves for that Restraint, by a restraining of the Prerogative within narrower bounds. At the opening of this Parliament, <hi>March</hi> 17. the Preaching of the Sermon was committed to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> who shewed much honest Art in perswading them to <hi>endeavour to keep the Vnity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace, Ephes.</hi> 4.3. which he had taken for his Text: In which, first laying before them the excellency and effects of <hi>VNITY,</hi> he told them, amongst other things,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Serm.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 247.</note>
                     <q>That it was a very charitable tie, but better <hi>known</hi> than <hi>loved</hi>; a thing so good, that it was never broken but by the worst men; nay, so good it was, that the very worst men pretended best when they broke it; and that it was so in the Church, neuer yet Heretick renting her Bowels, but he pretended that he raked them for Truth: That it was so also in the State, seldom any <hi>unquiet Spirit</hi> dividing her <hi>Vnion,</hi> but he pretends some <hi>great abuses,</hi> which his <hi>integrity</hi> would remedy: <hi>O that I were made a Iudge in the Land, that every man which hath any Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie might come to me, that I might do him Iustice</hi>: and yet no worse a man than <hi>David</hi> was King when this cunning was used, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. That <hi>Vnity</hi> both in Church and Common-wealth was
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54785:91"/>
so good, that none but the worst willingly broke it; That even they were so far ashamed of the breach, that they must seem holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the rest, that they may be thought to have had a just cause to break it. And afterwards coming by degrees to an Application, Good God (saith he) what a preposterous Thrift is this in men, to sow up every small rent in their own Coat, and not care what rents they not only suffer, but make in the Coat of Christ? What is it? Is Christ only thought fit to wear a torn Garment? Or can we think that the <hi>Spirit of Vnity,</hi> which is one with Christ, will not depart to seek warmer cloathing? Or if he be not gone already, why is there not <hi>Vnity,</hi> which is where ere he is? Or if he be but yet gone from other parts of <hi>Christendom,</hi> in any case (for the passion, and in the bowels of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> I beg it) let us make stay of him here in our parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
Which Sermon (being all of the same piece) so well pleased the Hearers, that his Majesty gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to have it Printed. How well it edified with the Commons, when they came to read it; and what thanks he received from them for it, we shall clearly see before we come to the end of this present Session.</p>
                  <p>The Sermon being ended, his Majesty set forwards to the House of Peers, where sitting in his Royal Throne, and causing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons then assembled to come before him, he signified in few words,
<q>That no man (as he conceived) could be so ignorant of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon necessity, as to expostulate the cause of this Meeting, and not to think Supply to be the end of it; That as this necessity was the product and consequent of their Advice (he means in reference to his first ingaging in the War with <hi>Spain</hi>) so the true Religion, the Laws and Liberties of this State, and just Defence of his Friends and Allies, being so considerably concerned, would be, he hoped, Arguments enough to perswade Supply; That he had taken the most ancient, speedy, and best way for Supply, by calling them together; in which if they should not do their duties, in answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the quality of his occasions, he must then take some other course for the saving of that, which the folly of some particular men might hazard to lose; That notwithstanding the distractions of the last Meeting, he came thither with no small confidence of good success; assuring them that he would forget and forgive whatsoever was past, and hoping that they would follow that sacred Advice lately inculcated, <hi>To maintain the VNITY of the Spirit in the bond of Peace.</hi>
                     </q>
Which being said, the Lord Keeper took his turn to speak, as the Custom is, in which Speech he chiefly laboured to lay before them the formidable Power of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> the mighty Preparations made by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Distractions at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the Dangers threatned by the <hi>French</hi> King to those of the Reformed Religion in his Dominions, and the necessity which lay upon the King to provide for the support thereof, as well as for the Peace and Preservation of his own Estate; concluding with
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54785:92"/>
severall reasons to invite them to assist his Majesty with a bountiful and quick supply according to the exigency of his affairs.</p>
                  <p>But all this, little edi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For so it happens commonly in all great Councils, that some few leading Members, either by their diligence or cunning, out-wit the rest, and form a party strong enough, by casting a mist before their eyes, or other subtle Artifices to effect their purpose. And so it fared in this last Parliament with the House of Commons, which though it contained amongst the rest as <hi>dutiful Subjects as any were in the world,</hi> (in his Majesties own acknowledgment of them) yet being governed by some men which had their interesses apart from the Crown, they are put upon a resolution of doing their own business first, and the Kings at leisure. And their own business it must be to secure the plots and practises of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction by turning all mens eyes upon such dangers as were to be feared from the Papists; and in the next place, to make such provision for themselves, that it should not be within the power of the Royal Prerogative to lay any restraint upon their persons.

                     </gap>ing of Popery, which they conceived to make the Wall of Separation betwixt God and them; to which they found their Lordships willing to consent, and his Majesty no less willing to satisfie them in all parts thereof than they could desire.<note place="margin">

                     <q>He told them he liked well of their beginning with Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hoped their Consultations would succeed the happier; That he was as careful of Religion, and should be as forward in it, as they could desire; That he liked well of the Petition, and would make use of those and all other means for the maintenance and propagation of that true Religion wherein he had lived, and by the grace of God was resolved to dye; And finally, That for the particulars, they should receive a more full answer hereafter (as they shortly did.) Which said, he put them in remembrance, That if Provisions were not speedily made, he should not be able to put a ship to sea this year.</q>
But though his Majesty gave so full and satisfactory an answer to every particular branch of the said Petition, that Sir <hi>Benjamin Ruddiard</hi> moved the House to tender their humble thanks to his Majesty for it; yet to the close of his Majesties Speech, touching the speedy making of provisions for that Summers Service, they returned no answer. They must first know whether they had any thing to give or not, whether they are to be accounted as Slaves or Freemen, to which two doubts the late imprisonment of their Members, for not paying the Loan required of them, gave them ground enough.</p>
                  <p>These weighty Questions being started, their own property and Liberty must first be setled, before they could be perswaded to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54785:92"/>
move a foot toward his Majesties supplies; Five Subsidies they had voted for him, but it passed no further than the Vote; For seeing that there was to be a trust on the one side or the other, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, that the honour of it should be theirs. The agitating of which Points, with those which depended thereupon, took up so much time, that before the Lords could be brought to joyn with the Commons, and both together could obtain their desires of the King, there was spent as far as to the seventh of <hi>Iune</hi>; and it was ten daies after before they had prepared the Bill of Subsidies for the Kings Assent.<note place="margin">His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Letter for the Lords, <hi>Bill. Reg.</hi> Sect. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>. N. 19.</note> Nothing in all this business did so trouble his Majesty as their insisting on this point: That in no case whatsoever, though it never so nearly concerned matters of State and Government, he of his Privy Council should have power to commit any man to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son without shewing the cause, and that cause to be allowed or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed as his Majesties Judges should think fit on the <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> of which his Majesty well observed in a Letter by him written to the Peers on the twelfth of <hi>May,</hi>
                     <q>That by shewing the cause of the Commitment, the whole Service many times might happen to be destroyed; and that the cause also might be such, and of a nature so transcending the Rules of Law, that the Judges had no capacity in a Court of Judicature to determine in it. The intermitting of which power, being one of the constant Rules of Government, practised for so many Ages within this Kingdom, would (as he said) soon dissolve the very frame and foundation of his Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and therefore that with out the overthrow of his Soveraignty he could not suffer these powers to be impeached.</q>
But what reason soever he had to alledge for himself, he was so bent on his desires to relieve the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> and keep that honour up abroad which he lost at home; that at the last he condescended unto their desires, and confirmed the prayer of their Petition by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p>Nor would they rest upon that point. They thought they had not done themselves <hi>right</hi> enough in disputing their <hi>Property</hi> with the King in Parliament if they suffered it to be preached down in the Court and Country. <hi>Manwaring</hi> therefore (of whose Sermons we have spake before) must be brought in for an example unto others. Whose charge, being drawn up by the Commons, was reported to the Peers by <hi>Pym Iune</hi> 13. The Book of his two Sermons produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before them, the passages which gave offence openly read, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated to the very height. And though the poor man, on his knees, with tears in his eyes, and sorrows in his heart, had most humbly craved pardon of the Lords and Commons for the errors and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions he had committed in the said two Sermons, yet could he find no other mercy than,
<q>1. To be imprisoned during the pleasure of the House. 2. To be fined one thousand pounds to the King. 3. To make such an acknowledgment of his offence at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Bar as it should please them to prescribe. 4. To be suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54785:93"/>
from his Ministry for three years to come. 5. To be disabled from ever preaching at the Court. 6. To be uncapable of any further. Ecclesiastical preferment, or secular Office. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, That his Majesty should be moved to call in the said Book by Proclamation, and cause it to be publickly burnt.</q>
An heavy Sentence I confess, but such as did rather affright than hurt him. For his Majesty looking on him in that conjuncture as one that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in his cause, preferred him first to the Parsonage of <hi>Stamford-Rivers</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> (void not long after by the promotion of <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> to the See of <hi>Chiches<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But they had a greater game to fly at, than to content themselves with so poor a Sacrifice. The day before, complaint was made unto the Commons, that <hi>Laud,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> had warranted those Sermons to the Press, and him they had as good a mind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And there had been some liftings at him in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try also, there being some mutterings spread abroad, that some Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices must be made for expiating the ill success in the Isle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> and that he was as like as any to be made the Sacrifice. Which comming to his ears from two several persons, he thought fit to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Majesty with it; who thereupon returned this most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious answer, <hi>That he should not trouble himself with such reports, till he saw him forsake his other friends.</hi> Had he stood still upon that principle he had never fallen. Such Princes as forsake their Servants, will be forsaken by their Servants in their greatest need, and neither be well served at home, nor observed abroad. But it appeared by the event, that those mutterings were not made without some ground, and that somewhat was then plotting toward his destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For <hi>Manwaring</hi> was no sooner censured, but <hi>Lauds</hi> cause was called to the report, some daies before (viz. <hi>Iune</hi> 11.) they had voted the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to be the cause of all the grievances; and now they were hammering a Remonstrance, both against him, and all that depended on him. In which Remonstrance, having first besprinkled the King with some Court <hi>holy-water,</hi> for granting their Petition of Right, they make bold to represent unto him,
<q>That there was a general fear conceived in his people of some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret working and combination to introduce into this Kingdom <hi>innovation</hi> and change of holy Religion. Which fear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded (as they said) from the encrease of <hi>Popery</hi> in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the extraordinary favours and respects which they of that Religion found in the Court from persons of great quality and
<pb facs="tcp:54785:93"/>
power there, unto whom they continually resort, more especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by name from the Countess of <hi>Buckingham</hi> the Dukes Mother. Secondly, From some Letters written by his Majesty to stop all legal proceedings against <hi>Recusants,</hi> and the Compositions which had been made with some of them for such fines and penalties as were laid upon them by the Laws, which seemed in their opinion little less than a Toleration. Thirdly, From the dayly growth and spreading of the Faction of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> that being (as they thought his Majesty knew) but a cunning way to bring in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi>; the professors of those opinions being common disturbers of the Protestant Churches, and Incendiaries of those states wherein they have gotten any head, being <hi>Protestants</hi> in shew, but <hi>Iesuites</hi> in opinion and practice. Of which growing Faction <hi>Neile</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and <hi>Laud</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> are named par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly for the principal Patrons. Fourthly, From some endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to suppress the diligent teaching and instructing the people in the true knowledge of Almighty God by disparaging pious, painful, and Orthodox Preachers. Fifthly, From the miserable condition of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which without controule the Popish Religion is affirmed to be openly professed, Popish Superstition being generally exercised and avowed, Monasteries, and Nunneries newly erected, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> In the last place they lay before him their former grievances, now redressed; the design of raising moneys by the way of Excise, and of bringing in some Regiments of <hi>German</hi> horse, though never put into execution; a Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Lieutenancy granted to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>; they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed decay of Trade in all parts of the Kingdom; the improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent consumption of the stock of Gunpowder; the loss of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of the Narrow Seas; the taking of many Merchants Ships by the Pyrates of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
The cause of all which mischiefs is imputed to the excessive power of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and his abusing of that power.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Remonstrance</hi> being thus digested, it was presented to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, together with the Bill of Subsidies, on the seventeenth of <hi>Iune.</hi>

<q>That on his Answer to their <hi>Petition</hi> of <hi>Right</hi> he expected no such Declaration from them, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth divers points of state touching the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that he conceived they did believe he understood them better than themselves: But that since the reading thereof, he perceived they understood those things less than he imagined; and that notwithstanding he would take them into such consideration as they deserved.</q>
Nor was it long after his Majesties receiving of this <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> but that they were drawing up another to take away his right to <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage.</hi> Which coming to his Majesties knowledge, he resolved to be beforehand with them, and dissolve the Parliament, which was done accordingly <hi>Iune</hi> 26. At the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54785:94"/>
whereof his Majesty gave this further censure on the said <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance, viz.</hi>
                     <q>That the acceptableness thereof unto him every man might judge, and that he would not call in question the merit of it, because he was sure no wise man could justifie it.</q>
And possibly it had escaped without any further censure, if the Commons for the ostentation of their Zeal and Piety had not caused it to be Printed, and dispersed abroad, with which his Majesty being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, he commanded it to be called in by Proclamation, as tending to the defamation of his Person and Government.</p>
                  <p>But no sooner was the Parliament ended, but he gave order unto <hi>Laud</hi> (whom he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound to be much concerned in it) to return an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thereunto; which he, who knew no better <hi>Sacrifice</hi> than obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, did very chearfully perform; which Answer for so much as concerns Religion, the Preamble and Conclusion being laid aside, we shall here subjoyn.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>And first <hi>(saith he)</hi> that <hi>Remonstrance</hi> begins at Religion, and fears of innovation in it; <hi>Innovation</hi> by Popery; but we would have our Subjects of all sorts to call to mind what difficulties and dangers we endured not many years since for Religions sake; That we are the same still, and our <hi>holy Religion</hi> is as pretious to us as it is or can be to any of them, and we will no more admit <hi>innovation</hi> therein than they that think they have done well in fearing it so much. It is true, that all effects expected have not followed upon the Petitions delivered at <hi>Oxon,</hi> but we are in least fault for that; for supply being not afforded us, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enabled us to execute all that was desired, and caused the stay of those legal proceedings which have helped to swell up this <hi>Remonstrance</hi>: Yet let all the Counties of <hi>England</hi> be examined, and <hi>London,</hi> with the Suburbs with them, neither is there such a noted increase of <hi>Papists,</hi> nor such cause of fear as is made; nor hath any amounted to such an odious tolerating, as is charged upon it, nor near any such. For that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> so much complained of, both the matter and intent of it are utterly mistaken; for it doth not dispence with any penalty, or any course to be taken with any <hi>Papists</hi> for the exercise of their Religion, no nor with the <hi>Pecuniary Mulets</hi> or <hi>non-conformity to ours;</hi> it was advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for the encrease of our profits, and the returning of that into our Purse, which abuse or connivency of inferiour Ministers might perhaps divert another way, if that or any other shall be abused in the execution, we will be ready to punish upon any just complaint. The next fear is the dayly growth and spreading of the <hi>Arminian Faction,</hi> called a cunning way to bring in Popery: but we hold this Charge as great a wrong, to our Self and Government, as the former; For our People must not be taught by a Parliament <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> or any other way, that we are so ignorant of Truth, or so careless of the profession of it; that any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or faction, or whatever it be called, should thrust it self so far, and so fast into our Kingdom without our knowledge of it: this is a meer dream of them that wake, and would make our loyal and loving
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54785:94"/>
People think we sleep the while. In this Charge there is great wrong done to two eminent Prelates that attend our Person; for they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, without producing any the least shew or shadow of Proof against them; and should they, or any other, attempt Innovation of Religion, either by that open or any cunning way, we should quickly take other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with them, and not stay for your Remonstrance.</p>
                     <p>To keep on this, our people are made believe, That there is a restraint of <hi>Books Orthodoxal</hi>: but we are sure since the late Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, some whom the <hi>Remonstrance</hi> calls <hi>Orthodox,</hi> have assumed unto themselves an unsufferable Liberty in Printing. Our Proclamation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Restraint on both sides, till the Passions of men might subside and calm; and had this been obeyed as it ought, we had not now been tossed in this Tempest: And for the distressing and discountenancing of Good Preachers, we know there is none, if they be (as they are called) <hi>Good.</hi> But our People shall never want that Spiritual Comfort which is due unto them; and for the Preferments which we bestow, we have so made it our great Care to give them, as Rewards of Desert and Pains; but as the Preferments are ours, so will we be judge of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert Our self, and not be taught by a <hi>Remonstrance.</hi> For <hi>Ireland,</hi> we think in case of <hi>Religion,</hi> it is not worse than Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> left it; and for other Affairs, it is as good as we found it, nay, perhaps better; and we take it as a great disparagement to our Government; that it should be voiced, That new Monasteries, Nunneries, and other Superstitious Houses, are Erected and Replenished in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and other great Towns of that our Kingdom: For we assure our self, our Deputy and Council there will not suffer God and our Government so to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, but we should have some account of it from them; and we may not endure to have our good People thus misled with Shews. There is likewise somewhat considerable, in the time when these Practises to undermine true Religion in our Kingdoms, are set on foot. The <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance</hi> tells us it is now, when Religion is opposed by open force in all Parts: But we must tell our People, There is no undermining Practice at home against it, if they practice not against it that seem most to labour for it; for while <hi>Religion</hi> seems to be contended for in such a Factious way, which cannot be Gods way, the heat of that doth often melt away the Purity which it labours earnestly (but perhaps not wisely) to preserve. And for Gods Iudgments, which we and our People have felt, and have cause to fear, we shall prevent them best by a true Religious <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance</hi> of the amendment of our Lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This, and the rest of the Answer to the said <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> is all what I find acted by <hi>Laud</hi> in reference to the present Parliament. For, That he should be a chief means for the dissolving of this, of a principal Instrument in the untimely breaking off of the former, I find no proof offered, though he stands charged with the one in the further Articles of his Impeachment, and of the other on the ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e suspicion of a private Person. As little proof I find of another
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54785:95"/>
Article, in which he stands accused for saying, <hi>That this Parliament was a Factious Parliament, and had cast many Scandals upon his Majesty, and had used him like a Child in his Minority; styling them</hi> PURI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANS, <hi>and commending the</hi> Papists <hi>for harmless and peaceable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>: For which, if any Evidence had been brought against him, he might have been condemned by some for his Indiscretion, but by none <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or Treason. Nor did the Parliament Act more against Church or Church-men, than what is formerly related? but only in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving certain Articles against one <hi>Burgess</hi> Vicar of <hi>Witney,</hi> in the County of <hi>Oxon.</hi> By which it did appear, That the man was sharp set against the <hi>Puritans,</hi> whom he accused of breaking every one of the Ten Commandments, reproach'd them with many bitter <hi>Exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations,</hi> and finally impeached <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> and all the Ministers of the Reformed Churches, both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting many Treasons against those Princes under whom they lived. But these Matters not being Actionable at the Common Law, nor punishable (as the times then were) in way of Parliamentary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; the poor man, after a long and chargeable Attendance, was at last dismissed. Little or nothing done in the <hi>Convocation</hi> which accompanied this Parliament, but the granting of five <hi>Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> toward the Support of his Majesties Royal Estate, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Kingdoms: So much the more acceptable to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, because the Grant seemed in a manner to exceed their Abilities, and came not clogged with any self-ends, or particular Interesses. Kings are Gods Deputies on Earth, and like him, love a <hi>chearful Giver,</hi> above all those who either do it <hi>grudgingly,</hi> or upon <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No sooner was the Parliament ended, but <hi>Laud</hi> prepares for his Translation to the See of <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Conge d' eslire</hi> being issued out on the first of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the Election within few days returned, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly confirmed with the accustomed Formalities on St. <hi>Swithin</hi>'s day, being the fifteenth of that Month. <hi>London,</hi> the Kings Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and the chief City of the Realm; equal in bigness unto any, but in Trade Superiour unto all in these Parts of <hi>Christendom</hi>; one of the Metropolitan Sees of the Ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> and next in Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Antiquity to the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> amongst the <hi>Saxons.</hi> The first Bishop of it, called <hi>Melitus,</hi> received his Episcopal Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Anno</hi> 606. from whom <hi>Laud</hi> was in number the 88th. as he had been the 89th. Bishop of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> another of the Metropolitan Sees of the <hi>Britains.</hi> The Cathedral Church, best known by the name of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> was founded first by <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> the first Christian King of <hi>Kent,</hi> and the six Monarchs of the <hi>Saxons</hi>; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards much beautified and enlarged by <hi>Erkenwald</hi> the fourth Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop: Which Church of theirs being 500 years after destroyed by fire, that which now stands was built in the place thereof by <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Richardus</hi> his Successor, and certain other of the Bishops, a great part of it at their own Charge, and the Residue by a general

Contribution over all the Kingdom.

As for the Diocess of <hi>London,</hi> it contains in it the whole Counties of <hi>Middlesex</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> so much of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-shire</hi> as was anciently possessed by the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi> together with the peculiar Jurisdiction of the Church of St. <hi>Albans</hi>; divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into 623 Parishes (of which 189 are Impropriations) and those distributed amongst five Archdeacons, that is to say, of <hi>London, Middlesex, Essex, Colchester,</hi> and the Archdeacon of St. <hi>Albans</hi> for that Circuit only.</p>
                  <p>His own Translation being past, his next Employment of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was his assisting at the Consecration of <hi>Mountague,</hi> nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Majesty to the See of <hi>Chichester</hi> in the place of <hi>Carleton,</hi> who died about the latter end of the Parliament; which Action in the King seemed more magnanimous than safe: For though there was much magnanimity in preferring the man, whom he beheld as well in his personal Sufferings, as his great Abilities; yet was it not held safe for him (as his case then stood) to give such matter of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperation to the House of Commons, of whom he did expect a Supplement to the former Subsidies within few Months after. Nor did the business pass so clearly on <hi>Mountagues</hi> side, but that he found a rub in his way, which was like to have hindred his Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the present time, but possibly enough for the times to come. It is an ancient Custom, that the Elections of all Bishops in the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> be solemnly confirmed by the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, or his Vicar-general, in the Court of the <hi>Arches,</hi> held in St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church in <hi>Cheapside,</hi> commonly called by the name of <hi>Bow</hi> Church; at and before which Confirmation, there is publick notice given to all manner of Persons, That if they have any thing to object either against the Party elected, or the legality of his Election, he should come and tender his Exceptions at the time appointed, or else for ever after to hold his peace: Which signification being made, as <hi>Mountague</hi> stood ready to be Confirmed, one <hi>Iones</hi> a Bookseller, accompanied with a Rabble of the poorer sort, excepted against him as a man unfit to be made a Bishop, charging him with <hi>Popery, Arminianism,</hi> and some other <hi>Heterodoxies,</hi> for which his Books had been condemned in the former Parliament. It hapned well that <hi>Brent</hi> the Vicar-general, either for disaffection to the man, or on some necessary avocation, had devolved his Office for that time on Doctor <hi>Thomas Reives</hi> his Majesties Advocate, a man of better Principles in himself, and of more Learning in the Laws than the other was: For no sooner had <hi>Iones</hi> offered his Exceptions against
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54785:96"/>
the Party Elected, but <hi>Reives</hi> had found a way to evade the danger, and frustrate the bold man of his design, for putting a present stop to the Confirmation; For neither were the Exceptions tendred in writing, signed by the hand of any Advocate, nor presented by any of the Proctors authorised to attend that Court; all which Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities were to have been observed by <hi>Iones</hi> in the present Act, but that the man was hurried on with more Zeal than Knowledg. Which Rub thus happily removed <hi>August</hi> 22. <hi>Mountague</hi> hastens all he could to his Consecration, which was performed on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 24th. at the Archbishops house in <hi>Croyden, Laud</hi> amongst other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops assisting at it.</p>
                  <p>And it is possible enough, That if he had not made such haste as he did, he might have had a worse rub in it than he had before. Scarce was the Consecration finished, when news came to <hi>Croyden</hi> of the unfortunate death of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> murthered the day before at <hi>Portsmouth</hi> by one <hi>Iohn Felton</hi> a Lieutenant, who thought himself neglected in the course of his Service. The Duke had wholly set his heart on the Relief of <hi>Rochel,</hi> then block'd up by the <hi>French</hi> both by Sea and Land, in hope thereby to redeem the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he had lost at the Isle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> and to ingratiate himself with the People of <hi>England.</hi> On the twelfth of <hi>August</hi> he set forwards from <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> neer which the Navy lay at Anchor, and where he had appointed the Rendezvouz for his Land-Forces to assemble and meet together. The interval of time betwixt that and his death he spent in putting all things into Readiness, that he was almost at the point of going on Board, when <hi>Feli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The wretch in such a general confusion might have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himself, if either curiosity in attending the issue, or some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation in his countenance upon the horror of the Fact, had not betrayed him to a present discovery. Taken upon suspicion, and questioned about the Murder, he made no scruple to avow it, as a meritorious Act, of which he had more cause to glory than to be ashamed: And being afterwards more cunningly handled by one of his Majesties Chaplains (sent to him from the Court of purpose to work him to it) he confessed plainly and resolvedly, That he had no other motive to commit that Murder, but the late <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> in which the Duke had been accused for being the Cause of all the Grievances and Mischiefs in the Common-wealth.

                  <p>It is not to be doubted but that his Majesty was much afflicted in the loss of so dear a Servant, in whose bosom he had lodged so much of his Counsels, and to whose Conduct he had so fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended the Great Concernments of the Kingdom. But such
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54785:96"/>
was the constancy of his Temper, and the known evenness of his Spirit, that in the middest of all those sorrows he neither neglected his Affairs abroad, nor his Friends at home: For notwithstanding this sad accident, the Fleet set forwards under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> whose coming within sight of <hi>Rochel</hi> was welcom'd by those in the Town with all the outward expressions of Hope and Joy: But his desires to do them Service were without Success: For when he came, he found the Haven so strongly barred, that though he gallantly attempted to force his way, and give Relief to the Besieged; yet find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but impossibility in the Undertaking, he discharged his Ordnance against the Enemy, and went off with safety: Which being perceived by those of the Town, who had placed their last hopes in this Attempt, they presently set open their Gates, casting themselves upon the Mercy of their Natural Prince, whose Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Authority they had for so many years before both opposed and sleighted. And on the other side, being well assured of that infinite anguish and disconsolation which <hi>Laud</hi> (his now most trusty Servant) must needs suffer under, by the most barbarous Assassinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of so dear a Friend, he dispatch'd <hi>Elphiston</hi> his Cup-bearer with a <hi>gracious</hi> Message to comfort him in those disquiets of his Soul; and on the neck of that, a Letter of his own hand-writing to the same effect. He looks upon him now as his Principal Minister, well pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised in the Course of his Business, of whose fidelity to his Person, and perspicacity of Judgment in Affairs of State, he had found such good proof: And therefore at the first time that <hi>Laud</hi> could find himself in a condition to attend upon him, he used many graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Speeches to him, not only to wipe off the Remembrance of that sad Misfortune, but to put him into such a Power by which he might be able to protect himself against all his Enemies. He was before but an inferiour Minister in the Ship of State, and had the trimming of the Sails, the super-inspection of the <hi>Bulgings</hi> and Leakings of it. Now he is called unto the Helm, and steers the Course thereof by his sage Directions.</p>
                  <p>Having obtained this heighth of Power, he casts his eye back on his Majesties Proclamation of the fourteenth of <hi>Iune, Anno</hi> 1626. Of which though he had made good use in suppressing some of those Books which seemed to foment the present Controversies; yet he soon found, as well by his own Observation, as by Intelligence from others, That no such general notice had been taken of it as was first expected: For being only published in Market-Towns (and perhaps very few of them) the <hi>Puritan</hi> Ministers in the Country did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themselves obliged to take notice of it. And much less could it come to the ears of Students in Universities, for whose restraint from medling, either by Preaching or Writing, in the Points pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, it might seem most necessary. He knew, that by the Laws of the Land all Ministers were to read the Book of Articles audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and distinctly, in the hearing of their Parishioners, when they
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54785:97"/>
first entred on their Cures; and that by the Canons of the Church, all that took Orders or Degrees were publickly to subscribe unto them. A Declaration to the same effect before those Articles must needs give such a general signification of his Majesties pleasure, that no body could from thenceforth pretend ignorance of it, which must needs render his transgression the more inexcusable. Upon which prudent considerations he moved his Majesty that the Book of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles might be reprinted; and such a Declaration placed before them as might preserve them from such misconstructions as had of late been put upon them, and keep them to their native literal and <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi> sense. His Majesty approved the Counsel as both pious and profitable, and presently gave order, that all things should be done according as he had advised. A Declaration of great influence in the course of our Story, and therefore here to be subjoyned in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place.</p>

                              <p>That We are Supreme Governour of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that if any difference arise about the External Policie, concerning <hi>Injunctions, Canons,</hi> or other Constitutions whatsoever, thereunto belonging; the Clergy in their Convocation is to order and settle them, having first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leave under Our Broad Seal so to do: And We approving their said Ordinances and Constitutions, providing that none be made contrary to the Laws and Customs of the Land. That out of Our Princely care that the Church-men may do the work which is proper unto them; the Bishops and Clergie, from time to time, in Convocation, upon their humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, shall have licence under Our Broad Seal, to deliberate of, and to do all such things, as being made plain by them, and assented by Vs, shall concern the settled continuance of the Doctrine and Discipline of the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54785:97"/>
Church of <hi>England</hi> established; from which We shall not endure any variation or departing in the least degree. That for the present, though some differences have been ill raised, We take comfort in this, that all Clergie-men within Our Realm have alwaies most willingly subscribed to the Articles established, which is an Argument to Vs, that they all agree in the true usual literal meaning of the said Articles, and that even in those curious Points, in which the present differences lye, men of all sorts take the Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be for them; which is an argument again, that none of them intend any desertion of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles established. That therefore in these both curious and unhappy differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which have for many hundred years, in different times and places, exercised the Church of Christ, We will that all further curious search be laid aside, and these disputes be shut up in Gods Promises, as they be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally set forth unto Vs in holy Scriptures; and the general meaning of the Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> according to them. And that no man hereafter shall either Print or Preach to draw the Article aside any way, but shall submit to it in the plain and full meaning thereof: And shall not put his own sense or Coment to be the meaning of the Article, but shall take it in the literal and Grammatical sense. That if any Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reader in either Our Vniversities, or any Head or Master of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or any other person respectively in either of them, shall affix any new sense to any Article, or shall publickly read, determine, or hold any publick Disputation, or suffer any such to be held either way, in either the Vniversities or Colledges respectively; or if any Divine in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities shall Preach or Print any thing either way, other than is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in Convocation with Our Royal Assent: He, or they, the Offenders, shall be liable to Our displeasure, and the Churches Censure in Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> as well as any other: and We will see there shall be due execution upon them.</p>

the Protestants from their <hi>Heresies,</hi> and that it begin to flourish and bear fruit already; That for the better preventing of the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, the <hi>Arminians</hi> had lockt up the Dukes ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with much of the like impudent stuff, which no sober man did otherwise look on than a piece of <hi>Gullery.</hi> Upon which grounds, a Petition was designed for his Sacred Majesty, by some of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Party in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi>
                     <q>For the revoking of the said De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, by which they were deterred (as the matter was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) from preaching the <hi>saving</hi> Doctrines of Gods <hi>Free Grace</hi> in <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Predestination</hi>:<note place="margin">

                        </note> And this (say they) had brought them into a very great straight; either or incurring Gods hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy displeasure, if they did not faithfully discharge their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage in declaring the <hi>whole Counsel</hi> of God; or the danger of being censured as violaters of his Majesties said Act, if they preacht those constant Doctrines of our Church, and confuted the opposite <hi>Pelagian</hi> and <hi>Arminian Heresies,</hi> both preached and Printed boldly without fear of censure. And thereupon they pray on their bended knees, that his gracious Majesty would take into his Princely consideration the forenamed Evils and Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under which they groaned, and, as a wise Physician, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe and apply such speedy Remedies as may both cure the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Maladies, and secure the peace of Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, from all those Plagues which their Neighbours had not a little felt, and more may fear if the Council of his Majesties Father to the States of the United Provinces were not better fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</q>

                  <p>But this Petition being stopt before it came to the King, they found more countenance from the Commons, in the next Parliamentary meeting, than they were like to have found at the hands of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.

                     <q>We the Commons now assembled in Parliament, do claim, profess, and avow for truth the sense of the Articles of Religion which were established in Parliament the thirteenth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which by the publick Acts of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the general and currant exposition of the Writers of our Church have been delivered to us, and we reject the sense of the <hi>Iesuites, Arminians,</hi> and all others wherein they differ from us.</q>
Which Declaration of the Commons, as it gave great animation to those of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Party, who entertained it with the like ardency of affection, as those of <hi>Ephesus</hi> did the Image of <hi>DIANA</hi> which fell down from heaven; so gave it great matter of discourse to most knowing men. The Points were intricate and weighty, such as in all Ages of the Church had exercised the wits of the greatest Scholars. Those which had taken on them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for truth that which they took to be the sense and meaning of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54785:98"/>
the Articles, in those intricate Points, were at the best no other than a company of Lay Persons, met together on another occasion; who, though they might probably be supposed for the wisest men, could not in reason be relied on as the greatest Clerks. And therefore it must needs be looked on as a kind of <hi>Prodigie,</hi> that men unqualified, and no way authorized for any such purpose, should take upon them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in such weighty matters, as were more proper for a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal or Provincial Council: But being it proceeded from the House of Commons, whose power began to grow more formidable every day than other, no body durst adventure a Reply unto it; till <hi>Laud</hi> himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which not being published at that time in Print (for ought I have either heard or seen) but found in the rifling of his Study amongst the rest of his Papers, I shall present unto the Reader in these following words:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <p>And first <hi>(saith he)</hi> the Publick Acts of the Church in matters of Doctrine are Canons and Acts of Councils,<note place="margin">Cant. Doom. <hi>p. 163.</hi>
                           </note> as well for expounding as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining; The Acts of the High Commission are not in this sense Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Acts of the Church, nor the meeting of a few or more Bishops <hi>Extra Concilium</hi> unless they be by lawful Authority called to that work, and their decision approved by the Church. Secondly, The currant Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Writers is a strong probable argument, <hi>De sensu Canonis Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae vel Articuli;</hi> yet but probable: The currant Exposition of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers themselves have sometimes missed <hi>Sensum Ecclesiae.</hi> Thirdly, Will you reject <hi>all</hi> sense of <hi>Jesuite</hi> or <hi>Arminian?</hi> May not some be true? May not some be agreeable to our Writers, and yet in a way that is stronger than ours to confirm the Article? Fourthly, Is there by this Act any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation made or declared of the Articles or not? If none, to what end the Act? If a sense or interpretation be declared, what Authority have Lay-men to make it? For interpretation of an Article belongs to them only that have power to make it. Fifthly, It is manifest there is a sense declared by the House of Commons, the Act saies it, (<hi>We avow the Article, and in that sense, and all other that agree not with us in the aforesaid sense, we reject</hi> (these, and these go about misinterpretation of a sense; <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is a Declaration of a sense; yea, but it is not a new sense declared by them, but they <hi>avow</hi> the old sense declared by the Church) <hi>the publick Authentick Acts of the Churc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>,</hi> &amp;c.) yea, but if there be no such publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Acts of the Church, then here is a <hi>sense</hi> of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared under the pretexts of it. Sixthly, It seems against the Kings Declaration, <hi>1.</hi> That say, We shall take the general meaning of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles: This Act restrains them to consent of Writers. <hi>2.</hi> That says, The Articles shall not be drawn aside any way, but that we shall take it in the literal and Grammatical sense: This Act ties us to consent of Writers, which may, and perhaps do, go against the literal sense; for here is no
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54785:99"/>
exception; so we shall be perplexed, and our consent required to things contrary. Seventhly, All consent in all Ages, as far as I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to an Article or Canon, is to it self as it is laid down in the body of it, and if it bear more senses then one, it is lawful for any man to chuse what sense his judgment directs him to, so that it be a sense <hi>secundum Analogiam fidei,</hi> and that he hold it peaceably without distracting the Church, and this till the Church that made the Article determine a sense: And the wisdom of the Church hath been in all Ages, or in most<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to require consent to Articles in General, as much as may be, because that is the way of unity; and the Church in high points requiring assent to particulars, hath been rent; as <hi>De Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>It is reported of <hi>Alphonso</hi> King of <hi>Castile,</hi> Sirnamed the <hi>Wise,</hi> that he used many times to say (never the worse for so saying) That if he had stood at God Almighties Elbow when he made the world, he would have put him in mind of some things which had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, or otherwise might have been better ordered than they were. And give me leave to say, with as little wisdom, (though with no such blasphemy) that if I had stood at his Lordships Elbow when he made these <hi>Scholia's,</hi> I would have put him in mind of returning an answer to that Clause of the said Declaration, in which it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, <hi>That the Articles of Religion were established in Parliament in the thirteenth of Queen</hi> Elizabeth. But I would fain know of them whether the Parliament they speak of, or any other since or before that time, did take upon them to confirm <hi>Articles</hi> of Religion, agreed on by the Clergy in their Convocations, or that they appointed any <hi>Committee for Religion</hi> to examine the Orthodoxie of those Articles, and make report unto the House. All which was done in that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was this, and on this occasion. Some Ministers of the Church so stifly wedded to their old <hi>Mumsimus</hi> of the Mass; and some as furiously prosecuting their new <hi>Sumpsimus</hi> of <hi>inconformity,</hi> it was thought fit that between those contending parties, the Doctrine of the Church should be kept inviolate. And thereupon it was Enacted, That every person under the degree of a Bishop, which did or should pretend to be a Priest or Minister of Gods holy Word and Sacraments in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> should before <hi>Christmass</hi> next following, in the presence of his Diocesan Bishop, testifie his assent and subscribe to the said Articles of the year 1562. Secondly, That after such subscribing before the Bishop, he should on some Sunday in the Forenoon in the Church or Chappel where he served, in time of Divine Service read openly the said Articles, on pain of being deprived of all his Ecclesiastical Promotions as if he were then naturally dead. Thirdly, That if any Ecclesiastical person should maintain any Doctrine contrary to any of the said Articles, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Convented before his Bishop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and should persist therein, it should be just cause to deprive such person of his Ecclesiastical
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54785:99"/>
Promotions. Fourthly, That all persons to be admitted to any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice with cure, should likewise subscribe to the said Articles, and publickly read the same in the open Church, within two months after their Induction, with declaration of their unseigned assent to the same, on the pain aforesaid. In all which there was nothing done to confirm these Articles, but only a pious care expressed for reformation of such disorders as were like to rise amongst the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Church by requiring their subscription and assent unto them under such temporal punishments, which at that time the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church had not laid upon them.</p>
                  <p>But it is time to leave these follies of my own, and return to our Bishop, who had thus seasonably manifested both his Zeal and Judgment in reference to the peace of the Church in general; nor shewed he less in reference to the peace of that Universitie, which had the happiness and honour of his Education. The Proctorship had be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ore been carried by a combination of some houses against the rest; the weaker side calling in strangers and non-residents to give voyces for them. For remedie whereof a Letter in another year was procured from the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> then Chancellour of that University, by which it was declared, that only such as were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Residents should be admitted to their Suffrages in the said Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; which Letter was protested against by the <hi>Proctors</hi> for the year 1627. as knowing how destructive it was of their plot and party: And on the other side, such Colledges as had many Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelries, and other places, which were removable at pleasure, invested many which came out of the Country in the said Offices and Places one after another, thereby admitting them for the time into actual residence. In which estate things stood when the great competition was, <hi>April</hi> 23. 1628. betwixt <hi>Williamson</hi> of <hi>Magdalens,</hi> and <hi>More</hi> of <hi>New-Colledge</hi> on the one side, and <hi>Bruch</hi> of <hi>Brazen-nose,</hi> with <hi>Lloyd</hi> of <hi>Iesus Colledge</hi> on the other side. These last pretending foul play to be offered to them (as indeed it was not very fair) made their appeal unto the King; before whom the proceedings being heard and examined, <hi>Williamson</hi> and <hi>Lloyd</hi> were returned <hi>Proctors</hi> for that year, the last pretending Kindred to the Dutchess of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> And to prevent the like disorders for the time to come, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by the King, with the Advice of his Council, but of <hi>Laud</hi> especially, that the <hi>Proctors</hi> should from thenceforth be chosen by their severall Colledges, each Colledge having more or fewer turns, according to the number and greatness of their Foundations. To which end a <hi>Cycle</hi> was devised, containing a perpetual Revolution of three and twenty years, within which Latitude of time, <hi>Christ-Church</hi> was to enjoy six Proctors, <hi>Magdalen</hi> five, <hi>New-Colledge</hi> foure, <hi>Merton, All-Souls, Exeter, Brazen-Nose,</hi> St. <hi>Iohns,</hi> and <hi>Wadham</hi> Colledges to have three a piece; <hi>Trinity, Queens, Orial,</hi> and <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> to have only two; the rest, that is to say, <hi>Vniversity, Baliol, Lincoln, Iesus,</hi> and <hi>Pembroke,</hi> but one alone; which <hi>Cycle</hi> was so
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54785:100"/>
contrived, that every Colledge knew their turn before it came, and did accordingly resolve on the fittest man to supply the place. And for the more peaceable ordering of such other matters in the University, as had relation thereunto, some Statutes were digested by <hi>Laud,</hi> and recommended by the King to the said University, where they were chearfully received, without contradiction, and Entred on Record in the Publick Registers in <hi>December</hi> following. Yet was not this the only good turn which that University recieved from him in this Year: For in the two Months next ensuing, he procured no fewer than 260 <hi>Greek Manuscripts</hi> to be given unto the Publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary; that is to say, 240 of them by the Munificence of the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and 20 by the Bounty of Sir <hi>Thomas Row,</hi> then newly returned from his Negotiations in the Eastern parts.</p>
                  <p>And now the time of the next Parliamentary Meeting, which by divers Adjournments had been put off till the twentieth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> was neer at hand. And that the Meeting might be more agreeable to his Intendments, his Majesty was advised to smooth and prepare his way unto it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> first by removing of some Rubs, and after by some popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Acts of Place and Favour. <hi>Savill</hi> of <hi>Yorshire,</hi> a busie man in the House of Commons, but otherwise a politick and prudent Person, he had taken off at the end of the former Parliament, by making him one of his Privy Council, and preferring him to be Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of his Houshold, in the place of <hi>Suckling</hi> then deceased; and at the end of the last Session had raised him to the honour of Lord <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> of <hi>Pontfract.</hi> Competitor with <hi>Savill</hi> in all his Elections for that County, had been Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> of <hi>Wentworth Woad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,</hi> a man of most prodigous Parts, which he had made use of at first in favour of the Popular Faction, and for refusing of the <hi>Loan</hi> had been long imprisoned. He looked on the Preferments of <hi>Savill</hi> (his old Adversary) with no small disdain, taking himself to be, as indeed he was, as much above him in Revenue, as in Parts and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. To sweeten and demulce this man, Sir <hi>Richard Weston</hi> then Lord Treasurer, created afterwards Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> used his best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; and having gained him to the King, not only procured him to be one of his Majesties Privy Council, but to be made Lord <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident</hi> of the <hi>North,</hi> and advanc'd unto the Title of <hi>Viscount Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>; by which he over-topped the <hi>Savills</hi> both in Court and Country. Being so gained unto the King, he became the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Friend of the Church, the greatest Zealot for advancing the <hi>Monarchical</hi> Interest, and the ablest Minister of State both for Peace and War, that any of our former Histories have afforded to us. He had not long frequented the Council-Table, when <hi>Laud</hi> and he, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a right understanding of one another, entred into a League of such inviolable Friendship, that nothing but the inevitable stroke of Death could part them; and joining hearts and hands together, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operated from thenceforth for advancing the Honour of the Church, and his Majesties Service.</p>

                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:54785:100"/>These Matters being carried thus, to assure himself of two such Persons, in which he very much pleased himself, his Majesty must do something also to please the People; and nothing was conceived could have pleased them more, than to grant them their desires in matters which concerned Religion, and bestow Favours upon such men as were dear unto them. In pursuance of his gracious Answer to the Lords and Commons, touching Priests and Jesuits, the growth of <hi>Popery,</hi> and obstinacy of Recusants, he had caused his Proclamation to be issued on the third of <hi>August,</hi> for putting the Laws and Statutes made against Jesuits, Priests, and Popish Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants, in due Execution: And now he adds another to it, dated on the eleventh day of <hi>December,</hi> for the Apprehension of <hi>Richard Smith</hi> a <hi>Popish Priest,</hi> styling and calling himself the Bishop of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> a dangerous man, and one who under colour of a Foreign Title, exercised all manner of Episcopal Jurisdiction in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi>'s Book, named <hi>Appello Caesarem,</hi> must be called in also; not in regard of any false Doctrine contained in it: but, <hi>for being the first cause of those Disputes and Differences which have since much troubled the quiet of the Church</hi>; His Majesty hoping, <hi>That the occasion being taken away, men would no longer trouble themselves with such unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Disputations.</hi> Whether his Majesty did well in doing no more, if the Book contained any false Doctrine in it; or in doing so much, if it were done only to please the Parliament, I take not upon me to determine: But certainly, it never falleth out well with Christian Princes, when they make Religion bend to Policy, or think to gain their ends on men by doing such things as they are not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guided to by the Light of Conscience, And so it hapned to his Majesty at this present time; those two last Actions being looked on only as Tricks of King-craft, done only out of a design for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him more love in the hearts of his People than before he had. Against the calling in of <hi>Mountague</hi>'s Book, it was objected com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to his disadvantage, That it was not done till three years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it came out, till it had been questioned in three several Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, till all the Copies of it were dispersed and sold; and then too, That it was called in without any Censure either of the Author or his Doctrines; That the Author had been punished with a very

good Bishoprick, and the Book seemingly discountenanced, to no other end but to divert those of contrary perswasion from Writing or Acting any thing against it in the following Parliament. And as for <hi>Potter,</hi> what could he have done less in common gratitude, than to prefer him to a Bishoprick, for so many years Service as <hi>Potter</hi> in his time had done him both as Prince and King. So true is that of the wise Historian, <note n="(a)" place="margin">

                  <p>For notwithstanding all these preparatory actions, the Commons were resolved to begin at the same Point where before they ended. The Parliament had been Prorogued as they were hammering a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance against <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> which animated <hi>Chambers, Rouls,</hi> and some other Merc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ants, to refuse the payment; for which refusal some of their Goods was seised by Order from the Lord Treasurer <hi>Weston,</hi> and some of them committed Prisoners by the Kings Command. These matters so possessed their thoughts, that a week was passed before they could resume their old care of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or think of Petitioning his Majesty for a Publick Fast: but at last they fell upon them both. To their Petition for a Fast (not ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to his Majesty till the thirtieth of <hi>Ianuary</hi>) he returned this Answer the next day, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>That this Custom of Fasts at every Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was but lately begun; That he was not so fully satisfied of the necessity of it at this time; That notwithstanding, for the avoiding of Questions and Jealousies, he was pleased to grant them their Request, with this <hi>Proviso,</hi> That it should not hereafter be brought into President but on great occasions: And finally, That as for the form and times thereof he would advise with his Bishops, and then return unto both Houses a particular Answer.</q>
But so long it was before that Answer came unto them, and so perverse were they in crossing with his Majesties Counsels, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was almost ended before the Fast was kept in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> and dissolved many days before it was to have been kept in the rest of the Kingdom. And for Religion, they insisted on it with such importunity, that his Majesty could no longer dissemble his taking notice of it, as a meer artifice and diversion to stave him off from being gratified in the Grant of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> which he so often press'd them to. And thereupon he lets them know, <hi>That he understood the cause of their delay in his business to be</hi> Religion, <hi>of the preservation whereof none of them should have greater care than himself; and that either it must be an Argument he wanted Power to preserve it (which he thought no body would affirm) or at the least, That he was very ill counselled, if it were in so much danger as they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This notwithstanding, they proceed in their former way. His Majesty had granted several Pardons to <hi>Mountague, Cosens, Manwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54785:101"/>
and the men summoned to appear: And Information is preferred by <hi>Iones</hi> against <hi>Mountague</hi>'s Confirmation in the See of <hi>Chichester,</hi> which after many disputes is referred to a Select Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee. Complaint is made against <hi>Neile</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winton.</hi> for for saying to some Divines of his Diocess, <hi>That they must not Preach against Papists now, as they had done formerly. Marshall</hi> and <hi>Moor,</hi> two Doctors in Divinity (but such as had received some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasures from him) are brought in to prove it. Upon him also it was charged, That the Pardons of <hi>Mountague</hi> and <hi>Cosens</hi> were of his procuring: Insomuch that <hi>Eliot</hi> pronounced positively, <hi>That all the Dangers which they feared, were contracted in the person of that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>; and thereupon desired, <hi>That a Motion might be made to his Majesty to leave him to the Iustice of that House.</hi> Many Reports come flowing in to the Committee for Religion, of turning Tables into Altars, adoring towards or before them, and standing up at the Gospels and the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> which must be also taken into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The Articles of <hi>Lambeth</hi> are declared to be the Doctrines of this Church, and all that did oppose them to be called in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Walker</hi> delivered a Petition from the Booksellers and Printers, in complaint of the Restraint of Books written against <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arminianism</hi>; and the contrary allowed of, by the only means of the Bishop of <hi>London</hi>; and, That divers of them had been <hi>Purse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanted</hi> for Printing of <hi>Orthodox Books;</hi> and, That the Licencing of Books was only to be restrained to the said Bishop and his Chaplains. Hereupon followed a Debate amongst them about the Licencing of Books, which having taken up some time, was referred to the Committee also, as the other was. By these Embraceries the Committee for Religion had Work enough, more than they knew how to turn their hands to. But before they could bring any thing to perfection, his Majesty was so exasperated by their rigorous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings against the Farmers of his Customs, the Imprisoning of <hi>Acton</hi> Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> their Voting down his Right to <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> and their threatning Speeches against the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer <hi>Weston,</hi> whom he highly favoured; That on the second of <hi>March</hi> he Adjourned the House, and on the tenth of the same Month Dissolved the Parliament. At which Adjournment some of the Members carried themselves in such an undutiful (I must not say a seditious) manner, that they locked up the Doors of the House, put the Keys into one of their Pockets, excluded the Kings Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from coming in to deliver his Errand, compelled the Speaker to return to his Chair, and held him there by strong hand, till they had thundred out their <hi>Anathema's,</hi> not only against such as should dare to Levy the <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> but those also who should wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly pay it, before it had been granted by Act of Parliament; for which Contempts and Disobediencies, the principal Sticklers were convented by the Lords of the Council, and after brought before the Justices of his Majesties Bench, by whom they were not only
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54785:102"/>
fined, but committed unto several Prisons, notwithstanding all they could pretend or plead from the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> which they so much stood on. So hard a thing it is to finde a cord so strong as to bind the Prerogative, when Kings have either Power or Will to make use thereof.</p>

                     <note place="margin">1629.</note>During this last Parliament, <hi>Leighton,</hi> a <hi>Scot</hi> by birth, a Doctor of Physick by Profession, a fiery <hi>Puritan</hi> in Faction, dedicated a most pestilent Book unto them called <hi>Sions Plea</hi>: In this Book he incited them <hi>to kill all the Bishops, and to smite them under the fifth Rib</hi>; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing also against the <hi>Queen,</hi> whom he branded by the name of an <hi>Idolatress,</hi> a <hi>Canaanite,</hi> and the Daughter of <hi>Heth.</hi> And that this general Doctrine might not be Preached without a particular Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, a Paper was cast into the yard belonging to the House of the Dean of St. <hi>Pauls, March</hi> 2. to this effect; <hi>viz.</hi>

Another was found at the same time and place against the Lord Treasurer, who now is made the Scape-Goat, to bear all those faults in Civil Matters which formerly had been imputed to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> It was no need to bid them have a care of themselves, after two such Warnings: <hi>Leigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> is therefore brought into the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> as soon as he could be apprehended, where he was Sentenced to have his Ears cropp'd, his Nose slit, his Forehead stigmatized, and to be whipped: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sentence and Execution he made his escape out of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> though by better hap to the <hi>Warden,</hi> than to himself, he was retaken in <hi>Bedfordshire,</hi> and underwent the punishment appointed for him; but this hapned not till <hi>November</hi> 29. 1630. The rest of this Year (in reference to our present Story) was of little Action, <hi>Laud</hi> falling into a burning Fever on the fourteenth of <hi>August,</hi> at the House of <hi>Windebank</hi> his old Friend, by which he was brought to such a low and weak estate, that he was not able to reach to his own House till <hi>October</hi> 20. nor to put himself into the Service of his Place till the end of <hi>March.</hi> Yet such was the Activeness of his Spirit, that though his Body was infirm, yet his Thoughts were working. He saw the Church decaying both in Power and Patrimony: Her Patrimony dilapidated by the Avarice of several Bishops, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king havock of their Woods to enrich themselves; and more than so, in filling up their Grants and Leases to the utmost term, after they had been nominated to some other Bishoprick, to the great wrong of their Successors. Her Power he found diminished partly by the Bishops themselves, in leaving their Diocesses unregarded, and living altogether about <hi>Westminster,</hi> to be in a more ready way for the next Preferment; partly by the great increase of Chaplains in the Houses of many private Gentlemen: but chiefly by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54785:102"/>
of Irregular Lecturers, both in City and Country, whose work it was to undermine as well the Doctrine as the Government of it. For the preventing of such mischiefs as might hence ensue, some Conference had passed betwixt him and <hi>Harsnet,</hi> who lately had succeeded <hi>Mountain</hi> (before he had half warmed his Chair) in the See of <hi>York</hi>; and certain Considerations were resolved upon to be propounded to the King, for the peace and well-ordering of the Church; which being reduced into form, and by <hi>Laud</hi> present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Majesty, were first signed by his Majesties Royal Hand, and published in <hi>December</hi> following by the Title of <hi>His Majesties Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the most Reverend Father in God</hi> George <hi>Lord Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>containing certain Orders to be observed and put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution by the several Bishops in his Province:</hi> Which said Instructions were as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Reader may think strange that in the second of these Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we should find any Bishop under a supposition of having no Episcopal house for his habitation; concerning which he is to know that the Bishops of <hi>Oxon</hi> at that time had no house left belonging to their Episcopal See, either in the City, or in the Country: but dwelt at their Parsonage houses which they held in <hi>commendam,</hi> as before Dr. <hi>Bridges,</hi> who had no <hi>commendam</hi> within the Diocess, did for the most part in hired houses. For though at the foundation of the Bishoprick of <hi>Oxon,</hi> in the Abbey of <hi>Oseney</hi> the King appointed <hi>Glocester</hi> Hall for the Bishops Palace; yet when that foundation was dissolved, and the Bishops See removed to <hi>Christ Church,</hi> the Grant of <hi>Glocester</hi> Hall was dissolved also. The Bishops thereupon retired to some Country house within the Diocess, which appertained unto them in the right of their See, as long as any of their Mannours, Land, and Houses were left unsould. But they being finally made a prey to the Lust and Sacriledge of some great persons, they have since lived for the most part in hired houses, or on their <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> (if they had any such) within their Diocesses, till the year

ease and a full belly in these Gentlemens houses, from whom there was some possibility of preferment also, which better Scholars then themselves might have otherwise hoped for. Such of the Bishops as were possessed of the poorer Bishopricks were as much troubled as the other, and thought it the worst kind of banishments to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined unto the Country; complaining privately, that now the Court-Bishops had served their own turns upon the King, they cared not what miseries their poor brethren were exposed unto; who if they were constrained to live in their Episcopal houses, or in any other place within their Diocesses, must be constrained also to keep up such a Port, and maintain such open Hospitality as their Revenues could not bear. Nor was it thought a less injury to them, that they could not make the best of their time, but were required to be good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands for another man, who was to enjoy the place which they were to leave; when they were fain to take it as it came to their hands, without any prevention going before, or satisfaction following after.</p>

For what less could be aimed at in them than suppressing the Divine Ordinance of Preaching, or at the least, a dreadful diminution of the number of Sermons; And what could follow thereupon, but negligence in the Priests, ignorance in the People, <hi>Popery</hi> and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition in the mean time gaining ground on both. Spending the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons in teaching the Catechism was a work fitter for a <hi>Pedagogue</hi> than a preaching Minister, who rather were ordained to provide <hi>strong meats</hi> for men, than <hi>milk</hi> for babes; and yet such was the strictness of the said <hi>Instructions,</hi> in looking to the observance of the late <hi>Declaration,</hi> that they were not suffered to set <hi>strong meats</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people, though men of ripe years, and somewhat more than children in their understandings. Preaching must be restrained hereafter to Gods Will <hi>revealed,</hi> to Faith in Christ, and Moral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties toward God and men: but as for his secret Will and Purpose in the unfathomable depths of <hi>Predestination,</hi> those must be kept sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up under lock and key, and none but the <hi>Arminians</hi> have the opening of them. And yet the grief had been the less if <hi>Lecturers</hi> had been left to their former liberty, and not tied up to <hi>Gown</hi> and <hi>Surplice,</hi> or fettered with <hi>Parochial</hi> cures, and consequently with Subscriptions and Canonical Oaths; badges of Antichrist, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed enemies to the pure Freedom of the Gospel. Where might a man repair with comfort to hear Gods Word preached in truth and simplicity, the Sacraments administred in their original naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; to hear Christ speaking in his Prophets, and the Prophets speaking to the People if this world went on? But notwithstanding these secret Murmurs on the one side, and the open Clamours of the other, <hi>Laud</hi> was resolved to do his duty, who summoning all the

                     <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Lecturers</hi> about the City of <hi>London</hi> to appear before him, made a solemn Speech, in which he pressed the necessity of his Majesties said <hi>Instructions</hi> for the good of the Church, and of their chearful obedience to them; He directed Letters also to every Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon in his Diocess requiring them to see them published to all the Clergy, and to give him an exact account at the end of their Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions how they were observed; especially insisting on the third In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, <hi>For keeping the Kings Declaration, that so the differences and disputes in those prohibited points might be laid aside.</hi> The like care taken also by the rest of the Bishops, but slackning by degrees when the heat was over; and possibly in short time after they had not been looked into at all, if <hi>Abbot</hi> had continued longer in the See of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury:</hi> or that his Majesty had not enjoyned the Bishops to give him an exact account of their proceedings in the said particulars, not once for all, but Annually once in every year, on the second of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary.</hi> Which care being taken for the peace and happiness of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we will lay hold upon this opportunity for crossing over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and taking a short view of the state of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in that Country; which from henceforth shall be lookt into more than hath been formerly.</p>
                  <p>Concerning which we are to know, that when the Reformation was advanced in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the first care was to let the people have the Bible, the publick Liturgie, and certain godly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in the English tongue; as appeareth by the Statutes 2, 3. <hi>Edw.</hi> vi. 5, 6. <hi>Edw.</hi> vi. and 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Secondly, The like care was taken of the <hi>Welch</hi>; For whose Instruction it was further ordered, partly by the Queen, and partly by Act of Parliament, in the fifth of her Reign, that as well the Bible as the Common-Prayer Book should be Translated, Printed, and Published in that Language; one Book of each sort to be provided for every several Church at the Charge of the Parish. Which being Printed at the first in the large Church-Volume, was afterwards reduced to a more portable bulk for Domestical uses by the cost and charge of <hi>Rowland Heylyn,</hi> Citizen and Alderman of <hi>London,</hi> about the beginning of the Reign of this King. But for <hi>Ireland</hi> no such care was taken. The Acts of the Supremacy, and of the Consecrations of Archbishops and Bishops were received there as before in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>English Liturgie</hi> imposed on them by order from hence, and confirmed by Parliament in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Which notwithstanding not only the <hi>Kernes,</hi> or natural wild <hi>Irish,</hi> but many of the better sort of the Nation, either remain in their old barbarous ignorance, or else adhere unto the Pope, or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to their own superstitious fancies, as in former times. And to say truth, it is no wonder that they should, there being no care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to instruct them in the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, either by translating the Bible, or the English <hi>Liturgy,</hi> into their own Language, as was done in <hi>Wales</hi>; but forcing them to come to the English Service, which they understood no more than they did the <hi>Mass.</hi> By means

whereof the <hi>Irish</hi> are not only kept in continual ignorance, as to the Doctrine and Devotions of the Church of <hi>England</hi>: but those of <hi>Rome</hi> are furnished with an excellent argument for having the Service of the Church in a Language which the Common people understand not. And though somewhat may be pleaded in excuse thereof, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the unquietness of that Kingdom under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who had the least part of it in her possession; yet no sufficient plea can be made in defence of it for the time succeeding, when the whole Country was reduced, and every part thereof lay open to the course of Justice.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these men and <hi>Baroe</hi> there grew some disputes, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards begat some heats, and those heats brake out at last into open <hi>Factions.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Whitaker, Perkins, Chaderton,</hi> and others of the same opinion, thought it expedient to effect that by power which they were not able to obtain by Argument. And to that end Preoccupate the most Reverend Archbishop <hi>Whitgift</hi> with most sad complaints touching the Rupture made by <hi>Baroe</hi> in that Vniversity.

                        <item>II. <hi>The moving or efficient cause of Predestination unto life, is not the foresight of Faith, or of perseverance, or of God-works, or of any thing that is in the person predestinated. but only the good will and pleasure of God.</hi>

                        <item>VIII. <hi>No man can come unto Christ unless it shall be given unto him, and unless the Father shall draw him; and all men are not drawn by the Father that they may come to the Son.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>IX. <hi>It is not in the will or power of every one to be saved.</hi>

But that which the <hi>Calvinians</hi> could not get in <hi>England</hi> they effected at the last in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; where the true and genuine Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had been less looked after than at home. For in the year 1615. a Parliament and Convocation being holden in <hi>Dublin,</hi> it was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on by the Archbishop, Bishops, and the rest of the Clergy then assembled, that a Book of Articles should be framed to be the

                  <p>And yet they did not stay there neither. The <hi>Sabbatarian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines had been broached by <hi>Bownd</hi> in the same year wherein the nine Articles had been made at <hi>Lambeth:</hi> Which being opposed by Archbishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and never admitted in this Church, were by the cunning of that Faction, and the zeal or diligence of this man, incorporated into the Body of the Articles for the Church of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; in which it is declared for a Doctrinal Point, <hi>That the first day of the Week, which is the</hi> Lords-day, <hi>is wholly to be dedicated to the Service of God; and therefore we are</hi> Bound <hi>therein to rest from our common and daily Business, and to bestow that leisure upon holy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, both Publick and Private.</hi> And because he concluded in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that the <hi>Pope</hi> was <hi>Antichrist,</hi> that also must be made an Article of this Confession, in which we find it in these words, <hi>viz. The Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>is so far from being the Supream Head of the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church, that his Works and Doctrines do plainly discover him to be the</hi> Man of Sin, <hi>foretold in the Holy Scripture, whom the Lord shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume with the Spirit of his mouth, and abolish with the brightness of his coming.</hi> And hereunto, That the Plantation of the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Vlster</hi> (unhappily projected in the time of King <hi>Iames</hi>) brought in so much <hi>Puritanism</hi> such a contempt of Bishops, such a neglect of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Liturgie,</hi> and other Divine Offices of this Church, that there was nothing less to be found amongst them than the Doctrine, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Forms of Worship established in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Papists</hi> in the mean time encreasing more and more, grew at the last to so great a confidence, by the clashings here in <hi>England</hi> betwixt the King and his Parliaments, that they gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves great hope of a <hi>Toleration</hi>: And possibly enough they might have obtained somewhat like it, if the <hi>Irish</hi> Bishops had not joined together in a <hi>Protestation</hi> to the contrary, and caused it to be publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Pulpit by the Bishop of <hi>Derry,</hi> with infinite Acclamations of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Hearers. Howsoever, the lost hopes had so far emboldened them, that they set up some Religious Houses even in <hi>Dublin</hi> it self, shewed themselves openly in their Friars Habits, and publickly affronted not only the Mayor, but the Archbishop of that City.

Which said, he lets his Lordship know, That the Estate of his Church was very miserable; That the Cathedral Church of <hi>Ardagh</hi> (united to the See of <hi>Killmore</hi>) one of the most ancient in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and said to be built by St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> together with the Bishops House there, was down to the ground; That the Church at <hi>Killmore</hi> had been built, but without Bell or Steeple, Font or Chalice; That the Parish-Churches were all in a manner ruined, or unroofed and unrepaired; That the People, saving a few <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Planters here and there, (which are not the tenth part of the Remnant) were obstinate Recusants; That there was a <hi>Popish</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, more numerous by far than the <hi>English</hi> Clergy; That they were in full Exercise of all Jurisdiction Ecclesiastical by their <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars-general</hi> and <hi>Officials,</hi> who were so confident as to Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate those that come to the Courts of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Bishops; That the <hi>Popish Primate</hi> for <hi>Ireland</hi> lived within two miles of his House, and the <hi>Bishops</hi> in another part of his <hi>Diocess</hi> further off; That every Parish had their <hi>Priest,</hi> and some two or three apiece, and so their <hi>Massing-houses</hi> also; and that <hi>Masses</hi> are sometimes said in their Churches; That there were <hi>Friars</hi> in divers places, who went about, though not in their Habit, who by their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate begging did impoverish the People; That Poverty was much increased, as well by their paying double Tythes both to their own <hi>Clergy</hi> and the <hi>English,</hi> as by the dearth of Corn, and the death of their Cattel; That the Oppressions of the Courts Ecclesiastical (which was reckoned for another cause of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon poverty) were not indeed to be excused, which for his part he
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54785:107"/>
had a purpose to reform; That in each Diocess there were some seven or eight Ministers of good sufficiency; but being <hi>English,</hi> they neither understood the Tongue of the People, nor could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any Divine Offices, nor converse with them as they ought, and consequently could give no stop to the growth and increase o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Popery</hi>; That most of the said Ministers held two, three, four, or more Vicaridges apiece; and that sometimes one man was Clerk of three or four Parishes, which were ordinarily bought, sold, and let to Farm: And finally, That by those and such other means, his majesty was King as to the Hearts and Consciences of that People; but so, that it remained wholly at the <hi>Popes</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</q>

                     </note> it pleased his Majesty to send him the joyful news, under his Royal Signature, of the Princes Birth, born at his Majesties House of St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s on <hi>Saturday May</hi> the twenty ninth, about one of the Clock in the afternoon. He had the happiness of seeing the Royal Infant in the first hour of his Birth, and the honour afterwards to Baptize him. By ancient Priviledge belonging to the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> those Archbishops are Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Court; his Majesties Houshold, wheresoever the same shall be, being reckoned to be his Parishioners, or of his peculiar. But <hi>Abbot</hi> being at that time infirm, or otherwise of no desirable Company, this Office was devolved on <hi>Laud,</hi> as Dean of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and he accordingly performed it. The Birth of this young Prince, as it gave cause of great Rejoycings to all good Subjects, so it gave no small matter of discouragement to the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, who had laid their Line another way, and desired not that this King should have had any Children: Insomuch that at a Feast in <hi>Fryday-street,</hi> when some of the Company shewed great joy at the news of the Queens first being with Child, a leading man of that Faction (whom I could name, were it worth the while) did not stick to say, <hi>That he could see no such cause of joy as the others did.</hi> Which said, he gave this Reason for it; <hi>That God had already better provided for us than we had deserved, in giving such a hopeful Progeny by the Queen of</hi> Bohemia, <hi>brought up in the Reformed Religion; whereas it was uncertain what Religion the Kings Children would follow, being to be brought up under a Mother so devoted to the Church of</hi> Rome. And I remember that being at a Town in <hi>Glocestershire,</hi> when the news came of the Princes Birth, there was great Joy shewed by all the rest of the Parish, in causing Bonfires to be made, and the Bells to be rung, and sending Victuals unto those of the younger sort, who were most busily imployed in the publick Joy: But so, that from the rest of the Houses, being of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Puritan</hi> Party, there came neither Man, nor Child, nor Wood, nor Victuals; their doors being shut close all the evening, as in a time of general mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and disconsolation.</p>
                  <p>It was not long after the Birth of this new Prince, that the <hi>Feoffees</hi> for buying in <hi>Impropriations</hi> were called in question. The Project took beginning about four years since, when <hi>Preston</hi> Governed the Affairs of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction; at what time it was resolved amongst them, to set up stipendary <hi>Lectures</hi> in all or most Market-Towns, where the People had commonly less to do, and consequently were
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54785:108"/>
more apt to Faction and Innovation than in other places; and of all Market-Towns, to chuse such as were Priviledged for sending Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses to the High Court of Parliament: Which that it might be done with the less charge to the People, who commonly love that Religion best which comes cheapest to them, it was agreed to raise a common Stock amongst them, for buying in such Impropriations as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the hands of the <hi>Laity.</hi> To this end they erected a kind of Corporation amongst themselves, consisting of twelve Persons, Clergymen, Citizens, and Lawyers, enabling them to receive and expend such Monies as their Emissaries should bring in from their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Circuits. Their names, <hi>Gouge, Offspring, Sibbs,</hi> and <hi>Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> Ministers; <hi>Eyre, Brown, White,</hi> and <hi>Sherland,</hi> Lawyers; <hi>Geering, Davis, Harwood,</hi> and <hi>Bridges,</hi> Citizens; to whom was afterwards added <hi>Rowland Heylyn</hi> Aldernian of the City of <hi>London,</hi> by the name of Treasurer to the Company, that there might be a casting Voice amongst them, as occasion served. Great were the Sums of Money which the Piety of the Design, and the Diligence of their Limitaries brought in from their several Walks; most men admiring, all applauding the nobleness of such a Popular and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Act. But so it hapned, that one of the Fellows of <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> Colledge, resorting frequently to a Town in <hi>Glocestershire,</hi> where one of these new <hi>Lectures</hi> had been founded by them, observed these two things: First, That the Impropriation of that place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the same Lay-hands as before it did; and therefore that the <hi>Lecturer</hi> must receive his Stipend from the Profits of some other Parish: And secondly, he observed, That the man there planted in that <hi>Lecture</hi> was one of a notorious Inconformity, found upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther search to have been hunted from one Diocess to another, till at last he was Silenced upon that account by the <hi>High-Commission.</hi> This gave him the first hint of making a more diligent Inquiry into that Design; and the more he looked into it, the worse he liked it. He knew so much of some, and heard so much of all the rest which were trusted in the Conduct of it, that he could hope for no good to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from any thing of their projectment; For if such publick mischiefs be presaged by <hi>Astrologers</hi> from the Conjunctions of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> though the first of them be a <hi>Planet</hi> of a most sweet and gentle Influence; what Dangers, what Calamities might not be feared from the Conjunction of twelve such Persons, of which there was not one that wished well to the present Government.</p>
                  <p>Having gone thus far in the Discovery, it pleased the <hi>President</hi> of his Colledge, being then <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi> to appoint him to Preach the Act Sermon at St. <hi>Maries</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi> in the afternoon, <hi>Iuly</hi> 11. 1630. To which appointment he submitted, resolving to deliver something in that great concourse of People from all parts of the Kingdom, which might serve to undeceive them in that Particular. He had chosen for his Text those words in the thirteenth of St.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54785:108"/>
                     <hi>Matthew,</hi> viz. <hi>But while men slept, the enemy came and sowed tares amongst the wheat, and went his way.</hi> Beginning to draw toward the end of his Sermon, he thus began to unfold the Arras, and shew the Portraicture thereof in as lively Colours as he could,
<q>Planting, saith he, also many Pensionary Lecturers in so many places where it need not, and upon days of common labour, will at the best bringing forth of fruit, appear to be a tare indeed, though now no wheat be counted tares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We will proceed a little on further in the proposal of some things to be considered. The Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Feoffees</hi> for buying in Impropriations to the Church; Doth it not seem in the appearance to be an excellent piece of <hi>Wheat</hi>? A noble and gracious point of piety? Is not this <hi>Templum Domini, Templum Domini</hi>? But blessed God, that men should thus draw near unto thee with their mouths, and yet be far from thee in their hearts! For what are those intrusted in the managing of this great business? Are they not the most of them the most active and the best affected men in the whole cause, and <hi>Magna Partium momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> Chief Patrons of the Faction? And what are those whom they prefer? Are they not most of them such as must be serviceable to their dangerous innovations? And will they not in time have more preferments to bestow, and therefore more dependencies than all the Prelates in the Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet all this while we sleep and slumber, and fold our hands in sloth, and see perhaps, but dare not note it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>No sooner were these words delivered, but a general consterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shewed it self in the looks of his Auditors. Some honest and well meaning men seemed much to pitty his misfortune in being put (as it was then generally, but falsly, thought) on that odious task by some higher power, of purpose to discourage such a pious work which good men rejoyced at. But greater was the clamour of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, who in a meeting held that night conceived no punishment great enough to inflict upon him which either Law, Malice, or Revenge could expose him to. Being thus alarmed on the one side, and threatned by the other, he sent a Copy of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> not long before made Chancellour of that University; and signified in a Letter therewith sent, that he was both able and ready to make good his charge, whensoever it should be required. This information came opportunely to his Lordship, with whom the King had used some Speech (as appears by his <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate</hi> p. 12.) about restoring Impropriations to the Church, which this new project seemed to frustrate. And thereupon he entred it in the <hi>Memorandum</hi> at the end of his <hi>Breviate,</hi> viz. <hi>To overthrow the</hi> Feoffment, <hi>dangerous both to Church and State, going under the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretence of buying in Impropriations.</hi> The Preacher in the mean time making a further search into the business, observed these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, first, That no Impropriation by them bought, was laid unto the Parish Church, and settled upon the present Incumbent, as was first
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54785:109"/>
expected, that being utterly destructive of their design. Secondly, That a great part of that Revenue was spent in maintaining a dayly Lecture in the Church of St. <hi>Antholins</hi> at six a clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to serve for a <hi>Seminary</hi> for the training up of such <hi>Novices</hi> as were to be sent into the Country. Thirdly, That another part of it was laid out, not only for the support of silenced Ministers, during their own lives, but of their Wives and Children also after their decease, than which there could not be a greater tye to unite men to them, and make them sticklers in the Cause. Fourthly, These Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions neither were so settled, nor their Lectures so well established in their several places: but that the one might be withdrawn, and the other removed, at the will and pleasure of their Patrons, if they grew slack and negligent in the <hi>holy cause,</hi> which fastened a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on them to the very last. It was not long before <hi>Noy,</hi> that Renowned Lawyer, was made his Majesties Atturney General, to whom the Preacher was commanded to deliver a particular of all such passages as he had observed in the carrying on of this design; the Feoffees thereupon being called into the Court of Exchequer, the Feoffment damned, the Impropriations by them bought confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to his Majesties use, and the merit of the cause re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erred to a further censure. And though the Sentence past not on them in the Court of Exchequer, <hi>Anno</hi> 1632. yet I have laid all here together, that so I might proceed to the rest of my business with the less di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance.</p>
                  <p>For whilest the business of these <hi>Feoffees</hi> was under a more strict enquiry, some things were acted by this Bishop, which brought him into the like danger of an Inquisition. St. <hi>Catherine Creed</hi> Church in <hi>London</hi> being ruinous, and in great decay, had in some places been taken almost down to the ground, and rebuilt again by the Parishioners at such time as <hi>Mountain</hi> was their Bishop, who suffered it to be made use of for Religious Offices without any new consecration of it, which coming to the knowledge of Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> he caused it for a time to be suspended from all Divine Service, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and Sacraments, till it was reconsecrated by himself. Which Office he solemnly performed on Sunday <hi>Ianuary</hi> 16. An infinite number of people of all sorts drawing together to behold that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony to which they had so long been strangers, ignorant altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Antiquity and the necessity of it. The like done also at the Church of St. <hi>Giles</hi> in the Fields on the Sunday after; which had been generally repaired, and for the greatest part new built in the time of his Predecessor also; Divine Service, Preaching, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Sacraments being used therein, without any such dedication of it, contrary to the practice of the Primitive times and the Ancient Canons. And that we may lay these things together, the next year after, <hi>Iune</hi> the seventh, he consecrated a new Church at <hi>Hammersmith,</hi> built at the charges of that Village; and the next <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ear after that, <hi>Iuly</hi> the seventeenth, a new Church built at <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54785:109"/>
magna,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> erected at the sole cost and charges of Sir <hi>Iohn Wolstenholm,</hi> one of the Farmers of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, who made that day a sumptuous and magnificent Feast for the entertainment of all such persons of quality as resorted thither to behold the Consecration. It was my chance to bestow a visit on his Lordship at his house in <hi>Fulham,</hi> as he was preparing to set forwards to this last Consecration; and being one of his Chaplains was at that time absent, and that he was of ordinary course to make use of two, he took me along with him to perform the Office of the Priest in the solemnity, in which his Chaplain <hi>Bray</hi> was to Act the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons. I observed all the Circumstances and religious Ceremonies which were used by him in that sacred Action from his first coming into the Church till his going out, but could see nothing in it sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring of that Superstition which had raised so much talk amongst ignorant People, and afterwards was certified by <hi>Willingham</hi> at the time of his trial in reference to the consecration of St. <hi>Katherine Creed Church.</hi> The Antiquity of which Consecrations hath been shown in our <hi>Introduction</hi> performed by the Fathers at such times when the Church hated nothing more than superstitious vanities, or the accumulating of unnecessary and fruitless Ceremonies. The form and manner of it left by our first <hi>Reformers</hi> to the care and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Bishops whom it most concerned; Presuming that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would be done by them which would not be consistent with the Rules of Piety, and the ancient practise of the Church in the times foregoing. And such a Form was that which this Bishop now made use of, digested first by the learned <hi>Andrews</hi> for his own particular use, but afterwards copied out, approved and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (though possibly not without some alterations) by most Bishops else.</p>
                  <p>Nor did he take care only of the Fabrick, the material Church, to make it fit and ready for Gods publick Service: but that Gods publick Service should be so done in it, as might most tend to the edification of the Mystical Church, the body aggregate of Gods People. His Majesty had took special care, as well by his Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the fourteenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1626. as by his Declaration before the Articles, 1628. for the silencing of all disputes touching Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination, and the points depending thereupon, which had begun to threaten such a general disturbance to the peace of the Church. But neither Proclamation, nor Declaration could perswade the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian</hi> Party unto any such silence, which they interpreted to be a plain betraying of Gods Cause into the hands of his enemies. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what is to be done to conjure down these unruly Spirits, which otherwise would not be confined within their Circle. <hi>Mady,</hi> the Lecturer of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> near <hi>Newgate,</hi> must needs fly out upon the Point of <hi>Election,</hi> and the motives to it. For this contempt he is called before the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and on some further misbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour prohibited from preaching any more within that Diocess.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54785:110"/>
                     <hi>Burges</hi> (who afterwards pulled down the Cross in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard) must needs add scorn to his contempt; telling his Auditors, that if their Minister preached <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Arminianism</hi> they might change their dwellings, and not trouble the peace and order of their Church. For which about the same time he is questioned also. <hi>White,</hi> and some others, in that Diocess suspended by this Bishop on the same occasion.</p>
                  <p>From the City pass we to the Court. Where toward the end of the same <hi>Month</hi> we find <hi>Davenant</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi> preaching a Lent Sermon before the King, and therein falling upon some of those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited points, even before his face, for which the King being much offended (as he had good reason) he caused him to be called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords of his Council. The cause is managed against him by Archbishop <hi>Harsnet</hi> (<hi>Laud</hi> all the while walking by in silence) who gravely laid before him as well the Kings Piety in setting forth the said Declaration, as the greatness of his, the said <hi>Davenants,</hi> offence, in making so little reckoning of it. <hi>Davenant</hi> at first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoureth many defences to make good his Action, but at last wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly casts himself upon this submission, he tells the Lords, in answer to one of <hi>Harsnets</hi> objections,<note place="margin">

Arundel,</hi> Earl Marshal, bids him hold to that, as his safest plea, and that he should proceed to no further defence; a bad cause not being made the better by two much handling. To this counsel he conforms himself. And being afterwards admitted to the kiss of his Majesties hand (which his attendance might deserve, though his Sermon did not) his Majesty declared to him his Resolution,
<q>That he would not have this high Point meddled withal or debated, either the one way or the other, because it was too high for the Peoples understanding; and that other Points which concerned Reformation and Newness of life, were more needful and profitable.</q>
I hope the lower Clergy will not say hereafter as some did of old, That Laws are like the Spiders Cobwebs, which suffer the great flies to break through, and lay hold only upon those of the smaller size.</p>

But worse it fared not long after with <hi>Ford</hi> of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Hall, <hi>Hodges</hi> of <hi>Exeter</hi> Colledge, and <hi>Thorne</hi> of <hi>Baliol,</hi> who in their several Sermons had not only committed the like error, but charged their <hi>Renovation</hi> of some ancient order in the Church, to be no other than plain <hi>Innovation.</hi> Questioned for this by <hi>Smith,</hi> then Warden of <hi>Wadham</hi> Colledge, and Vice-Chancellor of that University, they appeal from him to the Convocation. The Proctors, having unadvisedly received the Appeal, were at the point to have named <hi>Delegates</hi> when <hi>Smith</hi> appealed to the King: But they took their aim amiss when they shot this bolt; For both his Majesty and the Chancellor were alike concerned in it; the King, to justifie his Declaration; the other, to preserve his own power and dignity; neither of which could have been done, but by defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Smith</hi> in his lawful acting. On the twenty third of <hi>August</hi> all Parties interessed in the Cause appeared before the King at <hi>Woodstock,</hi> who after a full hearing of both sides, it was ordered thus, That the three Delinquents should be expelled the University; <hi>Doughty</hi> and <hi>Bruch,</hi> the two <hi>Proctors,</hi> should be deprived of their places: <hi>Prideaux</hi> and <hi>Wilkinson</hi> (this last then Principle of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Hall) being checked for stickling so much in it, and glad they were that they escaped without further censure. But they shewed not the same mercy which they found; for <hi>Rainsford</hi> of <hi>Wadham</hi> Colledge, preached at St. <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>August</hi> following in defence of <hi>Vniversal Grace,</hi> and <hi>Mans Election unto life, from Faith foreseen.</hi> No man more forward than <hi>Prideaux</hi> to appeach him of it, on whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint and prosecution he was sentenced to a publick acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his offence in a form prescribed; which was as much as had been done in the case of <hi>Hill.</hi> So that the Rigid <hi>Calvinians</hi> can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no just ground for that so great Calumnie, that none but they were censured from preaching those prohibited Doctrines; those of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Party (as they commonly called them) going off unpunished.</p>

<q>For, having first commended him for his great learning and various reading manifested in his Book <hi>De Primodiis Britannicarum Ecclesiarum,</hi> he magnifies next his singular wisdom for taking an occasion to insert therein the History of the <hi>Pelagian Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi> coming so opportunely in his way; and then he addeth, that his History of <hi>Gotteschalchus was a piece of the like nature, and came forth most seasonable,</hi> so much the more because it seemed to

By questioning and suppressing <hi>Downham</hi>'s Book, he might be made as sensible of his Error in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the aforesaid History, as if his own had been made subject to the like condemnation. His Majesty therefore gives him Order, by Letters bearing date at <hi>Woodstock, August</hi> 24. (the next day after the said Sentence of <hi>Thorn, Hodges, &amp;c.</hi>) to call in Bishop <hi>Downham</hi>'s Book, who thereupon sent out Warrants, and caused all the Books that were unsent into <hi>England,</hi> to be seised on: But so long it was before the King had notice of it, and so long after that, before his Letters came to the Lord Primates hands, which was not till the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>October</hi> following, that almost all the Copies were disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> before the coming out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition. And for preventing of the like for the time to come, a Command is laid on <hi>Beadle</hi> Bishop of <hi>Killmore</hi> (which sheweth that <hi>Vsher</hi> was not thought fit to be trusted in it) to have an eye unto the Press, and to take care that nothing hereafter should be published contrary to his Majesties said Directions: So <hi>Beadle</hi> in his Letter to the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> dated <hi>November</hi> 8. 1631. Which care being taken for the Peace of that Church, and nothing else presented to us on that side of the Sea to detain us any longer there, we will hoise Sail again for <hi>England,</hi> where we finde more Work.</p>
                  <p>More Work indeed, and far the greatest not only of this present year, but the greatest of this Bishops Life: A Work before in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but in project only. None had the Courage or the Power to carry it on so far as he: He could not rest under the shade of those vast Ruines of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church (his own Cathedral) without conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual thought, and some hopes withal of repairing those deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in it, which by long time had been contracted. Of the first Founding of this Church by <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian King and the sixth Monarch of the <hi>Saxons</hi>; and the Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the same by <hi>Erkenwald</hi> the fourth Bishop of it, we have spoke already: And now we are to know, That their old Fabrick being much wasted by Fire in the time of the Conqueror, <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London, Anne</hi> 1083. began the Foundation of that most magnificent Pile now standing, <hi>viz.</hi> all the Body of the Church, with the South and North cross Isles. Toward which Work he made use of a great part of the Materials of the old <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Castle (standing in the same place where the Covent of the <hi>Black-Friars</hi> was after built) great part whereof had perished by the

And after him (some other Bishops succeeding between them) that <hi>Richard,</hi> who was Treasurer to King <hi>Henry</hi> ii. being made Bishop of <hi>London</hi> in the first year of King <hi>Richard,</hi> bestowed great Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the Reparation of this Church, and the Episcopal Houses which belonged unto it. But all this Charge was principally laid out on the main Body of the Church, and the Crossed Isles thereof, the Choire not holding Proportion with so vast a Structure: So that resolving to make it fairer and more capacious than before, they began with the Steeple, which was finished in <hi>Anno</hi> 1221. (5 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3,) In which year the Dedication of it was celebrated with great mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, the King himself, <hi>Otho</hi> the <hi>Popes Legate, Edmond</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Canterbury, Roger</hi> sirnamed <hi>Niger</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London</hi> (a chief Advancer of the Work) with five other Bishops, besides infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite multitudes of the Nobility, Gentry, Citizens, and others of the Common People from all parts of the Land, being present at it.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it to be thought that the Charges of that stately and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Structure was supported by the Bishops only, or issued out of such Revenues as belonged unto the Dean and Chapter; but that the Clergy and People generally, both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed largely to the Work; the People of those Times, out of their Devotion to Gods Service, being easily incited to further all Works of this nature as occasion offered. And this appears by the sundry Letters of several Bishops of both Nations, to the Clergy under their Jurisdiction, for recommendation of that business to their particular Congregations, many of which are extant still upon Record. Nor were the People stirred on only by the sollicitation of their Priests, or the exhortatory Letters of their several Prelates; but by the grants of such Indulgences, and relaxation from their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral and respective Penances, which in those Letters were extended unto all sorts of People, who with a chearful heart and liberal hand did promote the Service: By means whereof some men contributed Materials, others sent in Money; and many Masons, Carpenters, and other Artificers, who were to labour in the Work, bestowed their pains and toil upon it for less consideration and reward than in other Buildings. Besides which, <hi>Henry de Lacy</hi> Earl of <hi>Lincoln</hi> is said to have been a principal Benefactor to that part of it which was then called the <hi>New-Work,</hi> in a Chappel whereof, dedicated to St. <hi>Dunstan,</hi> we find his body to be interred. And so was <hi>Ralph de Baldock</hi> also, both while he was Dean, and when he was Bishop of this Church; whose Body was also buried in another part of the <hi>New-Work,</hi> called <hi>Our Ladies Chappel.</hi>

                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:54785:112"/>But this vast Pile, the Work of so long time, and so many Ages, was on the fourth of <hi>Iune, Anno</hi> 1561. in danger to be suddenly consumed by a violent Fire, beginning in the Steeple, and occasioned by the negligence of a Plummer, who left his pan of coals unquench'd at his going to dinner. A Fire so violent, that in the space of few hours it consumed not only the Steeple where it first began, but did spread it self to the upper Roof of the Church and Isles, totally burning all the Rafters, and whatsoever else was of combustible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Queen knew well, as well as any, that the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of that Church were so dilapidated, that neither the Bishops themselves, nor the Dean and Chapters, were able to repair the least part of those Ruines which the Fire had made: And thereupon out of a deep apprehension of that lamentable Accident, forthwith di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected her Letters to the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> requiring him to make some speedy Order for its repair; and to further the Work, gave out of her Purse 1000 Marks in Gold, as also a Warrant for 1000 Load of Timber to be taken out of her Woods, and elsewhere. Nor were the Citizens slack herein; for having given a large Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, they added three whole <hi>Fifteens</hi> to be speedily paid for that purpose; all which amounted to three thousand two hundred forty seven pound sixteen shillings two pence half-peny. The Clergy of <hi>England</hi> within the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> freely contributed the fortieth part of all such Church Livings as were charged with First-fruits, and the thirtieth part of all their Benefices not so charged; those of <hi>London</hi> only excepted, who besides the thirtieth part of such as paid First-fruits, gave the twentieth part of all the rest: Which Contribution of the Clergy amounted to one thousand four hundred sixty one pound thirteen shillings and eleven pence; whereunto was added, by the benevolence of the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> at several times, coming in all to nine hundred five pound one shilling and eleven pence; By the Dean and Chapter one hundred thirty six pound thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen shillings and four pence: and made of the surplusage of Timber one hundred nineteen pound three shillings and nine pence; Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Justices and Officers of the Common Pleas thirty four pound five shillings; and by those of the Kings Bench seventeen pound sixteen shillings eight pence: All which together made no more than six thousand seven hundred and two pound thirteen shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and four pence. And yet with this small Sum (such was the cheapness of those Times) the Work was carried on so prosperously, that before the Month of <hi>April</hi> 1566. all the Roofs of Timber (whereof those large ones of the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> framed in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> and brought by Sea) were perfectly finished and covered with Lead; the adding of a new Steeple being thought unnecessary (because too chargeable) though divers Models have been made and presented of it.</p>
                  <p>The whole Roof being thus Repaired, the Stone-work of it stood as before it did, sensibly decaying day by day, by reason of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding

quality of the Sea-coal smoke, which on every side annoyed it: Which being observed by one <hi>Henry Farley,</hi> about the middle of the Reign of King <hi>Iames,</hi> he never left solliciting the King by several Petitions and Addresses, to take the Ruinous Estate thereof into his Princely Consideration, till at last it was resolved on by the King. And to create the greater Veneration to so good a Work, he bestowed that magnificent Visit on it, described at large in the first Book of this History, <hi>Anno</hi> 1620. The product and result whereof was, the issuing out a Commission under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> bearing date the sixteenth day of <hi>November</hi> then next following, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to Sir <hi>Francis Iones</hi> Knight, then Lord Mayor of <hi>London, George</hi> Lord Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury, Francis</hi> Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> then Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and divers others, to the number of sixty Persons and upwards: Which Commission importing, That this Church being the greatest and most eminent (as also one of the principal Ornaments) of the Realm, and in much decay, any six or more of these Commissioners, whereof three to be of the said Kings Privy-Council, should meet to make Particulars of the decay, and likewise what Houses, Cellars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had been built near it, either to the annoyance of it, or the Church-yard: And moreover to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what Lands, Rents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had been given towards its Repair, or Sums of Money collected to that purpose, and not accordingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed: And further to consider of the most fit and proper means to raise money to carry on the said Repair: And lastly, to appoint Surveyors and other Officers of their Work, and to make Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of their Proceedings therein, into the Chancery. Upon the Meeting of which Commissioners, and diligent search made into the Particulars afore-mentioned, it was acknowledged that the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> had the whole care of the Body of that Church, and the Dean and Chapter of the Choires: But that which each of them enjoyed to this purpose, was so little, that they yearly expended double as much upon the Roof and other parts decayed, to preserve them from present ruine. Which being made evident to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, as also that in former times, even from the very first foundation thereof, it had been supported partly out of the large Oblations of those that visited the Shrines and Oratories therein, and partly from Publick Contributions in all parts of the Kingdom; It was concluded to proceed in the same way now, as had been done formerly. And that it might proceed the better, the King himself, and many of the principal Nobility and Gentry, declared by their Superscriptions (for the encouragement of others to so good a Work) what Sums they resolved to give in pursuance of it: Doctor <hi>Iohn King,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> subscribing for 100 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> as long as he should continue in that See. <hi>Mountain</hi> who succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not long after in that Bishoprick, procured with great charge and trouble some huge massie Stones to be brought from <hi>Portland,</hi> for the beginning of the Work: But money coming slowly in, and he

Some men in hope of favour and preferment from him, others to hold fair quarter with him, and not a few for fear of incurring his displeasure, contributing more largely to it than they had done otherwise; if otherwise they had contributed at all. Certain I am, that the Regular Clergy were so forward in it, that being called together by their several Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, few of them gave so little as a single tenth, many a double Subsidy, most in the middle betwixt both, to be paid in three, four, or five years, as the work continued. Which joyned together amounting to a liberal sum, not reckoning in the Deans and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whom it more nearly did concern to support that Fabrick than those of the Parochial Clergy.

For remedy whereof order was given to such as preached at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Cross, and other publick places both in City and Country, to represent unto their hearers all those several motives which might not only serve to justifie, but endear the work; nor wanted there some zealous Patriots (or such as were desirous to be so accounted) on the other side, who gave it out to be a cheat, a mear Court device to procure money for the King without help of Parliaments; which project if it might succeed, the King (said they) would grow too absolute,<note place="margin">

<q>That the work of Reparation should begin, but had caused an entrance to be made into it, and that he was constantly resolved to follow it till it was brought to perfection, whereof he required the Commissioners to satisfie all his loving Subjects of the clearness of his Royal Intention therein, and to assure them in his Name, that all rumours and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as of diverting the money to any other purpose, was but the fancies of men either grosly malevolent, or causelesly jealous and distrustful.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Subject being thus assured, the Clergy active, and the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity giving good example unto all the rest, the work was so followed by the care of this powerful Prelate, that before the year 1640. the whole body of it was finished, and the Tower or Steeple Scaffol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the very top, with an intent to take it down to the very Arches, and raise it to a more stately height than it had at the present, with four great Pinacles (at each Corner one) the Arches being thought unable to support the burthen of such a Steeple as before was fired.

Which <hi>Portico</hi> was intended to be an <hi>Ambulatory</hi> for such as by usual walking in the body of the Church prophaned the place, and disturbed the Divine Service in the Choire. And on the other side, Sir <hi>Paul Pindar</hi> Knight (sometime Embassador from King

                     <hi>Iames</hi> at <hi>Constantinople</hi>) first repaired the decaies of that goodly Partition, made at the West end of the Choire, adorning the outward Front thereof with fair Pillars of black Marble, and <hi>Statues</hi> of those <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings who had been Founders and Benefactors to that Church; beautified the inward part thereof with Figures of Angels, and all the Wainscoat work with Figures and Carving, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Cherubins,</hi> and other Images richly guilded; adding also fine sorts of hangings for the upper end thereof, and afterwards bestowed 4000 <hi>li.</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the South part of the <hi>Cross Isle.</hi> But as this Bishop fell, the work fell with him; the yearly Contribution abating in the year 1641. when he was plunged into his troubles, from 15000 <hi>li.</hi> and upward, to little more than 1500 <hi>li.</hi> and after by degrees to nothing, which clearly shews upon what Wheel the whole Engine moved, whose soul it was, which gave both life and motion to that great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign. A work of such a vast Magnificence as required a large and open heart, commensurate in some manner to the greatness of it; not to be entertained by a man of such <hi>narrow comprehensions,</hi> as were ascribed unto him in a Speech made by one of the Peers, when he first fell into his troubles. So easie a thing it is to disgrace the man whom the weight of his afflictions have once made uncapable of standing up against such reproaches as the Pens or Tongues of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilers shall accumulate on him.</p>
                  <p>Better success he had in another of his undertakings, though not of such a publick nature, or of so general a concernment to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Church and State. He had received his breeding and first Preferments in St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxon.</hi> which he resolved to gratifie for the charge of his Education, by adding a second Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangle unto that of the first Foundation. The other great work he carried on by the publick Purse, contributing little more unto it (besides his annual pension of 100 <hi>li.</hi>) but his power and diligence. But this he means to carry on at his own proper Costs, his Majesty most graciously contributing some timber towards it out of <hi>Shot-over</hi> woods, of which the Lord <hi>Treasurer</hi> endeavoured (but in vain endeavoured) to have made a stop. Some Benefactor had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enricht the Colledge with a Publick Library, which made one side to his new Building, the other three he added to it of his own. That on the North consisted altogether of several Chambers, for the accommodations of the Fellows and other Students. That on the East of a fair open walk below, supported upon curious Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and bearing up a beautiful Gallery, opening out of the Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for meditation and discourse: confronted on the other side with the like open walk below, and a sutable Fabrick over that raised up against the Eastern wall of the Ancient Buildings. The whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure fashioned in an excellent Symetry according to the exactest rules of Modern <hi>Architecture</hi>; not only graceful in it self, and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to that private house, but a great ornament also to the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. St. <hi>Iohns</hi> in <hi>Cambridge</hi> shall boast no longer of its precedency

before this in a double Quadrangle; In which it stands equalled at the least, if not surmounted also by this of <hi>Oxford.</hi> On the twenty third of <hi>Iuly,</hi> in this present year, he laid the first stone of this new building, not intermitting it (but only during the unseasonableness of the following Winters) till he had brought it to an end, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his first design and proposition. Nor did these publick build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings take him off in the least degree from doing the Office of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. His eye was alwaies watchfull over the Churches peace. And to preserve his own Diocess both in peace and order, he bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this year a personal Visitation on it; beginning at <hi>Brentwood</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> on the thirtieth of <hi>August,</hi> and so went on from place to place, till he had visited and regulated the whole Clergy of it in their several Deanries, and Precincts. And for performing of that Office he laid aside the dignity of a Privy Counsellor, and his attendance on the person of his gracious Soveraign, in being an example of a careful and prudent Pastor to the rest of his brethren.</p>
                  <p>In the late Agitations at <hi>Woodstock</hi> before the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he let fall some words, which were interpreted to the disparagement of the married Clergy.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.7.</note> He was a single man himself, and wisht perhaps as St. <hi>Paul</hi> once did, That all men else (that is to say, all men in <hi>holy Orders</hi>) would remain so likewise. And some occasion being offered at that time to speak about the conveniencies or inconveniencies of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Clergy, he made some declaration of himself to this effect, that in disposing of all Ecclesiastical Promotions he would prefer the single man before the married, supposing the abilities of the persons were otherwise equal; which limitation notwithstanding it gave much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of discourse, and not a little ground of scandal to many very honest and well-minded men, who began presently to fear the sad conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of it. This general murmur could not but come unto his ears, and found him very sensible of the Inconveniencies which might grow upon it. For he soon wiped off that reproach, by nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating a Marriage between Mr <hi>Thomas Turner,</hi> one of his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, and a Daughter of <hi>Windebanke</hi> his old friend, (at whose house he had so long lain sick, as before is said.) And that the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this point might appear the greater, he officiated the whole Service of their Marriage in his own Chappel at <hi>London</hi> House, joyning their hands, and giving the Nuptial Benediction, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming all other Ecclesiastical Rites which belonged to the solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of Matrimony by the Rules of this Church. This was the answer which he made to his own Objection, and indeed it was so full and home, that the Objection seemed not to require any further answer. Nor was it long before <hi>Windebanke</hi> found how well his chearfulness in yielding to that Match had been entertained. He was at that time one of the Clerks of the <hi>Signet,</hi> as his Father Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Windebanke</hi> had been before him: But our Bishop did not mean he should dwell there alwaies. They had been Cotemporaries at St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Colledge, their acquaintance from their very Childhood,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54785:115"/>
their persons much of the same stature; a like facetiousness in both for wit and company. In which respects <hi>Laud</hi> had commended him to the good Graces of the Duke when he was alive. But the Duke doing nothing for him, left <hi>Laud</hi> in a capacity to supply the want; by whose power and favour with the King he was advanced unto the honourable Office of the principal Secretary of State, in the place of <hi>Dudly</hi> Lord <hi>Carlton</hi> Viscount <hi>Dorchester. Dorchester</hi> died on <hi>Ash-Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesday</hi> Morning, <hi>Anno</hi> 1631. And of <hi>Windebanke</hi> he writes thus in his <hi>Breviate,</hi> viz. <hi>Iune</hi> 15. 1632., <hi>Mr.</hi> Francis Windebanke <hi>my old friend was sworn Secretary of State, which Place I obtained for him of my gracious Master King</hi> Charles.</p>
                  <p>About the same time also Sir <hi>Francis Cottington,</hi> who succeeded the Lord Treasurer <hi>Weston</hi> in the place of Chancellor, was made Successor unto <hi>Nanton</hi> in the Mastership of the Wards and Liveries. No sooner was he in this place, but some difference began to grow betwixt him and <hi>Coventry,</hi> Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> about the disposing of such Benefices as belonged to the King, in the Minority of his <hi>Wards: Coventry</hi> pleaded a joynt interest in it according to the Priviledge and usage of his Predecessors, it stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing formerly for a rule, that he of the two which first heard of the vacancy, and presented his Clerk unto the Bishop, should have his turn served before the other. But <hi>Cottington</hi> was resolved to have no Competitor, and would have either all or none. During which Competition betwixt the parties, <hi>Laud</hi> ends the difference by taking all unto himself. Many Divines had served as Chaplains in his Majesties Ships, and ventured their persons in the Action at the Isle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> during his Majesties late engagements with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>; some reward must be given them for their Service past, the better to encourage others on the like occasions for the time to come. It is cold venturing in such hot Services without some hope of Reward. And thereupon he takes occasion to inform his Majesty, that till this Controversie were decided he might do well to take those Livings into his own disposing for the reward of such Divines as had done him service in his Wars, or should go forth hereafter on the like imployments. Which Proposition being approved, his Majesty committed the said Benefices unto his disposal, knowing full well how faithfully he would discharge the trust reposed in him for the advancement of his Majesties Service, the satisfaction of the Suitors, and the Churches peace. Neither did <hi>Cottington</hi> seem dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased at this designation: As being more willing that a third man should carry away the prize from both, than to be overtopt by <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry</hi> in his own Jurisdiction. By the accession of this power as he encreased the number of his dependents, so he gained the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by it to supply the Church with regular and conformable men, for whom he was to be responsal both to God and the King. Which served him for a Counter-Ballance against the multitude of Lecturers established in so many places, especially by the <hi>Feoffees</hi> for impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54785:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who came not to their doom till <hi>February</hi> 13. of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent year, as before was said.</p>
                  <p>But greater were the Alterations amongst the Bishops in the Church than amongst the Officers of Court, and greater his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in preferring the one than in disposing of the other. <hi>Buckeridge</hi> his old Tutor, dying in the See of <hi>Elie,</hi> makes room for <hi>White,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and Lord <hi>Almoner,</hi> to succeed in his place; A man who having spent the greatest part of his life on his private Cures, grew suddenly into esteem by his zealous preachings against the <hi>Papists,</hi> his Conferences with the Jesuite <hi>Fisher,</hi> and his Book wrote against him by command of King <hi>Iames.</hi> Appointed by that King to have a special eye on the Countess of <hi>Denbigh</hi> (whom the Priests much laboured to pervert) he was encouraged thereunto with the Deanry of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> advanced on that very account to the Bishoprick thereof by the Duke her brother. The Duke being dead, his favour in the Court continued, remove to <hi>Norwich</hi> first and to <hi>Ely</hi> afterwards. <hi>Corbet</hi> of <hi>Oxon.</hi> one of <hi>Lauds</hi> fellow-sufferers in the University, succeeds him in the See of <hi>Norwich</hi>; and <hi>Bancroft,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of <hi>Vniversity Colledge,</hi> is made Bishop of <hi>Oxon.</hi> Kinsman he was to ever renowned Archbishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> by whom preferred unto that Headship, and looked upon for his sake chiefly, though otherwise of a good secular living in this Succession. The Bishoprick of small Revenue, and without a House, but <hi>Laud</hi> will find a remedy for both in convenient time. The Impropriate Parsonage of <hi>Cudesdens</hi> five miles from <hi>Oxon.</hi> belonged to the Bishop in the right of his See, and he had the Donation of the Vicaridge in the same right also. The Impropriation was in Lease, but he is desired to run it out without more renewing, that in the end it might be made an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement to that slender Bishoprick. The Vicaridge in the mean time falling, he procured himself to be legally instituted and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and by the power and favour of our Bishop of <hi>London</hi> obtains an annexation of it to the See Episcopal, (the design of bringing in the impropriation going forwards still) and builds that beautiful house upon it, which before we mentioned. The See of <hi>Bristow</hi> was grown poorer than that of <hi>Oxon.</hi> both having been dilapidated in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, though by divers hands. To improve the Patrimony thereof, his Majesty had taken order, that <hi>Wright,</hi> then Bishop of that Church, should suspend the renewing of a Lease of a very good Farm, not very far distant from that City, well Housed, and of a competent Revenue, to serve as a Demesn to the following Bishops; for which he was to be considered in some other Preferment. <hi>Houson</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> being dead, <hi>Morton</hi> removes from <hi>Lichfield</hi> thither, A man who for the greatest part of his time had exercised his Pen against the <hi>Papists</hi>: but gave withall no small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to King <hi>Iames,</hi> by his learned Book in defence of the three harmless <hi>Ceremonies</hi> against the <hi>Puritans.

                  <p>Nor were these all the Alterations which were made this year; Archbishop <hi>Harsnet</hi> having left his life the year before, care must be taken for a sit man to succeed at <hi>York</hi>; a man of an unsuspected trust, and one that must be able to direct himself in all emergencies. <hi>Neiles</hi> known sufficiencies had pointed him unto the place, but he was warm at <hi>Winton,</hi> and perhaps might not be perswaded to move toward the North, from whence he came not long before with so great contentment; Yet such was the good mans desires to serve his Majesty, and the Church in what place soever, though to his personal trouble and particular loss; that he accepted of the offer, and was accordingly translated in the beginning of this year, or the end of the former. Two Offices fell void by this remove, one in the Court, which was the Clerkship of the Closet: and another in the Church of <hi>Winton,</hi> which was that of the Bishop. To the Clerkship of the Closet he preferred Dr. <hi>William Iuxon,</hi> (whom before he had made President of St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Colledge) and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to his Majesty for the Deanry of <hi>Worcester,</hi> to the end that he might have some trusty friend to be near his Majesty, whensoever he was forced by sickness, or any other necessary occasion, to absent himself. So that <hi>Windebanke</hi> having the Kings ear on one side, and the Clerke of the Closet on the other, he might presume to have his tale well told between them; and that his Majesty should not easily be possessed with any thing to his disadvantage. To find ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sit man for <hi>Winton</hi> must be his chief business, whom it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to plant such a Bishop in that See as might be pliant and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient unto his desires. The Bishop of <hi>Winton</hi> by his place is Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor of five considerable Colledges in the University of <hi>Oxon.</hi> that is to say, <hi>Magdalens, New Colledge, Corpus Christi,</hi> St. <hi>Iohns,</hi> and <hi>Trinity</hi>; by which means he is able to draw a great party after him, and such as might much curb the power of the Chancellor if they should cross with one another. Therefore to make sure work at <hi>Oxford</hi> he thought it most conducible to his peace and power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Curle</hi> from <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> to the See of <hi>Winton,</hi> which being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly effected, <hi>Pierce</hi> is removed from <hi>Peterborough</hi> to the Church of <hi>Wells,</hi> upon the like consideration as <hi>Wright</hi> about the same time was translated to <hi>Lichfield.</hi> There was a rich Parsonage, called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,</hi> which belonged to his Patronage as Bishop of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> about three or four miles from that small City, designed whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it fell void to serve for a perpetual <hi>commendam</hi> to the Bishops of it. And falling void, it was so ordered by the care of our Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> that <hi>Pierce</hi> should wave the preferment of a friend unto
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54785:117"/>
it, and take it for the present unto himself, leaving it afterwards to his Successors. For his Reward therein he was preferred to <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and <hi>Peterborough</hi> procured by <hi>Laud</hi> for his old Friend and Fellow-Servant Doctor <hi>Augustine Lyndsell,</hi> for whom he formerly had obtained the Deanry of <hi>Litchfeild</hi>: And to say truth, the man deserved it, being a very solid Divine, and a learned Linguist, to whom the Christian World remains indebted for <hi>Theophylact</hi>'s Comment on the Epistles, and the <hi>Catena</hi> upon <hi>Iob,</hi> published by him in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Majesties Printers, at or about this time, had committed a scandalous mistake in our <hi>English</hi> Bibles, by leaving out the word <hi>Not</hi> in the Seventh Commandment. His Majesty being made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it by the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> Order was given for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Printers into the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> where upon Evidence of the Fact, the whole Impression was called in, and the Printers deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fined, as they justly merited. With some part of this Fine <hi>Laud</hi> causeth a fair Greek Character to be provided, for publishing such Manuscripts as Time and Industry should make ready for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick view; of which sort were the <hi>Catena</hi> and <hi>Theophylact</hi> set out by <hi>Lyndsell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This mentioning of the <hi>High-Commission</hi> conducts me toward the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> where we shall find a Censure passed on <hi>Sherfeild</hi> the Recorder of <hi>Sarum,</hi> wherein our Bishop was as active as in that before; which because it drew upon him some clamour, and such a clamour as not only followed him to his death, but hath been since continued in sundry Pamphlets, I shall lay down the occasion of it, and the true Reasons of his Earnestness and Zeal in that prosecution. This <hi>Sherfeild</hi> being Recorder of <hi>Sarum,</hi> as before is said, was one of the Parishioners of the Parish Church of St. <hi>Edmonds,</hi> in one of the Windows whereof the Story of the Creation was express'd in old painted Glass, in which there was a Representation of God the Father in the shape of an Old Man, after which form the Painters of those Elder Times did most commonly draw him. This Window, which had continued in the Church without any offence from the first setting of it up, till the year 1629. or thereabouts, became a great eyesore to this man, whom nothing would content but the defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of those Pictures, in such a way as might best please his own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and affront Authority. <hi>Davenant</hi> at that time was Bishop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> and lived for the most part in his Palace there; a man of known disaffections to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the Superstitious Vanities and Corruptions of it. Had he been made acquainted with it, there is no question to be made, but that he either would have gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the man, in causing the said window to be taken down in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way; or else have given him such good Reasons to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as might have qualified the peccancy of the present Humour. But <hi>Sherfeild</hi> being the Recorder, and thinking he had the Law in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ands, as well as he had it in his head, must go another way to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54785:117"/>
work, and bring the Business to be agitated in a Parish <hi>Vestry,</hi> which <hi>Bastard Elderships</hi> began to grow so much in use in most Corporate Towns, that countenance and connivence in short time would have made them Legitimate. The <hi>Elders</hi> of the <hi>Vestry</hi> being as willing to embrace the business, as he was to commend it to them, enabled him at the next <hi>Church-Session,</hi> in the Month of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1629. to ease his Conscience of that burthen, by taking down the offensive Window, and setting up another of plain white Glass in the place therereof: And yet this gave him no content, unless he might shew a more than ordinary Zeal, in defacing those Images which he was ordered to take down; and did accordingly deface them, beating down the Pictures with his Staff in such a violent and scandalous way, as was disrelished by most moderate men of his own Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The noise of so foul a misdemeanour growing lowder and lowder, it came at last unto the Court; whereupon an Information was exhibited against him in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> by the Kings Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, not ripened for a Hearing till the latter end of this present year, and then brought to Sentence. The Affront done to the <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan,</hi> and the erecting of a new <hi>Eldership</hi> in despite of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, had been crime sufficient to bring him under the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the <hi>High-Commission</hi>: But taking power unto himself of Reforming what he thought amiss in the face of the Church, and proceeding to the execution of it in a way so dangerous, so full of ill example to the rest of the Zealots, made him more properly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Court of <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and to as heavy a Censure there as that Court could legally inflict for the like Disorders. For what Security could be hoped for in Church or State, if every man should be a <hi>Sherfeild,</hi> and without asking leave of the Prince or Prelate, proceed to such a Reformation as best pleased his Phansie? If suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go on in defacing Windows, they would be spirited in short time to pull down Churches; there being commonly no stop in such Tumultuary Reformations, till every man be wearied in his own confusions. And somewhat there was also in it which was looked upon as a great discouragement to the moderate <hi>Papists,</hi> from thinking favourably of our Churches, or resorting to them; and to some moderate <hi>Protestants</hi> also, in beautifying and adorning Churches after such a manner, as without giving just offence, might draw the greater Estimation to those sacred Places. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, <hi>Laud</hi> did not only aggravate the Crime as much as he could, in reference to the dangerous Consequences which might follow on it: but shewed how far the use of painted Images, in the way of Ornament and Remembrance, might be retained in the Church; not justifying the painting of God the Father in the shape of an Old Man (as he was commonly misreported) but only laying down the Reason which induced some Painters to that Representation, which they grounded on <hi>Daniel</hi> 7.9. where God the Father is not only cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Ancient of Days,</hi> to signifie his Eternity before all time (which
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54785:118"/>
was so much insisted on by the Earl of <hi>Dorset</hi>) but described after the similitude of an Old Man, <hi>the hair of whose head was like the pure wooll.</hi> In fine, though <hi>Sherfeild</hi> found some Friends, yet they were but few, the major part concurring in this Sentence on him, that is to say, to be fined a thousand pounds to the King, deprived of his Recordership, bound to his good behaviour for the time to come, as also to make a publick Acknowledgment of his Offence, not only in the Parish Church of St. <hi>Edmonds,</hi> where it was committed; but in the Cathedral Church it self; that the Bishop, in contempt of whose Authority he had plaid this <hi>Pageant,</hi> might have Reparation.</p>
                  <p>This Censure being past on <hi>Sherfeild</hi> on the eighth of <hi>February,</hi> Order is given to <hi>Noy</hi> the Atturney-General to make preparation for another, but of greater consequence. We shew'd before how bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie <hi>Prynne</hi> had made himself in some present Controversies, and with what insolence he carried himself from the <hi>High-Commission.</hi> Prepared with confidence and success for a further Calamity, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes a small Pamphlet called <hi>Lame GILES his Halting,</hi> An <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix</hi> against <hi>Bowing at the Name of IESVS,</hi> a larger Book called <hi>Anti-Arminianism,</hi> and notably bestirs himself in discovering a mistake (an <hi>Imposture</hi> it must needs be called) in the <hi>Historical Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> published 1631. against which he never lest exclaiming, till he had procured Archbishop <hi>Abbot</hi> (with whom he was grown very gracious) to call it in: But not contented with that Triumph, he prepares another <hi>Pageant</hi> for us in the end of <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term this year, known by the name of <hi>Histrio-Mastyx,</hi> in which he seemed to breath nothing but Disgrace to the Nation, Infamy to the Church, Reproaches to the Court, Dishonour to the Queen, and some things which were thought to be tending to the destruction of his Majesties Person. Neither the Hospitality of the Gentry in the time of <hi>Christmas,</hi> nor the Musick in Cathedrals and the Chappels Royal, nor the Pomps and Gallantries of the Court, nor the Queens harmless Recreations, nor the Kings solacing himself sometimes in Masques and Dances, could escape the venom of his Pen; expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for the most part in such bitter Language, and frequently inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced with such dangerous Aggravations and Insinuations, that it was not possible for the Author to escape uncensured. This Book being brought before the Lords of the Council toward the end of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and found too tedious for their Lordships to be troubled with it, it pleased his Majesty to give order, that the Book should be committed to the Reading of one of the <hi>Prebends</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> with command to draw out of it and digest such particular Passages as tended to the danger or dishonour of the King or State. On the finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and return of which Collection, <hi>Prynne</hi> is committed to the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on <hi>Sunday</hi> being <hi>Candlemas</hi> day, and on the morrow after the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector received a further Order to review his Notes, and deduct out of them such Logical Inferences and Conclusions as might and did na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally arise on those dangerous Premises: One Copy of the same to be

                        <hi>Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates Tryal,</hi> p. 129.</note> 
                     <hi>Prynne</hi> himself informed against him to the House of Commons. What was done further in this business, we shall see hereafter.</p>
                  <p>This business being put into a course, our Bishop offereth some Considerations to the Lords of the Council, concerning the Dishonour done to the Church of <hi>England</hi> by the wilful ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence of some Chaplains and other Ministers, both in our Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Regiments beyond the Seas; together with the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which redounded to it from the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons settled in many places amongst our selves. He had long <hi>teemed</hi> with this Design, but was not willing to be his own <hi>Midwife</hi> when it came to the <hi>Birth</hi>; and therefore it was so contrived, that <hi>Winde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank</hi> should make the Proposition at the Council-Table, and put the Business on so far, that the Bishop might be moved by the whole Board to consider of the several Points in that weighty Business: who being thus warranted to the execution of his own desires, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented two <hi>Memorials</hi> to their Lordships, at the end of this year, <hi>March</hi> 22. The one relating to the Factories and Regiments beyond the Seas; the other to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Plantations in <hi>London, Kent, Norfolk, Yorkshire, Hampshire,</hi> and the Isle of <hi>Axhelme.</hi> He had observed, not without great indignation, how Tenacious the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches were of their own received Forms, both in Worship and Government; as on the other side, how ignoble and degenerous the <hi>English</hi> had shown themselves, in neglecting the Divine Service of this Church in their several Factories, where they were licenced to make use of it by the Power and Countenance of that State in which they Traded. The Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> being sent this year to negotiate some Affairs with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strother</hi> ready to come from the Court of the Emperour, they were appointed by his Majesty to meet at <hi>Hamborough,</hi> there to expect the coming of <hi>Pennington</hi> with some Ships to conduct them home. The <hi>English</hi> driving a great Trade in that Town, were by the Magistrates thereof indulged all the Priviledges of an <hi>English</hi> Church: but they retained nothing of a Church of <hi>England,</hi> governing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wholly by <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Plat-form, which they had taken up in <hi>England.</hi> The two Embassadors being met, but the Ships not come, the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church humbly desired their Lordships to do them so much honour in the eyes of the People, as to vouchsafe their presence at the <hi>English</hi> Church; and that their Lordships Chaplains might be ordered to Exercise in the Congregation. This Motion being chearfully embraced by both, the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi>'s Chaplain first mounts the Pulpit, and after a short Psalm, according to the <hi>Genevian</hi> fashion, betakes himself unto his Sermon. The
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54785:119"/>
like was done by <hi>Iohnson, Anstrothers</hi> Chaplain, (for I remember not the name of the other) when it came to his turn. The Ships be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, and staying for a change of wind, the like curtesie was desired of <hi>Pennington,</hi> Admiral of that little Fleet for the present Service. <hi>Pennington</hi> told them that he had no Chaplain, that there was in the Ship one Dr. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his Friend and Kinsman, who had borne him company in that Voyage; and that he doubted not but that he would readily hearken to them, if they made the motion. The motion being made and granted, <hi>Ambrose</hi> attends his Admiral to the place of Exercise, where he took up his stand very near the Pulpit. The Congregation being filled, and the Psalm half done, a <hi>Deacon</hi> is sent to put him in mind of going into the Pulpit; of whom he desires to be accommodated with a Bible, and a <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> Book; The <hi>Deacon</hi> offered him a Bible, but told him that they had no such thing as a <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> Book, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayers were not used amongst them: Why then, said <hi>Ambrose,</hi> the best is, that I have one of my own; which being presently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of his pocket, he began with the Sentences, and invitation, and was scarce entred into the Confession, when all the Church was in an uprore. The Elders thereupon in a great amaze sent back the <hi>Deacon,</hi> to desire him to go into the Pulpit, and not to trouble them with that which they were not used to. <hi>Ambrose</hi> replied, That if they were an <hi>English</hi> Church they were obliged to serve God by the English <hi>Liturgie</hi>; and that if they would have no Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they should have no Sermon, and so proceeded on with the rest of the Liturgy; which Message being delivered to the <hi>Elders,</hi> the <hi>Deacon</hi> was sent back the third time, requiring him to desist from that unnecessary Service. On the receiving of which Message he puts the book into his pocket, and goes out of the Church, the two Embassadours following him, and the Admiral them; to the great honour of himself, and the confusion of <hi>Iohnson</hi> (from whose mouth I received the story) and the other Chaplain, being thus shewed their errour in not doing the like.</p>
                  <p>That our Bishop was ever made acquainted by the said <hi>Iohnson</hi> with this passage, I am not able to say; but whether he were or not, he had too much ground for what he did, in offering to their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships his considerations for regulating Divine Service in that and all other Factories, Imployments, and Commands of the English Nation. That is to say,
<q>First, That the Colonels of the English Regiments in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> should entertain no Minister as Preacher to their Regiments but such as should conform in all things to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be commended to them by their Lordships, the Advice of the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York</hi> being taken in it. Secondly, That the Company of Merchants there residing, or in any other parts, shall admit no Minister as Preacher to them but such as are so qualified, and so commended, as a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oresaid. Thirdly, That if any Minister hath gotten himself by
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:54785:119"/>
indirect means to be so commended, and should be afterwards found to be unconformable, and should not conform himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three months, upon warning giving him by the said Colonels or Deputy Governour of the Factors under whom he liveth, he shall be dismist from his imployment, and a more orderly man recommended to it. Fourthly, That every Minister or Chaplain in any Factory, or Regiment, whether of <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Scots,</hi> shall read the Common Prayers, Administer the Sacraments, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chise the Children, and perform all other publick Ministerial du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, according to the Rules or <hi>Rubricks</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> Liturgie, and not otherwise. Fifthly, That if any Minister or Preacher, being the Kings born Subject, should with any bitter words, or writings, in Print or otherwise, defame the Church of <hi>England</hi> by Law established, notice thereof is to be given to the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor there, and by him to this State, by whom the party so offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should be commanded over again to answer for his said offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the like to be done also in derogating from the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church, and in Preaching, Writing or Printing any thing prejudicial to the Temporal State and Government of the Realm of <hi>England.</hi> Sixthly, That no Colonel or Deputy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour should permit their Minister or Preacher, in the case of sickness, or necessary absence, to bring in any to preach or officiate for him, but such an one for whose conformity he would be accountable. Seventhly, That no Deputy Governours should be sent to <hi>Delfe,</hi> or any other place of Residence for the <hi>English</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, but one that, being conformable to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> both in Doctrine and Discipline, would take care also, that such as be under him, shall perform all Church duties before expressed; that the party so designed shall be presented to their Lordships by the Merchant <hi>Adventurers,</hi> giving assurance of his fitness and sufficiency for that charge, and that some of the chief of the Merchants be sent for to the board, and made acquainted with this order. Eightly, That as often as the said Merchants shall renew their Patents, a clause for the due observation of these Instructions (or so many of them at the least as should seem necessary to their Lordships) to be inserted in the same. Ninthly, That all his Majesties Agents there from time to time have these Instructions given them in Charge, and that once a year they be required to give the Board an account of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of the business, that further order might be taken if occasion be. Tenthly, That the <hi>English</hi> Ministers in <hi>Holland,</hi> being his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties born Subjects, be not suffered to hold any <hi>Classical</hi> meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but howsoever not to assume the power of <hi>Ordination</hi>; from which if they should not be restrained, there would be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Seminary for breeding up men in Schism and Faction, to the disturbance of this Kingdom.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In reference to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches here in <hi>England</hi> he
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54785:120"/>
proceeded in another method; first, representing the occasion of their settling here, their several abuses of that Favour, together with the manifold dangers and inconveniencies which might thence arise; and next advising such agreeable remedies as he thought most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the cure.
<q>And first he represented to them the great piety of this State in giving liberty to those Nations to enjoy the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their own Religion, at <hi>London</hi> and elsewhere in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; when being under persecution in their own Countries they could not enjoy the same at home. Secondly, That it was not the meaning of this State then, or at any other time since, that the first Generation being worn out, their Children, and Childrens Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, being naturally born Subjects of this Realm, should still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main divided from the rest of the Church, which must needs ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enate them from the State, and make them apt to any innovation which may sort better with their humour: Thirdly, That they still keep themselves as a distinct body of themselves, marrying only in their own Tribe with one another; by means whereof it must needs follow, that as they are now a Church within a Church, so in short time they might grow to be a Common-wealth in the middest of a Kingdom. Fourthly, That these bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies standing thus divided from the Church and State are planted for the most part in such Haven Towns as lay fittest for <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi>; which may be a shrewd temptation to them to take such advantages to themselves, or to make use thereof for others as occasion offereth. Fifthly, That the example is of ill consequence in Church-affairs to the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> many being confirmed by it in their stubborn waies, and inconformities, but in <hi>London</hi> chiefly. Sixthly, That neither <hi>French</hi> nor <hi>Dutch</hi> Church be longer tolerated in this Kingdom than the Subjects of this Kingdom be suffered to enjoy the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in those several parts beyond the Seas where they have their abode.</q>
The dangers and inconveniencies being thus laid down, he proceeds to the Remedies. And first he doth advise,
<q>That the number of them in all places of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be fully known, to the end a better Judgment might be made of the way by which they are to be reduced to the rest of the Kingdom. Secondly, That a Command be issued to this purpose from the State it self, and that it be avowedly (and not perfun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorily) taken in all places where they do reside, and a Certificate returned of the men of most credit and wealth amongst them. Thirdly, That if they will continue as a distinct body both from State and Church, they should pay all duties double as strangers used to do in this Realm, and not be capable of such immunities as the Natives have, as long as they continue so divided from them. Fourthly, That when it shall be thought convenient to reduce them to the same condition with the rest of the Subjects, they should then be warned in an Ecclesiastical way (excepting
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:54785:120"/>
such as be new Commers) to repair diligently to their Parish Churches, and to conform themselves to their Prayers and <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>; which if they should refuse to do, then to proceed against them by Excommunication, and so unto the Writ <hi>de Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato capiendo,</hi> for a terror to others. Fifthly, and lastly, That if this course prevaile not with them, a Declaration to be made by the State to this effect, That if they will be as natives, and take the benefit of Subjects they must conform themselves to the Laws of the Kingdom, as well Ecclesiastical as Temporal; That being the likeliest way to make them capable of the inconveniencies they should run unto by their refusal and perverseness.</q>
Such were the considerations offered by him to the Lords of the Council, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the peace and honour of this Church both at home, and abroad. But long it will not be before we shall behold him sitting in the Chair of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> acting his own counsels, bringing these <hi>Conceptions</hi> to the <hi>birth,</hi> and putting the design into execution, of which more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>These matters standing in this state,<note place="margin">1633.</note> we must at last look toward <hi>Scotland;</hi> for the receiving of which Crown his Majesty and the Court prepare the beginning of this year. But besides the Pomp and Splendor of a Coronation, which the people with great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity had long prest upon him, there were some other <hi>Loadstones</hi> which made the <hi>Needle</hi> of his <hi>Compass</hi> point so much to the <hi>North.</hi> Concerning which the Reader may be pleased to know, that at the first Alteration of Religion in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> petitioning for aide from Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to expell the <hi>French,</hi>

But as <hi>Presbytery</hi> prevailed, so the Liturgie sell: the fancy of <hi>Extemporary</hi> Prayers growing up so fast in the minority of King <hi>Iames,</hi> that it soon thrust all Publick Forms out of use and credit. In which confused estate it stood till the coming of that King to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> where he much pleased himself with the Sobriety and Piety of the publick <hi>Liturgie.</hi> This made him cast his eyes more sadly on the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where for want of some such publick <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Prayers</hi> the Ministers prayed so ignorantly, that it was a shame to all Religion to have God spoke to in that barbarous manner, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so seditiously that their Prayers were plain Libells against Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or stuft with lies made up of all the false reports in the Kingdom. For remedy whereof, after he had restored, and settled
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54785:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Government, he procured the <hi>General Assembly</hi> of that <hi>Kirk,</hi> held at <hi>Aberdeen, Anno</hi> 1616. to pass an Act for Authorising some of the Bishops, and divers others, to compile a Publick <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie</hi> for the use of that <hi>Kirk</hi>; which being presented unto the King, and by him approved, should be universally received over all the Kingdom. To prepare the way unto them, his Majesty gave order the next Spring after, That the <hi>English Liturgie</hi> should be Officiated day by day in his Chappel-Royal in the City of <hi>Edenborough</hi>; and in the year following 1618. obtained the five Articles before-mentioned (as so many chief Ingredients for the Common-Prayer-Book) to be passed at <hi>Perth</hi>: by which Encouragements, the Commissioners which were appointed to compile the Book, went so luckily forwards, that it was not long before they brought it to an end, and sent it to King <hi>Iames</hi> by Archbishop <hi>Spotswood</hi>; who not only carefully perused every Passage in it, but caused it to be revised by some of the Bishops of that Kingdom, which were then in <hi>England,</hi> in whose Judgments he repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed especial confidence. Fitted according to his mind, he sent it back again to those from whose hands he received it, to be by them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the use of the Church; which undoubtedly had took effect, if the Breach with <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Death of that King, which followed not long after, had not unfortunately interrupted the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of the business.</p>
                  <p>In this condition of Affairs King <hi>Charles</hi> succeeded in the Crown, ingaged in a War with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and standing upon no good terms with his People at home; so that the business of the <hi>Liturgie</hi> seemed to be laid asleep, if not quite extinct. But in the year 1629. having agreed his differences with the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and being in a good way towards an Accommodation with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Scottish</hi> Bishops were again remembred of their Duty in it, who dispatch'd <hi>Maxwell,</hi> then one of the Preachers of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> to the Court about it: <hi>Maxwell</hi> applying himself to <hi>Laud,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> from whom he received this positive Answer, <hi>That if his Majesty would have a</hi> Liturgie <hi>setled there,</hi>

                     <hi>different from what they had already, it was best to take the</hi> English Liturgie, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any variation from it; that so the same</hi> Service-Book <hi>might pass through all his Majesties Dominions.

in them, than Relations made upon the <hi>post-fact</hi> for particular ends; take here this short Remembrance in one of his Letters to the Earl of <hi>Traquaire,</hi> dated <hi>September</hi> 11. 1637. where we find this Passage: <hi>And since</hi> (saith he) <hi>I hear from others, That some exception is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, because there is more in that</hi> Liturgie <hi>in some few particulars,</hi>

                     <hi>than is in the</hi> Liturgie <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>Why did they not admit the</hi> Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie <hi>of</hi> England <hi>without more ado? But by their refusal of that, and the dislike of this, 'tis more than manifest they would have neither, and perhaps none at all, were they left to themselves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But besides this, there was another Invitation which wrought much upon him in order to the present Journey: At his first coming to the Crown, the great Engagements then upon him, want of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply from <hi>England,</hi> and small help from <hi>Scotland,</hi> forced him to have recourse to such other ways of assistances as were offered to him; of which this was one. In the Minority of King <hi>Iames,</hi> the Lands of all Cathedral Churches and Religious Houses which had been setled on the Crown by Act of Parliament, were shared amongst the Lords and great men of that Kingdom (by the connivence of the Earl of <hi>Murrey,</hi> and some other of the Regents) to make them sure unto that side: And they being thus possessed of the same Lands, with the Regalities and Tythes belonging to those Ecclesiastical Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, Lorded it with Pride and Insolence enough in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Territories, holding the Clergy to small Stipends, and the poor <hi>Peasant</hi> under a miserable Vassalage and subjection to them, not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them to carry away their nine parts, till the Lord had carried off his Tenth; which many times was neglected out of pride and malice, those Tyrants not caring to lose their Tythe, so that the poor mans Crop might be left unto spoil and hazard. King <hi>Iames</hi> had once a purpose to revoke those Grants; but growing into years and troubles, he left the following of that Project to his Son and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor: Having but little help from thence to maintain his Wars, by the Advice of some of the Council of that Kingdom, he was put upon a course of resuming those Lands, Tythes, and Regalities into his own hand, to which the present Occupants could pretend no other Title than the unjust Usurpation of their Predecessors. This to effect, he resolves upon an Act of <hi>Revocation,</hi> Commissionating for that purpose the Earl of <hi>Annandale,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Maxwell</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Earl of <hi>Niddisdale</hi>) to hold a Parliament in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for Contribution of Money and Ships against the <hi>Duynkirkers</hi>; and arming <hi>Maxwell</hi> also with some secret Instructions for passing the said Act of <hi>Revocation,</hi> if he found it feasible. Being on the way as far as <hi>Barwick, Maxwell</hi> was there informed, That his chief errand being made known, had put all at <hi>Edenborough</hi> into Tumult; That a rich Coach which he had sent before to <hi>Dalkeith</hi> was cut in pieces, the poor Horses killed, the People seeming only sorry that they could not do so much to the Lord himself. Things being brought unto this stand, the King was put to a necessity of some second
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54785:122"/>
Counsels, amongst which none seemed more plausible and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to him, than that of Mr. <hi>Archibald Achison,</hi> who from a puisne Judge in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was made his Majesties <hi>Procurator</hi> or Solicitor-General in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi>; who having told his Majesty, <hi>That such as were Estated in the Lands in question, had served them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so well by the bare naming of an Act of</hi> Revocation, <hi>as to possess the People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (whom they found apt to be inflamed on such Suggestions), That the true intendment of that Act was to revoke all former Laws for suppressing of</hi> Popery, <hi>and settling the</hi> Reformed Religion <hi>in the Kirk of</hi> Scotland: <hi>And therefore, That it would be unsafe for his Majesty to proceed that way.</hi> Next he advised, <hi>That instead of such a General</hi> Revocation <hi>as the Act imported, a Commission should be issued out under the Great Seal of that Kingdom, for taking the</hi> Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries <hi>of all such</hi> Superiorities <hi>and</hi> Tythes <hi>within the Kingdom, at his Majesties Pleasure: And that such as should refuse to submit unto it, should be Impleaded one by one; to begin first with those whom he thought least able to stand out, or else most willing to conform to his Majesties Pleasure:</hi> Assuring him, <hi>That having the Laws upon his side, the Courts of Iustice must and would pass Iudgment for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King resolved upon this course, sends home the Gentleman, not only with Thanks and Knighthood (which he had most worthily deserved) but with Instructions and Power to proceed therein; and he proceeded in it so effectually to the Kings Advantage, that some of the impleaded Parties being cast in the Suit; and the rest seeing, that though they could raise the People against the King, they could not raise them against the <hi>LaWs,</hi> it was thought the best and safest way to compound the business. Hereupon, in the year 1630. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners are sent to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> and amongst others, the Learned and right Noble Lord of <hi>Marcheston</hi> (from whose mouth I had this whole Relation) who after a long Treaty with the King, did at last agree, That the said Commission should proceed as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; and, That all such <hi>Superiorities</hi> and <hi>Tythes</hi> as had been or should be surrendred, should be re-granted by the King on these Conditions: First, <hi>That all such as held Hereditary Sheriffdoms, or had the Power of Life and Death over such as lived within their Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, should quit those Royalties to the King.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That they should make unto their Tenants in their several Lands, some permanent Estates, either for their Lives, or one and twenty years, or some such like Term; that so the Tenants might be encouraged to Build and Plant, and improve the Patrimony of that Kingdom.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That some Provisions should be made for augmenting the Stipends of the Clergy.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>That they should double the yearly Rents which were reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto the Crown, by their former Grants.</hi> And finally, <hi>That these Conditions being performed on their parts, the King should settle their Estates by Act of Parliament.</hi> Home went the Commissioners with joy for their good success, expecting to be entertained with <hi>Bells</hi> and <hi>Bonfires:</hi> but they found the contrary; the proud <hi>Scots</hi> being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:54785:122"/>
resolved, rather to put all to hazard, than to quit that Power and Tyranny which they had over their poor <hi>Vassals,</hi> by which name (after the manner of the <hi>French</hi>) they called their Tenants. And hereunto they were encouraged under-hand by a Party in <hi>England,</hi> who feared that by this Agreement the King would be so absolute in those Northern Regions, that no Aid could be hoped from thence, when the necessity of their designs might most require it: Just as the <hi>Castilians</hi> were displeased with the Conquest of <hi>Portugal</hi> by King <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, because thereby they had no place left to retire unto, when either the Kings displeasure, or their disobedience, should make their own Country to hot for them.</p>
                  <p>Such was the face of Church and State when his Majesty began his Journey for <hi>Scotland</hi> to receive the Crown; a Journey of great expence on both sides, but of small profit unto either. On the thirteenth day of <hi>May</hi> he advanced toward the North; but by such leisurely Removes, that he recovered not the City of <hi>York</hi> till the twenty fourth, into which he made a Solemn and Magnificent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, attended by the Flower of the <hi>English</hi> Nobility, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Officers of his Court, and some of the Lords of his Privy Council. He was received at his first entrance into <hi>Scotland</hi> with a gallant body of that Nation, consisting for the most part of the like Ingredients, and so conducted into <hi>Edenborough</hi> on the tenth of <hi>Iune. Edenborough,</hi> the chief City of the Realm of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and indeed the <hi>Summa totalis</hi> of that Kingdom, extended a whole mile in length from the <hi>Palace-Royal</hi> of <hi>Holy-Rood</hi>-House, lying at the foot of the Hill, to a fair and ancient Castle mounted on the top thereof. From this Castle the King was to descend the Street in a Royal Pomp, till he came to his Palace (as the Kings of <hi>England</hi> commonly on the like occasion ride from the <hi>Tower</hi> thorow <hi>London</hi> to the Court of <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi>) where the Solemnities of the Coronation were to be perform'd. The day designed for it was the eighteenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> the concourse of People beyond expression, and the expressions of their Joy in gallantry of Apparel, sumptuous Feastings, and Acclamations of all sorts, nothing inferiour to that concourse. But this was only the <hi>Hosanna</hi> of his first Reception; they had a <hi>Crucifige</hi> for him when he came to his Parliament. It was conceived at his Majesties first going toward the <hi>North,</hi> that he would have settled the <hi>English Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie</hi> in that Church, at his being there: but he either carried no such thoughts with him, or, if he did, he kept them to himself as no more than thoughts, never discovering any such thing in his words or actions. The <hi>Scots</hi> were of another temper, than to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily won to any thing which they had no mind to; and a less mind they could have to nothing than the <hi>English Liturgie.</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> had taken order at his being in <hi>Scotland, Anno</hi> 1617. That it should constantly be read twice every day in his Chappel-Royal for that City; and gave command that the Lords of his Privy-Council, and the Lords of <hi>Session,</hi> should be present at it on the <hi>Sundays,</hi> and there
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54785:123"/>
receive the Holy Communion, according to the form prescribed in the Common-Prayer-Book: And this he did unto this end, That as well the Citizens of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> as such as came thither upon Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, might by degrees be made acquainted with the <hi>English</hi> Forms, and consequently be prepared for the receiving of such a <hi>Liturgie</hi> as the King, with the Advice of his Bishops, and other Learned Men (according to the Act of the <hi>Assembly</hi> at <hi>Aberdeen</hi>) should commend unto them: But these Directions being either discontinued, or carelesly followed after his decease, and the five Articles of <hi>Perth</hi> not press'd so diligently on the People as they might have been, the <hi>Scots</hi> were generally as great Strangers to the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as when King <hi>Iames</hi> first came amongst us.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty could not be so ill served, as not to be well enough informed how things went in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and therefore was not to venture rashly upon such a business, wherein he might receive a foil. He thereupon resolves to proceed no further in Matters which concerned the Church, than to pass an Act of <hi>Ratification,</hi> an Act Confirmatory of such Laws and Statutes, relating unto Church-concernments, as by King <hi>Iames</hi> had been obtained with great charge and cunning. And though he carried this Act at last, yet was it not without a far greater opposition than he had reason to expect from that <hi>Convention</hi>: But the Commission of <hi>Surrendry</hi> did so stick in their stomacks, that they could not chuse but vent their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affections on the first occasion. Nor would they suffer him to enjoy the benefit of that Act, so hardly gotten, with Peace and Honour; but followed him into <hi>England</hi> with a pestilent <hi>Libel,</hi> in which they charged him to have carried that Act by corrupting some, and a plain down-right buying of the Voices of others. This was the first taste which they gave the King of their malevolency towards his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Government; but it shall not prove to be the last. His Majesty had another business to effect at his being there, for which he needed not their Assistance, and for that reason did not ask it: This was the raising of the City of <hi>Edenborough</hi> to a See Episcopal, which before was only a Borough Town, belonging anciently to the Diocess and Jurisdiction of St. <hi>Andrews.</hi> The <hi>Metropolitan</hi> of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> was willing for the common good to yield unto this diminution of his Power and Profit; and that the whole County of <hi>Lothian,</hi> extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Edenborough-Fryth</hi> to the Town of <hi>Barwick,</hi> should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred from his own Diocess, to serve as a Diocess to this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of new Election. And on the other side, the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> whose Ancestors had long enjoyed the <hi>Priory</hi> of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> with a great part of the Lands belonging to it, was willing to let his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty have a good penyworth of some part of those Lands, to serve as a Patrimony to this new Episcopal See, and the Bishop of it: Which Provision being thus made and settled, <hi>Forbesse</hi> a right grave and solid Divine, is made the first Bishop of this City, his Cathedral
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:54785:123"/>
fixed in the Church of St. <hi>Giles</hi> (being the fairest in the Town), a Dean appointed for that Church, some Ministers of <hi>Edenborough</hi> and the Parts adjoining, being nominated for the <hi>Canons</hi> or <hi>Prebends</hi> of it. A design pious in it self, and purposely intended to inure the <hi>Edenburghers</hi> to the Fatherly Government of a Bishop, who by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering the exorbitancies of the Ministers there, might by degrees prepare the People to such impressions of Conformity as his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, by the Council and Consent of the rest of the Bishops, should graciously be pleased to imprint upon them. But such ill luck his Majesty had with that stubborn Nation, that this was look'd upon also as a general Grievance, and must be thought to aim at no other end than Tyranny and <hi>Popery,</hi> and what else they pleased.</p>
                  <p>We have almost done our work in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and yet hear nothing all this while of the Bishop of <hi>London</hi>; not that he did not go the Journey, but that there was little to be done at his being there, but to see and be seen: And yet it was a Journey which brought him some access of Honour, and gave him opportunity of making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self known to those of best Quality of that Kingdom. He had been in <hi>Scotland</hi> with King <hi>Iames</hi>; but then he waited only as a private Chaplain. He is now looked upon as the third Bishop of <hi>England</hi> in Place, and the greatest in Power; a <hi>Counsellor</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and the Kings great Favorite. He entred <hi>Scotland</hi> as a Privy-Counsellor of <hi>England</hi> only; but returned thence as a Counsellor for that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom also: to which Office he was sworn on the fifteenth of <hi>Iune.</hi> Nor did he shew himself less able in that Church, than in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-Chamber; being appointed by his Majesty to Preach before him on the last of that Month: in which some question may be made how he pleased the <hi>Scots,</hi> although it be out of question that he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the King. The greatest part of the following <hi>Iuly</hi> was spent in visiting the Country, and taking a view of the chief Cities, and most remarkable Parts and Places of it: Which having seen, he made a Posting Journey to the Queen at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> whither he came on <hi>Saturday</hi> the twentieth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> crossing the Water at <hi>Blackwall,</hi> and looking towards <hi>London</hi> from no nearer distance: But in this Act he laid aside the Majesty of his Predecessors, especially of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of Famous Memory, of whom it was observed, That she did very seldom end any of her <hi>Summer Progresses,</hi> but she would wheel about to some end of <hi>London,</hi> to make her passage to <hi>Whitehall</hi> thorow some part of the City; not only requiring the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, in their Scarlet Robes and Chains of Gold, to come forth to meet her: but the several Companies of the City to attend solemnly in their Formalities as she went along. By means whereof she did not only preserve that Majesty which did belong to a Queen of <hi>England</hi>; but kept the <hi>Citizens</hi> (and consequently all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) in a reverent Estimation and Opinion of her. She used the like Arts also in keeping up the Majesty of the Crown, and Service of the City, in the Reception and bringing in of Foreign <hi>Embassadors</hi>;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:54785:124"/>
who if they came to <hi>London</hi> by Water, were met at <hi>Gravesend</hi> by the Lord Mayor, the Aldermen, and Companies in their several Barges, and in that Solemn manner conducted unto such Stairs by the Water side, as were nearest to the Lodgings provided for them: But if they were to come by Land, they were met in the like sort at <hi>Shooters-Hill,</hi> by the Mayor and Aldermen, and thence conducted to their Lodgings, the Companies waiting in the Streets in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Habits. The like she used also in celebrating the <hi>Obsequies</hi> of all Christian Kings, whether <hi>Popish</hi> or <hi>Protestant,</hi> with whom she was in Correspondence; performed in such a Solemn and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent manner, that it preserved her in the estimation of all Foreign Princes, though differing in Religion from her, besides the great contentment which the People took in those Royal Pomps. Some other Arts she had of preserving Majesty, and keeping distance with her People; yet was so popular withal, when she saw her time, that never <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Popularity</hi> were so matched together. But these being laid aside by King <hi>Iames,</hi> who brooked neither of them; and not resumed by King <hi>Charles,</hi> who loved them not much more than his Father did; there followed first a neglect of their Persons, which <hi>Majesty</hi> would have made more Sacred; and afterwards a mislike of their Government, which a little <hi>Popularity</hi> would have made more grateful.</p>

By the first Character we find what made him acceptable amongst the Gentry; by the last, what made him grateful to the <hi>Puritan,</hi> in favour of which men he took so little care of the great Trust committed to him, and gave them so many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of increasing both in Power and Numbers, that to stop t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:54785:124"/>It is reported, That as Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> his Majesty, then Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> Archbishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> with many of the Nobility were waiting in the Privy Chamber for the coming out of King <hi>Iames</hi>; the Prince, to put a jest on the Duke his Brother, took the Archbishops Square Cap out of his hands, and put it on his Brothers head, telling him, that if he continued a good Boy, and followed his Book, he would one day make him Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Which the Child took in such disdain, that he threw the Cap upon the ground, and trampled it under his feet, not being without much difficulty and some force taken off from that eagerness. This though first it was not otherwise beheld than as an Act of Childish Passion, yet when his Brother Prince <hi>Henry</hi> died, and that he was Heir apparent to the Crown, it was taken up by many zealous Church-men for some ill presage unto the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of Bishops; the overthrow whereof by his Act and Power did seem to be fore-signified by it. But as their fears in that were groundless, so their conjectures were no better grounded than their fears, (there never being a greater Patron of the Episcopal order than he lived and died) but whether there might not be some presage in it in reference to the Archbishops person, the diminution of his Dignity and fall of his Power, may be best judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this suspension and the consequents which followed on it: And though he lived not long under the disgrace, yet in the interval of time he saw so much of his Authority devolved on <hi>Laud,</hi> that he grew more and more discontented, and was ready in a manner to have made himself the head of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction.</p>
                  <p>It is related by a late Writer, That towards his death he was not only discontented himself, but that his house was the Rendezvouz of all the Malecontents in Church and State, that he turned Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night to Noonday-by constant keeping of Candles lighted in his Chamber and Study; as also that such Visitants as repaired unto him called themselves <hi>Nicodemites,</hi> because of their secret coming to him by night. I know how much that Author hath been mistaken in other things, but I see nothing in this which may not be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with the truth of History. Certain I am, his Chaplains were successively declared <hi>Calvinians,</hi> his Secretary a professed Patron of the Puritan Faction, his doors continually open to the Chiefs of that party, and such as stickled in that cause; and amongst others to him by whose Suggestion (if we may take his own report) the <hi>Historical Narration</hi> was called in, for the great danger which it threatned to the grounds of <hi>Calvinism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For his compliance with the Gentry against the Clergie, this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is alledged from his own mouth,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>That he was so severe to the Clergy on purpose to rescue them from the severity of others, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the punishment of them by lay Iudges to their greater shames</hi>; which leaves the poor Clergy under a greater obloquy than any which their enemies had laid upon them. But the truer reason of it was, that having never been Parson, Vicar, nor Curate, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:54785:125"/>
ignorant of those afflictions which the Clergy do too often suffer by the pride of some, and the Avarice of others of their Country Neighbours, and consequently shewed the least compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards them when any of them had the hard fortune to be brought before him. And for his compliance with the <hi>Puritans</hi> against the Church this reason is alledged by others, <hi>viz.</hi> That he shewed the greater favour to them, to keep the ballance even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and the <hi>Papists</hi>; as <hi>Laud</hi> was thought to be indulgent to the Papists, the better to keep down the pride and prevalency of the Puritan Faction. But the truer reason of it was, That he had been alwaies inclinable to them from his first beginnings; insomuch that when he went <hi>Chaplain</hi> into <hi>Scotland</hi> with the Earl of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by King <hi>Iames</hi> in some negotiation about that Church) he was upon the point of betraying the cause, if <hi>Hodgskins,</hi> (afterwards one of the <hi>Residentiaries</hi> of <hi>York</hi>) who went Chaplain with him, had not preacquainted the Earl with his tergiversation.</p>
                  <p>And as he laboured to be Popular upon both accounts, so he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured a more particular correspondence with the Gentry of <hi>Kent,</hi> but most especially of his own Diocess. It had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the custom of his Predecessors to spend the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>est part of the long vacations in the Palace of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; met at the first entrance into the Diocess with a body of five hundred horse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting them to <hi>Canterbury</hi> with great love and duty; feasting the Gentry; relieving the poor City, entertaining their Tenants, and by them liberally furnished on the other side with all sorts of provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Abbot</hi> affected not this way, and therefore never bestowed any such visit upon his Diocess, but when he was confined to his house at <hi>Ford</hi> by the Kings appointment; and yet resolved upon a course which carried some equivalence with it towards his design. For once or twice in every year (and sometimes oftner) at the end of the term he would cause enquiry to be made in <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall, the common Rendezvouz in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, and the Royal Exchange, for all such Gentlemen of his Diocess as lodged in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> dispersing several Tickets from one to another, by which they were invited to a general entertainment at his house in <hi>Lambeth,</hi> the next day after the end of the present term, where he feasted them with great bounty and familiarity. A course as accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the <hi>Kentish</hi> Gentry as if he had kept open Hospitality in his Palace at <hi>Canterbury</hi>; because it saved them both the trouble of attending on him, and the charge of sending Presents to him, both which had been expected if he had spent any part of the year amongst them. But this he discontinued also for three or four years, or more, before his death, fearing (as his affairs then stood) that it might render him obnoxious to some misconstructions, which he was willing to avoid.</p>
                  <p>To bring his Story to an end, I shall say no more, but that he had his Birth at <hi>Guilford,</hi> the chief Town of <hi>Surrey,</hi> and the best part of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:54785:125"/>
his breeding in <hi>Baliol</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxon.</hi> whereof he was Fellow, and from thence preferred to be Master of <hi>Vniversity Colledge,</hi> and Dean of <hi>Winton.</hi> Other preferments he had none till he came to <hi>Lichfield,</hi> of which he was consecrated Bishop on the third of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, Anno</hi> 1609. from thence translated unto <hi>London</hi> within few Months after, and within twelve Months after that to the See of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Marks of his Benefaction we find none, in places of his Breeding, and Preferments; but a fair Hospital, well built, and liberally endowed in the place of his Birth. To which the woful man retired in the first extremity of those afflictions which his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune at <hi>Bramzill</hi> had drawn upon him; and to this place he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed his body whensoever it should please God to translate him out of the Church <hi>Militant</hi> to the Church <hi>Triumphant,</hi> which hapned on the fourth of <hi>August,</hi> as before was said.</p>

                     <q>That the Professors of it, they especially of greatest Worth, Learning and Authority, love Temper and Moderation; That the Doctrines are altered in many things; as for example, the Pope not <hi>Antichrist, Pictures, Free-will, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, Vniversal Grace, Inherent Righteousness, the preferring of Charity before Knowledge, the Merit (or Reward rather) of good Works</hi>; the 39 <hi>Articles</hi> seeming patient, if not ambitious also of some Catholick sense; That their Churches begin to look with a new face, their Walls to speak a new Language, and some of their Divines to teach, <hi>That the Church hath Authority in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Controversies of Faith, and interpreting the Scriptures</hi>; That men in talk and writing use willingly the once fearful names of <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Altars,</hi> and are now put in mind, That for Exposition of Scripture they are by Canon bound to follow the Fathers.</q>
So far the <hi>Iesuit</hi> may be thought to speak nothing but truth; but had he tarried there, he had been no <hi>Iesuit</hi>: And therefore to preserve the Credit of his Order, he must fly out further, and tell us this, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>That <hi>Protestantism</hi> waxeth weary of it self; That we are at this time more unresolved where to fasten, than in the infancy of our Church; That our Doctrine is altered in many things, for which our Progenitors forsook the then visible Church of Christ, amongst which he reckons <hi>Limbus Patrum, Prayer for the Dead, Iustification not by Faith alone, The possibility of keeping Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and the accounting of</hi> Calvinism <hi>to be</hi> Heresie <hi>at the least, if not also</hi> Treason.</q>
Which Points the <hi>Iesuit</hi> cannot prove to have been positively maintained by any one Divine in the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and yet those foolish men began to phancy such a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construction of that Ingenuity and Moderation which they found in some Professors of our Religion, whom they affirmed to be of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Worth, Learning, and Authority,</hi> as to conceive that we were coming towards an Agreement with them, even in those Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Idolatries which made the first Wall of Separation between the Churches. Upon which hope (as weak and foolish as it was) the late Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was no sooner dead, but one of their Party came to <hi>Laud,</hi> whom they looked upon as his Successor,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:54785:129"/>
seriously tendred him the offer of a <hi>Cardinals Cap,</hi> and avowed Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to perform it; to whom he presently returned this Answer, <hi>That somewhat dwelt within him which would not suffer him to accept the Offer, till</hi> Rome <hi>were otherwise than it was:</hi> And this being said, he went immediately to his Majesty,<note place="margin">

The like he also did when the same Offer was rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced a fornight after; upon which second Refusal, <hi>the Tempter left him,</hi> and that not only for that time, but for ever after.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed: To welcom him to his new great Charge, he received Letters from his Majesty, dated upon the very day of his Confirmation, upon this occasion. It had been ordered by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Canons of the Church,
<q>That none should be admitted Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con or Priest, who had not first some certain place where he might use his Function.</q>
And it was ordered by the Canons of the year 1603. in pursuance of the said old Canons,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Can.</hi> 33.</note>
                     <q>That no person should be admitted into Sacred Orders, except he shall at that time exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit to the Bishop, of whom he desireth Imposition of Hands, a Presentation of himself to some Ecclesiastical Preferment then void in that Diocess; or shall bring unto the said Bishop a true and undoubted Certificate, That either he is provided of some Church within the said Diocess, where he may attend the Cure of Souls, or of some Ministers Place vacant, either in the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Church of that Diocess, or of some other Collegiat Church therein also scituate, where he may execute his Ministry; or that he is a Fellow, or in right as a Fellow, or to be a Conduct or Chaplain in some Colledge in either of the Universities; or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be a Master of Arts of five years standing, that liveth in either of them at his own charge.</q>
And hereunto was added this Commination,
<q>That if any Bishop shall admit any person into the Ministry, that hath none of these Titles as is aforesaid, then he shall keep and maintain him with all things necessary, till he do prefer him to some Ecclesiastical Living; and on his refusal so to do, he shall be suspended by the Archbishop, being assisted with another Bishop, from giving of Orders by the space of a year.</q>

It had been formerly ordered by his Majesties Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the year 1629. "That no private Gentleman, not qualified by Law, should keep any Chaplain in his House: Which though
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54785:130"/>
it were somewhat strictly inquired into at the first, yet not a few of them retained their Chaplains, as before: For remedy whereof for the time to come, it was thought fit to tie the Bishops from giving Orders unto any which were not qualified according to the foresaid <hi>Canon</hi>; which was conceived to be the only probable means of dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the number both of such petit Lecturers, and such Trencher-Chaplains; the <hi>English</hi> Gentry not being then come to such wild ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, as to believe that any man might exercise the Priests Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in ministring the Sacraments, Praying, Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was not lawfully Ordained by some Bishop or other.

                     <q>That at all times of <hi>Ordination</hi> they be very careful to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit none into <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> but such men as for Life and Learning are fit, and which have a <hi>Title</hi> for their maintenance, according to the Laws and the ancient Practice of the Church, assuring them that his Majesty had commanded him to let them know, That he would not fail to call for an account of those his Letters, both from him and them; and therefore, That he did not doubt but that they would have a special care both of the good of the Church, and his Majesties Contentment in it.</q>
The like Letters were sent from his Majesty, by his procurement, to the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> who was as sensible of the inconvenience as himself could be. And though nothing was required in either of the said Letters, but what had been provided for in the Canon of 1603. yet was it as much inveighed against as if it had been a new device, never heard of formerly. The reason was, because that neither any Lecture, nor any possibility of being entertained as a Chaplain in the Houses of Noblemen, or others of the inferiour Gentry, could be allowed of for a <hi>Title,</hi> and consequently no <hi>Orders</hi> to be given hereafter under those Capacities. But notwithstanding those Reproaches, the Archbishops so bestirred themselves, and kept such a strict eye on their several Suffragans, that from henceforth we hear but little of such vagrant Ministers and Trencher-Chaplains (the old brood being once worn out) as had pestred and annoyed the Church in those lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Times.</p>
                  <p>It is to be observed, That the Archbishops Letter to his several Suffragans bears date on the eighteenth of <hi>October,</hi> which day gives date also to his Majesties Declaration about <hi>Lawful Sports,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which we are to know, That the Commons in the first Parliament of his Majesties Reign had gained an Act, That from thenceforth there should be no Assembly or Concourse of People out of their

own Parishes on the Lords day, or any Bull-baiting, Bear-baiting, Enterludes, Common Plays, or any other unlawful Exercises or Pastimes in their own Parishes on the same: Which being gained, they obtained another in the third Parliament, for inhibiting all Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, Waggoners, Drovers, Pack-men, for Travelling on the said day with their Horses, Waggons, Packs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As also, That no Butcher should from thenceforth kill or sell any Victual upon that day, either by himself or any other, under the several Penalties therein contained. And though it was not his Majesties purpose in those Acts to debar any of his good Subjects from any honest and harmless Recreations, which had not been prohibited by the Laws of the Land; or that it should not be lawful for them, in case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, to buy a piece of Meat for the use of their Families, the Butchers Shop not being set open as on other days: yet presently some Publick Ministers of Justice began to put another sense upon those Acts, than ever came within the compass of his meaning.

On the Return of which Certificate, so seasonably seconding the Complaint and Information of the Gentry, <hi>Richardson</hi> was again convented at the Council-Table, and peremptorily commanded to reverse his former Orders at the next Assizes for that County; withal receiving such a rattle for his former Contempt by the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> that he came out blubbering and complaining, <hi>That he had been almost choaked with a pair of Lawn Sleeves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilst these things were thus in agitation, one <hi>Brabourne</hi> a poor School-master in the Diocess of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> being seduced and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided by the continual inculcating of the Morality of the Lords-day-<hi>Sabboth</hi> from the Press and Pulpit, published a Book in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Seventh-day-<hi>Sabboth,</hi> as it was kept amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> and prescribed by <hi>Moses,</hi> according to Gods Will and Pleasure signified in the Fourth Commandment.

moved with so lewd an impudence, and fearing to be thought the Patron of a Doctrine so abhorrent from all Christian Piety, gave Order for the Author to be Censured in the <hi>High-Commission. Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne</hi> being thereupon called into that Court, and the Cause made ready for an Hearing, his Errour was so learnedly confuted by the Bishops and other judicious Divines then present, that he began to stagger in his former Opinion; which hint being taken by their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, he was admonished in a grave and Fatherly manner to submit himself unto a Conference with such Learned men as should be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thereunto; to which he chearfully consented, and found such benefit by that Meeting, that by Gods Blessing he became a Convert, and freely conformed himself to the Orthodoxal Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> concerning the <hi>Sabboth</hi> and <hi>Lords-day:</hi> Which Tendences of some of the People to downright <hi>Iudaism,</hi> grounded upon the Practices and Positions of the <hi>Sabbatarians,</hi> and seconded by the petulancy of some Publick Ministers of Justice, in debarring his good Subjects in keeping the ancient Dedication-Feast of their several Churches, occasioned his Majesty to think of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving of his Royal Fathers Declaration about <hi>Lawful Sports</hi>; To which end he gave Orders to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to cause the same to be re-printed, word for word, as it had issued from the Press in the time of his late Royal Father, <hi>Anno</hi> 1618. at the end whereof he caused this Declaration of his own sense to be super-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; that is to say:

Against this some of the Parishioners (not above five in number) appeal unto the Dean of the Arches, and the Dean and Chapter to the King. The third day of <hi>November</hi> is appointed for debating the Point in controversie before the Lords of the Council; his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty sitting as chief Judge, accompanied with <hi>Laud Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> Lord <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Yorke,</hi> Lord <hi>Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi> Lord <hi>Privy Seal,</hi> Lord Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> Lord High <hi>Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine,</hi> Earle <hi>Marshal,</hi> Lord <hi>Chamberlaine,</hi> Earle of <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> Earle of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> Mr. <hi>Treasurer,</hi> Mr. <hi>Comptroller,</hi> Mr. Secretary <hi>Cooke,</hi> Mr. Secretary <hi>Windebanke.</hi> The cause being heard, and all the Allegations on both sides exactly pondered, his Majesty first declared <hi>his dislike of all Innovations, and receding from ancient Constitutions, grounded upon just and warrantable reasons,</hi> &amp;c. And afterwards gave Sentence in behalf of the Dean and Chapter. But because this Order of his Majesty in the case of St. <hi>Gregories</hi> was made the Rule, by which all other <hi>Ordinaries</hi> did proceed, in causing the Communion Table to be placed <hi>Altarwise</hi> in the Churches of their several and respective Diocesses, I will subjoyn it here <hi>verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim</hi> as it lies before me.</p>

                        <p>This day, was debated before his Majesty sitting in <hi>Council</hi> the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion and difference which grew about the removing of the Communion Table in St. <hi>Gregories</hi> Church, near the Cathedral Church of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> from the middle of the Chancel to the upper end, and there placed <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarwise</hi> in such manner as it standeth in the said Cathedral and Mother-Church, (as also in other Cathedrals, and in his Majesties own Chappel) and as is consonant to the practice of approved Antiquity; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving and placing of it in that sort was done by order of the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> who are <hi>Ordinaries</hi> thereof, as was avowed before his Majesty by Doctor <hi>King,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Montfort,</hi> two of the <hi>Prebends</hi> there. Yet some few of the Parishioners, being but five in number, did complain of this act by appeal to the Court of <hi>Arches,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that the Book of Common Prayer, and the <hi>82</hi> Canon, do give permission to place the <hi>Communion Table</hi> where it may stand with most fitness and <hi>convenience.</hi> Now his Majesty having heard a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular relation, made by the Counsell of both parties, of all the carriage and proceedings in this cause, was pleased to declare his dislike of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:54785:133"/>
and receding from ancient Constitutions, grounded upon just and warrantable reasons, especially in matters concerning Ecclesiastical Orders and Government, knowing how easily men are drawn to affect Novelties, and how soon weak Iudgments in such cases may be overtaken and abused. And he was also pleased to observe, that if those few Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishioners might have their wills, the difference thereby from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>Cathedral Mother-Church,</hi> by which all other Churches depending thereon ought to be guided, would be the more notorious, and give more subject of discours and disputes that might be spared, by reason of the nearness of St. <hi>Gregories</hi> standing close to the Wall thereof. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, for so much as concerns the Liberty by the said <hi>Common Book</hi> or <hi>Canon,</hi> for placing the <hi>Communion Table</hi> in any Church or Chappel with most conveniency, that liberty is not so to be understood, as if it were ever left to the discretion of the Parish, much less to the particular fancy of any humorous person, but to the judgment of the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> to whose place and Function it doth properly belong to give direction in that point, both for the thing it self, and for the time, when, and how long, as he may find cause. Vpon which consideration his Majesty declared himself, that he well approved and confirmed the Act of the said <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi> and also gave commandment, that if those few Parishioners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, do proceed in their said Appeal, then the <hi>Dean of the Arches</hi> (who was then attending at the hearing of the cause) should confirm the said Order of the aforesaid <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter.</hi>

                  <p>Of this last Declaration there was no great notice took at first, the danger being remote, the case particular, and no necessity imposed of conforming to it. But the other was no sooner published then it was followed and pursued with such loud outcries as either the Tongues or Pens of the <hi>Sabbatarians</hi> could raise against it. Some fell directly on the King, and could find out no better names for this <hi>Declaration,</hi> than a <hi>Profane Edict, a maintaining of his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and a Sacrilegious robbing of God. A Toleration for prophaning the Lords day.</hi> Affirming, That it was <hi>impossible that a spot of so deep a dye should be emblanched, though somewhat might be urged to qualifie and alleviate the blame thereof.</hi> Others, and those the greatest part, impute the Republishing of this Declaration to the new Archbishop, and make it the first remarkable thing which was done presently after he took possession of his <hi>Graceship,</hi> as <hi>Burton</hi> doth pretend to wit it in his Pulpit Libell. And though these Books came not out in Print till some years after, yet was the clamour raised on both at the very first, encreasing every day more and more as the reading of it in their Churches had been pressed upon them. To stop the current of these clamours, till some better course might be devised, one who wisht well both to the Parties and the Cause, fell on a fancy of Translating into the <hi>English</hi> Tongue a <hi>Lecture</hi> or <hi>Oration</hi> made by Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> at the Act in <hi>Oxon. Anno</hi> 1622. In which he solidly discoursed both of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and <hi>Sunday,</hi> according to the judgment of the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:54785:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ancient Fathers, and the most approved Writers of the Protestant and Reformed Churches. This Lecture thus translated was ushered also with a <hi>Preface:</hi> In which there was proof offered in these three Propositions, First, <hi>That the keeping holy of one day of seven is not the moral part of the fourth Commandment.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the day is only an humane and Ecclesiastical Constitution.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That still the Church hath power to change the day, and to transfer it to some other.</hi> Which as they are the general <hi>Tendries</hi> of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, Lutheran,</hi> and <hi>Calvinian</hi> Writers beyond the Seas, so were they briefly touched at and maintained in the Doctors Lecture; which came out thus translated in the next <hi>Candlemas</hi> Term, under the Title of <hi>The Doctrine of the Sabbath, delivered in the Act at</hi> Oxon. An. 1622. <hi>By D.</hi> Prideaux, <hi>his Majesties Professor for Divinity in that Vniversity.</hi> The name of <hi>Prideaux</hi> was so Sacred that the Book was greedily bought up by those of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, presuming they should find in it some invincible Arguments to confirm both the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the Cause. But when they found how much they had deceived themselves in that expectation, and that nothing could be writ more smartly against them and their <hi>Lords-day-Sabbath</hi>; as it did very much cool their courage, and abate their clamours: so did it no less tend to the diminution of that high esteem and veneration which before they had harboured of the man. What followed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when the reading of the book was pressed, and the clamours multiplied by such as refused to read it, future time shall shew.</p>
                  <p>These passages concerning <hi>England</hi> being laid together, we must look back into the North, which still took up a great part of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties thoughts. He had observed how much his Fathers Pious Order for officiating by the <hi>English Liturgie</hi> in the Chappel Royal of that Kingdom, had been discontinued and neglected, imputing thereunto the opposition which he found amongst them at his late being there. And being resolved to pursue his said Fathers most Religious purpose of settling an uniformity of Divine Worship in all the Churches of these Kingdoms, he thought it most expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to pursue the same Method also, to the end that the people being prepared by little and little might the more willingly admit of that, or some other Liturgie like unto it, when he should think it reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to commend it to them. In order whereunto he sends to <hi>Ballen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Dumblaine,</hi> and Dean of the Chappel of that Kingdom, these Instructions following, to be observed in the <hi>Chappel Royal</hi> of <hi>Holy Rood</hi> house in the City of <hi>Edenburgh.</hi>

It had been <hi>Lauds</hi> great care, as he grew into credit with his Majesty, to give a stop to such corruptions as had been used too frequently in the Court, about Church Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which made him the less acceptable to many which were near the King in Place and Service, who formerly had been on the taking hand, and made a market of the Church as they had occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Goodman</hi> of <hi>Glocester</hi> having staid in that Diocess long enough to be as weary of them as they were of him, affected a remove to the See of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and had so far prevailed with some great Officer of State, that his Money was taken, his <hi>Conge d' es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the Archbishop coming opportunely to the knowledge of it, and being ashamed of so much baseness in the man, who could pretend no other merit than his money, so labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the business with the King, and the King so rattled up the Bishop, that he was glad to make his peace, not only with the Resignation of his Election, but the loss of his Bribe. At last, that Church a third time vacant, that is to say, by the death of <hi>Godwin,</hi> the promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Iuxon</hi> and the Resignation of <hi>Goodman,</hi> was recommended to the Government of Dr. <hi>Augustine Lindsel,</hi> not long before made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and now succeeded in that See by <hi>Francis Dee,</hi> Doctor in Divinity, and Dean of <hi>Chichester.</hi> Now begins <hi>Wren</hi> to come in play, Chaplain to his Majesty when Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and

But these surmises proved as groundless as they were unjust: For this year he was made Successor unto <hi>Iuxon</hi> as Clerk of the Closet, a place of great nearness to the King, and being once on the <hi>Ascendent</hi> he went up apace, succeeding <hi>Lindsel</hi> in the See of <hi>Hereford, Anno</hi> 1634. and <hi>Corbet</hi> in the Church of <hi>Norwich, Anno</hi> 1635. When <hi>Iuxon</hi> was advanced to the <hi>Treasurers</hi> Staff, he was made Dean of the Chappel in his place, <hi>Anno</hi> 1636. Successor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>White</hi> in the See of <hi>Ely, Anno</hi> 1638. and questionless had mounted higher had the times been favourable. Nor was he less fortunate in his Successors, leaving the Deanry of <hi>Windsor</hi> to Dr. <hi>Christopher Wren</hi> his younger brother; his Clerkship of the Closet to Dr. <hi>Richard Steward,</hi> Dean of <hi>Chichester</hi>; and the Mastership of <hi>Peterhouse</hi> to <hi>Iohn Cosens</hi> of <hi>Durham.</hi>

                  <p>We must conclude this year, and begin the next with some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings against <hi>Prynne,</hi> the Preparations to whose censure we have heard before. <hi>Candlemas</hi> Term brings him at last unto his tryal in the Court of <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> being first pre-condemned by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of his own Profession, and afterwards sentenced by that Court. The Gentlemen of the four Societies presented their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties with a Pompous and Magnificent <hi>Masque,</hi> to let them see that <hi>Prynnes</hi> leaven had not sowred them all, and that they were not poysoned with the same infection. In which as they all joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to perform that Service, so gave they such contentment to his Sacred Majesty, that he desired them to make a Representation of it to the City of <hi>London</hi>: Which they accordingly performed with no less honour to themselves, and delight to the People, than shame and sorrow unto him who had given the occasion. But greater shame and sorrow fell upon him when he came to his Censure. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chardson,</hi> Chief Justice of his Majesties <hi>Bench,</hi> highly extolled his Majesties mercy in bringing him rather unto his triall in a <hi>Criminal</hi> than a <hi>Capital</hi> way; declaring openly, that if he had been turned over to his <hi>Tribunal,</hi> he must have put himself upon a <hi>Iury,</hi> of whom no mercy could be hoped for so great an Offendor. The Earl of <hi>Dorset,</hi> being Lord Chamberlain to the Queen, aggravated his offence in aspersing with such foul reproaches a Lady of such eminent Vertue and exemplary Piety, that her very dreams were more in
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:54785:135"/>
heaven than most womens Prayers. The Archbishop having been bred in St. <hi>Iohns Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxon.</hi> where the younger Students used yearly to present some shew or other <hi>Dramatick</hi> Exercise to the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, spake much in commendation of <hi>Academical Enterludes,</hi> and the great benefit which redounded to the Actors in them, by train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in an Art of speaking, a modest confidence of Behaviour, the strengthening of the Memory in the repeating of their parts, and the enriching them with a stock of Latine Verses, out of one appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Author or other, which were their own for ever after. In fine, they generally concurred in this Censure of him,<note place="margin">

                  <p>But all this was so far from working any remorse in him,<note place="margin">1634.</note> that it rather hardened him in his waies. For in <hi>Iune</hi> following, as soon as he could provide himself of Pen, Ink and Paper, he writes a most sharp and Libellous Letter to the Lord Archbishop, touching his Censure in that Court, and that which the Archbishop in particular had declared against him. With this Letter the Archbishop ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints his Majesty, and his Majesty commands him to refer it to Atturney <hi>Noy. Noy</hi> sends for <hi>Prynne,</hi> and demands of him whether the Letter were of his own hand-writing or not; to which <hi>Prynne</hi> cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly replied, That he could make no answer to that demand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he saw the Letter, and might read the same. No sooner was the Letter put into his hands, and <hi>Noys</hi> back turned a little toward him, but presently he tore it all to pieces, and flung the pieces out of the window, to the end it might not rise in judgment against him if the Atturney should proceed to an <hi>Ore tenus,</hi> as he meant to do. With this affront, and the principal passages of the Letter, the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney acquaints their Lordships in open Court, but there was no remedy. For being there was no proof of the misdemeanour but the Letter it self, and that the Letter could not be brought in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as it should have been, the Archbishop thought it a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Act to remit the crime than to trouble the Court, or any of his Majesties Ministers in the prosecution. But herein <hi>Prynne</hi> sped bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than some others who had before been snarling at him, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to expose him both to scorn and danger. No sooner had he mounted the Chair of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but one <hi>Boyer,</hi> who not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had broke prison, to which he had been committed for felony, most grosly abused him to his face, accusing him of no less than <hi>High Treason.</hi> For which being brought into the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> the next <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term he was there censured by their Lordships as
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54785:136"/>
the Crime deserved. And presently on the neck of this, one <hi>Greene</hi> a poor decayed Printer, for whom his Grace then Bishop of <hi>London</hi> had procured a Pension of five pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> to be paid by the Company of <hi>Stationers</hi> yearly as long as he lived, adventured into the Court of St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s with a great Sword by his side, desperately swearing, That it the King did not do him Justice against the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop, he would take another course with him. For this commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto <hi>Newgate</hi>; but how long he staid there, and what other Punishment he suffered, or whether he suffered any other, or not, let them seek that list.</p>
                  <p>And that the other Sex might whet their tongues upon him also, the Lady <hi>Davies,</hi> the Widow of Sir <hi>Iohn Davies</hi> Atturney-General for King <hi>Iames</hi> in the Realm of <hi>Ireland,</hi> scatters a Prophesie against him. This Lady had before spoken something unluckily of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> importing, that he should not live till the end of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi> which raised her to the Reputation of a <hi>Cunning Woman</hi> amongst the ignorant people: and now she Prophesies of the new Archbishop, That he should live but few days after the fifth of <hi>November</hi>; for which, and other Prophesies of a more mischievous nature, she was after brought into the Court of <hi>High-Commission</hi>; the Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown so mad, that she phancied the Spirit of the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> to have been infused into her Body: And this she grounded on an <hi>Anagram</hi> which she made of her Name, <hi>viz. ELEANOR DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIES, REVEAL O DANIEL</hi>: And though the <hi>Anagram</hi> had too much by an <hi>L,</hi> and too little by an <hi>S</hi>; yet she found <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Reveal</hi> in it, and that served her turn. Much pains was taken by the Court to dispossess her of this Spirit; but all would not do, till <hi>Lamb</hi> then Dean of the <hi>Arches</hi> shot her through and through, with an Arrow borrowed from her own Quiver: For whilst the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Divines were reasoning the Point with her out of Holy Scripture, he took a Pen into his hand, and at last hit upon this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Anagram,</hi> viz. <hi>DAME ELEANOR DAVIES, NEVER SO MAD A LADIE</hi>: Which having proved to be true by the Rules of Art, <hi>Madam,</hi> said he, <hi>I see you build much on</hi> Anagrams, <hi>and I have found out one which I hope will fit you</hi>; This said, and reading it aloud, he put it into her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This ended as succesfully as he could desire: but he sped worse with another of his Female Adversaries. The Lady <hi>Purbeck,</hi> Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Hist. K.</hi> C. p. 141.</note> than the sense of the Sin, vented her malice and displeasure against the Archbishop (who had been very severe against her at the time of her Trial) when he was come unto his Greatness; spending her tongue upon him in words so full of deep disgrace and reproach unto him, that he could do no less than cause her to be laid in the <hi>Gatehouse</hi>: But being not long after delivered thence by the Practise of <hi>Howard</hi> afore-mentioned, <hi>Howard</hi> was sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon, and laid up in her place; which Punishment (though it was the least that could be looked for) he so highly stomach'd, that as soon as the Archbishop was impeach'd by the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and committed to Custody by the Lords (which hapned on <hi>Fryday December</hi> 18. 1640.) he petitioned for Relief against the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop, and some other of the <hi>High Commissioners</hi> by whom the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant had been signed. The Lords upon the reading of it imposed a Fine of 500 <hi>l.</hi> on the Archbishop himself, and 250 <hi>l.</hi> apiece upon <hi>Lamb</hi> and <hi>Duck,</hi> and pressed it with such cruel rigour, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to sell his Plate to make payment of it; the Fine being set on <hi>Munday</hi> the 21. of <hi>December,</hi> and ordered to be paid on the <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesday</hi> after.</p>
                  <p>But these Particulars have carried me beyond my year: I return therefore back again; and having shewed what Actings had been set on foot both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> must now cross over into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where we find <hi>Wentworth</hi> made Lord Deputy in the place of <hi>Faulkland.</hi> We told you formerly of some dearness which was growing between him and <hi>Laud</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> at his first Admission to the place of a Privy-Counsellor. Toward the latter end of <hi>Ianuary, Anno</hi> 1630. <hi>Wentworth</hi> being then Lord President of the Council established for the Northern Parts, bestowed a Visit on him at <hi>London</hi>-House, where they had some private Conference touching the better Settlement of Affairs both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> of which Kingdom <hi>Wentworth</hi> not long after was Created Lord Deputy. He staid somewhat longer from his Charge than he would have done, to be present at the Censure of <hi>Williams</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> informed against in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> by his Majesties <hi>Atturney-General,</hi> for some dangerous and disgraceful words which he was reported to have spoken of his Majesties Government, and revealing some Secrets which his Majesty had formerly committed to his Trust as a Privy-Counsellor: But <hi>Williams</hi> found so many shifts to put off the Trial, that the Deputy was fain to leave him in the same estate in which he found him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cant. Doom,</hi> p. 82.</note> and hoised Sail for <hi>Ireland.</hi> Scarce was he setled in his Power, but he began to reform some things which he beheld as blemishes in the face of that Church. In the Chappel of the Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the chief Seat of his Residence, he found a fair large Pue at the end of the Choire, erected for the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:54785:137"/>
use of his Predecessors in that place; the Communion-Table in the mean time being thrust out of doors. This Pue he commands to be taken down, and the Holy Table to be restored to its ancient place, where the Altar formerly had stood. In <hi>Christ-Church</hi> the Cathedral of that City, to which the Lord Deputies repair on <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> and <hi>Holydays</hi> for Gods Publick Worship, he found the Holy Table scituated in the middle of the Choire or Chancel, and day by day profaned by Boys and Girles, who sate upon it: This Table he caused to be removed also, as he did the other. And whereas the Earl of <hi>Cork</hi> had built a stately Monument for his Wife and some of her Ancestors, but chiefly for himself and his own Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at the East end of the Choire in St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Church, being the second of that City, the Lord Deputy required him to take it down, or otherwise to satisfie the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in the standing of it.</p>
                  <p>Of all these things he gave Order to his Chaplain <hi>Bramhall</hi> to give the Archbishop an Account, which <hi>Bramhall</hi> did accordingly in his Letters of the tenth of <hi>August</hi> 1633. In which Letters he gave this testimony also of the Deputies Care, <hi>That it was not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for the Intentions of a mortal Man, to be more serious and sincere in those things that concerned the good of the</hi> Irish <hi>Church, than his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships were.</hi> And that he might lay a sure foundation to proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he procured the University of <hi>Dublin</hi> to make choice of <hi>Laud,</hi> then being Lord Elect of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for their Lord and <hi>Chancellor.</hi> To this they chearfully assented, passed the Election on the fourteenth of <hi>September, Anno</hi> 1633. being but six days before his actual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation into the Metropolitical and Supream Dignity of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Nor was it long before they found on what a gracious Benefactor they had placed that Honour: He had been told by <hi>Ryves,</hi> his Majesties Advocate (who formerly had exercised that Office in the Realm of <hi>Ireland</hi>) of the deplorable condition of that Church in the respect of Maintenance. Most of the Tythes had been appropriated to Monasteries and Religious Houses, afterwards vested in the Crown, or sold to private Subjects, and made <hi>Lay-Fees</hi>; The Vicaridges for the most part Stipendary, and their Stipends so miserable sordid, that in the whole Province of <hi>Connaught</hi> most of the Vicars Pensions came but to 40 <hi>s. per Annum,</hi> and in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces but 16. The Bishopricks at that time were many in number, but of small Revenue, having been much dilapidated in the change of Religion, some of them utterly unable to maintain a Bishop, and no good Benefice near them to be held <hi>in Commendam.</hi>

For remedy whereof, he took an opportunity to move his Majesty to restore all such Impropriations to the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as were then vested in the Crown.

Encouraged by which Royal Example, the Earl of <hi>Cork,</hi> who from a very small beginning had raised himself to a vast Revenue in that Kingdom, Re-built some Churches, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired others; restored some of his Impropriations to those several Churches; and doubtless had proceeded further, if a difference had not hapned betwixt the Lord Deputy and him, about the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Monument which he had erected for himself and his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, in one of the principal Churches of the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> as before was said. And as for the improving of the Bishopricks, as <hi>Ossory</hi> and <hi>Kilkenny, Killmore</hi> and <hi>Ardagh, Down</hi> and <hi>Connor,</hi> and possibly some others had before this been joined together; so was it advised by the <hi>Primate,</hi> That <hi>Kilfenore</hi> should be joined unto that of <hi>Killalow,</hi> lying contiguous to each other; Both which being joined by a perpetual union, were thought sufficient to make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Competency for an <hi>Irish</hi> Bishop.</p>
                  <p>But all this Care had been to little or no purpose, if some course were not also taken to preserve Religion, endangered on this side by <hi>Popery,</hi> and on that by <hi>Calvinism</hi>; each side unwillingly contributing to the growth of the other.

The <hi>Papists</hi> being first suppressed, it was conceived to be no hard matter to reduce the <hi>Calvinians</hi> to Conformity; and to suppress the <hi>Papists,</hi> it was found expedient, That the standing Army should be kept in continual Pay, and that Monies should be levied on the

That since the Dissolving of their new <hi>Frieries</hi> in the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> they had Erected them in the Country, and had brought the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to such a sottish negligence, that they cared not to learn the Commandments as God spake and left them; but flocked in Multitudes to the hearing of such Superstitious Doctrines as some of their own Priests were ashamed of; That a <hi>Synodical</hi> Meeting of their Clergy had been held lately at <hi>Drogheda</hi> in the Province of <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> in which it was decreed, <hi>That it was not lawful to take the Oath of Allegiance</hi>; And therefore, That in such a conjuncture of Affairs to think that the bridle of the Army might be taken away, must be the thought not of a Brain-sick, but of a Brainless man: which whosoever did endeavour, not only would oppose his Majesties Service, but expose his own neck to the Skeanes of those <hi>Irish</hi> cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throats.</q>
All which he humbly refers to his Lordships seasonable Care and Consideration. Upon this Information, the Deputy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his Majesties leave to hold a Parliament in that Kingdom, which he managed with such notable dexterity, that he made himself Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of a Power sufficient to suppress the Insolencies of the <hi>Papists,</hi> and yet exceedingly prevailed upon their Affections. From which time forwards the <hi>Popish Recusants</hi> in that Kingdom were kept in stricter duty, and held closer to loyal Obedience, for fear of irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting so severe a Magistrate, than ever they had been by any of his Predecessors.</p>
                  <p>This Parliament brought with it a Convocation, as a thing of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:54785:138"/>
course; and in that somewhat must be done to check the spreading of <hi>Calvinism</hi> in all parts of that Church. The Articles of Religion agreed upon in Convocation <hi>Anno</hi> 1615. were so contrived by <hi>Vsher</hi> the now Lord <hi>Primate,</hi>
                     <q>That all the <hi>Sabbatarian</hi> and <hi>Calvinian</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours were declared therein to be the Doctrines of that Church; Most grievous Torments immediately in his Soul affirmed to be endured by Christ, which <hi>Calvin</hi> makes to be the same with his <hi>descent into Hell</hi>; The abstenencies from eating Flesh upon certain days, declared not to be Religious Fasts: but to be grounded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Politick Ends and Considerations; All Ministers adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Lawfully called, who are called unto the Work of the Ministry by those that have Publick Authority given them in the Church (but whether they be Bishops or not, it makes no matter, so that he be Authorized unto it by their several Churches): The Sacerdotal Power of Absolution made <hi>declarative</hi> only, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently quite subverted; No Power ascribed unto the Church in Ordaining <hi>Canons,</hi> or censuring any of those who either carelesly or maliciously do infringe the same; the <hi>Pope</hi> made <hi>Antichrist,</hi> according to the like Determination of the <hi>French Hugonots</hi> made at <hi>Gappe</hi> in <hi>Dolphine:</hi> And finally, such a silence concerning the Consecration of Archbishops and Bishops (expresly justified and avowed in the <hi>English</hi> Book) as if there were not a different Order from the Common <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
                     </q>
All which, being <hi>Vsher</hi>'s own Opinions, were dispersed in several places of these Articles for the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> approved of in that Convocation, and finally confirmed by the Lord Deputy <hi>Chichester</hi> in the Name of King <hi>Iames.</hi> By means whereof these two great mischiefs did ensue; First, A great matter of division which it caused to the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> of the Realm, that in three Kingdoms, under the Obedience of one Sovereign Prince, there should be three distinct and contrary Professions, and yet pretending every one to the same Religion. And secondly, Whensoever the Points were agitated here in <hi>England</hi> against the <hi>Sabbatarian</hi> and <hi>Calvinian</hi> Rigours, the Disputants were forthwith choaked by the Authority of these Articles, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Judgment of King <hi>Iames,</hi> who confirmed the same. If therefore the Archbishop meant to have Peace in <hi>England,</hi> the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> must be won to desert those Articles, and receive ours in <hi>England</hi> in the place thereof.</p>
                  <p>This to effect, it was not thought expedient by such as had the managing of that design, to propose any abrogation or repealing of the former Articles, which had so many Friends and Patrons in that Convocation, that it was moved severally both in the House of the Bishops, and in that of the Clergy, to have them ratified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the present Meeting. And questionless it had been carried in that way, if it had not seasonably been diverted by telling the Promoters of it, That those Articles had already received as much Authority as that Church could give them, and that by seeking to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54785:139"/>
procure any such Confirmation, they would weaken the Original Power by which they stood. This blow being thus handsomly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, their next work was to move the <hi>Primate,</hi> That for the avoiding of such scandal which was given the <hi>Papists,</hi> and to declare the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Judgment and Affections between the Churches, a <hi>Canon</hi> might be passed in approbation of the Articles of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> To this the Prelate being gained, the <hi>Canon</hi> was drawn up and presented to him; and being by him propounded, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly passed, one only man dissenting when it came to the Vote, who had pierced deeper into the bottom of the Project than the others did. It was desired also by <hi>Bramhall,</hi> not long before the Lord Deputies Chaplain, but then Bishop of <hi>Derrie,</hi> That the whole Body of <hi>Canons</hi> made in the year 1603. might be admitted in that Church: But the <hi>Primate</hi> was ever so afraid of <hi>bowing</hi> at the Name of <hi>IESVS,</hi> and some other Reverences required in them, which he neither practised nor approved, that he would by no means hearken to it, which bred some heats between him and <hi>Bramhall,</hi> ending at last in this Temperament, That some select <hi>Canons</hi> should be taken out of that Book, and intermingled with some others of their own composing. But for the <hi>Canon</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and received the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it was this that followeth; <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>Such was the <hi>Canon</hi> passed in this Convocation, for the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reception of the Articles of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Which <hi>Canon</hi> was no sooner passed, confirmed, and published, but the <hi>Primate</hi> and his Party saw the danger which they had cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into by their inadvertency; and found too late, That by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and approving the <hi>English</hi> Articles, they had abrogated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed the <hi>Irish.</hi> To salve this sore, it concerned them to bestir themselves with their utmost diligence, and so accordingly they did.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:54785:139"/>
For first the <hi>Primate,</hi> and some Bishops of his opinions, required <hi>subscription</hi> to the Articles of both Churches of all such as came to be <hi>ordained</hi> at the next <hi>Ordination.</hi> But it went no further than the next, for if the Papists made it a matter of Derision to have three Confessions in the three Churches of his Majesties Kingdoms;<note place="margin">Judgment of the Lord Primate, <hi>p</hi> 121.</note> How much more matter must it give them of scorn and laughter, that there should be two different Confessions in the same Church, and both subscribed unto, but as one and the same.</p>
                  <p>The Primate next applies himself to the Lord Deputy,<note place="margin">Judg. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Pri. <hi>Ilid.</hi> 112.</note> beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that the former Articles might receive a new Ratification by Act of Parliament for preventing all innovations in the Religion there established: But he found but little comfort there, the Lord Deputy threatning to cause the said Confession to be burnt by the hand of the hangman; if at the least the <hi>Scots</hi> Commissioners may be believed; amongst whose Articles against him I find this for one. Finding no better hopes on that side of the Sea, he dispatcheth his Letters of Advice to his Friends in <hi>England,</hi> one to an Honourable Person amongst the rest, assuring them that though by a Canon pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in that Convocation they had received and approved the Articles of <hi>England</hi>; yet that the Articlers of <hi>Ireland</hi> were ever called in, might well be reckoned for a fancy. The like affirmed in a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate made by <hi>Bernard,</hi> and <hi>Pullen,</hi> two Members of the Lower House in this Convocation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ols. ol serv.</hi> p. 42.</note> where it is said, <hi>That whosoever do aver that the said Articles were abolished, are grosly mistaken and have abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the said Convocation in delivering so manifest an untruth.</hi> And to back this, another Certificate must be gained from one who comes commended to us under the Title of <hi>a most eminent, judicious, and learned person,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judg. of L. Pri <hi>p.</hi> 121.</note> who having considered of the matter, <hi>Conceives that both Confessions were consistent; and that the Act of the Synod was not a Revocation of the Irish Articles, but an approbation of the English, as agreeing with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all this would not serve the turn, or save those Articles from being brought under a <hi>Repeal</hi> by the present Canon. For first, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the Canon, <hi>That they did not only approve, but receive the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Church of</hi> England. Their <hi>approbation</hi> of them, had they gone no further, had been a sufficient manifestation of their agreement with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Confession of the same Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion: But their <hi>receiving</hi> of the same doth intimate a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinducing of them upon the other, and is equivalent both in Fact and Law to the <hi>Repealing</hi> of the old. For otherwise St. <hi>Paul</hi> must needs be out in the Rules of <hi>Logick</hi> when he proved the <hi>Abrogating</hi> of the old <hi>Covenant</hi> by the superinduction of a new; For having affirmed, that God by speaking of a <hi>New</hi> Covenant, had <note n="(d)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Dicendo autem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum, vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravit prius,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 8 13.</note> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated and made void the first, (or made the first old as our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish read it;) he adds immediatly, <hi>That that which is old, decayeth, and is ready to vanish away</hi>; that is to say, as <hi>Diodati</hi> descants on it, The old being disanulled by the new, there must necessarily follow
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:54785:140"/>
the abolishment of its use and practice. Nor find they any other abrogation of the <hi>Iewish Sabbath</hi> then by the superinducing of the <hi>Lords day for the day of worship.</hi> By means whereof the Sabbath was lessened in authority and reputation by little and little, and in short time was absolutely laid aside in the Church of Christ; the fourth Commandement, by which it was at first ordained, being still in force. So then according to these grounds the Articles of <hi>Ireland</hi> were <hi>virtually,</hi> though not formally, abrogated; or else it must be granted, that there were two Confessions in the same one Church, different both in form and matter, and contrary in some points unto one another, which would have been so far from creating an unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between the Churches in the concernments of Religion, that it would have raised a greater disagreement within <hi>Ireland</hi> it self than was before between the Churches of both Kingdoms. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the gaining of this point did much advantage the Archbishop, conducing visibly to the promotion of his ends and Counsels in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Irish Clergy subject to the two Declarations, and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for their breaking and neglect thereof, that is to say, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Declaration about Lawful Sports, and that prefixt before the book of Articles for appeasing Controversies. Take for a farewell this acknowledgment of a late Historian,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ch. Hist.</hi> B. 11. p. 128.</note> speaking as well the sense of others as his own,
<q>A <hi>Convocation</hi> (concurrent with a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>) was called (saith he) and kept at <hi>Dublin</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the thirty nine Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for all to subscribe unto. It was adjudged fit, seeing that Kingdom complies with <hi>England</hi> in the Civil Government, it should also conform thereunto in matters of Religion.</q>
And thereupon he thus concludes,
<q>That in the mean time the <hi>Irish</hi> Articles concluded formerly in a <hi>Synod,</hi> 1616. (mistaken for 1615.) (wherein <hi>Arminianism</hi> was condemned <hi>in terminis termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantibus,</hi> and the observation of the <hi>Lords day</hi> resolved <hi>Iure divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>) were utterly excluded.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But leaving <hi>Ireland</hi> to the care of the Lord Deputy, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Derry,</hi> who under him had the chief managing of the affairs of that Church; let us see how the new Archbishop proceeds in <hi>England,</hi> where he had so many plows going at once, too many, as it after proved, to work well together. For not thinking he had done enough in order to the peace and uniformity of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by taking care for it here at home, his thoughts transported him with the like affection to preserve it from neglect abroad. To which end he had offered some considerations to the Lords of the Council, as before was said, <hi>Anno</hi> 1622. relating to the regulation of Gods publick Worship amongst the <hi>English Factories,</hi> and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beyond the Seas, and the reducing of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches, settled in divers parts of this Realm, unto some confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. In reference to the first, he had not sate long in the Chaire of <hi>Canterbury</hi> when he procured an Order from the Lords of the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:54785:140"/>
Council, bearing date <hi>Octob.</hi> 1. 1633. By which their <hi>English</hi> Churches and Regiments in <hi>Holland</hi> (and afterwards by degrees in all other Foreign parts and plantations) were required strictly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the <hi>English</hi> Liturgie with all the Rites and Ceremonies prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in it. Which Order contained the sum and substance of those considerations which he had offered to the Board touching that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. With which the Merchant Adventurers being made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, with joynt consent they made choice of one <hi>Beaumont</hi> (reputed for a learned, sober, and conformable man) to be Preacher to their Factory residing at <hi>Delf, Forbes,</hi> a <hi>Scot</hi> by birth, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had been Preacher to the Society, being either dead, or other wise departed to avoid conformity. And that this man might be received with the better welcome a Letter is sent with him to the Deputy Governour, subscribed by the Archbishop himself, in which he signifieth both to him and the rest in his Majesties name,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cant. Doom,</hi> p. 407.</note>
                     <q>That they were to receive him with all decent and courteous usage fitting his person and calling, allowing him the ancient Pension which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had been paid to his Predecessors. Which said in reference to the man, he lets them know that it was his Majesties express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that both he, the Deputy, and all and every other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, that is or shall be residing in those parts beyond the Seas, do conform themselves to the Doctrine and Discipline settled in the Church of <hi>England</hi>: and that they Frequent the Common-Prayer with all Religious duty and reverence at all times required, as well as they do Sermons; and that out of their company they should yearly about <hi>Easter,</hi> as the Canons prescribe, name two Church-Wardens, and two Sides-men, which may look to the Orders of the Church, and give an account according to their office. It was also required that these present Letters should be registred and kept by them, that they which come after might take notice what care his Majesty had taken for the well ordering of the said Company in Church affairs; and that a Copy of the same should be delivered to the said <hi>Beaumont,</hi> and to every Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor of his respectively, that he and they might know what his Majesty expected of them, and be the more inexcusable if they disobey it.</q>
With this Dispatch, bearing date the seventeenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> this present year 1634. away goes <hi>Beaumont</hi> into <hi>Holland,</hi> taking with him these Instructions for his own proceedings; that is to say,
<q>That he should punctually keep and observe all the Orders of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as they are prescribed in the <hi>Canons</hi> and the <hi>Rubricks</hi> of the <hi>Liturgie</hi>; and that if any person of that Company shall shew himself refractory to that Ordinance of his Majesty, he should certifie the name of any such offender, and his offence to the Lord Bishop of <hi>London</hi> for the time being, who was to take order and give remedy accordingly.</q>
Which Order and Instructions given to <hi>Beaumont</hi> in private, were incorporated also in the Letter, least otherwise he might be thought to act any thing in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:54785:141"/>
it without good Authority. And he accordingly proceeded with such honest zeal, and was so punctual in observing his Majesties pleasure and commands, that for a reward of his good service he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto a Prebends place in the Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> though by the unhappy change of times, it brought more reputation than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage with it.</p>
                  <p>And now at last we have the face of an <hi>English</hi> Church in <hi>Holland,</hi> responsal to the Bishops of <hi>London</hi> for the time being, as a part of their Diocess, directly and immediately subject to their Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The like course also was prescribed for our Factories in <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> and those further off, that is to say, in <hi>Turky,</hi> in the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guls</hi> Dominions, the <hi>Indian Islands,</hi> the Plantations in <hi>Virginia,</hi> the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and all other places where the English had any standing Residence in the way of trade. The like done also for regulating the Divine Service in the Families of all Ambassadours, residing in the Courts of Foreign Princes for his Majesties Service; as also in the <hi>English</hi> Regiments, serving under the States. The superinspection of which last was referred to <hi>Boswel</hi> his Majesties Resident at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and his Successors in that place; as he and all the rest of the Embassadors, in what place soever, were to be ordered by the care of the Lords of the Council; and they to be accountable therein to his Sacred Majesty, as the Supream Ordinary. The English <hi>Agents</hi> and Embassadours in the Courts of Foreign Princes had not been formerly so regardful of the honour of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as they might have been, in designing a set <hi>Room</hi> for religious uses, and keeping up the Vestments, Rites and Ceremonies, prescribed by Law in performance of them. It was now hoped that there would be a Church of <hi>England</hi> in all Courts of <hi>Christendom,</hi> in the chief Cities of the <hi>Turk,</hi> and other great <hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes, in all our Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Plantations in every known Part of the world, by which it might be rendred as diffused and <hi>Catholick</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In reference to the regulating of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches here amongst our selves, he conceived himself in a capacity of putting his own Counsels in execution, either as Bishop of the Diocess, or Archbishop of the Province of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> He had considered of the dangers which those Foreign Churches drew on this, by standing divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and dismembred from the rest of the body; and of the countenance and encouragement which was given to the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction in the promoting of Schism. There was no <hi>Traverse</hi> to be made to this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> but either they were or were not of the same Religion with the Church of <hi>England.</hi> If they were not of the same Religion why should they, being strangers, borne in other Countries, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending from them, expect more Liberty of Conscience than the Papists had, being all Natives, and descending from English Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents? If of the same, why should they not submit to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Forms of Worship, being the outward acts and exercises
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:54785:141"/>
of the Religion here by Law established? It was now as when they first fled into this Land from the Fire and Faggot; from which their own Countries having felt no Persecution for forty or fifty years last past, were at this time freed: And therfore if they did not like the Terms of their staying here, they might return from whence they came, in peace and safety, with thanks to God and the good <hi>English</hi> Nation, for the long and comfortable Entertainment they had found amongst them. Upon these grounds, and such Considerations as had before been offered to the Lords of the Council, before he had sate a whole year in the Chair of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he caused these three Articles to be tendred to the <hi>French</hi> Congregation in that City, and the two <hi>Dutch</hi> Congregations in <hi>Sandwich</hi> and <hi>Maidston, Apr.</hi> 14. 1634. 1. <hi>What</hi> Liturgie <hi>do you use? or whether you have not the</hi> Dutch <hi>or</hi> French <hi>in use</hi>? 2. <hi>Of how many Descents for the most part they were born Subjects</hi>? 3. <hi>Whether such as are born Subjects, will conform to the Church of</hi> England? For Answer to the Articles (after some fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Pleas touching their Exemptions) they obtained time till the fifth of <hi>May</hi>; against which time, with the consent of their several Churches, they prepared these several Answers. To the first it was answered, <hi>That they had that</hi> Liturgie <hi>which all the Churches of the</hi> French <hi>Tongue</hi> (<hi>both in</hi> France, <hi>and in the</hi> United Provinces <hi>of the</hi> States) <hi>have had since the blessed Reformation, and which their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es (refuged here) have had this sixty or seventy years, or more: That the</hi> English Liturgie <hi>was Translated into</hi> French, <hi>but that they used it not; and that they knew not whether it were Translated in</hi> Dutch <hi>or not.</hi> To the second it was answered, <hi>That the greatest part of the Heads of the Families were not born here, but about a third part; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that the greatest part of the old ones were Strangers born, and many others are newly come since a few years.</hi> But to the third they desired to be excused from making any Answer at all, foreseeing (as it was pretended) a dissipation of their Churches, in reference to the maintainance of their Ministry and relief of their poor, if such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity should be pressed, which they endeavoured to avoid by all means imaginable. But before these Answers were returned, it was thought fit to consult with the <hi>Coetus</hi> (as they style it) of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches in <hi>London,</hi> who were concerned as much as they, and who by reason of their wealth and number governed all the rest; by whom they were advised to suppress those Answers, and to present their <hi>Declinator,</hi> fixing themselves upon their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and challenging the Exemption granted them by King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> vi. confirmed by several Acts of Council in the Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>Iames,</hi> and his Sacred Majesty.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Declinator</hi> no way satisfied his <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> He knew, none better, That Acts of Council were not like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> but might be changed and varied as occasion served; That the Letters Patents granted by King <hi>Edward</hi> vi. to the first Congregation of Strangers under <hi>Iohn A Lasco</hi> (by which they
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:54785:142"/>
were Licenced to use their own Forms both of Worship and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, without any disturbance) were vacated by the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the said Congregation in the time of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; and that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches now in <hi>England,</hi> could pretend no succession unto that in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> vi. And therefore as soon as <hi>Brent</hi> returned from his <hi>Visitation</hi> (of which we shall hear more anon) and had a while reposed himself after that long Journey, he was dispatched to <hi>Canterbury</hi> with these <hi>Injunctions, viz.</hi> 1. <hi>That all the Natives of the</hi> Dutch <hi>and</hi> Walloon <hi>Congregations in his</hi> Graces <hi>Diocess, are to repair to their several Parish Churches where they inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, to hear Divine Service and Sermons, and perform all Duties and Payments required in that behalf:</hi> And 2. <hi>That all the Ministers, and all other of the same</hi> Walloon <hi>or</hi> French <hi>Congregations, which are Aliens born, shall have and use the</hi> Liturgie <hi>used in the</hi> English <hi>Churches, as the same is or may be faithfully Translated into</hi> French <hi>or</hi> Dutch. These two <hi>Injunctions</hi> being given on the nineteenth of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> with time for conforming thereunto till the first of <hi>March,</hi> were presently communicated by the <hi>Kentish</hi> to the <hi>London</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and by those of <hi>London</hi> to the rest in the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> requiring them to send their Deputies to consult together with them in this Common Danger. There were at that time ten Churches of Strangers in this Province; that is to say, two in <hi>London,</hi> two in <hi>Norwich,</hi> and one apiece in <hi>Canterbury, Sandwich, Maidstone, Southampton, Colchester,</hi> and <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> who were to send their sufficient Deputies, consisting of Ministers and Lay-Elders, to make this <hi>Synod.</hi> But because the time might be elapsed before these Deputies from so many Places could meet together, and resolve upon any Conclusion; it was determined by the <hi>Coetus,</hi> that those of <hi>Kent,</hi> whom it most immediately concerned, should address themselves to the Archbishop, and desire his favour for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Priviledges, as in former times; whose Propositions being heard, and their Reasons pondered, he answered, <hi>That it was his purpose to make a General Visitation of all his Province, and that he would begin at home; That he did nothing but what had been communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the King, and resolved by the Council; That neither the</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents <hi>of King</hi> Edward vi. <hi>nor any Reasons by them alledged, should hinder him from proceeding in the said</hi> Injunctions; <hi>That their Churches were nests and occasions of Schism, which he would prevent in</hi> Kent <hi>as well as he could; That it were better there were no Foreign Churches nor Strangers in</hi> England, <hi>than to have them thereby to give occasion of prejudice or danger to the Church-Government of it; That they endeavoured to make themselves a State in a State, and had vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> That they feared not his Injunctions; <hi>but, That he hoped the King would maintain him in it, as long as he Governed by the</hi> Canons; <hi>That the dissipation of their Churches, and maintenance of two or three Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, was not to be laid in the same Balance with the Peace and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of the Church of</hi> England; <hi>That their ignorance in the</hi> English
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:54785:142"/>
                     <hi>Tongue, ought not to be used for a pretence for their not going to their Parish Churches, considering that it was an affected Ignorance, and they might avoid it when they would: And finally, That he was resolved to have his</hi> Injunctions <hi>put in execution, and that they should conform to them at their peril by the time appointed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finding no hope of Good this way, they expect the Sitting of the <hi>Synod</hi> on the fifth of <hi>February</hi>; to which the Deputies made a Report of their ill Successes; and thereupon it was resolved, That a Petition in the name of all the Foreign Churches, should be presented unto the King; which way they found as unsuccessful as the other was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For his Majesty having read the Petition, delivered it to the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> commanding him to give it to one of the Secretaries. And though <hi>Pembroke,</hi> either out of love to the Cause, or hate to the Archbishops Person, chose rather to deliver it to <hi>Cooke</hi> than <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debank</hi>; yet neither <hi>Cooke</hi> himself, nor <hi>Weckerly</hi> his chief Clerk (a <hi>Walloon</hi> by birth) who had very much espoused the Quarrel, could do any thing in it. The next course was to back that Petition with a Remonstrance, containing the chief Reasons which they had to urge in their own behalf; and that Remonstrance to be put into his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties hands by the Duke of <hi>Soubize,</hi> a Prince of great Descent in <hi>France,</hi> and a chief stickler in the Wars of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> against their King: In which Reasons, when they came to be examined more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, there was nothing found material, but what had formerly been observed and answered; except it were the fear of a Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be raised in <hi>France,</hi> when it should there be known, how much the <hi>French</hi> Churches in this Kingdom had been discountenanced and distressed. And this they after aggravated by some fresh Intelligence which they had from thence, by which they were advertised of some words of the great Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> to this effect, <hi>viz. That if a King of</hi> England, <hi>who was a</hi> Protestant, <hi>would not permit two</hi> Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines <hi>in his Kingdom, why should a King of</hi> France, <hi>a</hi> Papist, <hi>permit two Religions</hi>? Great workings had been in the Court upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; though all which was effected by it, was but the present qualification of the second <hi>Injunction</hi>; His Majesty on good Reason of <hi>State</hi> insisting so strongly on the first, that it could not be altered. But as for the second <hi>Injunction,</hi> it was qualified thus, <hi>viz. That the Ministers, and all others of the</hi> French <hi>and</hi> Dutch <hi>Congregations, which are not Natives, and born Subjects to the Kings Majesty, or any other Stranger that shall come over to them, while they remain Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers may have and use their own</hi> Discipline, <hi>as formerly they have done; yet it is thought fit that the</hi> English Liturgie <hi>should be Translated into the</hi> French <hi>and</hi> Dutch, <hi>for the better fitting of their Children to the</hi> English <hi>Government.</hi> But before the <hi>Injunction</hi> thus qualified could be sent to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Mayor and Brethren of that City were put upon a Petition in their behalf, insisting, amongst other things, on the great Charge which would fall upon them, if the relief of the poor <hi>French,</hi> which formerly had been maintained on the common
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:54785:143"/>
Purse of that Church, should be cast upon the several Parishes; and the great want of Work which would happen to their own Poor in that City, if the Manufactures of the <hi>French</hi> should be discontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To which Petition they received a favourable Answer in respect of themselves; but without any alteration of his Graces purpose in such other points of it as concerned those Churches. A Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was also used in regard of the Ministers which did Officiate in those Churches; it being condescended to on the suit of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, That such of their Ministers as were <hi>English</hi> born should continue in their Place and Ministry, as in former times: but that hereafter none should be admitted to be Ministers in their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, but such as were Strangers. Which Condescensions not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, It was directed by the <hi>Coetus</hi> of the <hi>London</hi> Churches, That by no means the <hi>Kentish</hi> Foreigners should publish the said <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions</hi> in their Congregations; and that if the prosecution of them should be strictly urged, they would then think upon some other course to bear of that blow. And by this Tergiversation they gained so much time, that the final Decree was not passed upon them till the 26th of <hi>September</hi> 1635. when to the former <hi>Injunction</hi> they found this Clause or <hi>Proviso</hi> added, <hi>viz. That the Natives should continue to contribute to the maintenance of their Ministry, and the Poor of their Church, for the subsisting thereof; and that an Order should be obtained from his Majesty, if it were desired, to maintain them in their</hi> Manufactures, <hi>against all such as should endeavour to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest them by Informations.</hi> Some time was spent about the publishing of this Decree, the Ministers and Elders of those Churches refusing to act any thing in it: But at the last it was published in the <hi>French</hi> Church at <hi>Canterbury</hi> by one of their <hi>Notaries,</hi> and in <hi>Sandwich</hi> by the <hi>Chanter</hi> or Clerk of the Congregation, with Order to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Churchwardens of the several Parishes, to take notice of such of the Natives as resorted not diligently to their Parish Churches.</p>
                  <p>This proved a leading Case to all the other <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches on this side of the Seas, though they opposed it what they could. For no sooner was the News of these <hi>Injunctions</hi> first brought to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> when a Remonstrance was presented to <hi>Corbet</hi> (who was then Bishop of that Diocess) and by him transmitted to the Archbishop; in which they had expressed such Reasons against the tenour of the same, as we have met with formerly in this Narration. But the Archbishops Visitation of that Diocess in the year next following, <hi>Anno</hi> 1635. put an end to that business; the <hi>Injunction</hi> being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in the Churches of Strangers in that City, before any publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them had been made in <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Nor was the like done only in all the Churches of Strangers in the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but in those of <hi>York,</hi> where the Archbishop kept them to a harder Diet; for having seen what had been done by <hi>Brent</hi> in his Visitation, and having no such powerful Sollicitors as the <hi>Coetus</hi> of the <hi>London</hi>
                     <pb n="281" facs="tcp:54785:143"/>
Churches to take off his edge, he denied them the Exercise of any Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction of their own; injoins them the use of the <hi>English Liturgie</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, with Obedience to all the Laws and Ordinances of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament once a year in the Church of the Parish where they dwell, and to perform all their Christenings, Marriages, and Burials there, or else none of their Congregations to be permitted. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this care of the <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> the business went forward more or less, as the Ministers and Church-wardens stood affected in their several Parishes. And in most Parishes the Ministers and Church-wardens were so well pleased with that indecency which they had amongst them, in respect of any Superiors in Church-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, to whom they might be made accountable for Life or Doctrine, that generally they wish'd themselves in the same conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And being freed from their greatest fear, of having the Poor of those Churches cast upon them in their several Parishes, they seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not much sollicitous whether they came to the Church or not, to hear the Sermons, receive the Sacraments, or perform any other part of Publick Worship; especially if they were not scrupulous in paying to the Minister his accustomed Dues, and yielding to such Rates and Taxes as the Church-wardens laid upon them for Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial uses. If any Minister began to look too strictly to them, they would find some means to take him off by Gifts and Presents, or by some powerful Letter from some of the Grandees residing in <hi>London,</hi> and sometimes from a neighbouring Justice, whose displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure must not be incurred. And that they might not want encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to stand it out as long as they could, the leading men of the <hi>Genevian</hi> Faction in most parts of the Realm, did secretly solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them not to be too forwards in conforming to the said <hi>Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> assuring them of such Assistances as might save them harmless, and flattering them with this Opinion of themselves, That the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Gospel, and the most desirable Freedom of the Church from Episcopal Tyranny, depended chiefly on their Courage and Resolution. What was done afterwards in pursuance of the said <hi>Injunctions,</hi> shall be told elsewhere: all which Particulars I have laid together, that the Proceedings of his Grace in this weighty bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness (so much calumniated and defamed) might be presented to the Reader without interruption.</p>
                  <p>It was once said by <hi>Telesinus</hi> to <hi>Caj. Marius, That he did well to scoure the Country; but</hi> Italy <hi>would never want Wolves, so long as</hi> Rome <hi>continued so fit a Forest to afford them shelter.</hi> In like manner the Archbishop knew full well how small a Progress he should make in his Reformation, for reducing the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> to a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Church of <hi>England</hi> to it self, if <hi>London</hi> were not brought to some Conformity. Which City having a strong influence on all parts of the Kingdom, was generally looked on as the Compass by which the lesser Towns and Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:54785:144"/>
were to steer their Course, the practice of it being pleaded upon all occasions, for Vestries, Lectures, and some other Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the State of the Church. And to this nothing more concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, than that the Beneficed Clergy being but meanly provided for, were forced to undertake some Lectures, or otherwise to connive at many things, contrary to their own Judgment and the Rules of the Church; in hope that gaining the good will thereby of the Chief of their Parishes, they might be gratified by them with Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Presents, and some other helps to mend their Maintenance. The Lecturers in the mean time, as being Creatures of the People, and depending wholly on the Purse of the wealthier Citizens, not only overtopped them in point of Power and Reputation, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of Profit and Revenue also. Not that these Lecturers were maintained so much by the Zeal and Bounty of their Patrons, as by a general Fraud, which for many years last past had been put upon the Regular Clergy, by the diminishing of whose just Dues in Tythes and Offerings, such Lecturers and Trencher-Chaplains had been fed and cherished. For the better understanding whereof, we are to know, That in the year 1228. <hi>Roger Niger</hi> Bishop of <hi>London</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ordained by a Synodical Constitution, <hi>That the Citizens should pay of every pounds Rent by the year, of all Houses, Shops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Sum of</hi> 3 s. 5 d. <hi>as time out of mind had formerly been paid.</hi> Which 3 <hi>s.</hi> 5 <hi>d.</hi> did arise from the Offerings upon every <hi>Sunday</hi> and thirty of the principal Holydays in the same year, after the Rate of one halspeny for every twenty shillings Rent of their Houses, Shops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Order of <hi>Roger Niger</hi> remaining in force till the year 1397. and the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>gy being kept to such Rates for the Rents of Houses, as at the first making of the same, it was decreed by <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Canterbury, That as the Rent increased, so the Offerings or Tythes should increase also; That the said Order should be read in every Parish-Church four times in the year, and a Curse laid upon all those who should not obey it.</hi> Confirmed by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> vii. and <hi>Nicholas</hi> v. with a <hi>Proviso, That the said Oblations should be paid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true yearly value of the Shops and Houses.</hi> It so remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until the twenty fifth year of <hi>Henry</hi> viii. at what time many of the former Holydays being abrogated by the Kings Authority, the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Profit of the Clergy found a great abatement; the greater, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the variances which arose betwixt them and their Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, about the payment of their Dues; the People taking the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of some Disorders which the Clergy at that present had been brought unto, by acknowledging the King for the Supream Head of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Upon this variance a Complaint is made unto the King, who refers the whole matter to <hi>Cranmer</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury, Audley</hi> Lord Chancellor, <hi>Gardiner</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winton, Cromwell</hi> Chief <hi>Secretary</hi> of <hi>Estate, Fitz-Iames</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> Chief Justices of the several Benches, by whom it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>That from thenceforth</hi> 2 s. 9 d. <hi>only should be paid out of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:54785:144"/>
every pound for the Rents of Houses, Shops,</hi> &amp;c. And to this Order the Citizens did not only consent, as they had good reason, but bound themselves by an Act of Common Council to perform the same; the said Decree confirmed by Act of Parliament in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty seventh, and afterwards in the thirty seventh of that King, with a power given to the Lord Mayor to commit to Prison every person whatsoever who should not pay his Tythes and Dues according to that Proportion.</p>
                  <p>But contrary to the true intent and meaning of the said Decrees, and the several Acts of Parliament which confirmed the same, the covetous and unconscionable Landlords, who had the Fee-simple, or some long Leases at the least, of such shops and houses, devised many base and fraudulent waies to put a cheat upon the Law, and abuse the Clergie; reserving some small sum in the name of a Rent, and covenanting for other greater Sums to be paid quarterly or half yearly in the name of Fines, Annuities, Pensions, Incomes, Interest money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Finding these Payments so conditioned and agreed upon to be too visible a cheat, some were so wise as to take their Fines in gross, when they sealed their Leases, some inconsiderable Rent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charged upon them; others so cunning as to have two Leases on foot at the same time, one at a low contemptible Rent to gull the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent of his dues, the other with a Rent four or five times as great to keep down the Tenant; and some by a more cleanly kind of conveyance (reserving a small Rent as others did) caused their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants to enter into several bonds for the payment of so much money yearly with reference to the term which they had in their Leases. By which Devises and deceits the house-Rents were reduced to so low a value, that some Aldermen, who do not use to dwell in Sheds and Cottages, could be charged with no more than twenty shillings for a whole years Tythe; the Rent reserved amounts after that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion but to seven pounds yearly. The Clergie by the Alteration of Religion had lost those great advantages, which had before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued unto them by <hi>Obits, Mortuaries, Obventions</hi> to the Shrines and Images of some special Saints, Church Lands, and personal Tythes according to mens honest gain, which last was thought to have amounted to more than the Tythe of houses. Being deprived of the one, and abused in the other, they were forced in the sixteenth of King <hi>Iames, Anno</hi> 1618. to have recourse to the Court of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, by the Barons whereof it was declared, that according to the true intent of the said Acts the Inhabitants of <hi>London</hi> and the Liberties thereof ought to pay the Tythe of their houses, shops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after the rate of two shillings nine pence in the pound proportionable to the true yearly value of the Rent thereof. In order whereunto it was then ordered by the Court, that a Shed, which had been built and made a convenient dwelling house, should pay twenty four shillings nine pence yearly in the name of a Tythe, as was afterwards awarded by Sir <hi>Henry Yelverton,</hi> upon a reference made unto him,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54785:145"/>
that one <hi>Rawlins,</hi> who paid forty shillings yearly to his Landlord in the name of a Rent, and twelve pound by the name of a fine, should from thenceforth pay his Tythe to the Incumbent of the Parish in which he dwelt, after the rate of fourteen pound yearly.</p>
                  <p>This and the like Arbitrements about that time gave them some hope of finding more relief from the Court of Exchequer than they could expect from the Lord Mayor; who being at the first made Judge in the business for the ease of the Clergy, carried himself rather like a party concerned in it than an equal Umpire. But there was no contending with the Purse of the City; For though the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the City Landlords were declared to be unjust and Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous under the hands of many Bishops, and most of the Heads of Houses in both Universities, <hi>Anno</hi> 1620. yet the business going on from bad to worse, they were necessitated to cast themselves at the feet of King <hi>Charles,</hi> and to petition for a remedy of these growing mischiefs, which otherwise in some tract of time might become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable. Which Petition being taken into consideration by his Sacred Majesty, he was graciously pleased to refer the same to the Lord Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry,</hi> the Earl Marshal, the Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> Mr. Secretary <hi>Windebank,</hi> and Chief Justice <hi>Richardson,</hi> or any five, or three of them, of which the Lord Archbishop to be alwaies one, requiring, and thereby authorizing to call before them all parties concerned in the business, and after a full hearing and examination thereof, to end if they could, or otherwise to report to his Majesty where the Impediment lay, that so his Majesty might take such fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order therein as in his Princely wisdom he should think most meet. Which reference, being made the fifteenth of <hi>May</hi> of this present year, was carried on with such equality, and moderation, that the rich Landlords had no reason to complain of any obliquity or partiality in the conduct of it: But having been accustomed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eed on the Churches Bread, and to have the poor Clergie obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous them, they could with no patience entertain the thoughts of relinquishing their former dyet, or suffer a deserving Clergy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their own. Nothing more feared, than that the Clergy by this means would grow too rich; They who conceived two thousand pound of yearly Rent not enough for an Alderman, think one hundred pound <hi>per annum</hi> (as was affirmed by one of that number) to be too much for a Minister. And should the Clergy once grow rich they would become more absolute, and independent, not so obsequious to them as they had been formerly, and consequently more apt to cross them in their opposition or neglect of establisht Orders. And in this state the business stood when <hi>Iuxon</hi> the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> was advanced to the Treasurers Staff in the end of <hi>March</hi> 1635. which much encreast the hopes of the one, and the fears the other. Some of the Clergie had the hap to better their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and improve their Benefices by the appearing of so many
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54785:145"/>
powerful persons in their behalf; and possible enough it is that some expedient would have been resolved on by the Refer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ees to the general content of both parties (his Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi> being very sollicitous in behalf of the Clergy) if the troubles which brake out soon after in <hi>Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So frequently have the best designs been overthrown, not so much by the puissance and might of the adverse party, as through defect of Constancy and Resolution to go through with them.</p>
                  <p>Mention was made in the Narrative of our Archbishops late pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding against the Congregations of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which was done in order to it, in the <hi>Metropolitical</hi> Visitation of the Province of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Concerning which we are to know, that in the beginning of the year 1634. he resolved upon that Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And having some distrust of <hi>Brent</hi> his Vicar General, he pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared one of his Confidents to be a joynt Commissioner with him, that he might do no hurt, if he did no good. But afterwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more assured of <hi>Brent</hi> than before he was, he resolved to trust him with himself, and not to fetter him with any such constant Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer to attend his actings. The Articles for his Visitation, Printed for the use of Churchwardens and Sides-men in their several Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, had little in them more than <hi>ordinary.</hi> But he had given di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to his Vicar General to enquire into the observation of his Majesties Instructions of the year 1629. to command the said Churchwardens to place the Communion Table under the Eastern Wall of the Chancel, where formerly the Altar stood; to set a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Raile before it to avoid profaneness; and at the Raile the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants to receive the blessed Sacrament. It had been signified to the Archbishop, that a Dog in one place or other (but I remember not the name) had run away with the Bread appointed for the holy Communion; and that the Communion Wine had been brought unto the Table in many places, in Pint-pots and Bottles, and so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed to the people. The placing of a Raile before the Table would prevent all infamies of the first sort, and he hoped the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters would take order to reform abuses of the last. <hi>Williams,</hi> at that time Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> had placed the Table of his own Chappel in the state of an <hi>Altar,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Table stood in the same posture in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> of which he was both Bishop and Residentiary; and in the <hi>Collegiate</hi> Church of <hi>Westminster,</hi> whereof he was Dean. The Chancel of St. <hi>Martins</hi> C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as were fitting for it, and then to place therein their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Table, all whicn they accordingly performed. But understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Order of the third of <hi>November,</hi> made by his Majesty and the Lords of his Council in the Case of St. <hi>Gregories,</hi> he untwisteth all this Line again. For a Certificate being presented to him by the Vicar, Church-wardens, and some others of the Parish, <hi>That the place where the Table stood before, was far more fit, by reason of the more capacity to receive the Communicants, and the more audibleness of the Ministers voice, and the Proximity of it to the place where Morning and Evening Prayer had been appointed to be read, than the Chancel was; he gave them leave to remove the Communion Table to the place where it formerly stood, especially at such times as they received the Communion.</hi> All which by his Letters of the nineteenth of <hi>December</hi> 1633. he signifies to <hi>Burden,</hi> one of <hi>Lambs</hi> Surrogates in the <hi>Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conry</hi> of <hi>Leicester, requiring him not to be troublesome or molestfull to the said parties in any thing concerning the Premises.</hi> Which Letter <hi>Burden</hi> sends to <hi>Lamb,</hi> and <hi>Lamb</hi> communicates to his <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; who thereupon resolves to make that Diocess the Scene of his first Visitation.</p>
                  <p>The Diocess of <hi>Lincoln</hi> was anciently larger than it is, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick of <hi>Ely</hi> being taken out of it in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the First, <hi>Anno</hi> 1109. and those of <hi>Oxon.</hi> and <hi>Peterborough</hi> by King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Eighth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1541. But as it is, it is the largest of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, both for the quantity of ground, and the number of Parishes, containing in it the whole Counties of <hi>Lincoln, Leicester, Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Bedford, Huntington,</hi> and that part of <hi>Hertfordshire</hi> which belonged to the Kingdom of <hi>Mercia.</hi> In which Counties are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained 1255 Parishes divided (though not equally) between six Archdeacons, that is to say, the Archdeacons of <hi>Lincoln, How, Leicester, Buckingham, Bedford,</hi> and <hi>Huntingdon</hi>; each of them having his several <hi>Commissaries,</hi> and every <hi>Commissary</hi> one or more <hi>Surrogates,</hi> to officiate under him in times of necessary absence. Within this great Diocess he begins, first laying a Suspension on the Bishop and the six Archdeacons, by which they were inhibited from the exercise of their Jurisdiction, as long as that Visitation lasted. And after sending out a Citation to all the Ministers and Churchwardens of that Diocess, he required them to appear at certain times and places before his Vicar General and the rest of the Commissioners authorized for the several Archdeaconries of the same. But the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop was too stout to yield at the first assault, pretending an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from such Visitations by old <hi>Papall Bulls.</hi> The Archbishop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herewith startled, was not long after very well satisfied in that particular, by a Paper which was tendred to him, asserting his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan Right against those Pretences, collected out of Histories and old Records. Which being compared with the Originals, and found to contain nothing but undoubted truths, the Bishop is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to appear before the Lords of the Council, where his
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:54785:146"/>
                     <hi>Papal Bulls</hi> were so well baited by the Archbishop and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, that not being able to hold any long play, they ran out of the Field, leaving the Bishop to shift for himself as well as he could. This Bar removed, the <hi>Vicar-General</hi> proceeds to the Visitation, and in all places gives command to the Church-wardens, not only to return their Presentments, according to the Articles of the Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but to transpose the Communion Table to the East end of the Chancel, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ence it with a decent Rail, to avoid prophaneness, according unto such Directions as he had received from the Lord Archbishop. He further signified, That they were to take especial care of certifying the names of all the <hi>Lecturers</hi> in their several and respective Parishes; as also, Whether the said <hi>Lecturers,</hi> and all other Preaching Ministers within that Diocess, did carefully observe his Majesties Instructions published in the year 1629. Their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in which Particulars, with a Certificate of their doings about the removing of the <hi>Communion Table,</hi> together with their Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the several Articles which were given them in charge, to be returned unto him by a time appointed. Which Charge thus given, and the Visitation carried to another Diocess, he leaves the prosecution of it (as afterwards in all other places) to the care of the Bishop. But the Bishop having other designs of his own, was no sooner dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of that Suspension which was laid upon him, but he resolves to visit his Diocess in person, to shew himself to those of his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and gain the good affections of those especially who adhered to <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Geneva</hi>: Insomuch that meeting in the Archdeaconry of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> with one Doctor <hi>Bret,</hi> a very grave and reverend man, but one who was supposed to incline that way, he embraced him in his Episcopal Arms with these words of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> viz. <hi>Quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis Episcopus major est Presbytero, Augustinus tamen minor est Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymo:</hi> Intimating thereby, to the great commendation of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty amongst those of that Faction, That the said <hi>Bret</hi> was as much greater than <hi>Williams,</hi> as the Bishop was above a Priest. And in compliance with that Party, he gave command for Railing in the Communion Table (as appears by the Extract of his Proceedings in the Archdeaconry of <hi>Leicester</hi>) not placed at the East end of the Chancel, with a Rail before it: but in the middle thereof, as it stood before, with a Rail about it. And by that kind of half-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, as he retracted nothing from his own Opinion, in his Letter to the Vicar of <hi>Grantham</hi>; so he conceived, That he had finely fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated the design of his Metropolitan, and yet not openly proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against his Injunction.</p>
                  <p>The Visitation thus begun,<note place="margin">1635.</note> was carried on from year to year, till it had gone over all the Diocesses in the Province of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> In the prosecution whereof, the <hi>Vicar-General</hi> having given the Charge, and allowed time to the Church-wardens to return a Certificate of their doings in pursuance of it, the further execution of it was left to the Bishops in their several Diocesses; in which it went forwards

more or less, as the Bishops were of spirit and affection to advance the Work, either in reference to the transposing of the <hi>Table,</hi> or the observation of his Majesties <hi>Instructions</hi> above-mentioned, which had not the least place in the business of this Visitation. <hi>Wright</hi> Bishop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield</hi> having given order by his Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor for the transposing of the Tables in most parts of his Diocess, began at last to cast his eyes on the Churches of the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> and St. <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Archangel</hi> in the City of <hi>Coventry;</hi> concerning which he prescribed these Orders: 1. <hi>That the Ground at the upper end of the Chancells be handsomly raised by three steps, that the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Sacrament may be conspicuous to all the Church.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Ground so raised at both Churches, the Communion-Table should be removed close to the East-wall of the Chancels.</hi> 3. <hi>That in both Churches all new Additions of Seats in the Chancels be taken away, and the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ws there reduced as near as may be to the ancient form.</hi> But the Citizens of <hi>Coventry</hi> found a way to take off his edge, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that he had received not only his Majesties Command, but encouragements also in pursuance of it (his Majesty spending at the least a fortnight in that Diocess, in the year 1636. at such time as the Bishop came to wait upon him in <hi>Tutbury</hi> Castle): For they so far prevailed upon him at his being in <hi>Coventry,</hi> that in the presence of the Mayor and some others of the Fraternity, he appointed, That the Communion-Table should be removed from its ascent of three Steps, unto the Body of the Chancel, during the Administration of the Blessed Sacrament, commanding <hi>Bird,</hi> who had the Officiality of the place, not to trouble them in it. <hi>Bird</hi> not being well pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with so much levity in the Bishop, gives notice of it unto <hi>Latham</hi> the Bishops Register in <hi>Lichfield,</hi> by whom it was signified to <hi>Lamb,</hi> by <hi>Lamb</hi> to the Archbishop, and by him to the King; from whom it is to be supposed that the Bishop could receive small thanks for his disobedience. In <hi>Essex</hi> the business met with a greater difficulty. <hi>Aylet</hi> Official there under the Chancellor of <hi>London,</hi> had caused many of the Communion Tables within the verge of his Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be transposed and railed in, and the People to come up and kneel and receive at the Rail. Opposed at first in some of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Towns, because they found it otherwise in the Churches of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> whose example they conceived might be a sufficient warrant for them in that particular: But much more were they moved to stand out against him, upon sight of one of the Articles for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitical Visitation, by which they conceived that they had leave to remove their Table at the time of Celebration, and place it as it might be most convenient for the Parishioners to come about it and receive the Sacrament. <hi>Aylet</hi> complains of this to <hi>Lamb,</hi> finding himself thereby under an imputation of crossing the Article delivered by his Graces <hi>Visitors,</hi> and following after his own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without any Authority. For remedy whereof, and to save all that he had done from returning back again to the same estate in
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:54785:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which he found it, he desires to know his Graces Pleasure and <hi>Lambs</hi> Directions. More constantly, and with better fortune, is the business carried on by <hi>Pierce</hi> in his Diocess of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells.</hi> No sooner had his Majesty signified his Pleasure in the Case of St. <hi>Gregories,</hi> but he issueth out a Commission to some of his Clergy, to inquire into the State of all the Parish Churches within that Diocess; and on the return of their Account, gives Order for the rectifying of such things as they found amiss, especially in the posture of the Holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And that it might be seen, that his Commands were not only countenanced by Power, but backed by Reason, he prepares certain Motives and Considerations to perswade Conformity; as, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>That it was Ordered by the Queens</hi> Injunctions, That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Table should stand where the Altar did. 2. <hi>That there should be some difference between the placing of the</hi> Lords Table <hi>in the Church, and the placing of a</hi> Mans Table <hi>in his House.</hi> 3. <hi>That it was not fit the People should sit above Gods Table, or be above the Priest when he Consecrateth.</hi> 4. <hi>That when the Communion Table stands thus, the Chancel would be the fairer, and so there would be more room for the Communicants.</hi> 5. <hi>That the Table standing thus, the face of the Minister would be better seen, and his voice more audibly and distinctly heard, than if it stood upon a Level in the midst of the Chancel.</hi> And 6. <hi>That it was expedient that the Daughters should be like their Mother, and that the</hi> Parochial <hi>Churches should conform themselves in that particular to their own</hi> Cathedrals. But that which seemed to be the most popular Argument to perswade Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, was the avoiding of those Prophanations which formerly the Holy Table had been subject to; <hi>For should it be permitted to stand as before it did, Church-wardens would keep their Accounts on it, Parishioners would dispatch the Parish business at it, School-Masters will teach their Boys to Write upon it, The Boys will lay their Hats, Sachels, and Books upon it, Many will sit and lean irreverently against it in Sermon time, The Dogs would piss upon it and defile it, and Glasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would knock it full of Nail-holes.</hi> By which means he prevailed so far, that of 469 Parishes which were in that Diocess, 140 had conformed to his Order in it, before the end of the <hi>Christmas</hi> Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days in this present year, <hi>Anno</hi> 1635. without any great reluctancy in Priest or People. The first strong Opposition which he found in the business, came from a great and populous Parish called <hi>Beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington,</hi> where <hi>Hewish</hi> Incumbent of the place, was willing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to have obeyed his Directions in it: but the Church-wardens of the Parish were determined otherwise. For this being sent for by the Bishop, he gave them Order by word of mouth, to remove the Table to the East end of the Chancel, and to place a decent Rail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it: Which they refusing to perform, were cited to appear in the Bishops Court, before <hi>Duck</hi> the Chancellor of that Diocess, on the ninth of <hi>Iune,</hi> by whom they were commanded to remove such Seats as were above the Communion Table, to obey the Bishops
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:54785:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
former Directions, and to return a Certificate of all that they had done therein by the sixth of <hi>October</hi> then next following: and for default thereof, were on the same day Excommunicated by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop in person. But the Church-wardens being rich, well-backed, and disaffected to the Service, appealed from their Diocesan to the Dean of the <hi>Arches</hi>; at whose request, upon some hope given of their Conformity, they were absolved for a Month, and admonish'd to submit to that which had been enjoined them. Continuing in their obstinacy, he Excommunicates them again, and they again ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Dean of the <hi>Arches</hi>; where finding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o Relief, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented a Petition to the Archbishop, with no less than a hundred hands unto it, and afterwards to the King himself, but with like suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. <hi>Pierce</hi> had done nothing in that case, but what he had been warranted to do by their Authority, and therefore was by their Authority to be countenanced in it. There is an ancient Priviledge belonging to the Church of <hi>England, That he who standeth obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Excommunicated for forty days, upon Certificate thereof into the Court of</hi> Chancery, <hi>shall be attached with a Writ</hi> De excommunicato capiendo, <hi>directed to the Sheriff, for his Apprehension; by him to be committed to Prison without Bail or Mainprise</hi> (as our Lawyers call it) <hi>till he conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rm himself, and seek Absolution.</hi> By virtue of this Writ these obstinate persons were laid up in the Common Gaol, after they had remained Excommunicate above a twelvemonth; which shews with how great patience they had been forborn. And then at last, perceiving what ill counsel they had followed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what perplexities they had cast themselves, they made their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to their Bishop, by whom they were enjoined to do Penance for their Contempt, and obstinate standing out against the Sentence of the Court, in a form prescribed: The Penance to be done in the great Church of <hi>Bath,</hi> their own Parish Church at <hi>Beckington,</hi> and in the Parish Church of <hi>Frome-Selwood</hi> the next Market-Town ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining to it; and thereupon the Parties to be Absolved. Which Opposition thus suppressed, prepared the People in most other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that Diocess for a more ready conformity, than otherwise the <hi>Diocesan</hi> might have found amongst them: So true is that of the Historian, <hi>That the Resistancies of the Subject being once suppressed, add strength to that Authority which they sought to crush.</hi> How he behaved himself in reference to his Majesties <hi>Instructions,</hi> we shall see hereafter, when he is brought upon the stage on that occasion; and we shall see hereafter also, how much or how little was done in order to the purpose of this <hi>Visitation,</hi> by the rest of the Bishops.</p>
                  <p>Nor was there only care taken for rectifying such things as were found amiss in <hi>Parochial</hi> Churches: but to inquire also into the State and Actions of the Mother <hi>Cathedrals,</hi> by which all other Churches which depended on them, were to be regulated and directed. And they found work enough in many of them; especially in those W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erein there was a want of Statutes for the Common Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:54785:148"/>
There are in <hi>England</hi> twenty six <hi>Cathedral</hi> or Episcopal Sees, of which thirteen are reckoned of the old foundation, and the other moyety of the new; those of the old foundation such as anciently had been founded in <hi>Secular Canons,</hi> as they still continue. Of which sort are the Churches of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> together with those of <hi>Chichester, Salisbury, Wells, Exeter, Lincoln, Lichfield, Hereford,</hi> and the four <hi>Welsh</hi> Bishopricks, in the Province of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and none but the Metropolitical See of <hi>York</hi> in the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, all of which had their ancient Statutes, and required no alteration in them except <hi>Hereford</hi> only. Those of the new founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as they commonly called them) were such as had been foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on <hi>Monastick</hi> Orders, which being dissolved by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, he founded them a new in a Dean and Chapter of <hi>Secular</hi> Priests, of which sort were the Churches of <hi>Canterbury, Winchester, Ely, Worcester, Rochester, Norwich,</hi> and the four new Bishopricks by him founded in the Abbeys of <hi>Oxon. Peterborough, Glocester,</hi> and <hi>Bristol,</hi> together with those of <hi>Durham, Carlisle,</hi> and <hi>Chester,</hi> (this last of his foundation also) in the other <hi>Province.</hi> For each of which Churches there was made a draught of Statutes, but never perfected or confirmed; and therefore either kept or broken at the <hi>Deans</hi> discretion, as it conduced most to his advantage from time to time; which proved the unavoydable occasion of many differences between the <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Prebendaries</hi> of those several Churches; the <hi>Deans</hi> affecting an arbitrary and absolute Government, and the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends</hi> looking on themselves as Brethren, not as Subjects to him. The perfecting of these Statutes to serve as a standing Rule to both for the times succeeding, took up much of his thoughts, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he had effected it for all those Churches in convenient time, if the disturbances which hapned in <hi>Scotland</hi> first, and in <hi>England</hi> afterwards, had not diverted and disabled him from that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
                  <p>He began first with <hi>Canterbury</hi> his own <hi>Cathedral,</hi>

                     <hi>That the Communion Table was not very decent, and the Raile before it worse; that the Organs were old and naught, and that the Copes and Vestments were imbezeled, and none remained.</hi> From <hi>Norwich, That the Hangings of the Choires were old, and the Copes fair, but wanted mending.</hi> From <hi>Glocester, That there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Copes, and that many things were grown amiss since he left that</hi> Deanry. From <hi>Lichfield, That the Furniture of the Altar was very mean, care therefore to be taken in it for more costly Ornaments.</hi> The like account from other places, which drew on by degrees such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in Cathedral Churches that they recovered once again their ancient splendour, and served for an example to the Parish Churches which related to them. Nor did the Archbishop stand alone in point of judgment as to these particulars. He had therein the testimony and assent of two such Bishops then which there could be none more averse from Popery, or any thing that tended to it. A difference hapning between the Minister and Church-wardens in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish of <hi>Wilts,</hi> about the placing of the Table, which the Minister desired to transpose to the end of the Chancell, and the Church-wardens to keep it as it stood before, the business was referred to <hi>Davenant,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who on a full consideration of the matter, declared in favour of the <hi>Incumbent,</hi> and by a Decree under his Episcopal Seal settled the Table in the place where the Altar stood, as the Minister desired to have it. In which Decree there are these two passages to be observed;<note place="margin">Archb. Sp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Iune</hi> 16. 1637.</note> First, <hi>That by the Injunction of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>and by Canon</hi> 32 <hi>under King</hi> James, <hi>the Communion-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles should ordinarily be set and stand with the side to the East Wall of the Chancel.</hi> And secondly, <hi>That it is ignorance to think that the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the holy Table in that place doth relish of Popery.</hi> This for the placing of the Table. And then as for the bowing and adoring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it, we have this Authority from the Pen of <hi>Morton,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> in a Book by him written of the <hi>Romish Sacrifice.</hi>
                     <q>The like difference (saith he) may be discerned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their manner of Reverence in <hi>bowing</hi> towards the <hi>Altar</hi> for adoration of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> only, and ours in <hi>bowing</hi> as well when there is no <hi>Eucharist</hi> on the Table as when there is, which is not to the Table of the Lord, but to the Lord of the Table, to testifie the Communion of all the faithful Communicants therewith, even as the people of God did in adoring him before the <hi>Arke his footstoole,</hi> Psalm 99.</q>
And here we also may observe, that though <hi>Davenant</hi> made not his Decree till the seventeenth of <hi>May</hi> 1637. when the business of the Table had been settled in most parts of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:54785:150"/>
the Kingdom, yet <hi>Mortons</hi> book came out this year, <hi>Anno</hi> 1635. at the first breaking out of those oppositions which were made against it.</p>
                  <p>Yet did not the Archbishop think he had done sufficiently if he should leave the case to be ruled only by Injunctions and Decrees, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he added vigour to them by his own example. When he was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of S. <hi>Davids,</hi> he built a new Chappel to his House of <hi>Aberguilly,</hi> and furnished both the Chappel and the Altar in it with <hi>Hangings, Palls, Fronts, Plate,</hi> and other Utensils, to a very great value. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto which beginning he continued till the end of his Race. When he came first to <hi>Lambeth</hi>-house, where he found the <hi>Chappel lye so nastily,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cant. Doom,</hi> p. 462.</note> (as his own words are) the Windows so defaced, and all things in it so disordered, <hi>that he was much ashamed to see it, and could not resort unto it without disdain</hi>; the Images in the Windows being broken in many places, and most deformedly patcht up with ordinary Glass, he caused to be repaired, and beautified according to their former Figure, his Glasiers Bill amounting to no less than 148 <hi>li.</hi> 7 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> With like care, but with far less Charges, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired the ruined Windows in the Chappel of his house in <hi>Croyden,</hi> where he spent the greatest part of his Summers, and whither he retired at other times for his ease and privacy. And as for the Communion Table, which he found standing in the middle of the Chappel, a very sorry one in it self, he ordered it to be removed to some other Room,<note place="margin">p. 66.</note> and caused a new one to be made, placed where the Altar sometimes stood, shadowed over-head with a very fair Frieze, and fenced with a decent and costly Raile, the guilding of the one, and the curious workmanship of the other, together with the Table it self, amounting to 33 pounds, and upwards; <hi>Copes, Altar-cloaths, Plate,</hi> and other necessaries which belonged to the adorning of it he had been Master of before in his other Chappels, and therefore was it the less charge in compleating this. He put himself to some cost also in repairing and beautifying the Organs, which he found very much out of tune, and made great use of them in the celebrating of Divine Service on Sundaies and Holidaies, when his leisure could permit him to be present at it; some Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of his Majesties Chappel assisting many times to make up the Consort when the solemnity required it. According unto which example of their Lord, and Chancellor, the principal Colledges in <hi>Oxon.</hi> beautified their Chappels, transposed their Tables, fenced them with Railes, and furnished them with Hangings, Palls, Plate, and all other necessaries. Yet neither his own Example, nor the Authority of the said two Bishops, nor practice of the Deans and Chapters in so many Churches, or the Governours of those princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Colledges, so stopt the mouths of divers railing <hi>Rabshakehs</hi> of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, as not to spit their venome and reproaches on them. Witness for all, that scurrilous passage of <hi>H. B.</hi> in his seditious Sermon,<note place="margin">p. 163.</note> called, <hi>For God and the King; How then</hi> (saith he) <hi>will our

new Masters, our Innovators, make good the bringing in of these things afresh into Cathedrals, and forcing all petty Churches to conform thereunto? Would the Prelates thus make the Mother Cathedrals (thus by themselves made and adopted</hi> Romes <hi>daughters) their Concubines, whereon to beget a new bastard Generation of sacrificing, idolatrous, Mass-Priests throughout the Land, which our good Laws, and all our learned and pious Divines have proclaimed illegitimate?</hi> So he. More of this foul stuff might be found elsewhere, but that I hate the raking in such dirty puddles.</p>
                  <p>The business of the Table going on in so good a way, that of the Declaration about Lawful Sports seemed to be at a stand. Such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters as had readily obeyed the Mandates, and published the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Orders of the secular Judges in their several Churches, did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately refuse the publishing of this Declaration, when required to do it by their Bishops; and that they might not be thought to stand out against them without some good ground, they alledged some reasons for themselves, which when they came to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, had no reason in them. First, they alledged, That there was no express order in the Declaration, that the Minister of the Parish should be prest to the publishing of it. But then withall they should consider, that the Bishops were commanded to take order for the publishing of it in their several Parishes; and whom could they require to publish it in the Parish Churches but the Ministers only? Bound to them by an Oath of <hi>Canonical obedience</hi> at their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to their Cures. So that the Bishops did no more than they were commanded in laying the publication of this <hi>Declaration</hi> on the back of the Ministers; and the Ministers by doing less than they were commanded infringed the Oath which they had taken, rendring themselves thereby obnoxious to all such Ecclesiastical Censures as the Bishops should inflict upon them. It was alledged secondly, That the publishing of this Declaration was a work more proper for the Constable or Tything-man, or the Church-wardens at the least, than it was for the Ministers: But then it was to be considered, that the <hi>Constable</hi> or <hi>Tything-man</hi> were Lay-officers meerly, bound by the Law to execute the Warrants of the Judges and Justices, but not the Mandates of the Bishops, so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Proper Instruments</hi> in such a business, that none of the Judges thought it fit to command their Service in publishing their Orders against <hi>Ales</hi> and <hi>Revels.</hi> And though the Church-wardens had some relation to Church-matters, and consequently to the Bishop in the way of Presentments; yet was he not bound to execute any such Commands, because not tyed by an Oath of Canonical obedience, as the Ministers were. Or were it otherwise, yet doth it happen many times in Country Villages, that the Church-wardens cannot read, and therefore not to be imployed in publishing such Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which require a more knowing man than a silly Villager. And last of all it was alledged, that the Ministers of all others
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:54785:151"/>
were most unfit to hold the Candle for lighting and letting in such a course of licenciousness, as was indulged on the Lords day, by the said Declaration. But then it was to have been proved, that any of the Sports allowed of in it, might have been brought within the compass of such Licentiousness, which neither the Word of God, nor the Canons of the Christian Church, nor any Statutes of the Realm had before forbidden. Or had it been as they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Command was contrary to the Law of God, and could not be obeyed with a sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e conscience; yet this was only a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, their reading of the Book being no more an argument of their approbation of any thing therein contained, than when a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Crier reads a Proclamation, the Contents whereof perhaps he likes not.</p>
                  <p>The Business being at this stand, it was thought fit that the Bishops should first deal with the Refusers in a Fatherly and gentle way, but adding menaces sometimes to their perswasions if they saw cause for it; and that in the mean season some discourses should be writ and published to bring them to a right understanding of the truth, and their several duties: which burden being held of too great weight for any one to undergo, and the necessity of the work requiring a quick dispatch, it was held fit to divide the imployment betwixt two. The Argumentative and Scholasticall part referred to the right learned Dr. <hi>White,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> who had given good proof of his ability in Polemical matters in several Books and Disputations against the Papists. The Practical and Historical, by <hi>Heylyn</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> who had gained some reputation for his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in the ancient Writers by <hi>Asserting</hi> the History of S. <hi>George,</hi> mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously impugned by those of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Party upon all occasions. Both of them, being enjoyned their tasks, were required to be ready for the Press against <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term; at the end whereof both books came out, The Bishops under the Title of <hi>A Treatise of the Sabbath day, containing a defence of the Orthodoxal Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England <hi>against Sabbatarian Novelty,</hi> The other called, <hi>The History of the Sabbath,</hi> was divided into two Books or Parts; The first whereof began with the Creation of the World, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on the Story till the destruction of the Temple; The second, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with our Saviour Christ and his Apostles, was drawn down to the year 1633. when the publishing of this Declaration was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. But going different waies to work they did not both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the like success. The Bishops Book had not been extant very long, when an Answer was returned unto it by <hi>Byfield</hi> of <hi>Surrey,</hi> which Answer occasioned a <hi>Reply,</hi> and that <hi>Reply</hi> begat a <hi>Rejoynder.</hi> To <hi>Heylyns</hi> Book there was no Answer made at all, whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause unanswerable, or not worth the Answering, is to me unknown. And though it is not to be doubted, but that the Arguments of the one, and the Authorities of the other, prevailed with some to lay aside their former obstinacy and averseness; yet did there still
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:54785:151"/>
remain too many, who stopp'd their ears, like the <hi>deaf Adder</hi> in the <hi>Psalmist, and would not hear the voice of the Charmers, charmed they never so sweetly.</hi> By which it did appear too plainly, That there was some <hi>Association</hi> had and made amongst them, to stand it out to the last, and put some baffle or affront upon their Superiors, by whose Command the reading of the Book was imposed upon them. And thereupon it was resolved, That the Bishops in their several Diocesses should go to work more roundly with them, and either bring them to Conformity, if it might be done; or otherwise, to proceed against them by <hi>Ecclesiastical Censures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whilst these things were acting on the Stage of <hi>England,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> were as active in drawing of a Book of <hi>Canons,</hi> and framing a Publick <hi>Liturgie</hi> for the use of that Church. Both Undertakings warranted by the Act of a <hi>General Assembly</hi> held at <hi>Aberdeen, Anno</hi> 1616. and the one brought to a good forwardness before the death of King <hi>Iames</hi>: But being discontinued by the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and Debates before-remembred, it pleased his Majesty at the last to yield unto the importunity of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Bishops, in having a <hi>Liturgie</hi> of their <hi>own,</hi> differing in some things from that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to shew the independency and self-subsistence of their <hi>Kirk</hi>; but agreeing with it in the main, to testifie the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity between the Churches: Which being thus condescended to, they were ordered to proceed with all speed and diligence, which they did accordingly. But the <hi>Canons</hi> being the shorter work, were first brought to an end; for the compiling whereof, his Majesty gives these Reasons in his large Declaration. First, <hi>That he held it but exceeding necessary, that there should be some Book extant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Rules of the Ecclesiastical Government; so that as well the Clergy as the Laity might have one certain standing Rule, to regulate the Power of the one, the Obedience and Practise of the other.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That the Acts of General Assemblies were Written only, and not Printed; and therefore could not come to the knowledge of many: So large and voluminous, that it was not easie to Transcribe them, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that few of the Presbyters themselves could tell which of them were authentical, which not: So unsafely and uncertainly kept, that they knew not where to address themselves for consulting with them: That by reducing those numerous Act, (and those not known unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) to such a paucity of Canons, published and exposed to the publick view, no man should be insnared by ignorance, or have just reason to complain of their multiplicity.</hi> And finally, <hi>That not one in all that Kingdom did either live under the Obedience of the Acts of those</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assemblies, <hi>or did know what they were, or where to find them.</hi> Upon which grounds, the Book of <hi>Canons</hi> being drawn up and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to him, he gave a Warrant under his Hand to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> requiring him, together with the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> to peruse the same, to see that they were well fitted to the Church-Government, and as near as conveniently might be to the <hi>Canons</hi> of

                  <p>These <hi>Canons</hi> when they came abroad, were presently quarrelled and disclaimed by the <hi>Scottish Presbyters</hi>: Quarrelled in reference to the subject matter comprehended in them: Disclaimed, because imposed upon them without their own approbation and consent. The points most quarrelled at, were these. 1. <hi>That whosoever should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That the Kings Majesty had not the same Authority in Causes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical, that the Godly Kings had among the</hi> Jews, <hi>or the Christian Emperors in the Primitive Church; or impugn in any part his Royal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:54785:152"/>
in Causes Ecclesiastical, was to incur the Censure of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</hi> 2. <hi>The like Censure to be inflicted on those who should affirm, That the Worship contained in the Book of Common Prayer, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Sacraments</hi> (though at the making of these <hi>Canons</hi> there was no such Book of Common Prayer recommended to them); <hi>or, That the Government of the Church by Archbishops and Bishops, or the form of Making and Consecrating Archbishops and Bishops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>did contain any thing repugnant to the Scriptures, or was corrupt, supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, or unlawful in the Service and Worship of God.</hi> 3. <hi>That the Ordinations were restrained to four times in the year; that is, the first Weeks of</hi> March, June, September, <hi>and</hi> December. 4. <hi>That every Ecclesiastical Person at his Admission should take the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, according to the form required by Parliament; and the like Oath for avoiding</hi> Symonie, <hi>required in the Book of Consecration.</hi> 5. <hi>That every</hi> Presbyter <hi>shall either by himself, or by another Person lawfully called, read or cause Divine Service to be done, according to the form of the Book of that Common Prayer, before all Sermons; and that he should Officiate by the said Book of Common Prayer, in all the Offices, Parts and Rubricks of it</hi> (when as yet none of them had seen the said Book or Liturgie). 6. <hi>That no Preacher should impugn the Doctrine delivered by another in the same Church, or any neer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining to it, without leave from the Bishop</hi>; which they conceived to be the way to pin their whole Religion on the Bishops Sleeves 7. <hi>That no</hi> Presbyter <hi>should hereafter become Surety or Cautioner for any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whosoever, in Civil Bonds and Contracts, under pain of Suspension.</hi> 8. <hi>That whatsoever remained of the Bread and Wine prepared for the Communion, should be distributed to the poorer sort which receive that day, to be eaten and drunken of them before they go out of the Church.</hi> 9. <hi>That</hi> Presbyters <hi>are enjoined to Minister the Sacrament of Baptism in private Houses, and upon every day alike, in case of infirmity; and that the People were required not to receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper but upon their knees.</hi> 10. <hi>That in all Sentences of Separation</hi> a Thoro &amp; Mensa, <hi>there shall be a Caution inserted (and given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly) That the Persons so separated should live continently and chastly, and not contract Marriage with any Person, during each others life</hi> (which seemed to put the innocent Party into as bad a condition as the guilty, contrary to the Judgment of the Reformed Churches). 11. <hi>That no private Meeting be kept by</hi> Presbyters, <hi>or any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whatsoever, for expounding Scripture, or for consulting upon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Ecclesiastical: Such matters to be handled only in the Lawful</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods <hi>held by Bishops.</hi> 12. <hi>That under pain of Excommunication, no</hi> Presbyter <hi>or</hi> Layman, <hi>jointly or severally, make Rules, Orders, or Constitutions in Causes Ecclesiastical; or to add or detract from any Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks or Articles, or other things now established, without the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the King or his Successors.</hi> 13. <hi>That National or General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies were to be called only by the Kings Authority; That the Decrees thereof should bind as well the Absent as the Present in Matters Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical;
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:54785:153"/>
and, That it should not be lawful for the Bishops themselves, in such</hi> Assemblies, <hi>or otherwise, to alter any Articles, Rubrick, Canon Doctrinal or Disciplinary whatsoever, without his Majesties leave first had and obtained.</hi> 14. <hi>That no man should cover his Head in time of Divine Service, except with a Cap or Night-coife in case of infirmity; and that all Persons should reverently kneel when the Confession and other Prayers were read, and should stand up at the saying of the Creed.</hi> 15. <hi>That no</hi> Presbyter <hi>or Reader be permitted to conceive Prayers</hi> ex tempo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Canon of the Church of</hi> England). 17. <hi>That no man should Teach either in Publick School or Private House, but such as shall be allowed by the Archbishop of the Province, or Bishop of the Diocess, under their Hand and Seal; and those to Licence none but such as were of good Religion, and obedient to the Orders of the Church.</hi> 18. <hi>That none should be admitted to read in any Colledge or School, except they take first the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy.</hi> 19. <hi>That nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:54785:153"/>
Realm his own Life may be called in question for concealing the same.</hi> 25. <hi>And finally, That no Person should be received into Holy Orders, nor suffered to Preach, Catechise, Minister the Sacraments, or any other Ecclesiastical Function, unless he first subscribe to be obedient to these present Canons, Ratified and Approved by his Majesties Royal Warrant, and Ordained to be observed by the Clergy, and all others whom they concern.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These were the matters chiefly quarrelled in this Book of <hi>Canons,</hi> visibly tending (as they would make the World believe) to subject that Kirk unto the Power of the King; the Clergy to the command of their Bishops; the whole Nation, to the Discipline of a Foreign Church; and all together by degrees, to the Idolatries and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> But juster cause they seemed to have for disclaiming the said Book of <hi>Canons,</hi> because not made nor imposed upon them by their own approbation and consent, contrary to the usage of the Church in all Times and Ages. Had his Majesty impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed these Orders on them by the name of <hi>Injunctions,</hi> according to the example of King <hi>Henry</hi> viii. <hi>Anno</hi> 1536. of King <hi>Edward</hi> vi. <hi>Anno</hi> 1547. and of Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Anno</hi> 1559. he might perhaps have justified himself by that Supremacy which had been vested in him by the Laws of that Kingdom; which seems to have been the Judgment of King <hi>Iames</hi> in this very case. At his last being in <hi>Scotland, Anno</hi> 1617. he had prepared an Article to be passed in Parliament to this effect,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>viz. That whatsoever his Majesty should determine in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Government of the Church, with the advice of the Archbishop, Bishops, and a competent number of the Ministry, should have the strength of a Law.</hi> But understanding that a Protestation was prepared against it by some of the most Rigid <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> he commanded <hi>Hay</hi> the Clerk or Register, to pass by that Article, as a thing no way necessary;<note place="margin">533.</note> the Prerogative of his Crown giving him more Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than was declared or desired by it. But as for Canons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions Ecclesiastical, if they concerned the whole Church, they were to be advised and framed by Bishops, and other Learned men, assembled in a General Council, and testified by the Subscription of such Bishops as were then assembled. Or if they did relate only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to National Churches, or particular Provinces, they were to be concluded and agreed upon by the Bishops and Clergy; that is to say, so many of the Clergy as are chosen and impowered by all the rest for that end and purpose, assembled in a National or Provincial <hi>Synod.</hi> No Canons nor Constitutions Ecclesiastical to be otherwise made; or if made otherwise, not to bind, without a voluntary and free submission of all Parties to them. And though it could not be denied, but that all Christian Emperours, Kings, and Princes reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Power unto themselves of Ratifying and Confirming all such Constitutions as by the Bishops and Clergy were agreed on; yet still the said Canons and Constitutions were first agreed on by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Clergy, before they were tendred to the Sovereign Prince
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:54785:154"/>
for his Ratification. The <hi>Scottish Presbyters</hi> had formerly disclaimed the Kings Authority either in calling their <hi>Assemblies,</hi> or confirming the Results and Acts thereof; which they conceived to be good and valid of themselves without any additional power of his to add strength unto them. And therefore now they must needs think themselves reduced to a very great vassalage in having a body of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons so imposed upon them, to the making whereof they were never called, and to the passing whereof they had never voted. But as they had broke the Rules of the Primitive Church in acting Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of themselves without requiring the Kings approbation and consent in the times foregoing; so were they now upon the point of having those old Rules broken on them by the King, in making Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and putting Laws and Orders on them for their future Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to which they never had consented. And therefore though his Majesty had taken so much care (as himself observed) for faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litating and conveniencing their obedience,<note place="margin">

                  <p>More clamour, but on weaker grounds, was made against the Book of Common Prayer when it first came out, which was not till the year 1637. and then we shall hear further of it. Mean while we will return to <hi>England,</hi> and see what our Archbishop doth, as a chief Counsellor and States-man in his Civil Actings. It was about four or five years since, <hi>Anno</hi> 1631, that he first discovered how ill his Majesties Treasury had been managed between some principal Officers of his Revenue, to the enriching of themselves, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverishing of their Master, and the no small amazement of all good Subjects. But the abuses being too great to be long concealed, his Majesty is made acquainted with all particulars, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon did much estrange his countenance from the principal of them.</p>
                  <p>For which good service to the King none was so much suspected by them as the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> against whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to practise, endeavouring all they could to remove him from his Majesties ear, or at the least to lessen the esteem and reputation which his fidelity and upright dealing had procured of him. Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are heightned in the Court. Private ends followed to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of Publick Service, and every mouth talkt openly against his proceedings. But still he kept his ground, and prevailed at last, appointed by his Majesty on the fifth of <hi>February</hi> 1634. to be one of the great Committee for Trade and the Kings Revenue; and seeing <hi>Wes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:54785:154"/>
and certain others; who with no small envy looked upon him as if he had been set over them for a Supervisor. Within two daies after his being nominated for this Commission, his Majesty brought him also into the Foreign Committee, which rendred him as considerable abroad as he was at home. This as it added to his power, so it encreased the stomach which was borne against him. The year 1635. was but new began, when clashing began to grow between him and <hi>Cottington</hi> about executing the Commission for the Treasury. And that his grief and trouble might be the greater, his old Friend <hi>Windebank,</hi> who had received his preferment from him, forsook him in the open field, and joyned himself with <hi>Cottington</hi> and the rest of that Party. This could not chuse but put him to the exercise of a great deal of Patience, considering how necessary a friend he had lost, in whose bosome he had lodged a great part of his Counsels, and on whose Activity he relied for the carrying on of his designs at the Council Table. But for all this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And who more like to come into his eye for that prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than <hi>Iuxon,</hi> his old and trusty Friend, then Bishop of <hi>London</hi>; a man of such a well tempered disposition as gave exceeding great content both to Prince and People, and one whom he knew capable of as much instruction as by a whole years experience in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission for the Treasury he was able to give him.</p>
                  <p>It was much wondred at, when first the Staff was put into this mans hand; in doing whereof the Archbishop was generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived neither to have consulted his own present peace, nor his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture safety. Had he studied his own present peace, he should have given <hi>Cottington</hi> leave to put in for it, who being Chancellor of the Exchequer pretended himself to be the next in that <hi>Ascendent,</hi> the Lord Treasurers Associate while he lived, and the presumptive heir to that office after his decease. And had he studied his own safety and preservation for the times to come, he might have made use of the power by recommending the Staff to the Earles of <hi>Bedford, Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Essex,</hi> the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> or some such man of Popular <hi>Nobility</hi>; by whom he might have been reciprocated by their strength and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teress with the People in the change of times. But he preferred his
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:54785:155"/>
Majesties Advantages before his particular concernments, the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Publick before his own. Nor did he want some seasonable considerations in it for the good of the Church. The peace and quiet of the Church depended much on the conformity of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>London</hi> did as much depend in their trade and payments upon the Love and Justice of the Lord <hi>Treasurer</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> This therefore was the more likely way to conform the Citizens to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of their Bishop, and the whole Kingdom unto them; No small encouragement being thereby given to the <hi>London</hi> Clergy for the improving of their Tythes. For with what confidence could any of the old Cheats adventure on a publick Examination in the Court of Exchequer (the proper Court for suits and grievances of that nature) when a Lord Bishop of <hi>London</hi> sate therein as the principal Judge?

It was much feared by some, and hoped by others, that the new <hi>Treasurer</hi> would have sunk under the burden of that place, as <hi>Williams</hi> did under the custody of the Seal: but he deceived them both in that expectation, carrying himself with such an even and steady hand, that every one applauded, but none envied his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it; insomuch as the then Lord <hi>Faulkland,</hi> in a bitter Speech against the Bishops about the beginning of the Long Parliament, could not chuse but give him this faire Testimony, <hi>viz.

That the Queen sent for him to</hi> Oatlands, <hi>and gave him thanks for a business which she had trusted him withall, promising him to be his Friend, and that he should have immediate access to her when he had occasion.</hi> This seconded with the like intimation, given us <hi>May</hi> 18. 1635. of which he writes, that having brought his account to the Queen on <hi>May</hi> 18. <hi>Whitsunday,</hi> the Court then at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> it was put of till the Sunday after, at which time he presented it to her, and received from her an assurance of all that was desired by him. <hi>Panzani's</hi> coming unto <hi>London</hi> in the <hi>Christmas</hi> holydaies makes it not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:54785:155"/>
that the facilitating of his safe and favourable reception was the great business which the Queen had committed to the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops trust; and for his effecting of it with the King, had given him those gracious promises of access unto her, which the <hi>Breviate</hi> spake of. For though <hi>Panzani</hi> was sent over from the Pope on no other pretence than to prevent a Schism which was then like to be made between the <hi>Regulars</hi> and the <hi>Secular</hi> Priests, to the great scandall of that Church; yet under that pretence were muffled ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other designs which were not fit to be discovered unto Vulgar eyes. By many secret Artifices he works himself into the fauour of <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington, Windebank,</hi> and other great men about the Court, and at last grew to such a confidence, as to move this question to some Court-Bishops, <hi>viz. Whether his Majesty would permit the residing of a Catholick Bishop of the English Nation to be nominated by his Majesty, and not to exercise his Function but as his Majesty should limit</hi>? Upon which Proposition, when those Bishops had made this <hi>Quaere</hi> to him, <hi>Whether the Pope would allow of such a Bishop of his Majesties no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating as held the Oath of Allegiance lawful, and should permit the taking of it by the Catholick Subjects,</hi> he puts it off by pleading that he had no Commission to declare therein one way or other. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he found some way to move the King for the permission of an <hi>Agent</hi> from the Pope to be addressed to the Queen for the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of her Religion; which the King, with the Advice and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of his Council, condescended to, upon condition that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty sent should be no Priest. This possibly might be the sum of that account which the Archbishop tendred to the Queen at <hi>Greenwich</hi> on the <hi>Whitsontide</hi> after <hi>Panzani's</hi> coming, which as it seems was only to make way for <hi>Con</hi> (of whom more hereafter) though for the better colour of doing somewhat else that might bring him hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he composed the Rupture between the <hi>Seculars</hi> and the <hi>Regulars</hi> above-mentioned.</p>

And yet he was not so unmindful of the Foreign Churches, as not to do them all good offices when it came in his way, especially when the Doctrine or Discipline of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was not concerned in the same. For in the year 1634. having received Letters from the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> (with whom he held a constant course of Correspondence) about the furtherance of a Collection for the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Ministers of the <hi>Palatinate</hi>; he moved the King so effectually in it, that his Majesty granted his Letters Patents for the said Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be made in all parts of the Kingdom; which Letters Patents being sealed and brought unto him for his further Direction in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of the same, he found a passage in it which gave him no

Upon the reading of which passage he observed two things: First, That the Religion of the <hi>Palatine</hi> Churches was declared to be the same with ours. And secondly, That the Doctrine and Government of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is called an <hi>Antichristian Yoke</hi>; neither of which could be approved of in the same terms in which they were presented to him. For first he was not to be told, that by the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of those Churches all the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Rigors in the point of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination and the rest depending thereupon were received as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox; that they maintain a Parity of Ministers directly contrary both to the Doctrine and Government of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and that <hi>Pareus,</hi> Profes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which as it plainly proves, that the Religion of those Churches is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the same with that of ours, so he conceived it very unsafe that his Majesty should declare under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> that both himself and all his Subjects were bound in conscience to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Religion of those Churches with their utmost power. And as unto the other point he lookt upon it as a great Controversie, not only between some Protestant Divines and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but between the Protestant Divines themselves,<note place="margin">p. 540.</note> hitherto not determined in any Council, nor positively defined by the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and therefore he conceived it as unsafe as the other, that such a doubtful controversie, as that of the <hi>Popes</hi> being <hi>Antichrist,</hi> should be determined Positively by Letters Patents under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> of which there was great difference even amongst the Learned, and not resolved on in the Schools. With these objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against that passage he acquaints his Majesty, who thereupon gave order that the said Letters Patents should be cancelled, and new ones to be drawn, in which that clause should be corrected or expunged; and that being done, the said Letters Patents to be new sealed, and the said Collection to proceed according to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops first desires and proposition made in that behalf.</p>
                  <p>But before this Collection was finished, and the money returned,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:54785:156"/>
                     <hi>Charles Lodowick,</hi> Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> eldest surviving Son of the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> comes into <hi>England</hi> to bestow a visit on his Uncle, and to desire his aid and counsel for the recovery of the Electoral Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Estate which did of right belong unto him. On the twenty second of <hi>November</hi> this present year 1635. he comes to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> graciously welcomed by the King, who assigned him for his quarters in the Court, the Lodgings properly belonging to the Prince his Son, where he continued whilst he made his abode in <hi>England,</hi> except such times as he attended his Majesty in his Summers Progress. Knowing how forward the Archbishop had expressed himself in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ready Services for the Queen his Mother, and the good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he had done for her sake to the distressed Ministers of his Dominions, on the 30 day of the same Month he crost over to <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> and was present with the Archbishop at the Evening Prayer then very solemnly performed; and upon that day fortnight came unexpectedly upon him, and did him the honour to dine with him. And that he might the better endear himself to the English Nation by shewing his conformity and approbation of the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> here by Law established, he did not only diligently frequent the Morning and Evening Service in his Majesties Closet, but upon <hi>Christmass</hi> day received the Communion also in the <hi>Chappel Royal</hi> of <hi>Whitehall.</hi> For whose accommodation, at the receiving of it, there was a Stool placed within the <hi>Traverse,</hi> on the left hand of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, on which he sate while the Remainder of the Anthem was sung, and at the Reading of the Epistle, with a lower Stool and a Velvet Cushion to kneel upon both in the preparatory Prayers, and the Act of Receiving, which he most reverently performed to the great content of all beholders. During his being in the Court he published two Books in Print by the advice of the King and Council, not only to declare his Wrongs, but assert his Rights. The first he called by the name of a <hi>PROTESTATION,</hi> against all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and violent proceedings and actions against him and his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Family. The second, called the <hi>MANIFEST,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the right of his Succession in the Lands, Dignities, and Honours, of which his Father had been unjustly dispossessed by the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second. After which Preparatory writings, which served to no other effect than to justifie his own and the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the eye of the world, he was put upon a course for being furnished both with men and money to try his fortune in the Wars, in which he wanted not the best assistance which the Archbishop could afford him by his Power and Counsels. But as he laboured to advance his interess in the recovery of his Patrimony and Estates in <hi>Germany,</hi> so he no less laboured to preserve the Interess of the Church of <hi>England</hi> against all dangers and disturbances which might come from thence. And therefore when some busie heads, at the time of the Princes being here, had published the Book enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>A Declaration of the Faith and Ceremonies of the</hi> Palsgraves
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:54785:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Churches</hi>; A course was took to call it in, for the same cause, and on the same prudential grounds on which the Letters Patents before mentioned, had been stopt and altered. The Prince was welcome, but the Book might better have stayed at home, brought hither in <hi>Dutch,</hi> and here translated into English, Printed, and exposed to the publick view, to let the vulgar Reader see how much we wanted of the Purity and simplicity of the <hi>Palatine</hi> Churches.</p>

Wren</hi> had not long before succeeded <hi>Corbet</hi> in the See of <hi>Norwich</hi>; a man who very well understood his Work, and resolved to do it: but finding himself more deeply galled with these Reproaches, than he had deserved, he caused his Registers to be search'd, and the Acts of his Court to be examined, out of which we may take this short Account of his Proceedings; that is to say, 1. <hi>That the Clergie of that Diocess, comprehending all that are in Spiritual Dignity or Office, and all Parsons, Vicars, Curates, and School-Masters (taking in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturers withal) amount unto the number of</hi> 1500, <hi>or thereabouts.</hi> 2. <hi>That there were not above thirty of all sorts involved in any Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Censure of what kind soever, and not above sixteen Suspended.</hi> 3. <hi>That of those sixteen, eight were then Absolved, for a time of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trial to be taken of them, and two did voluntarily resign their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; so that there were but six Suspended absolutely, and persisting so.</hi> 4. <hi>That of the Residue, one was deprived, after notorious Inconformity for twelve years together, and final Obstinacy after several Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; eight Excommunicated for not appearing at the Court, and four inhibited from Preaching; of which four, one by Trade had been a</hi> Draper, <hi>another a</hi> Weaver, <hi>and a third a</hi> Tayler. 5. <hi>That for the other number between sixty and eighty, which were Suspended upon

                  <p>And yet it was not thought sufficient to justifie themselves in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, unless they Advocated for themselves, and the King under whom they acted, by strong Reasons also. And first, it was alledged in behalf of the King (who had commanded the said De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration to be published by Order from the Bishops, in all the Churches of their several and respective Diocesses) That all the Commands of the King, which are not upon the first inference and illation contrary to a clear passage in the Word of God, or to an evident Sun-beam of the Law of Nature, are precisely to be obeyed. 2. That it was not enough to find a remote and possible Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that might ensue therefrom; for every good Subject is bound in conscience to rest assured, That his Prince, environed with such a Council, will be able to discover, and as ready to prevent any ill se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel that may come of it, as himself possibly can be. And 3. That we must not by disobeying our Prince, commit a certain Sin, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting a probable but contingent Inconveniency. And then it was alledged in behalf of themselves, That the Declaration was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be published by Order from the Bishops in the Parish Churches; That there were none on whom the Bishops could im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Publishing of it in the Churches of their several Diocesses, but the Ministers only; which was a sufficient warrant for them to enjoin the Ministers to do it. And lastly, That though no Penalty was prescribed in it to such as should refuse to publish the same; yet that some Penalty was implied, or otherwise the Command had been impertinent, and to no purpose and effect whatsoever. Finally, it was alledged, in respect of those who were enjoined the publishing of it, That there was nothing contained in the said Declaration, which was either plainly contrary to the Word of God, or the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church, or the Laws of the Land, or the Practice of the Protestant or Reformed Churches in all parts of the World; That if it should appear otherwise with some scrupulous men, yet even those scrupulous men were bound to obey their Superiors, in making publication of it <note n="(a)" place="margin">

                  <p>Nor was the Clamour less which was raised against such of the Bishops as either pressed the use of his Majesties Instructions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Lecturers, and silencing the <hi>Arminian</hi> Controversies; or urged the Ministers of their several and respective Diocesses, to use no other form of Prayer before their Sermons than that which was prescribed <hi>Canon</hi> 55. It had been prudently observed, That by su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:54785:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
impertinently, that they dishonoured God and disgraced Religion. For remedy whereof, it was thought convenient by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop, and some other Prelates, to reduce all to the form of Prayers appointed in the <hi>Canon</hi> above-mentioned, according to the like form prescribed in the <hi>Injunctions</hi> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her time by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and before his time also by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; practised accordingly in the times of their several Reigns, as appears by the Sermons of Bishop <hi>Latimer,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Gardiner,</hi> Archbishop <hi>Parker,</hi> Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> Bishop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> and generally by all Divines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> till by the artifices and endeavours of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, these long Prayers of their own making had been taken up, to cry down the <hi>Liturgie.</hi> Which being in charge in the Visitation, and afterwards in the Articles of several Bishops, made as much noise amongst ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and factious People, under colour of quenching the Spirit of God, expressed in such extemporary Prayers of the Preachers conceiving, as silencing the Doctrines of <hi>Predestination,</hi> changing the afternoons Sermons into Catechisings, and regulating the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances of some of their Lecturers, under the colour of a Plot to suppress the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>In which last Calumny, as most of the Bishops had a share, so did it fall as heavy on <hi>Pierce</hi> of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> as on any other, though he did nothing in that kind, but what he was required to do by the Kings Instructions. His Crimes were, That he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Ministers in his Diocess to turn their afternoons Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons into <hi>Catechisings,</hi> and those <hi>Catechisings</hi> to be made according to the Questions and Answers in the <hi>Catechism</hi> authorised by Law, and extant in the Book of Common Prayer; which some few abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refusing to conform unto; and others (contrary to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the said Instructions) taking some Catechism-point for their Text, and making long Sermons on the same, were by him suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and so continued till they found a greater readiness in themselves to obey their <hi>Ordinary.</hi> But the Great Rock of Offences against which they stumbled, and stumbling filled all places with their Cries and Clamours, was, That he had suppressed the <hi>Lecturers</hi> in most parts of his Diocess; and some report, That he proceeded so far in it as to make his brag (not without giving great Thanks to God for his good Success) <hi>That he had not left one Lecturer in all his Diocess, of what sort soever, whether he Lectured for his Stipend, or by a voluntary combination of some Ministers amongst themselves.</hi> Which if it should be true, (as I have some reason to believe it is not) ought to be rather attributed to some exiliency of humane frailty (of which we are all guilty more or less) than to be charged amongst his Sins. But for his Actings in this kind, as also for his vigorous proceedings in the Case of <hi>Beckington,</hi> he had as good Authority as the Instructions of the King, and the Directions of his Metropolitan could invest him in. And so far <hi>Canterbury</hi> justified

him in the last particular, as to take the blame (if any thing were blame-worthy in it) upon himself, though then a Prisoner in the Tower, and under as much danger as the Power and Malice of his Enemies could lay upon him: For such was his undaunted Spirit, that when <hi>Ash</hi> a Member of the House of Commons, demanded of him in the Tower, Whether the Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Directions from him in the Case of <hi>Beckington</hi>? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered roundly, That he had; and that the Bishop had done nothing in it,<note place="margin">

If all the Bishops of that time had joined their hearts and hands together, for carrying on the work of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, as they were required, the Service might have gone more happily forwards, and the Envy would have been the less by being divided: but leaving the whole burden upon so few, and turning it over to their Chancellors and Under-Officers (if they did so much) they did not only, for as much as in them was, destroy the business, but expose such as took care of it, to the publick hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For such was their desire to ingratiate themselves amongst the People, that some of them being required to return the names of such Ministers as refused the reading of the Book, made answer, That they would not turn <hi>Informers</hi> against their Brethren, there being enough besides themselves to perform that Office. Others conceived, that they had very well performed their duty, and consulted their own peace and safety also, by waving all Proceedings against them in their own <hi>Consistories,</hi> wherein they must appear as the principal Agents, and turning them over to be censured by the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> where their Names might never come in question. The like done also in transposing the Communion Table; in which it was believed by many, that they had well complied with all expectations, if they did not hinder it, but left the Ministers to proceed therein as best pleased themselves; or otherwise, to fight it out with the Church-wardens, if occasion were.</p>
                  <p>And yet the fortune of the Church had not been so wretched, if none of that Order had pulled down more with one hand, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the rest had built up with both.

The Church-wardens of St. <hi>Mary Towres</hi> in the Borough of <hi>Ipswich,</hi> a Town of great Wealth and Trade in the Country of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> refusing to remove such Seats, and advance the Table in their rooms, were Excommunicated for their obstinacy

and contempt, by one of <hi>Brent's</hi> Surrogates for that <hi>Visitation.</hi> The Church-wardens, animated by some of the Town, who had better Purses than themselves, appeal unto the Dean of the <hi>Arches,</hi> and after exhibited a Bill in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> against the Surrogate: but without remedy from either. And on these terms the business stood, when <hi>Wren</hi> succeeded <hi>Corbet</hi> in the See of <hi>Norwich</hi>; and looking upon <hi>Ipswich</hi> as a place of great influence and example on the rest of the Diocess, took up his dwelling in the same. It was not long before he came to understand, that a great part of the opposition which was made as well against himself, as the Vicar-General, about the removing and railing in of the Holy Table, proceeded from a Letter written from the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> to the Vicar of <hi>Grantham</hi>; which though it was written some years since, and had long been dead; yet now it was revived again, and the Copies of it scattered in all parts of the Kingdom (the better to discourage or discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the Work in hand): but no where more than in the Diocess of <hi>Norwich,</hi> being next neighbour unto <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection of a diligent and active Prelate. Some of them coming to his Hand, and an Advertisement withall, That they were ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sold amongst the Booksellers in <hi>Duck-lane</hi> in written Copies, it was thought fit that an answer should be made unto it; in which the Sophistry, Mistakes, and Falshoods of that Letter, whosoever was the Writer of it, might be made apparent: Which Answer being made ready, approved, and licenced, was published about the middle of <hi>May,</hi> under the Title of <hi>A COAL from the AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAR, or, An Answer to a Letter not long since written to the Vicar of</hi> Grantham, <hi>against the placing of the Communion Table at the East-end of the Chancel,</hi> &amp;c. As it cooled the heat of some, so it infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the hearts of others, not with Zeal, but Anger; the Book oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioning much variety of Discourse on both sides, as men stood variously affected in the present Controversie: But long it will not be before we shall hear of a Reply unto it, a Rejoinder unto that Reply, and other Writings <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> by the Parties interessed.</p>
                  <p>But it had been to little purpose to settle a Conformity in Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Churches, if Students in the Universities (the constant Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries of the Church) were not trained up to a good perswasion of the Publick Counsels: Upon which ground it had been prudently Ordained in the <hi>Canons</hi> of the year 1603. not only, <hi>That the prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Form of Common Prayer should be used in all Colledges and Halls</hi>; but, <hi>That the Fellows and Scholars of the said Houses should wear the Surplice at those Prayers on the Sundays and Holydays, the better to inure them to it, when they came to any Publick Ministry in their several Churches.</hi> Many things had been done at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in some years last past, in order to the Work in hand; as beautifying their Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, furnishing them with Organs, advancing the Communion Table to the place of the Altar, adorning it with Plate and other Utensils for the Holy Sacrament, desending it with a decent Rail from
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:54785:160"/>
all prophanations, and using lowly Reverence and Adorations, both in their coming to those Chappels, and their going out: But in most Colledges, all things stood as they had done formerly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in some there were no Chappels at all, or at the best, some places used for Chappels, but never Consecrated. In <hi>Sidney</hi> Colledge the old <hi>Dormitory</hi> of the <hi>Franciscans</hi> (on the <hi>Site</hi> of which <hi>Friery</hi> the said Colledge was built) was after some years trimmed and fitted, and without any formal Consecration converted to a <hi>House of Prayer</hi>; though formerly, in the opinion of those who allowed thereof, it had been no better nor worse than a <hi>Den of Thieves.</hi> The Chappel of <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colledge, though built at the same time with the rest of the House, was both irregular in the situation, and never Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Divine and Religious uses. And what less could this beget in the minds of the Students of those Houses, than an Opinion touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the indifferency of such Consecrations, whether used, or not? and at the last a positive Determination, <hi>That the continued Series of DIVINE DVTIES in a place set apart to that purpose, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And what can follow thereupon in some tract of time, but the executing of all Divine Offices in Private Houses, the Ruine and Decay of Churches, the selling of their Materials, and alienating their Glebe and Tythes to the next fair Chapman? It is therefore thought expedient to carry on the Visitation to that University, and put such things in order there, as were found in this. But against this the University opposed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending an exemption from his Jurisdiction, by their ancient Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; and that they had no Visitor but his Majesty only. But <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> who before had over-ruled the like Plea in the Bishop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,</hi> would not give way to this of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which caused the matter on both sides to be thorowly canvased: But neither yielding to the other, and the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> stickling strongly for the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity (of which he had the Honour to be chosen Chancellor on the death of the Duke) the deciding of the Controversie is referred to his Majesty. On <hi>Tuesday Iune</hi> 21. they both appear before the King at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> where the Counsel of both sides being heard, it pleased his Majesty to give Judgment for the Metropolitan, and to submit that University to his Visitation: But before any thing was done in it, the Troubles in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Disturbances at home, kept it off so long, that a greater Visitation fell upon the Visitor, than could have hapned unto them. Howsoever, the bare reputation of it did prevail so far, that many who were slack or fearful in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belishing their Chappels and publick Places of Divine Worship, went on more confidently then before; insomuch that not only in the Chappels of some private Colleges, but in St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church it self, being the Publick Church of that University, the Table was railed in like an Altar, towards which many of the Doctors, Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and others usually bowed.</p>

But all this while, the <hi>Arabick</hi> was utterly laid aside in these parts of <hi>Europe</hi>; till, in conformity to the said Decree of the Council holden at <hi>Vienna,</hi> it came into our Archbishops mind to establish a Publick Lecture in that Language also; which having for a long time taken up his thoughts, was at last effected: The first Lecture in that Language, read publickly on the tenth of <hi>August</hi> in this present year; a Revenue of 40 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> settled upon the University for the maintenance of it; his first Professor in that Tongue being <hi>Edward Pocock,</hi> Fellow of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Colledge, one who had spent much time in the Factory of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and other places of the East, returning home well studied in all the Languages of those Countries. And that <hi>Rhetorick</hi> might thrive as well under his
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:54785:162"/>
Encouragements, as Grammar and the Tongues were in a hopeful way to do, he obtained from his Majesty another <hi>Canonry</hi> in <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> to be annexed for ever to the Orators place, (whose yearly Pension till that time was but twenty Nobles.) Injoyed first by Dr. <hi>William Strode,</hi> admitted thereunto on the first of <hi>Iuly, Anno</hi> 1638. and after his decease by Dr. <hi>Henry Hammond, Anno</hi> 1644.</p>
                  <p>Such were the benefits which the University received from him in this present year. And that he might both do himself and the University some honour in the eye of the Kingdom, he invites the King, the Queen, the Prince <hi>Elector,</hi> and his Brother, to an Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical entertainment, on the twenty ninth day of <hi>August</hi> then next following, being the Anniversary day, on which the President<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Colledge was adjudged to him by King <hi>Iames.</hi> The time being come, and the University put into a posture for that Royal visit, their Majesties were first received with an eloquent Speech as he passed by the house, being directly in his way betwixt <hi>Woodstock</hi> and <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> not without great honour to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the Lord Archbishop, the Lord Treasurer, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, the Vice-Chancellor, and one of the Proctors should be at that time of the same foundation. At <hi>Christ-Church</hi> his Majesty was entertained with another Oration by <hi>Strode,</hi> the University Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour; the University presenting his Majesty with a fair and costly pair of Gloves (as their custome was) the <hi>Queen</hi> with a fair Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Bible, the Prince <hi>Elector</hi> with <hi>Hookers</hi> Books of <hi>Ecclesiastical Politie,</hi> his Brother <hi>Rupert</hi> with <hi>Caesars</hi> Commentaries in <hi>English,</hi> illustrated by the learned Explanations and Discourses of Sir <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Edmonds.</hi> His Majesty was lodged in <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> in the great Hall whereof (one of the goodliest in the World) he was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, together with the Queen, the two Princes, and the rest of the Court, with an English <hi>Comedy,</hi> (but such as had more of the Philosopher than the Poet in it) called, <hi>Passions Calmed,</hi> or <hi>the settling of the Floating Islands.</hi> On the morrow morning, being <hi>Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> he began with a Sermon, preacht before him in that Cathedral on these words of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> viz. <hi>Blessed is the King that cometh in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven, and glory in the highest,</hi> Luk. 19.38. The Sermon being ended, the Archbishop, as Chancellor of the University, calls a Convocation, in which he admits the Prince <hi>Elector,</hi> his Brother Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and many of the chief Nobility to the degree of <hi>Masters</hi> of <hi>Art</hi>; and that being done, attends the King and Queen to St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Colledge. Where in the new Gallery of his own building, he entertains the King and Queen, the two Princes, with all the Lords and Ladies of the Court, at a stately and magnificent Dinner, the King and Queen sitting at one Table at the South end of the Room; the two Princes, with the Lords and Ladies, at a long Table, reaching almost from one end to the other; at which all the Gallantry and beauties of the Kingdom seemed to meet. Nor did he make Provision only for those two Tables, but
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:54785:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
every Office in the Court had their several diets, disposed of in conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient places for their reception with great variety of <hi>Achates,</hi> not only sufficient for contentment, but for admiration. After dinner he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his principal Guests with a pleasant Comedy, presented in the publick Hall; and that being done, attends them back again to <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> where they were feasted after Supper with another Comedy, called, <hi>The Royal Slave</hi>; the Enterludes represented with as much variety of Scenes and motions as the great wit of <hi>Inigo Iones</hi> (Surveyor General of his Majesties Works, and excellently well skilled in setting out a Court-<hi>Masque</hi> to the best advantage) could extend unto. It was the day of St. <hi>Felix</hi> (as himself obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth) <hi>and all things went happily.</hi> On <hi>Wednesday</hi> the next morning the Court removed, his Majesty going that same night to <hi>Winchester,</hi> and the Archbishop the same day, entertaining all the Heads of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses at a solemn Feast; order being given at his departure, that the three Comedies should be acted again, for the content and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the University in the same manner as before, but only with the Alteration of the Prologues and Epilogues.</p>
                  <p>But to return unto the publick. On the same day in which the new Statutes were received at <hi>Oxon.</hi> he procured a Supplement to be added to the old Statutes of Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, touching the letting of their Lands. Some Informations had been given, that the <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Prebends</hi> of those Churches had enricht them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, their Wives and Children by taking great Fines, for turning leases of twenty one years into leases for lives, leaving their Successors destitute of that growing means, which otherwise might come in to help them. This was the outside of the business, but the chief motive to it was, that the Gentry and Yeomanry (and some of the Nobility also) holding Lands of those Churches, might have a greater respect to the Church and Church-men, when they must depend upon them from time to time for renewing of their said Estates at the end of every ten or twelve years at the most. For though it be a like lawful by the Law of the Land, 13 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 20. to make Leases of three lives, or one and twenty years, at the pleasure of the Dean and Chapter; yet the difference is so great between them, that once a Tenant to my knowledge, after a Lease for three lives had continued 29 years in being, chose rather to give a Fine for the change of one life than to take a new Lease of 21 years without paying any thing. All which his Majesty taking into his Princely consideration,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bibl. Regia,</hi> p. 268.</note> he caused Letters under his Royal Signature to be sent to all the Deans and Chapters of this Kingdom respectively,
<q>Calling and commanding them upon pain of his utmost displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that they presumed not to let any Lease belonging to their Church into lives, which was not in lives already; and further that when any fair opportunity was offered (if any such be) they fail not to reduce such as are in lives, into years; requiring further that those his Majesties said Letters should be exemplified in the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:54785:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Register-books of the said Churches, and pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>erved in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stries of the Bishops of their several Diocess, to the end that the said Bishop might take notice of their doing therein, and give his Majesty and his Successors notice thereof, if any presumed to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey.</q>
And in regard that some of the Deans of the said Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals were a Corporation of themselves, and held their Lands di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the rest of their Chapters; a clause was added to those Letters to preserve those Lands for the benefit of their Successors, as formerly in his Majesties Instructions for ordering and disposing the Lands of Bishops on the like occasions. His Majesty therefore first declares,
<q>That he had taken order by his late <hi>Instructions,</hi> that no Bishop should let any Lease after they had been named to a better Bishoprick, but had not therein named the <hi>Deans,</hi> as he therein intended. And therefore secondly, that no Dean should presume from thenceforth, after his being named to a Bishoprick, or a better Deanry, to renew any Lease either into lives or years: His Majesty having well observed, that at such times of remove many men care not what or how they let their Estates, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Church and their Successors. Which Letters bear date at <hi>Greenwich</hi> in the twelfth year of his Reign, <hi>Iune</hi> 27.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor was he less careful to preserve the Parochial Clergy from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppressed by their neighbours in rates and taxes than he had been in maintaining the Estates of Capitular bodies, for the greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of those bodies at the present time, and the benefit of Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the time to come. During the Remiss Government of King <hi>Iames,</hi> his Majesties late embroylments with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and his entanglements at home, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had invaded the Regality of the Narrow Seas, and questioned the property of his Dominion in the same; not only growing to such an height of insolency, as to dispute their striking Sail in passing by any of his Majesties Ships: but publishing a Discourse in Latine, called, <hi>Mare Liberum,</hi> in defence thereof. These affronts occasioned <hi>Noy,</hi> the Atturney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, to put his Majesty in mind of setting out a strong power of Ships for the recovery of his Rights against all pretenders. And the better to enable him for it, adviseth him to set on foot the <hi>old Naval Aide,</hi> required of the Subject by his Predecessors. He was a man extremely well versed in old <hi>Records,</hi> with which consulting fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the course of his studies, he had excerpted and laid by many notes and precedents for the Kings levying of such Navil Aide upon the Subjects, by his own Authority, whensoever the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and safety of the Kingdom did require it of them, which Notes and Precedents he had taken as they came in his way, in small pieces of Paper (most of them no bigger than ones hand) he kept in the Coffin of a Pye, which had been sent him by his Mother, and kept there till the mouldiness and corruptibleness of it had perished many of his Papers. And by these Notes it did appear, that many times in the same years, wherein the Kings had received Subsidies
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:54785:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by way of Parliament, they levied this <hi>Naval Aide</hi> by their own sole power. For if (as he discoursed it to me at his house near <hi>Brentford</hi>) the King wanted money, either to support his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, or for the enlarging of his Dominions in Foreign Conquests, or otherwise to advance his honour in the eye of the World, good reason he should be beholden for it to the love of his People. But if the Kingdom was in danger, and that the safety of the Subject was concerned in the business, he might, and did raise such sums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as he thought expedient for the preventing of the danger, and providing for the publick safety of him and his Subjects. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which precedents he prepares a Writ, by which his Majesty commandeth the Maritime Counties to provide a certain number of Ships for defence of the Kingdom, prescribing to each Ship its seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral burden, the number of Mariners, and great Pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, with Victuals, Arms, and Ammunition thereunto propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. The Subject not daring at the first to dispute the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, collected money for the Service according to the several rates imposed on them in their several Counties; but dealt so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully with the Clergy in the levying of it, that they laid upon them generally the fifth or sixth part of the sum imposed. The Ice thus broken, and his Majesty finding that provision not sufficient to effect his purpose, issued out his Writs in the next year after <hi>anno</hi> 1635. into all the Counties of the Kingdom for preparing of a Royal Fleet to be in readiness against the beginning of this year, in which the Clergy were as like to suffer as before they did. By the best was, that they had not only a gracious Patron, but a very powerful Mediatour, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whose humble desire his Majesty was pleased to direct his Letters to all the Sheriffs in <hi>England</hi> respectively, requiring them that no Tax should be laid upon any Clergy-man, possest of a Parsonage, above the tenth part of the Land-rate of their several Parishes; and that consideration should be had of the poor Vicars in their several Parishes, according to their small revenue, compared with the Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Parishioners amongst whom they lived. The whole Sum levied by this Tax amounted to 236000 <hi>li.</hi> or there abouts, which comes not to 20000 <hi>li.</hi> a month; and being instead of all other payments, seemed to be no such heavy burthen as it was generally made by the Popular Party, many of which quarrelled and and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it.</p>
                  <p>But his Majesty was two just a Prince to exact any thing by power, when he had neither Law nor Reason to make it good. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he had the opinion of all his Judges subscribed by their hands for justifying the Legality of this Naval Tax amongst the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; so he thought fit to publish some defence of his Dominion, Right, and Soveraignty in the Narrow Seas for the satisfaction of his Neighbours. <hi>Iohn Selden</hi> of the Inner Temple, a name that stands in need of no <hi>titles of honour,</hi> had written a Discourse in the time of King <hi>Iames,</hi> which (in answer to that of <hi>Grotius,</hi> called, <hi>Mare Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berum</hi>)

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ecteth. By his perswasion he not only perfected, but publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed that laborious piece, which he dedicated to his Majesty, whose cause he pleaded. By whom it was so well approved, that he sent it by Sir <hi>William Beecher</hi> (one of the Clerks of his Council) to the Barons of the Exchequer in open Court, by them to be laid up as a most inestimable Jewel amongst the choice Records, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Crowns. In this book, which came out this year, he first asserts the Soveraignty or Dominion of the Brittish Seas to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> And that being cleared, he proved by constant and continual practice, that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> used to levy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from the Subjects (without help of Parliament) for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of Ships and other necessaries to maintain the Soveraignty which did of right belong unto them. This he brought down unto the times of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and might have brought it nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to his own times had he been so pleased, and thereby paved a plain way to the payment of <hi>Ship-money,</hi> as they commonly called it. But then he must have crost the proceedings of the House of Commons in the last Parliament, (wherein he was so great a stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler) voting down under a kind of <hi>Anathema</hi> the Kings pretensions of right to all help from the Subject, either in <hi>Tunnage</hi> or <hi>Poundage,</hi> or any other way whatsoever, the Parliament not cooperating and contributing towards it. Howsoever the Service was as grateful as the Author acceptable, from henceforth both a frequent and a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guest at <hi>Lambeth</hi> house, where he was grown into such esteem with the Archbishop, that he might have chose his own preferment in the Court (as it was then generally believed) had he not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued all other employments in respect of his Studies. But possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly there might be some other reason for his declining such imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as the Court might offer. He had not yet forgotten the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts which were put upon him about his History of Tythes, (for in the notion of affronts he beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld them alwaies) and therefore did but make fair weather for the time, till he could have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to revenge himself on the Church and Church-men, the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing took into the reckoning. For no sooner did the Bishop begin to sink in power and credit under the first pressures of the late Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but he published a book in Greek and Latine by the name <hi>Fut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>chius,</hi> with some Notes upon it. In which he made it his chief business to prove, that Bishops did no otherwise differ from the rest
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:54785:164"/>
of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> than doth a Master of a Colledge from the rest of the Fellows, by consequents, that they differed only in <hi>degree,</hi> not <hi>order.</hi> And afterwards, when his Majesty began to decline in the love of the Parliament, and that the heats grew strong between them, he was affirmed to have written the Answer to his Majesties Declaration about the <hi>Commission</hi> of <hi>Array</hi>: Which in effect proved a plain putting of the Sword into the hands of the People. So hard it is for any one to discerne the hearts of men by their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions, but the God that made them.</p>
                  <p>Thus leaving <hi>England</hi> for a time we must go for <hi>Scotland,</hi> in which we find the Canons finished, and the Bishops busie and intent on a publick <hi>Liturgie.</hi> It was his Majesties first intent to introduce the <hi>English Liturgie</hi> amongst them; and to that end, had ordered that it should be daily read in his Chappel Royal of that Kingdom, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was said. But <hi>Ballentine,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Dumblaine,</hi> and Dean of the Chappel (to whom the care thereof had been recommended) was so negligent in it, that the Archbishop found it necessary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him to some other Bishoprick on the next avoydance. The See of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> proving vacant, he procured his translation thither, and preferred <hi>Wederbourne,</hi> a <hi>Scot</hi> by birth, but bread in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> beneficed in <hi>Hampshire,</hi> and made one of the <hi>Prebends</hi> of <hi>

But the <hi>Scottish</hi> Bishops having prevailed with his Majesty, as before was noted, to have a distinct <hi>Liturgie</hi> of their own, His Majesty commanded the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to give them the best assistance he could in that way and work; which notwithstanding he delayed as long as he could, in hope to bring them in the end to a better perswasion. But finding them so resolved upon it, that they could not be altered he contributes his assistance to it, humbly intreated so to do by some Letters brought unto him by <hi>Maxwell</hi> (not long before made Bishop of <hi>Ross</hi>) bearing date <hi>April</hi> 2. 1635. and subscribed by the Archbishops of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Glascow,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Murrey, Dumblaine,</hi> and <hi>Brechine.</hi> The Book being first hammered and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and from thence transmitted to the Court, his Majesty referred it to the consideration of the Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> the Lord <hi>Treasurer Iuxon</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Wren</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Norwich</hi>: But the Lord <hi>Treasurer</hi> being taken up with other imployments the burden of the work remained on the other two. They found on the perusal of it that <hi>Wederbourne</hi> had followed such instructions as he had carried with him about the making of that book (if it must be made) in keeping so much in it of the <hi>English Liturgie,</hi> and they found also certain notes which he had sent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it, to the end that as many of them as his Majesty liked, might be made use of in that book. Thus authorised and instructed

they proceed unto the making of such Alterations as were offered to them, consisting for the most part in these Particulars: First, <hi>That the</hi> Magnificat <hi>and the rest of the</hi> Hymns, <hi>together with the</hi> Epistles <hi>and</hi> Gospels, <hi>should be printed according to the last Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the time of King</hi> James; <hi>conform therein to such Directions as they had received for Printing the</hi> Psalms of David <hi>in the last Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That for the better singing of those</hi> Psalms <hi>to the</hi> Organ, <hi>a</hi> Colon <hi>should be made in the middle of every Verse, as it was in the</hi> English. Thirdly, <hi>That they could not agree to any more Emendations in the Creed of St.</hi> Athanasius, <hi>than they had noted in that Book.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>That though the Bishops there desired some time to consider further of the Holydays, yet it was never otherwise meant: but that the Office appointed for every of them, should be kept in the</hi> Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie; <hi>the Practice and Observation of them being respited for a time to their further thoughts.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>That though they admitted of all the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences which they found in the</hi> Offertory, <hi>yet they wished that some which were in the</hi> English <hi>Book, might be added also.</hi> Sixthly, <hi>That every Prayer or Action through the whole Communion, should be named in the</hi> Rubrick <hi>before it, that it might be known to the People what it is; as they should find done to their hands in the Prayer of Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Memorial of Oblation next after following.</hi> Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That the</hi> Invitation, Confession, Absolution, Sentences, Prefaces, <hi>and</hi> Doxologie, <hi>should be retained in the same place and order which they had in the</hi> Liturgie <hi>of</hi> England; <hi>and that the Prayer of humble Access to the Holy Table, would stand very well (as they conceived) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the very Act af</hi> Participation. Eighthly, and finally, <hi>That in the Margin of the Prayer of Consecration, they should add some Note, directing him that Celebrates, at what words he should take the</hi> Patin <hi>with the Bread on it, and the</hi> Chalice <hi>with the Wine in it, into his hands, according to the Practise of the Church of</hi> England.</p>
                  <p>These Alterations being not only made by his Majesties Warrant, and approved by him in a Memorial under his Hand, bearing date the nineteenth day of <hi>April</hi> in this present year; but confirmed also with the like Royal Signature as they stood in the Book: Of which Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and some others, the Bishop gives an account to <hi>Weder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne</hi> by his Letters of the twentieth of <hi>April,</hi> being the morrow after his Majesty had Signed the said Memorial. It seems that <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbourne</hi> had given our Archbishop notice of some defects which he had found in the Book of Consecration of Archbishops, Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it was then used amongst the <hi>Scots,</hi> viz. 1. <hi>That the Order of</hi> Deacons <hi>was made but a</hi> Lay-Office <hi>at the best, as by that Book might be understood.</hi> And 2. <hi>That in the Admission to the</hi> Priesthood, <hi>the very essential Words of conferring Orders were left out.</hi> With which the King being made acquainted, he gave command to the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop to make known unto them, That he would have them either to admit the <hi>English</hi> Book, or else to rectifie their own in those two great oversights. After which, taking the whole business of that
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:54785:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Church into his consideration, it pleased him to direct his <hi>Further Instructions</hi> to the Archbishops and Bishops of it, bearing date on the eighteenth of <hi>October</hi> following; In which he requires them to take care,
<q>That the Proclamation to be made for Authorising the <hi>Service-Book,</hi> should not derogate in any thing from his Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative. 2. That in their <hi>Kalendar</hi> they should keep such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Saints as were in the <hi>English,</hi> such of the Saints as were most peculiar to that Kingdom (especially those which were of the Royal Blood, and some of the most holy Bishops) being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them: but that in no case St. <hi>George</hi> and St. <hi>Patrick</hi> be omitted. 3. That in their Book of <hi>Ordination,</hi> in giving <hi>Orders</hi> to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> they should keep the words of the <hi>English</hi> Book with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out change, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost, &amp;c.</hi> 4. That they should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert among the <hi>Lessons</hi> ordinarily to be read in the <hi>Service,</hi> out of the Book of <hi>Wisdom</hi> the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth Chapters; and out of the Book of <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> the first, second fifth, eighth, thirty fifth, and forty ninth Chapters. 5. That every Bishop within his Family twice a day cause the <hi>Service</hi> to be read; and that all Archbishops and Bishops make all Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities and Colledges within their Diocesies, to use daily twice a day the <hi>Service.</hi> 6. That the Preface to the Book of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> Signed by his Majesties Hand, and the Proclamation for Authorising the same, should be Printed, and inserted in the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer.</hi>

                  <p>Such was the form of Passing and Confirming the <hi>Scottish Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> never presented to that <hi>Kirk,</hi> nor tendred to the Approbation of any <hi>General Assembly</hi>; as in the Restitution of Episcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Introduction of the five Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> had been done before. And this is that at which the <hi>Scottish</hi> Presbyters did seem to be most offended; sufficiently displeased with any <hi>Liturgie</hi> at all, but more in having such an one as either was so near the <hi>English,</hi> or so different from it. Which fault, if any fault it were, is rather to to be charged upon the <hi>Scottish</hi> than the <hi>English</hi> Prelates. For when the way of introducing it was in agitation,<note place="margin">

<q>To look carefully to it, and to be sure to do nothing in it but what should be agreeable to the Laws of the Kingdom; and not to fail of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Advice of the Lords of the Council, and governing themselves according to it.</q>
But as it seems, those Bishops durst not trust their Clergy, or venture the reception or refusal of it to the Vote of a <hi>General Assembly,</hi> from which they could not promise themselves any good success. So that the Case seems to be much like that of <hi>King Edward</hi> vi. when the first <hi>Liturgie</hi> was Composed by some few of the Bishops, and other Learned men (not above thirteen in number) especially thereto Authorised: Or unto that of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when the second <hi>Liturgie</hi> of that King was fitted and corrected by her appointment. Neither of which durst trust their Clergy, but acted Sovereignly therein of their own Authority, not venturing either of the said Books to their Convocations: but only giving them the strength of an Act of Parliament; and then the Point in issue will be briefly this, <hi>viz. Whether the King, consulting with a lesser part of the Bishops and Clergie, and having their consent therein, may conclude any thing in the way of a</hi> Reformation, <hi>the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and greatest part not advised withal, nor yielding their consent in a formal way</hi>? Now for my Answer, that it may be built upon the surer grounds, it is to be considered, 1. Whether the <hi>Reformation</hi> be in corruption of Manners, or abuses in Government? Whether
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:54785:166"/>
in matters <hi>Practical,</hi> or in points of <hi>Doctrine</hi>? 2. It in matters <hi>Practical,</hi> Whether such Practice have the Character of <hi>Antiquity, Vniversality,</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi> imprinted on it? or that it be the Practice of particular Churches, and of some <hi>Times</hi> only? And 3. It in Points of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> Whether such Points have been determined o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> before in a <hi>General Council,</hi> or in <hi>Particular Councils</hi> universally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and countenanced? or are to be defined <hi>de novo</hi> on emergent Controversies?</p>
                  <p>And these Distinctions being thus laid, I shall Answer briefly. 1. If the things to be reformed be either Corruptions in Manners, or neglect of Publick Duties to Almighty God,; Abuses either in Government, or the Parties governing; the King may do it of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, by his sole Authority: The Clergy are beholden to him, if he takes any of them along with him when he goes about it. And if the Times should be so bad, that either the whole body of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, or any (though the greatest) part thereof, should oppose him in it, he may go forwards notwithstanding, punishing such as shall gainsay him in so good a Work, and compelling others. And this I look on as a Power annexed to the Regal Diadem, and so insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly annexed, that Kings could be no longer Kings, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it were denied them. And on the other side, if the Reformation be in Points o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Doctrine, and in such Points of Doctrine as have not been before defined, or not defined in form and manner as before laid down, the King only, with a few of his Bishops and Learned Clergy (though never so well studied in the Point disputed) can do nothing in it. That belongs only to the whole body of the Clergy in their <hi>Convocation</hi> rightly called and constituted; whose Acts being Ratified by the King, bind not alone the rest of the Clergy, in whose name they Voted: but all the residue of the Subjects of what sort soever, who are to acquiesce in their Resolutions. But if the thing to be <hi>Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> be a matter <hi>practical,</hi> we are to look into the usage of the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Times</hi>: And if the <hi>Practice</hi> prove to have been both ancient, and universally received over all the Church, though intermitted for a <hi>Time,</hi> and by <hi>Time</hi> corrupted, the King, consulting with so many of his Bishops, and others of his most able Clergy, as he thinks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>it to call unto him, and having their Consent and Direction in it, may in the case of <hi>intermission</hi> revive such <hi>Practice,</hi> and in the case of <hi>corruption</hi> and <hi>degeneration,</hi> restore it to its Primitive and Original Lustre. Now that there should be <hi>Liturgies</hi> for the use of the Church, And that those <hi>Liturgies</hi> should be Celebrated in a Language understood by the People, That in those <hi>Liturgies</hi> there should be some prescribed Forms, for Giving the Communion in both Kinds, for Baptizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, for the reverent Celebration of Marriage, performing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:54785:167"/>
with his Bishops and other Church-men (though not in a <hi>Synodical</hi> way) may cause the same to be <hi>revised</hi> and <hi>revived</hi>; and having fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to Edification and encrease of Piety, either commend them to the Church by his sole Authority, or else impose them on the People under certain Penalties, by his Power in Parliament. <note n="(a)" place="margin">

                  <p>The prosecution of this <hi>Liturgie</hi> on the one side, and the exaction of those Publick Orders on the other, kindled such fires in the breasts of some of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, that presently they brake out into open Flames.

                     </gap>s Libel in the year 1634. wherein the King was not only charged with altering the Government of that Kingdom, but traduced for very strong inclinations to the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The chief Abettor whereof (for the Author was not to be found) was the Lord <hi>Balmerino</hi>; for which he was Legally convicted, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Treason: but pardoned by the Kings great Goodness, and by that Pardon kept alive for the mischiefs following. And as the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> had <hi>Scotized</hi> in all their Practises (by railing, threatning, and stirring up of Sedition) for bringing in the <hi>Genevian</hi> Discipline in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Time; so they resolve to follow their Example now. <hi>Bastwick</hi> a Doctor of <hi>Physick</hi> (the second part of <hi>Leighton</hi>) first leads the Dance, beginning with a Pestilent Pamphlet called <hi>Flagel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Episcoporum Latialium,</hi> maliciously venomous against the Bishops, their Function, Actions, and Proceedings. But this not being likely to do much hurt amongst the People, because writ in <hi>Latine,</hi> he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds it with another, which he called his <hi>Litany,</hi> in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue: A Piece so silly and contemptible, that nothing but the Sin and Malice which appeared in every line thereof, could possibly have preserved it from being ridiculous. <hi>Prynne</hi> follows next, and publisheth two Books at once (or one immediately on the other) one of these called <hi>The Quench-Coal,</hi> in answer unto that called <hi>A Coal from the Altar,</hi> against placing the Communion-Table <hi>Altar-wise</hi>: The other named <hi>The Vnbishoping of</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus, against the Apostolical Institution of <hi>Diocesan Bishops.</hi> But that which was entituled to him by the name of a <hi>Libel,</hi> was, <hi>The News from</hi> Ipswich; intended chiefly against <hi>Wren</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> who had taken up his dwelling in that Town, as before is said: but falling as scandalously foul on the Archbishop himself, and some of the other Bishops also, and such as acted under them in the present Service. For there he descants very trimly (as he conceived) on the Archbishop himself, with his <hi>Arch-Piety, Arch-Charity, Arch-Agent for the Devil; that</hi> Beelzebub <hi>himself had been Archbishop, and the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:54785:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>
like to those, a most triumphant Arch indeed to adorn his victories.</hi> With like reproach he falls on the Bishops generally, calling them <hi>Luciferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Lord Bishops, execrable Traitors, devouring Wolves,</hi> with many other odious names not fit to be used by a <hi>Christian</hi>; and more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on <hi>Wren,</hi> telling us, <hi>That in all Queen</hi> Maries <hi>times no such havock was made in so short a time of the faithful Ministers of God in any part, nay, in the whole Land, than had been made in his Diocess.</hi> And then he adds with equal Charity and Truth, <hi>That</hi> Corbet, <hi>Chancellor to this Bishop, had threatned one or two godly Ministers with pistolling, and hanging,</hi> and I know not what, <hi>because they had refused to read his Majesties Declaration about lawful Sports.</hi> More of this dish I could have carved, but that this may serve sufficiently for a taste of the whole.</p>
                  <p>But the great Master-piece of mischief, was set out by <hi>Burton</hi> (so often mentioned before) who preaching on the fifth of <hi>November,</hi> in his own Parish Church of St. <hi>Matthews</hi> in <hi>Friday</hi> Street, took for his Text those words in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> viz. <hi>My Son, fear th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change, Chap.</hi> 24.22. In this <hi>Sermon</hi> (if I may wrong the Word so far as to give it to so lewd a Libel) he railes most bitterly against the Bishops, accuseth them of <hi>Innovating</hi> both in Doctrine and Worship, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peacheth them of exercising a Jurisdiction contrary to the Laws of the Land, 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 2. and for falsifying the Records of the Church by adding the first clause to the twentieth Article; arraigneth them for oppressing the Kings Liege people, contrary unto Law and Justice, exciting the people to rise up against them; magnifying those disobedient Spirits, who hitherto have stood out in defiance of them; and seems content in case the Bishops lives might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in question, to run the hazard of his own. For this being taken and imprisoned by a warrant from the <hi>High Commission,</hi> he makes his appeal unto the King, justifies it by an Apology, and seconds that by an Address to the Nobility: In which last he requires all sorts of people, Noblemen, Judges, Courtiers, and those of the inferiour sort, to stand up stoutly for the Gospel against the Bishops. And finally Prints all together with an Epistle Dedicatory to the King himself; to the end that if his Majesty should vouchsafe the reading of it, he might be brought into an ill opinion of the Bishops and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the Church.<note place="margin">p. 74.</note> Whose actions tend only (as he telleth us) to corrupt the Kings good peoples hearts, by casting into them fears and jealousies, and sinister opinions toward the King; as if he were the prime cause of all those <hi>Grievances,</hi> which in his name they oppress the Kings good Subjects withall. Thus also in another place, These Factors of <hi>Antichrist</hi> (saith he) practice to divide Kings from their Subjects,<note place="margin">p. 75.</note> and Subjects from their Kings, that so between both they may fairly erect Antichrists Throne again. For that indeed, that is to say, the new building of <hi>Bable,</hi> the setting up again of the throne of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> the bringing in of Popery to subvert the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:54785:168"/>
is made to be the chief design of the Prelates and Prelatical party; to which all innovations, usurpations, and more dangerous practices, which are unjustly charged upon them, served only as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives and subservient helps.</p>
                  <p>Such being the matter in the <hi>Libell,</hi> let us next look upon the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and dressings thereof, consisting most especially in those infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Attributes, which he ascribes unto the Bishops.
<q>For <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> he calls them <hi>Step-fathers</hi>; for <hi>Pillars, Caterpillars</hi>; their houses haunted, and their Episcopal Chairs poysoned, by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that bears rule in the air. They are (saith he) the Limbs of the Beast, even of Antichrist, taking his very courses to bear and beat down the hearing of the Word of God, whereby men might be saved, <hi>p.</hi> 12. Their fear is more toward an <hi>Altar</hi> of their own invention, towards an Image or Crucifix, toward the sound and syllables of <hi>Iesus,</hi> then toward the Lord <hi>Christ, p.</hi> 15. He gives then the reproachful Titles of <hi>Miscreants, p.</hi> 28. The trains and wiles of the Dragons doglike flattering taile, <hi>p.</hi> 30.

Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors for <hi>Antichrist, p.</hi> 75. <hi>Antichristian</hi> Mushrumps. And that it might be known what they chiefly aimed at, we shall hear him say that they cannot be quiet, till (<hi>res novas moliendo</hi>) they set up <hi>Popery</hi> again in her full Equipage, <hi>p.</hi> 95.

Having thus lustily laid about him against all in general, he descends to some particulars of most note and eminence,

And so proceeding to the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop (for of <hi>Wren</hi> he had spoke enough before) he tells us of him,
<q>That he used to set his foot on the Kings Laws, as the Pope did on the Emperors neck, <hi>p.</hi> 54. That with his right hand he was able to sweep down the third part of the Stars in heaven, p. 121.

These are the principal flowers of Rhetorick which grew in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>H. B.</hi> sufficient questionless to shew how sweet a Champion he was like to prove of the Church and Gospel.</p>

This of the two, the subtler and more curious piece; exceedingly cried up when it first came out; the disaffection of the times, and subject matter of the Book, and the Religious estimation which was had of the Author, concurring altogether to advance the Reputation of it to the very highest, sold for four shillings at the first, when conceived unanswerable; but within one month after the coming out of the Answer (which was upon the twentieth of <hi>May</hi>) brought to less than one. The Answer published by the name of <hi>Antidotum Lincolniense,</hi> with reference to the <hi>Licencer</hi> and <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Holy Table.</hi> The publishing of the other was delayed upon this occasion: A Resolution had been taken by command of his Majesty to proceed against the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> of Libellers (as one fitly calls them) to a publick Censure, which was like to make much noise amongst the ignorant People. It was thought fit by the Prudent Council of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> upon the execution of some Priests and Jesuits, that an Apology should be published, by the name of <hi>Iustitia Britannica,</hi> to vindicate the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Justice of the State from such aspersions, as by the Tongues and Pens of malicious persons should be laid upon it. And on the like prudential grounds it was thought expedient, that an answer should be made to the book which seemed most material; and being so made, should be kept in readiness till the execution of the Sentence, to the end that the people might be satisfied, as well in the greatness of the Crimes, as the necessity and justice of the Punishment, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon one of the Principals, by whom a judgment might be made of all the rest. But the Censure being deferred from <hi>Easter</hi> until <hi>Midsummer</hi> Term, the Answer lay dormant all the while at <hi>Lambeth</hi> in the hands of the <hi>Licencer,</hi> and was then published by the name of <hi>A briefe and moderate Answer to the seditious and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous challenges of H.

And so much for the Pen Combates, managed on both sides in the present Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies.</p>
                  <p>But whilst these things were in agitation, there hapned toward the end of this year, such an Alteration in the Court, as began to make no less noise than the rest before: It had been an ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome in the Court of <hi>England</hi> to have three Sermons every week in the time of <hi>Lent.</hi> Two of them preached on <hi>Wednesdaies</hi> and <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies,</hi> the third in the open preaching place near the Council Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber on Sundaies in the Afternoon. And so it continued till King <hi>Iames</hi> came to this Crown. Who having upon <hi>Tuesday</hi> the fifth of <hi>August</hi> escapt the hands and treasons of the Earl of <hi>Gowrie,</hi> took up a pious resolution, not only of keeping the Anniversary of that day for a publick Festival in all his Dominions, but of having a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and other divine Offices every <hi>Tuesday</hi> throughout the year. This custome he began in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and brought it with him into the Court of <hi>England</hi>; and thereupon translated one of the Lent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons from <hi>Wednesday</hi> to <hi>Tuesday.</hi> This Innovation in the Court, where before there were no Sermons (out of <hi>Lent</hi>) but on <hi>Sundaies</hi> only, came in short time to have a very strong Influence upon the Country, giving example and defence to such Lectures and Sermons on the working daies, as frequently were appointed and continued in most Corporations, and many other Market Towns in all parts of the Kingdom. In which respect it was upon the point of being laid aside at the Court on the death of that King, in reference to whose particular concernments it was taken up, and therefore his Successor not obliged to the observation. But then withall it was considered, that the new King had married with a Lady of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, that he was ingaged in a War with <hi>Spain,</hi> which could not be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on without help from the Parliament, wherein the <hi>Puritan</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had appeared to be very powerful. The discontinuing of that Sermon in this conjuncture, might have been looked on in the King as the want of zeal toward the preaching of the Gospel, and a strong tendency in him to the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of the Court to Ignorance and Superstition by depriving them of such necessary means of their Instruction. Upon these grounds it stood as before it did, as well in the holy time of <hi>Lent</hi> as in other Weeks. But now <hi>Laud</hi> being Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Wren</hi> Dean of the Chappel, it was resolved to move his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, that the <hi>Lent</hi> Sermons might be preached on <hi>Wednesdaies</hi> as they had been Anciently. To which his Majesty condescending, and the Bill of Lent-Preachers being drawn accordingly, it was first mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered secretly, and afterwards made a publick clamour, that this was one of the Archbishops Artifices, a trick devised for putting down the <hi>Tuesday</hi> Sermons of which you should never hear more,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:54785:170"/>
when this <hi>Lent</hi> was over: Which Cry growing lowder and lowder, as the <hi>Lent</hi> continued, was suddenly hush'd and stilled again on the <hi>Easter Tuesday,</hi> when they saw the Preacher in the Pulpit, as at other times. So usual is it with some men to be afraid of their own sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and terrified with fears of their own devising.</p>
                  <p>This Interruption thus past over, I shall unwillingly resume my former Argument concerning <hi>Bastwick</hi> and the rest of his fellow-Criminals, who being called unto their Answer, used so many delays, that the Case could not come to Sentence before <hi>Midsomer</hi> Term. Some Answers they had drawn: but they were so Libellous and full of scandal, that no Counsellor could be found to put his hand to them, according to the course of that Court; Instead whereof, they exhibited a cross Bill against <hi>Canterbury</hi> and his Confederates, (as they called them) charging them with the greatest part of those Reproaches, which had been made the subject-matter of their former <hi>Libels</hi>; which being signed by no hands but their own, and tendred so to the Lord Keeper, was by him rejected, and themselves taken <hi>pro confessis,</hi> their obstinacy in not answering in due form of Law, being generally looked on by the Court as a self-conviction, On the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Iune</hi> they received their Sentence, which briefly was to this effect: <hi>Prynne</hi> to be fined 5000 <hi>l.</hi> to the King, to lose the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his ears in the Pillory, to be branded on both cheeks with the Letters <hi>S.

                     <hi>English Puritan</hi>) had been condemned by the Justice of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Times.</p>
                  <p>At the pronouncing of this Sentence the Archbishop made a long and elaborate Speech, in vindication of himself and the rest of the Bishops from any Design to bring in <hi>Popery,</hi> or innovating in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Forms of Worship, here by Law established.
<q>He made his Introduction to it in a brief Discourse touching the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Crime, shewing how odious a thing it was to think of defending Religion in the way of <hi>Libels</hi>; a thing not used by any of the Primitive Christians, in the greatest heats of Persecution; and then professing for his own part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he had done nothing as a Bishop, but with a sincere intention for the good Government and Honour of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the maintenance of the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Truth and Religion professed and established in it; adding withal, That nothing but his Care of reducing the Church into <hi>Order</hi> in the External Worship of God, and the settling of it on the Rules of its first <hi>Reformation,</hi> had raised this Storm against himself and the rest of the Bishops, for which alone they stood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of <hi>Innovations,</hi> by those which were the greatest <hi>Innovators</hi> in the Christian World. He spake next touching the <hi>Calling</hi> of Bishops, which he maintained to be <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> though not all the <hi>Adjuncts</hi> of that <hi>Calling</hi>; averring further, That from the time of the Apostles, to the days of <hi>Calvin,</hi> the Government of the Church was by Bishops only, <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> being never heard of; which Claim by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> derogateth not from the King either in Right or Power (as the <hi>Libellers</hi> made it) no more than the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> by the same <hi>Right,</hi> could be thought to do; in regard they exercised not any <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> in the Kings Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but with his Licence for so doing: Or were it otherwise, yet that the Bishops stood in <hi>England</hi> in as good a case as the present Laws could make them; and therefore they that <hi>Libelled</hi> against them, <hi>Libelled</hi> against the King and State, by the Laws whereo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> they were established; and consequently, could aim at no other end, than the stirring of Sedition amongst the People. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the design of bringing in <hi>Popery</hi> (by which Artifice they chiefly hoped to inflame the People) he first acquitted the King of it, by shewing his <hi>sincerity</hi> and constancy in his Religion, exemplified by his Carriage in <hi>Spain,</hi> where he wanted no temptations to draw him from it; and his Deportment since in <hi>England,</hi> in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e had so often declared a settled Resolution, to maintain the same: Or were it otherwise, and that the King had any mind to change Religion, he must seek for other Instruments than himself to effect that purpose; most humbly thanking God, That as yet he knew not how to serve any Man, against the Truth of Christ; so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped he should never learn: professing further, for the satisfaction of all which heard him, That he knew of no plot nor purpose of alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Religion here established; and that for his own part, he had
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:54785:171"/>
ever been far from attempting any thing which might be truly said to tend that way, in the least degree; to both which he was ready to take his <hi>Oath.</hi> Which said in general, he briefly touch'd on those <hi>Innovations</hi> which in those <hi>Libels,</hi> had been charged on him and the rest of the Bishops, in order unto that Design.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>To the first <hi>Innovation,</hi> touching the suppressing of Sermons (during the time of the late <hi>Fast</hi>) in infected places, contrary to the Orders in former times, he answered, First, That <hi>after-Ages</hi> might without <hi>offence</hi> learn to avoid any visible <hi>inconvenience</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the former: And secondly, That the suppressing of those Sermons was no <hi>Act</hi> of the Bishops, but a Command proceeding (on a full debate) from the Lords of the Council, the better to avoid the spreading of the Contagion: And thirdly, That as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons on the Fast-days had been used of late, they were so far from <hi>humbling men in the sight of God,</hi> that they were fitter for other operations, as the raising of Sedition amongst the People; of which there could not be a clearer instance, than in that of <hi>Burton.</hi> To the second, That by appointing the Weekly Fasts to be on <hi>Wednesdays,</hi> and those Fasts to be kept without any Sermons, there was a plot for suppressing all <hi>Wednesday Lectures</hi> for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: It was answered, That <hi>Wednesday</hi> was the usual day for such Publick Fasts; That it was named by the <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> no great Friend to <hi>Popery</hi>; and that those men had lived to see the Fast en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the <hi>Wednesday Lectures</hi> still continued. To the third, That the Prayer for <hi>Seasonable Weather</hi> was left out of the last Book; and that the leaving of it out, was one cause of the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks and Tempestuous Weather which followed after: He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>generally,</hi> first, That all <hi>Fast-Books</hi> are made by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the King (who alone had Power to call such <hi>Fasts</hi>); and that the Archbishops and Bishops, who had the ordering of those Books, had also Power under the King, of putting in and leaving out of those Books, whatsoever they think fit for the present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Secondly, as to this particular, That when the <hi>Fast-Book</hi> was made, the Weather was very Seasonable, and the Harvest in; and that it was not the Custom of the Church to pray for seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Weather when they had it, but when it was wanting. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That it was very boldly done, to ascribe the cause of those Tempests to the leaving out of that Prayer, which God had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>revealed</hi> unto them, and they could not otherwise know but by <hi>Revelation.</hi> To the fourth, touching a Clause omitted in the first Collect, in which Thanks had been given to God for deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from <hi>Popish Superstition</hi>; He answered, That though our Fore-fathers had been delivered from such <hi>Superstitions,</hi> yet (God be blessed) that for our parts, we were never in them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not properly be said to have been delivered. To the fifth, touching the leaving out of a passage in one of the <hi>Orders</hi> for the <hi>Fast,</hi> concerning the abuse thereof in relation to <hi>Merit,</hi>
                        <pb n="337" facs="tcp:54785:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he answered, That it was left out, because in this Age and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom there was little opinion of <hi>Merit</hi> by <hi>Fasting</hi>; insomuch that all <hi>Fasts</hi> were contemned and scorned (both at <hi>Lent,</hi> and all other set times) except such as some humerous men called for of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to promote their ends. The sixth <hi>Innovation</hi> charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, was the leaving of the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of one of the <hi>Collects</hi>: And the seventh, That out of the same <hi>Collect,</hi> the words, <hi>Father of thine Elect, and of their Seed,</hi> was expunged also: To which it was answered, That the said <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> was not in the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> confirmed by Law, neither King <hi>Edward</hi> vi. nor Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> having any Children. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That it was added to the Book at the coming in of King <hi>Iames,</hi> who brought a Princely Issue with him; and left out again in the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Charles,</hi> who at that time, and for four years after, had no Issue neither. Thirdly, That as the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Children were put into the <hi>Collect</hi> when the King had no Issue of his own; so when the King had Issue of his own, there was as much reason to leave them out. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, For the leaving out of that Clause, <hi>Father of thine Elect, &amp;c.</hi> it was done by his Predecessor; and that the leaving out of the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Issue, was done by the Command of the King. The eighth <hi>Innovation</hi> charged upon them, was bowing <hi>at</hi> the Name of <hi>IESVS,</hi> and altering to that end the words in the <hi>Epistle</hi> on the <hi>Sunday</hi> next before <hi>Easter,</hi> by changing <hi>IN the Name of Iesus,</hi> to <hi>AT the Name of Iesus.</hi> And it was answered unto this, That <hi>bowing</hi> at the Name of <hi>IESVS,</hi> was no <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> made by the Prelates of this Age, but required by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in the very first beginning of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>: And secondly, Though it be <hi>IN the Name of Iesus,</hi> in the old Editions of the <hi>Liturgie</hi>; yet it is <hi>AT the Name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> in the Translation of <hi>Geneva,</hi> Printed in the year 1567. and in the New Translation Authorised by King <hi>Iames.</hi> The ninth relates to the Alteration of two Passages in the Form of Prayer set forth by Act of Parliament, for the Fifth of <hi>November</hi>; in which Form it is thus expressed, <hi>Root out the</hi> Babylonish <hi>Sect, which say of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>Down with it, &amp;c.</hi> And in the other place, <hi>Cut off those Workers of Iniquity, whose RELIGION is REBELLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON</hi>: Which are thus altered in the Books which came out last, <hi>viz. Root out that</hi> Babylonish <hi>and</hi> Antichristian <hi>Sect (of them) which say, &amp;c.</hi> And in the other, <hi>Cut off those workers of Iniquity, who turn RELIGION into REBELLION, &amp;c.</hi> To which it was replied, That the Book of Prayer appointed for the Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> was neither made, set forth, or commanded to be read by Act of Parliament: but only made, and appointed to be read by the Kings Authority. Secondly, That being made and appointed to be read by no other Authority than the <hi>Kings,</hi> the King might alter in it what he thought convenient; and that he
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:54785:172"/>
had the Kings hand for those Alterations. (What Reasons there might be to move his Majesty to it, we may enquire into hereafter on another occasion) To the tenth, for the leaving out the Prayer for the <hi>Navy,</hi> he answered, that the King had then no Fleet at Sea, nor any known enemy to assault, as he had when that Prayer was first put in; and that howsoever, if there had been any design to bring in <hi>Popery</hi> (to which these <hi>Innovations</hi> must be made subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nt) they should rather have kept in that Prayer than have left it out.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the <hi>Communion Table</hi> there were three <hi>Innovations</hi> urged, the placing of it <hi>Altarwise,</hi> reading the second Service at it, and bowing towards or before it. For answer to the first,
<q>It was proved to have been no <hi>Innovation</hi> in regard of Practice, because it had so stood in his Majesties Chappels, and divers Cathedrals of this Kingdom since the first <hi>Reformation.</hi> Which posture if it be decent and convenient for the Service of God, either in the Kings Chappels or Cathedrals, it may be used also in other Churches: but if it served to bring in Popery it was not to be used in them. Nor was it any <hi>Innovation</hi> in regard of Law, the holy Table being appointed to be placed where the Altar stood by the Queens Injunctions, <hi>Anno</hi> 1559. and that position justified by an order of Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi> (of which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready spoken) whom the <hi>Libellers</hi> themselves were not like to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for a man that purposed the <hi>ushering in</hi> or <hi>advancing of Popery.</hi> The setting of a Raile before it, or about it, howsoever placed, was only for avoiding of Prophanation, and for that cause justifiable. As for the reading of the <hi>Second</hi> (or <hi>Communion</hi>) <hi>Service</hi> at the holy Table, it was no more than what had formerly been used in many places to his own remembrance; first altered in those Churches where the <hi>Emissaries</hi> of that Faction came to preach, and therefore the <hi>Innovation</hi> to be laid on them. Secondly, That it is not only fit and proper for that part of the Divine Service to be read at the Communion Table, but that it is required so to be by the Rules and <hi>Rubricks</hi> of the Church: It being said in the first Rubrick after the Communion, that on the Holy Daies (if there be no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion) all shall be read which is appointed at the Communion; and in the last <hi>Rubrick</hi> before the <hi>Communion,</hi> that the Minister standing at the North side of the holy Table, shall say the Lords Prayer with that which follows. And finally, as to that of <hi>bowing</hi> towards it at their first entrance in the Church, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to it, it is answered, that it was agreeable to the Practice of <hi>Moses, David, Hezekiah,</hi> recorded in the holy Scriptures, and that <hi>Venite Adoremus, O come let us worship and fall down,</hi> &amp;c. was used constantly in the beginning of the Ancient Liturgies, and preserved in the beginning of ours in <hi>England</hi>; and therefore that the people may as well refuse to come, as at their <hi>coming</hi> not to <hi>Worship</hi>: he added, that by the Statutes of the noble Order of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:54785:172"/>
St. <hi>George,</hi> called the Garter, the Knights whereof were bound to do their Reverence <hi>versus Altare,</hi> toward the <hi>Altar</hi>; that it had so continued ever since the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth; that if there were any Idolatry in it, neither Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (who drove out <hi>Popery</hi>) nor King <hi>Iames</hi> (who kept out <hi>Popery</hi>) would have suffered it to remain in Practice; and in a word, that if it were <hi>Gods Worship</hi> and not <hi>Idolatry,</hi> he ought to do it as well as they: but if it were Idolatry, and no Worship of God, they ought to do it no more than he. But the fourteenth and last charge which most concerned him and the rest of the Bishops to make answer to, was the <hi>forging</hi> of a new Article of Religion brought from <hi>Rome,</hi> (to justifie their proceedings and <hi>Innovations</hi>) and foysting it to the beginning of the twentieth Article. The Clause pretended to be added, is, <hi>That the Church hath power to decree Rites and Ceremonies, and Authority in Controversies of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>aith,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause not found (say they) in the Latine or English Articles of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, or Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ratified by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; adding, that if to forge a Will or Writing be censurable in the Star-Chamber, though it be but a wrong to a Private man: how much more should the forgery of an Article of Religion be censured there, which is a wrong to the whole Church? And unto this he answered, that the Articles made in the time o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth were not now in force, and therefore not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial whether that Clause be in or out; that in the Articles as they passed in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time this Clause was to be found in the English Edition of the year 1612. of the year 1605. of the year 1593. and in Latine in the year 1563. being one of the first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Copies after the Articles had been agreed on in the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>; that it was to be found in the same terms in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of <hi>Convocation, Anno</hi> 1562. as he proved by a Certificate under the hand of a publick Notary; and therefore finally, that no such forgery in adding that Clause unto that Article had been committed by the Prelates to serve their <hi>own turns</hi> by gaining any power to the Church: but that the said Clause had been razed out by some of those men, or some of that Faction to weaken the just power of the Church, and to serve their own.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>Innovations</hi> thus passed over and discharged, he signifies unto their Lordships,
<q>That some other Charges were remaining in matter of Doctrine; that they should presently be answered, <hi>justo volumine,</hi> to satisfie all well-minded people; and that when <hi>Burtons</hi> Book was answered, (his <hi>Book</hi> he said, but not his <hi>ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi>) none of the rest should be answered either by him or by his care; leaving that Court to find a way for stopping the mouths of such <hi>Libellers,</hi> or else for him, they should raile on as long as they listed. And thus beginning to draw toward an end, he declares himself to be in the same case with St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> bitterly railed upon by a pack of <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> and yet
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:54785:173"/>
conceiving himself bound (which he made his own Resolution also) not to answer them with the like <hi>Levities</hi> or <hi>Revilings,</hi> but to write and speak only as becomes a <hi>Priest</hi> of God; that by Gods grace the Reproaches of such men should not make him faint or start aside,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have I acted <hi>Phocion</hi>'s part in cutting short the long and well-studied Speech of this grave and Eloquent <hi>Demosthenes</hi>; which I have been the more willing to reduce to so brief an Abstract, that the Reader may perceive, without the least loss of time and labour, on what weak grounds the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction raised their <hi>outcry</hi> against <hi>Innovations,</hi> and what poor <hi>trifles</hi> many of those <hi>Innovations</hi> were, against which they clamoured and cried out. But for the Speech in its full length, as it gave great satisfaction unto all that heard it: so by his Majesties Command it was afterwards Printed, for giving the like satisfaction to all those who should please to read it. In obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto which Command he caused the said Speech to be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Published, although he was <hi>not ignorant</hi> (as he declares in his Epistle to the King) <hi>that many things while they are spoken, and pass by the ears but once, give great content, which when they come to the eyes of men, and their open scanning, may lie open to some exceptions.</hi> And so it proved in the event; for though the Speech was highly magnified as it came from his mouth: yet it had not been long pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in Print, when it was encountred with a base and <hi>Libellous</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, without the name of any <hi>Author, Place,</hi> or <hi>Printer,</hi> or any <hi>Bookseller</hi> (according to the unusual Custom) where, and of whom it might be bought. I shall not trouble my self any more about it than by a <hi>Transcript</hi> of the <hi>Title,</hi> which was this that followeth: <hi>viz. DIVINE and POLITICK OBSERVATIONS, newly translated out of the Dutch Language, wherein they were lately divulged, upon some lines in the Speech of the Archbishop of</hi> Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, <hi>pronounced in the STAR-CHAMBER the fourteenth of</hi> June, 1637. <hi>VERY expedient for preventing all prejudice which as well through ignorance, as through malice and flattery, may be incident to the judgment which men make thereby, either of his</hi> Graces <hi>power over the Church, and with the King: or of the Equity, Iustice and Wisdom of his ENDS in his said Speech; and of the reasons used by him for attaining to his said ENDS.</hi> And though he took great care and pains concerning that supposed <hi>additional</hi> clause to the 20th Article, so much as might satisfie any man, not extremely partial; yet find I a late Writer so unsatisfied in it, <hi>that he leaves it to the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:54785:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>
State-Arithmeticians to decide the Controversie, whether the Bishops were more faulty in the</hi> addition, <hi>than the opposites in their</hi> substraction <hi>of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One other Charge there was, and a great one too, which I find not touched at in this Speech; and that is, that the Prelates neither had, nor sought to have <hi>the Kings Letters Patents under the Great Seal of</hi> England <hi>for their keeping Courts and Visitations,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Burt. Serm.</hi> p. 69.</note> &amp;c. <hi>but did all in their own Names, and under their own Seals, contrary to the Law in that behalf.</hi> Concerning which we are to know, that by a Statute made in the first year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. c. 2.</note> it was Enacted,
<q>That all Summons, Citations, and other Process Ecclesiastical in all Suites and causes of Instance, and all causes of Correction, and all causes of Bastardy, or Bigamy, or <hi>De jure Patronatus,</hi> Probates of Testaments, and Commissions of Administrations of persons deceased, be made in the name, and with the Style of the King, as it is in Writs <hi>Original</hi> or <hi>Iudicial</hi> at the Common Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As also that no matter of person or persons who hath the Exercise of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, use any other Seal of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction but wherein his Majesties Arms be engraven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on pain of incurring his Majesties indignation, and suffering imprisonment at his will and pleasure.</q>
Which Statute, and every branch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, being repealed by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and not revived by Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> in all her Reign, the Bishops of her time were safe enough from any danger on that side. But in the first Parliament of King <hi>Iames</hi> there passed an <hi>Act, for continuing and reviving of divers Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and for repealing of some others,</hi> 1 <hi>Iac.</hi> c. 25. Into the Body whereof a Clause was cunningly conveyed (his Majesties <hi>Council</hi> learned, not considering, or fraudulently conniving at it) for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing of that Statute of the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> by which King <hi>Edwards</hi> stood repealed; of which no notice being taken for some while by those whom it chiefly did concern, it was now discovered, and made use of as a Rod to affright the Prelates from exercising their Jurisdiction over obstinate and incorrigible Non-conformists, as formerly they had been accustomed. For remedy whereof, and for encouraging the Bishops to perform their duties, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the Judges with an unanimous consent, and so delivered by the Lords Chief Justices in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> the fourteenth of <hi>May</hi> in this present year, That the said Act of Repeal, 1 of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> did still stand in force as unto that particular Statute by them so much pressed. This was sufficient for the present, but the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop would not trust to it for the time to come; and thereupon in in his Epistle to the King, before remembred,
<q>He humbly desired his Majesty in the Churches name, That it might be resolved by all the Reverend Judges of <hi>England,</hi> and then published by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, that the Bishops keeping of their Courts, and issuing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses in their own names, and the like exceptions formerly taken, and now renued, were not against the Laws of this Realm, that
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:54785:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so the Church Governours might go on chearfully in their duty, and the peoples minds be quieted by this assurance, that neither their Law, nor their Liberty, as Subjects, was thereby infringed.</q>

                  <p>Having carried on this business as far as we can without breaking the rule of time in too gross a manner, we must go back to the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> where we left the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> ready to put in his Answer after many delaies. In which estate the business stood, when <hi>Kilvert,</hi> a <hi>Proctor</hi> in the Arches, who had been formerly imployed in hunting <hi>Bennet,</hi> a corrupt Judge of the Prerogative Court, to his final Sentence, was entertained to prosecute this Bishop to the like confusion; who having found by diligent inquiry, and subtle pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, that the Bishops purgation depended most upon the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of one <hi>Prigeon,</hi> the Register of the Court at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> he made it his chief work, by discrediting the Witness, to invalidate and make void his evidence, he laies a Bastard to his charge, and there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red sufficient ground to indict him for it. The Bishop apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself necessitated to weight up <hi>Prigeon</hi> his repute, engaged himself more zealously therein than was consistent with the gravity of so great a Prelate for so inconsiderable a person. The Fathering of this <hi>Bastard</hi> is bandied betwixt <hi>Prigeon</hi> and one <hi>Boone</hi> from Sessions to Sessions, and from one year unto another, till the Mother of the Child was found to have been tampered with by some of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Creatures to charge it wholly upon <hi>Boone.</hi> On the discovery of which practise <hi>Kilvert</hi> lets go his former hold, and exhibits a new Bill against the Bishop for <hi>subornation</hi> of Witnesses, a crime most proper for that Court. The Bishop now finds himself at a
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:54785:175"/>
loss, and endeavours a Composition with his Majesty, being willing to lay down a good Sum of Money, for the purchasing of his own Peace and his Majesties Favour; which afterwards was urged against him, to prove him conscious of the Crime which he stood accused for. On <hi>Tuesday</hi> the eleventh of <hi>Iuly</hi> he received his Doom, which was to pay 8000 <hi>l.</hi> unto the King, to be Suspended <hi>à Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciis &amp; Officiis,</hi> and stand committed unto Prison at his Majesties Pleasure. To this Sentence the Archbishop consented amongst the rest, <hi>aggravating</hi> the fault of <hi>Subornation</hi> of <hi>Perjury,</hi> with a pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Speech of almost an hour long,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ch. Hist.</hi> lib. 11. p. 157.</note> shewing how the World was above three thousand years old, before it was ripe enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit so great a Wickedness; That <hi>Iezabel</hi> was the first in Scripture, which had been branded with that Infamy, whose Witnesses could find no other name in Scripture than the Sons of <hi>Belial</hi>: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That considering the greatness of the offence, though before he had been five times on his knees before his Majesty in the Bishops behalf, yet now he could not but agree to the heaviest Censure. To which Sentence the whole Court concurred, his best Friends amongst them, who gave themselves not a little hope, that the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of it (especially as unto the Fine) might receive mitigation; though in the end, his Majesty looking on him, both as adjudged to be guilty, and well known to be solvent, it was no wonder if the utmost penny of it were exacted.</p>
                  <p>He had not lain long under this Suspension and Imprisonment, but he began to find how dreadful a thing it was to fall into a Kings displeasure; and thereupon made use of all his Friends at Court, for the re-obtaining of his own Liberty, and his Majesties Favour: And to that end, he made means by the Queen to be admitted to a Reconciliation with him, offering both his Bishoprick, and Deanry of <hi>Westminster,</hi> in confidence that the King would so provide for him, that he should not go much less than he was. The King, upon the Queens desire, sent the Earl of <hi>Dorset</hi> (from whose mouth I had it) to accept the Bishops Offer on the one side; and on the other side, to promise him in his Majesties Name, the next good Bishoprick which should fall in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Which Proposition being made, the Bishop absolutely refused to hearken to it, telling the Earl of <hi>Dorset,</hi> That he had made a shift, by the Power and Mediation of his Friends, to hold out against his Enemies here for seven years together: but if they should send him into <hi>Ireland,</hi> he should there fall into the hands of a man, who once in seven Months would find out some old Statute or other to cut off his head. Which double dealing did so cool the Affections of his Friends in Court, that for three years and more there were no further Endeavours used for his Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: During which time, he never went unto the Chappel of the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he was Imprisoned, to attend the <hi>Divine Service</hi> of the Church, or hear the <hi>Sermon</hi> there, or receive the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as all other <hi>Protestant</hi> Prisoners had been used to do: but kept himself

only to his Private Devotions, to which his neerest Servants were not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But great Persons must not fall alone. Three of his Servants which had been most active in the business, were censured at the same time also; <hi>Walker</hi> his Secretary, fined at 300 <hi>l. Powell</hi> an Officer of his Houshold, fined no more than he: But <hi>Land,</hi> who left his Business in the Court of <hi>Lincoln</hi> to attend this Suit, at 1000 Marks. All of them censured to Imprisonment, which none suffered but he, and that but for a short time neither. Nor were their Fines exacted of them, which (as the Bishop after found to his cost) were in short time to be commuted into such other Offices as they were to do for <hi>Kilvert</hi> against their Master: The Story whereof, desireth the Readers further patience, though it come somewhat out of time, and is briefly this. <hi>Osbaldston</hi> the late Schoolmaster, and then Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend of <hi>Westminster,</hi> a profess'd Creature of the Bishops, and much imployed by him in his greatest businesses, had written a Letter to him about <hi>Christmas,</hi> in the year 1635. touching some Heats which hapned in that cold Season, betwixt the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Lord Treasurer <hi>Weston: Osbaldston</hi> conceiving this to be a fit opportunity for the Bishop to close in with <hi>Weston,</hi> and by his means to extricate himself out of those Perplexities, in which this <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> Suit had so long intangled him. This Intelligence he disguised in these expressions, <hi>viz. The little Vermin, the Vrchin and</hi> Hocus Pocus, <hi>is this stormy</hi> Christmas <hi>at true and real variance with the great</hi> Leviathan. And this conceit, the Bishop out of too much jollity makes known to others, by whom at last it came to <hi>Kilvert</hi>; who laying hold on the Advantage, exhibits a new Bill against him, for divulging Scandalous Libels against Privy Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors; there being good proof to be produced, That by the names of <hi>Little Vermin, Vrchin,</hi> and <hi>Hocus Pocus,</hi> the writer of that Letter designed no other than the Archbishop, and the Lord Treasurer <hi>Weston</hi> by the <hi>Great Leviathan.</hi> Both being made Parties to the Bill, <hi>Osbaldston</hi> answers for himself, That by <hi>Leviathan,</hi> he intended Chief Justice <hi>Richardson;</hi> and <hi>Spicer</hi> a Doctor of Laws, by the other <hi>Character</hi>: The differing statures of the men, seeming to make good this <hi>Construction,</hi> which the <hi>Grammar</hi> of the Text might bear, as well as the other. The Bishop pleaded for his part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he remembred not the receiving of any such Letter; and that if any such Letter had come unto him, it could not be brought within the compass of a <hi>Libel,</hi> because not written in such plain and significant terms as might apparently decypher and set forth the Person intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it. But all this proved to be but shifts on either side; for <hi>Kilvert</hi> had a Letter ready (which <hi>Walker</hi> was supposed to have put into his hands) to make sure work of it; a Letter which the Bishop had writ to the said <hi>Walker,</hi> being then his Secretary, at the time of that falling out betwixt <hi>Laud</hi> and <hi>Weston. Here is a strange thing</hi>
                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:54785:176"/>
(saith that Letter) <hi>Mr.</hi> Osbaldston <hi>importunes me to contribute to my Lord Treasurers use, some Charges upon the Little Great Man, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures me they are mortally out. I have utterly refused to meddle in this business; and I pray you learn from Mr.</hi> S. <hi>and Mr.</hi> H. <hi>if any such falling out be, or whether somebody hath not gulled the Schoolmaster in these three last Letters; and keep it unto your self, what I write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.

                  <p>This Secret thus discovered, and the Mystery opened, it was not long before the Cause was brought to Censure: For the two Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being compared with the Time and Circumstances, it was no hard matter to the Lords (who had their own Concerment in it) to conclude both of them to be guilty of the Crime called <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> a Libelling and defaming the Great Men of the Realm, pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which may obtain the greater cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, first, in regard that no course was taken to stop his flight, no search made after him, nor any thing done in order to his Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension. And secondly, By <hi>Osbaldstons</hi> readiness to do the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop all good Offices in the time of his Troubles, upon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which was given him (at his coming back) of such good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions: For <hi>Osbaldston</hi> not hoping for so much favour, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more the shame of the Punishment, than the loss of Preferment, had seasonably withdrawn himself to a Friend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this hapned not till the latter end of the year next following, though I have laid it here together, because of the coherence which it hath with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Story.</p>
                  <p>To look back therefore where we left; The Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> was no sooner Suspended by the <hi>High-Commission</hi> (that part of the Sentence being executed <hi>Iuly</hi> 24.) but all the Profits of his Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:54785:176"/>
in the Church, were Sequestred to the Use of the King: A Privy Seal is sent to the <hi>Sub-Dean</hi> and <hi>Prebends</hi> of the Church of <hi>Westminster,</hi> requiring them to set apart all the Profits, certain and uncertain, which of right accrued unto that <hi>Dean,</hi> and to pay the same from time to time into the Receipt of the Exchequer. And that his Majesties Profits might not suffer any diminution, nor the <hi>Prebends</hi> of that Church be punished for the fault of their <hi>Dean,</hi> a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was issued under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> inabling them to Let and Set, to Renew Leases, keep Courts, and make Grants of Offices; and finally, to act and do all manner of things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Government of that Church, in as ample manner as if the <hi>Dean</hi> himself had been present at the doing of them. The like course also taken, in gathering in the Profits of his other Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; those of the Bishoprick of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> naturally flowing into the Exchequer, as in times of Vacancy. And as for his <hi>Episcopal Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,</hi> that fell as naturally to the Archbishop of the <hi>Province,</hi> as the Temporal Revenue to the King; the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> exercising all kind of <hi>Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction</hi> throughout the Diocess of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> not only as <hi>Ordinary</hi> of that Diocess, but as <hi>Visitor</hi> of all those Colledges which had any dependence on that See. Amongst which Colledges, as that of <hi>Eaton</hi> was the chief, so there was somewhat in it which was thought to want a present Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; some Information being given, That they had diminished the number of their Fellows from Ten to Seven. This being a matter easily to be proved, they were required to make up their number, according to their first Foundation by King <hi>Henry</hi> vi. But against this, the Fellows pleaded, That out of an hatred to their Founder, a great part of their Lands had been taken from them by King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> iv. conferred by him upon the <hi>Abby</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi> and the Church of <hi>Windsor,</hi> and by them enjoyed until this day; and that they hoped his Grace would not tye them to maintain the whole number of their Fellows, with little more than half their Lands. To which so reasonable a desire, upon full proof made of the Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, his Grace did readily consent, and left them in the same state in which he found them.</p>
                  <p>The noise of these Proceedings in <hi>England,</hi> in the <hi>Iune</hi> and <hi>Iuly</hi> of this year, being quickly posted to the <hi>Scots,</hi> became a principal Incentive of those Combustions, which not long after inflamed that Kingdom; For it could be no hard matter for the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> there, to possess the People with the sense of the like smart Sufferings, by the Pride and Tyranny of their Bishops, if they permitted them to grow great and powerful, and did not cast about in time to prevent the mischief. And to exasperate them the more, the Superstitions of the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> now at the point of being put in execution, were presented to them; which if once settled amongst them, as was then intended, would in short time reduce them under the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> They could not but confess, That
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:54785:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>
many things which were found fault with in the English <hi>Liturgie,</hi> were in this altered unto the better, the name of <hi>Priest</hi> (so odious unto them of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction) changed to that of <hi>Presbyter</hi>; no fewer than sixty Chapters, or thereabouts, taken out of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha,</hi> appointed to be read by the Church in the English Book, reduced to two, and those two to be read only on the Feast of <hi>All-Saints</hi>; The new Translation, Authorised by King <hi>Iames,</hi> being used in the <hi>Psalms, Epistles, Gospels, Hymns,</hi> and <hi>Sentences</hi> instead of the old Translation so much complained of in their Books and Conferences. But what was this compared with those Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, those horrible Corruptions, and Idolatries, now ready to be thrust upon them, in which this Liturgy as much exceeded that of <hi>England,</hi> as that of <hi>England</hi> had departed from the simplicity and purity of the holier Churches? Now therefore somewhat must be done to oppose the entrance of the Popish superstitious Service-Book, either now or never: But the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers, who had gone thus far, did not alone bring fewel to feed this flame, to which some men of all degrees and qualities did contribute with them. The Lords and Gentry of the Realm, who feared nothing so much as the Commission of <hi>surrendries,</hi> above mentioned, laid hold on this occasion also; and they being seconded by some male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Spirits of that Nation, who had not found the King to be as prodigal of his bounties to them as his Father had been before, endeavoured to possess them with Fears and Jealousies, that <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was to be reduced to the Form of a Province, and governed by a Deputy, or Lord Lieutenant, as <hi>Ireland</hi> was. The like done also by some Lords of secret Counsel, who before had governed as they listed, and thought their power diminished, and their persons under some neglect, by the placing of a Lord President over them to direct in Chief. So that the People generally being fooled into this opinion, that both their Christian and Civil Liberty was in no small danger, became capable of any impression which the Presbyterian Faction could imprint upon them; nor did they want incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the Faction in <hi>England,</hi> to whom the Publication of the Book for <hi>Sports,</hi> the transposing of the holy Table, the suppressing of so many <hi>Lecturers,</hi> and Afternoon Sermons, and the inhibiting of Preaching, Writing, Printing, in defence of <hi>Calvinism,</hi> were as distasteful and offensive, as the new <hi>Liturgie</hi> with all the supposed su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions of it, was to those of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Combination made, and the ground thus laid, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if the people brake out into those distempers, which soon after followed. <hi>Sunday</hi> the 23 of <hi>Iuly</hi> was the day appointed for the first reading of the New <hi>Liturgy</hi> in all the Churches of that Kingdom; and how it sped at <hi>Edenborough</hi> (which was to be exemplary to all the rest) shall be told by another, who hath done it to my hand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
<q>
                        <hi>Iuly</hi> 23. being <hi>Sunday,</hi> the <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Edenborough</hi> began to read the Book in St. <hi>Giles</hi> his Church (the chief of that City)
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:54785:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but he had no sooner entred on it than the inferiour multitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in a tumultuous manner to fill the Church with uprore, whereupon the Bishop of <hi>Edenborough</hi> stept into the Pulpit, and hoping to appease them by minding them of the Sanctity of the place, they were the more enraged, throwing at him Cudgels, Stools, and what was in the way of Fury, unto the very endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his life. Upon this the Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> Lord Chancellor, was enforced to call down from the Gallery the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost, Bailiffs,</hi> and other Magistrates of the City to their assistance, who, with much ado, at length thrust the unruly Rabble out of the Church, and made fast the doors. This done, the Dean pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in reading the Book, the multitude in the mean while rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at the doors, pelting the Windows with stones, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring what in them lay to disturb the Sacred Exercise: but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this clamour the Service was ended, but not the peoples rage,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Hist. K.</hi> C. p. 153.</note> who waiting the Bishops retiring to his Lodging, so assaulted him, as had he not been rescued by a strong hand, he had probably perisht by their violence. Nor was S. <hi>Giles</hi> his Church thus only pestered and profaned, but in other Churches also (though not in so high a measure) the peoples disorders were agreeable. The Morning thus past, the Lord Chancellor and Council assembled to prevent the like darings in the Afternoon, which they so effected as the Liturgy was read without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance: Only the Bishop of <hi>Edenborough</hi> was in his return to his Lodging rudely treated by the people, the Earl of <hi>Roxboroughs</hi> Coach, in which he passed, serving for no protection to him; though <hi>Roxborough</hi> himself was highly favoured of the People, and not without some cause suspected to have had a hand in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of that day.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The business, having thus miscarried in <hi>Edenborough,</hi> stood at a stand in all other Churches of that Kingdom; and therefore it will not be amiss to enquire in this place into the causes and occasions of it: it seeming very strange to all knowing and discerning men, that the Child that had so long lain in the Womb, perfectly formed, and now made ready for the birth, should not have strength enough to be delivered. Amongst which causes, if disposed into ranke and order, that which appears first is the confidence which <hi>Canterbury</hi> had in the Earl of <hi>Traquaire,</hi> whom he had raised from the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a private Laird to be a Peer of that Realm, made him first <hi>Treasurer Depute</hi> (<hi>Chancellor</hi> of the Exchequer we should call him in <hi>England</hi>) afterwards Lord <hi>Treasurer</hi> and Privy Counsellor of that Kingdom. This man he wrought himself so far into <hi>Lauds</hi> good liking, when he was Bishop of <hi>London</hi> only, that he looked upon him as the fittest Minister to promote the Service of that Church, taking him into his nearest thoughts, communicating to him all his Counsels, committed to his care the conduct of the whole Affair, and giving order to the Archbishops and Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> not to
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54785:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do any thing without his privity and direction. But being an <hi>Hamiltonian Scot</hi> (either originally such, or brought over at last) he treacherously betrayed the cause, communicated his Instructions to the opposite Faction from one time to another, and conscious of the plot for the next daies tumult, withdrew himself to the Earl of <hi>Mortons</hi> house of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> to expect the issue. And possible it is, that by his advice, the executing of the Liturgy was put off from <hi>Easter</hi>; at what time the reading of it was designed by his Majesty, as appears by the Proclamation of <hi>December</hi> 20. which confirmed the Book. By which improvident delay he gave the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Faction the longer time to confederate themselves against it, and to possess the people with Fears and Jealousies, that by admitting of that book they should lose the Purity of their Religion, and be brought back unto the Superstitions and Idolatries of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And by this means the People were inflamed into that Sedition, which probably might have been prevented by a quicker prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Cause at the time appointed, there being nothing more destructive of all publick Counsels than to let them take wind amongst the People, cooled by delaies, and finally blown up (like a strong Fortress undermined) by some subtle practice. And there were some miscarriages also amongst the Prelates of the Kirk in not communicating the design with the Lords of the Council, and other great men of the Realm, whose Countenance both in Court and Country might have sped the business. <hi>Canterbury</hi> had directed the contrary in his Letters to them, when the first draughts of the Liturgy were in preparation, and seems not well pleased in another of his to the Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi>

It was complained of also by some of the Bishops, that they were made strangers to the business, who in all Reason ought to have been trusted with the knowledge of that intention, which could not otherwise than by their diligence and endeavours amongst their Clergy, be brought to a happy execution. Nor was there any care taken to adulce the Ministers, to gain them to the Cause by fair hopes and promises, and thereby to take off the edge of such Leading men as had an influence on the rest; as if the work were able to carry on it self, or have so much Divine assistance as countervailed the want of all helps from man. And which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps conduced as much to the destruction of the Service as all the rest, a publick intimation must be made in all their Churches on the <hi>Sunday</hi> before, that the <hi>Liturgie</hi> should be read on the Lords day following, of purpose, as it were, to unite all such as were not well affected to it, to disturb the same.</p>
                  <p>And there were some miscarriages also, which may be looked on as <hi>Accessories</hi> after the Fact, by which the mischief grew remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:54785:178"/>
and the malady almost incurable.
<q>For first, the Archbishops and Bishops most concerned in it, when they saw what hapned, consulted by themselves apart, and sent up to the King without calling a Council, or joyning the <hi>Lay</hi> Lords with them; whereas all had been little enough in a business of that nature, and so much opposed by such Factious persons as gathered themselves on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose together at <hi>Edenborough</hi> to disturb the Service. A particular in which the Lay Lords could not be engaged too far; if they had been treated as they ought. But having run upon this error they committed a worse in leaving <hi>Edenborough</hi> to it self, and retiring every one to his own Diocess, except those of <hi>Galloway</hi> and <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaine,</hi> For certainly they must needs think (as <hi>Canterbury</hi> writes in one of his Letters to <hi>Traquaire</hi>) that the Adverse party would make use of the present time to put further difficulties upon the work; and therefore that they should have been as careful to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, the Bishop of <hi>Ross</hi> especially, whose hand had been as much in it as the most.</q>
But possibly the Bishops might conceive the place to be unsecure, and therefore could not stay with safety, neither the Lords of the Council, nor the Magistrates of the City having taken any course to bring the chief Ringleaders of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult to the Bar of Justice: which must needs animate all disaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and seditious persons, and almost break the hearts of those who were well enclined. And such indeed was the neglect of the Civil Magistrate that we hear of no man punished, scarce so much as questioned, for so great a Riot, as was not to be expiated but by the death, or some proportionable punishment of the chief offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Which had it been inflicted on some three or four for a terror to others, it might have kept that City quiet, and the whole Kingdom in obedience for the time to come, to the saving of the lives of many thousands (some hundreds of thousands at the least in all the three Kingdoms) most miserably lost in those long and cruel Wars, which ensued upon it. But the Lords of <hi>Scotland</hi> were so far from looking before them, that they took care only for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and instead of executing Justice on the Malefactors, <hi>suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> the <hi>Liturgie</hi> it self as the cause of the Tumult, conceiving it a safer way to calm the differences than to encrease the storm by a more rigorous and strict proceeding. All that they did in order to his Majesties Service, or the Churches peace, was the calling in of a scandalous Pamphlet, entituled, <hi>A dispute against the English Popish Ceremonies obtruded on the Kirk of</hi> Scotland; which not being done till <hi>October</hi> 20 following, rather declared their willingness to suffer the said Book to be first dispersed and set abroad, then to be called in and suppressed.</p>
                  <p>Nor seemed the business to be much taken to heart in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> from whom the <hi>Scots</hi> expected to receive Directions: Nor Order given them for unsheathing the Sword of Justice, to cut off such unsound and putrified Members, which might have saved
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:54785:179"/>
the whole Body from a <hi>Gangreen</hi>: the drawing of some Blood in the Body Politick, by the punishment of Malefactors, being like let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Blood in the Body Natural, which in some strong Distempers doth preserve the whole. Or granting that the Tumult had been grown so high, and so strongly backed, that Justice could not safely have been done upon them; a way might have been found to have cooled the Fever, without loss of Blood, by bringing the whole Corporation under the danger of a forfeiture of their Lands and Liberties in a Legal way; which course proved so successful unto King <hi>IAMES</hi> on the like occasion, <hi>Anno</hi> 1597. Or finally, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that the Cause admitted not such a long delay, if then his Majesty had but sent a Squadron of the Royal Navy which he had at Sea, to block up their Haven, he had soon brought the <hi>Edenburghers</hi> unto his devotion, and consequently kept all the rest of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in a safe Obedience. This was the way to keep them under; and of this course the People of the City were more afraid, than of any other. Somewhat they are to do, which might make his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty hope better of them than they had deserved; and nothing they could do which might better please him, than to express their chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness in admitting the <hi>Liturgie.</hi> To this end they addressed their Letters to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as more concerned in this Affair than any other of the Lords which were neer his Majesty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing in the same their great dislike of the late Tumult; for their Innocency therein, they refer themselves to his Majesties Council in that Kingdom, declaring further their concurrence with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops which remained in the City, and the Ministry of the same, for settling the <hi>Service-Book</hi>; and offering Means above their Power, to such as should undertake the Reading of it; and finally, desiring his Grace to make known to his Majesty, how ready they were at all points to advance the Service, which they promised to accept as an accumulation of his Graces Favours unto them and their City. And that this Letter of theirs, which bears date the nineteenth of <hi>August,</hi> might bear the greater credit with him, they did not only seem industrious for the apprehending of some, and the inquiring after others of the Principal Actors; but bound themselves by an Obligatory Act of the Common-Council,<note place="margin">

than before to pursue that Quarrel: but the City swarmed with throngs of People from all parts, even to a formidable number, which moved the Lords to publish two Proclamations on the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>October</hi>; The first commanding all of them to repair to their Dwellings, except such as should shew sufficient reason for their stay and continuance there: The second, for Adjourning the Sessions from <hi>Edenborough,</hi> to the Town of <hi>Linlithgow.</hi> But this served rather like the powring on of Oyl, to encrease the Flame; than of Water, to quench it: For the next day the Bishop of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway</hi> being to Sit with the Lord Chief Justice upon some especial Business in the Council-House, he was pursued all along the Street with bitter Railings to the very Door; and being drawn in from the rage of the People, they immediately beset the House, demanding the delivery of him, and threatning his destruction. The Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> being advertised of the Bishops danger (who formerly had been his Tutor) came to his Relief, and with much ado forced an Entrance thorow the Press: But being got in, he was in no better plight than the Bishop, the Clamour still encreasing more and more, and encompassing the Council-House with terrible Menaces. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Provost</hi> and City-Council was called to raise the Siege: but they returned answer, That their condition was the same; for they were surrounded with the like Multitude, who had enforced them, for fear of their Lives, to sign a Paper importing, First, <hi>That they should adhere to them, in opposition to the Service-Book</hi>: Secondly, <hi>To restore to their Places</hi> Ramsey <hi>and</hi> Rollock <hi>two Silenced Ministers, and one</hi> Henderson <hi>a Silenced Reader.</hi> No better Answer being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, the Lord <hi>Treasurer,</hi> with the Earl of <hi>Wigton,</hi> went in Person to the Town-Council-House, where they found the heat of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry somewhat abated, because the Magistrates had signed the Paper; and returned with some hope that the Magistrates would calm the Disorders about the Council-House, so as the Bishop might be preserved: But they no sooner presented themselves to the Great Street, than they were most boysterously assaulted, the Throng be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so furious, as they pulled down the Lord <hi>Treasurer,</hi> took away his Hat, Cloack, and White Staff, and so haled him to the Council-House. The Lords seeing themselves in so great danger, at length pitch upon the best expedient for their safety, and sent to some of the Noblemen and Gentry, who were disaffected to the <hi>Service-Book,</hi> to come to their Aid. These Lords and Gentlemen came, as was desired, and offered both their Persons and Power to protect them; which the Lords and the Council-House readily embraced, and so were quietly guarded to <hi>Holy-Rood</hi>-House, and the Bishop to his Lodging. The Lords of the Council not thinking themselves to be secure, published a Proclamation the same day in the afternoon, for repressing such Disorders for the time to come: But they found slender Obedience yielded to it, Commissioners being sent unto them from the Citizens, in an insolent manner, for demanding the Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:54785:180"/>
of their Ministers to their Place and Function, and performing all such Matters as had been agreed on at the <hi>Pacification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These Riots and Seditions might have served sufficiently in another Reign, to have drawn a present War upon them, before they were provided in the least degree to make any resistance: But the <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghers</hi> knew well enough what they were to do, what Friends they had about the King, and what a Party they had got among the Lords of his Council, which Governed the Affairs of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: And they were apt enough to hope, by the unpunishing of the first Tumult on <hi>Iuly</hi> 23. That the King might rather have <hi>patience</hi> enough to bear such Indignities, than <hi>Resolution</hi> to revenge them; so that he came at last to that perplexity, which a good Author speaks of, <note n="(a)" place="margin">

For instead of using his just Power to correct their Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, he courts them with his Gracious Proclamation of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>December,</hi> in which he lets them know,
<q>How unwilling he was that his Loyal and Faithful Subjects should be possessed with groundless and unnecessary doubts and fears touching their Religion; and therefore was pleased to declare, That as he abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all Superstitions of <hi>Popery,</hi> so he would be most careful that nothing should be allowed within his Dominions, but that which should most tend to the Advancement of the true Religion, as it was presently professed within his Ancient Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and that nothing was nor should be done therein, against the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Laws of that his Native Kingdom.</q>
The Rioters perceived by this Proclamation, that the King was more afraid than hurt: And seeing him begin to shrink, they resolved to put so many fears upon him one after another, as in the end might fashion him to their desires. First therefore they began with a new Petition, not of a rude Multitude: but of Noblemen, Barons, Ministers, Burgesses, and Commons (the very Flower of the whole Nation) against the <hi>Liturgie</hi> and <hi>Canons.</hi> This Petition being sent to the Courts, could do no less (and it did no more) than produce another Proclamation in Reply to the Substance of it, some Menaces being intermingled: but sweetned in the close, to give them the better relish. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty first lets them know the Piety of his Intent in appointing the <hi>Liturgie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 14.</note> assuring them,
<q>That he had no other end in it, than the maintenance of the true Religion there already professed, and the beating down of all Superstition; That nothing passed in the said Book, but what was seen and approved by himself, before the same was either divulged or printed; and that he was assured, That the Book it self would be a very ready means to preserve the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion there professed, of which he doubted not to give them sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in his own time. Which said, he lets them know, That such as had Assembled for subscribing the said Petition, had made themselves liable to his highest Censures, both in Life and Fortune; That notwithstanding, he was pleased to dispence with
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:54785:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the errour (upon a confidence that it proceeded rather from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous Zeal, than a disaffection to Sovereignty) on condition that they retired themselves upon notice hereof, as became good and dutiful Subjects. He interdicted also the like Concourse as had been lately made at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> upon pain of Treason; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding that none of them should repair to <hi>Sterling</hi> (to which the Term was then Adjourned) or any other place of Counsel and Session, without Warrant from the Lords of the Council; and that all such, of what sort soever (not being Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil or Session) which were not Inhabitants of the Town, should within six hours after publication thereof, depart the same, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they were so Licenced and Warranted as before is said, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of <hi>Treason:</hi> And finally, he concludes with this, That he would not shut his ears against any Petition, upon this or any other Subject, which they should hereafter tender to him; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the matter and form thereof be not prejudicial to his Regal Authority.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had his Majesty followed at the heels of this Proclamation, with a powerful Army, according to the Custom of his Predecessors, Kings of <hi>England,</hi> it might have done some good upon them. But Proclamations of Grace and Favour, if not backed by Arms, are but like Cannons charged with Powder, without Ball or Bullet, making more noise than execution; and serve for nothing in effect, but to make the Rebel insolent, and the Prince contemptible, as it proved in this: For on the very day, and immediately after the reading of it, it was encountered with a Protestation, published by the Earl of <hi>Hume,</hi> the Lord <hi>Lindsey,</hi> and others, justifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their Proceedings, disclaiming all his Majesties Offers of Grace and Pardon, and positively declaring their Resolution to go on as they had begun, till they had brought the business to the end intended. And in pursuance hereof, they erected a new Form of Government amongst themselves, despotical enough in respect of those who adhered unto them, and unaccountable to his Majesty for their Acts and Orders. This Government consisted of four Tables, for the four Orders of the State, that is to say, the Noblemen, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, Burgesses, and Ministers; each Order consulting at his own Table, of such things as were necessary for the carrying on of the Design; which being reduced into Form, were offered, debated, and concluded at the General Table, consisting of a choice number of Commissioners out of all the rest. And that this new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be looked on with the greater reverence, they fixed themselves in <hi>Edenborough,</hi> the Regal City, leaving the Lords of Council and Session to make merry at <hi>Sterling,</hi> where they had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle else to do than to follow their Pleasures. The Tables were no sooner formed, but they resolved upon renewing of the Ancient <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> of that <hi>Kirk,</hi> with a Band thereunto subjoined, but fitted and accommodated to the present occasion, which had been signed by
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:54785:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
King <hi>Iames</hi> on the 28th. of <hi>Ianuary, Anno</hi> 1580. after their Account, and generally subscribed by all the Nation. And by this Band they entred Covenant for Maintenance of their Religion then professed, and his Majesties Person: but aiming at the destruction of both; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth both by the Band it self, and their Gloss upon it: For by the one they had bound themselues to defend each other against all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whatsoever, the King himself not being excepted; and by the other they declared, That under the general Names of <hi>Popery, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> which were there expressed, they had abjured (and required all others so to do) not only the <hi>Liturgie</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> lately recommended to them, but the <hi>Episcopal Government,</hi> and the five <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Perth,</hi> though confirmed by Parliament. And to this Covenant, in this sense, they required an Oath of all the Subjects, which was as great an Usurpation of the Regal Power, as they could take upon themselves, for confirming their own Authority and the Peoples Obedience, in any Project whatsoever which should after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards issue from those Tables.</p>
                  <p>In this Estate we leave the <hi>Scots,</hi> and return to <hi>England,</hi> where we shall find all things in a better condition, at least as to the outward appearance, whatsoever secret workings were in agitation amongst the Grandees and chief Leaders of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction. Little or no noise raised about the publishing of the Book for Sports, or silencing the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrines, according to his Majesties Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration before the Articles: No clamour touching the transposing of the Holy Table, which went on leisurely in most places, vigorously in many, and in some stood still. The <hi>Metropolitical Visitation,</hi> and the Care of the Bishops, had settled these Particulars in so good a way, that mens Passions began to calm, and their Thoughts to come to some repose, when the Commands had been more seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered of, than at first they were. And now the Visitation having been carried into all parts of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> his <hi>Grace</hi> began to cast his eye upon the Islands of <hi>Guernsey</hi> and <hi>Iersey,</hi> two Islands lying on the Coast of <hi>Normandy,</hi> to the Dukedom whereof they once belonged, and in the Right of that Dukedom to the Crown of <hi>England. Iersey,</hi> the bigger of the two, more populous, and of richer soil: but of no great Trading. <hi>Guern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> the lesser, the more barren: but nourishing a wealthier People, Masters of many stout Barques, and managing a rich Trade with the neighbouring Nations. Attempted often by the <hi>French,</hi> since they seised on <hi>Normandy</hi>: but always with repulse and loss, the People being very affectionate to the <hi>English</hi> Government, under which they enjoy very ample Priviledges, which from the <hi>French</hi> they could not hope for. As parts of <hi>Normandy,</hi> they were subject in Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Matters to the Bishops of <hi>Constance</hi> in that Dukedom, and so continued till the Reformation of Religion here in <hi>England,</hi> and were then added to the Diocess and Jurisdiction of the Bishops of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester.</hi> But the <hi>Genevian</hi> Discipline being more agreeable to such
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:54785:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Preachers as came to them from <hi>France,</hi> they obtained the Exercise thereof in the eighth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Anno</hi> 1565. The whole Government distinguished into two <hi>Classes</hi> or Colonies; that of <hi>Iersey</hi> of it self being one, and that of <hi>Guernsey,</hi> with the Islands of <hi>Sark</hi> and <hi>Alderney,</hi> making up the other; both <hi>Classes</hi> meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a <hi>Synod</hi> every second or third year, according to the Order of their Book of Discipline, digested by <hi>Snape</hi> and <hi>Cartwright,</hi> (the two great Ring-leaders of that <hi>Faction</hi> here in <hi>England</hi>) in a <hi>Synod</hi> held at <hi>Guernsey, Iune</hi> 28. 1576. And this manner they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till the time of King <hi>Iames,</hi> when the Churches in the Isle of <hi>Iersey</hi> falling into some disorder, and being under an immediate Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour who was no great Friend to <hi>Calvin's</hi> Plat-form, they were necessitated, for avoiding of a greater mischief, to cast themselves into the Arms of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The principal Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Officer, whilst they were under the Bishops of <hi>Constance,</hi> had the Title of <hi>Dean</hi>; for each Island one; the several Powers both of the <hi>Chancellor</hi> and <hi>Archdeacon,</hi> being united in his Person. This Office is restored again, his Jurisdiction marked out, his Fees ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, his Revenue settled: but made accountable for his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, to the Bishops of <hi>Winchester.</hi> The <hi>English Liturgie</hi> is Translated also into <hi>French,</hi> to be read in their Churches: <hi>Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> first, and afterwards a Body of <hi>Canons</hi> framed, for Regulating both the Ministers and People in their several Duties; those <hi>Canons</hi> bearing date the last of <hi>Iune,</hi> in the one and twentieth year of that King.</p>
                  <p>For the confirming of this Island in their Conformity to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Forms of Worship there established, and the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the others to the like condition, it was resolved, That the <hi>Metropolitical Visitation</hi> should be held in each of them, at the next opening of the Spring. And that it might be carried on with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er assurance, the Archbishop had designed a Person for his Principal <hi>Visitor,</hi> who had spent some time in either Island, and was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Bayliffs, Ministers, and men of special note amongst them: But the Affairs of <hi>Scotland</hi> growing from bad to worse, this Counsel was discontinued for the present, and at last laid by for all together.</p>
                  <p>But these Islands were not out of his mind, though they were out of sight, his care extending further than his Visitation. The Islanders did use to breed such of their Sons as they designed for the Ministry either at <hi>Saumur</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> from whence they returned well sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned with the Leaven of <hi>Calvinism.</hi> No better way to purge that old Leaven out of the Islands than to allure the people to send their Children to <hi>Oxon</hi> or <hi>Cambridge</hi>; nor any better expedient to effect the same than to provide some preferments for them in our Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It hapned, that while he was intent on these Considerations, that one <hi>Hubbard,</hi> the Heir of Sir <hi>Miles Hubbard,</hi> Citizen and Alderman of <hi>London,</hi> departed this Life; to whom, upon an inquisition taken after
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:54785:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his death in due form of Law, no Heir was found which could lay claim to his Estate. Which falling to the Crown in such an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected manner, and being a fair Estate withal, it was no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Archbishop to perswade his Majesty to bestow some small part thereof upon pious uses. To which his Majesty consenting, there was so much allotted out of it, as for the present served suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to endow three Fellowships for the perpetual Education of so many of the Natives of <hi>Guernsey</hi> and <hi>Iersey</hi>; not without some probable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By means whereof he did both piously and prudently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for those Islands, and the advancement of Conformity amongst them in the times to come. For what could else ensue upon it: but that the breeding of some Scholars out of those Islands in that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, where they might throughly acquaint themselves with the Doctrine, Government, and Forms of Worship establisht in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they might afterwards at their return to their native Countries, reduce the Natives by degrees to conform unto it; which doubtless in a short time would have done the work with as much honour to the King, and content to himself, as satisfaction to those People.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be thought that the Papists were all this while asleep, and that neither the disquiets in <hi>England,</hi> nor the tumults in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were husbanded to the best advantage of the Catholick Cause. <hi>Panzani,</hi> as before is said, had laid the foundation of an Agency or constant correspondence between the Queens Court and the Popes; and having so done, left the pursuit of the design to <hi>Con</hi> a <hi>Scot,</hi> by birth, but of a very busie and pragmatical head. Arriving in <hi>England</hi> about the middle of Summer, <hi>Anno</hi> 1636. he brought with him many pretended reliques of Saints, Medals and Pieces of Gold with the Popes Picture stamped on them, to be distributed amongst those of that Party, but principally amongst the Ladies of the Court and Country, to whom he made the greatest part of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. He found the King and Queen at <hi>Holdenby</hi> House, and by the Queen was very graciously entertained, and took up his chief Lodgings in a house near the new Exchange. As soon as the Court was returned to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> he applied himself diligently to his work, practising upon some of the principal Lords, and making himself very plausible with the King himself, who hoped he might make some use of him in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> for facilitating the restitution of the Prince <hi>Elector.</hi> And finding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Kings Councils were much directed by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he used his best endeavours to be brought into his acquaintance. But <hi>Canterbury</hi> neither liked the man, nor the Message which he came about, and therefore kept himself at a distance, neither admitting him to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:54785:182"/>
nor Communication. Howsoever by the Kings Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence, and the Queens Indulgence, the <hi>Popish</hi> Faction gathered not only strength, but confidence; multiplying in some numbers about the Court, and resorting in more open manner to the Masses at <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset</hi> house, where the <hi>Capuchins</hi> had obtained both a <hi>Chappel</hi> and <hi>Convent.</hi> Of this none bears the blame but <hi>Laud,</hi> who is traduced in Libels and common talk for the principal Architect in the Plot, and the Contriver of the mischief.</p>
                  <p>On this account, and the proceedings of the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remembred, one Libel is dropt at the <hi>South</hi> Gate of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> on <hi>August</hi> 23. declaring that the Devil had left that house to him for the saying of Mass, and other abominations of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; another two daies after fastned to the <hi>North</hi> Gate of it, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that the Church of <hi>England was like a Candle in a Snuff, going out in a stench.</hi> His Speech in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> put into a kind of <hi>Pillory,</hi> and hanged up at the Standard in <hi>Cheapside</hi>; and another short Libel made against him in Verse four daies after that. Awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by so many Alarms he had good cause to look about him, but more at the great noise, not long after raised, about the seducing of the Countess of <hi>Newport,</hi> a Kinswoman of the late Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghams,</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; effected by the Practices of <hi>Walter Mountague,</hi> a younger Son of the Earl of <hi>Manchester,</hi> and the importunities of <hi>Toby Matthews,</hi> (an undeserving Son of a worthy Father) <hi>Con</hi> interposing in it as he found occasion. The Archbishop had long stomackt at the Insolencies of <hi>Matthews,</hi> and <hi>Mountague,</hi> and had forborn the taking of any publick notice of them, till he had almost lost himself in the sight of the people. But laying hold on this opportunity, he passionately declares himself at the Council Table, on <hi>October</hi> 22. in a full and free Speech to the King, concerning the increase of the <hi>Roman</hi> Party, the frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort of Papists to <hi>Somerset</hi> house, the unsufferable misdemeanors of <hi>Matthews,</hi> and <hi>Mountague,</hi> in practicing upon his Subjects, and chiefly upon those which lived within the verge of the Court, and were nearest to him, humbly beseeching him to put some strong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint upon them, whereby they either might be barred from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Court at all, or to give no offence and scandal by their misbehaviours. Of this the Queen had notice that very night, who seemed much displeased at the matter, and let him see it in her Countenance, whensoever he had any cause of coming where she was. But the Pill was given in a very good hour, and wrought so effectually with the King, that <hi>Mountague</hi> and <hi>Matthews</hi> were purged out of the Court; the one betaking himself to his Country practice, the other for a time to his former travels in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> Which the Queen finding to be past remedy, and knowing how necessary a Servant the Archbishop was to his <hi>Great Master,</hi> and how useful he might be to her in her own affairs, she admitted him to her speech again in <hi>December</hi> following; and after some expostulations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:54785:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it was affirmed by some moderate men, that the Doctor in those two Sermons had pulled up Popery by the very roots; one of the company replying thereunto, That the Archbishop might Print, and the Doctor might Preach what they pleased against Popery, but that he should never think them, or either of them, to be the less Papists for all that. A Censure of so strange a nature, and so little savouring of Christianity, that I believe it is not easie to be paralelled in the worst of times. And when no Priest nor Jesuite could be found so confident as to venture on an Answer to it, one of the <hi>Presbyterian Scots</hi> (for such he was then generally affirmed to be) published an unlicenced Piece against him, under the Title of <hi>A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to a Relation of the Conference betwixt</hi> William Laud <hi>and Mr.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher <hi>the Iesuite,</hi> said to be writ <hi>by a Witness of Iesus Christ.</hi> In the whole course whereof the Author, whosoever he was, most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably perverts his words, and mistakes his meaning, wresting the most Orthodox and innocent truths to his wicked ends, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his own corrupt Gloss and sense upon them. And which is yet most strange of all, with an unparalelled impudence he dedicates it to his Sacred Majesty, calling upon him,
<q>To send out his Royal Edict for the taking down of all Altars, (which where ever they stand, are by him said to stand in open defiance of Christ;) Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for calling in the Book for Sports on the Lords day; A third, for calling in his Declaration before the Articles of Religion; A fourth for calling in of all Orders for the Restraint of Preaching; A fifth, for restoring to their place and Ministry all those who out of Conscience of their duty to God had by the Prelates been thrust out of all for refusing to read the said Book; And finally, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leasing and setting at liberty the three poor banished prisoners, the loud cry of whose oppressions might otherwise provoke the thunderbolt of Divine Revenge to blast the beauty of his State.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as he laboured by these means to preserve the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the growth of <hi>Popery,</hi> so he took care for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the subversion of it, by the spreading of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Heresies. He had before took care for suppressing all Books of that nature which had been imported into <hi>England</hi> out of other Countries, and had received thanks for it from the Pen of a Jesuit: But <hi>Burton</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it upon him among his Crimes, reproaching him for suppressing those books for no other reason but because they magnified the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the holy Scriptures; and by the late Decree for Printing (of which more anon) he had took such order, that no Eggs of that pestiferous Brood should be laid in <hi>England,</hi> or if they were, should ever peep out of the Shell, or appear in sight. There had been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished a Discourse, called, <hi>Disquisitio Brevis,</hi> in which some of the principal <hi>Socinian</hi> Tenents were cunningly inserted, pretending them for the best Expedients to appease some Controversies betwixt us and <hi>Rome</hi>: The Book ascribed in common Speech to <hi>Hales</hi> of <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
                     <pb n="362" facs="tcp:54785:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a man of infinite reading, and no less ingenuity; free of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and as communicative of his knowledge as the Coelestial Bodies of their light and influences. There past also up and down a Discourse of <hi>Schism,</hi> not Printed, but transmitted from hand to hand in written Copies (like the Bishop of <hi>Lincolns</hi> Letter to the <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Grantham</hi>) intended chiefly for the encouragement of some of our great Masters of Wit and Reason, to despise the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church. Which being dispersed about this time, gave the Archbishop occasion to send for him to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> in hope that he might gain the man, whose abilities he was well acquainted with when he lived in <hi>Oxon.</hi> An excellent <hi>Grecian</hi> in those daies, and one whom <hi>Savil</hi> made great use of in his <hi>Greek</hi> Edition of St. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms</hi> Works. About nine of the Clock in the Morning he came to know his Graces pleasure, who took him along with him into his Garden, commanding that none of his Servants should come at him upon any occasion. There they continued in discourse till the Bell rang to Prayers, and after Prayers were ended, till the Dinner was ready, and after that too, till the coming in of the Lord <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> and some other Persons or honour, put a necessity upon some of his Servants to give him notice how the time had passed away. So in they came, high coloured, and almost panting for want of breath; enough to shew, that there had been some heats between them, not then fully cooled. It was my chance to be there that day, either to know his Graces pleasure, or to render an account of some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer commands, but I know not which; and I found <hi>Hales</hi> very glad to see me in that place, as being himself a meer stranger to it, and unknown to all. He told me afterwards, That he found the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop (whom he knew before for a nimble Disputant) to be as well versed in books as business; That he had been ferretted by him from one hole to another, till there was none left to afford him any further shelter; That he was now resolved to be Orthodox, and to declare himself a true Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> both for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Discipline; That to this end he had obtained leave to call himself his <hi>Graces</hi> Chaplain, that naming him in his Publick Prayers for his Lord and Patron, the greater notice might be taken of the Alteration. Thus was <hi>Hales</hi> gained unto the Church, and gained a good preferment in it; promoted not long after by the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Commendation to be Prebend of <hi>Windsor,</hi> and to hold the same by special dispensation, with his place in <hi>Eaton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor was the Archbishop less intent upon all Advantages for keeping down the <hi>Genevian</hi> Party, and hindring them from Printing and Publishing any thing which might disturb the Churches Peace, or corrupt her Doctrine. To this end he procured a Decree to be pass'd in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> on <hi>Iuly</hi> 1. <hi>Anno</hi> 1637. to Regulate the Trade of <hi>Printing,</hi> and prevent all Abuses of that Excellent Art, to the disturbance of the Church. By which Decree it had been Ordered, <hi>That the Master-Printers
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:54785:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from thenceforth should be reduced to a certain number; and that if any other should secretly or openly pursue that Trade, he should be set in the Pillory, or whipped through the Streets, and suffer such other Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment as that Court should inflict upon him; That none of the said Master-Printers should from thenceforth Print any Book or Books of Divinity, Law, Physick, Philosophy, or Poetry, till the said Books, together with the Titles, Epistles, Prefaces, Tables, or Commendatory Verses, shall be lawfully Licenced, either by the Archbishop of</hi> Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>or the Bishop of</hi> London <hi>for the time being, or by some of their Chaplains, or by the Chancellors or Vice-Chancellors of either of the two Vniversities, upon pain of loosing the Exercise of his Art, and being proceeded against in the</hi> Star-Chamber, <hi>or the</hi> High-Commission <hi>Court respectively; That no Person or Persons do hereafter Re-print, or cause to be Re-printed, any Book or Books whatsoever (though formerly Printed with Licence) without being reviewed, and a new Licence obtained for the Re-printing thereof: That every Merchant, Bookseller, or other Person, who shall Import any Printed Books from beyond the Seas, shall present a true Catalogue of them to the said Archbishop or Bishop for the time being, before they be delivered, or exposed to Sale, upon pain of suffering such Punishment as by either of the said two Courts respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall be thought fit; That none of the said Merchants, Booksellers, or others, shall upon pain of the like Punishment, deliver any of the Books so Imported, till the Chaplains of the said Archbishop or Bishop for the time being, or some other Learned Man by them appointed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Master and Wardens of the Company of</hi> Stationers, <hi>or one of them, shall take a view of the same, with Power to seize on all such Books which they found to be Schismatical and Offensive, and bring them to the said Archbishop or Bishop, or to the</hi> High-Commission <hi>Office: And finally, That no Merchant, Bookseller,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>should Print, or cause to be Printed beyond the Seas, any Book or Books, which either totally, or for the greatest part, were written in the</hi> English <hi>Tongue, whether the said Books have been here formerly Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or not; nor shall willingly or knowingly Import any such Books into this Kingdom, upon pain of being proceeded against in either of the said two Courts respectively, as before is said.</hi> By means of which Decree he had so provided both at home and abroad, That neither the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the State should be exercised (as in former times) with continual Libels; nor the Church troubled by unwarrantable and Out-landish Doctrines.</p>
                  <p>But good Laws are of no effect without execution; and if he took no care for that, he had lost his labour. King <hi>Iames</hi> had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested his dislike of the <hi>Genevian</hi> Bibles, and the Notes upon them; some of which did not only teach Disobedience to Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but the murthering of them also, if they proved Idolaters; and others did not only teach the Lawfulness of breaking Faith and Promise, when the keeping of it might conduce to the hurt of the Gospel: but ranked Archbishops, Bishops, and all men in Holy

Orders, or <hi>Academical Degrees,</hi> amongst those <hi>Locusts</hi> in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> which came out of the Pit. That King gave Order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, That the Bible of the New Translation should be printed with no Notes at all; which course he also recommended to the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> to be observed in the new Translation of the Bible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>German</hi> Tongue, which was then intended. Upon this ground, the Printing of those Bibles with Notes upon them had been forbidden in this Kingdom: but were Printed in <hi>Holland</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, and brought over hither, the better to keep up the Faction, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Some of them had before been sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in <hi>Holland,</hi> by the care of <hi>Boswel</hi> the Resident at the <hi>Hague:</hi> And in the beginning of this year, he received Advertisement of a new Impression of the same designed for <hi>England,</hi> if the terrour of this Decree did not stop their coming.

Of these he had Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement from time to time, by one <hi>Iohn Le Maire</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, by the means of <hi>Boswell</hi> his right trusty Friend, he dealt so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually with the <hi>States-General</hi> of those Provinces, that they made a Proclamation against the Printers and Spreaders of Libellous and Seditious Books against the Church and Prelates of <hi>England</hi>;<note place="margin">

                  <p>There was a time when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> beheld the Pope as her greatest Enemy, in reference to her Mothers Marriage, her own Birth, and consequently her Title to the Crown of <hi>England</hi>; and many of the Books which were Printed in and about that time, were full of bitterness and revilings against the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and all the Divine Offices, Ceremonies, and Performances of it. There was a time also when the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrines were embraced by many for the Genuine Doctrines of this Church, to the great countenancing of the <hi>Genevian</hi> Discipline and Forms of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration: And not a few of the Books then Printed, and such as after were Licenced in <hi>Abbot</hi>'s Time, aimed principally at the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of those Opinions, which the latter Times found inconsistent with the Churches Doctrines. With equal diligence he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Decree to hinder the Reprinting of the one and the other, that so the Church might rest in quiet, without any trouble or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestation in her self, or giving offence to any other.</p>
                  <p>As little Trouble could be feared from Lecturers, as they now were Regulated. The greatest part of those who had been Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into other Mens Cures (like a <hi>Doctor</hi> added to the <hi>Pastor</hi> in
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:54785:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Plat-form) had deserted their Stations, because they would not read the Common-Prayers in their Hoods and Surplices, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Kings Instructions before remembred; such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained being either founded on a constant or certain Maintenance, or seeing how little was to be gotten by a fiery and ungoverned Zeal, became more pliant and conformable to the Rules of the Church: Not a Lecturer of this kind found to stand out in some great Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, to keep up the Spirits of the Faction, and create disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And as for Combination-Lecturers, named for the most part by the Bishops, and to them accountable, they also were required in some places to read the second Service at the Communion-Table, to go into the Pulpit at the end of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, to use no other form of Prayer than that of the 55th. <hi>Canon,</hi> after the Sermon end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to go back to the Table, and there read the Service. All which being to be done in their Hoods and Surplices, kept off the greatest part of the rigid <hi>Calvinists</hi> from exercising their Gifts, as formerly in great Market-Towns. And as for the position of the Communion-Table, it was no longer left to private Instructions, as it was at the first, when the Inquiry went no further, than, <hi>Whether the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was so conveniently placed, that the Minister might best be seen and heard of the Congregation</hi>? The more particular disposing of it, being left to Inference, Conjecture, or some private Directions. It now began to be more openly avowed in the <hi>Visitation-Articles</hi> of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Bishops and Archdeacons, some of which we shall here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, as a light to the rest: For thus we find it in the Articles for the <hi>Archdeaconry</hi> of <hi>Buckingham, Anno</hi> 1637. <hi>Art.</hi> 5. <hi>Have you a decent Table, or a Frame for the Holy Communion, placed at the East end of the Chancel? Is it Railed in or Enclosed, so as Men or Boys can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sit upon it, or throw their Hats upon it? Is the said Rail and Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure so made with Settles and kneeling-Benches, at the foot or bottom thereof, as the Communicants may fitly kneel there at the Receiving of the Holy Communion?</hi> The like for the Diocess of <hi>Norwich</hi> in the year before,<note place="margin">

And is the same placed conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently, so as the Minister may best be heard in his Administration, and the greatest number may reverently Communicate? To that end, Doth it ordinarily stand up at the East end of the Chancel, where the Altar in former times stood, the ends thereof being placed North and South?</hi> And in another Article it is thus inquired, <hi>viz. Do all your Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of what sort soever, according as the Church expresly them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, draw neer, and with all Christian Humility and Reverence, come to the Lords Table, when they are to receive the Holy Communion?</hi> But because these Articles might be thought too general, if not otherwise limited, certain <hi>Injunctions</hi> were annexed in Writing, in one of which it was required, <hi>That the said Tables should be Railed in, to avoid Prophanations</hi>; and secondly, <hi>That all Communicants should come up by Files, and Receive the Sacrament at the same.</hi> Which
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:54785:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was performed in this manner: As many as could well kneel close to the Rails, came up out of the Church or Chancel, and then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their knees received (from the Priest standing within the Rails) the Bread and Wine; who being thus Communicated, retired into the Church or Chancel, and made room for others. Which course was constantly observed, till they had all Received the Sacrament in their ranks and forms, according to the ancient Custom of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; till Novellism, and Compliance with the Forms of <hi>Geneva,</hi> had introduced a deviation from their own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments.</p>
                  <p>In this condition stood that Diocess, as to these particulars, when <hi>Wren,</hi> translated unto <hi>Ely,</hi> left the place to <hi>Mountague</hi>; who though he was as zealous, and as forward as he in railing in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Table at the East end of the Chancel where the Altar stood, (as appears by his Visitation Articles for this present year) yet he had fancied to himself a middle Course between receiving at the Rail and carrying the Communion to all parts of the Church, as had been most irreverently used in too many places. And therefore that he might do somewhat to be called his own, he caused a meeting of the Clergy to be held at <hi>Ipswich</hi> for the parts adjoyning, where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed these following Orders: That is to say,
<q>First, After the the words, or Exhortation pronounced by the Minister (standing at the Communion Table, the Parishioners as yet standing in the body of the Church) <hi>Draw near,</hi> &amp;c. all which intended to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate should come out of the Church into the Chancel, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That all being come in, the Chancel door should be shut, and not opened till the Communion be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant depart till the Dismission; That no new Communicant come in amongst them; And that no Boys, Girls, or Gazers be suffered to look in as at a Play. Thirdly, That the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants being entred should be disposed of orderly in their several Ranks, leaving sufficient room for the Priest or Minister to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; by whom they were to be communicated one Rank after another, till they had all of them received. Fourthly, and finally, That after they had all received, the Priest or Minister should dismiss them with the Benediction.</q>
Which though it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered very little from the Rules prescribed by his Predecessor, yet some diversity there was, for which he rendred an account to his Metropolitan, and was by <hi>Wren</hi> sufficiently answered in all points thereof. It was not coming up to the Raile, but going into the Chancel, which had been stomacked, and opposed by the Puritan Faction, who loved to make all places equal, and to observe as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reverence in the Participation as in all other Acts of Worship: Which <hi>Mountague</hi> either not considering or fancying to himself some hopes which he had no ground for, resolved to fall upon this course, which he conceived to be more agreeable to the course of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and most consistent as he thought with the Rules of Politie. For
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:54785:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by this condescension he presumed, as himself informs us, to keep many men at home with their Wives and Families, in obedience to his Majesties Laws, who otherwise were upon a resolution of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingdom; wherein how much he was deceived, the event dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
                  <p>For so it was, that the people in many great trading Towns, which were near the Sea, having been long discharged of the Bond of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, no sooner came to hear the least noise of a Conformity, but they began to spurn against it. And when they found that all their striving was in vain, that they had lost the comfort of their Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and that their Ministers began to shrink at the very name of a Visitation, it was no hard matter for those Ministers and Lecturers to perswade them to remove their dwellings, and transport their Trades. The Sun of Heaven, say they, doth shine as comfortably in other places, the Son of Righteousness much brighter: Better to go and dwell in <hi>Goshen,</hi> find it where we can, than tarry in the midst of such an <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkness as was then falling on this Land. The sinful corruptions of the Church (said they) were now grown so general, that there was no place free from that Contagion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of it; and <hi>therefore go out of her my people, and be not parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of her sins.</hi> And hereunto they were the more easily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by seeing so many Dutch men with their Wives and Children to forsake the Kingdom; who having got Wealth enough in <hi>England,</hi> chose rather to go back to their Native Countries, than to be obliged to resort to their Parish Churches, as by the Archbishops Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they were bound to do. Amongst the first which separated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account were <hi>Goodwin, Nye, Burroughs, Bridge,</hi> and <hi>Sympson</hi>; who taking some of their followers with them, betook themselves to <hi>Holland,</hi> as their City of Refuge. There they filled up their Congregations to so great a number, that it was thought fit to be divided; <hi>Goodwin</hi> and <hi>Nye</hi> retiring unto <hi>Arnheim,</hi> a Town of <hi>Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland; Sympson</hi> and <hi>Bridge</hi> fixing at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi>: but what became of <hi>Burroughs</hi> I am yet to seek. These men a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>fecting neither the severe Discipline of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> nor the Licenciousness incident to <hi>Brownism,</hi> embraced <hi>Robinsons</hi> Moddel of Church-Government in their Congregations, consisting of a Coordination of several Churches for their mutual comfort, not a Subordination of the one to the other, in the way of direction or command. Hence came that name of <hi>Independents,</hi> continued unto those amongst us, who neither associate themselves with the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> nor embrace the Frensies of the <hi>Anabaptists.</hi> But they soon found the Folly of their Divisions, <hi>Rotterdam</hi> growing too narrow a place for <hi>Bridge</hi> and <hi>Sympson,</hi> so that this last was forced to leave it, and <hi>Ward</hi> who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him could not tarry long. More unity there was at <hi>Arnheim,</hi> where their Preachers did not think they had done enough in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their new Church to the Pattern which they saw in the Mount, if it were not Apostolical in the highest perfection: To
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:54785:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                  <p>The curteous entertainment which these people found in the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> Provinces, might easily have served for a strong temptation to bring over the rest to enjoy the like: But the Country was too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for them, and the Brethren of the Separation desired elbow-room for fear of <hi>Enterfeering</hi> with one another. <hi>New-England</hi> was chiefly in their eye, a <hi>Puritan</hi> Plantation from the first beginning, and therefore fitter for the growth of the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> or <hi>Calvinian</hi> Gospel than any Country whatsoever. A Country first discovered to any purpose by one Captain <hi>Gosnold, Anno</hi> 1602. and in the next year more perfectly surveyed by some of <hi>Bristol</hi>; afterwards granted by King <hi>Iames, Anno</hi> 1606. unto a Corporation of Knights, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Merchants, to be planted and disposed of for the Publick, under the Ordering and Direction of Chief Justice <hi>Popham,</hi> by whom a Colony was sent thither in the year next following; at what time they built St. <hi>Georges</hi> Fort to secure their Haven, that they might have a door open for their going thence, which soon after fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. And though the Adventurers made a further attempt in the year 1616, yet it never settled into Form till the building of <hi>New-Plymouth,</hi> in the year 1620. and some incouragements being sent thence to bring others on, it came in very short space to so swift a growth, that no <hi>Plantation</hi> for the time ever went beyond it; <hi>New Bristol,</hi> new <hi>Boston,</hi> and new <hi>Barnstable,</hi> being quickly added to the other. <note n="(a)" place="margin">

                     <hi>de Laet</hi> a right good <hi>Chorographer,</hi> in the third Book of his Description of <hi>America,</hi> where he informeth us, that the first Planters, and those which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after them were altogether of that Sect, which in <hi>England</hi> were called <hi>Brownists</hi> or <hi>Puritans</hi>; many of which had formerly betaken themselves to <hi>Holland,</hi> but afterwards departed thence to joyn with their Brethren in <hi>New-England.</hi> The Churches cast into the same mould with those before, all of them following the device of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binson,</hi> that notorious <hi>Schismatick,</hi> at the spawning of the second separation in <hi>Amsterdam</hi>: Who, to distinguish his followers from the brethren of the first separation governed by a Try-formed <hi>Presbytery</hi> of Pastors, Elders, and Deacons, introduced a new way of his own, leaving as much Exercise of Church Discipline to the whole Congregation, as was elsewhere enjoyed by the Pastors and Elders.</p>
                  <p>In this estate they stood in the year 1633. at what time <hi>Iohn de

Laet</hi> made that Character of them: Exceedingly encreased in short time after, both in Men and Buildings, by those who frequently flocked thither from most parts of this Kingdom, either for fear of Punishment, or for danger of Debt, or to enjoy the folly of their Schism with the greater safety. But whatsoever were the causes of the Separation, certain I am, the Crime was laid on the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> amongst the Articles of whose Impeachment by the House of Commons, I find this for one, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>That in his own Person, and his Suffragans, Visitors, Surrogates, Chancellors, or other Officers by his Command, he had caused divers Learned, Pious, and Orthodox Preachers of Gods Word to be silenced, suspended, deprived, degraded, excommunicated, or otherwise grieved and vexed without any just and lawful cause; whereby, and by divers other means he hath hindred the Preaching of Gods Word, <hi>and caused divers of his Majesties Subjects to forsake the Kingdom.</hi>

So is the Judge to be accused for all those mischiefs, which the condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Malefactors, when they once break Prison, may design and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute. The principal Bell-weathers of these Flocks, were <hi>Cotton, Chancy, Wells, Hooker,</hi> and perhaps <hi>Hugh Peters</hi>; the rest, let them look after, who affect such Company. Not much took notice of at the first, when they were few in Numbers, and inconsiderable for their Power: but growing up so fast both in strength and multitude, they began to carry a face of danger. For how unsafe must it be thought both to Church and State, to suffer such a constant Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of discontented, dangerous, and schismatical Persons, to grow up so fast; from whence, as from the Bowels of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horse, so many Incendiaries might break out to inflame the Nation? <hi>New-England,</hi> like the Spleen in the Natural Body, by drawing to it so many sullen, sad, and offensive Humours, was not unuseful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviceable to the General Health: But when the Spleen is grown once too full, and emptieth it self into the Stomach, it both cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the Blood, and disturbs the Head, and leaves the whole man wearisom to himself and others. And therefore to prevent such mischiefs as might thence ensue, it was once under Consultation of the chief Physicians, who were to take especial care of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Health, to send a Bishop over to them, for their better Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and back him with some Forces to compel, if he were not otherwise able to perswade Obedience. But this Design was stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in the first Conception, by the violent breakings out of the Troubles in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which call upon us from this place to look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them.</p>
                  <p>And now again we are for <hi>Scotland,</hi> where we spent the last year in doing nothing, and shall spend this in doing that which was worse than nothing. The Insolencies of the <hi>Covenanters</hi> were now grown so great, that some advised the King to take the Sword into his hand, and to reduce them to Obedience by force of Arms, before they had ripened their Intelligences, and formed a Party to their will both at

home and abroad: But the King would not hearken to it, resolved upon his Fathers way of sending Commissioners, and trying what he might effect by Treaty and Negotiation. Which Resolution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, the next Consideration was for the choice of the man. The well-affected <hi>Scots</hi> pitched on the Marquis of <hi>Huntley,</hi> a man of great Power in his own Country, true to the King, and a professed Enemy to the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> And to this end the Earl of <hi>Sterling</hi> Principal Secretary of Estate, the Bishops of <hi>Ross</hi> and <hi>Brechin</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-Counsellors both, <hi>Hay</hi> the Clerk-Register, and <hi>Spotswood</hi> Lord President of the <hi>Sessions</hi> (a most deserving Son of a Reverend Father) made a journey thence unto the King, and used their best Endeavours with him, to commit the managing of that great Trust into <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And so far had the man prevailed by his Arts and Instruments, that the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> was brought over to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute his Assistances to him; and rather chose to commend the known Enemy of his House to that great Employment, than that a private Country-Gentleman (such as <hi>Huntley</hi> was) should carry the Honour from them both. And therefore briefly in this place to speak of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and his Proceedings in the weighty Charge committed to him (in which he hath been generally suspected to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray his Master) we will fetch the Story somewhat higher, that we may see what ends he aimed at for himself, and what enclined him rather to foment than quench the Flames which had been kindled in that Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Know therefore, That the <hi>Hamiltonian</hi> Family derives it self from one <hi>Hamilton</hi> an <hi>Englishman,</hi> who went to try what Fortunes he could find in <hi>Scotland</hi>: Neither himself nor his Posterity of any great note, till <hi>Iames</hi> iii. bearing a great affection to Sir <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> married him to one of his Sisters whom he had forcibly taken from the Lord <hi>Boyd</hi> her former Husband. From this unlawful Marriage descended another <hi>Iames,</hi> the Grandchild of this, as impious and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of this last Marriage came <hi>Iohn</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> Created by King <hi>Iames</hi> vi. the first Marquis of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Father of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and Grandfather of <hi>Iames</hi> Marquis of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> of whom we now speak.

as on the Heads of any which descended from a Daughter of <hi>Iames</hi> v. To give some life unto his Fancies, he found the Great Men amongst the <hi>Scots</hi> in high discontentments, about the Revocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Church-Lands, which the King then busily intended: The Popular Party in <hi>England</hi> no less discontented, by the Dissolving of three Parliaments one after another; and the <hi>Puritans</hi> in both, by the great Power and Credit which some Bishops had attained unto in either Kingdom. In which conjuncture, it was not hard for him to conceive, That he might make unto himself a strong Party in That, without fear of any opposition to be made from This.

Many days were spent accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in pursuance of it: But when most men expected that the matter would be tried by Battel, as had been accustomed in such cases, the Business was hushed up at Court, the Lord <hi>Ree</hi> dismissed to his Employment in the Wars, and, contrary to the mind of all good men, the Marquis did not only continue in the Kings great Favour: but <hi>Ramsey</hi> was permitted to hold the Place of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Privy-Chamber, which had been formerly procured for him.</p>

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:54785:189"/>
Daughter of King <hi>Iames</hi> ii. The first was <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Menteith,</hi> descended from an Heir-general of <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Stratherne,</hi> one of the younger Sons of King <hi>Robert</hi> ii. as before was said: A man o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> sound Abilities and approved Affections, and therefore by the King made President of the Council in <hi>Scotland:</hi> In which Office he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himself, and stood so stoutly in behalf of the King his Master upon all occasions, that nothing could be done for Advance of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltons</hi> Designs, till he was removed from that Place. In order whereunto, it was put into his head by some of that Faction, that he should sue unto the King to be Created Earl of <hi>Stratherne,</hi> as the first and most honourable Title which belonged to his House; That his Merits were so great, as to assure him not to meet with a denial; and that the King could do no less, than to give him some nominal Reward for his real Services. On these Suggestions, he repaired to the Court of <hi>England</hi> 1632. where without any great difficulty, he obtained his Suit, and waited on the King the most part of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-Progress; no man being so openly honoured, and courted by the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation, as he seemed to be: But no sooner was he gone for <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the <hi>Hamiltonians</hi> terrified the King with the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which he had run into by that Creation, whereby he had revived in that proud and ambitious Person, the Rights which his Ancestors pretended to the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi>; That the King could not chuse but see how generally the <hi>Scots</hi> flock'd about him (after his Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) when he was at the Court, and would do so much more when he was in <hi>Scotland</hi>: And finally, That the proud man already had so far declared himself, as to give it out, <hi>That the King held the Crown of him.</hi> Hereupon a Commission was speedily posted into <hi>Scotland</hi> (in which those of <hi>Hamiltons</hi> Faction made the greatest number) to inquire into his Life and Actions, and to consider of the Inconveniencies which might redound unto the King by his affecting this new Title. On the Return whereof, the poor Gentleman is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from his Office, from being one of the Privy Council; and not only deprived of the Title of the Earl of <hi>Stratherne,</hi> but of that also of <hi>Menteith,</hi> which for a long time had remained in his Ancestors. And though he was not long after made Earl of <hi>Airth,</hi> yet this great fall did so discourage him from all Publick Businesses, that he retired to his own House, and left the way open to the <hi>Hamiltonians</hi> to play their own Game as they listed. Faithful for all this to the King, in all changes of Fortune; neither adhering to the <hi>Covenanters,</hi> nor giving the least countenance to them, when he might not only have done it with safety, but with many personal Advantages which were tendred him.</p>
                  <p>The other Bar to be thrust back, was the Earl of <hi>Montross,</hi> of the same House, and descended from the same Original; as plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the Souldiers and Men of War, as his Cosin of <hi>Menteith</hi> was powerful at the Council-Table. This man returning out of <hi>France</hi> in the flower and Bravery of his Age, had an intent of putting
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:54785:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
himself into the Kings Service, and was advised to make his way by the Marquis of <hi>Hamilton</hi>; who, knowing the Gallantry of the Man, and fearing a Competitor in his Majesties Favour, cunningly told him, That he would do him any Service: but that the King was so wholly given up to the <hi>English,</hi> and so discountenanced and slighted the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation, that were it not for doing Service to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (which the King intended to reduce into the form of a Province) he could not suffer the Indignities which were put upon him. This done, he repairs unto the King, tells him of the Earls return from <hi>France,</hi> and of his purpose to attend him at the time appointed: but that he was so Powerful, so Popular, and of such esteem amongst the <hi>Scots,</hi> by reason of an old Descent from the Royal Family, that if he were not <hi>nipped in the bud</hi> (as we use to say) he might indanger the Kings interest and affairs in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Earl being brought unto the King, with very great demonstrations of affection on the <hi>Marquis</hi> his part, the King without taking any great notice of him, gave him his hand to kiss, and so turned aside; which confirmed him in the truth of that false Report, which <hi>Hamilton</hi> had delivered to him: So that in great displeasure and disdain, he makes for <hi>Scotland.</hi> There finds he Colonel <hi>Alexander Lesly</hi> (an obscure fellow, but made rich with the Spoils of <hi>Germany</hi>) as discontented as himself, for being denied the honourable Title of a <hi>Baron,</hi> which he ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously sought for at the Kings being there. And he found them there also, who perceived on what foot he halted, and knew well how to work on such humours as he brought along with him, till by second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Information which he had brought from <hi>Hamilton,</hi> they had fashioned him wholly to their will: For they prevailed so far upon him, that at the first he cordially espoused their Quarrel against the <hi>Liturgie</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> and whatsoever else they found fault withal in the Publick Government; he being one of those Great Persons (and as forward as any of them all) who published a <hi>Protestation</hi> at the Cross in <hi>Edenborough,</hi> against one of his Majesties Proclamations of Grace and Favour: But afterwards, being displeased that <hi>Lesly</hi> was preferred before him in Commanding the Army; and looking thereupon more carefully into the depth of the Design than at first he did, he estranged himself from them by degrees, and at last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the most eminent Instrument that ever his Majesty imployed in his Wars with that People.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Hamilton</hi> had another remove to make, without which all the rest were nothing; and that was the removing of the Earl of <hi>Mar</hi> from the Custody and Command of the Castle of <hi>Edenborough</hi> (some time Hereditary to that House) and gaining it unto himself. To this Remove the Earl consented, because he found how earnestly his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty desired it of him, from whom he received a Compensation in Money for it. At so great charge was the King, to put <hi>Hamilton</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as full possession of the Strengths of that City, as he had got be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the hearts of the Citizens. The way being thus prepared,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:54785:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and all Rules removed, on <hi>Saturday May</hi> 26. he set forwards for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and in short time came to <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> an House of the Earl of <hi>Mortons</hi> four Miles from <hi>Edenborough,</hi> where he reposed himself a while; that he might make his Entry into the City with the greater honour. After some seeming diffidences betwixt him and the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters,</hi> he puts himself into <hi>Holy-Rood</hi> House, where the first thing he did, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

could not but be sure, that after so many previous Condescensions on his part, they would be able to do whatsoever they listed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of him.</p>
                  <p>For, before the Assembly was Indicted, the <hi>Covenanters</hi> had so laid the Plot, that none but those of their own Party should have Suffrage in it; as afterwards by several Orders from their Tables, they directed that no Chaplain, nor Chapter-man, nor any who have not subscribed the <hi>Covenant,</hi> should be chosen to it; not suffering the Archbishops or Bishops to sit as Moderators in their <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> where the Elections were to pass; and citing them to appear as Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Persons at the said Assembly: by means of which Exclusions and Prelimitations, the greatest part of the Assembly did consist of such as either were irregularly chosen by the over-ruling Voices of <hi>Lay-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> which were thrust upon them, or else not capable of being Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, some of them being under the Censures of the <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> others under the Censures of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and some not having taken the Oath of <hi>Supremacy</hi> required by the Laws of the Land. Upon which just and weighty Reasons, as also the Admission of the Schismatical Clergy to sit as Judges over their Bishops; the intrusion of so many <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> contrary to the Constitution of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>General Assemblies</hi>; the countenancing of a scandalous Libel against their Function and Persons; and the prejudging of their Cause in their several <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> by excluding them from having any Vote in the said <hi>Assembly,</hi> when they were not present to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose or speak any thing in their own behalf, the Archbishops and Bishops, in the name of themselves, and all which did adhere unto them, prepared their <hi>Declinator</hi> or Protestation against the said <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assembly,</hi> and all the Acts and Conclusions of it, as being void, and null in Law to all intents and purposes whatsoever. The day being come, <hi>Hamilton</hi> marcheth to the place appointed for the Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the equipage of a High-Commissioner, the Sword and Seal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried before him, the Lords of the Council, and all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of State, attending on him like a King indeed. The reading of his Commission, the putting in and rejecting of the <hi>Declinator,</hi> the chusing of <hi>Henderson</hi> to be Moderator of the Assembly, the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Members of it, and some Debates touching the Votes and Suffrages, challenged by <hi>Hamilton</hi> for such as were Assessors to him, took up all the time between their first Meeting and their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, which was by Proclamation solemnly declared on the twenty ninth of the same Month, having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For notwithstanding the said Dissolution, the Members of the said Assembly continued and kept their Session, and therein passed many Acts for the utter overthrow of the Polity and Government of the Church, the infringing of his Majesties Prerogative Royal, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Authority of Parliaments. For they not only Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the Bishops and their Adherents, but condemned the

very Function it self to be <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and utterly to be abolished out of the Church; notwithstanding that several Parliaments had confirmed the same. The like Censure they also past on the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice Book</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> with the five <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Perth</hi>; though the two first received the Stamp of Royal Authority, and the five last were confirmed in <hi>Parliament</hi> also. They condemned in one breath all the <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenents, in case of <hi>Predestination,</hi> without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Arguments on which they were built; and declared all men subject to <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and other Censures of the Church, who should refuse to yield obedience to all their unlawful Actings and Determinations, And though his Majesty by the same Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation had commanded all his faithful Subjects not to yield any obedience to their Acts and Ordinances, and bound himself in the Word of a King to defend them in it; yet those of the Assembly were resolved to maintain their Authority. For notwithstanding his Majesties late Declaration and Commands, not only the Bishops and Clergy, but also as many of the Layty as had refused to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to the Acts thereof, were deprived of their Offices and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, banished their Country, and forced to fly into <hi>England,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And yet the Covenanters did not play all parts in this Assembly, the King and his Commissioner had one part to act, which was the presenting of a Declaration, containing the sum and substance of all his Majesties gracious Condescensions, exprest in the several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations before remembred, and a Command to have it registred in the Acts and Records thereof.

<q>That such Lords and others as had Lands and Livings upon the Borders, were commanded to reside there with their Retinue; and those that had Castles there, were enjoined to Fortifie them. 2.

The like also to the Borders, requiring them to come unto the Kings Army well armed; Commissions to be made for punishing such as refused. 8. That the Sheriffs of the Counties were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Writ to make Provisions of Corn and Victuals for the Kings Army, and to cause them to be carried to the place appointed. The like Command sent to the Merchants in the Port-Towns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; and the Ships of the Subject taken to Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port such Provisions to the place assigned. 9. Several Sums of Money raised by Subsidies and Fifteens from the <hi>English</hi> Subject, and Aid of Money given and lent by the Merchant-Strangers, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Maintenance of the War. 10. That the King used to suspend the payment of his Debts for a certain time, in regard of the great occasions he had to use Money in the Wars of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

The chief Command committed to the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> who, though not biassed toward <hi>Rome,</hi> (as the <hi>Scots</hi> reported him) was known to be no friend to the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction: The Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> having been Captain of his Majesties Guard, and formerly appointed to conduct some fresh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> who formerly had seen some service in <hi>Holland,</hi> and very well understood the Art of War, <hi>Lieutenant-General</hi> of the Foot. Besides which power that marcht by Land, there were some other Forces embarqued in a considerable part of the Royal <hi>Navy,</hi> with plenty of Coin and Ammunition, which was put under the command of <hi>Hamilton</hi> (who must be of the <hi>Quorum</hi> in all busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) with order to ply about the Coasts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and thereby to surprise their Ships, and destroy their Trade, and make such further attempts to Landward, as opportunity should offer, and the nature of affairs require.</p>
                  <p>It is reported (and I have it from a very good hand) that when
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:54785:195"/>
the old Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> came to take his leave of the King, at his setting forward toward the <hi>North,</hi> he desired leave to give his Majesty three Advertisements before his going. The first was, That his Majesty would suffer none of the Scottish Nation to remain in his Army; assuring him that they would never fight against their Countrymen: but rather hazard the whole Army by their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ergiversation. The second was, that his Majesty would make a Catalogue of all his Counsellors, Officers of Houshold, and domestick Servants; and having so done, would with his Pen obliterate and expunge the <hi>Scots,</hi> beginning first with the Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> himself who had given the Counsel; conceiving (as he then declared) that no man could accuse the King of Partiality, when they found the Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> who had so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully served his Father and himself, about sixty years, should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged amongst the rest. A third was, That he must not hope to win upon them by Condescensions, or the sweetness of his disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by Acts of Grace: but that he should resolve to reduce them to their duty by such waies of Power as God had put into his hands. The Reason of which Counsel was, because he found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a sad experience of sixty years, that generally they were a people of so cross a grain, that they were gained by Punishments, and lost by Favours. But contrary to this good Counsel, his Majesty did not only permit all his own Servants of that Nation to remain about him: but suffered the Earls of <hi>Roxborough</hi> and <hi>Traquaire,</hi> and other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen of that Kingdom with their several Followers and Retinues to repair to <hi>York,</hi> under pretence of offering of some expedient to compose the differences. Where being come, they plyed their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness so well, that by representing to the Lords of the <hi>English</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the dangers they would bring themselves into by the Pride and Tyranny of the Bishops, if the <hi>Scots</hi> were totally subdued, they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated the displeasures of some, and so took off the edge of others, that they did not go from <hi>York,</hi> the same men they came thither. On the discovery of which Practice, and some intelligence which they had with the <hi>Covenanters,</hi> they were confined to their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (the first at <hi>York,</hi> the other at <hi>Newcastle</hi>) but were presently dismissed again, and sent back to <hi>Scotland.</hi> But they had first done what they came for, never men being so suddenly cooled as the Lords of <hi>England</hi>; or ever making clearer shews of an alteration in their words and gestures.</p>
                  <p>This change his Majesty soon found, or had cause to fear; and therefore for the better keeping of his Party together, he caused an Oath to be propounded to all the Lords, and others of chief Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency which attended on him, before his departure out of <hi>York</hi>; knowing full well, that those of the inferiour Orbs would be wholly governed by the motion of the higher Spheres. The Tenor of which Oath was this that followeth:
<q>
                        <pb n="386" facs="tcp:54785:196"/>
                        <hi>I A. B.</hi> do Swear before the Almighty and Ever-living God, That I will bear all faithful Allegiance to my true and undoubted Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign King <hi>CHARLES,</hi> who is Lawful King of this Island, and all other his Kingdoms and Dominions both by Sea and Land, by the Laws of God and Man, and by Lawful Succession; And that I will m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st constantly and most chearfully, even to the utmost hazard of my Life and Fortunes, oppose all Seditions, Rebellions, Conjurations, Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies whatsoever, against his Royal Dignity, Crown, and Person, raised or set up under what pretence or colour soever: And if it shall come vailed under pretence of Religion, I hold it more abominable both before God and Man. And this Oath I take voluntarily, in the Faith of a good Christian and Loyal Subject, without Equivocation or mental Reservation whatsoever; from which I hold no Power on Earth can absolve me in any part.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such was the Tenour of the Oath; which being refused by two, and but two of the Lords, of which one would not <hi>Say</hi> it, nor the other <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rock</hi> it, the said Refusers were committed to the Custody of the Sheriffs of <hi>York</hi>; and afterwards, for their further Tryal, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated upon certain Articles touching their approbation or dislike of the War: To which their Answers were so doubtful and unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory, that his Majesty thought it safer for him to dismiss them home, than to keep them longer about him to corrupt the rest: By means whereof he furnished them with an opportunity of doing him more disservice at home, where there was no body to attend and observe their Actions, than possibly they could have done in the Army, where there were so many eyes to watch them, and so many hands to pull them back if they proved extravagant.</p>
                  <p>As to the carrying on of the War, the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his Majesty, at his first coming to <hi>York,</hi> to put a Garrison into <hi>Berwick,</hi> and to take with him such Provisions of Canon, Arms, and Ammunition as were assigned for that Imployment: Which as he chearfully undertook, so he couragiously performed it, notwithstanding all the terrours and affrightments which he found in his March. For being encountred in his way with the Earls of <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, Traquaire,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Scots</hi> then going to <hi>York,</hi> they laboured all they could to disswade him from it, assuring him, That either the <hi>Scots</hi> would be in the Town before him; or that their whole Army would be so near, that he must needs run the hazard of losing all, without doing any thing. Which notwithstanding, he went on, entred the Town, repaired the Breaches in the Walls, and placed his Cannon on the same, proceeding in the Work as became a Souldier. With less fidelity and courage dealt the Earl of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> at the Kings coming near the Borders, where long he had not been encamped, when he had Intelligence that the <hi>Scots</hi> Army was advancing; on which Advertisement, he dispatch'd <hi>Holland</hi> with a
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:54785:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great Body of Horse to attend upon them. <hi>Lesly</hi> had drawn his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into a very large Front, his Files exceeding thin and shallow: but intermingled with so many Ensigns, as if every twenty or thirty men had been a Regiment; and behind all, a great Herd of Cattel, which raised up so much dust with their feet, as did cloud the Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem. <hi>Holland</hi> dismayed with such a formidable appearance, or being afraid that his great Horse would be under-ridden with the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway</hi> Nags, sent Messenger after Messenger to acquaint the King with his present condition, who sent him order to draw off and retire again, and not to hazard himself and the Forces under him, on such a <hi>visible disadvantage.</hi> How <hi>Hamilton</hi> behaved himself, we are next to see; who having anchored his Fleet in the <hi>Frith</hi> of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and landing some of his spent men in a little Island, to give them breath, and some refreshments, received a Visit from his Mother, a most rigid and pragmatical <hi>Covenanter</hi>; the <hi>Scots</hi> upon the shore saying with no small laughter, <hi>That they knew the Son of so good a Mother, could not do them hurt</hi>: And so it proved; for having loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered thereabouts to no purpose, till he heard that the Treaty of the <hi>Pacification,</hi> was begun neer <hi>Berwick,</hi> he left his Ships, and came in great haste, as it was pretended, to disturb the business, which was to be concluded before he came thither.</p>
                  <p>For so it hapned,
<q>That as soon as <hi>Essex</hi> had brought his Forces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Berwick,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> began to fear the approaching danger which they had drawn upon themselves; and thereupon some Chiefs amongst them addressed their Letters to him on the 19th. of <hi>April,</hi> laying the cause of all these Troubles to some ill Countrymen of their own,<note place="margin">

They complained also, That there were many of the <hi>English</hi> in Place and Credit, whose Private Byass did run clean contrary to the Publick Good; such as did rise early to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the Publick Fountain, and to sow the Tares of unhappy Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies and Discords between the Kingdoms, before the good Seed of our Love and Respect to the <hi>English</hi> Nation, could take place in their hearts. They declared next, how strange and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it was unto them, to see his Forces drawn toward the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which they could not but interpret as a pregnant presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of some further Project against their Nation by his Power; which must needs cause them to bestir themselves in time, for their own preservation. And though they gave themselves some assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, grounded upon the Reputation of his former Life, that his Lordship would be very wary to begin the Quarrel, at which Enemies only would rejoyce and catch advantage; yet at the last (fearing that neither Threats nor Complements would do the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness) they fall to a downright begging of a <hi>Pacification.</hi> For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

taken God to witness, That they desired no National Quarrel to arise betwixt them, or to taste any of the bitter Fruit, which might set their Childrens Teeth on edge; They professed themselves obliged in conscience to God, their Prince, Nation, and Brethren, to try all just and lawful means for the removal of all Causes of Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ut more particularly to his Lordship, in regard of his Place and Command at that time; And this to do by any means whatsoever, which should be thought expedient on both sides.</q>
But <hi>Essex,</hi> though perhaps he might like their Cause, did not love their Nation (the Affront put upon him by <hi>Carr</hi> Earl of <hi>Somerset</hi> running still in his mind); so that the Practice edified very little with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ought I can find; whatsoever it might do with others about the King, to whom the Letter was communicated, which in duty he was bound to do on the first receiving.</p>
                  <p>With greater comfort they applied themselves to the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> whom at first they feared more than all the rest: but had now placed the greatest part of their confidence on him. For whilst the <hi>Puritans</hi> in both Kingdoms stood at a gaze upon the Issue of this War, one <hi>Mosely</hi> Vicar of <hi>Newark</hi> upon <hi>Trent,</hi> obtained leave to pass through the Army into <hi>Scotland:</hi> A man of zeal enough to be put upon any business which the wiser ones durst not be seen in; and of such silliness withal, that no body could fear any danger from him. By this Man (as appears by their Letter) they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of his Lordships particular Affection to the continuance of the Common Peace betwixt the Nations, being before assured of his Noble Disposition in the general (as the Letter words it.) And this being said, they signifie unto him, and wish that they could do the like to all the good Subjects of <hi>England,</hi>
                     <q>That they were neither weary of <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government, nor had entertained the least thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s of casting of the yoke of Obedience, or invading <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; That they desired nothing else than peaceably to enjoy their Religion, and the Liberties of their Country, according to the Laws; and that all Questions about the same, might be decided by Parliament and National Assemblies, which they conceived his Lordship would judge to be most equitable, and for which no National Quarrel (as they hoped) could justly arise. And finally, That they had sent him a Copy of the Supplication, which they intended to present unto the King, as soon as he was prepared for it; to the end that by the mediation of his Lordship, and other Noble Lords of <hi>England,</hi> to whom they had written in like manner, his Majesty might be pleased to hear them at large, and grant such things as they had desired; which they conceived to tend to his Majesties great Glory, to put an end to all the present Questions to their mutual rejoycing, and to make the blessed Instruments of
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:54785:197"/>
so good a work to be thankfully remembred to Posterity.</q>
In their letter to the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> of the seventh of <hi>Iune,</hi> they express more confidence (as being more assured of him then of any other) not only justifying themselves in their former proceedings: but requesting his assistance to promote their desires in a petition ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to his Majesty hands, descending by degrees to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<q>That by a meeting in some convenient place, and of some prime and well affected men to the Reformed Religion and the Common Peace, all matters might be so well amended, and with such expedition, that their evils (through further delays) might not prove incurable.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These preparations being made, they found an easier business of it, then they had any reason to expect or hope, to bring his Majesty to meet them in the middle way; who was so tender of their case that he was more ready to accept their supplication, then they were to offer it. It was not his intent to fight them, (as I have heard from a person of great trust and honour) but only by the terrour of so great an Army to draw the <hi>Scots</hi> to do him reason. And this I am the more apt to credit, because when a Noble and well experienced Commander offered him (then being in Camp near <hi>Berwick</hi>) that with two thousand horse (which the King might very well have spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) he would so waste, and spoil their Countrey, that the <hi>Scots</hi> should creep upon their bellies to implore his mercy, he would by no means hearken to the proposition. And having no purpose of out-going <hi>Muster</hi> and <hi>Ostentation,</hi> it is no wonder if he did not only willingly give way to the presenting of their Petition, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully embraced all <hi>Overtures</hi> tending to a <hi>Pacification:</hi> but make choice also of such persons, to Negotiate in it, who were more like to take such terms as they could get, then to fight it out. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners being on both sides appointed, they came at last to this conclusion on the seventeenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> viz. First, <hi>That his Majesty should confirm whatsoever his Commissioner have already granted in his Majesties name, and that from thenceforth all matters</hi> Ecclesiastical <hi>should be determined by the Assemblies of the Kirk, and all matters</hi> Civil <hi>by the Parliament; and to that end a General Assembly to be Indicted on the sixth of</hi> August, <hi>and a Parliament on the twentieth of the same Moneth, in which Parliament an Act of Oblivion was to pass for the common peace and satisfaction of all parties; that the</hi> Scots <hi>upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the accord, should within fourty eight hours disband all their Forces, discharge all pretended Tables, and Conventicles, restore unto the King all his Castles, Forts and Ammunition of all sorts; the like Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to be made to all his good Subjects, of their Liberties, Lands, Houses, Goods, and Means whatsoever, taken and detained from them, since the late</hi> pretended General Assembly <hi>held at</hi> Glasco; <hi>that thereupon his Majesty should presently recal his Fleet, and retire his Land Forces, and cause Restitution to be made of all persons of their Ships and Goods Detained and Arrested since the first of</hi> February.

the proceedings of the Assembly of <hi>Glasco,</hi> as his Majesty could not allow them with Honour on the one side; so neither do I find that they were condemned, or that the <hi>Scots</hi> were bound to abandon the conclusions of it, so that it seems to have been left in the same condition, (as to all the Acts, Determinations, and Results there) in which it stood before his Majesties taking Arms; Which as it was the chief ground of the Quarrel, so the King doing nothing in Order to the Abrogating of it, and the conclusions therein made, when he was in the head of a powerful Army, he could not give himself much hopes, that the <hi>Scots</hi> could yield to any such Abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he had no such Army to compel obedience.</p>
                  <p>And this appeared immediately on his Majesties signing the Agreement, and the discharging of his Forces upon the same. For the Declaration of this accord was no sooner published, but the Covenanters produced a Protestation;
<q>First, of adhering to their late General Assembly at <hi>Glasco,</hi> as a full and free Assembly of their Kirk, and to all the proceedings there; especially the sentences of Deprivation, and Excommunication of the sometimes pretended Bishops of that Kingdom: And secondly, of adhering to their Solemn Covenant, and Declaration of the Assembly, whereby the office of Bishop is abjured. Thirdly, that the pretended Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops and Bishops, that usurp the title and office abjured by the Kirk and be contemners of the sentences of Kirk, have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Incendiaries of his Majesty against this Kingdom, by their wicked calamnies; and that if they return to this Kingdom, they be esteemed and used as accursed, and they delivered up to the Devil, and cast off from Christ his body, as <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> and <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans:</hi> And fourthly, that all the entertainers of the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Bishops, should be orderly proceeded against with Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, conform to the Acts, and Constitutions of this Kirk.</q>
And this they did as well to justifie their proceeding in the said <hi>Assembly,</hi> as to terrifie and affright the Bishops from presenting themselves as members of Assembly and Parliament at the next Conventions. Which done they dispersed abroad a scandalous Paper, pretending to contain the heads of the late Agreement; but drawn so advantageously for themselves, so disagreeably to the true intention of his Majesty, that he could do no less in honour then call it in, and cause it to be publickly burnt by the hand of the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And being conscious to themselves how much his Majesty, must be incensed with these Indignities, they continued their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Consultations as before they did, maintained their Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations at <hi>Leith</hi> the Port Town to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> disquieted molested, and frighted all of different inclinations, and kept their Officers and Commanders in continual pay, to have them in a Readiness on the next occasion. With which disorders his Majesty being made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, he sent for some of the Chiefs of them to come to him to <hi>Berwick</hi>: but was refused in his Commands under pretence, that
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:54785:198"/>
there was some intention to entrap them at their coming thither; and that his Majesty might be staved off from being present at the next <hi>Assembly</hi> in <hi>Edenborough,</hi> as he had both promised, and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they commit a riotous assault on the Earls of <hi>Kinnoul,</hi> and <hi>Traquaire,</hi> Chief Justice <hi>Elphinsten,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> all Privy Counsellors of that Kingdom. These they pulled violently out of their Coach, on a suspicion that some Bishops were disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed amongst them; but really that the King might have some cause to suspect that there could be no safety for him in such a place, and amongst people so enraged, notwithstanding his great clemency shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them in the <hi>Pacification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Majesty was now at leisure to repent the loss of those Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which God had put into his hands. He found the <hi>Scots</hi> so unprovided (not having above 3000. compleat Arms amongst them) that he might have scattered them like the dust before the wind at the very first onset. By making this agreement with them he put them into such a stock of Reputation, that within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of that year they furnished themselves out of <hi>Holland</hi> with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, Arms, and Ammunition upon days of Payment without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursing any money, which he knew they had not. He came unto the borders with a gallant Army, which might assure him (under God) of a very cheap and easie victory; an Army governed by Colonels, and other Officers of approved Valour, and mingled with the choicest of the <hi>English</hi> Gentry, who stood as much upon his honour as upon their own. This Army he disbanded wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Had he retired it only to a further distance, he had done as much as he was bound to by the Capitulations: But he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded it before he had seen the least performance on their parts of the points agreed on; before he had seen the issue and success of the two Conventions, in which he did expect a settling of his peace and happiness; which had he done, he had in all reasonable probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties preserved his honour in the eye of Foraign Nations, secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himself from any danger from that people, and crusht those Practices at home which afterwards undermined his Peace, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed his Glories. But doing it in this form and manner, without effecting any thing which he seemed to Arm for, he animated the <hi>Scots</hi> to commit new Insolencies, the <hi>Dutch</hi> to affront him in his own Shores, by fighting and destroying the <hi>Spanish</hi> Navy, lying under his protection, and (which was worst of all) gave no small discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the <hi>English</hi> Gentry. Who having with great charge engaged themselves in this Expedition out of hope of getting honour to the King, their Country, and themselves by their faithful service, were suddenly dismissed, not only without the honour which they aimed at, but without any acknowledgment of their Love and Loyalty. A matter so unpleasing to them, that few of them appeared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="392" facs="tcp:54785:199"/>
troubles, the greatest part looking on his Successes with a careless eye, as unconcerned in his Affairs, whether good or bad.</p>
                  <p>In this condition of Affairs he returned toward <hi>London</hi> in the end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> leaving the <hi>Scots</hi> to play their own Game as they listed; having first nominated <hi>Traquaire</hi> as his High Commissioner for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging both the Assembly, and the following Parliament. In the first meeting of the two, they acted over all the parts they had plaid at <hi>Glasco,</hi> to the utter abolition of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and the destruction of all those which adhered unto it; their Actings in it being confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his name by the High Commission. In the Parliament they altered the old form of chusing the Lords of the <hi>Articles,</hi> erected a third Estate out of <hi>Lairds</hi> and Barons, instead of the Bishops; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the Soveraign power of Coynage; Resolved upon an Act for abrogating all former Statutes concerning the Judicature of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer for making of Proxies, and governing the Estates of Wards; and finally, conceived the King to be much in their debt by yielding to a prorogation till a further time. The news whereof reduced the King to such a stand, that he was forced to send for <hi>Wentworth</hi> out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he had acted things in settling the Estate of that broken Kingdom, beyond expectation or belief. This charged on <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as a project and crime of his, and both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether branded for it in a Speech made by the Lord <hi>Faulkland,</hi> in the first year of the Long Parliament, where speaking first of the Bishops generally, he tells the Speaker,
<q>That they had both kindled and blown the fire in both Nations; and more particularly, that they had both sent and maintained that book, of which the Author hath no doubt long since wished with <hi>Nero (Vtinam nescissem Literas.)</hi> And of which more than one Kingdom hath cause to wish, that he who writ it, had rather burned a <hi>Library,</hi> though of the value of <hi>Ptolemies.</hi> And then he adds, We shall see then (saith he) who have been the first and principal cause of the breach, I will not say of, but since the <hi>Pacification</hi> at <hi>Berwick.</hi> We shall find them to have been the almost sole Abettors of my Lord of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> whilst he was practicing upon another Kingdom that manner of Government which he intended to settle in this, where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted so many, so mighty, and so manifest enormities, as the like have not been committed by any Governour in any Government since <hi>Veires</hi> left <hi>Sicily.</hi> And after they had called him over from being <hi>Deputy</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> to be in manner <hi>Deputy</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (all things here being governed by a <hi>Iuntillo,</hi> and that <hi>Iuntillo</hi> gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him) to have assisted him in the giving of such Counsels, and the pursuing of such courses, as it is a hard and measuring cast, whether they were more unwise, more unjust, or more unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and which had infallibly been our destruction, if by the grace of God their share had not been as small in the subtilty of Serpents as in the innocence of Doves.</q>
But these were only the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:54785:199"/>
Evaporations of some Discontents, which that noble Orator had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted; of which more elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wentworth</hi> being called unto this Service, was presently made Lord Leiutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not long after with great solemnity Created Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> in the County of <hi>York.</hi> As Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant he had Power to appoint a Deputy, that so he might the better attend the Service here, without any prejudice to that Kingdom; which Office he committed to <hi>Wansford</hi> a <hi>Yorkshire</hi> Gentleman, and an especial Confident of his, whom he had took along with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ireland</hi> at his first going thither. And because great Counsels are carried with most faith and secrecy, when they are entrusted but to few, his Majesty was pleased to commit the Conduct of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Businesses to a <hi>Iuncto</hi> of three; that is to say, the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the new Lord Lieutenant, and the Marquis of <hi>Hamilton</hi>; which last the other two knew not how to trust, and therefore communicated no more of their Counsels to him, than such as they cared or feared not to make known to others. By these three joyned in Consultations, it was conceived expedient to move his Majesty to try his fortune once more in calling a Parliament, and in the mean time to command some of the Principal <hi>Covenanters</hi> to attend his Pleasure at the Court, and render an account of their late Proceedings. In order to the first, they had no sooner signified what they thought fit for his Majesties Service, but it was chearfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by the Lords of the Council, who joined together with them in the Proposition; promising his Majesty to assist him in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ways, if the Parliament should fail him in it, as they after did. Upon these Terms his Majesty yielded to the Motion on the fifth of <hi>December,</hi> causing an Intimation to be publickly made of his Intent to hold a Parliament on the 13th. of <hi>April,</hi> then next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: An Intimation which the <hi>Londoners</hi> received with great signs of joy, and so did many in the Country: but such withal, as gave no small matter of disturbance unto many others, who could not think the calling of a Parliament in that point of time, to be safe or seasonable. The last Parliament being dissolved in a Rupture, the Closets of some Members searched, many of them imprisoned, and some fined; it was not to be thought but that they would come thither with revengeful Spirits. And should a breach happen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and the King, and the Parliament be Dissolved upon it, as it after was, the breach would prove irreparable, as it after did. Besides which fear, it was presumed, that the interval of four Months time, would give the discontented Party opportunity to unite themselves, to practice on the Shires and Burroughs, to elect such Members as they should recommend unto them; and finally, not only to consult, but to conclude on such Particulars as they inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> the calling a Parliament at that time, and with so long warning beforehand, was conceived unsafe: And if it was unsafe, it was mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>unseasonable.</hi> Parliaments had now long been discontinued, the People lived happily without them, and few took thought who should see the next: And which is more, the Neighbouring Kings and States beheld the King with greater Veneration, than they had done formerly, as one that could stand on his own Legs, and had raised up himself to so great Power both by Sea and Land, without such discontents and brabbles as his Parliaments gave him. So that to call a Parliament, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eared to be the likeliest way to make his Majesty seem less in estimation both at home and abroad, the eyes of men being distracted by so many objects.</p>
                  <p>But whatsoever others thought, it was thought by <hi>Wentworth,</hi> that he could manage a Parliament well enough to the Kings Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; especially by setting them such a Lesson as should make them all ashamed of not writing after such a Copy. Two ends they had in advising the Intimation of the Parliament to be given so long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sitting. First, That the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> might in the mean time hold a Parliament in that Kingdom, which he did accordingly, and governed the Affair so well, that an Army of 8000 Horse and Foot (some of our Writers say 10000) was speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raised, and Money granted by the Parliament to keep them in pay, and furnish them with Ammunition, Arms, and all other Necessaries. Secondly, That by the Reputation of a following Parliament, he might be the better enabled to borrow Money for the carrying on of that War, if the Parliament should chance to fail of doing their Duty; wherein the Lords performed their parts, in drawing in great Sums of Money upon that account. For causing a List to be made of most of the Persons of Ability, which had relation to the Courts of Judicature, either Ecclesiastical or Civil, of such as held Offices of the Crown as attained unto his Majesties Service, or otherwise were thought to be well affected to the present Cause, and had not formerly contributed toward it, they called them to the Council-Table, where they endeavoured, by the prevailing Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of Power and Favour, to perswade them to a bountiful Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, or a chearful Loan, according to the Sums proportioned and requested of them. In which they did proceed so well, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney came flowing in apace, enough to put the King into a condition of making new Levies of Men both for Horse and Foot, Listing them under their Commanders, and putting them into a Posture for the War approaching. And that they might be sure to speed the better, by the encouragement of a good Example, the Lord Lieutenant subscribed for a Loan of 20000 <hi>l.</hi> the other Lords with the same Loyalty and Affection proportioning their Engagements to their Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and thereby giving Law to most of the Noblemen in all parts of the Kingdom. Nor was the Queen wanting for her part to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Service; For knowing how great a share she had in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Fortune, she employed her Secretary <hi>Winter, Mountague, Digby,</hi> and others of her Confidents of that Religion, to negotiate
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:54785:200"/>
with the rest of their party, for being Assistant to his Majesty in so just a quarrel. In which design she found such a liberal correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> as shewed them to be somewhat ambitious of being accounted amongst the most Loyal and best af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, of his Majesties Subjects.</p>
                  <p>These preparations being Resolved on and in some part made, it was thought convenient that his Majesty should take the opportunity of the coming of some Commissioners from the <hi>Scots</hi> to call for an account of their late proceedings. According unto which advice his Majesty appointed a Select Committee from the rest of the Council, to bring those Commissioners to a reckoning, to hear what they could say for themselves and the rest of their fellows, and to make report thereof to his Majesty; The Commissioners were the Earl of <hi>Dumfermelling,</hi> the Lord <hi>London, Douglas</hi> and <hi>Barkley,</hi> both of inferiour rank, but of like Authority; Of which the Speakers part was performed by <hi>London,</hi> A confident bold man, of a Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They could shew none to qualifie them in the nature of Publick Agents; Nor had they any power to Oblige their party in the performance of any thing which might give his Majesty full satisfaction for the time to come, whatsoever satisfaction he was able to give them in debating the business. His Majesty endeavoured not by reason only, but by all fair and gentle means, to let them see the unreasonableness of their demands, the legality of their proceedings, and the danger which would fall upon them, if they continued obstinate in their former courses. But <hi>London</hi> governed all the rest, who being of a fiery na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in himself, and a dependent on the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> who had declared himself for the Covenanters at the <hi>Assembly</hi> at <hi>Glasco,</hi> resolved to stand to the Conclusion which he brought along with him, though he found himself unable to make good the Premises; so that some days being unprofitably spent in these debates, the Archbishop and the rest of the Committee, made a report of the whole business to the rest of the Council, who upon full conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all particulars, came to this Result: That since the <hi>Scots</hi> could not be reclaimed to their obedience by other means, they were to be <hi>reduced by Force.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was no more then what the <hi>Scots</hi> could give themselves
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:54785:201"/>
Reason to expect; and therefore they bestirred themselves as much on the other side. Part of the Walls of the Castle of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> with all the Ordnance upon it, had fallen down on the nineteenth of <hi>November</hi> last, being the <hi>Anniversary</hi> day of his Majesties Birth (not without some presage of that ill fortune which befel him in the course of this War) for the Repair whereof, they would neither suffer Timber, nor any other Materials to be carried to it: but on the contrary, they began to raise Works and Fortifications against it, with an intent to block it up, and render it unuseful to his Majesties Service: And to keep the Souldiers therein Garrisoned (most of them <hi>English</hi>) to hard meats, they would not suffer them to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Market to recruit their Victuals. They made Provisions of great quantity of Artillery, Munition and Arms from Foreign Parts; laid Taxes of ten Marks in the hundred upon all the Subjects, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their several Revenues, which they Levied with all cursed Rigour, though bruiting them abroad to be <hi>Free-will Offerings</hi>; scattered abroad many Seditious and Scandalous Pamphlets, for justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying themselves and seducing others, some of which were burnt in <hi>England</hi> by the hand of the Hangman; Fortified <hi>Inchgarvie</hi> and other places, which they planted with Ordnance; Imprisoned the Earl of <hi>Southesk,</hi> and other Persons of Quality, for their fidelity to the King; took to themselves the Government of the City of <hi>Edenbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> contrary to their Charters and Immunities, by which the Citizens were disabled from serving his Majesty in any of his just Commands; and finally, employed their Emissaries in all Parts of <hi>England,</hi> to disswade those who were too backward of themselves, from contributing to the War against them, and to sollicit from them such several Aids as might the better enable them to maintain the War against their Sovereign.</p>
                  <p>But their chief Correspondence was with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> In <hi>France</hi> they had made sure of Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who Governed all Affairs in that Kingdom. Following the <hi>Maxim</hi> of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> in securing the Peace of his own Country by the Wars of his Neighbours, he practised the Revolt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and put the <hi>Catalonians</hi> into Arms against their King, to the end that he might waste the fiery Spirit of the <hi>French</hi> in a War on <hi>Flanders,</hi> with the better fortune and success. But knowing that it was the Interest of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> to hold the Balance even between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>; and that his Majesty by removing the Ships of <hi>Holland,</hi> which lay before <hi>Duynkirk, Anno</hi> 1635. had hindred the <hi>French</hi> from making such a Progress by Land, as might have made them Masters of the <hi>Spanish Netherlands</hi>; he held it a chief piece of State-Craft (as indeed it was) to excite the <hi>Scots</hi> against their King, and to encourage them to stand it out unto the last, being so excited.
<q>Upon which ground he sent <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> a <hi>Scot</hi> by Birth, his Chaplain and Almoner, to assist the Confederates in advancing the business, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt all ways for exasperating the <hi>first heat</hi>; with Order not to
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:54785:201"/>
depart from them, till (things succeeding as he wished) he might return with good News:</q>
And on the same appointed one of his Secretaries to reside in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to march along with them into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to be present at all Councils of War, and direct their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.

                     <pb n="398" facs="tcp:54785:202"/>Having thus carried on the affairs of <hi>Scotland</hi> till the end of this year, we must return to our Archbishop; whom we shall find in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent on the preservation of the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> against the Practices of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Scotizing English:</hi> and no less busied in digesting an Apologie for vindicating the <hi>Liturgie</hi> commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> In reference to the last, he took order for translating the <hi>Scottish Liturgy</hi> into the Latine Tongue; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing published with the <hi>Apologie,</hi> which he had designed, it might give satisfaction to the world of his Majesty Piety, and his own great care, the Orthodoxie and simplicity of the Book it self, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness of the <hi>Scots</hi> in refusing all of it. Which Work was finished and left with him, but it went no further; the present distemper of the times, and the troubles which fell heavily on him putting an end to it in the first beginning. But the best was, that the English <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> had been published in so many Languages, and the <hi>Scottish</hi> so agreeable to the <hi>English</hi> in the Forms and Offices, that any man might judge of the one by perusing the other. The first Liturgie of King <hi>Edward</hi> vi. translated into Latine by <hi>Alexander Alesius,</hi> a learned <hi>Scot,</hi> for the better information of <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> when he first came to live amongst us; the second <hi>Liturgie</hi> of that King with Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Emendations by <hi>Walter Haddon,</hi> President of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxon.</hi> and Dean of <hi>Exeter</hi>; and his Translation recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Dr. <hi>Morket,</hi> in the times of King <hi>Iames,</hi> according to such Explications and Additions as were made by order from the King. The same translated into <hi>French,</hi> for the use of the Isle of <hi>Iersey,</hi> by the appointment of the King also; into the <hi>Spanish</hi> for the better sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of that Nation, by the prudent care of the Lord Keeper <hi>Williams</hi>; And finally, by the countenance and encouragement of this Archbishop, translated into Greek by <hi>Petley,</hi> much about this time, that so the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches might have as clear an informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>English</hi> Piety as the <hi>Western</hi> had.</p>
                  <p>In order to the other he recommended to <hi>Hall,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Exon.</hi> the writing of a book in defence of the <hi>Divine Right of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Scots</hi> and their Adherents. <hi>Exeter</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the Work, and sends him a rude draught or <hi>Skeleton</hi> of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, consisting of the two main points of his intended discourse, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the several Propositions which he intended to insist on in pursuance of it. The two main points which he was to aim at, were,
<q>First, That Episcopacy is a lawful, most ancient, holy, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine institution (as it is joyned with imparity, and superiority of Jurisdiction) and therefore where it hath through Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence obtained, cannot by any humane power be abdicated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a manifest violation of Gods Ordinance. And secondly, That the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government, however vindicated under the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious names of Christs Kingdom, and Ordinance, hath no true footing either in Scripture, or the Practice of the Church in all Ages from Christs time till the present; and that howsoever it
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:54785:202" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may be of use in some Cities or Territories, wherein Episcopal Government through iniquity of times cannot be had; yet to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude it upon a Church otherwise settled under an acknowledged <hi>Monarchy,</hi> is utterly incongruous and unjustifiable.</q>
In which two points he was to predispose some Propositions (or <hi>Postulata,</hi> as he calls them) to be the ground of his proceedings; which I shall here present in his own conceptions, that so we may the better judge of those corrections which were made upon them. The <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulata</hi> were as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>1. That Government which was of Apostolical Institution, cannot be denied to be of Divine Right. 2. Not only that Government which was directly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and enacted, but also that which was practiced and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the Apostles to the Church, must justly pass <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or an Apostolical Institution. 3. That which the Apostles by Divine Inspiration instituted, was not for the present time, but for continuance. 4. The universal Practice of the Church, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately succeeding the Apostles, is the best and surest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon the Practice of the Apostles, or upon their Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. 5. We may not entertain so irreverent an opinion of the Saints and Fathers of the Primitive Church, that they who were the immediate Successors of the Apostles, would, or durst set up a Government, either faulty, or of their own heads. 6. If they would have been so presumptuous, yet they could not have diffused an uniform form of Government through the world in so short a space. 7. The ancient Histories of the Church, and Writings of the eldest Fathers, are rather to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the report of the Primitive Form of the Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, than those of this last Age. 8. Those whom the ancient Church of God, and the holy and Orthodox Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for Hereticks, are not fit to be followed as Authors of our Opinion or Practice for Church-Government. 9. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of honourable Titles or Priviledges, makes no difference in the substance of the calling. 10. Those Scriptures wherein a new Form of Government is grounded, have need to be very clear and unquestionable, and more evident than those whereon the former rejected Politie, is raised. 11. If that Order which, they say, Christ set for the Government of the Church (which they call the Kingdom and Ordinance of Christ) be but one, and undoubted, then it would, and shall have been ere this, agreed upon against them, what, and which it is. 12. It this (which they pretend) be the Kingdom, and Ordinance of Christ, then if any Essential part of it be wanting, Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not erected in the Church. 13. Christian Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie requires no impossible or absurd thing. 14. Those Tenets which are new and unheard of in all Ages of the Church, (in many, and Essential points) are well worthy to be suspected. 16. To depart from the Practice of the Universal Church
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:54785:203"/>
of Christ (ever from the Apostles times) and to betake our selves voluntarily to a new Form, lately taken up, cannot but be odious and highly scandalous.</q>

                  <p>These first Delineations of the Pourtraicture being sent to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> in the end of <hi>October,</hi> were generally well approved of by the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan.</hi> Some lines there were which he thought to have too much <hi>shadow</hi> and <hi>umbrage,</hi> might be taken at them, if not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise qualified with a more perfect Ray of Light.

Which alterations, what they were, and his reasons for them, I shall adventure to lay down, as they come before me, that so the Reader may discern as well the clearness of his apprehension, and the excellency of his judgment in the points de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated.

                           </note>The rest of your Letter is fitter to be answered by my own hand, and so you have it. And since you are pleased so worthily and brother-like to acquaint me with the whole plot of your intended work, and to yield it up to my censure, and better advice (so you are pleased to write) I do not only thank you heartily for it: but shall in the same brotherly way, and with equal freedom put some few Animadversions, such as occur on the sudden, to your further consideration, aiming at nothing but what you do, the perfection of the work in which so much is concerned. And first, for Mr. <hi>George Graham</hi> (whom <hi>Hall</hi> had signified to have renounced his Episcopal Function) I leave you free to work upon his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and his ignorance as you please, assuring my self that you will not depart from the gravity of your self, or the cause therein. Next you say in the first head, <hi>That Episcopacy is an ancient, holy, and divine Institution.</hi> It must needs be ancient and holy, if divine. Would it not be m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>re full, went it thus? So ancient as that it is of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. Next you define Episcopacy by being joyned with imparity and superiority of Iurisdiction, but this seems short; for every <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

I draw the superiority, not from the Iurisdiction which is attributed to Bishops <hi>jure positivo,</hi> in their Audience of Ecclesiastical matters: but from that which is intrinsical and original in the power of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Again, you say in the first point; That where Episcopacy hath obtained, it cannot be abdicated without violation of Gods Ordinance. This Proposition I conceive is <hi>inter minus habentes;</hi> for never was there any Church yet, where it hath not obtained. The Christian Faith was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                           </gap>er yet planted any where, but the very first feature of a Church was
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:54785:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by, or with <hi>Episcopacy;</hi> and wheresoever now Episcopacy is not suffered to be, it is by such an Abdication, for certainly there it was <hi>à Principio.</hi> In your second head you grant that the Presbyterian government may be of use, where Episcopacy may not be had. First, I pray you consider whither this conversion be not needless here, and in it self of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous consequence: Next I conceive there is no place where Episcopacy may not be had, if there be a Church more then in Title only. Thirdly, since they challenge their Presbyterian Fiction to be Christs Kingdom and Ordinance (as your self expresseth) and cast out Episcopacy as opposite to it, we must not use any mincing terms, but unmask them plainly; nor shall I ever give way to hamper our selves for fear of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plain truth, though it be against <hi>Amsterdam</hi> or <hi>Geneva:</hi> and this must be sadly thought on.</p>
                        <p>Concerning your <hi>Postulata</hi> I shall pray you to allow me the like free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; amongst which the two first are true, but (as exprest) two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictive. For Episcopacy is not so to be asserted unto Apostolical Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to bar it from looking higher and from fetching it materially and originally in the ground and Intention of it, from Christ himself; though perhaps the Apostles formalized it. And here give me leave a little to enlarge. The adversaries of Episcopacy are not only the furious <hi>Arian</hi> Hereticks (out of which are now raised, <hi>Prynne, Bastwick,</hi> and our <hi>Scottish</hi> Masters) but some also of a milder and subtler all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>y both in the <hi>Genevian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Faction. And it will become the Church of <hi>England</hi> so to vindicate it against the furious <hi>Puritans</hi> as that we may not lay it open to be wounded by either of the other two, more cunning, and more learned adversaries. Not to the <hi>Roman</hi> faction for that will be content, it shall be <hi>Juris Divini mediati,</hi> by, far, from, and under the Pope, that so the Government of the Church may be Monarchical in him; but not <hi>Immediati,</hi> which makes the Church <hi>Aristocratical</hi> in the Bishops. This is the <hi>Italian</hi> Rock, not the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi>; for that will not deny Episcopacy to be <hi>Juris Divini,</hi> so you will take it, <hi>ut suadentis vel approbantis</hi> but not <hi>imperantis;</hi> for then they may take and leave as they will, which is that they would be at. Nay (if I much forget not) <hi>Beza</hi> himself is said to have acknowledged <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to be <hi>Juris Divini Imperantis,</hi> so you will not take it as <hi>universaliter imperantis,</hi> For then <hi>Geneva</hi> might escape: <hi>&amp; citra con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderationem durantis;</hi> for then though they had it before, yet now upon wiser thoughts they may be without it, which <hi>Scotland</hi> says now, and who will may say it after, if this be good Divinity: and then all in that time shall be <hi>Democratical.</hi> I am bold to add, because in your second <hi>Postulatum</hi> I find, that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is directly commanded: but you go not so far as to meet with this subtilty of <hi>Beza,</hi> which is the great Rock in the Lake of <hi>Geneva.</hi> In your nine <hi>Postulatum,</hi> that the Accession of Honourable Titles, or Priviledges, makes no difference in the substance of the calling, You mean the titles of Archbishops, Primates, <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> Patriarcks, &amp;c. <hi>'Tis well,</hi> And I presume you do so: But then in any case take heed you assert it so, as that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:54785:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lay not hold of it, as if the Bishops were but the Title of Honour, and the same calling with a Priest; For that they all aim at, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The eleventh <hi>Postulatum</hi> is larger, and I shall not Repeat it; because I am sure you retein a Copy of what you write to me, being the Ribbs of the work; nor shall I say more to it, then that it must be warily handled for fear of a saucy Answer, which is more ready with them a great deal then a Learned one. I presume I am pardoned already for this freedom by your submission of all to me. And now I heartily pray you to send me up, (keeping a Copy to your self against the accidents of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage) not the whole work together, but each particular head or <hi>Postulatum,</hi> as you finish it; that so we here may be the better able to consider of it, and the work come on faster.

                  <p>Such care being taken to prevent all inconveniencies which might come from <hi>Scotland,</hi> he casts his eye toward the Execution of his former Orders for Regulating the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches here in <hi>England.</hi> It had been to no purpose in him to endeavour a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity amongst the <hi>Scots,</hi> as long as such examples of separation did continue amongst the <hi>English.</hi> If the <hi>post-nati</hi> in those Churches, born and bred in <hi>England,</hi> should not be bound to repair with other of their Neighbours to their Parish Churches, it might create a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mischief then the present Scandal, and come up close at last to formal Schism. His Order had been published in all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of strangers within his Province, as before is said; but Executed more or less, as the Minister and Church-wardens stood affected to those Congregations. And therefore that the Church-wardens might more punctually proceed in doing their duty, It was thought fit that certain Articles should be framed and commended to them for their future direction. The Reformation being pursued in his own Diocess, and the Metropolitical City first, it was to be presumed, that those in other places would gladly follow the Example. Of laying taxes on those strangers in their several Parishes for repairing of, and adorning their several Parish-Churches, and providing Ornaments for the same they were in all places careful enough; because their own profit was concerned in it.
<q>And for their proceedings in the rest they were directed by these Orders to inquire of all such strangers as lived amongst them, the names of all married persons in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations as of the second descent in their several Parishes, to the end that order might be taken for decent seats for them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:54785:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to their Estates and qualities: that they should return the names and ages of those unmarried of the second descent, and whose children and servants they were; to the end that the like care might be taken of their due resort to the Church, there to be Catechised, and Communicate according to their ages: that those at sixteen years and upwards, that had not already Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated should prepare themselves to receive the blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in their Parish Church at the next Communion; and from thence forward thrice in the year afterwards as the Canons of the Church require, as they would avoid presentment to their <hi>Ordinary</hi> for their neglect therein: that such as were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Masters of Families of the first and second descent, did thenceforth every Lords day, half an hour after Evening Prayer, send all such, their Children and Servants as were under sixteen to their Parish Church, there to be Catechised according to the Orders of the Church, as they themselves upon presentment would answer the Contrary.</q>
These Articles being given in the middle of <hi>April,</hi> were Executed for the rest of the year more punctually then in any of those before. But it held not much longer then the rest of that year: The troubles which the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop fell into, in the year next following dissolving all his Orders and Injunctions of this kind, as if never made.</p>
                  <p>With equal constancy he governed his Counsels in all other particulars. Some informations had been given him of certain mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours and corruptions in <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge, of which he was the Ordinary, and immediate Visitor, in the Right of his See; and in that Right he resolves upon a Visitation both in Head, and Members. To this employment he deputes his Right Trusty Friend and Assured Servant, The <hi>Dean</hi> of the <hi>Arches</hi>; who entring on his charge in the year foregoing 1638. made this Enquiry amongst others, <hi>viz. Whither they made due Reverence (by bowing towards the Altar or Communion Table)</hi> when they <hi>came into the Chappel.</hi> And finding by a return to this enquiry, that <hi>Corbet,</hi> and <hi>Cheynel</hi> two of the Fellows, not only had neglected but refused to make any such Reverence, he tryed all fair and plausible perswasions by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and others to induce them too it. But not prevailing either way, he certified the Archbishop of his Proceedings, who thereupon caused some <hi>Injunctions</hi> to be sent to the Colledge for their future Governance,<note place="margin">

and examining the Points in difference between <hi>Brent</hi> the Warden, and such of the Fellows of the Colledge as complained against him: But for determining the Cause (<hi>the Warden appearing very foul,</hi> as himself acknowledgeth) he took time till the first of <hi>Iuly</hi> in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent year, that <hi>Brent</hi> might have the better opportunities to content his Fellows, for the Errors of his Government in the times prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and give them some assurance of a Reformation for the time to come. Which noble Favour notwithstanding, and that he went off with no other Censure than a fair and Fatherly <hi>Admonition</hi>: yet <hi>Brent</hi> unmindful of so great a moderation toward him, expres'd more readiness in contributing towards his Condemnation in the time of his Trial, than any of those who did most eagerly desire his Ruine.</p>

But finding the Owners of those Houses not so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with them, as he had probably presumed, he was fain to shift the Scene, though he held his purpose, which fell out very happily for that University: For being resolved to free St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church from those Inconveniencies, which the continual keeping of the Publick Convocations and Congregations must of necessity car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with it, he erected a stately and most elegant Pile at the West end of the Divinity School, and Publick Library; The lower part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was fitted and accommodated for the Convocations, and other Publick Meetings of that Famous Body: The upper part, opening into the <hi>Bodleian Library,</hi> he trimmed with all the Curiosities of Art and Cost, to serve as a Repository for such Learned Writings, as the Piety of ensuing Times might confer upon it.

Some other great Designs he had, but of a far more Publick and Heroick Nature; as the encreasing of the Maintenance of all the poor Vicars in <hi>England</hi>; To see the Tythes of <hi>London</hi> settled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Clergy and the City; For setting up a <hi>Greek</hi> Press at <hi>Oxon.</hi> and procuring Letters and Mattrices for the same, wherewith to Print and Publish all such <hi>Greek</hi> Manuscripts as were to be found in that Library; For obtaining the like Grant from his Majesty for buying in all Impropriations, as had been made for the Repairing of St. <hi>Pauls</hi>: but not to take beginning, till that Work was finished; For procuring an <hi>Extract</hi> of all the <hi>Records</hi> of the <hi>Tower</hi> relating to the Church and Clergy, to be written in a fair Vellom Book, which had been drawn down from the 20th. of <hi>Edward</hi> 1. to the 14th. of <hi>Edward</hi> iv. with an intent to carry on the Work till the last year of King <hi>Henry</hi> viii. that so the Church might understand her own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Priviledges. But the prosecution of this Work from the said 14th. of King <hi>Edward</hi> iv. and of all the rest before-mentioned, which he had hammered in design, were most unfortunately intermitted, by the great alteration of Affairs which soon after followed. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether Posterity will believe or not, That so many great and notable Projectments could be comprehended in one Soul; most of them Ripened in a manner, the residue in the Bud or Blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, and some of them bringing forth the Fruits expected from them. But the best is, that none of his Designs were carried in so close a manner, or left in so imperfect a condition, as not to give some visible Remembrances, as well of his Universal Comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as his Zeal and Piety.</p>
                  <p>For notwithstanding the present Distractions which the Faction and Tumultuousness of the <hi>Scots,</hi> had drawn upon him (enough to have deterred a right <hi>Constantine</hi>) let us look on him in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of his former purposes, and we shall find him still the same. The Bishop of <hi>Exeter</hi>'s Book being finished, and recommended by the Author to his last perusal before it went unto the Press, he took the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:54785:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pains to read it over with care and diligence; in the perusal where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he took notice, amongst other things, that the strict Superstition of the <hi>Sabbatarians</hi> was but lightly touch'd at; whereas he thought, that some smarter Plaister to that Sore, might have done no harm. He observed also, that he had passed by this Point, <hi>viz. Whether</hi> Episcopacy <hi>be an Order or Degree,</hi> as not much material; whereas in the Judgment of such Learned Men as he had consulted, it was the main ground of the whole Cause: And therefore he desired him to weigh it well, and to alter it with his own Pen as soon as might be. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Concerning which, he writes thus to the Bishop in his Letter of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 14. this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent year, <hi>viz. The last (with which I durst not but acquaint his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty) is about</hi> Antichrist, <hi>which Title in three or four places you bestow up is the</hi> Pope <hi>positively and determinately; whereas King</hi> James <hi>of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lessed Memory, having brought strong proof in a Work of his, as you well know, to prove the Pope to be</hi> Antichrist: <hi>yet being afterwards challenged about it, he made this Answer, when the King that now is went into</hi> Spain, <hi>and acquainted him with it</hi>; That he writ, that not <hi>concludingly,</hi> but by way of <hi>Argument</hi> only: <hi>that the</hi> Pope <hi>and his Adherents might see, there was as good and better Arguments to prove him</hi> Antichrist, <hi>than for the</hi> Pope <hi>to challenge Temporal Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over Kings. The whole Passage being known to me, I could not but speak with the King about it, who commanded me to write unto you, that you might qualifie your Expression in these Particulars, and so not differ from the known Iudgment of his Pious and Learned Father. This is easily done with your own Pen; and the rather, because all</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants <hi>joyn not in this Opinion of</hi> Antichrist. According to which good advice, the Bishop of <hi>Exon.</hi> qualified some of his Expressions, and deleted other, to the Contentment of his Sovereign, the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and his own great Honour.</p>
                  <p>But whilest the Archbishop laboured to support <hi>Episcopacy</hi> on the one side, some of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Party did as much endeavour to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it, by lopping off the Branches first, and afterwards by laying the Ax to the root of the Tree. <hi>Bagshaw</hi> a Lawyer of some standing of the Middle Temple, did first prepare the way to the ruine of it, by questioning the Bishops Place and Vote in Parliament, their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Power, and the Authority of the <hi>High-Commission.</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chosen <hi>Reader</hi> by that House for the <hi>Lent</hi> Vacation, he first began his <hi>Readings</hi> on <hi>February</hi> 24. selecting for the Argument of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursings the Statute 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. In prosecuting whereof, he had distributed his Conceptions into ten Parts, and each Part into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="6 letters">
                        <desc>••••••</desc>
                     </gap>cial Cases; by which account he must have had one hundred
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:54785:206"/>
blows at the Church in his ten days Reading. His main Design was in the first place, intended chiefly for the defence of such Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as formerly had been granted by the Courts in <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> to stop the Proceedings of the <hi>Court Christian,</hi> and specially of the <hi>High-Commission</hi>; and in the next place, to deny the Authority of the Commission it self, as before was noted. In order whereunto, he began first to state these Questions, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Whether it be a good Act of Parliament without the Assent of the Lords Spiritual?</hi> which he he held affirmatively. 2. <hi>Whether any Beneficed Clerk were capable of Temporal Iurisdiction at the time of making that Law?</hi> which he held in the negative. And 3. <hi>Whether a Bishop, without calling a Synod, have Power as</hi> Diocesan <hi>to convict an</hi> Heretick? which he maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the negative also. The News whereof being brought to <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> there was no need of warning the Archbishop to look about him, who was not to be told what a strong Faction some of the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing Lawyers</hi> had made against the Church in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Time, carried it on under the Government of King <hi>Iames,</hi> and now began to threaten as much danger to it as in former times. He thereupon informs his Majesty both of the Man and his Design, and how far he had gone in justifying the Proceedings of the <hi>Scottish Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters,</hi> in decrying the Temporal Power of Church-men, and the undoubted Right of Bishops to their Place in Parliament. His Majesty hereupon gives Order to <hi>Finch</hi> the new Lord Keeper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict all further Reading on those Points, or any others of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which might administer any further Flame to the present Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustions. The Lord Keeper having done his part, and the Reader addressing himself to him, that by his leave he might proceed in the course of his Exercise, it was soon found, that nothing could be done therein without leave from the King; and no such leave to be obtained, but by the Approbation and Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ent of the Lord Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. To <hi>Lambeth</hi> therefore goes the <hi>Reader,</hi> where he found no admittance till the making of his third Address, and was then told, <hi>That he was fallen upon a Subject neither safe nor seasonable, which should stick closer to him than he was aware of. Bagshaw</hi> endeavoured something in his own defence, as to the choice of the Argument; and somewhat also, as to the impossibility of settling to any other Subject in the present Conjuncture, desiring his Grace to be a means unto the King, that he might proceed in performance of the Task he had undertaken. To which the Archbishop stoutly answered, <hi>That his Majesty was otherwise resolved in it; and that perhaps it had been better for the Reader himself to have given over at the first, than have incurred his Majesties Royal Indignation by that unseasonable Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> No better Answer being given him, away goes <hi>Bagshaw</hi> out of Town, accompanied with forty or fifty Horse (and it was a great Honour to the House that he had no more) who seemed to be of the same Faction and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:54785:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>
care of their Courts and Profit, as the Archbishops had of the Churches power. Such was the constancy of his spirit, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Combustions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the ill prosecuting of the last Summers Action, and the uncertainties of what might happen in the next, he alwaies steered his course with a steady hand to the port he aimed at, though it pleased God to let him suffer shipwrack in the mouth of the Haven.</p>
                  <p>The interrupting of this man in the course of his Reading, the holding of so strict an hand over the Congregations of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> within his Province, and these compliances on the other side with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were made occasions of the clamour, which was raised against him concerning his design to suppress the Gospel, and to bring in <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arminianism</hi>; or at the least to make a Reconciliation betwixt us and <hi>Rome,</hi> towards which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Arminius</hi> was given out for a certain Preamble. Which general clamour being raised against him and the rest of the Bishops, I find thus flourisht over by one of their Orators in the House of Commons.<note place="margin">

                     <q>A little search (saith he) will find them to have been the destruction of Unity under pretence of Uniformity; To have brought in Superstition and Scandal under titles of Reverence and Decency; To have defiled our Church by adorning our Churches; To have slackned the strictness of that Union which was formerly between us and those of our Religion beyond the Seas, An action as unpolitick as ungodly: Or we shall find them to have resembled the Dog in the Manger, to have neither preached themselves, nor imployed those that should, nor suffered those that would; To have brought in Catechising only to thrust out Preaching, and cried down Lectures by the name of Factions, either because their industry in that duty appeared a reproof to their neglect of it, or with intention to have brought in darkness, that they might the easier sow their tares while it was night: and by that intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of ignorance, introduce the better that Religion which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it the Mother of Devotion. In which (saith he) they have abused his Majesty, as well as his People; for when he had with great wisdom silenced on both parts those opinions which have often tormented the Church, and have, and always will trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Schools, They made use of this Declaration to tye up one side, and to let the other loose, whereas they ought either in discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have been equally restrained, or in justice to have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually tolerated. And it is observable, that the party to which they gave this Licence, was that, whose Doctrine, though it was not contrary to Law, was contrary to Custome, and for a long while in this Kingdom was no oftner Preached than Recanted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We find them introducing such Doctrines, as admitting them to be true, the truth could not recompence the scandal; Or such as were so far false, as Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> saies of the <hi>Casuists,</hi> their business was not to keep men from sinning, but to inform them,

                        <hi>Quam prope ad peccatum, sine peccato liceat accedere.</hi> So it seemed their work was to try how much of a <hi>Papist</hi> might be brought in without <hi>Popery,</hi> and to destroy as much of the Gospel without bringing themselves into danger of being destroyed by Law. To go yet further, some of them have so industriously laboured to deduce themselves from <hi>Rome,</hi> that they have given great suspicion that in gratitude they desire to return thither, or at least to meet it half way; some have evidently laboured to bring in an <hi>English,</hi> though not a <hi>Roman</hi> Popery. I mean not only the outside and dress of it, but equally absolute, a blind dependance on the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the Clergy, and of the Clergy upon themselves; and have opposed the <hi>Papacy</hi> beyond the Seas, that they might settle one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the water.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such being the general charge which was laid against him, we will consider in this place what may be said in order to his defence, as to some seeming <hi>Innovations</hi> into the Worship of God, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to bring in Popery by the back-door of <hi>Arminianism,</hi> and his endeavouring of a Reconciliation betwixt us and <hi>Rome.</hi> And first, as touching such <hi>Innovations</hi> in the Worship of God, he makes a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral purgation of himself in his Speech made in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> the sum and substance whereof you have seen before. Out of which I shall only take this short and pithy Declaration which he makes of himself,<note place="margin">p. 4.</note> in relation to this part of his charge. <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>I can say it clearly and truly, as in the presence of God, that I have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as a Prelate, to the utmost of what I am conscious, but with a single heart, and with a sincere intention for the good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and honour of the Church, and the maintenance of the Orthodox truth, and Religion of Christ, professed, established, and maintained in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For my care of this Church, the reducing it to Order, the upholding of the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Worship of God in it, and the settling of the Rules of its first Reformation, are the cause (and the sole cause, whatsoever is pretended) of this malicious storm that hath lowred so black upon me, and some of my Brethren.</q>
The like Declaration he also makes in his first Speech to the Lords, at the time of his tryal, where we find it thus:
<q>Ever since I came into place (saith he) I have laboured nothing more than that the External Worship of God (so much slighted in divers parts of this Kingdom) might be preserved; and that with as much Decency and Uniformity as might be; For I evidently saw, that the publick neglect of Gods Service in the outward face of it, and the nasty lying of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places dedicated to that Service, had almost cast a damp upon the true and inward Worship of God, which while we live in the body needs External helps, and all little enough to keep it in any vigour. And this I did to the utmost of my knowledge accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both to Law and Canon, and with the consent and liking of the People; nor did any Command issue out from me against the

                     <q>That finding the Kings Judgment to depend much on the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> his faithful Servant, he resolved to move every stone, and bend all his strength to gain him to his side: being confident he had prepared, the means. For he had a command to make offer of a Cardinals Cap to the Lord Archbishop in the name of the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>; and that he should allure him also with higher promises, that he might corrupt his sincere mind; yet a fitting occasion was never offered whereby he might insinuate himself into the Lord Archbishop, to whom free access was to be impetrated by the <hi>Earl</hi> and <hi>Countess</hi> of <hi>Arundel,</hi> as also by Secretary <hi>Windebank,</hi> all whose intercessions he neglected, and did shun (as it were the Plague) the company or Familiarity of <hi>Con.</hi> He was also sollicited by others of no mean Rank, well known to him, and yet he continued unmovable.</q>
And whereas some found a way to help at last by making <hi>Windebank</hi> the <hi>Internuncio</hi> betwixt him and them, that only serves to make the matter rather worse than better, there being a great strangeness grown betwixt him and <hi>Windebank</hi>; not only before <hi>Con</hi>'s coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Realm: but before <hi>Panzani</hi> had settled any course of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the Court of <hi>England.</hi>

<q>As to a <hi>Reconciliation</hi> (saith he) between the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> there were made some gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Propositions and overtures by the Archbishops Agents, they assuring that his Grace was very much disposed thereunto; and that if it was not accomplisht in his life time, it would prove a work of more difficulty after his death; that in very truth for the last three years, the Archbishop had introduced some <hi>Innovations</hi> approaching <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>And so far had the Pope consented that whatsoever did concern the King therein, should have been really performed, so far forth as other Catholick Princes usually enjoy, and expect as their due; and so far as the Bishops were to be Independent both from King and Pope: there was no fear of breach on the Popes part.</q>
So that upon the point the Pope was to content himself amongst us in <hi>England</hi> with a <hi>Priority</hi> instead of a <hi>Superiority</hi> over other Bishops, and with a <hi>Primacy</hi> in stead of a <hi>Supremacy</hi> in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though the Author adds not long after, that it was to be suspected, <hi>That so far as the inferiour Clergy, and the people were concerned, the after-performance was to be le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to obtain a Reconciliation upon these Advantages the Archbishop had all the Reason in the world to do as he did, in ordering the Lords Table to be placed where the Altar stood, and making the accustomed Reverence in all approaches towards it, and accesses to it; in beautifying and adorning Churches, and celebrating the Divine Service with all due Solemnities; in taking care that all offensive and exasperating passages should be expunged out of such Books as were brought to the Press; and for reducing the extravagancy of some opinions to an evener temper. His Majesty had the like Reason also for tolerating Lawful Recreations on the Sundays and Holy-days, The rigorous Restraint whereof made some Papists think (those most especially of the vulgar sort, whom it most concerned) that all honest Pastime were incompetible with our Religion. And if he approved <hi>Auricular Confession,</hi> and shewed himself willing to introduce it into the use of the Church, as both our Authors say he did; it is no more then what the Liturgy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to the care of the <hi>Penitent</hi> (though we find not the word <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular</hi> in it) or what the Canons have provided for in the point of security, for such as shall be willing to confess themselves: But whereas we are told by one of our Authors,<note place="margin">

For remedy whereof he was resolved to make use of a friend in the House of Commons for offering this motion to the rest, <hi>viz.</hi> That a certain number of that House would joyn in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with as many of the Clergy assembled in Convocation, touching all doubts and differences which might happen to arise amongst them in matters which concerned the Church. And this he did upon this reason, that if the motion were accepted, the Committee for the Clergie in Convocation, might give satisfaction to that of the House of Commons in all such matters Doctrinal, or points of Ceremony which should come before them: But if the motion were rejected, he should then get the start in point of Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation amongst knowing men; the refusing of so fair an offer, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring witness for him that their Proceedings were directed rather by power and interest, than by truth and reason. But the short life of this Parliament made that Counsel useless. For the Commons doing nothing which the King desired, and the King desiring nothing more, than that they would speedily resolve one way or other, the Lords agreed upon a Vote for desiring a Conference with the Commons, the better to dispose them to this point, that his Majesties supply should have precedency of the Subjects Grievances. This voted by the Commons for a breach of their Priviledges, and the <hi>Peers</hi> censured for it, as having been transported beyond their bounds. To calm which heat his Majesty made offer for twelve Subsidies, to relinquish all his right to the Naval aide, of late called <hi>Ship-money,</hi> which had been anciently enjoyed by his Predecessors: But the Proposition, though it came but to three years purchase, would not down amongst them. At last they came unto a resolution of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing somewhat toward his Majesties supply; but in the grant thereof, blasted his Majesties Expedition against the <hi>Scots,</hi> whose Cause they resolved to make their own, and received thanks from them for that favour in their next Remonstrance. Which coming to his Majesties ears on <hi>Munday</hi> the fourth of <hi>May,</hi> he called his Council toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the next Morning betimes, by whose unanimous consent he dissolved the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Tuesday, April</hi> 14, the Convocation assembled in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-house of the Church of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> from whence they waited on his Grace and the rest of the Bishops, to hear the Sermon in the Quire. The Sermon preacht by <hi>Turner, Residentiary</hi> of the Church. His Text was taken out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Behold I send you forth as Sheep in the midst of Wolves,</hi> which he followed home unto the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. In the close of the Sermon he had a passage in these words, or to this effect, that all the Bishops held not the Reins of Church Discipline with an even hand, but that some of them were too easie
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:54785:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and remiss in the ordering thereof. Whereby though they sought to gain to themselves the popular plause of meekness and mildness, they occasionally cast on other Bishops (more severe than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) the unjust imputation of Rigour and Tyranny; and therefore he advised them withall with equal strictness to urge an universal Conformity. The Sermon ended, the Clergy fell to the electing of their <hi>Prolocutor</hi> (as before commanded) pitching unanimously on Dr. <hi>Richard Steward</hi> Clerk of his Majesties Closet, and Dean of <hi>Chichester</hi> to be presented the next day to the Archbishop and the rest of the Prelates in the Chappel of King <hi>Henry</hi> vii. at <hi>Westminster,</hi> to which the Synod was adjourned. The next day being come (after a Protestation made in writing by the Sub-Dean and Prebendaries of that Church for not acknowledging the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or the rest of the Bishops, to have any Jurisdiction in that place, and the admitting of the same for good and valid) they were permitted to proceed in their Convocation. The business of that day was the presenting of the Prolocutor by <hi>Sheldon,</hi> Warden of All-souls, his Admission by the Archbishop, and <hi>Stewards</hi> unwilling readiness to discharge the Office; each of them delivering their conceptions in Elegant Latine Speeches, as the custome is, but the Archbishops longer than both the rest. Which Ceremonies being performed, his Grace produced a Commission under the Great Seal, by which they were enabled (according to the said Statute of King <hi>Henry</hi> viii.) to propose, treat, consult, and agree upon the Exposition or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of any Canon then in force, and upon such new Canons, Orders, and Constitutions, as the said Bishops and Clergy (of which the Lord Archbishop to be alwaies one) should think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>He had been given to understand, that many of his Subjects being mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against the Rites and Ceremonies then used in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> had taken offence at the same upon an unjust supposal, That they were not only contrary to Law, but also introductive unto <hi>Popish Superstitions</hi>; whereas it well appeared unto him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mature deliberation, that the said <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which were then so much quarrelled at, were not only approved of, and used by those godly and learned Divines to whom, at the time of the Reformation under King <hi>Edward</hi> vi. the compiling of the Book of Common-Prayer was committed (divers of which suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Martyrdom in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies) but also again taken up by this whole Church under Queen <hi>Elizabeth. Which Rites so taken up, had been so duly and ordinarily practiced for a great part of her Reign (within the memory of divers living) as that it could not then be imagined, that there would need any</hi> Rule <hi>or</hi> Law <hi>for the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the same, nor that they could be thought to savour of Popery.</hi> He found too plainly, that since those times, for want of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Rule therein, and by the subtle practices of some men, the said <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> began to fall into disuse; and in place thereof other Foreign and unfitting usages by little and little to creep in: But being he found withal that in the <hi>Royal</hi> Chappels, and in many other Churches most of them had been ever constantly used and observed, his Majesty could not but be very sensible of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience. And he had cause also to conceive, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and Fomenters of those Jealousies; though they coloured the same with a pretence of zeal, and did seem to strike only at some supposed iniquity in the said <hi>Ceremonies</hi>: yet aimed at his Royal Person, and would have his good Subjects think, that he himself was perverted, and did worship God in a superstitious way, and that he did intend to bring in some alteration in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion here established. From which how far he was, and how ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly he detested the very thought thereof, he had by his many Declarations,<note place="margin">p. 294.</note> and upon sundry other occasions, given such assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the World, that no man of wisdom and discretion could ever be so beguiled as to give any serious entertainment to such brainsick Jealousies. And as for the weaker sort, who were prone to be misled by crafty seducers, he alwaies assured himself, that as many of them as had loyal, or but charitable hearts, would from thenceforth utterly banish all such causeless fears and surmises up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those his Sacred Professions so often made, as a <hi>Defender</hi> of the Christian <hi>Faith,</hi> their King and Sovereign. He perceived in the

next place, That the Ring-leaders of many well-minded people, did make the more advantage (for the nourishing of such distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers amongst them) because the aforesaid <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> or some of them, were now insisted upon but only in some Diocesses, and were not generally received in all places, nor constantly nor uniformly practiced throughout all the Churches in the Kingdom; and thereupon have been liable to be quarrelled and opposed by them who use them not.

But the first thing in which they acted by this Commission, was the tendring of a <hi>Canon</hi> to them by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury, For suppressing the further growth of Popery, and reducing Papists to the Church</hi>; with Order to the Prolocutor and inferiour Clergy, to enlarge and perfect it as to them seemed most conducible to the end desired: But afterward considering how much it might redound to his estimation, that the said <hi>Canon</hi> should proceed intirely from himself alone, he recalled the Paper into his own hands; and after some time of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, returned it back unto the Clergy in the very same words in which it passed.</p>

                  <p>So far the Bishops and Clergy had proceeded in the Work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to them, when the Parliament was most unhappily Dissolved: And possibly the <hi>Convocation</hi> had expired the next day also, according to the usual custom, if one of the Clergy had not made the Archbishop acquainted with a Precedent in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> Time, for the granting a Subsidy or Benevolence by <hi>Convocation,</hi> to be Taxed and Levied by <hi>Synodical Acts</hi> and <hi>Constitutions,</hi> without help of the Parliament; directing to the Records of <hi>Convocation</hi> where it was to be found. Whereupon the <hi>Convocation</hi> was Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed from <hi>Wednesday,</hi> till the <hi>Friday</hi> following, and then till the next day after, and so till <hi>Munday,</hi> to the great amazement of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Members of it, who expected to have been Dissolved when the Parliament was, according to that clause in the <hi>Commission</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, by which it was restrained to the Time of the Parliament on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Much pains was taken by some of the Company, who had been studied in the Records of <hi>Convocation,</hi> in shewing the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Writ for calling a Parliament, and that for assembling a <hi>Convocation</hi>; their different Forms, and the independence of the one upon the other: but more especially betwixt the Writ by which they were made a <hi>Convocation,</hi> and that <hi>Commission</hi> by which they were enabled to the making of <hi>Canons</hi>; That though the <hi>Commission</hi> was expired with the Parliament, yet the Writ continued still in force; and by that Writ they were to remain a <hi>Convocation,</hi> until they were Dissolved by another. With which Distinction, the greatest part of those who before had scrupled at their Sitting, did appear well satisfied; but better satisfied on the <hi>Munday,</hi> by a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which was sent unto them from the Court.

Incouraged with which assurance, and Animated by a New Commission to remain in Force during the Pleasure of the King, they settled to their work again on Wednesday the thirteenth of that Moneth, but not without some trouble of mind in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Apparent Danger which seemed to threaten them. The Archbishops house at <hi>Lambeth</hi> had been assaulted on Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day by a Rabble of <hi>Anabaptists, Brownists,</hi> and other Sectaries, to the Number of five hundred and upwards, who seeing they could not force that house resolved to turn their fury on the <hi>Convocation.</hi> Of which his Majesty being Informed, he caused a guard to be set about them consisting of some Companies of the trained Bands of the County of <hi>Middlesex</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Endymion Porter,</hi> one of the Grooms of the <hi>Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>; an honest man, and of good affections to the Church and his Majesties Service.

For as it is the duty of Subjects to supply their King; so is it part of the Kingly office to support his Subjects, in the Propriety and Freedom of their Estates.</hi>

which was sent with the Propositions, required them to be read distinctly and audibly by every Parson, Vicar, Curate, or Preacher upon some one Sunday in every Quarter of the year at Morning Prayer.

                     </gap> it came from the Lords, it was expressed in these words, that every man should Swear to the <hi>Doctrine and Discipline established in Church of</hi> England. And this occasioned some dispute, concerning the extent of the word Discipline, whither it comprehended the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Government, and the publick Forms of Divine Worship; or was to be restrained only to the use of the Keys, as it was practiced in Ecclesiastical Courts. Some would have had the words run thus, I. A. B. <hi>do swear that I approve the Doctrines, Discipline or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment established,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>These two great matters being thus concluded, A message is delivered by the Prolocutor from the house of Bishops, by which the Clergy were desired to consider of the best expedient for indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing an Uniformity in the Church about the situation of the Lords Table, the Receiving of the blessed Sacrament, and the due Revenue to be used in the house of God, and to prepare a Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

that it might pass or be rejected as the House thought fit. The Committee consisted of 27. the Prolocutor being reckoned into the number, their meeting to be held the same afternoon in the Chappel of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. Where being met, and sitting about the table provided for the use of the Bishops, the points were seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously debated, every man speaking his opinion in them when it came to his turn without interruption; beginning with the Prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, and so proceeding from man to man till it concluded with the Clerk for the Church of <hi>Westminster</hi>; So placed of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that he might answer all such arguments, as had been brought against any of the points proposed, and were not answered to his hand. The Prolocutor having taken the summe of every mans Judgement, declared that the far Major part had appeared for placing the Lords Table where the Altar stood, the drawing neer unto it to receive the Sacrament, and the making of due Reverences at the entring into the Church and going out of it; and thereupon put it to the question, whether they thought it convenient that a Canon should be prepared to that purpose or not? Which being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the affirmative, without any visible dissent, one of the Clerks for the Diocess of <hi>Bristol</hi> presented a Canon ready drawn for the same effect, but drawn in such a commanding, and imperious Style, that it was disliked by all the company but himself; and thereupon a Sub-committeee was appointed to prepare the Canon, and make it ready with as much dispatch as they could conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently. Which was no sooner agreed on, and the Committee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for some following business; but the Archdeacon of <hi>Huntington</hi> who was one of the number, made his first appearance, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly discontented that he was not stayed for, and that the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was concluded before he came, and earnestly pressing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutor, that the debate might be Resumed, or at the least his Reasons might be heard against the Vote: which when the Prolocutor upon very good Reasons had refused to yield too, he fell upon him with such heats, and used him so exceeding coursly; that on complaint made thereof and of some other intervening harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, made by the Prolocutor in a full House of the Clergy, he was ordered by the far Major part to quit the House, though afterwards Restored again on the acknowledgment of his Errour, when his heats were down. Which Rubb removed, the Canon went very smoothly on without opposition, commended Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally for the Modesty and Temper of it; in which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect I hold it worthy to be presented to the Reader in its full proportion, without any Abbreviation of it as of those before.</p>

And therefore We judge it fit and convenient that all Churches and Chappels do conform themselves in this particular to the example of the Cathedral or mother Churches, saving alwaies the general liberty left to the Bishop by Law during the time of the Administration of the holy Communion. And We declare, that this Situation of the holy Table, doth not imply that it is or ought to be esteemed a true and proper Altar, whereon Christ is again really sacrificed: But it is and may be called an Altar by us, in that sense which the Primitive Church called it an Altar, and no other.</p>
                              <p>And because experience hath shewed us, how irreverent the behaviour of many people is in many places, some leaning, other casting their hats, and some sitting upon, some standing at, and others sitting under the Communion Table in time of Divine Service: For the avoiding of these and the like abuses, it is thought meet and convenient by this present <hi>Synod,</hi> that the said Communion Table in all Churches or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels be decently severed with Rails to preserve them from such or worse prophanations.</p>

                              <p>And lastly, whereas the Church is the House of God, dedicated to his holy Worship, and therefore ought to mind us both of the greatness and goodness of his divine Majesty; certain it is, that the acknowledgment thereof, not only inwardly in our hearts, but also outwardly with our bodies, must needs be pious in it self, profitable unto us, and edifying unto others. We therefore think it very meet and behoveful, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily commend it to all good and well-affected people, Members of this Church, that they be ready to tender unto the Lord the said acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by doing reverence and obeysance both at their coming in and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the said Churches, Chancels, or Chappels, according to the most ancient custome of the Primitive Church in the purest times, and of this Church also for many years of the Reign of Queen <hi>Eliza<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By means whereof the people were much disturbed, the Rules of the Church contemned for their multiplicity, unknown by reason of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, and despised for the inconstancy of them that made them. Of all which he desired the Convocation to provide a remedy, by setting out one Uniform Book of Articles to be the standing Rule o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="437" facs="tcp:54785:221" rendition="simple:additions"/>
said Book of Articles, and to present it to the House with conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent speed. Which notwithstanding, there wanted not some secret practices to illude the motion, and frustrate the design, approved of by the general Vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e. Some who observed the moderation of the Articles which had been drawn for the Metropolitical Visitation, and finding them to leave a greater liberty about placing the Communion Table, and the order of officiating the Divine Service, than the new Articles might allow of, addrest themselves unto his Grace, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that those Articles might be commended to the Convocation, to be a standing Rule for all Visitations in the times succeeding; which Proposition was thought to relish well enough with him at the first proposal, though afterwards on further consideration he suffered the business to proceed in the former course. It was not long before another Canon was tendred to the Prolocutor for advancing a more general Conformity than that which was contained in the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And it was tendred by the same hand which had before presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that against <hi>Sectaries</hi>; in reference to whom it passed without opposition or alteration.<note place="margin">

                     <q>It was enjoyned by that Canon under pain of suspension, that all Preachers, as well beneficed men as others, should positively and plainly preach and instruct the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their publick Sermons that the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in the Church of <hi>England</hi> were lawful and commendable; and that the People ought not only to conform themselves to those <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> but chearfully to submit themselves unto the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, as it was then established under his Majesty.</q>
Another was brought in, but by whom I know not,

That all Clergy men in this Church, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before their eyes the glory of God, the holiness of their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the edification of the People committed to them, should carefully avoid all excess and disorders, that by their Christian and Religious Conversation they might shine forth, as lights unto others, in all godliness and honesty; and that all those to whom the Government of the Church was committed should set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to countenance and encourage Godliness, Gravity, Sobriety, and all unblameable Conversation in the Ministers of it; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently labour, by the due execution of the Canons aforesaid, and all other Ecclesiastical Provisions made for that end, to reform all offensive and scandalous persons which were in the Ministry.</q>
Which Canon was so well approved of, that it past without any stop or resistance.</p>
                  <p>All matters going thus calmly on, the Clergy began to take into consideration the great exces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es, and abuses, which were complained of in many Offices of Ecclesiastical Courts. They found the Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitancies of the Chancellors to be grown so great, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the lower Clergy, and thought themselves independent of
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:54785:222" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Bishops under whom they served. They found that many abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses had been committed in the Sentences of Excommunication and Absolution, (the slovenly executing whereof had been very offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive) as also in Commutations of Penance, and conniving at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Marriages, out of which some Officers in those Courts rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed no small advantage; Complaint was also made of some oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which had been laid upon the Subject, by concurrent Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons partly, and partly by vexatious Citations, in which nothing was more aimed at, than the Officers Fees which must be paid, though nothing could be proved against the Party when he came before them. The consideration and redress of all which grievances being referred to the Committee of twenty six, the said Committee was desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Prolocutor to hold their meetings in his house, situate under the North-side of the Abbey-Church, and therefore most convenient both for himself and them. The Grievances were great, and yet not greater than the Clamour which was raised about them, which made the Committee very intent upon the stilling of the noise; by providing better for themselves, their Brethren, and the rest of the Subjects: but not without all due respect to the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors in that honourable Faculty of the <hi>Civil Laws. Lamb</hi> Dean of the Arches, and <hi>Heath</hi> Judge of the Audience, being both Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Convocation, were taken into that Committee; not only to assist their Consultations in point of Law: but to moderate the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ervor of their Proceedings by the Fan of Reason. The whole Reformation brought within the compass of these seven Canons: 1. Concerning <hi>Chancellors Patents.</hi> 2. <hi>Chancellors not alone to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure any of the Clergy in sundry cases.</hi> 3. <hi>Excommunication and Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution not to be pronounced but by a PRIEST.</hi> 4. <hi>Concerning Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations, and the disposing of them.</hi> 5. <hi>Touching current Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> 6. <hi>Concerning Licences to marry.</hi> 7. <hi>Against vexatious Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the first of the seven it was required,
<q>That no Bishop should grant any Patent to any Chancellor, Commissary, or Official, for any longer time than the life of the Grantee only; That in all such Patents the Bishops should reserve to themselves and their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors the power of giving institution to Benefices,<note place="margin">

                  <p>For preventing those vexations and inconveniencies which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had been occasioned by concurrent Jurisdictions, It was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by the fift Canon, under the several penalties therein contained,
<q>That no Register or Clerk should give, nor Apparitor execute a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon any Executor to appear in any Court or Office till ten daies after the Death of the Testator; And that nevertheless it might be lawful for any Executor to prove such Wills when they think good, within the said ten daies before any Ecclesiastical Judge respectively, to whose Jurisdiction the same might or did appertain.

And for preventing of vexatious Citations for the time to come, it was required by the last <hi>Canon,</hi> That no Citation should from thenceforth be issued out of any Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Court, except it be upon Presentment, but such as should be sent forth under the Hand and Seal of the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> within thirty days after the fault committed; the Return thereof to be made on the first or second Court-day after the serving of the same: And that the Party so cited, not being convinced by two Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Finally, For pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting all unnecessary Tautologies and Repetitions of the same thing, it was declared once for all,

                  <p>To the Proceedings of this Committee in digesting these <hi>Canons,</hi> the interposing of another business gave no stop at all, though it seemed to be of more weight than all the rest.

Nor did the Archbishop speed much better in a Motion of his, which was, That his Majesty might be moved for the new Printing of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer Book</hi> in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, to the end (though I cannot positively say that he expressed so much at that time) that it might be used in all <hi>Colledges</hi> and <hi>Halls,</hi> in Officiating the <hi>Morning-Prayer,</hi> at which no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e are bound to be present, but such as are presumed to understand the Language. For doing whereof, he conceived he had good ground in the first <hi>Rubricks</hi> after the <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Common-Prayer Book</hi>; in which it is declared, <hi>That though it be appointed in the aforesaid Preface, that all things should be Read and Sung in the</hi> English <hi>Tongue, to the end that the Congregation may be thereby Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: yet it is not meant, but when men say Morning and Evening Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er privately, they may say the same in any Language that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do understand.</hi> And he had also the constant example of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in <hi>Oxon.</hi> in which the first <hi>Morning-Prayers</hi> were continually Officiated in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, for the <hi>Prebends, Students,</hi> and others of the Foundation; and at the Cathedral-hours, in the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> only, for Instruction and Devotion of the <hi>Choir-men, Alms-men, Servants,</hi> and all others which resort unto them.</p>
                  <p>It is a matter which deserves no small Admiration, That these <hi>Canons</hi> (like the first building of the Temple, without the noise of Ax and Hammer) should pass the House with such a general calm and quiet, and be received with so many Storms and Tempests when they went abroad.

discouragement, if not the plain overthrow of their Profession. To which it was answered by the Archbishop, and the Council too, That nothing but their Excrescences and Exorbitances, were by those <hi>Canons</hi> pared away; all their Preferments, with the Profits and Lawful Fees which belonged unto it, remaining as before they were. Yet the <hi>Civilians</hi> made not so much noise as some <hi>Common Lawyers,</hi> who look'd upon the Granting of a Benevolence by <hi>Convocation,</hi> and the Levying of it by <hi>Synodical Acts</hi> and <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as being an Incroachment on the Priviledges and Rights of Parliament, without the Midwifery whereof, the <hi>Clergie</hi> could Enact no <hi>Canons</hi> to bind the Subjects, in such pecuniary Payments as were laid upon them.

Nor is it a speculative Authority only, and not reducible unto Practice; an Authority which was then in force, but not in use, as is distinguished in some Cases. They had a Precedent for it in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, as before was noted; not then beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>But nothing raised so much noise and clamour, as the Oath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the sixth <hi>Canon</hi>; Exclaimed against both from the <hi>Pulpit</hi> and the <hi>Press</hi>; Reproached in printed Pamphlets, and unprinted Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and glad they were to find such an excellent Advantage, as the discovering of an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Body of it, did unhappily give them.

                     </gap> the fact, That in all the <hi>Canons</hi> which were made before this (b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="444" facs="tcp:54785:225" rendition="simple:additions"/>
persons having peculiar or exempt Jurisdiction; which having been repeated distinctly or particularly in such of the <hi>Canons</hi> as were first made, was in the first drawing of their Oath, for avoiding of a Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologie so often iterated, cut off with this <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with an intention nevertheless to make the Enumeration perfect (and consequently to expunge this unlucky <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) before it came to be Engrossed. But the King being weary of the Charge and Clamour, which the keeping of a Guard on the <hi>Convocation</hi> did expose him to, did hasten them to a Conclusion by so many Messages brought by <hi>Vane</hi> and others, that in the haste this unlucky <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was forgotten, and so committed to the Press accordingly. It hath been secondly answered, as in point of Reason, That the <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it stands in that part of the Oath, is so restrained and limited by the following words, <hi>viz. as it stands now established,</hi> that there can be no danger of any <hi>Mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> in it: So that in the Construction of this Text, the <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it now remains, is a meer impertinency: For being left in, it signifieth nothing, in regard of the Restriction following; and being left out, the sense is currant and compleat without it. Which all those witty Gentlemen who so often spoke, and others of less wit and quality, which so frequently writ against this Oath, could not chuse but see: but that they were not willing to see any thing which might make against them. The Paramount Objection being thus refell'd, the rest which have been made against it will be easily satisfied. It hath been charged by some, That the exacting of an Oath not to consent to the Alteration of the Government of the Church by Archbishops, Bishops, Deans, Archdeacons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is an affront to the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Rules of Civil Politie. To which it hath been answered, That it is indeed <hi>an affront to Government,</hi> not to submit or yield Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto <hi>Civil Sanctions</hi> when made, and legally established: But it is no <hi>affront</hi> not to give <hi>consent</hi> to any such <hi>Establishments,</hi> while they are in Treaty; for then the liberty of assenting or dissenting, of Yea or Nay, would be taken away from every Member in the Houses of Parliament, and every Man must give <hi>consent</hi> to every Bill which is offered to him. But besides this, there were but few of the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> whose consent was likely to be asked, when any change of Church-Government should be set on foot; so that their dissenting or assenting was not much material: but only so far as by their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness of consenting to such Innovations in the Publick Government, they might encourage others to proceed against it. Here then is no affront to Government, much less to the Fundamentals of it; the Oath not binding any man not to yield Obedience, but not to give consent to such Alteration. As for the last Objection, That he who takes the Oath declares therein, <hi>That he takes it willingly,</hi> being constrained so to do under grievous Penalties. This as it comes last, is the least considerable; for if this were a Crime in the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> it was such a Crime as the High Court of Parliament hath been guilty of, in drawing up the Oath of Allegiance in the third
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:54785:225"/>
year of King <hi>Iames;</hi> in which the Party is to swear, That he makes <hi>that Recognition</hi> not only <hi>heartily</hi> and <hi>truly,</hi> but also <hi>willingly:</hi> and yet the taking of that Oath is imposed on all the Subjects, under se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Penalties, if any of them shall refuse it.</p>
                  <p>And yet these Quarrels at the Oath, the Unparliamentary Levying of the said Benevolence, and the pretended Illegality of their very Sitting after the Parliament expired, were but the out-sides of the business, but only colours and disguises to conceal the chief cause of their displeasure from the publick view. Somewhat there was which galled them more than all these together; that is to say, the <hi>Propositions</hi> for asserting the <hi>Regal Power,</hi> making it absolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent with reference both to <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> to the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and trouble of the Popular Party, since better known by the name of <hi>Commonwealths-men.</hi> Which since the <hi>English</hi> were not confident enough to speak out at first, we must take their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <hi>Scots,</hi> who in the Articles exhibited against our Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop by their Commissioners, have expresly charged him with this Crime,<note place="margin">

This the true cause of those high Displeasures, conceived by some prevailing Members of the House of Commons, and openly declared by their Words and Actions, branding those innocent <hi>Canons</hi> for a tendency to <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Sedition,</hi> which they most laboured to suppress; condemning all that Voted to them, in great sums of Money; and afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying them one by one, as they came in their way. Compared with this, neither the Benevolence, nor the Oath, nor any thing else before objected, was esteemed considerable; though all were joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together to amuze the People, and make them fearful of some Plot, not only to subvert Religion, but their Civil Rights.</p>
                  <p>But the best is, that howsoever some few men for their private ends reproached these <hi>Canons,</hi> as before; his Sacred Majesty, the Lords of his most Honourable Privy-Council, the Reverend Judges, and the Great Lawyers of the Council-Learned, conceived other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of them; in the hearing of all which they were publickly read by the Archbishops procurement, before they were tendred to the Clergy to be subscribed: and by all which they were approved, not without thanks to the Archbishop from the King himself, for his pains therein. And certainly it had been strange that they should pass the Approbation of the Judges and Learned Lawyers, had they contained any thing <hi>against the Fundamental Laws of the Land, the Property of the Subject, and the Rights of Parliaments</hi>; or been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

Upon the doing whereof, his Majesty was graciously pleased to restore him to his former Liberty; though this Submission ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared within few years after, to be made either with some mental Reservation, or Jesuitical Equivocation, which he came prepared with. For in the time of his last Sickness, he declared himself to be a Member of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and caused it so to be expressed
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:54785:226"/>
in his last Will and Testament, that the news thereof might spread the further, and his Apostacy stand upon Record to all future Ages. A Scandal so unseasonably given, as if the Devil himself had watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an opportunity to despite this Church,</p>
                  <p>But these things hapned not till after. The Sentence of Suspension was no sooner pronounced, but the Archbishop giving great thanks to the Bishops and the rest of the Clergy for their pains and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, in doing so much Work in so little time, produced his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Writ for dissolving the said <hi>Convocation</hi>; which he according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed, and dissolved the same. The Acts whereof being trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto <hi>York,</hi> were by the <hi>Convocation</hi> for that Province peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, debated, and approved without any disputing; and so present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Majesty with their Names subscribed, according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Custom. There remained now nothing more to do, for giving these <hi>Canons</hi> the Authority and Reputation of his Majesties Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Laws, but the signifying of his Royal Assent, and confirming them by Letters Patents under the Great Seal of <hi>England.</hi> And this his Majesty, upon mature deliberation, was graciously pleased to do, commanding in the same,
<q>That they should be diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, executed, and equally kept by all his Subjects, both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Provinces of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York</hi> respectively: That for the better observation of them, all Ministers should audibly and distinctly read all the said <hi>Canons</hi> in the Church or Chappel in which they Minister, at the time of Divine Service; The Book of the said <hi>Canons</hi> to be provided before <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> at the charge of their Parishes: And finally, That all Archbishops and Bishops, and others having Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, shall take special care that the said <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> be in all points duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served; not sparing to execute the Penalties in them severally mentioned, upon any that shall wittingly or wilfully break or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect to observe the same, as they tendred the Honour of God, the Peace of the Church, the Tranquility of the Kingdom, and their Duties and Service to his Majesty their King and Sovereign.</q>
With which his Majesties Letters Patents, bearing date on <hi>Iune</hi> 13. confirmatory of the Acts of the said <hi>Convocations,</hi> I conclude the fourth and busiest part of this present History,</p>

<q>For taking notice of the inclination of the times to Sacriledge, and Spoil, and Rapine; and finding nothing more frequent in the mouths of men, then this, that they which endowed Churches with Lands poisoned Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; that Tithes and Oblations are now in the sight of God but as the sacrificed blood of Goats; and that fulness of bread ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made the Children wanton, it was without any scruple to be taken away from them, He made upon the whole matter, this ensuing Judgement: By this means (saith he) or the like suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons received with all joy, and with like sedulity practiced in certain parts of the Christian World, they have brought to pass that as <hi>David</hi> doth say of man, so it is in hazard to be verified concerning the whole Religion and service of God, <hi>The time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may peradventure fall out to be threescore and ten years, or if strength do serve unto fourscore,</hi> what followeth is like to be small joy for them whosoever they be that behold the same.</q>

But that which was more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable then either of these, happened the same night at the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitical Church in the City of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; where one of the Pinacles upon the top of the <hi>Bell-frey</hi> Tower, which carried a vane, with this Archbishops Arms upon it, was violently struck down, but born a good distance from the Steeple, to fall upon the Roof of the Cloyster under which the Arms of the Archiepiscopal See it self, were engraven in stone; which Arms being broken to pieces by the fall of the other, gave occasion unto one who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him not, to collect this Inference, that the <hi>Arms of the present Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>breaking down the Arms of the See of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>not only portended his own fall, but the Ruine of the Metropolitical dignity by the weight thereof.</hi> Of these mis-fortunes, (which some men perhaps may call Presages) he took not so much notice, as he did of an accident which happened on S. <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Iude's</hi> e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Papists which had hope to effect great matters by the Power and Prevalency of the Queen, found the Archbishop so averse from their courses, and the King so resolute in the maintainance of the true Protestant Religion here by Law established, that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it necessary to remove them both out of the way, before any thing could be effected answerable to their expectation. A confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy was formed amongst them, consisting of some of the most subtle heads in the whole Jesuitical party; by whom it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded

This gave him a sufficient warning to expect a storm, and to prepare himself against it; which he did with so much care and courage, that though he was assaulted that night with a confused Raskal Rabble of five hundred persons, yet they were not able either to force the House, or do any visible harm unto it. The next day he procured some pieces of Cannon, which he caused to be planted for defence of the great Gate which leads into the house, and strengthned all the lesser doors which opened towards the Garden, and other places; so that there was no danger to be feared from the like alarms, though prudently he withdrew to his Chamber at <hi>Whitehall</hi> till the Rage of the People was blown over. Some of the principal Actors in this Sedition being apprehended and committed to the Goal in <hi>Southwark,</hi> were forcibly delivered by others of their Accomplices, who brake open that and all the other Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in that <hi>Precinct</hi>; for which one <hi>Benslead,</hi> who appeared in the head of that Riot, was on the 21. of <hi>May</hi> condemned for Treason, and was accordingly drawn, hanged, and quartered, for a terrour to others. Which seasonable Execution put an end to the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, but not to the malice of the People; Libels against him being scattered in most parts of the City.

Howsoever thinking it as unsafe as it was imprudent to tempt the Rabble to bestow another visit on him at his house in <hi>Lambeth,</hi> he gave order that the <hi>High Commission</hi> should be kept in St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and he did well and wisely in it.

The chief Command he had entrusted to the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> whom he had before made Admiral of his Royal Navy for defence of the Kingdom, honoured him with the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Garter,</hi> and made him one of the Lords of his <hi>Privy Council</hi>; so that no greater characters of Power and Favour could be imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on a Subject.

Of which three great Commanders it was observed, that one had sufficient health, but had no will to the business; That another had a good will to it, but wanted health; and that a third had neither the one nor the other.

<q>That as they desired the unworthy Authors of their trouble, who had come out from themselves, to be tried at home, according to their own Laws; so they would press no further Process against <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the rest of those pernicious Counsellors in <hi>England,</hi> whom they called the Authors of all the miseries of both Kingdoms, than what their own Parliament should discern to be their just deserving.</q>
And that the <hi>English</hi> might see the better whom they chiefly aimed at, a book was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by the name of <hi>Laudensium Autocatacrisis,</hi> or the <hi>Canterburi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Self-conviction</hi>; in which the Author of it did endeavour to prove, out of the Books, Speeches, and Writings of the Archbishop himself, as also of some Bishops, and other learned men, who had exercised their Pens in the late disputes, That there was a strange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in hand for bringing in <hi>Superstition, Popery,</hi> and <hi>Arminianism,</hi> to the subversion of the Gospel, and of suppressing the Religion here by Law established.</p>
                  <p>But as these Reproaches moved not him, so neither did their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance,</hi> or any other of their Scribbles distract his Majesties Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions, untill he found himself assaulted by a Petition from some Lords in the South, which threatned more danger at his back than

For Remedy whereof, his Majesty is desired to call a Parliament, to bring the Authors of the said pretended grievances to a Legal Trial, and to compose the present War without Bloudshed; Subscribed by the Earls of <hi>Essex, Hartford, Rutland, Bedford, Exeter, Warwick, Moulgrave,</hi> and <hi>Bullingbrooke,</hi> the Lords <hi>Say, Mandevil, Brooke,</hi> and <hi>Howard</hi>; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the King at <hi>York</hi> on the third of <hi>September</hi>; And seconded by another from the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London</hi> to the same effect. His Majesty, being thus between two Milstones, could find no better way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate himself out of these perplexities, than to call the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of his Peers, to whom at their first meeting, on the 24 of the same month, he signified his purpose to hold a Parliament in <hi>London</hi> on the third of <hi>November</hi>; and by their Counsel entertained a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with those of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who building on the confidence which they had in some Lords of <hi>England,</hi> had petitioned for it. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto which Advice a Commission is directed to eight Earls, and as many Barons of the English Nation, (seven of which had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed the former Petition) enabling them to treat with the <hi>Scots</hi> Commissioners, to hear their Grievances and Demands, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the same to his Majesty, and the Lords of his Council. These points being gained, which the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction in both Kingdoms had chiefly aimed at, the <hi>Scots</hi> were insolent enough in their Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals, Requiring freedom of Commerce, Reparation of their former Losses, and most especially the maintenance of their Army at the charge of the <hi>English</hi>; without which no Cessation would be hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to. Satisfaction being given them in their last Demand, and good Assurances for the two first, they decline <hi>York,</hi> as being unsafe for their Commissioners, and procure <hi>Rippon</hi> to be named, for the place of the Treaty; where the Lord Lieutenant was of less influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence than he was at <hi>York</hi>; and where being further from the King, they might shuffle the Cards, and play the Game to their best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. The rest of <hi>October,</hi> from the end of the first week of it, when they excepted against <hi>York,</hi> was drilled on, in requiring that some persons of quality, intrusted by the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation, might have more Offices than they had about his Majesty, and the Queen, and in the Court of the Prince. That a Declaration might be made for naturalizing and settling the Capacities and mutual Priviledges of the Subjects in both Kingdoms: but chiefly that there might be an Unity and Uniformity in Church-Government, as a special means for conserving of the Peace between the two Nations. And thus they

entertained the time till the beginning of the Parliament, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the Treaty from <hi>Rippon</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> where the <hi>Scots</hi> were sure of more Friends, and of warmer Quarters, than the Northern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties could afford them.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time it may be asked what became all this while o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the <hi>Irish</hi> Army, consisting of 8000 Foot, and 1000 Horse, which had been raised with so much zeal by the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Spring; and by the power whereof (kept ever since in constant pay and continual exercise) his Majesty might have redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the <hi>Scots</hi> to their due obedience, as was declared by the Earl at the Council Table on <hi>May</hi> 6. being the next day after the dissolving of the former Parliament. Which Army if it had been put over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Cumberland</hi> (to which from the Port of <hi>Carickfergus</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> is but a short and easie passage) they might have got upon the Back of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and caught the wretched People in a pretty Pitfall; so that having the <hi>English</hi> Army before them, and the <hi>Irish</hi> behind them, they could not but be ground to powder as between two Milstones. But this design, if it were ever thought of, was never put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; so as that Army was dissolved without doing any thing in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Majesties Service: the Commons in the following Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not thinking themselves or their affairs in any security as long as those Forces were maintained and held together. It may be askt in the next place, why the Parliament, called at such a time, and on such an occasion, (that is to say, the over-running of the Northern parts of the Kingdom by a <hi>Scottish</hi> Army) should be held at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>; when <hi>York</hi> (where the King was then in Person) lay nearer to the danger and the Scene of Action, and to the place of Treaty betwixt the Nations. These Reasons were sufficient to have moved the King to hold this Parliament at <hi>York,</hi> and not at <hi>Westminster,</hi> had he known nothing of the disaffections and engagements of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring City, as he knew too much. And he had some good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents too, which might have added no small weight to the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: For when King <hi>Edward</hi> was busie in the Conquest of <hi>Wales,</hi> he called his Parliament to <hi>Acton Burnel,</hi> being in the <hi>Marches</hi> of that Country; and when he turned his Forces to the Conquest of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he called his Parliament to <hi>Carlisle</hi> (if my memory fall me not) being on the borders of that Kingdom. Had the King made choice of the like Place for this present Parliament (which he did afterward endeavour to alter when it was too late (he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly prevented all those inconveniencies (or rather mischiefs) which the Pride, Purse, Faction, and Tumultuousness of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> did afterwards inforce upon him. And finally, It might be asked, What might move his Majesty to transfer the Treaty from <hi>Rippon</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> where the Commissioners of the <hi>Scots</hi> were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented, Feasted, and presented by the wanton Citizens; Their Lodgings more frequented for Prayers and Sermons, than the houses of Foreign Embassadors had ever been for hearing <hi>Mass</hi> by any of
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:54785:232"/>
the <hi>English Papists.</hi> By means whereof they had the greater oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to enflame that City, and make it capable of any impression which they thought fit to imprint upon it; exprest not long after by their going down in such huge multitudes after Alderman <hi>Pennington,</hi> to present a Petition to the Parliament, subscribed by some Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of hands against the Government of Bishops here by Law esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To which no Answer can be given, but that all these things were so disposed of by the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and over-ruling power of the Heavenly Providence, contrary to all reason of State, and Civil Prudence.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, the third of <hi>November</hi> drawing on, when the Parliament was to take beginning, A Letter was writ to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> advertising, that the Parliament of the twentieth year of King <hi>Henry</hi> viii. which began in the Fall of Cardinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi> continued in the Diminution of the Power and Priviledges of the Clergy, and ended in the dissolution of the <hi>Abbeys</hi> and Religious Houses, was begun on the third day of <hi>November</hi>; and therefore that for good-luck sake he would move the King to Respite the first sitting of it for a day or two longer: But the Archbishop not hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to this Advertisement, the Parliament had its first sitting at the time appointed. Which Parliament as it began in the Fall and Ruine of the Archbishop himself, and was continued in the total Dissipation of the remaining <hi>Rites</hi> and Priviledges of the <hi>English</hi> Clergy; so did it not end till it had subverted the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, dissolved, as much as in them was, all <hi>Capitular</hi> Bodies, and left the <hi>Cathedrals</hi> of this Land (not presently ruined I confess, but) without means to keep them up for the time to come. The day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed being come, his Majesty declined the accustomed way of riding in a Magnificent Pomp from <hi>Whitehall</hi> to the Church of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> and making his entry there at the great Western Gate: but rather chose to pass thither privately by water, attended by such of the Lords as could accommodate themselves with convenient Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Entring the Church at the Little door which openeth toward the East, he was received by the Sub-Dean and Prebendaries under a Canopy of State, and so conducted to the place where he heard the Sermon; the performance of which work was commended by his Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Oxon.</hi> and by him lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly discharged. The Sermon being done, his Majesty, attended by the Peers and Prelates, returned the same way to <hi>Westminster Hall,</hi> and from thence went to the Parliament House; where causing the Commons to be called before him, he acquainted both Houses with the Insolencies committed by the <hi>Scots,</hi> who not content to embroyle their own Country had invaded this; requiring their time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assistance to drive the Rebels out of the Kingdom, and casting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But of this Prelate we have spoke so much upon other occasions, that we may save the labour of any further addition, than that he died as full of years as he was of honours, an affectionate Subject to his Prince, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Father to his Clergy, a bountiful Patron to his Chaplains, and a true friend to all which relied upon him; more fortunate in the time of his death than the course of his life, in being prevented by that blessed opportunity from seeing those calamities which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fell upon the King, the Church, and all that wish well to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them; which must have been more grievous to him than a thousand deaths. But this bad news retarded not the Convocation from proceeding forwards, the Prelates and Clergy attending the Archbishop from the Chapter-house into the Choire, where they heard the Sermon, Preached at that time by <hi>Bargrave</hi> then Dean of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; which done, the Clergy settled to the choice of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutor, electing the same man who had before discharged the Place with so much dexterity. Adjourned to <hi>Westminster,</hi> and Protestation made by the Sub-Dean and Prebends, according to the usual cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, the Prolocutor was presented to the Archbishop and Bishops in the Chappel of King <hi>Henry</hi> vii. at what time the Archbishop in an eloquent but sad Oration, bemoaned the infelicities which he saw hanging over the Church, advising every one there present to perform their Duties, and not to be wanting to themselves, or the cause of Religion, as far forth as they were concerned in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places. Nothing more done of any moment in this Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that a motion was made by <hi>Warmistre,</hi> one of the Clerks for the Diocess of <hi>Worcester,</hi> to this effect; <hi>viz.</hi> That they should endeavour (according to the <hi>Levitical</hi> Laws) <hi>to cover the Pit which they had opened,</hi> and to prevent their Adversaries intention by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning such offensive Canons as were made in the last Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He had before offered at many things in that Convocation, but such was his ill-luck, that the Vote was for the most part passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he spake; nor had he better fortune in his motion now, than his offers then, the Members of that House not being willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn themselves till they were accused. So that not having any other way to obtain his purpose, he caused a long Speech, which he had made upon this occasion, to be put in Print; bitter enough against some Canons and Proceedings in the former Session: but such as could not save him from a Sequestration, when the rest of the Clergy were brought under the same condition.</p>
                  <p>Whilst these things were acting on the Stage of <hi>Westminster,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> was not Idle in acting his part at <hi>York,</hi> amongst the Souldiers, whose affections he had gained so far, that he was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally beheld with esteem and veneration. He had before sufficient proof, how strongly the <hi>Scots</hi> aimed at his destruction, expressed in their Remonstrance, and the <hi>Intentions</hi> of their Army, (as they
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:54785:233"/>
called the Pamphlet) but more especially by the refusal of the <hi>Scots</hi> Commissioners to hold the Treaty at <hi>York,</hi> and the reasons given for their refusal; for in a Paper of theirs, presented on <hi>October</hi> 8.
<q>They had insisted on the danger apprehended by them in going to <hi>York,</hi> and casting themselves and others, who might be joyned with them, into the hands of an Army commanded by the Lord <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> against whom (as a chief Incendiary according to their demands, which was the subject of the Treaty it self) they resolved to proceed.</q>
They complained also in that Paper, That in the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> he had proceeded against them as <hi>Traitors</hi> and <hi>Rebels</hi>; That he honoured them in his common talk with no better Titles; That his Commission was to destroy them; And that by all means, and by all occasions, he had hindred all Propositions tending to a Pacification, for fear himself might be excluded from the benefit of it. He was not without a strong presumption, that the <hi>Scots</hi> were animated unto these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and incouraged to invade the Kingdom, by some of those which were of greatest Prevalency in both Houses of Parliament. And lying so near the <hi>Scots,</hi> in the head of his Army, he had not only gained assurance (as he conceived) in many particulars to confirm it, but that there was a Confederacy made between the Heads of the <hi>Covenanters</hi> and some of the leading Members of both Houses, his most Capital Enemies, to subject the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, and innovate in that of the Civil State; which Intelligence being digested into the Form of an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he intended to present to the House of Peers as soon as he had taken his place amongst them: and to that end prepared for his last Journey to <hi>London,</hi> from whence he never was to return alive. Calling together some of his especial Friends, and many of the chief Officers and Commanders which remained in the Army, he made them acquainted with his purpose of going to <hi>Westminster</hi> to attend the Parliament, leaving to them the Charge of his Majesties Forces, and the preserving of those parts from the spoyl of the Enemy. An Enterprise from which he was disswaded by most of his Friends, alledging that he could not chuse but know, that the <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Scotizing English</hi> had most infallibly resolved on his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; and that innocency was no Armour of Proof against the fiery Darts of malicious Power; That seeing such a storm hang over his head, rather keep himself in the <hi>English</hi> Army, (being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Command, which he had gained upon exceedingly by his noble carriage) or pass over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the Army rested wholly at his Devotion; or transport himself to some Foreign King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, till fairer weather here (in reference to his own safety and the publick peace) should invite him home; That it was no betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his innocency to decline a Trial where Partiality held the Scales, and Self-ends backt with Power, and made blind with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, were like to over-ballance Justice; That if Sentence should
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:54785:234"/>
be passed against him for default of appearance (which was the worst that could befal him) yet he would then keep his head on his shoulders until better times, and in the mean season might do his Majesty as good Service in the Courts of many Foraign Princes, as if he were sitting in <hi>White-hall</hi> at the Council Table.</p>
                  <p>Turning a deaf car to these considerations, he Resolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute his design, but was scarce entred into the House of Peers, when followed at the heels by <hi>Pym</hi> (whom it concerned as much as any) who fearing or knowing his intendments, impeacht him of high Treason, in the name of all the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their names that he might be sequestred from the House, and Committed to Custody. And here again it was conceived that the Earl shewed not that <hi>praesentiam animi,</hi> that readiness of Courage and Resolution, which formerly had conducted him through so many difficulties, in giving over his design; For though he lost the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of striking the first blow, yet he had time enough to strike the second, which might have been a very great Advantage to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation. For had he offered his impeachment, and prosecuted it in the same paces and method as that was, which was brought against him, it is possible enough that the business on both sides might have been hushed up without hurt to either. And for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he wanted not a fair Example in the second Parliament of this King, when the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> being impeached of high Treason by the Kings Attorney at the instance and procurement of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> retorted presently a recrimination or impeachment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Duke, and by that means took of the edge of that great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary from proceeding further. Nor gave it little cause of wonder unto many wise men, that a person of so great Spirit and knowledge, should give himself up so tamely on a general accusation only, without any particular Act of Treason charged upon him, or any proof offered to make good that charge; not only to the loss of his Liberty as a private Person: but to the forfeiture of his Priviledge as a Member of Parliament. But the impeachment being made, his Restraint desired, and nothing by him offered to the Contrary, he was committed the same day (<hi>Novemb.</hi> 11.) to the Custody of the Gentleman <hi>Vsher,</hi> called the Black-rod, and not long after to the Tower; Sir <hi>George Ratcliff</hi> one of his especial confidents, being presently sent for out of <hi>Ireland</hi> by a Serjeant at Arms, as concriminal with him. In this condition he remained, till the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Decemb.</hi> without any particular Charge against him; Which at the last was brought into the House of Peers by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and presented in their Names by Lord <hi>Paget</hi> one of the Members of that House. In which they did inform against him, in reference to matters which concerned Religion, that in promoting the late pretended Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations he had been as forward as <hi>Canterbury</hi> hims<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lf; and to that end had preferred his Chaplain <hi>Bramhall</hi> to the See of <hi>Derrie,</hi> and <hi>Chappel</hi> to the Colledge of <hi>Dublin</hi>: that he had threatned to
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:54785:234"/>
burn the Articles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> agreed upon in Convocation <hi>Anno</hi> 1615. by the hand of the Hangman, and would not hearken to the <hi>Primate,</hi> when he desired a Ratification of them by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for preventing and suppressing the said Innovations; that he countenanced divers books against them and their Covenant, which were Printed at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and caused all Persons above the age of sixteen years, to abjure the said Covenant by a solemn Oath, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be Imprisoned or to fly that Kingdom; that at his last coming into <hi>England</hi> he had openly said, that if ever he returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Honourable Sword he would not leave any of the <hi>Scots</hi> in that Kingdom, either Root or Branch; and that he did advise the great Council of Peers assembled at <hi>York,</hi> to send them back again in their own blood, and that he might whip them out of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In further pursuance of this Charge, it was prest against him in the Articles Exhibited by the House of Commons on the 16<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> of <hi>February</hi> (for so long it was, before he heard any more news from them) That he maintained a correspondence with the <hi>Papists</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> endeavoured to raise hostility between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and had consented to the betraying of <hi>New-castle</hi> into the hands of the <hi>Scots</hi>; to the end that the <hi>English</hi> being nettled by so great a loss, might be more Cordially engaged in the War against them; that he gave a Warrant under his hand to some Bishops in the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and their Chancellors and other Officers, to Arrest the Bodies of such of the meaner sort, as after Citation, should refuse to appear before them, or should refuse to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go and perform all Lawful decrees and sentences, given or issued out against them, and the said persons to keep in the next Common Goal, till their Submission to the said Orders and Decrees, and otherwise shew some Reason to the Contrary to the Lords of the Counsel; that in the Moneth of <hi>May</hi> in the year 1639. he caused a new Oath to be contrived, Enforced especially upon those of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation in the Realm of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by which the party was obliged to Renounce the Covenant, and to swear that he would not <hi>Protest</hi> against any of his Majesties Royal Commands, but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himself in all obedience thereunto, and had put divers grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous fines upon many of them on their Refusal of the same; that he required the like Oath for the Observation of all Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies then established, or from thenceforth to be established, by the Kings Authority, saying, that he would prosecute all Repugners of them to the very Blood. The Rest of the Articles relating unto Civil matters I omit of purpose, as neither being pertinent or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to my Present History; observing only in this place, that for the better carrying on of their charge against him, they had gained two points, more necessary to be craved than fit to be granted; The first was (which they carried in the House of Lords by a Major Vote) that no Bishop should be of that Committee for the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:54785:235"/>
Examinations in the present case, under colour that they were excluded from acting in it by some Ancient Canons, as <hi>in Causa sangiums,</hi> or the cause of blood; concerning which a brief discourse entituled <hi>De jure Paritatis Episcoporum,</hi> was presented to his Grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and some other Bishops for asserting all their Rights of <hi>Peerage</hi> (and this of being of that Committe amongst the rest) which either by Law or Ancient Custom did belong unto them. The second was that the Lords of the Council should be examined upon Oath, for anything which was said or done by the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> at the Council Table, Which being yielded by the King; though tending visibly to the Derogation of his Power, and the discouragement of all such as either were or should be of his Privy Council, the Archbishop was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Examined on <hi>December</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> being the next day after the said Condescention.</p>
                  <p>Nor was it long before the like Oath was required and obtained by them against the Archbishop himself, being the next man whom the <hi>Scots</hi> and their Confederates in both houses, had an eye upon. He knew there was some danger coming toward him by the said combination, but thought not at the first it would reach so far, as to touch his Life. The most he looked for, as he told the Author of these Collections on the second or third day after the beginning of the Parliament, was to be sequestred from his Majesties Councils, and confin'd to his Diocess, to which he profest himself as willing as any of his Enemies were desirous of it. And as it seems his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at the first had no further thoughts. For it appeareth by a passage in his <hi>Diary</hi> that on Thursday <hi>Decemb.</hi> 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> four Earls of Great Power in the Upper House declared unto a Parliament man, that they were resolved to Sequester him only from the Kings Council, and deprive him of the Archiepiscopal dignity, and no more then so; which though it were too much, and savoured of too little Justice to be so resolved before any particular charge was brought against him: yet I consider it as an Argument of their first intentions, that they aimed not at his Life, but at his removal. In Order whereunto it was thought expedient, that his Majesty should be moved to release the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> from his long imprisonment, and to restore him to his place in the house of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Upon which general Goal-delivery, <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>Prynne</hi> had so contrived it as to come together, met on their way as far as <hi>Brainford</hi> by some thousands of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction out of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>South-wark,</hi> and by them silently conducted with Bays and Rosemary in their hands, to their several Houses to the intolerable affront of the Courts of Justice, and his Majesties Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, his Majestie conniving at the insolency or not daring to punish it. Not well reposed after the toil and trouble of so long a journey, <hi>Prynne,</hi> joyns himself with <hi>Bagshaw</hi> before remembred, and both together are admitted to a private conference with the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> in the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> which boded no great good to the Church or State, or any who had formerly appeared in defence of either.</p>
                  <p>These preparations being made, the Project was carried on a main; For on the 16<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> of that month the Canons made in the late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, were condemned in the House of Commons, as being against the <hi>Kings Prerogative, the Fundamental Laws of the Realm, the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and containing divers other things tending to Sedition, and of dangerous Consequence.</hi> A Vote was also past for making <hi>Canterbury</hi> the Principal Author of the said Canons; for a Committee to be nominated to enquire into all his former Actions; and for preparing a Bill against all those of the said Convocation by whom these Canons were subscribed: but the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of that day, did not end there neither. For on the same, a charge was laid against him in the house of Peers by the <hi>Scots</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners (that being the day in which they had accused the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>) for doing ill offices, and being an Incendiary between the Nations. And in pursuance of the plot, on <hi>Fryday</hi> the 18<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> of the same Moneth, he was Impeacht by <hi>Hollis</hi> in the name of all the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> of no less then Treason; and thereupon, without any particular charge against him, he was committed to the custody of the Gentleman Usher, leave only being granted him, to repair to his house at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> for the Collecting of such Papers as were necessary for his Justification. At <hi>Maxwells</hi> house (for so was the Usher of the Black-Rod called) he remained ten weeks, before so much as any General charge against him, was brought up to the Lords.

to God and the King: <hi>And finally, That he was so industrious in advancing</hi> Popery <hi>in all the three Kingdoms, that the Pope himself could not have been more Popish, had he been in his place.</hi> Such was the Charge exhibited by the <hi>Scots</hi> Commissioners; in which was nothing criminal enough to deserve Imprisonment, much less to threaten him with Death. And as for that brought up from the House of Commons, it consisted of fourteen General Articles, as before was said, ushered in with a short Preamble made by <hi>Pym,</hi> and shut up with a larger Aggravation of the Offences compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the several Articles; the substance of which Articles was to this effect: 1. <hi>That he had Traiterously endeavoured to subvert the Fundamental Laws of the Realm, to introduce an Arbitrary and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Government, and to perswade his Majesty, That he might Lawfully raise Money of the Subject, without their common Consent in Parliament.</hi> 2. <hi>That to this end he had caused divers Sermons to be Preached, and Books to be Printed, against the Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and for asserting an absolute and unlimited Power over the Persons and Goods of the Subjects, to be not only in the King, but also in himself and the rest of the Bishops; and had been a great Promoter of such by whom the said Books and Sermons had been made and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</hi> 3. <hi>That by several Messages, Letters, Threatnings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he had interrupted and perverted the Course of Iustice in</hi> Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-Hall, <hi>whereby sundry of his Majesties Subjects had been stopp'd in their just Suits, and thereby made subject to his will.</hi> 4. <hi>That he had traiterously and corruptly sold Iustice to such as had Causes depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him, and taken unlawful Gifts and Bribes of his Majesties Subjects; and had advised and procured his Majesty to sell Places of Iudicature and other Offices.</hi> 5. <hi>That he had caused a Book of Canons to be Composed and Published without lawful Authority, in which were many things contained contrary to the Kings Prerogative, the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and had caused many of the same to surreptitiously passed, and afterwards by fear and compulsion to be subscribed by the Prelates and Clerks there assembled, notwithstanding they had never been Voted and Passed in the Convocation.</hi> 6. <hi>That he hath assumed to himself a Papal and Tyrannical Power, both in Eccesiastical and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Matters, over his Majesties Subjects in this Realm, and other places, to the disherison of the Crown, dishonour of his Majesty, and derogation of his Supreme Authority in Ecclesiastical Matters.</hi> 7. <hi>That he had endeavoured to alter and subvert Gods true Religion, by Law established in this Realm, and instead thereof to set up Popish Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and Idolatry; and to that end had maintained many Popish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, enjoyned many Popish and Superstitious Ceremonies, and cruelly vexed and persecuted such as refused to conform unto them.</hi> 8. <hi>That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

such as were Popishly affected, or otherwise unsound in Doctrine, or corrupt in Manners.</hi> 9. <hi>That to the same intent he had chosen such men to be his Chaplains, whom he knew to be notoriously disaffected to the Reformed Religion; and had committed unto them, or some of them, the Licencing of Books to be Printed, whereby many false and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Books had been Published, to the great scandal of Religion, and the seducing of many of his Majesties Subjects.</hi> 10. <hi>That he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to reconcile the Church of</hi> England <hi>to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>confederating to that end with divers Popish Priests and Iesuits, holding Intelligence with the Pope, and permitting a Popish Hierarchy or Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Government to be established in this Kingdom.</hi> 11. <hi>That in his own Person, and by others under his Command, he had caused divers Godly and Orthodox Ministers of Gods Word to be Silenced, Suspended, and otherwise grieved, without any lawful or just cause, hindred the Proaching of Gods Word, cherished Prophaneness and Ignorance amongst the People, and compelled many of his Majesties Subjects to forsake the Kingdom.</hi> 12. <hi>That he had endeavoured to cause discord between the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and other Reformed Churches; and to that end had suppressed and abrogated the Priviledges and Immunities which had been by his Majesty and his Royal Ancestors granted to the</hi> Dutch <hi>and</hi> French <hi>Churches in this Kingdom.</hi> 13. <hi>That he had endeavoured to stir up War between his Majesties Kingdoms of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland; <hi>and to that end had laboured to introduce into the Kingdom of</hi> Scotland <hi>divers Innovations both in Religion and Government: for their refusing whereof, he first advised his Majesty to subdue them by force of Arms, and afterwards to break the Pacification made between the Kingdoms; forcing the Clergie to contribute toward the Maintenance of the War.</hi> 14. <hi>And finally, That to preserve himself from being questioned for these and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Danger first, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the questioning of so great a Prelate, left the Church open to the Assaults of a potent Faction, and the poor Clergy destitute of a constant Patron.

<pb n="469" facs="tcp:54785:237"/>
the Minister Officiating the Second Service at the Communion-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, according to the ancient Custom, was unexpectedly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the naming and singing of a Psalm, to the great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all sober and well-minded men. And at the Meeting of some <hi>Anabaptists</hi> to the number of 80. at a House in <hi>Southwark,</hi> it was preached, That the Statute 35 <hi>Eliz. for restraining the Queens Majesties Subjects in their due Obedience,</hi> was no good Law, because made by Bishops; striking at once both at the <hi>Liturgie</hi> and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church by Law established. The Bishops left out of the Committee for Examinations, in the business of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>; and in all other Committees, by the fraud and artifice of the Clerk of the Parliament, not named in such proportion to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Peers, as had been accustomed. The same Clerk at the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such Bills as came into that House, turned his back toward them in disdain, that they might not distinctly hear what he read; as if their consenting or dissenting to the point in question, had been judged unnecessary. And to prepare the way the better for their Declination, <hi>Pennington</hi> attended by some hundreds of the Raskal Rabble, presents a Petition to the Commons, in the name of the City of <hi>London,</hi> subscribed by 15000 hands of several qualities, most of them indigent in Estate, and of known disaffections to the present Goverment. In which Petition it was prayed, That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Bishops might be abolished; That Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies might be press'd no longer upon the consciences of the weak; and that many other things at which they found themselves grieved, might be also abrogated. After which followed many bitter Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es made against them by the Lord <hi>Faulkland, Bagshaw, White,</hi> and others, in the House of Commons; by the Lords <hi>Say</hi> and <hi>Brook</hi> in the House of Peers; by <hi>Brook</hi> alone in a Printed Pamphlet, in which he reproacheth them as born of the Dregs of the People: the names of the Lords Spiritual being despitefully left out of all Bills which passed this Session, to shew how insignificant they were in an Act of Parliament. And all this seconded by many Petitions of like nature, in the name of many whole Counties and Populous Cities, and in their names presented to the Houses of Parliament; though the said Petitions, for the most part, were never either seen or heard of by the greatest and most considerable number of those in whose names they were subscribed. Which coming to his Majesties knowledge, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both Houses unto <hi>Whitehall, Ianuary</hi> 25.
<q>Where he informed them of the Distractions that were then occasioned through the connivence of the Parliament, there being some men who more maliciously than ignorantly, would put no difference between Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="470" facs="tcp:54785:238"/>
in which they stood in the best and happiest times of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; That he could not but take notice of many Petitions given in the name of divers Counties, against the established Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church; and of the great threatnings against the Bishops, That they will make them to be but Cyphers, or at least their Voices to be taken away; That if upon serious debate, they could sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to say truth, it concerned the King to look about him, when his own Regal Power, not that of the Bishops only, was so openly strook at; it being Preached by the said <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi> but the Week before, <hi>That he could not make a good Law, because not PERFECTLY REGENERATE, and was only to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>As an Expedient to the Work, it was sound necessary to question and disgrace all those, who either had been active in advancing those Publick Orders, which were now branded by the name of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, or otherwise industrious in his Majesties Service; some to be sacrificed to the pleasure of particular Persons, others to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the fury or discontentments of the People generally. Of the first sort were <hi>Pocklington</hi> and <hi>Bray,</hi> both Doctors in Divinity; the first of late made Chaplain in Ordinary to the King, the second Chaplain of long time to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> This last had Licenced two of <hi>Pocklington</hi>'s Books, the one being a Sermon Preached at a Visitation before the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> the other a Discourse of <hi>Altars,</hi> and the most proper situation of the Lords Table, in which were many Passages against that Bishop: To pacifie which o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s great a tempest seemed to be brewing in the City, which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no less danger to the Church it self than those proceedings to the Clergy. For in the beginning of this year we find some Divines of name and note, convened in the Dean of <hi>Westminsters</hi> Lodgings, to consult about matters of the Church; the occasion this: The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation was then sitting, but not impowered by his Majesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to act in any thing of concernment. It was therefore orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Peers <hi>March</hi> 21. that a Committee of ten Earls, ten Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and ten Barons should be nominated, in the name of the rest, for settling the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fairs of the Church; by whom a Sub-Committee was the same day named to prepare such matters as were to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed and concluded by them, the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> being in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> both. Which Sub-Committee being made up of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:54785:239"/>
above-mentioned, consisted of three Bishops, nine Doctors in Divinity, and four of some inferiour Degree in the Universities; some of them being Prelatical, and some Presbyterian in point of Government, but all of them <hi>Calvinians</hi> in point of Doctrine. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning first with points of Doctrine, complaint was made that the whole body of <hi>Armimanism,</hi> and many particular points of <hi>Popery</hi> (for so they called all which agreed not with <hi>Calvin</hi>'s sense) had been of late maintained in Books and Sermons, and sometimes also in the Divinity Schools. And then descending to matter of Discipline, they discoursed of many Innovations, which they conceived to have been thrust upon the Church, most of them in disposing and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Communion Table, and the more reverent Administration of the holy Sacraments; some of them positively required, or at least directed by the Laws of the Land, as reading the Communion Service at the Lords Table on Sundaies and Holidaies, reading the Litany in the middest of the Church, the Ministers turning toward the East in the Creed and Prayers, and praying no otherwise before Sermons than in the words of the <hi>Canon</hi>; some of them never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been disused in many Parochial Churches, and retained in most Cathedrals since the Reformation, as standing at the Hymns, and the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> placing the Table Altarwise, and adoring toward it; some being left indifferent at the choice of the Minister, as the saying or singing of the <hi>Te Deum</hi> in Parochial Churches, officiating the Communion and the dayly prayers in the Latine tongue, in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Colledges and Halls, by and amongst such as are not ignorant of that Language; And others not of so great moment, as to make any visible alteration in the face of the Church, or sensible distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in the minds of the People: Which therefore might have been as well forborne as practiced, till confirmed by Authority, or otherwise might have been borne without any such clamour, as either out of ignorance or malice had been raised against them.</p>
                  <p>They also took into consideration some Rubricks in the Book of Common Prayer, and other things, which they thought sit to be rectified in it. Amongst which they advised some things not to be utterly disliked, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Hymns, Sentences, Epistles and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels, should be reprinted according to the new Translation; That the Meeter in the Psalms should be corrected, and allowed of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly; and that no Anthems should be sung in Colledges or Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Churches but such as were taken out of the Scripture, or the publick Liturgy; That fewer Lessons might be read out of the Books called Apocryphal, and the Lessons to be read distinctly, exclusive of the Liberty which is given to sing them as appears by the <hi>Rubrick</hi>; That the Rubrick should be cleared concerning the Ministers power for repulsing scandalous and notorious sinners from the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; and that the general Confession before the Communion be ordered to be said by the Minister only, the People repeating it after him; That these words in the Form of Matrimony viz. <hi>With
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:54785:240" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my body I thee worship,</hi> may be explained and made more intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; And that instead of binding the married Couple to receive the Communion on their Wedding day (which is seldom done) they may be obliged to receive it on the Sunday after, or the next Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion day following; That none be licenced to marry, or have their Banes asked, who shall not first bring a Certificate from their Minister, that they are instructed in the Catechism; and that it be not required that the Infant be dipt in the water (as is injoyned by the Rubrick) in the case of extremity. Some Passages they obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved impertinently, and not worth the altering, as the expunging of some Saints (which they falsly called <hi>Legendaries</hi>) out of the Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar; The constant adding of the Doxology at the end of the <hi>Pater noster</hi>; Reading of Morning and Evening Prayer dayly by the Curate, if not otherwise letted; The leaving out of the <hi>Benedicite,</hi> and the changing of the Psalm used in the Churching of Women; That those words (<hi>which only workest great marvels</hi>) be left out of the Prayer for the Bishops and Clergy; That <hi>Grievous sins</hi> instead of <hi>Deadly sins</hi> be used in the Letany; That the <hi>sanctifying</hi> of the Flood <hi>Iordan,</hi> be changed into <hi>sanctifying</hi> the Element of water, in the Form of Baptism; That those words, <hi>In sure and certain hope of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi> which are used at Burials, may be changed to these, <hi>knowing assuredly that the dead shall rise again</hi>; And that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination should be read at the Desk, and not in the Pulpit: all which remaining as they did could give no offence, and might have easily been changed to give some content. And finally, some things there were of which they desired a Reformation, which seemed to have so much of the <hi>Anti-Papist,</hi> that they came close to the <hi>Puritan, viz.</hi> That the Vestments prescribed by the first Liturgy of King <hi>Edward</hi> vi. should not be required, and the rule in that case to be altered; That the Alms should be gathered rather after, than before the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; These words, <hi>This is my body, This is my bloud,</hi> not to be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in great Letters; and that a Rubrick be inserted to declare, that kneeling at the Communion is required only in relation to the Prayer of the distribution, <hi>Preserve thee body and soul,</hi> &amp;c. That weekly Communion every Sunday be changed to monthly in Colledges and Cathedral Churches; That the <hi>Cross</hi> in Baptism be either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, or quite disused; and that in the Form of Confirmation these words importing, that Children baptized, are <hi>undoubtedly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> be no longer used; That no times of Restraint may be laid on Marriage; And that the <hi>Authoritative</hi> Form of <hi>Absolution</hi> in the Visitation of the sick may be turned to a Pronouncing or declaring of it.</p>
                  <p>I have the longer stood on the result of these Consultations, because of the different apprehensions which were had of the Consequents and Issue of them. Some hoped for a great Reformation to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by them, and settled by the Grand Committee both in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

the men considered) that Doctrinal <hi>Calvinism</hi> being once settled, more alterations would be made in the Publick Liturgy than at first appeared, till it was brought more near the Form of the <hi>Gallick</hi> Churches, after the Platform of <hi>Geneva.</hi> Certain I am, that the imprisoned Archbishop had no fancy to it, fearing least the <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> of Divines in <hi>Ierusalem</hi>-Chamber (so the place was called) might weaken the foundations of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; That this Assembly on the matter might prove the National <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to the great dishonour of the Church; and that when their Conclusions were brought unto the great Committee, the business would be over-ruled by the Temporal Lords, as double in number to the <hi>Bishops.</hi> But whatsoever his fears were they were soon removed, that Meeting being scattered, about the middle of <hi>May,</hi> upon the bringing in of a Bill against Deans and Chapters; which so divided the <hi>Convenors</hi> both in their persons and affections that they never after met together. Concerning which we are to know, that not only most of the <hi>Lords of the Lower</hi> House, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Lower-House Lords</hi> in the Upper House, resolving to pull up Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy by the very roots, thought it convenient to begin with lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Branches as laying no pretence to Divine Institution. The voting of which Bill exceedingly amazed all those of the Prelatical Clergy, as knowing at what Root it struck; though none seemed presently concerned in it but such as had some benefit or subsistance in those foundations. To still the great noise which was raised about it, the Commons seemed not unwilling that some of the Cathedral Clergy should advocate for the continuance of those Capitular Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and others of the contrary Party to present their Reasons for their Dissolution. The time appointed being come, <hi>Hacket,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and one of the Prebends of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> pleaded both learnedly and stoutly in behalf of those Churches; and <hi>Burges</hi> of <hi>Watford,</hi> who not long before brought down his <hi>Myrmidons</hi> to cry for Justice against <hi>Strafford,</hi> to the Parliament doors, was all for <hi>down with them, down with them to the very ground.</hi> But though they differed in their Doctrine, yet they agreed well enough in their applications: <hi>Burges</hi> declaring it unlawful, as well as <hi>Hacket,</hi> that the Revenues of those Churches should otherwise be imployed than to pious uses. This seemed to put the business to a stand for the present time, but <hi>Canterbury</hi> knowing with what case it might be resumed, advised the drawing of a Petition to both Houses of Parliament in the name of the University of <hi>Oxon.</hi> which had a great stock going in the Ship of the Church, not only for the preservation of the Episcopal Government, but of those Foundations, as being both the Encouragements and Rewards of Learning.

at an Instant, considered seasonably for themselves, that the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest way about, did many times prove the nearest way to the journeys end; A Bill was therefore passed in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and sent up to the Lords, by which it was to be Enacted (if their Vote had carried it); First, that the Bishops should have no Voices in Parliament; Secondly, that they should not be Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners for the Peace, or Judges in any Temporal Courts; And that they should not fit in the <hi>Star-chamber</hi> nor be Privy Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors. Which Bill being Voted part by part; The two last parts were passed, by a general consent, not above one or two dissenting: But the first branch was carried in the Negative by such an Unison consent in the Lords then present, that if the Bishops had not Voted in defence of themselves, the Temporal Lords alone who appeared for them, had carried it by sixteen Voices. The point being still upon debate, those Lords which had shewed themselves against the Bishops, resolved to put it to the Fortune of another day, protesting that the Former manner of Voting the said Bill by <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> was both <hi>Vnparliamentary</hi> and <hi>Illegal</hi>; and therefore that the <hi>Bill</hi> was either <hi>wholly</hi> to be passed, or ejected <hi>wholly</hi>: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condescended to, the whole <hi>Bill</hi> was utterly cast out of the House by so many voices, that the Bishops might have spared their own till another time. And though according to the Rules of all former Parliaments that a Bill which had been once cast out of the House, should never be prest again the same Session; yet this Bill found a way to it within few moneths after, and almost twelve years before the end of this Session, as we shall see too soon in the course of this History. In the mean time, the <hi>Anti-Prelatical</hi> party in the house of Peers so bestirred themselves, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon the Rest to put a lower valuation on the Bishops then they had done formerly; insomuch, that at a Solemn Fast following not long after, the Temporal Lords took Precedence of the Bishops, contrary to the Custom of their Predecessors in all times foregoing: the Bishops not thinking it convenient to contend for place, at such time as their whole <hi>Order</hi> was in danger of <hi>Falling.</hi> Which being observed by the Lord <hi>Spencer; Is this,</hi> said he, <hi>a day of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein we shew so great a Pride, in taking place of those to whom it was allowed by all our Ancestors</hi>?

Which Earls together with the Earl of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Kimbolton</hi> (eldest Son to the Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi>) were taken at this time into his Majesties Council, that they might witness to the Rest of that Party, with what sincerity and Piety his Majesties Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were Governed at the Council Table. And in Relation to this purpose the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> delivered to the King the <hi>Treasurers Staff,</hi> the Earl of <hi>New-castle</hi> relinquished the Governance of the Prince, and the Lord <hi>Cottington</hi> resigned his Offices both in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and the Court of <hi>Wards,</hi> there being no doubt but that Bishop <hi>Duppa</hi> in Order to so good a work, would relinquish the Tutorship of the Prince, when it should be required of him: So gallantly did these great persons <hi>deny themselves,</hi> to advance the <hi>Service of their Master.</hi> But before all these things were fully set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled and performed, the Kings mind was altered, (but by whom altered, hath been more conjectured then affirmed for certain) which so exasperated them who were concerned in this designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they persued the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> with the great eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.

For finding that their proofs amounted not to a <hi>Legal Evidence</hi>; and that nothing but <hi>Legal Evidence,</hi> could prevail in a Court of Judicature, they Resolved to Steer their course by another wind, and to call the <hi>Legislative</hi> power to their assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; according unto which both <hi>Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by the Light of their own Understanding without further Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony. And so it was declared by <hi>Saint-Iohns</hi> then Solicitor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in a conference between the Committees of both Houses, <hi>April</hi> 29. 1641. Where it is said, <hi>That although single Testimony <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

have been satisfactory in a judicial way, where forms of Law are more to be stood upon, was not so clear; whereas in this way of Bill, private satisfaction to each mans Conscience, is sufficient, although no Evidence had been given in at all.</hi> Thus they Resolved it in this Case; But knowing of what dangerous consequence it might be to the Lives, and Fortunes of themselves and the Rest of Subjects, a <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> clause was added to the Bill of <hi>Attainder,</hi> that it should not be drawn into Example for the time to come. By which it was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, <hi>That no Iudge or Iudges, Iustice or Iustices whatsoever, shall adjudge or Interpret any Act or thing to be Treason, nor hear or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any Treason, nor in any other manner, then he or they should or ought to have done before the making of this Act, and as if this Act had never been made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Majesty understanding how things were carried, Resolved to use his best endeavours to preserve the man, who had deserved so bravely of him. And therefore in a Speech to both Houses of Parliament on the first of <hi>May,</hi> absolved him from all Treasons charged upon him; conjuring them by the merit of his former gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the hopes of greater, not to compel him to do any thing against his conscience, to which no worldly consideration whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, should be able to tempt him. This put the Lords to such a stand, who were before enclinable enough to that unfortunate Gentleman, that multitudes of the Rabble were brought down out of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Southwark,</hi> to cry for speedy Justice, and Execution; the names of such as had not voted to the Bill, being posted up in the Palace-yard, by the Title of <hi>Straffordians,</hi> and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Commonwealth. Which course so terrified the Lords, that most of them withdrawing themselves from the House of Peers, the <hi>Attainder</hi> passed, and certain Bishops nominated to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the King, for satisfying his Conscience, and perswading him to sign that Destructive Bill. Never was Poor Prince, brought to so sad an Exigent, betwixt his Conscience on the one side, and the Fears of such a Publick Rupture on the other, as seemed to threaten nothing but destruction to himself and his Family. But humane frailty, and the continual Solicitation of some about him; so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed at last, that on Munday morning the ninth of <hi>May,</hi> he put a most unwilling hand to that fatal Bill, Issuing a Commission unto certain Lords to pass the same into an Act, and with the same to speed another (which he had also signed with the same Penful of Ink) for the continuance of the present Parliament during the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Houses. The Act thus past on Munday Morning, the Earl was brought unto the Scaffold on the Wednesday following, desiring earnestly, but in vain, to Exchange some words with the Archbishop before his Death; Which gave occasion to a report, that a little before his Death he had charged his misfortunes, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights and misdemeanours upon the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as the Prime Author of the same; and had bitterly Curst the day of their

The Primate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving delivered the Message without delay, the Archbishop replied, That in conscience he was bound to the first, and in duty and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the second: but he feared his weakness and passion would not lend him eyes to behold his last Departure. The next morning at his coming forth he drew near to the Archbishops Lodging, and said to the Lieutenant, Though I do not see the Archbishop, yet give me leave I pray you to do my last observance towards his Rooms. In the mean time the Archbishop, advertised of his approach, came out to the Window; Then the Earl bowing himself to the ground, My Lord (said he) <hi>your Prayers and your Blessing.</hi> The Archbishop lift up his hands, and bestowed both: but overcome with grief, fell to the ground <hi>in Animi deliquio.</hi> The Earl bowing the second time, said, Farewell my Lord, God protect your Innocency.

                  <p>Thus march'd this Great Man to the Scaffold; more like a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Tower desired him to take Coach, for fear the People should rush in upon him and tear him in pieces. No (said he to the Lieutenant) I dare look Death in the face, and I hope the People too; Have you a care that I do not escape, and I care not how I die, whether by the hand of the Executioner, or the madness and fury of the People; If that may give them better content, it is all one to me.

                     </gap> for destroying the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> there was a Clause which
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:54785:244"/>
took away the Coercive power of Bishops, Chancellors, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, and all other Ecclesiastical Judges. To these two last (the Royal Assent having been passed unto all the former without any difficulty) the King was pleased to demur, which bred such a heat amongst the Commons, that he was forced on <hi>Munday</hi> the fifth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> (being but two daies after his passing of the other) to make an excuse for this small delay; the business being of such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as the Altering in a great measure those Fundamental Laws, both <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Civil,</hi> which so many of his Predecessors had established. How great a blow was given by the first Act to the Royal Authority I leave to be considered by our Civil Historians. What the Church suffered by the second will appear by these words, in which it was Enacted (under the several penalties therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained)
<q>That from the fifth day of <hi>August</hi> then next following no Archbishop, or Bishops, or any other Person or Persons, having or exercising any Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction under the Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, within the Realm of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> should award, impose or inflict any Pain, Penalty, Fine, Amercement, Imprisonment, or any Corporal Punishment for any Contempt, Misdemeanour, Crime, Offence, Matter, or Thing whatsoever, belonging to Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Cognizance or Jurisdiction; or should <hi>Ex Officio,</hi>

Which in effect was to take away the Power of Ecclesiastical Censures, belonging naturally and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to the Episcopal Function, that is to say, Suspensions, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, Deprivations, and Degradations, (all which are both inflicted and renounced as Pains or Penalties) to the no small en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Inconformity, Incontinency, and all other irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Courses, both in Clergy and Laity, because it nourisht an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of impunity in the hearts of those who formerly had been awed respectively by those several Censures. For when the Subject fears neither Pain nor Penalty, the Superiour under whom he lives will find little obedience, and the Laws much less.</p>
                  <p>But we have too long left our Archbishop in his cares and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and therefore must return to ease him of some part of his cares, though his sorrows continued as before. Hitherto he had given himself no improbable hopes of being called unto his Trial, and given such strong proof of his integrity and innocence from the Crimes objected, as might restore him to a capacity of doing those good offices to the University as that place of <hi>Chancellor</hi> did require. But finding by the late proceedings of the Houses of Parliament in the business of his dear Friend the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> that his affairs
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:54785:245"/>
were like to grow from bad to worse, he would no longer undergo the name of that Office which he was not able to perform. Resolved to put the University into such a condition as might enable them to proceed in the choice of a more fortunate Patron, he acquaints the King with his intent by the Bishop of <hi>London</hi>; and finding his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Concurrence in opinion with him, he sends his Resignation in his Letter of <hi>Iune</hi> 28. Which being published, and excepted in the Convocation of the University on <hi>Iuly</hi> 1.

                  <p>This Resignation having eased him of some part of his cares, it was no small refreshment to him in the midst of his sorrows, that notwithstanding all the clamour about <hi>Innovations,</hi> the Parliament
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:54785:245"/>
had made no Order to alter any thing which he had laboured to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish. The Commons might perhaps have some thoughts that way, but they either kept them to themselves, or found but little comfort in them when they suffered them to go abroad, or shew themselves in any motion to the House of Lords. The Peers were then so far from entertaining any such extravagant Fancies, that taking notice of the Irregular Zeal of some forward men, who had not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience enough to attend the leisure of Authority, they joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Prelates, in this Order of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 16. for putting a stop to their Exorbitancies at the first breaking out. For by that Order it was signified to be the pleasure of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal assembled in the High Court of Parliament,
<q>That the Divine Service be performed as it is appointed by the Acts of Parliament of this Realm: And that all such as shall disturb that wholsom Order, shall be severely punished according to the Law: And the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Vicars, and Curates in the several Parishes shall forbear to introduce any Rites or Ceremonies that may give offence, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than those which are established by the Laws of the Land.</q>
Which last Clause being couched in such general terms, related only to such Rites and Ceremonies, as otherwise might have been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for the time to come, not unto such as had been entertained and settled by any former Authority. Countenanced and secured by which Declaration, the Ordinaries went on chearfully in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of their Jurisdiction, suffering no alteration or disturbance to pass unquestioned, if any troublesome or unquiet person did begin to stir. But no sooner was the Coercive power of Bishops and other Ecclesiastical Judges restrained, or rather utterly abolished, by the late Act of Parliament; and the Kings Journey into <hi>Scotland</hi> left men and matters at more liberty than before they were: but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently the House of Commons took upon them such a Reformation (so it must be called) in which they neither found concurrence of the House of Peers, or could expect it from the King. But finding that they were strong enough to set up for themselves, without work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Journey-work any longer unto either of them, they made the following Order of <hi>September</hi> 8. to be the first Experiment or Essay of their undertakings. For though in a Conference, had the same day with the Lords, they desired their consent therein, and that the Lords returned them no other Answer than by sending them the next day (being the day of the Recess) a Copy of the former Order of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 16. in which they desired then to concur; yet <hi>Pym,</hi> who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the Committee during that Recess, dispatcht his Mandate o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They had gratified the Commons in procuring all the Acts of Parliament before remembred, and paring the Bishops nails to the very quick, by the only terrour of their Arms; and were reciprocally gratified by them with a gift of three hundred thousand pounds of good English money, in the name of a <hi>brotherly assistance,</hi> for their pretended former losses, which could not rationally be computed to the tenth part of that Sum. And in relation to that Treaty they gained in a manner all those points which had been first insisted on in the meeting at <hi>Rippon,</hi> and many addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionals also, which were brought in afterwards by <hi>London.</hi> In their <hi>Demand</hi> concerning Unity in Religion, and Uniformity in Church-Government, the Answer savoured rather of delay than satisfaction; amounting to no more than this,

time performed irreverently and perfunctorily in the Cathedrals of those Cities, for want of the Bishops Residence and Superinspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That they had transferred the solemn giving of <hi>Orders</hi> from the said Cathedrals, to the Chappels of their private Houses, or some obscure Churches in the Country, not having nor requiring the Assistance of their Deans and Chapters, as they ought to do; That they engrossed a sole or solitary Power to themselves alone, in the Sentence of Deprivation and Degradation, without the Presences and Consents of their said Deans and Chapters, or any Members of the same, contrary to the <hi>Canons</hi> in that behalf; by which last Acts they had rendred those Capitular Bodies as useless to the Church as they were themselves: And finally, That seeing they did nothing which belonged unto the place of a Bishop, but the receiving of their Rents, living in ease and worldly pomp, and domineering over the rest of their Brethren, it was expedient to remove the Function out of the Church, and turn their Lands and Houses unto better uses. This I remember to have been the substance of those Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions made by some of the Gentry, and put into the mouths of the Common People; in which if any thing were true (as I hope there was not) such Bishops as offended in the Premises, or in any of them, have the less reason to complain of their own misfortunes, and the more cause to be complained of, for giving such Advantages to the Enemies of their Power and Function. Nor was the aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their Lands and Houses the Total Sum of the Design, though a great part of it. As long as the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Jurisdiction stood, much <hi>Grist</hi> was carried from the <hi>Mills</hi> in <hi>Westminster-Hall, Toll</hi> whereof was taken by the Bishops Officers; Therefore those Courts to be suppressed (which could not be more easily done, than in abolishing the Bishops whose Courts they were) that so the managing of all Causes, both <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Civil,</hi> might be brought into the hands of those who thought they could not thrive sufficiently by their own <hi>Common Law,</hi> as long as any other <hi>Law</hi> was <hi>Common,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their own. By means whereof, all Offices and Preferments in the Admiral, Archiepiscopal, and Diocesan Courts, being taken from the Civil Lawyers, nothing can follow thereupon but the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and discontinuance of those Noble Studies, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly were found so advantagious to the State and Nation.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be thought that such a general Concussion should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal the Church, so many Practices entertained against it, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Endeavours used for the Ruine of it; and that no man should lend a helping hand to support the Fabrick, or to uphold the Sacred Ark when he saw it tottering. Some well-affected in both Houses, appeared stoutly for it; amongst which, none more cordially than the Lord <hi>George Digby,</hi> in a Speech made upon occasion of the City-Petition, and Sir <hi>Lucius Cary</hi> Viscount <hi>Faulkland,</hi> both Members of the House of Commons: Which last, though he expressed much bitterness against the Bishops, in one of his Speeches made in the
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:54785:251"/>
first heats and agitation of business; yet afterwards in another of them he shewed himself an especial Advocate in behalf of the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Order. In which Speech of his it is affirmed,
<q>That the ground of this Government by Episcopacy is so ancient, and so general, so uncontradicted in the first and best times that our most laborious Antiquaries can find no Nation, no City, no Church, no Houses under any other, that our first Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Authors tell us of; That the Apostles not only allowed but founded Bishops, so that the Tradition for some Books of Scripture, which we receive as Canonical, is both less ancient, less general, and less uncontradicted than that is.</q>
So he when he was come again to his former temper, and not yet entred nor initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Court preferments. Nor was the point only canvased with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in those walls, but managed in a more publick way by the Pens of some, than there it had been tossed on the Tongues of others. The Bishop of <hi>Exon.</hi> leads the way, presenting <hi>An humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance</hi> to the High Court of Parliament in behalf of <hi>Liturgie</hi> and <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> which presently was encountred with an answer to it, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Answer framed by a Juncto of five Presbyterian Ministers in or about the City of <hi>London,</hi> the first Letters of whose names being laid together made up the word <hi>Smectymnuus,</hi> which appears only for the Author.

Next for the <hi>Vacancies</hi> in the Church they were supplied by preferring <hi>Williams,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> to the See of <hi>York</hi>; and <hi>Winiff,</hi> Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> to the See of <hi>Lincoln; Duppa</hi> of <hi>Chichester,</hi> to <hi>Salisbury</hi>; and <hi>King,</hi> then Dean of <hi>Rochester,</hi> to succeed at <hi>Chichester; Hall,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Exon.</hi> translated to <hi>Norwich</hi>; and <hi>Brownrigg,</hi> Master of <hi>Catharine</hi> Hall in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> preferred to <hi>Exon.

Nor were there more Changes after these, till the suppressing of Episcopacy by the Ordinance of the Lords and Commons, bearing date <hi>October</hi> 9. <hi>anno</hi> 1646. but that <hi>Frewen,</hi> Dean of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and President of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxon.</hi> was consecrated Bishop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Lichfield</hi> on the death of <hi>Wright,</hi> in the beginning of the year 1644. and <hi>Howel,</hi> one of the Prebends of <hi>Windsor,</hi> and Chaplain in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to his Majesty, was preferred to the Bishoprick of <hi>Bristol</hi> on the death of <hi>Westfield,</hi> before the end of the same year.</p>
                  <p>The passing of this Act forementioned,<note place="margin">1642.</note> put the imprisoned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in some hope of a speedy deliverance, though it proved not so quick as they expected. For though on <hi>Munday February</hi> 14. an Order came that they might put in bail if they would, that they should have their hearing on the <hi>Friday</hi> following, and that some
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:54785:252"/>
of them went out of the <hi>Tower</hi> the morrow after, as appears by <hi>Breviate,</hi> fol. 25. yet the Commons took it so indignly, that either that Order was revoked, or the Bishops had some private Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement to return and continue where they were. The Bishops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deprived of their right of Peerage, must be supposed to stand on the same ground with the rest of the People; and consequently to be accountable for their Actions to the House of Commons, whose Priviledges, if the Peers invade, they must look to hear of it, as well as the poor Bishops had done before. And on these terms the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness stood till <hi>May</hi> 5. being just eighteen weeks from their first Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment; at which time, without making suite to the House of Commons, the Peers releast them upon baile, and dismist them to their several dwellings. There they continued all of them at their own disposing, till the War forced them to provide themselves of safer quarters, except the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> only, who, within few months after he was discharged from the Tower, was seised on by a party of Souldiers at his house of <hi>Douwham,</hi> and brought back again to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he continued till the end of the year 1659. without any Charge or Accusation produced against him.</p>
                  <p>But as for the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as he first took possession of that Fatal Lodging before any of the rest came to him; so he continued there after their dismission, without hope of finding his passage out of it by any other door than the door of Death: which as he did not look for before it came, so when it came he did not fear it. He had then been fifteen months a Prisoner since his first Commitment to that place, as far from being brought unto his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al as he was at the first; and is to lye there as much longer before he should hear any thing of them which might tend that way: only they had some pulls at him from one time to another, to keep him in remembrance of his present condition, and to prepare him by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to his last dissolution. For on <hi>October</hi> 23. in the year foregoing, the House of Peers sequestred his Jurisdiction from him, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it on <hi>Brent,</hi> and others of his under-officers; and ordered that he should bestow none of the Benefices within his gift without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting them with the name and quality of the party whom he intended to prefer, leaving to them the Approbation, if they saw cause for it. And on <hi>October</hi> 15. this present year, for so long he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without further disturbance, it was resolved upon the Question, That the Fines, Rents, and Profits of Archbishops and Bishops, should be sequestred for the use and service of the Commonwealth. In which though he was no more concerned, yet he was as much concerned as any other of the Episcopal Order; so much the more, as being sure to find less favour, whensoever that Vote should be put in execution by them that made it. For on the ninth of <hi>November</hi> following, his house at <hi>Lambeth</hi> was forcibly possessed by a Party of Souldiers to keep it for the publick Service, and 78 pounds of his
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:54785:252"/>
Rents as forcibly taken from some of his Officers, by an Order un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hands of some of the Lords upon pretence of imploying it to the maintenance of his Majesties Children. But upon his Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, shortly after he had an Order for securing of his Goods and Books, though he secured them rather from the power of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers than from the hands of any other on whom the Houses should bestow them, when they saw time for it. Upon the neck of that came another Order to bar him from having Conference with any of the other Prisoners; or speaking with any other, but in the presence of the Warder who was appointed to attend him; and from having the Liberty of the Tower; or from sending any of his Servants into the City but on occasion of providing Victuals, and other necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Not long after, the Souldiers brake open the doors of his Chappel in <hi>Lambeth</hi> house, and began to make foul work with the Organs there: but before any great hurt was done, their Captain came, and put a period to their fury. On <hi>December</hi> 21. his Saddle-horse was seised on by Order from some Members in the House of Commons; and on 23. <hi>Leighton</hi> the Schismatick, who had before been sentenced in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> for his libellous and seditious Pamphlets, came with an Order from that house to disposses the Souldiers of their quarters there, and turn his house into a Prison. His Wood and Coals seised on, without any permission to make any use of them for himself. On <hi>March</hi> 14. he had word brought him of a plot for sending him and Bishop <hi>Wren,</hi> his fellow Prisoner to perpetual Exile in <hi>New-England</hi>; and that <hi>Wells,</hi> a factious Preacher, which came lately thence, had laid wagers of it: but when the matter came in agitation in the House of Commons, it appeared to be so horrible and foul a practice, that it was generally rejected. In the beginning of <hi>May</hi> 1643 the Windows in his Chappel were defaced, and the steps torn up; his Goods and Books seised on by <hi>Leighton,</hi> and some others. And on the sixteenth of the same month he was ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with an Order of both Houses, debarring him from bestowing any of his Benefices, which either were or should be vacant for the time to come. And on the last day of the same an Order issued from some Members of that close Committee, directed unto <hi>Prynne</hi> and others, to seise on all his Letters and Papers, to be perused by such as should be Authorised to that end and purpose.</p>
                  <p>So far they had proceeded in pulling him from himself piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, before they were ready for his Trial, or seemed to have any thoughts which might look that way. They had then a greater game to play, and on this occasion. His Majesty at his late being in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> expostulated with some of the chief amongst them touching their late coming into <hi>England</hi> in an hostile manner, and found that some who were now leading men in the Houses of Parliament had invited them to it; and having furnished himself with some proofs for it, he commanded his Atturney General to impeach some of them of High Treason; that is to say, the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> a
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:54785:253"/>
Member of the House of Peers, <hi>Hollis, Pym, Hasterig, Stroud,</hi> and <hi>Hambden,</hi> of the House of Commons. But sending a Serjeant at Arms to Arrest their persons, there came a countermand from the House of Commons, by which the Serjeant was deferred from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his office, and the Members had the opportunity of putting themselves into the Sanctuary of the City. The next day, being <hi>Ianuary</hi> 4. his Majesty being no otherwise attended than with his ordinary Servants, and some few Gentlemen, armed no otherwise than with Swords and Courage, went to the House of Commons to demand the five Members, that he might proceed against them in a way of Justice; but his intention was discovered, and the birds flown before his coming. And this was voted by the House of Commons for such an unexpiable breach of Priviledge, that neither t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This presently Voted by both Houses to be a leavying of War against the Parliament, for whose defence not only the <hi>Trained Bands</hi> of <hi>London</hi> must be in readiness, and the <hi>Good people of the Country</hi> required to put themselves into a posture of Arms; but Regiments of Horse and Food are Listed, a General appointed, great Summs of Mony raised, and all this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of taking the King out of the hands of his <hi>Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors.</hi> The noise of these preparations hastens the King from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Notingham</hi> where he sets up his <hi>Standard</hi> inviting all his good <hi>Subjects</hi> to repair unto him, for defence of their King, the Laws and Religion of their Country, He encreased his forces as he marched, which could not come unto the Reputation of being an Army, till he came into <hi>Shropshire,</hi> where great Bodies of the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and Stout hearted <hi>Welch</hi> resorted to him. Strengthened with this, and furnished sufficiently with field Pieces, Arms, and Ammunition, which the Queen had sent to him out of <hi>Holland,</hi> he resolves upon his March to <hi>London</hi>; but on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 23<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Octob.</hi> was encountred on the way at a place called <hi>Edghill</hi> by the Parliaments Forces. The Fight very terrible for the time, no fewer then 5000 men slain upon the place; The <hi>Prologue</hi> for a greater slaughter, if the Dark night had not put an end to that dispute. Each part pretended the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, but it went cleerly on the Kings side, who though he lost his General; yet he kept the Field, and possessed himself of the Dead bodies, and not so only: but he made his way open unto <hi>London,</hi> and in his way forced <hi>Banbury</hi> Castle in the very sight, as it were, of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> who with his flying Army made all the hast he could toward the City (that he might be there before the King) to serve the Parliament. More certain signs there could not be of an absolute victory. In the battel of <hi>Turo,</hi> between the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> it happened so, that the Confederates kept the Field, possest themselves of the Camp, Baggage and Artillery, which the <hi>French</hi> in their breaking through, had left behind them. And yet the Honour of the day was generally given unto the <hi>French</hi>; For though they lost the Field, their Camp Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery and Baggage: yet they obtained what they fought for, which was the opening of their way to <hi>France,</hi> and which the <hi>Confederates</hi> did intend to deprive them off. Which Resolution in that <hi>Case</hi> may be a Ruling <hi>Case</hi> to this; the King having not only kept the Field, possest himself of the dead bodies, Pillaged the Carriages of the Enemy: but forcibly opened his way toward <hi>London,</hi> which the Enemy endeavoured to hinder, and finally entred Triumphantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Oxon,</hi> with no fewer then one hundred and twenty Colours ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Yet he goes forward notwithstanding as far as <hi>Brainford,</hi> out of which he beats two of their best Regiments, takes 500 Prisoners, sinks their <hi>Ordnance,</hi> with an intent to march forward on the morrow after, being <hi>Sunday November</hi> 13. But understanding that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had drawn his Forces out of <hi>Kingston,</hi> and joyning with the <hi>London Auxiliaries,</hi> lay in the way before him, at a place called <hi>Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hom-Green</hi> neer <hi>Chiswick,</hi> it was thought safer to retreat toward <hi>Oxon.</hi> while the way was open, than to venture his Army to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of a second Battel, which if it were lost, it would be utterly impossible for him to raise another. At <hi>Oxon.</hi> he receives <hi>Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of Peace from the Houses of Parliament: but such as rather did beseem a conquering than a losing side: Amongst which I find this for one.

<q>That divers of the Clergy, eminent for their Piety and Learning, were forced from their Cures and Habitations, or otherwise silenced and discharged from exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising their Ministry, for no other reason but because (contrary to the Laws of the Land, and their own Consciences) they would not pray against him and his Assistants, or refused to publish any ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Commands and Orders for fomenting the unnatural War rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against him: but conformed themselves according to the Book of Common Prayers, and Preach'd Gods Word according to the purity thereof, without any mixture of Sedition. Next, That the said Clergy being so forcibly driven out or discharged of their Cures, many Factious and Schismatical Persons were intruded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, to sow Sedition, and seduce his good Subjects from their Obedience, contrary to the Word of God and the Laws of the Land: Part of the Profits of the said Benefices allotted to the said Intruders; the rest converted to the Maintenance of the War against him. And thereupon he streightly commandeth all his good Subjects to desist from such illegal courses against any of the Clergy aforesaid; to pay their Tythes to the several and respective Incumbents, or their Assigns, without guile or fraud, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any Sequestration, pretended Orders or Ordinances what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, from one or both Houses of Parliament; and this to do, under pain of being proceeded against according to Law, as they should be apprehended and brought to the hands of Justice; their Lands and Goods in the mean time to be sequestred, and taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this served rather to declare his Majesties Piety, than to stop the course of those Proceedings: For justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, the Clergy must be branded with Offences of divers conditions; some of them of such a scandalous and heynous nature, as were not to be expiated with the loss of Livings, but of Lives, if
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:54785:256"/>
any Legal Evidence had been found to prove them. And that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be wanting to their infelicity, an infamous Pamphlet is dispersed, Licenced by <hi>White</hi> Chairman for the Committee for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, under the Title of, <hi>The first Century of Scandalous and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Priests, &amp;c.</hi> Which though his Majesty abominated upon very good reason, when it first came unto his knowledge; yet would he not give way that a Recrimination should be made of the adverse Party, by such as undertook to do it on far juster grounds.</p>
                  <p>In like manner they proceeded to the execution of another part of their design, mentioned and presented in the said Proposition, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Consultation to be had with Godly, Religious, and Learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</hi> For not intending to expect his Majesties pleasure, their Commissioners were no sooner returned from the Treaty at <hi>Oxon.</hi> but they caused such an Assembly to be called by their own Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as should be sure to do the Work recommended to them. The <hi>Convocation</hi> was in force, but not fit to be trusted; nor durst they venture to commit the choice of men to the Beneficed Clergy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the course of <hi>National</hi> and <hi>Provincial Synods</hi>: That Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they kept unto themselves, committing the Nomination unto such as served for the several Counties, that so each County might be furnished with such Persons to perform the Service, as could have no Authority to bind them by their Constitutions, or any other Publick Acts, made and agreed upon in that <hi>Assembly.</hi> An <hi>Assembly</hi> of a very strange mixture, consisting of a certain number of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> with a greater proportion of <hi>Divines,</hi> some of which were <hi>Prelatical,</hi> some <hi>Independent,</hi> and the greater part of them <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> out of which spawned another Fry by the name of <hi>Erastians.</hi> And that they might not be bound to this Journey-work without daily Wages, they had each of them their 4 <hi>s. per diem</hi> well and truly paid, and were besides invested in several Lectures in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the best Benefices (some of them three or four for failing) which could be found in all the Kingdom. His Majesty looks on this as a new Provocation, a strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd Incroachment on his Royal Prerogative, to which alone the calling of such <hi>Assemblies</hi> did belong by the Laws of the Realm. He sees withal the dangerous ends for which it was called, of what Ingredients for the most part the whole <hi>Assembly</hi> was composed, what influence the prevailing party in both Houses was to have upon it, and the sad consequents which in all probability were to be expected from it to the Church and State. And thereupon by his Proclamation of <hi>Iune</hi> 22. (being just ten days after the date of the Ordinance by which the <hi>Assembly</hi> was indicted)
<q>He inhibits all and every Person named in that pretended Ordinance (under seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pains) from assembling together for the end and purpose therein set down;<note place="margin">

But being returned to <hi>Oxford</hi> (with Success and Honour) he Summons the Lords and Commons of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to attend there on <hi>Ianuary</hi> 22. then next following, and they came accordingly.

Duke of <hi>York,</hi> by which name he had been appointed to be called at the time of his Birth, that they might Sit and Vote amongst them. But being come, they neither would take upon themselves the name of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> nor acted much in order to his Majesties Designs: but stood so much upon their terms, and made so many unhandsom Motions to him upon all occasions, that he had more reason to call them <hi>A Mongrel Parliament,</hi> in one of his Letters to the Queen, than they were willing to allow of.</p>
                  <p>Scarce were they settled in their several and respective Houses, when they were entertained with a hot Alarm, made by the coming in of the <hi>Scots</hi> with a puissant Army; the greatest and best accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with all sorts of Arms and Ammunition, that ever was mustered by that Nation, since it had a being. His Majesties won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Successes in the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> strook such a terrour in the prevailing Party of both Houses, that they were forced to cast themselves upon the <hi>Scots</hi> for Support and Succour; dispatching <hi>Armine,</hi> and some other of their active Members, to negotiate a new Confederacy with them. The <hi>Scots</hi> had thrived so w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But knowing well in what necessity their <hi>dear Brethren</hi> in <hi>England</hi> stood of their assistance, they were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to <hi>make Hay</hi> while the <hi>Sun shined,</hi> and husband that necessity to their best advantage. The <hi>English</hi> must first enter into Covenant with them, for conforming of this Church with that; They must be flattered with the hopes of dividing the Bishops Lands amongst them, that they might plant themselves in some of the fairest Houses and best Lands of this Kingdom; So great a stroke is to be given them in the Government of all Affairs, that the Houses could act nothing in order to the present War, no not so much as to hold a Treaty with the King, without the consent of their Commissioners; Some of their Ministers (<hi>Gillespie, Henderson, &amp;c.</hi>) with as many of their <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Walls of some
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:54785:258"/>
Confederacies, like that of <hi>Catiline,</hi> are never thought to be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently well built but when they are cemented with bloud.</p>
                  <p>All matters thus resolved on, the Covenant agreed on betwixt them and the <hi>Scots</hi> was solemnly taken by both Houses in St. <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets</hi> Church, and generally imposed upon all such as were obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their power, and lived under the command of their Forts and Garrisons: the taking whereof conduced as visibly to the destruction of this most reverend and renowned Prelate, as to the present sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Government, and Liturgy here by Law established. In the first branch it was to be covenanted and agreed between the Nations (that is to say, between the <hi>Puritan</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in either Kingdom)
<q>That all endeavours should be used for the preservation of the Reformed Religion in the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> both in Doctrine, Worship, Liturgy, and Government; and for bringing the three Kingdoms to the nearest Conjunction, and Uniformity in Religion, Confession of Faith, Form of Church-Government, <hi>Directory</hi> for Worship and Catechising. And in the second, That in like manner they endeavour without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Persons, the extirpation of <hi>Popery,</hi> Prelacy, that is, Church-Government by Archbishops and Bishops, their Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors or Commissaries, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, and all other Ecclesiastical Officers depending on the Hierarchy, Superstition, Heresie, Schism, Profaneness, and what soever should be found contrary to sound Doctrine, and the power of Godliness.</q>
But all this might have been pursued to the end of the Chace without danger to the life of any, whether they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured it or not, whether their lives might be an hindrance, or their deaths give a spur to put on the work. And therefore in the fourth place it was also Covenanted,
<q>That they should with all diligence and faithfulness discover all such as have been, or shall be Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries, Malignants, or evil Instruments, by hindring the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Religion, dividing the King from his People, or one of the Kingdoms from one another, or making any Faction or Parties amongst the People contrary to this League and Covenant, that they may be brought to publick trial, and receive condign punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the degree of their offences shall require or deserve, or the supream Judicatories of both Kingdoms respectively, or others having power from them for that effect, shall judge conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</q>
Which Article seems to have been made to no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose but to bring the Archbishop to the Block, as the like clause was thrust into the <hi>Protestation</hi> of the third of <hi>May, Anno</hi> 1641. to make sure work with the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> whom they had then designed to the said sad end. And this may be the rather thought because the Covenant was contrived, and framed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where none but his sworn Enemies could be supposed to have had any hand in it; and being by them so contrived was swallowed without much enewing by the Houses of Parliament, who were not then in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Prosecuted in all places, with such cursed rigour, that all such who refused to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the same, and to lift up their hands to God in testimony that they called him to witness to it, were turned both out of house and home, as they use to say, not suffered to compound for their Goods or Lands till they had submitted thereunto. A terrible and wofull time, in which men were not suffered to enjoy their Estates without betraying themselves to the Kings displeasure, and making ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of a good conscience in the sight of God.

of Suspension, &amp;c.</q>
10. That a Vote having been passed at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Table a little before the last Parliment, for supplying his Majesty in Extraordinary ways, if the said Parliament should <hi>prove peevish,</hi> he wickedly advised his Majesty to dissolve the same, telling him not long after, that now he was absolved from all Rules of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and left free to use Extraordinary ways for his supply. Such was the substance of the Charge, which some intended Chiefly for an Introduction to bring on the Tryal, or to revive the noise and clamor amongst Ignorant People which rather judge of such parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars by tale then weight: For otherwise there is nothing in these last ten, which was not easily reducible to the first fourteen, no not so much as his suppressing the <hi>Feoffees</hi> for <hi>Impropriations,</hi> which seemed most odious in the eyes of any knowing men.</p>
                  <p>These Articles being thus digested, were sent up to the Lords the 23<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Octob.</hi> presented by the hands of <hi>Wilde,</hi> a Serjeant at Law, and one of the Members of the House of Commons, by whom he was designed to manage the Evidence, when the cause was Ready for a hearing; on the Receipt whereof it was Ordered that he should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on that day Sevennight, and to bring in his answer in writing to the particular Articles of the several charges: which Order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing served upon him, within few hours after found him not very well provided for a present conformity. He had obtained leave at his first Commitment to repair to his Study at <hi>Lambeth</hi> House, and to take thence such Papers and Memorials as might conduce to his defence; but all these had been forcibly seazed on, and in a manner ravisht from him by <hi>Prynne</hi> and others, which made his case not much unlike to that of the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the House of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, deprived first of their former allowance of Straw and Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and yet injoyned to make up their <hi>whole tale of Brick,</hi> as at other times. His Rents, and Goods were Sequestred for the use of others, so that he had not a sufficiency for a poor Subsistence, but by the Charity of his Friends; much less a superabundance, out of which to Fee his Counsel and reward his Solicitors. And what were seven days to the drawing up of an Answer unto twenty four Articles, most of them having young ones in their bellies also, as like to make as Loud a cry as the Dams themselves. No way to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate himself out of this perplexities but by petitioning the Lords, and to them he flys, humbly beseeching, that <hi>Chute</hi> and <hi>Hearn</hi> two able Lawyers might be assigned him for his Counsel; that he might be allowed money out of his own Estate to reward them and others for their pains in his business; his Books and Papers restored to him, for the instruction of his Counsel, and his own Defence; some of his own Servants to attend him for following all such necessary occasions, as the cause required; and that a Solicitor, and further time might be allowed, as well for drawing up his answer as providing witnesses, To which this Answer was returned.

Sir <hi>William Webb</hi> my Kinsman, and two of his Daughters; and his Son I took from him, and his Father being utterly decayed, I bred him at my own charge: and he is a very good Protestant. A Gentleman brought to me by Mr. <hi>Chesford,</hi> his Majesties Servant, but I cannot recall his name. The <hi>Lord Mayo</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> brought to me also by Mr. <hi>Chesford.</hi> The Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> almost quite gone between the Lady his Mother and Sister.

the Villages adjoyning; but he Resolved not to forsake his Cannon upon any occasion. At which when some about him seemed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and marvelled at the patience which he shewed in that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, his Majesty lifting up his Hat, made Answer, <hi>That as God had given him afflictions to exercise his patience, so he had given him patience to bear his afflictions.</hi> The carriage being mended he went forward again, and trode so close upon the heels of <hi>Essex,</hi> that at last he drave him into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and there reduced him to that point, that he put himself into a <hi>Cock-boat,</hi> with <hi>Stapleton</hi> and some others of his principal Friends, and left his whole Army to his Majesties mercy. His Horse taking the Advantage of a dark night made a shift to escape, but the Commanders of the Foot came to this Capitulation with his Majesty, that they should depart without their Arms, which with their Cannon, Baggage and Ammunition, being of great Consideration, were left wholly to his disposing.</p>
                  <p>Immediately after this success, his Majesty dispatched a message from <hi>Tavestock</hi> to the two Houses of Parliament, in which he laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the miserable Condition of the Kingdom, remembring them of those many Messages which he had formerly sent unto them for an accommodation of the present differences; and now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring them to bethink themselves of some expedient by which this Issue of blood might be dried up, the distraction of the Kingdom settled, and the whole Nation put into an hope of Peace and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. To which message as to many others before, they either gave no Answer, or such an one as rather served to widen then close the breach, falsly conceiving, that all his Majesties offers of Grace and Favour, proceeded either from an inability to hold out the War, or from the weakness and irresolution of his Counsels. But if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s Message from <hi>Tavestock</hi> his Majesty had gone on his own errand, and marched directly toward <hi>London,</hi> it was conceived in all probability that he might have made an end of the War, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the life of the Archbishop his most trusty Servant, and put an end to those calamities which the continuance and conclusion of the War, brought with it. The Army of <hi>Essex</hi> being thus broken, and that of <hi>Manchester</hi> not returned from the <hi>Northern</hi> Service, He could not chuse but have observed in the course of that Action, with what a Military Prudence, <hi>Lesly</hi> had followed at the heels of the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> not stopping or diverting upon the by, till he had brought his Army before <hi>York</hi>; the gaining whereof, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chief City of those parts, brought in all the Rest. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it hath been counted no dishonour in the greatest Souldiers to be instructed by their enemies in the feats of War. But the King sitting down before <hi>Plymouth</hi> (as before <hi>Glocester</hi> the last year) and staying there to perfect an Association of the <hi>Western</hi> Counties, he spent so much time that <hi>Essex</hi> was again in the head of his Army; and being seconded by <hi>Manchester,</hi> and <hi>Waller,</hi> made a stand at <hi>Newbury,</hi>
                     <pb n="524" facs="tcp:54785:265"/>
where after a very sharp dispute, the Enemy gained some of his Majesties <hi>Cannon,</hi> which struck such a terrour into many of those about him, that they advised him to withdraw his Person out of the danger of the Fight, as he did accordingly. But this he did so secretly and with so slender a Retinue, that he was not mist, His Army holding on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight with a greater courage, because they thought the safety of his Majesties Person did depend upon it; whose departure if it had been known, would questionless have created such a general dejection in the hearts of his Souldiers, as would have rendred them to a cheap discomfiture. But the Lost Cannon being regained, and the fight continued with those of his Majesties party with greater advantage then before, each Army drew of by degrees, so that neither of them could find any great cause to boast of the victory.</p>
                  <p>This Summers Action being ended, in which the <hi>Scots</hi> had done very good service to the Houses of Parliament, it was thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to proceed in the Tryal of the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which had taken up so much time already, that it seemed ready for a sentence. But there appeared more difficulty in it, then at first was lookt for. For being admitted to a <hi>Recapitulation</hi> of his whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence before the Lords, in the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> it gave such a general satisfaction to all that heard it, that the mustering up of all the evidence against him would not take it off. To prove the first branch of the charge against him, they had ript up the whole course of his Life, from his first coming to <hi>Oxford,</hi> till his Commitment to the Tower; but could find no sufficient Proof of any design to bring in <hi>Popery,</hi> or suppress the true Protestant Religion here by Law Established. For want whereof, they insisted upon such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches as were laid upon him when he lived in the University, the beautifying of his Chappel Windows with Pictures and Images, the Solemn Consecration of Churches and Chappels, the Placing of the Communion Table Altar-wise, and making Adoration in his Accesses to, or Approches toward it; Administring the Sacrament, with some more Solemnities, then in Ordinary Parochial Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, though constantly observed in his Majesties Chappels; the care and diligence of his Chaplains in expunging some offensive pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages out of such Books, as were to be licenced for the Press, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To the other branches of his Charge, consisting in Words or Actions he answered first, That the Dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the said Parliaments was no Act of his, the business being publickly debated at the Council Table and carried by the Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous consent of all then Present; that the hard measure which he was complained of to have shown to <hi>Corbet</hi> of <hi>Shropshire</hi> (he being but a Private Subject) could not be called an Act of Treason; That the words charged upon him at the Council Table and elswhere, might well have been spared; That no ill effect did follow on them; and that they were innocently though suddenly spoken, which he hoped might proceed from a man of such a hasty, and Incircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect humour as himself (made so as well by nature, as by the multiplicity of vexations which were put upon him) without invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him in the crime or guilt of Treason; That for his words unto the King, touching his being absolved from the Rules of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they contained only matter of opinion, and in opinion deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at the Council Table, where all had Liberty to speak their own sense as he did at time; which if it were Erroneous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the sense of others, he hoped that no man should justly be condemned of Treason, for shewing himself no wiser then God had made him. And thereupon he desired the Lords from his misfortune to provide for their own safety, and seriously to consider what a way
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:54785:266"/>
was chalked out to ruine them, both in their Lives and their Estates, if for every Opinion given in Council, or Words suddenly or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily spoken, they (who are born to wield the great affairs of the Kingdom) should be Arraigned or Sentenced as Traytors. To which he added in the close, That there was no likelyhood that he had commited Real Acts of Treason, when his adverse Party was content to trifle away so much time about Words: Neither was there any Treason in them, though they had been fully verified; and therefore in that (as in all other Articles) he reserved a Power for his Counsel to dispute in matter of Law. Which when it came to the Dispute (not called on by the Commons till <hi>October</hi> 11.) the Question or Point in Issue was, <hi>Whether any</hi> Treason <hi>was contained in all or any of the Articles which were charged against him</hi>? And therein <hi>Hearn</hi> so plaid his part, as the mouth of the rest, that after the expectation of more months, and the expence of almost as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days as had been spent in the Arraignment of the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> his Enemies in the House of Commons were forced to fall again on a Bill of <hi>Attainder,</hi> as they had been before, after so much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ise and ostentation of Wit and Eloquence, in the case of that Gentleman.</p>
                  <p>For being too far engaged to go back with Honour, and yet not having confidence enough to venture him to the Judgment of the House of Peers, as in the way of Legal Tryal, they seemed to be at such a stand, as the <hi>Thames</hi> is said to be at, under <hi>London</hi>-Bridge, betwixt Ebb and Flood. In which perplexity, some who were fit for any mischief, imployed themselves to go from door to door, and from man to man, to get hands against him; and so Petition those to hasten to his Condemnation, who must forsooth be forced to their own desires (whereof, and of the <hi>Magistrates standing still and suffering them to proceed</hi> without any <hi>Check,</hi> he gave them a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento</hi> in his dying Speech) Which Preparations being made, they followed it with such double diligence, that by the beginning of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> most men were great with expectation of a final Sentence; Conceived by some, That the whole Evidence being transmitted with the Prisoner to the Justices of his Majesties Bench, he should have been put over to a <hi>Middlesex-Iury</hi>: but they were only some poor Ignorants which conceived so of it. The Leading Members of the House thought of no such matter; and to say truth, it did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them highly not to go that way. For though there was no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion to be made at all, but that they could have Impanelled a <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to have found the <hi>Bill:</hi> yet by a Clause in the <hi>Attainder</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> they had bound the Judges not to declare those Facts for Treason in the time to come, for which they had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and Executed that Heroick Peer. And therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved on the same course now, which they had found before so prosperous and successful to them, to proceed now as then, by <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Attainder,</hi> and condemn him by Ordinance; in which being
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:54785:266"/>
Parties, Witnesses, and Judges too, they were assured to speed as they would themselves. And though for fashion sake he was brought unto the Commons Bar on the eleventh of that Month, not without magnifying the Favour of giving him leave to shew some Reason, why the Bill should not pass against him: yet was this but a matter of Formality only, the Ordinance passing in that House within two days after.</p>
                  <p>But yet the Business was not done; for the Lords stuck at it: some of which having not extinguished all the <hi>Sparks</hi> of <hi>Humanity,</hi> began to find themselves compassionate of his Condition; not knowing how soon it should or might be made their own, if once disfavoured by the Grandees of that <hi>Potent Faction.</hi> For the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance having been transmitted to the House of Peers, and the House of Peers deliberating somewhat long upon it, it was Voted on <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 4. <hi>That all Books, Writings, and Evidences which concerned the Tryal, should be brought before the Lords in Parliament</hi>; to the end that they might seriously and distinctly consider of all Particulars amongst themselves, as they came before them. But meaning to make sure work of it, they had in the mean time (after no small Evaporations of Heat and Passion) prepared an Ordinance, which they sent up unto the Lords, importing the displacing of them from all those Places of Power and Command which they had in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Which being found too weak to hold, they fall upon another and a likelier Project, which was to bring the Lords to sit in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons House, where they were sure they should be inconsiderable both for Power and Number. And to effect the same with more speed and certainty, they had recourse to their old Arts, drawing down <hi>Watkins</hi> with his <hi>general muster of Subscriptions,</hi> and putting a Petition into his hands, to be tendred by him to the Houses, that is, themselves; wherein it was required, amongst other things, That they should <hi>vigorously proceed unto the punishment of all Delinquents</hi>; and that for the more quick dispatch of Publick Businesses of State, the <hi>Lords</hi> would please to <hi>Vote</hi> and <hi>Sit</hi> together with the <hi>Commons.</hi> On such uncertain terms, such a ticklish <hi>Tenure,</hi> did they then hold their Place and Power in Parliament, who so officiously complied with the House of Commons, in depriving the Bishops of their Vote, and the Churches Birth-right. And this was it which help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in that time of need. And yet not thinking this Device sufficient to fright their Lordships to a present compliance, <hi>Stroud</hi> was sent up with a Message from the House of Commons, to let them know, That the <hi>Londoners</hi> would shortly bring a Petition, with 20000 Hands, to obtain that Ordinance. By which stale and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Stratagem, they wrought so far on some weak Spirits, the rest withdrawing themselves (as formerly in the case of the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>) that in a thin and slender House, not above six or seven in number, it was pass'd at last. The day before they pass'd the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance for establishing their new <hi>Directory</hi>; which, in effect, was
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:54785:267"/>

And it was likewise certified of this Great <hi>Prelate,</hi> That on the Evening before his <hi>Passover,</hi> the night before the dismal Combate betwixt him and <hi>Death,</hi> after he had refreshed his Spirits with a moderate Supper, he betook himself unto his Rest, and slept very soundly, till the time came, in which his Servants were appointed to attend his Rising. A most assured sign of a Soul prepared.</p>
                  <p>The fatal morning being come, he first applied himself to his private Prayers, and so continued till <hi>Pennington,</hi> and others of their Publick Officers, came to conduct him to the Scaffold; which he ascended with so brave a Courage, such a chearful Countenance, as if he had mounted rather to behold a Triumph, than be made a <hi>Sacrifice</hi>; and came not there to <hi>Die,</hi> but to be <hi>Translated.</hi> And though some rude and uncivil People reviled him as he pass'd along, with opprobrious Language, as loth to let him <hi>go to the Grave in Peace</hi>; yet it never discomposed his Thoughts, nor disturb'd his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: For he had profited so well in the School of <hi>Christ, that when he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatned not, but committed his cause to him that judgeth righteously.</hi> And as he did not fear the Frowns, so neither did he covet the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of the <hi>Vulgar Herd</hi>; and therefore rather chose to read what he had to speak unto the People, than to affect the ostentation either of Memory or Wit in that dreadful <hi>Agony:</hi> whether with greater Magnanimity than Prudence, I can hardly say. As for the matter of his Speech, besides what did concern himself and his own <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> his great care was to cleer his Majesty, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from any inclination to <hi>Popery</hi>; with a perswasion of the which, the Authors of the then present Miseries had abused the People, and made them take up Arms against their Sovereign. A faithful Servant to the last: By means whereof, as it is said of <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> in the Book of <hi>Iudges, That the men which he slew at his death, were more than they which he slew in his life:</hi> So may it be affirmed of this famous Prelate, That he gave a greater blow unto the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church and the King at the hour of his death, than he had given them in his whole life before. But this you will more clearly see by the Speech it self, which followeth here according to the best and most perfect Copy, delivered by his own hands unto one of his Chaplains, and in his name presented to the King by the Lord <hi>Iohn Bellasis</hi> at the Court in <hi>Oxon.</hi>

                        <hi>And first, This I shall be bold to speak of the King our Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.

A way which may endanger many an</hi> Innocent <hi>man, and pluck his bloud upon their own heads, and perhaps upon the Cities also; and this hath been lately practiced against my self, the Magistrates standing still, and suffering them openly to proceed from Parish to Parish without any check.

But then finding that there was like to be no end of the troublesome Gentleman, he turned away from him, applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self directly to the Executioner, as the gentler and discreeter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Putting some mony into his hand he said unto him without the least distemper or change of countenance; <hi>Here honest friend, God forgive thee and I do, and do thy Office upon me with mercy,</hi> and having given him a sign when the blow should come, he kneeled down upon his knees, and prayed as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>This blow thus given, his life-less body remained a spectacle so unpleasing unto most of them who had desired his death with much heat and passion, that many who came with greedy eyes to see him suffer, went back with weeping eyes when they saw him dead; their own Consciences perhaps, bearing witness to them, God knows whose did, that they <hi>had sinned</hi> in being guilty of such <hi>Innocent blood.</hi> Of those whom only Curiosity and desire of Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, brought thither to behold that unusual sight, many had not the Patience to attend the Issue, but went away assoon as the Speech was ended; others returned much altered in the opinion which before they had of him, and bettered in their Resolutions toward the King and the Church, whose Honour and Religious Purposes, they saw so clearly vindicated in his dying, but never dying words. And for the Rest (the most considerable, though perhaps the smallest part of that Great Assembly) as they came thither with no other intention, then to assist him with their Prayers, to embalm his body with their tears, and to lay up his last Speeches in their hearts and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories: so when they had performed those Offices of Christian duty, they comforted themselves with this, that as his life was

The rest I shall refer to the <hi>Breviate</hi> of his Life and Action, though published of purpose to defame him, and render him more odious to the Common People: In which it will appear, to an equal and impartial Reader, That he was a man of such eminent Vertues, such an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Piety towards God, such an unwearied Fidelity to his Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sovereign, of such a publick Soul towards Church and State, so fixt a Constancy in Friendship, and one so little byassed by his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Interesses, that <hi>Plutarch,</hi> if he were alive, would be much troubled to find a sufficient Parallel wherewith to match him in all the Lineaments of perfect Vertue.</p>
                     <p>Thus lived this most Reverend, Renowned, and Religious Prelate; and thus he died; when he had lived seventy one years, thirteen Weeks, and four daies, if at the least he may be properly said to die: the great Example of whose Vertue shall continue alway, not only in the Minds of Men, but in the Annals of succeeding Ages with Renown and Fame. His Death the more remarkable in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on St. <hi>Williams</hi> day, as if it did design him to an equal place in the <hi>English</hi> Calendar, with that which <hi>William,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Bourgeois,</hi> had obtained in the <hi>French</hi>; Who being as great a Zealot in his time against the spreading and increase of the <hi>Albigenses,</hi> (as <hi>Laud</hi> was thought to be against those of the Puritan Faction, and the Scottish Covenanters) hath ever since been honoured as a Saint in the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church; the tenth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> being destined for the solemnities of his Commemoration, on which day our <hi>Laud</hi> ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Scaffold to a Throne of Glory.</p>

                  <l>The Image of thy Nobler Part, thy Mind:</l>
                  <l>Thy Name shall be thy Epitaph, and he</l>
                  <l>Which hears and reads of that, shall publish thee</l>
                  <l>Above the reach of Titles, and shall say</l>
                  <l>None could express thy Worths a braver way.</l>
                  <l>And thus, though murther'd, thou shalt never die,</l>
                  <l>But live Renown'd to all Posterity.</l>
                  <l>Rest thou then happy in the Sweets of Bliss,</l>
                  <l>Th' <hi>Elyzian,</hi> the Christians Paradise,</l>
                  <l>Exempt from Worldly Cares, secure from Fears;</l>
                  <l>And let us have thy Prayers, as thou our Tears.</l>
