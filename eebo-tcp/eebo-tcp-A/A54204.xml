            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REASONS
WHY THE
OATHS
Should not be made
A Part of the Teſt
TO
Proteſtant Diſſenters.</head>
            <p>1. WE do humbly conceive, that becauſe theſe
<hi>Oaths</hi> were Antiently made upon Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the <hi>Conſpiracies</hi> of <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt
the Government, and are now reviv'd upon the ſcore of the late
Diſcovery of their <hi>Horrid Plot;</hi> and that ſince they only ought
at any time to be adminiſtred in Caſe of Juſt Jealouſie or Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had of any Perſon or Perſons: We, who are no <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but
by our Faith and Doctrine <hi>Repugnant</hi> to all Popery; And We,
who have never ſhown the leaſt <hi>Diſallegiance</hi> or <hi>Vnfaithfulneſs,</hi>
but on the Contrary have been patient and peaceable under all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57564:2"/>
that Exceſs of Severity, that in ſeveral parts of this Nation hath
been inflicted upon us, ought not to be brought under the <hi>ſame
Jealouſies</hi> with the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> It is ſuſpecting an Integrity, that
was never <hi>Tainted.</hi> For with ſubmiſſion, what is it but to ſay,
The <hi>Papiſts</hi> have plotted againſt the King, Government and
Proteſtant Religion; <hi>therefore the</hi> Quakers <hi>and ſuch like Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that have not plotted, ſhall take the Oaths, to try and bind
them, as if they had plotted?</hi> This makes no Diſtinction, where
really there is a great one. The Oaths were not revived upon
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> till the <hi>Plot</hi> was diſcovered; pray why ſhould you
effect us, or queſtion the Integrity of <hi>Proteſtant-Diſſenters?</hi>
Let the known <hi>Papiſts</hi> be proved and teſted as <hi>Papiſts;</hi> but that
can be no Reaſon why the known <hi>Anti-Papiſts</hi> or <hi>Proteſtant-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi>
ſhould be ſo teſted that are Unconcerned in the Occaſion
of it.</p>
            <p>II. We are not yet preferred by the Government to ſuch
Charge, Truſt or Employment, for which ſuch Security is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
required, and ſince we ever liv'd a Sober and Peaceable
Life under the King and Government, being neither <hi>Papiſts,
Plotters</hi> nor <hi>Men in Power,</hi> we do not ſee the Reaſon or Equity,
as to us, why the <hi>Oaths</hi> ſhould be made a part of the <hi>Teſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ III. We conceive, we need not Swear to deny a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi>
or to pay an <hi>Obedience,</hi> where our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi>
teacheth us both; which are a ſtronger <hi>Tie</hi> upon our Conſciences,
than all the <hi>Oaths</hi> in the World. And of the Truth of this we
may appeal to your own Knowledge of our Converſations.</p>
            <p>IV. We apprehend, that the <hi>Oaths</hi> anſwer not the Reaſon
of their Impoſition, and therefore Uſeleſs; for the <hi>Papiſts</hi> we
ſee, take them: and conſequently there is no Diſcrimination of
<hi>Papiſts</hi> from <hi>Proteſtants</hi> by them. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o that they ſerve rather to
Diſtinguiſh, what <hi>Prote<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ant-Diſſenters</hi> are Tender in taking
theſe Oaths, <hi>than to diſcover who are</hi> Papiſts. But ſince the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi>
is of more weight to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> than the <hi>Oaths,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that denyes their <hi>Religion,</hi> whereas the <hi>Oaths</hi> only deny
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57564:2"/>
the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi> (which is not owned by the <hi>Gallican</hi> or
<hi>French Church,</hi> that they now moſtly pretend to adhere to)
it will evidently follow, that all thoſe <hi>Proteſtant-Diſſenters,</hi> who
can ſubſcribe the Declaration, are not <hi>Papiſts,</hi> nor of the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Communion. In ſhort; ☞Becauſe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will ſooner take
 the <hi>Oaths</hi> than ſubſcribe the <hi>Declaration;</hi> and that the
<hi>Quakers</hi> and other <hi>Diſſenters</hi> will ſooner ſubſcribe the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi>
than take the <hi>Oaths:</hi> And foraſmuch as the point in hand
is to diſcriminate <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and not ſuch <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> the adding
of the <hi>Oaths,</hi> when the <hi>Declaration</hi> will moſt Effectually do, may
ſerve to enſnare the ſaid <hi>Proteſtant-Diſſenters,</hi> but not to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or ſecure the Government from them, which
ought to be the only end of the Teſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it is objected, <hi>That ſome</hi> Papiſts <hi>will not take the</hi>
Oaths, <hi>and therefore they ought to be a part of the</hi> Teſt.</p>
            <p>To which we Anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Concealed Papiſts,</hi> or
thoſe who are ſuſpected to be ſuch, are obſerv'd to <hi>ſwallow</hi> all,
both <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Declaration</hi> too, rather than bring themſelves
under Notice at this time of the Day. And <hi>Next,</hi> It is plain
Fact, that the Generality of the <hi>Known Papiſts</hi> alſo take them.
So that ſtill theſe <hi>Oaths</hi> being made a part of the <hi>Teſt,</hi> rather
ſhews that <hi>Papiſts</hi> will take the <hi>Oaths,</hi> than that they <hi>diſcriminate
who are Papiſts:</hi> ☞And here it may be worth your Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
 how much ſecurer you are from thoſe <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that do
take the <hi>Oaths,</hi> than from thoſe that refuſe them. But
admitting it to be a real Diſcrimination reſpecting a few <hi>Papiſts,</hi>
yet we intreat you weigh, If the Number of the <hi>Proteſtant-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi>
who may ſcruple taking theſe <hi>Oaths,</hi> is not <hi>far greater,</hi>
than of thoſe <hi>Papiſts</hi> that may refuſe to take them: and if ſo, you
will <hi>loſe much more</hi> than you will get by taking the <hi>Oaths</hi> into
the <hi>Teſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. Be pleaſed to conſider, that if you are not very Careful
in this matter, by expoſing ſuch <hi>Proteſtant-Diſſenters</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> becauſe of not taking the <hi>Oaths,</hi> you may be ſaid,
in a ſort, to make more <hi>Papiſts</hi> by one <hi>Act,</hi> than the <hi>Popes</hi> and their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57564:3"/>
               <hi>Emiſſaries</hi> have done theſe <hi>Six ſcore Years;</hi> though they abhor
Popery as much as you your ſelves can do. We hope, the Wiſdom
of the Government will not thus ſuffer a great part of the Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
people of the Nation to be vex'd &amp; ruin'd for that which
they are not; and at a time too, when it is your Intereſt to lend
a hand to the <hi>Weakeſt Proteſtant-Separatiſt</hi> you have, againſt the
<hi>Church of Rome;</hi> That ſo the Numbers of that Society may not
be augmented, by enlarging that Scandalous Character to other
Perſwaſions through the Prejudice, Falſe Policy or Ill Deſigns
of any.</p>
            <p>VI. Your making the <hi>Oaths</hi> a part of the <hi>Test,</hi> will be very
particularly Injurious to ſuch <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> ☞for you will puniſh
 them by Laws made upon Occaſion of <hi>Popiſh Plots,</hi> who are
unconcern'd in the Guilt of them. This is in Shew to charge
your <hi>Canon</hi> againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but they will ('tis to be fear'd) be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
upon <hi>Proteſtant-Diſſenters,</hi> as hath already been done:
which is adding another <hi>miſery</hi> to them, whom you <hi>ſhould relieve,</hi>
and making them loſe by the Diſcovery of the <hi>Plot,</hi> that would
have been expos'd as well as your ſelves, if it had taken Effect:
So that thoſe who would have ſuffer'd by the <hi>Plot, muſt ſuffer
as of the Party of the Plotters.</hi> In ſhort, this is puniſhing one
Party for the Fault of another, and extending the Penalty, where
there is no Tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>VII. Let it be conſider'd, that ſuch Diſſenters will be of all
People the moſt Miſerable: For being expos'd to the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the Puniſhment of <hi>Proteſtant-Diſſenters</hi> too,
they muſt needs be in a worſe Condition, than the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> for
they will be at this rate ground between two <hi>Mill-ſtones.</hi> And
this will rather deter <hi>Papiſts</hi> from embracing the Communion of
any <hi>Proteſtant-Diſſenters,</hi> then excite them to approach ſo near
to the <hi>Church,</hi> as to become <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in any Senſe: becauſe
they will be expos'd to more Suffering, unleſs abſolute Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
then now they are, as <hi>Papiſts.</hi> For both the Laws made
againſt <hi>Proteſtant-Diſſenters,</hi> and the Laws made againſt <hi>Popiſh
Recuſants</hi> have been executed upon <hi>Proteſtant-Diſſenters;</hi> but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57564:3"/>
the particular Laws made againſt <hi>Proteſtant-Diſſenters</hi> were
never infflicted upon the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VIII. But it is Objected by ſome, that we are <hi>diſguiz'd Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi>
or that <hi>Papiſts</hi> are concealed amongſt us. To which we
ſay, the <hi>Declaration</hi> will determine that; ſince (as was ſaid)
the <hi>Oaths</hi> only deny the <hi>Pope's Supremacy,</hi> which ſome of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
pretend to diſown: But our <hi>Declaration</hi> denies both the
<hi>Pope's Supremacy and their Religion</hi> too. Beſides, thoſe <hi>Diſſenters</hi>
that ſcruple the <hi>Oaths,</hi> do it not upon the ſame Terms with the
<hi>Papiſts</hi>; for they own no <hi>forreign</hi> Supremacy, which the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>
do. And to prove evidently, that it is no Trick or Ill deſign
againſt the Government, <hi>they refuſe to Swear in their own Right,
having-frequently loſt their Juſt Debts, and been greatly injur'd
by other mens Vnjuſt Claims, becauſe of not taking an Oath</hi>:
which is not the Practice of <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IX. But there is one Reaſon never to be anſwered, why we
can neither be <hi>Papiſts,</hi> nor <hi>Popiſhly</hi> affected, as we muſt needs
be, if we ſeek to Conceal the <hi>Papiſts</hi> at ſo much hazard to our
ſelves; and it is this, You have been pleaſed in Parliament to
Complain of the growth of <hi>Popery,</hi> of the Non-executing of
Laws made againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and that ſome of the Miniſters of
State were <hi>Popiſhly</hi> affected, and that things have generally
been Tranſacted by them in favour of the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
we have been great Sufferers, our Houſes broke open,
our Goods riffled, and our Eſtates ſeized, and Treble values
taken away from us by Laws made againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> under their
Miniſtry. So that either we are no <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or ſuch State-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and Councils, whom you have reputed <hi>Popiſh,</hi> muſt not be
ſuch; for none can think that they ſhould Exerciſe ſuch Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
upon People of the ſame Inclinations, when they were ſo
indulgent to Perſons notoriouſly of that Profeſſion; but becauſe
you believe they were ſo, you muſt needs interpret from their
being more ſevere to us than any other People, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
us moſt remote from <hi>Popery.</hi> What greater Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can we give, that we believe our ſelves, and are Sincere in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57564:4"/>
this matter, than the Hazards and Loſſes we are daily expos'd
to?</p>
            <p>X. We have always ſhewn a good and ſteady Affection to
the Juſt, Civil and Proteſtant Intereſt of this Nation; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other things, it may evidently appear in the late Election
of the preſent Parliament, <hi>having generally adhered to, and
through all Difficulties given our Voices for thoſe Perſons, that
have been of the beſt Reputation in their Country for Proteſtants and
Engliſh men.</hi> And indeed, there has been no ſuch Diſcovery
made theſe many years of the Inclinations of all Parties: ☞which being well obſerv'd, it will perhaps appear, that We and
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have as little joyn'd in the ſame Choice of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
as ſome <hi>High Church-men</hi> (our great Proſecutors) have
done, who would notwithſtanding have us accounted <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
And we may further add, that ſince our giving our Voices in
the ſaid late Election for thoſe Perſons, which are known to be
hearty for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and <hi>Civil Intereſt</hi> of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we have been afreſh ſeverely perſecuted in ſeveral places, and
that as well by Laws made againſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> as Proteſtant Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We do here humbly offer a DECLARATION,
