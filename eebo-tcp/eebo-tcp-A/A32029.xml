            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS Wee by Our Gratious Proclamation, bearing date the tenth of November now laſt paſt, freely offered Our Grace, Favour, and Pardon to all Seamen, Sailers, Mariners and other Watermen, who having been formerly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſome Traiterous and Seditious Perſons, were this laſt yeare uſed as Inſtruments, to detaine Our Ships from Vs; yet under this Proviſo nevertheleſſe, that they did ſpeedily returne to their Obedience and Loyalty, and did not from thenceforth preſume to ſerve in any of Our ſhips detained from Vs, or otherwiſe to ſerve againſt Vs by Sea or Land, or by Loane, Contribution, or otherwiſe to aſſiſt the Army raiſed againſt Vs, or to Aſſemble or Muſter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Armes, without authority derived from Vs, or enter into any Oath of Aſſociation, for oppoſing Vs or Our Army, as by the ſaid Proclamation more at large may appeare. And whereas afterwards, We by another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, bearing date the tenth of February now laſt paſt, did again admoniſh all Our Subjects of the quality before mentioned, and alſo all Our Officers, Victuallers and Servants of all ſorts belonging to Our Ships or Navy, that they ſhould from thenceforth, forbear to intermeddle in the Graving, Rigging Furniſhing, Manning, or Serving of, or in Our ſhips, by the direction of <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> or any other, without Our ſpeciall direction and Warrant, upon the paines, in the ſaid laſt Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation mentioned, as by that Proclamation it may alſo at large appeare. And whereas We have bin informed, that ſome wicked &amp; ſeditious Perſons intending to ſeduce Our good Subjects, and with falſe-hoods to abuſe them, that they not knowing the truth, might ſtill be miſled (as formerly they have been) to ſerve the Wicked deſignes, and Treaſonable practices of ſuch as are in Rebellion againſt Vs, have given out and publiſhed, That whatſoever is intended for the preparation and ſetting out of the Navy in the Spring now approaching, is done by Our ſpeciall direction and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Warrant, which is utterly falſe, We not having any purpoſe or reaſon to truſt our Navy, or any of Our Ships in their hands and power who have given ſo cleer a teſtimony of their former diſloyalty unto Vs, and of their endeavours to deſtroy Vs and Our Kingdom: We doe therefore hereby Publiſh and declare, That we have not given, nor doe intend to give any ſuch command, direction or conſent, that any of Our Ships, or any other Ships of this Our Kingdom, ſhall be Prepared, Victualled, Rigged, Man'd, or ſet to Sea, by, or under the Command or Conduct of the Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> or any other Perſon or Perſons whatſoever, by any pretended authority from one or both the Houſes of Parliament, without and againſt Our conſent and expreſſe Command. And We doe further give notice hereby to all Our Subjects, whom it may any wayes concerne, that as We are and ever ſhall be carefull to the utmoſt of Our Power to protect Our Good Subjects from the Malice of Ours and their Enemies, either at home or abroad, and to that end ſhall uſe all the juſt means We poſſibly can to reſtore them to their former Peace, whereby they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the comfort of the true Proteſtant Religion in the integrity thereof, the Freedome of the known Lawes, the Liberty of their Perſons, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of their Eſtates, and juſt priviledges of Parliament, whatſoever is malitiouſly and ſlanderouſly ſuggeſted to the contrary, ſo We will by the due courſe of Law, vindicate Our Honour with a juſt indignation againſt and upon all thoſe who from henceforth, after ſo many gratious admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and offer of Free Pardon for what is paſt, (which We doe now again gratiouſly and freely renew) ſhall wilfully and malitiouſly preſume to give aſſiſtance in any thing to the ſaid Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> or any other, who upon any ſpecious, but falſe pretences, ſhall endeavour in this yeare now enſuing, to Prepare, Rigge up, Victuall, Furniſh, Manne, or ſet forth any of Our own Shippes, or any other Shippes of Warre, appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any others, without Our Warrant under Our hand and Seale; We being well aſſured, that under the pretence of making a defence for the Kingdome againſt ſome imaginary forraigne Enemy (where in truth We know not of, or have cauſe to ſuſpect any ſuch) the purpoſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver of theſe Rebellious Actions, is manifeſt to be in the firſt place wickedly and traiterouſly to convert Our Navy, and the Navy of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the deſtruction of Vs and of Our Crown, and good Subjects, and to make themſelves Maſters thereof, if they can therein prevaile (as We hope by Gods bleſſing they ſhall not) and if they prevaile not, then by the Convoy of thoſe Ships to convey themſelves and thoſe who goe with them into ſome forraigne parts, with a purpoſe that neither themſelves nor thoſe who ſerve them ſhall returne to their native Country, to whom they have been ſo profeſſed Enemies, and by this means to rob the Kingdom of the Shipping which is the defence thereof; And that theſe are the undoubted intentions, if the former Acts of Hoſtility againſt Vs performed the laſt yeare, by ſome of thoſe Ships ſet out under the name of the ſaid Earle, and by the authority of the two Houſes of Parliament, were not ſufficient to ſatisfy Vs and all others, The late barbarous Actions of, and by ſome of thoſe Ships, within a very few daies now paſt at <hi>Burlington Bay</hi> in Our County of <hi>Yorke,</hi> to the hazard of the life of Our deareſt Conſort the Queene, at the time of Her landing there (if God in his great mercy had not protected and delivered Her) not caſually but purpoſely committed, will give ſufficient teſtimony thereof to all the World, to the perpetuall ſhame of the Actors and Abettors thereof, For which in due time they muſt expect their juſt reward.</p>
