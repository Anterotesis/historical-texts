            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>M I therefore become your enemy,
becauſe I tell you the truth</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 10.</note>, (ſaith
the firſt-born<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 8.</note>, and yet the laſt born al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 14. 16.</note>, of the Apoſtles to his <hi>Galathians;</hi>)
The interrogation is a conſtructive aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of two things. Firſt, that to ſpeak the
truth in ſome caſes, is very opportune to ſiniſter interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and apt to repreſent the ſpeaker as a man of no benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
or friendly comportance with thoſe, to whom he ſo ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
The reaſon whereof ſeems to be this: Errors and miſpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
are many times very indulgent and bountifull to the
fleſh; and he that incounters men under ſuch injoyments,
with the truth, ſeems to them rather to ſtrike at theſe injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
then at the error or opinion, by whoſe conſent they
have firſt taken, and ſtill keep poſſeſsion of them. Themſelves
eſteeming the opinion of ſmall value (as well it deſerves)
ſave onely in reference to thoſe carnall gratifications; are
very apt to conceive that neither doe others ſo much minde
that, or take offence at that, as at thoſe priviledges or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations
which they injoy by it: and this they judge to be
a ſtraine of an hoſtile inclination.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The prementioned Interrogation ſuppoſeth, that
no manifeſtation or ſpeaking of what truth ſoever unto men,
ſimply as ſuch, is any argument at all of want of affection,
and that in the higheſt, unto them. The reaſon is, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:124227:3"/>
there is no Truth, which being imbraced, and honoured with
ſutable practiſe, but will give farre better wages and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
to her ſervants in due time, then any error whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
Yea, the truth is, that the greater breach, or ſpoyle, a
Truth makes in any mans worldly poſſeſsions or enjoyments,
it is of ſo much the richer and the more advantagious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
unto him, and will honour him the more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
It is the manner and guiſe of divine truth, to pull downe
houſes built with firres and brick, and to build them up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
with cedars and hewne ſtones.</p>
            <p>He that deals much either in the diſcoverie, (or recovery
rather) or inforcement of ſuch truths, which are oppoſed in
the world, not onely by errors and contrary miſpriſons, but
by ſecular accommodations alſo, as of honour, power, riches,
pleaſures, or the like, takes a very direct courſe to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
conformable to the image of his Saviour, who being ſo
great a Benefactor to the world, was yet <hi>numbred amongſt
Tranſgreſſors.</hi> To attempt the <hi>caſting downe of</hi> ſuch <hi>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination,
which</hi> do not onely <hi>exalt themſelves</hi> in the
minds of men, but contribute alſo to the exaltation of men
themſelves in the world, be they never ſo extravagant or ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centricall
to the truth, is an undertaking of almoſt as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a preſage, as they that ſpeak Proverbs are wont to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
by the <hi>taking a Lion by the beard, or an Elephant
by the tooth.</hi> And did not the God of Truth umpire
(and that with an high hand) amongſt the thoughts and
counſells of the ſons of men, and put many a by ingredient
into his providence of ſoveraign reliefe to thoſe, whoſe hearts
are ſet, and hands lift up to magnifie ſuch Truths, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
advanced are like to doe juſtice in the world, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
all uſurpations and unrighteous detainments amongſt
men,<note place="margin">Amos 7. 10.</note> the Earth would not <hi>be able to beare the words</hi> of
ſuch men; and the world ſoone become too hot a climate for
Truths of ſuch a complexion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:124227:3"/>
It is a matter of ſomewhat a ſad contemplation, (and yet
in part, delightfull alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> as thoſe Oracles of Heaven,
the Scriptures, are mightily aſſerted and vindicated like
themſelves thereby) to ſee, what commotions, tumults, and
combuſtions are preſently raiſed in the minds and ſpirits of
men upon the birth (or reſurrection rather) of any Truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, concerning which there is the leaſt jealouſie,
that in caſe it ſhould reigne, it would rack them from off the
lees of their old cuſtomes, or compell them to a reſtitution of
what they have unjuſtly taken, and peaceably injoyed for a
long time, or any wayes expoſe them to any outward ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
or diſaccommodations in the world; to ſee, what hurry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
up and downe, what ingaging of parties, what inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
after parts and abilities, what rembling over Authors
old and new, what incenſing of Authoritie, what ſtreynings
of wits and conſciences, what ſlighting of ſolid arguments,
what evading ſubſtantiall and cleare interpretations of
Scripture, what magnifying of thoſe that are ſtreined and
farre fetch'd in their ſtead, what caſting abroad of calumnies
and reproaches, what incruſtations, and miſrepreſentations
of opinions, ſayings, practiſes, actions, what ſhiftings, what
blendings, what colourings, what pretendings, what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracings,
yea, what conventings, what perſecutions, what
evill intreatings of men, what appealings to fire, ſword, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
baniſhment, confiſcations, and all to turn a beam of light
and glorie, into darknes &amp; ſhame, to keep a new-born Truth
from ruling over them. As ſoone as <hi>Herod the King</hi> heard
that Chriſt was borne, and that <hi>wiſe men were come from
the Eaſt to worſhip him,</hi> inquiring after him, as <hi>a King;</hi>
the Text ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 2. 1, 2, 3.</note> that <hi>he was troubled, and all Jeruſalem
with him:</hi> and how unnaturall and bloudy a deſign was there
preſently put in execution, to prevent the reigning of him
that was but now borne into the world? That <hi>one,</hi> who yet
<pb facs="tcp:124227:4"/>
was their lawfull King, might not reigne over them, <hi>many</hi>
poore infants (innocents altogether in this) were not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to live amongſt them. This Scene alſo was acted in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
when God firſt made <hi>Luther</hi> as <hi>life from the dead</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 11. 25.</note>
vnto the Doctrine of free juſtification and remiſsion of ſins;
a Doctrine not ſo much oppoſed by the Popiſh Tenet concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the vertue and validitie of Papall Indulgences, as by
the<note n="b" place="margin">Auri ſacra fames.</note> ſacred thirſt of that gold and ſilver which the trade of
ſuch merchandize formerly driven by the Grand Seignior
of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Factors throughout the Chriſtian world,
brought into their coffers in that bewitching and tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abundance.</p>
            <p>Reader,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 5.</note> of any wrong done to my ſelf, I will not complaine:
but I know a man, who hath been forſaken of his friends,
found thoſe of his own houſe to be his enemies, who hath been
reviled, traduced, reproached, way-laid, by tongues, by pens,
by practiſes, reported to have loſt his wits, abilities, parts,
ſuffered loſſe of his due and neceſſary ſubſiſtence, wrongfully
deteined from him, and for which he hath laboured faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
brought before Rulers and Magiſtrates, repreſented to
Soveraigne Authoritie, as <hi>a wilfull and preſumptuous
underminer of their undoubted priviledges,</hi> and that
<hi>diametrally contrary to his Vow and Covenant;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
twenty more hard ſayings and practiſes of men againſt
him; and all this for no other cauſe, upon none other ground
or exception, but onely becauſe he holds forth ſuch a Truth
(as in all his heart and all his ſoule he is verily perſwaded)
which, if entertained, is like to bleſſe the world, though it be
<hi>as by fire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 15.</note> I meane by caſting downe the preſent thoughts,
and croſsing the preſent deſires and deſigns of many in it:
Of the injuries &amp; indignities offered to ſuch a man, I have
cauſe (with many others) to complaine; but for any ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

Upon the ſtock of ſo faire and rich an incouragement,<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> as this,
I conceive it very proper for mee to graffe (at leaſt) the preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſome errors and miſtakes (more then ſo called) to Maſter
<hi>Prynnes</hi> view, which himſelf had firſt ſcatteringly, preſented to the
view of the world, in his late piece, called, <hi>A full Reply, &amp;c.</hi> and
will (I truſt) aſſiſt my Pen with his in the cenſure and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them; I make no queſtion, but that he will acknowledge
it an <hi>errour and miſtake</hi> in any man, to <hi>confute concealed errours and
miſtakes</hi> with thoſe that are open and profeſſed. Hee makes a ſad
complaint (in the very beginning of his work) that his <hi>condition</hi>
ſtill hath been to have his <hi>beſt actions and publique ſervices</hi> (he means
performed by his Pen) <hi>miſconſtrued</hi> and <hi>traduced;</hi> and yet a few
lines after, hee affirms that his <hi>twelve Queſtions touching Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
gave ample ſatisfaction to many truly Religious, of all ranks
and qualities, who returned him ſpeciall thanks.</hi> He that can give men,
yea, the beſt of men, men <hi>truly Religious,</hi> yea, not a few of theſe
men neither, but <hi>many,</hi> and that <hi>of all ranks and qualities ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
yea, <hi>ample ſatisfaction</hi> (and receive thanks accordingly) only
by <hi>asking Queſtions,</hi> ſeems to write with <hi>Fortunatus</hi> his Pen; and
may well beare the burthen of much miſpriſion from other men,
out of the ſtrength of the joy of this rare ſucceſſe. Ordinarily,
men of greateſt worth and learning, have much ado <hi>to give ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi>
by the moſt elaborate and exact reſolutions; which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>manner of ſervice</hi> to the world, then <hi>asking Queſtions</hi> is: A weak
man may ask moe Queſtions in an houre, then ſeven wiſe men can
anſwer in ſeven yeeres. And when hee ſaith, that <hi>our Saviour both
inſtructed and refuted his oppoſites and auditors, by demanding Queſtions
only,</hi> I conceive it is a miſtake: As for thoſe Scriptures which hee
cites to prove this, ſome of them being more then half Chapters,
moſt of them very large portions of Chapters; he that ſhall pleaſe
to peruſe them, ſhall finde more in them, then <hi>demanding Queſtions
only.</hi> No <hi>queſtion demanded</hi> by our Saviour was further <hi>inſtructive,</hi>
then as it gave occaſion to an anſwer. It is the <hi>marrow</hi> of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
not the <hi>bone</hi> of the Queſtion that nouriſheth with inſtruction;
And <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 47. (the firſt Scripture alledged by him in this Cauſe)
it is ſaid, <hi>That all that heard him were aſtoniſhed at his underſtanding

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:124227:6"/>
for the advancement of knowledge; only herein we muſt crave
pardon, if we judge it no ſigne of any depth or thoroughneſs in an
Argument or Subject, to be imperious and ſore in asking Queſtions
about it, and but weak and ſuperficiall in giving Anſwers.</p>
            <p>Again,<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> whereas hee ſuppoſeth, <hi>p.</hi> 4. that <hi>Independent Miniſters
and Congregations lay claim to a ſoveraign Temporall all Juriſdiction,</hi> for <hi>the
preſcribing and ſetting up of a Church-Government;</hi> certainly it is a
miſtake, (whatſoever it is more) they claim to <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> at all,
much leſſe any <hi>temporall Juriſdiction,</hi> leaſt of all any <hi>ſoveraign Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi>
to <hi>preſcribe</hi> unto any (much leſs, to command or injoyn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
penalties, which is proper to <hi>ſoveraign Temporall Juriſdiction</hi>) any
<hi>Church-Government</hi> whatſoever: they only ſubmit to that <hi>good and
holy and perfect Will of God,</hi> for the regulation of themſelves, in point
of order amongſt themſelves, as far as he hath pleaſed to inlighten
them with the knowledge thereof; without taking any offence at
others, for being contrary-minded to them, and without the leaſt
ſemblance or ſhew of claiming any <hi>Authoritative</hi> or <hi>Temporall power</hi>
to impoſe or force what they practiſe themſelves upon others.</p>
            <p>Again, whereas becauſe ſome of the Independents (as he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
them, <hi>p.</hi> 5. whether truly or no, I can neither affirm, nor deny)
<hi>refuſe to heare the Scriptures read in our Churches,</hi> hee thinks to evict
this practice of theirs, by proving (and that by no leſſe then thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Texts of Scripture) that <hi>publique reading of them is an ordinance
of God;</hi> I conceive it is a defect or <hi>miſtake</hi> in point of proof. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
if ſuch <hi>refuſall</hi> be made by any, it is not made either upon
denying or queſtioning, whether <hi>publike reading of the Scriptures,
be an Ordinance of God;</hi> but either upon queſtioning, whether the
bare reading of them in publique, without giving the ſenſe of them,
or framing ſome exhortation upon them, or the like, be an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God (which ſome of the Scriptures cited by himſelf, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
<hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 8. make very queſtionable) or elſe upon this reaſon
and ground of conſcience, that a man may very ſafely refuſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
accommodation for his ſoul, when he hath a lawfull op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to injoy a ſuperiour.</p>
            <p>Again,<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> whereas he affirms, <hi>p. 5. the only point in queſtion</hi> (I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
he means about Church-Government only to be, whether
<hi>the Independent modell alone be that exact, unalterable form of Church-Government,
which Chriſt hath punctually &amp; particularly ſet down for all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:124227:7"/>
Chriſtian nations, Churches to follow;</hi> and yet both in the ſame <hi>page</hi>
afterwards, and in ſeverall paſſages beſides in this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> denies
that there is any ſuch <hi>form of Government, ſo punctually and particuar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſet down by Chriſt,</hi> doubtles it cannot but be <hi>a miſtake,</hi> if it amounts
not to an error: for they that hold the <hi>Independent modell</hi> (as hee
calleth it) to be the <hi>only form of Church-Government, which Chriſt hath
ſo punctually and particularly ſet down,</hi> muſt needs hold withall, that
Chriſt hath ſet down a form of Church-Government upon ſuch
terms, I mean, which is, and muſt be, <hi>unalterable.</hi> Now M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynne,</hi>
(with many others of his judgement, in this controverſie) denying
this latter opinion, as well as the former, evident it is, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
cannot be <hi>the only point in queſtion.</hi> But the truth is, that beſides
both the one point &amp; the other, there are many others in queſtion,
though poſſibly not of that difficulty or importance: yea, himſelf
in the following <hi>page,</hi> propounds another queſtion, differing from
this, to which notwithſtanding hee appropriates the ſame honour,
and affirms it to be the <hi>ſole Queſtion</hi> too.</p>
            <p>Again,<note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> 
               <hi>p.</hi> 6. whereas he determines, <hi>moderated or regulated Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi>
to be <hi>the ſame with Presbyterie;</hi> I conceive this determination
will hardly be voted orthodox in the Aſſembly it ſelf, nor in the
generall Aſſembly of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> For my part, though
I cannot approve of it as matter of truth, yet for matter of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
otherwiſe, I have nothing to charge it with.</p>
            <p>Again, whereas (in the ſame <hi>page</hi>) in caſe <hi>the Parliament by the
Synods advice, ſhould unanimouſly eſtabliſh a moderated Epiſcopacy, as
moſt conſonant to the Scriptures,</hi> he profeſſeth for himſelf, that hee
<hi>ſhall readily ſubmit unto it;</hi> and withall demands of the Anti-Queriſt,
<hi>Why not hee, and all others?</hi> as if either the <hi>conſonancy</hi> of
a practice to the Scriptures, or the example of one man <hi>ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
unto it as conſonant thereunto, were a ſufficient ground for
all men whatſoever to ſubmit likewiſe unto it, without any more
ado; this ſavours ſtrongly of that error, which comports ſo well
with the practice of ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> that if men in Authority ſhall
conclude and injoyn any thing, as <hi>conſonant to the Word of God,</hi>
all men are bound readily to ſubmit unto it, without <hi>asking any
Queſtion for conſcience ſake;</hi> yea, or whether they ſee either conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
or diſſonancy in it thereunto.</p>
            <p>Again,<note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> whereas he owns this ſaying, <hi>p.</hi> 6. as the naturall iſſue
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:124227:7"/>
lawfully begotten of the body or ſoule (th'one) of his own poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>Politicians and Stateſman are fit to be conſulted with to ſuit
a Church-government beſt to the Civill State;</hi> certainly it is no aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be rejoyced in. For as the Apoſtles made their enemies
themſelves judges in this point between them, <hi>Whether it was meet
to obey God, or them:</hi> So ſhall I willingly abide the arbitration of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of all thoſe that make but the leaſt conſcience of fearing God
and his King (Chriſt,) whether the government of Chriſts Church
and Kingdome ſhould condeſcend, and be compelled by Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and Stateſmen to doe obeyſance to civill States in accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating
them; or whether the government of theſe ſhould not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
veyle, and doe homage unto that, and deny themſelves in
their moſt indeered Principles and maximes of State, to give all
accommodation and honour unto it. The truth is, that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Chriſts Kingdome in a civill State, will never do any great
thing for it, except it firſt receive accommodation from it. The
truth knowes no compliance, but onely with thoſe that ſubmit
to it.</p>
            <p>Whereas (pag.<note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note> 6.) he placeth <hi>the whole repreſentative as well
Church as State of England in the Parliament,</hi> though I dare not gain-ſay
it, fearing leſt Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> claiming (as it ſhould ſeem) a priviledge
to make the privileges of Parliament what he pleaſeth, ſhould make
it <hi>a preſumptuous and wilfull undermining of the undoubted priviledges
of Parliament by the very roots:</hi> yet I muſt ingenuouſly profeſſe, that
it is a notion which I know not how to procure quarter for in my
brain, as yet. What I may doe hereafter when the Gentleman ſhall
beſtow more coſt and pains upon it to reconcile the diſproportion
which for the preſent it carrieth to my underſtanding, I will not
predetermine. But none of all the Authors or Books that ever yet
I was debtor unto, for any grain or ſcruple of that knowledge
wherewith God hath pleaſed to recompence my labour in ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ever licenſed mee to call any Aſſembly the Repreſentative
Church of any State or Kingdome wherein there is not ſo much as
any one Church-officer to be found</p>
            <p>Whereas he affirmes it (in the ſame page) <hi>a truth ſo cleare,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 8.</note> 
               <hi>that no
rationall man, good Chriſtian, or ſubject, can deny it, that the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative
Church and State of England in Parliament, have ſufficient
authoritie by Gods law to over-rule and bind all, or any particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:124227:8"/>
or congregations of it, as well as the major part of an Independent
Congregation, power to over-vote and rule the leſſer part, and to order
yea, bind any of their particular members;</hi> though for the danger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid,
it be not (perhaps) ſo ſafe for me ſimply to call the
latter aſſertion touching the compariſon between the two
powers, either an error or a miſtake; yet that this aſſertion
ſhould be a truth ſo royally qualified, that <hi>no reaſonable man, or
good Chriſtian can deny it,</hi> ſeemes not ſo reaſonable. The reaſon is,
becauſe in an Independent congregation, all the members by free
and voluntary conſent have ſubmitted themſelves to the regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and order of the whole body, or (which is the ſame) of the
major part of it: and therefore this body having received a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
power in a lawfull way, for the reiglement of her reſpective
members, may lawfully exerciſe it according to the tenor and true
intent of the delegation of it: whereas there are many thouſands
in the Church and State of <hi>England,</hi> who by Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
(p. 24. line 3. 4.) have not given any ſuch conſent
for their regulation in matters Eccleſiaſticall, and which concerne
Religion, unto the Parliament; yea, and there are many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
more beſides thoſe which hee there deſcribes and intends,
who will not owne any ſuch Reſignation. Therefore the difference
between the one caſe and the other, is very broad, and no leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
ſo that <hi>a reaſonable man</hi> may without any diſpraiſe to his
Reaſon, and <hi>a good Chriſtian,</hi> without any prejudice to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his Chriſtianity, demurre a while before judgement upon
the caſe.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there is no queſtion, or ground of doubting, but that a
<hi>good Chriſtian</hi> may lawfully, and with a good conſcience, ſubmit
himſelf unto a godly, able, and faithfull Paſtor, together with his
people, whom he hath good ground to judge godly, and faithfull
alſo, as well for their edification in their <hi>moſt holy faith,</hi> as for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
&amp; regulation of themſelves in matters of life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation:
But whether it be lawfull to ſubmit to any man, or any rank
or aſſociation of men, (eſpecially of men, of whoſe ſufficiencie and
faith fulneſſe in the things of God, and Jeſus Chriſt, we have either
but a very ſlender or no teſtimony at all, yea whoſe perſons are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unknowne to us) in matters which concerne the worſhip
and ſervice of God, cannot but be a queſtion, and that of great
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:124227:8"/>
moment, to all conſidering and conſcientious men, who are not
already ſatisfied in the negative part of it. The Apoſtles doe not
onely permit, but give it in charge to Chriſtians in Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
to <hi>ſubmit themſelves one to another in the feare of God, Eph.</hi> 5. 21.
<hi>i.</hi> to be yeelding, and tractable, eaſie to be intreated one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And, <hi>ſubmit your ſelves every man unto another, 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 5. If one
man ought to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to another man in this kind, much more
ought one to <hi>ſubmit</hi> unto many, and moſt of all to the whole ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Saints whereof he is a member. But as touching <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi>
unto any man, or men whatſoever in matters which concerne
the worſhip and ſervice of God, the Scripture is ſo farre from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
this upon any man, that it impoſeth the contrary, and that
with great Emphaſis and weight, <hi>Call no man your father upon earth,</hi>
(is our Saviours owne charge, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 9.) <hi>for one is your Father
which is in heaven.</hi> And in the preceding verſe, <hi>Be ye not called Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi:
for one is your maſter</hi> (or Doctor) <hi>even Chriſt, and ye all are brethren.</hi>
And the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 23. Yee are bought with a price, be ye not the
ſervants of men.</hi> He ſpeakes of a ſervility or ſubjection in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and conſcience, to the deciſions or determinations of men
in matters of conſcience and Religion. And whoſoever doth
<hi>ſubmit</hi> or ſubject himſelfe in things of this nature unto any
man or men whoſoever, that is, reſigne up his judgement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to be ordered, obliged, and tied, by the meere authority or
magiſtery of men in ſuch things, <hi>Call's men Fathers on earth, makes
himſelfe a ſervant unto men:</hi> and conſequently makes himſelf a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor
both of our Saviours injunction and charge in this behalf,
and of his Apoſtles alſo.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he that ſubmits himſelfe to a Paſtor and Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Saints for ſuch regulation as hath been mentioned, is preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to know and underſtand before-hand, of what ſpirit both the
one and the other are; how matters appertaining to the worſhip
and ſervice of God, are carried, managed, and ordered amongſt
them; ſo that he may with the full concurrence and conſent of
his judgement and conſcience, ſubmit himſelfe unto them, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
communion with them in their practice in this kind: but
what any Synod, Aſſembly, or Court of men will determine or
enjoyn in ſuch things, cannot be known before-hand by any man;
and conſequently, no man can with a good conſcience ſubmit
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:124227:9"/>
himſelfe unto them, as touching any of their determinations or
deciſions, untill he firſt underſtands what they are, and whether
according to the light and judicature of his conſcience, agreeable
to the word of God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in caſe a Paſtor and Congregation ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſo farre alter and vary from that poſture either in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
or practice, wherein they ſtood, when a man firſt joyned and
ſubmitted himſelfe unto them, that hee cannot with the peace of
his conſcience walk any longer with them, hee may with leave ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
or otherwiſe if by requeſt it cannot be obtained, withdraw
himſelfe without any inconvenience, from their communion, and
incorporate himſelfe elſwhere, as he judgeth beſt. This may bee
done with farre leſſe trouble and inconvenience, then ordinarily a
man upon a diſlike of his Parochial Paſtor, can remove out of one
Pariſh into another. But when ſuch things concerning the worſhip
and ſervice of God, which a man cannot with a good conſcience
ſubmit unto, ſhall be enacted and commanded, under mulcts and
penalties by thoſe that have power and authority over us, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
refuſe ſubjection hereunto, but at our perill, and with
the ſuſtaining of what detriment or dammage, whether in our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
liberties, or otherwiſe, as the commanders ſhall pleaſe to
impoſe. Therefore the caſe between a <hi>particular Congregation, and
the repreſentative body of a Kingdome,</hi> is farre different.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, the <hi>repreſentative Church and State of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
may (and doth ordinarily) differ from it ſelfe in poynt of
judgement touching matters of Religion) at ſeverall times, as
much as heaven and earth. Such Bodies in the dayes of Queene
<hi>Mary,</hi> and before, ſtood up for Lordly Epiſcopacie, which you
confeſſe, <hi>page</hi> 8. that Body which now is, hath by ſolemne cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
abjured. And beſides, enacted many things concerning the
worſhip &amp; ſervice of God, which other Bodies of the ſame repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
and power, have ſince repealed. And the nature and claim
of ſuch Bodies as theſe in their ſeverall ſucceſſions, is, that what
powerſoever hath been either given unto, or exerciſed by any of the
Predeceſſors, of right appertains to the Succeſſor. So that ſuppoſe
the repreſentative Body now in being, ſhall be freely and willingly
ſubmitted unto, as having a lawfull power to eſtabliſh what they
ſhall pleaſe in matters of Religion, as moſt agreeable to the word
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:124227:9"/>
of God: this ſubmiſſion doth not onely intereſſe or confirm them
in this power, but in the conſequence and conſtruction of it, is
the like intereſſing and confirmation in the ſame power, of all their
ſucceſſors, of what conſtitution or judgement ſoever they ſhall bee
for matters of Religion. Whereas for particular Independent
Congregations (<hi>loquendum ut vulgus</hi>) their preſent conſtitution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſound &amp; ſafe, as touching their members, being all in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of charity (and diſcretion too) perſons of conſcience, and of
competent underſtanding, they are not like in an ordinary way of
providence, to degenerate or decline in their ſucceſſors: and beſides,
in caſe they ſhould, their intereſt and authority over any of their
members, may at any time, and under their greateſt confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
be declin'd without any conſiderable dammage, or inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as was formerly ſhewed. So that Mr. <hi>Prynnes Truth</hi> now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
conſideration (I meane his Aſſertion ſo called) is nothing ſo
cleare, but that <hi>a rationall man</hi> may <hi>deny it;</hi> yea, the more <hi>rationall</hi>
a man is, he is the more like to <hi>deny it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Antiqueriſt having ſaid,<note place="margin">Sect. 9.</note> that <hi>the Saints think Chriſt alone is
King over his Churches, and hath not left them to Subſtitutes, &amp;c.</hi>
whereas Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> page 6. replies thus; <hi>If hee meanes it onely of
matters of Faith, or of internall government over the ſoules of men, it may
paſs as tolerable;</hi> it is (as I conceive) an expreſſion which <hi>may not paſs
as tolerable,</hi> being worſe then an ordinary <hi>error,</hi> or then more then
an ordinary <hi>miſtake.</hi> He that calls any thing <hi>tolerable,</hi> muſt needs
ſuppoſe it either to be evil, or inconvenient (at the beſt.) Now if Mr.
<hi>Prynne</hi> thinks it either <hi>evill</hi> or <hi>inconvenient,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt ſhould be King
alone over his Churches, in matters of faith and internall government of
their ſoules,</hi> it is no marvell if he ſeeks to intereſſe men in a Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power over his Churches in reſpect of their externall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
it is a marvell rather, that he ſeekes not to infringe his title
and claime even to the <hi>internall government of their ſoules</hi> alſo, and
that hee anoints not <hi>Repreſentative Bodies of Churches and States,</hi>
with authority to repeale the Articles of the old Creed, and
to enact another.</p>
            <p>Whereas (in the ſame page) hee tells his Antiqueriſt,<note place="margin">Sect. 10.</note> that <hi>hee
muſt renounce his oath of Allegeance, his late Proteſtation, and Nationall
Vow and Covenant, make foure or five Canonicall Scriptures Apocrypha,</hi>
with ſome ſuch other mormolukies as theſe, if he <hi>thinkes Chriſt to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:124227:10"/>
be King alone over his Churches,</hi> in point of <hi>externall Eccleſiaſticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
Diſcipline, or Order;</hi> I conceive this conſequence of his to
be inconſequent &amp; <hi>a miſtake.</hi> For firſt, the Scriptures he ſpecifies, <hi>Rom</hi>
13. 1. to 6. 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 13. 14. Tit. 3. 1. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. ſpeake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Government,</hi> nor of any ſubjection unto
Kings or Rulers in matters of Conſcience, or Religion; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of that obedience which is due unto them in civill things: yea
ſome of them (the laſt by name) not ſo much as of either. And
ſecondly, for the <hi>Nationall vow and Covenant,</hi> doubtleſſe they that
took and ſware that, did not abjure the abſolute Monarchicall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
power of Chriſt over his Churches, nor did they ſwear
homage or fealty to any other Lord or Lords, but with a <hi>Salvo
jure, &amp;c.</hi> ſaving the rights and priviledges of the Lord Paramount,
Jeſus Chriſt; amongſt which that is one of the moſt <hi>undoubted</hi>
ones, to have the <hi>ſole dominion over the faith</hi> and conſciences of men,
eſpecially in things concerning the worſhip and ſervice of God.
And thirdly and laſtly, for the <hi>Oath of Allegeance,</hi> and <hi>late Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation,</hi>
either there is nothing contained in either of theſe, but what
is of a cleare and perfect conſiſtence with this <hi>ſole dominion of
Chriſt over the faith and conſciences of men:</hi> or if there be, the renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of them will be more honourable and ſafe for Chriſtians, then
their taking of them was, or then their ſtanding by their ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in that kind will be.</p>
            <p>But whereas (page 7.)<note place="margin">Sect. 11.</note> he affirmes, that <hi>Chriſt hath delegated his
Kingly power to Chriſtian Kings, Magiſtrates, and higheſt civill pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi>
as likewiſe <hi>bequeathed his Propheticall Office unto Miniſters:</hi> theſe
<hi>certo certius</hi> are <hi>errors</hi> in the higheſt, <hi>undermining</hi> (I ſhall not abate,
<hi>wilfully and preſumptuouſly,</hi> in the reckoning) <hi>the undoubted privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi>
of the Throne of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>by the very roots.</hi> For are not
the Offices of Chriſt incommunicable? appropriable only unto him
who is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God &amp; Man, and Mediator? Or is Chriſt retired
from the throne of his glory, to live privatly as a Recluſe, to ſolace
&amp; enjoy himſelfe in ſome ſolitary angle or by-corner of heaven? Or
hath he eas'd his ſhoulder of that great burthen of the government
of the world, which was laid by God upon it, devolving it upon the
ſhoulders of others? Where is then the promiſe of the <hi>Everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
of his Kingdome, and of the <hi>continuance of his dominion through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all ages?</hi> And where is the prediction of his <hi>delivering up his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:124227:10"/>
Kingdome unto his Father,</hi> if he hath <hi>delivered</hi> it up (or down rather)
unto men? Surely he means to call for it againe out of their hands,
before that day. But if <hi>Kings and Magiſtrates have the Kingly Power
of Chriſt delegated unto them,</hi> they have <hi>all power given unto them both
in Heaven and Earth,</hi> and conſequently have not onely a right and
lawfullneſſe of Authoritie to command as well all the Angels of
Heaven, as men on Earth, but alſo to incline and bow the hearts
of both, to the willing execution &amp; fulfilling of thoſe commands.
And if ſo, let them impoſe what Eccleſiaſticall Government or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline
they pleaſe, they may, if they pleaſe, be obeyed and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto upon what terms, with what willingneſſe and readineſſe,
and by whom they deſire. And if <hi>Miniſters</hi> be inveſted <hi>in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall
office of Chriſt,</hi> how dares M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Prynne</hi> refuſe to hearken unto
them? or ingage himſelf in a theologicall warre againſt them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no part or fellowſhip in this <hi>office</hi> himſelf? Will he ſubject the
ſpirit of the Prophets, yea, of thoſe that prophecie in the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and by the vertue of <hi>the Propheticall office of Chriſt,</hi> unto himſelf,
and his own ſpirit, being no Prophet at all? <hi>Letentur tenebrae, eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſcat

            </p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Sect. 12.</note> whereas (in the ſame page) he votes, that <hi>if any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
a certain odd kind of <hi>veritie</hi> (ſo called and aſſerted by him) <hi>he muſt
renounce not onely his Chriſtianitie, but his Allegeance and Humanitie
too;</hi> I utterly <hi>renounce</hi> the conſequence, conceiving it to be <hi>tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
with an abſolute miſtake. For a man may deny, that <hi>every
Chriſtian in point of Conſcience is bound by the expreſſe reſolution of Rom.</hi>
13. 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14, 15. (with ſeverall other Scriptures as little to the
purpoſe) <hi>without any danger of blind obedience, to lawfull decreas, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant
to Gods Word, &amp;c.</hi> without <hi>renouncing,</hi> yea, or ſo much as a
ſhew of <hi>renouncing his Chriſtianitie</hi> (and much more of his <hi>Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>)
For what hath a mans <hi>humanitie</hi> to doe with <hi>the expreſſe reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. to 6. <hi>Ezra. 7. 26. Joſh.</hi> 1. 16, 17, &amp;c. Or what hath
the <hi>expreſſe Reſolution</hi> of theſe and other Texts, to preſerve a mans
<hi>Chriſtianitie</hi> from <hi>the danger of bind obedience,</hi> even <hi>to lawfull decrees,</hi>
in caſe the lawfulneſſe of them be not ſeene, nor ſo much as exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by thoſe that ſubmit unto them? A man is in the ſame <hi>danger
of blind obedience,</hi> as well in reſpect of lawfull, as unlawfull decrees.
Yea, a man that after a ſerious and conſcientious debate, ſhall upon
a miſtaken ground ſubmit unto an unlawfull <hi>decree,</hi> acquits himſelf
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:124227:11"/>
more like a Chriſtian, and with better acceptation unto God by
following the light of his conſcience upon ſuch terms, then he that
ſhall ſubject himſelf unto a <hi>lawfull decree,</hi> without knowing, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to know, what, why, or wherefore he ſo doth.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Sect. 13.</note> Whereas (in the ſame page) he taxeth the Anti-que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt

nothing els but the <hi>preſuming</hi> of an <hi>overſight,</hi> where none is. For he
that ſaith thus, <hi>Suppoſe the whole Parliament and Synod ſhould erre in

            <p>Nor is that marginall note in the ſame page excuſable at any
lower rate then a miſtake of that kind,<note place="margin">Sect. 14.</note> which they that ſpeak ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly,
are wont to call an <hi>untruth;</hi> which chargeth the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

the</hi> Presbyterians <hi>blindly to ſubmit unto it, as the onely way of Chriſt.</hi>
Never was a poor innocent margin compell'd to carry a more guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Annotation then this. It is the firſt-born of abhorrencies in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency,
to compell any man <hi>blindly to ſubmit</hi> unto any thing.
That infinuation following, is an arrow ſhot from the ſame bow,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the Anti-queriſt and <hi>his, oppoſe and prejudicate both the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments

            </p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>p.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 15.</note> 8. becauſe the two Brethren in their Reply to <hi>A. S.</hi>
uſed this expreſſion concerning the Congregationall Government,
that <hi>in time it cannot but overthrow all other ſorts of Eccleſiaſticall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
he gathers upon them with this inſulting Interrogatory;
<hi>Is it not then a turbulent, dangerous, ſchiſmaticall, unquiet</hi> (that I ſay
not, inſufferable) <hi>Government by your own confeſſions, which will admit
no equall nor corrivall, &amp;c.</hi> is not this, either through weakneſſe of
underſtanding, or ſtrength of a worſe principle, an <hi>inſufferable</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:124227:11"/>
Or can it but call to remembrance, that teſtimony of
thoſe two againſt our Saviour (who are call'd <hi>falſe witneſſes</hi> for
their labour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 60.) wherein they teſtified, that he had ſaid,
<hi>I can deſtroy the Temple of God, and build it againe in three dayes,</hi> as if
he had ſpake concerning the materiall Temple, whereas it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 21. that <hi>he ſpake concerning the Temple of his body?</hi>
In like manner, what the two Brethren ſpake (as is moſt apparent
in the paſſage cited by him from <hi>p.</hi> 111. of the ſaid Reply) concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the finall prevailing of the Congregationall Government over
other Governments, by reaſon of that affinitie which it hath with
the Truth, and <hi>conſonancy with the word of God,</hi> this man will needs
interpret, as if they ſpake it in reſpect of ſome fierce, fiery, turbulent
&amp; domineering ſpirit, wherewith that way of Government ſhould
be haunted or inſpired above all others; yea, his pen bluſheth not
to avouch (in effect) that themſelves confeſſe as much. The whole
paſſage in the ſaid <hi>Reply,</hi> that the Reader may the better judge, is
this; <hi>Indeed, by the beauty and perfect conſonancy of this Government to
the word of God, it may very reaſonably (yea and upon higher terms then
of reaſon,</hi> meaning I ſuppoſe, of Faith) <hi>be thought that in time it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but overthrow all ſorts of Eccleſiaſticall Government, and ſtand up it
ſelf in their ſtead.</hi> Thoſe words in this period, <hi>it cannot but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
all ſorts of Church-Government,</hi> they borrow from the pen of
their Adverſary, (as appeares by their different character) in which
reſpect, for a man confederate with him in the ſame cauſe, to put a
ſiniſter or malevolent conſtruction upon them, though uſed by his
oppoſites, is very unnaturall, and a breach of ingenuitie (I verily
beleeve) without preſident.</p>
            <p>Whereas a few lines after,<note place="margin">Sect. 16.</note> he vapours thus; <hi>Will any Parliament,
State, or Nation</hi> (think you) <hi>ſuffer ſuch a Government to take root a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, which will un-King, un-Parliament, un-Church, un-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
them altogether, and make each ſeverall Congregation an abſolute
Monarchie, Church, &amp;c.</hi> A man would think he were calling for
the making of <hi>three Tabernacles, one for Moſes, and one for Elias,</hi> and
a third for himſelf, <hi>not knowing</hi> indeed <hi>what he ſpeaketh.</hi> In caſe a

to worſhip and ſerve God in ſuch a way, wherein they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the peace of their conſciences being tender, is ſuch a permiſſion
as this, of any ſuch formidable aſpect, as to threaten, either the un-Kinging
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:124227:12"/>
               <hi>of a State, or the un-Parliamenting of a Parliament, or the
un-Nationing of a Nation, or the un-Churching of a Church?</hi> Or are
ſuch perſons more likely, or upon terms of any moe advantage (in
caſe their inclinations ſtood for it) to bring any of theſe doomes-dayes
upon a State or Nation, when they are permitted to worſhip
and ſerve God with peaceableneſſe of Conſcience, then they would
be, in caſe they were compelled contrary to their Conſcience in
both? Surely the man to whom the <hi>ſhadowes of the mountaines ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

            <p>Whereas <hi>p.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 18.</note> 9. he ſo much rejoyceth over that ſaying of his own,
<hi>That there is no example of gathering Independent Congregations, not of
Infidels, but of men already converted to, &amp; ſetled in the Chriſtian Faith,
unleſſe derived from the private Conventicles,</hi> of <hi>Arrians, Novations,
Donatiſts, and other Heretiques, who yet were not Independent among
themſelves;</hi> as if it were <hi>a true</hi> ſaying indeed, and <hi>onely bitter to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,
becauſe undeniable;</hi> the truth is, that the truth of it (were
it granted) will hardly equall the duſt in the ballance, to make the
cauſe he maintains weight. He that ſaith, <hi>there is no example of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
Independent Congregations of men already converted to, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the Chriſtian Faith, unleſſe derived, &amp;c.</hi> muſt needs ſuppoſe and
grant, that there <hi>are examples of gathering ſuch Congregations of men
not yet ſetled in the Chriſtian Faith, which are not ſo derived, &amp;c.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the tenor of that knowne maxime; <hi>Exceptio firm it Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam
in non exceptis.</hi> He that ſhould ſay thus, there is no example of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:124227:12"/>
any man truly ſanctified, that ever finally apoſtatis'd from his
Chriſtian profeſſion; implies and grants, that there are or may be
examples of perſons never truly ſanctified, who did ſo apoſtatiſe.
Now if there be <hi>examples of gathering Independent Congregations,</hi> of
men onely <hi>converted to the Chriſtian Faith,</hi> though not yet eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
or <hi>ſetled</hi> in it, other then thoſe <hi>that are derived from the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Heretiques;</hi> it is an argument of more ſtrength to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
the Congregationall Government, then any M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Prynne</hi> hath
brought either to diſable that, or to ſtrengthen the other, in whoſe
defence his pen ſo much triumpheth. Suppoſe the Apoſtles did
build up or gather <hi>Independent</hi> Churches or <hi>Congregations</hi> onely of
perſons newly <hi>converted to the Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and not of ſuch as
had been <hi>ſetled</hi> herein, yet 1. this amounts to an expreſſe patterne
of (and conſequently to a ſufficient warrant for) <hi>gathering Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Congregations</hi> ſimply, or in ſuch caſes, wherein there is not
<hi>error in perſonis.</hi> Nay, 2. if theſe Apoſtolicall <hi>Independent Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
did at their firſt gathering or framing conſiſt onely of perſons
lately <hi>Infidells,</hi> and as yet <hi>newly converted unto,</hi> and not <hi>ſetled</hi> in
<hi>Chriſtianitie,</hi> yet afterwards, the ſame <hi>Congregations</hi> muſt needs be
ſuppoſed to conſiſt of perſons <hi>ſetled</hi> in Chriſtianitie alſo, unleſſe we
will ſuppoſe either that ſuch as were <hi>converted</hi> by the Apoſtles to
the Faith, were never either by them, or any others <hi>ſetled</hi> herein;
or els that upon ſuch <hi>ſetling</hi> of them, their <hi>Congregations</hi> were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
broken up and diſſolved, or els ſpecifically chang'd in their
Government. Either of which ſuppoſitions, though to others they
may be but as <hi>gnats,</hi> eaſie to be <hi>ſwallowed,</hi> yet to me they are <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mells,</hi>
I cannot get them downe. So that we ſee M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Prynne</hi> hath
gotten nothing yet by his <hi>true undeniable paſſage,</hi> (for which
notwithſtanding, he ſcarcely refraineth from ſacrificing unto his
pen) but onely the <hi>giving</hi> of his adverſaries ſuch an argument for
their cauſe, which he will never be able to take away from them.
And whereas in the latter part of this <hi>paſſage,</hi> he would inſinuate,
(that which more plainly he affirms a few periods after) that thoſe
<hi>that gather Independent Congregations, derive their practiſe from the
examples, of Novatians, Donatiſts, and other Heretiques;</hi> whom yet
he denies to have been <hi>Independent amongst themſelves;</hi> it is as if he
ſhould challenge women that are modeſt and chaſte, for <hi>deriving</hi>
their behaviour from the <hi>example</hi> of <hi>Joſephs</hi> Miſtreſſe, or ſervants
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:124227:13"/>
that were loyall and faithfull to their Maſters, for imitating the
practiſe of <hi>Judas Iſcariot.</hi> Now ſince the <hi>paſſage</hi> we wot of, whilſt
ſuppoſed <hi>true and undeniable,</hi> doth us more ſervice, then the evicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <note place="margin">Sect. 19.</note> 10. he demands, <hi>Why the Nationall Church of the Jews
under the Old Teſtament, ſhould not be a patterne for us to imitate, as

(I conceive) carries an <hi>error</hi> (or at leaſt a <hi>miſtake</hi>) in the
ground and foundation of it. It ſuppoſeth, that we <hi>covenant, faſt,
keep Sabbath, &amp;c.</hi> onely in imitation of that <hi>Nation,</hi> who did the
like, and that we have no other ground for theſe practiſes, but the
<hi>nationalitie</hi> of the like obſervations amongſt the <hi>Jews:</hi> whereas if
we had no better foundation for them then this, the nationall I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries
of that people would be <hi>a patterne for us to imitate,</hi> as well
as theſe. If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Prynne</hi> will needs have the <hi>Nationall Church</hi> of the
<hi>Jews, a pattern for us to imitate,</hi> let him procure an Injunction from
Heaven for the imitation, and we are ready to joyne iſſue with
him.</p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>p.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 20.</note> 11. he ſaith, that wicked <hi>members of a Church, when
excommunicated, after they are baptized, do not actually ceaſe to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
&amp;c.</hi> Certainly it is a miſtake, one or more, if <hi>nihil ſupra.</hi> For 1.
if ſuch <hi>members when excommunicated, doe not actually ceaſe to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
I would know whether then they ceaſe to be ſuch <hi>potentially</hi>
onely? If ſo, they ceaſed thus to be <hi>members,</hi> as ſoone as ever they
became <hi>members;</hi> they were then <hi>in potentiâ remotâ</hi> of ceaſing to be
<hi>members,</hi> as a man is of dying, as ſoone as he is borne: or if we ſpeak
of <hi>potentia propinqua,</hi> they thus ceas'd to be <hi>members,</hi> upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of thoſe ſins, which rendered them juſtly obnoxious either
unto <hi>excommunication</hi> by the Church, or unto death by the Civill
Magiſtrate, before either of theſe cenſures or ſentences paſs'd upon
them. Therefore if they <hi>actually ceaſe not to be members when excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,</hi>
they <hi>ceaſe not at all to be members;</hi> or at leaſt no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
then they ceaſed to be before ſuch <hi>excommunication:</hi> and if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
what doe we with this learned impertinencie, <hi>actually?</hi> But
2. if wicked <hi>members when excommunicated, doe not actually ceaſe to be
members,</hi> I marvaile our Saviour ſhould allow them no better quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:124227:13"/>
amongſt their fellows, then to be look'd upon as <hi>Heathens and

actuall members</hi> of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Prynnes</hi> Presbyterian Church; yea, though
they be by the higheſt hand the Church can lift up, caſt out of it.
<hi>Ne verè, ne me ad tales compellite coetus.</hi> And 3. and laſtly, what my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious
notion he ſhould intend to let in, or what dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
he ſhould intend to ſhut out by that emphaticall inſertion, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they are baptized,</hi> is out of the hemiſphere of my apprehenſion.
All that I can work out of it, is this; that there is or may be a two-fold
excommunication of the members in a Chriſtian Church;
one, before they are <hi>baptized,</hi> and another, <hi>after:</hi> and that by the
power of the former excommunication, they actually ceaſe to be
members of their reſpective Churches; not ſo by vertue of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which (it ſeems) is either more indulgent, or leſſe vigorous
and active. If this be M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Prynnes</hi> Doctrine, it is moſt properly and
peculiarly his; <hi>Libera per primos poſuit veſtigia Princeps:</hi> if it be
not his, <hi>Senſum &amp; ſententiam veſtram, ô verba,</hi> after they are
baptized.</p>
            <p>Whereas immediately after,<note place="margin">Sect. 21</note> he argues thus, that ſince <hi>none ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the Churches of Epheſus, Coloſſe, Smyrna,</hi> and <hi>though they
had ſome corruptions and evill members, therefore for us to ſeparate from,
and un-church ſuch Nationall or Parochiall Churches, which have ſuch
members in them, is to un-church all Churches in the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp;c.</hi> He commits as many <hi>errors</hi> in arguing, as a man ſhall
lightly meet with within ſuch a compaſſe of words. For 1. he muſt
be beholding either to an abundant weakneſſe or charitie (th'one)
in his Reader, to obtaine the grant of that which is the baſe or riſe
of this whole argumentation, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>none ſeparated from the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Epheſus, Coloſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Negative proofes from the Scripture in
this caſe are not concluding. But ſuppoſe <hi>charitie</hi> ſhould <hi>cover</hi> the
nakedneſſe or weakneſſe of this ſuppoſition, and paſſe it as a truth,
yet 2. that ſuch a ſuppoſition ſhould argue, that <hi>to ſeparate from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
or Parochiall Churches which have evill members in them, is to
un-church all Churches in the old and new Teſtament,</hi> hath neither
head, nor foot, neither body nor ſoule of reaſon in it. For 1. they
who <hi>ſeparate from a Nationall Church,</hi> ſuppoſing no place or ground
for ſuch a Church under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> have no ground or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
but to judge that ſuch a Church was lawfull, and truly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:124227:14"/>
under the old: as they who now ſeparate themſelves from Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
and other Judaicall obſervations, as ſuperſtitious and
highly diſpleaſing unto God, doe in no reaſonable conſtruction
hereby deny, but that ſometimes they were, or might have been, a
legitimate and acceptable worſhip unto him. 2. Nor is there any ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
or ſtrength of reaſon at all in this poſition; <hi>they who ſeparate
from a Nationall or Parochiall Church, which have wicked members in
them, doe therefore ſeparate, becauſe of theſe members,</hi> more then there
is in this; they who avoid the company of men with heads, doe
therefore avoid them, becauſe they have heads. There may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
more then enough, of ſeparating either <hi>from a Nationall, or from
a Parochiall Church,</hi> beſides the wickedneſſe of ſome of <hi>the members
of them:</hi> yea, I doe not conceive that ever any man ſeparated from
either of theſe Churches, <hi>Nationall or Parochiall,</hi> ſimply or ſolely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ground: nor doe I judge it a ſufficient cauſe of ſeparation
from either. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Prynne</hi> himſelf hath ſeparated from the Church of
<hi>England</hi> as Epiſcopall, and hath given the ſtrength of his aſſiſtance
to caſt it into another frame or mould of Government, whereby it
will ſpecifically differ from it ſelf: and yet it is a plain caſe, that he
hath not made this <hi>ſeparation</hi> from it, becauſe of the wickedneſſe of
ſome of the members that were in it, whilſt Epiſcopall; becauſe it
is like to have many of this character, in caſe it ſhall be torkened to
Presbyterall. Therefore a man <hi>may ſeparate either from a Nationall
or Parochiall Church which have wicked members in it, without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching</hi>
(yea, or diſparaging) <hi>any Church at all, either in the Old
or New Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>p.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 22.</note> 12. he collects thus; <hi>If Independents denie that there
were diverſe particular Congregations at Jeruſalem, then they muſt prove,
that all the Apoſtles and Elders at Jeruſalem, were Paſtors but of one and
the ſelf-ſame Individuall Congregation;</hi> it is at leaſt a <hi>miſtake,</hi> though
pardonable in a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> yet not in a <hi>Logician.</hi> For 1. ſuppoſe there
were <hi>diverſe particular Congregations at Jeruſalem,</hi> it doth not follow,
therefore all the Elders belonging to theſe ſeverall Congregations,
were <hi>Paſtors</hi> of them, except we ſtretch the ſignification of the
word, <hi>Paſtor,</hi> beyond the Staple of the Scriptures, (as <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
I confeſſe, uſually doe to help themſelves at a dead lift) and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it unto all manner of Governours and Officers in the Church.
And conſequently, a pluralitie of <hi>Congregations at Jeruſalem</hi> may be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:124227:14"/>
denied; though no proofe or ſuppoſition be made, that <hi>all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
and Elders at Jeruſalem, were PASTORS to one Individuall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi>
2. A pluralitie of <hi>Congregations</hi> ſuppoſed, it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that all, or any of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> were <hi>Paſtors</hi> unto any of them;
<hi>Paſtors and Apoſtles</hi> being contra-diſtinguiſhed, <hi>Eph. 4. 11. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors and
Teachers.</hi> The Apoſtles had a Commiſſion to preach unto any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church, or Churches, without being made Paſtors unto
them: yea, himſelf afterwards in this very page confeſſeth, that <hi>the
Apoſtles were not immediate Miniſters or Paſtors to particular Churches.</hi>
Therefore M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Prynnes</hi> collection (however) faulters. 3. (And laſtly)
The preſence or continuance of ſo many of the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
for a time (for that <hi>all</hi> the Apoſtles ſhould be preſent at the

that their ſtay there was ſo much either for the Government or

of one or more Congregations, as for the generall accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Goſpel, and of the affaires of all particular Churches
elſewhere; this Citie being their Head-quarter, or Rendevouz, from
whence upon occaſion they might, and did the more commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
iſſue forth by parties into other parts, upon their ſpirituall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
as God called them, or gave opportunitie. So that there is
no neceſſitie at all lying upon them, who conceive that there was
onely one <hi>Congregation at Jeruſalem,</hi> to prove, that <hi>all the Apoſtles

He tells me <hi>p.</hi> 24. of my <hi>Independent fabrique faſtened toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

it will drop one piece from another, and the honour of it ſoone lie
in the duſt. The inference which he would make by way of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,

(ſaith he) <hi>what becomes of their independent Churches, which have no

through ſuch a defect, I hope thoſe will not be juſtified. But
how effeminate and looſe a conſequence is this: The Church at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
had Apoſtles and Elders to be the Paſtors of it: therefore
that Church that hath not both Apoſtles and Elders to be the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
of it, is or can be no true Church; as if Paſtors made of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
(in caſe there had been ſuch) had been of the eſſence of the
Church at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> If either Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> or any other, ſhall ſhew

            <p>Whereas (<hi>p.</hi>

Controverſies, ſettle, order all Church-affaires, &amp;c. in the frequent Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Nationall Aſſemblies, Synods—among the Iſraelites, preſcribed,

(the prime place produced by him to prove his <hi>Generall Nationall
Aſſemblies, Synods, amongst the Iſraelites, preſcribed, appointed by God</hi>)
is neither there, nor any where elſe in Scripture ſaid to have been

but only reſolved upon the ſending to, and gathering together the
Prieſts and Levites, with the generalitie of the people of the Land

never queſtioned the lawfulneſs of ſuch Aſſemblies, Synods, as theſe,
but onely the lawfulneſſe of ſome power, which ſome of theſe claim
and exerciſe. 4. Nor did this, nor any other <hi>Generall Nationall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
Synod,</hi> any where to be found in Scripture, ever enact any
thing concerning the worſhip and ſervice of God, under mulcts and
penalties, but what God himſelf had plainly determined and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:124227:15"/>
to be done, in his Law. Nor was this done by any ſelect
<hi>Aſſembly, Synod,</hi> conſiſting onely of Prieſts and Levites, or of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
voted into places of Authoritie by the generalitie of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

together, with an uniforme, full and free conſent and approbation
on all hands. It is ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 9, 10. 12, 13, &amp;c. (another
Scripture cited by Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> to prove the aforeſaid gain-ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion)
that <hi>all Judah and Benjamin, and the ſtrangers with them
out of Ephraim, and Manaſſeh, and out of Simeon, gathered themſelves
together at Jeruſalem, And entered into a Covenant to ſeek the Lord God
of their Fathers, with all their heart, and with all their ſoule, That
whoſoever would not ſeek the Lord God of Iſrael, ſhould be put to death,

Here is no compelling of any man by any <hi>Authoritative Synod</hi> of

not any matter <hi>of doubtfull diſputation,</hi> any determination of the

it was the effect of the firſt &amp; greateſt commandement of this Law;
Some lively ſparkes and impreſſions whereof remaine to this day in

            <p>Whereas (page 13.<note place="margin">Sect. 24.</note>) from the words of his Antagoniſt there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
he drawes this concluſion, <hi>Therefore the Infant-Church in the
Apoſtles dayes was not ſo compleat, perfect in all points, as the multiplied
or grown Churches afterwards,</hi> either he amphibologizeth, or elſe his
concluſion is an abſolute <hi>miſtake</hi> in reference to his purpoſe. For
though the <hi>Infant-church in the Apoſtles dayes,</hi> that is, Chriſtian
Churches in their firſt bud and ſpring, in and about the beginning
of the <hi>Apoſtles dayes,</hi> and their firſt going forth into the world to
preach the Goſpell, <hi>were not ſo compleat, perfect in all points,</hi> as either
the ſame, or other Churches were afterwards, viz. towards the
<hi>later</hi> dayes of the Apoſtles in the world, when they had ſupplied
and added all things neceſſary, and any wayes appertaining to the
beauty and well-being of theſe Churches in point of Government
and Diſcipline; yet it follows not from hence, that either theſe, or
any other ſucceeding Churches after the Apoſtles dayes, how <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
or grown</hi> ſoever, ever <hi>grew</hi> to more beauty or perfection in
point of government, then theſe had attained unto, before the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
were taken away by death from them. This <hi>concluſion</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
if Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> could have made lawfull prize of it, from the
premiſes of his adverſary, would have ſmiled a little upon his
cauſe: but for the other, it holds no correſpondencie at all with it,
but rather frowns upon it. For if the Apoſtles left the Churches of
Chriſt in the perfection of beauty for matter of government, it muſt
needs follow, that any variation from that forme of government
wherein they left them, is rather matter of deformity then <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas (in the ſame page) he affirmes with an high hand,<note place="margin">Sect. 25.</note> 
               <hi>that
if the Parliament and Synod ſhall by publicke conſent eſtabliſh a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
Church-government, as moſt conſonant to Gods word, —Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents
and all others are bound in conſcience to ſubmit unto it, under
pain of obſtinacie, ſingularity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in caſe they cannot really, by direct
texts, and precepts, prove it diametrically contrary to the Scripture.</hi> —I
conceive it to be a <hi>jeofaile</hi> in Theologie, a <hi>miſtake</hi> in ſtead of a
truth. For firſt, a man is not bound in conſcience to doe any thing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:124227:16"/>
that is commanded, though both the authority whereby it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
yea and the thing it ſelfe which is commanded, be never ſo
lawfull, whilſt his judgement and conſcience remain conſiderably
doubtfull, and unſatisfied touching the lawfulneſſe of it, eſpecially
whilſt they vehemently incline to thinke and judge the contrary;
leaſt of all, whilſt the contrary is the abſolute and unqueſtioned
deciſion of both; yea, though the grounds of ſuch a doubt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
bee never ſo inſufficient and weake. The Scripture is
cleare in this, <hi>Let every man be fully perſwaded</hi> (or aſſured) <hi>in his own
mind,</hi> or underſtanding, (viz. concerning the lawfulnes of what he
doth) &amp; not build upon, or content himſelf with the mind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding

that no man is <hi>bound in conſcience, under pain of obſtinacie, ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

in men, will ſuffer to be bound upon them in this caſe. The Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cees
were bound to beleeve the reſurrection of the dead by vertue
of this text, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the
God of Jacob,</hi> Exod. 3. 6. wherein notwithſtanding there is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
or expreſſe mention made of this reſurrection, as appears <hi>Mat.</hi>
22. 31, 32. In like manner the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were bound to think it a
matter of duty to miniſter in their <hi>carnall things,</hi> unto thoſe that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:124227:17"/>
               <hi>ſowed ſpirituall things unto them,</hi> by vertue &amp; warrant of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox that tradeth out the
Corn, Deu.</hi> 25. 4. (as appears 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 8, 9.) &amp; yet evident it is, that the
<hi>direct</hi> letter of ſuch a duty is not here to be found. What propoſition
ſoever, ſhall, or may be found to be a legitimate and native conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
or deduction from any text in Scripture being found, ought
to be of the ſame ſacred conſideration unto us, and according to
the tenor of it, of the ſame obligation upon us, with that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ground
from whence it iſſueth and is derived. <hi>For if the firſt
fruits bee holy, ſo is the whole lump: and if the root bee holy, ſo are the
branches, Rom.</hi> 11. 16. Therefore that Church-government which
ſhall be overthrowne by a <hi>direct</hi> and pregnant conſequence from a
<hi>text,</hi> is as ſufficiently overthrowne, as if the defeat had been given
by the moſt <hi>direct</hi> and expreſſe letter of ſuch a <hi>text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas (page 14.)<note place="margin">Sect. 26.</note> hee ſuperaddes this notion (in a paſſage
much of the ſame import with the laſt brought under examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
that <hi>though the eſtabliſhment of a government by the Parliament
and Aſſembly, doth not bind all Independents to be ſimply of their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet it binds them in point of practice and obedience outwardly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and not to ſeparate under pain of arrogancie, faction, ſchiſme, unleſſe
they can clearly manifeſt it to be abſolutely unlawfull and repagnant to
the Scriptures.</hi> I conceive he addes unto his <hi>miſtakes,</hi> if not unto his
<hi>errors.</hi> For firſt, whereas he here ſuppoſeth, that Independenters
muſt <hi>ſeparate</hi> from the government that ſhall bee eſtabliſhed by
Parliament and Aſſembly, (and ſo muſt undergoe the <hi>pains</hi> and
penalties impoſed upon that crime by the law of his pen) in caſe
they doe not, or ſhall not ſubmit unto it, hee ſhould have done
well to conſider, that <hi>ſeparation</hi> ſtill preſuppoſeth former union.
<hi>Thoſe whom God hath joyned together, let not man ſeparate,</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 19. 6.</note> 
               <hi>or put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder.</hi>
That woman cannot bee divorced, nor yet forſake her
husband, which never was married; no more can Independents
be ſaid (unleſſe by ſaying that which had been better unſaid) to
<hi>ſeparate</hi> from that government unto which they never were yet u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited.
Therefore let Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> and all other of the Presbyterian
judgement, know aſſuredly, that they will never gain any thing
but the <hi>wages of unrighteouſneſſe</hi> by charging their brethren of the
Congregationall way, either with <hi>ſeparation</hi> or <hi>ſchiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, to affirme, that <hi>a man though he be not of their opinion,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:124227:17"/>
who ſhall eſtabliſh a Government</hi> (he muſt meane, touching the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of the Government ſo eſtabliſhed, or elſe it is nothing to
the purpoſe) <hi>is yet bound in point of outward practiſe and obedience to
ſubmit thereunto,</hi> is a note beyond that <hi>Elah</hi> of the Familiſts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they teach, that if a man ſhall keep his heart and mind ſound
and uncorrupted within, he may for his ſafety or accommodation
otherwiſe, comply outwardly with any Idolatrous worſhips or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions,
or other unlawfull practiſes whatſoever. This gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
it ſelf, doth not hold ſuch an outward compliance as this,
ſimply neceſſary, in point of dutie or conſcience, but onely lawfull
in point of Chriſtian libertie. Therefore M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynne</hi> wades deeper
into theſe polluted waters, then they.</p>
            <p>3. And (laſtly) whereas he thinks ſufficiently to <hi>proviſo</hi> his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
aſſertion, by adding, <hi>unleſſe they can cleerly manifeſt it to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
unlawfull and repugnant to the Scriptures;</hi> the truth is, that
here is neither ſhield nor buckler that can ſaye it harmleſſe. For
1. it is not the truth or ſoundneſſe of a mans judgement ſtanding
in oppoſition to the ſuppoſed or aſſerted lawfulneſſe of a thing,
that makes the practiſe of the thing, during the preſent ſtate of his
judgement, unlawfull to him; but the very tenor or ſtate of his
judgement in reſpect of ſuch oppoſition, whether this ſtate of it be
good or bad, ſound or unſound. Much leſſe 2. is it an abilitie in
men to <hi>manifeſt</hi> unto others the truth or ſoundneſſe of their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
when they ſtand bent againſt a practiſe that is injoyned as
lawfull, that onely can excuſe them from ſubjection. Mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are not to be regulated either by a Rhetoricall or Logicall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
of expreſſing themſelves or their judgements to the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ſatisfaction of others; but by thoſe impreſſions of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
and equitie that are in and upon their judgements, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be able to repreſent or commend them for ſuch unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or no.<note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> were not able <hi>cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to manifeſt</hi> it unto <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> and his <hi>Nobles,</hi> that it was <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
unlawfull</hi> for them to fall downe and worſhip the golden
Image which he had ſet up: yet was it not therefore unlawfull for
them to refuſe ſubjection unto the Kings commandement in that
behalf. If the lawfulneſſe of our refuſing our Superiours in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
and commands, be ſuſpended upon our abilitie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them of the unlawfulneſſe of theſe commands, there will not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:124227:18"/>
be much danger in it to bid the Papiſts <hi>God ſpeed,</hi> when they bring
the Doctrine of <hi>blind obedience</hi> unto us. Rare are thoſe ſuperiours,
that care to impoſe any thing by way of command, of the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
whereof they can be willing to be convinced, eſpecially by
the commanded: and where there is no diſpoſition, no willingneſſe
towards a conviction, arguments and demonſtrations are (for the
moſt part) but <hi>as ſounding braſſe,</hi> and <hi>tinkling cymballs. Leviathan</hi>
in regard of the ſtrength and toughneſſe of his skin and ſcales,
<hi>eſteemeth iron as ſtraw, and braſſe as rotten wood: The arrow cannot

Job 41. 27, 28.</p>
            <p>Whereas (<hi>p.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 27.</note> 14.) he ſaith, that <hi>if the Parliament ſhould ſettle In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependencie,
I am certain you would then write and preach for univerſall
obedience to it, without diſpute;</hi> doubtleſſe this certaintie of his is but
a confident miſtake; For 1. it is no wayes conſiſtent with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of that Government he ſpeaks of, to urge or preſſe <hi>univerſall
obedience</hi> to it; becauſe it profeſſeth an abſolute incapacitie in farre
the greateſt part of men (for the preſent) for it; nor doth it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that the <hi>univerſalitie</hi> of men will ever become capable of it.
This Government pleadeth for no ſubjection to it, but from thoſe
that are Saints, at leaſt in view, ſuch I mean, who <hi>doe</hi> not in <hi>works</hi>
or <hi>deeds denie that Faith,</hi> which in <hi>words they profeſſe.</hi> Such as theſe
the Scripture pronounceth to be <hi>worſe then Infidells:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 8.</note> and therefore
whilſt ſuch, they are not capable of part &amp; fellowſhip in that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which is appropriate to the Kingdome, or Churches of
Chriſt. Nevertheleſſe, it earneſtly prayeth for, and by every other
good way and means is ready to endevour the converſion of theſe
unto God: onely it judgeth not meet to bring them into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
untill they be purified.</p>
            <p>Nor 2. doth this Government preſſe for ſubjection unto it from
the Saints themſelves, <hi>without diſpute:</hi> it cares for no Proſelytes,
but for thoſe that are firſt inſtructed, and made diſciples. It diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daignes
ſo far to undervalue its beautie and lovelineſſe, as to raviſh
or force the conſcience of any man.</p>
            <p>Whereas (<hi>p.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 28.</note> 16.) he makes it <hi>an apparent ſchiſme, ſeparation from
all other Churches, for Independent Churches to appeale onely to Churches
of their own partie;</hi> I conceive it is a repetition of a former <hi>miſtake,</hi>
with the augmentation of a new. For 1. there is no place for the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:124227:18"/>
crimes of <hi>ſchiſme</hi> or <hi>ſeparation,</hi> but where a preceding union hath
prepared it. Well may it be a crime or fault of another nature or
kind in Congregationall Churches, to limit themſelves in point of
appeale, unto Churches onely of their own conſtitution; but for
the crimes of <hi>ſchiſme and ſeparation</hi> here charged upon it, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably
innocent. And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Prynnes</hi> Printer (I preſume rather
caſually, then conſultedly) by making it, not an <hi>apparant,</hi> but an
<hi>apparent</hi> Schiſme, hath much eaſed the burthen of the charge; and
repreſents the action more like unto it ſelfe in point of truth, then
the Author himſelf intended; for the truth is, there is no realitie or
truth, but onely an appearance or ſhew (at moſt) of a <hi>ſchiſme</hi> or
<hi>ſeparation</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>2. It is but a <hi>miſtaken</hi> ſuppoſition in him, to ſuppoſe, that in caſe
an aggrieved partie in an <hi>Independent Church,</hi> ſhall chuſe rather to
appeale to a Church (one, or more) of a differing Government
and conſtitution from their own, that this Church will refuſe to
be accountable unto the Church or Churches ſo appealed unto,
becauſe they are not of the ſame conſtitution with it ſelf. I beleeve
there is no Congregationall Church any where, but if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and in a Chriſtian manner required or called upon to do it,
will be ready and willing to render an account of any of her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or proceedings, not onely to a <hi>Presbyterian Church,</hi> but even to
the meaneſt member of it. But</p>
            <p>3. Why he ſhould call a voluntary <hi>account</hi> given by a Church,
<hi>a meere mockery in ſtead of an account,</hi> unleſſe the Church accounted
unto, ſhould have power <hi>to inforce it to correct its errors or injuſtice,</hi>
my eyes can ſee no reaſon. For in caſe the Church which willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accounteth for her actions unto another, ſhall, upon the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and ſight of any <hi>error</hi> or <hi>injuſtice</hi> in theſe her actions, as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
retract and reforme them (which, with the help and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of a very little charitie, may ordinarily, if not univerſally,
be preſum'd of Saints) why ſhall not ſuch a reformation as this,
being voluntary and free, be every whit as commendable and reall,
as a reformation compelled or inforced would be? And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
why ſhould not an <hi>arbitrary</hi> or voluntary <hi>account,</hi> be as
Chriſtian, as ſatisfactory, as reall, as that which is purchaſed by
an iron rod? Or doth any Church or aſſociation of Churches,
obtaine a quicker or richer ſpirit of diſcerning, or a more accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:124227:19"/>
facultie of convincing Churches that are delinquent, of
their <hi>errors</hi> or <hi>injuſtice,</hi> by being armed with a compulſive power
over them, then they were or would be capable of, if their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
were conſultative and perſwaſive onely? Or hath a Church
called to an account for <hi>error</hi> or <hi>injuſtice,</hi> any more reaſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
either for ſuch, becauſe they are adjudged ſuch unto
her, by Churches (one or more) having a coactive power over
her, then if this ſentence were paſſed by Churches not daring to
claime, owne, or exerciſe any ſuch power?</p>
            <p>4. And laſtly, I would faine know, why it ſhould be more
<hi>ſchiſme</hi> or <hi>ſeparation,</hi> for an <hi>Independent Church to appeale onely unto
Churches of their owne partie,</hi> and not unto the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> then it
is for <hi>Presbyterian Churches,</hi> to appeale onely to Churches of their
partie, and not unto the <hi>Independent;</hi> conſidering, that Churches
of this conſtitution, are every whit as much (at leaſt) Churches
of Chriſt, as thoſe of the other. But the truth is, it being lawfull
and free (as himſelf here ſuppoſeth) for Churches to appeale to
Churches, as well of the one conſtitution, as of the other, that it
is ſomewhat an uncouth and ſtrange conceit, to make <hi>ſchiſme</hi> or
<hi>ſeparation</hi> of appealing either unto the one, or the other.</p>
            <p>Whereas (<hi>p.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 29.</note> 17.) he gives us leave <hi>to differ in judgement from the
decrees of Synods and Parliaments, when erroneous and contrariant to
the expreſſe Word, not to our owne fancies, inferences, or opinions;</hi>
doubtleſſe, he <hi>miſtakes,</hi> taking that away from us with the one
hand, which he gives us with the other; which, I preſume was
not his intention. For if we <hi>may</hi> not <hi>differ in judgement</hi> from Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall
decrees, <hi>when they are contrariant to our opinions,</hi> wee may
not ſo <hi>differ</hi> from them at any time. Or <hi>may we,</hi> or can we <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in judgement</hi> from that, which is not <hi>contrary to our opinion?</hi>
Though M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Prynne differs in judgement</hi> from thoſe that hold forth
the <hi>Congregationall way,</hi> yet (it ſeems) he may be of the ſame <hi>opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
with them concerning that way.</p>
            <p>Whereas (in the ſame page) he demands of us,<note place="margin">Sect. 30.</note> 
               <hi>If we deem not
our ſelves more holy then our brethren, or be not ſweld up with ſpirituall
pride, why refuſe we to cloſe with them now, as we have done heretofore?</hi>
The ground of the demand (queſtionleſſe) is a <hi>miſtake,</hi> and ſhould
not ſuffer <hi>ultrâ condignum,</hi> if it were called an <hi>error.</hi> There may be
many reaſons why one man <hi>cloſeth</hi> not with another in point of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:124227:19"/>
               <hi>judgement</hi> (and conſequently why not in practice alſo?) beſides <hi>dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
himſelfe more holy then his brother,</hi> from whom hee diſſenteth,
or being <hi>ſweld up with ſpirituall pride.</hi> I doe not conceive that the
Apoſtle <hi>Paul deemed himſelfe more holy</hi> then <hi>Peter,</hi> much leſſe that
he was <hi>ſweld up with ſpirituall pride,</hi> when hee not onely diſſented
from him touching the juſtifiableneſſe of that courſe and practice
wherein <hi>Peter</hi> now walked, but (as the text ſaith<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 2. 11.</note>) withſtood
him to his face; but that the true ground of ſuch both diſſent and
reſiſtance, was partly the ſtanding of <hi>Pauls</hi> judgement in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto, and diſlike of what <hi>Peter</hi> did; partly the deſire hee had
of doing his fellow Apoſtle the Chriſtian kindneſſe of making
ſtreight that which was crooked in his way; partly alſo (if not
principally) his zeal and faithfulneſſe to his Lord and Maſter Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, and his Goſpel, and his Saints, that none of theſe might
ſuffer loſſe or diſadvantage in the world by the miſpriſions, or
miſcarriages of any man, how great or holy ſoever, as farre as lay
in his power to prevent it. Nor would it have been any diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or diſhonour at all to the name of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynne,</hi> nor wound
(I beleeve) to his conſcience, if hee had wav'd thoſe hard ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
we ſpake of, and ſubſtituted theſe or the like in their ſtead,
as the true grounds of his brethrens <hi>not cloſing</hi> with him, and thoſe
of his judgement in the Presbyterian way. The truth is, that for
my part (and I verily beleeve that I may truly ſpeak the ſame for
many thouſands more) any conceit or <hi>deeming of my ſelfe more holy
then others,</hi> was ſo far from intereſſing either my judgement or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
for the congregational way in the leaſt, or from keeping me
at any diſtance from my brethren of a contrary judgement, that a
ſenſe of mine owne defectiveneſſe therein, together with an earneſt
deſire of better accommodations for my ſupplies, was not the leaſt
of thoſe motives and arguments which carried and ſet my heart
upon that way. And here I make open profeſſion in the preſence
of Heaven and Earth, that if any of my brethren of oppoſite
judgement, ſhall give me any reaſonable account, or ſatisfaction,
how in an ordinary way of providence, or experience, I may build
up my ſelfe in holineſſe, better (or, if it be but as well) in the way
of Presbytery, then in that way wherein I am for the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
I will ſoon pull down what I have built, and dwell no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in the Tents of Independencie, but devote my ſelfe, and all my
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:124227:20"/>
ſtrength and might, to the ſervice of that way, which for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ſake is called Presbyterie. For I make no queſtion, but
that way of Church-government which hath the richeſt ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
and moſt direct and full compliance with the edification of
the Saints in holineſſe, is againſt all reaſons, grounds, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of what ſeeming ſtrength or evidence ſoever, the way which
Jeſus Chriſt hath ſealed.</p>
            <p>For any <hi>harſh cenſures</hi> caſt, or paſſed by any Congregationall
men upon Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> or other of their brethren of Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi>
judgement and way, I truſt the complaint is to the height of the
crime. I cannot juſtifie one <hi>harſh cenſure</hi> given, by a thouſand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
but if there were a Law for any ſuch attonement, I make no
queſtion but that all the Congregational delinquency in that kind,
would be fully purged. If my pen hath treſpaſſed in this kinde,
(whereof notwithſtanding I am no ways conſcious, though upon
ſome charge, I have made diligent enquirie after my own guilt) I

then certainly it is the greateſt imprudence, or improvidence under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
for any man, or rank of men whatſoever, to appeare, eſpecially in any
high-handed oppoſition, or conteſtation, againſt any way, &amp;c.</hi> In ſtead of

moſt unworthily and unchriſtianly ſubſtitutes theſe, <hi>to appeare, or
ſo much as to lift up an hand, or thought againſt any way, &amp;c.</hi> Which
falſification of my words is ſo much the more unſufferable becauſe
in the explanation of my doctrine, page 12. I expreſſe my ſelfe
thus: <hi>It is not every degree or kind of oppoſing a way, doctrine, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
of God, which either the Text, or the doctrine calleth a fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God, but onely ſuch an oppoſing which is peremptory, and carried
on with an high hand, ſo that thoſe inſtruments of God which hee hath
anointed to hold forth that way, doctrine, or deſigne of his in the world,
are not ſuffered to execute their commiſſion, but are countermanded ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the authority, or over-bearing ſtrength or power of men</hi> And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
after, for the further explanation of my intent in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
propoſed, I diſtinguiſh thus: <hi>It is one thing to oppoſe, or contend

it</hi> per modum judicis: The former I grant, <hi>may befall the beſt and

               <hi>Prynnes</hi> artifice in ſwelling my two lines (at moſt) of doctrine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his 14. or 15. of repreſentation, that ſo hee may have the
fairer mark, and bigger But to hit, I ſhall <hi>verbatim</hi> tranſcribe it, as
it is laid down about the middle of page 12. of the ſaid diſcourſe.
The content and words of it are onely theſe: <hi>That for any man to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:124227:21"/>
endevour or attempt the ſuppreſſion of any doctrine, practice or way, which
is from God, is to fight againſt God himſelfe.</hi> Which doctrine, eſpecially
ſo qualified and underſtood, as the ſubſequent explication ſtates the
ſenſe, purport, and meaning of it, I could not lightly expect ſhould
ever have been oppoſed, or conteſted againſt by any that were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to owne <hi>Abrahams</hi> relation of friendſhip unto God.<note place="margin">Jam. 2.</note> But with
what ſucceſſe Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> hath attempted to ſhake the foundations
of the truth of it, or whether indeed he hath attempted this at all,
and not rather (contrary to the Law of all regular diſputation)
fallen foule onely upon the concluſion it ſelfe, without giving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
anſwer at all unto the premiſes, ſhall bee preſently taken into
conſideration. In the mean time let mee adde this: That if the
groſſeſt and moſt abhorred Heretickes in the world, might have
but the ſame liberty to prove their hereticall opinions out of the
Scriptures, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> 
               <hi>Pryn</hi> taketh to repreſent the doctrine proſecuted
by me, and quarrelled againſt by him, out of my Sermons, they
might prove them, and that <gap reason="foreign">

what opinion is there, or lightly can be imagined, but that all the
words, wherin it is (or at leaſt very eaſily might be) conceived, may
be found ſome where or other ſcattered here and there ſeverally in
the Scripture, &amp; ſo be framed together into a ſentence? By the law
of ſuch a liberty as this, I might ſay, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynne,</hi> in his Full
Reply, holds, That <hi>wee muſt ſpeedily oppoſe, reſiſt, avoid, ſuppreſſe,</hi>

               <note n="c" place="margin">Page 9.</note>. For all theſe words and
clauſes are to be found in this diſcourſe of his, as the pages cited
in the margine doe direct: yea, and twenty moe as wild and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
opinions, and as farre from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prinnes</hi> judgement as
this, might by the liberty aforeſaid, be collected out of the ſame
piece.</p>
            <p>But let us come to conſider thoſe grounds and reaſons,<note place="margin">Sect. 34.</note> upon
which, in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynnes</hi> judgement, <hi>it may juſtly be queſtioned whether
the Doctrine</hi> expreſſed towards the beginning of the laſt Section
(<hi>which is the maine,</hi> indeed the onely <hi>Doctrine proſecuted</hi> in thoſe
two innocently-offending Sermons) <hi>be Orthodox or tolerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His firſt Reaſon is; <hi>becauſe it opens a wide gate to the reviving of all
the old, the ſpeading and propagating of all new Hereſies, Errors—without
the leaſt timely oppoſition or prevention, to the endangering of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:124227:21"/>
infinite ſoules, and diſturbance of the Churches, Kingdomes peace. For
there is no Heretique, Schiſmatique or Sectarie whatſoever, but pretends
his way, Doctrine, practiſe, opinions, to be the way of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Will
any reaſonable man conceive, that there is any reaſon at all in all
this, to queſtion the truth or ſoundneſſe of the prementioned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine?
<hi>For any man</hi> to forbeare <hi>the ſuppreſſion of any Doctrine or Way
which is</hi> (for any thing that is knowne to the contrary) <hi>from God,</hi>
and that <hi>leaſt he ſhould fight againſt God,</hi> is this, <hi>to open a wide gate
to all hereſies, errors, and ſchiſmes?</hi> Then by the rule of contraries,
the ſuppreſſion of all Doctrines and wayes, which for any thing
that is knowne to the contrary, are from God, muſt be the faſt-ſhutting
of the gate againſt all <hi>hereſies, errors, and ſchiſmes.</hi> This is
the heart &amp; ſoule of the firſt reaſon, which intereſſeth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynnes</hi>
judgement in queſtioning the <hi>Orthodoxiſme,</hi> yea, the <hi>tolerableneſſe</hi> of
the premiſed Doctrine. But by the way, if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynnes</hi> judgement
concerning the Doctrine, be, that <hi>it opens a wide gate to all hereſies,
errors, ſchiſmes, ſects whatſoever, both new and old, &amp;c.</hi> it is marvaile
it ſhould have no further operation upon him, then onely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
with him to <hi>queſtion whether it be Orthodox or tolerable:</hi> Such
an effect or conſequent of a Doctrine as this, is foundation large
enough to build a confident determination upon, that it is <hi>hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
and intolerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for the body of this Reaſon, wherein he informes us at
large (and that with truth enough) that</hi> Satan and his miniſters
alſo tranforme themſelves into Angels of light, <hi>that falſe Teachers</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
come to ſeduce men in ſheeps cloathing, that there is no Heretique,
Schiſmatique, or Sectary whatſoever, though never ſo pernicious, groſſe,
and deteſtable, but pretends his way, Doctrine, practiſe, to be the way
and truth of Chriſt; <hi>with many other good ſayings to like effect;
I cannot but marvaile, what a reaſonable man ſhould imagine to
be in all this, to make him queſtion the truth of this Doctrine,
that</hi> for any man to attempt the ſuppreſſion of any Doctrine, practiſe, or
way which is from God, is to fight againſt God. <hi>Becauſe</hi> falſe Teachers
pretend their Doctrine to be from God, <hi>doth it therefore follow, that</hi>
the ſuppreſſing of ſuch a Doctrine which is from God, ſhould not be a
fighting againſt God? <hi>It is ſomewhat an hard caſe, that a man
ſhould be arreſted of a</hi> preſumptuous undermining the undoubted pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of Parliament by the very roots, <hi>at the ſuite of ſuch a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
as this.</hi>

Whereas upon the former aſſertions, he enters his action in
ſuch an Interrogatory as this: <hi>Muſt we therefore not ſpeedily oppoſe,
reſiſt, avoyd, ſuppreſſe them now, becauſe they thus pretend they are of,
and from God, but ſtay till God hath renounced them, &amp;c.</hi> I joyne iſſue
with him, and ſay; that there is little leſſe then a meere Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in the forme of his Plea; <hi>Thoſe Doctrines, practiſes, opinions,</hi>
which in the former part of his Plea, he had cenſured and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for <hi>Hereſies, Errors, Schiſmes, Sects, &amp;c.</hi> in this latter part
of it he ſuppoſeth, that <hi>God hath not yet diſclaimed, or renounced from
Heaven;</hi> and that we <hi>ſee not their condemnation yet written with the
beame of the Sun.</hi> Elſe why ſhould he repreſent it as ſo unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and hainous a thing, that we ſhould <hi>ſtay the oppoſing and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
of them,</hi> till ſuch things were done? Surely M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynne</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſo hardy, as to condemne any Doctrine or practiſe for
<hi>Hereticall</hi> or <hi>errneous,</hi> untill <hi>God</hi> hath ſome wayes or other <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
or renounced them from Heaven,</hi> for ſuch. It is he, not M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Prynne,</hi> that muſt, not onely <hi>determine,</hi> what is <hi>Hereſie, Error, and
Schiſme,</hi> but alſo ſignifie his determinations in this kinde, before it
comes to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynnes</hi> turne, or any mans beſide, to give any ſuch
ſentence againſt them at the barre of their Judgements.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Reaſon which created that jealouſie in him we ſpake
of,<note place="margin">Sect. 35.</note> againſt the forenamed Doctrine, is <hi>the contrarietie of it to forty
and one expreſſe precepts and preſidents</hi> (if my Arithmetique failes me
not in the computation) <hi>in the old and new Teſtament;</hi> one whereof
(<hi>viz.</hi> Jer. 4. 30, 31.) he avoucheth for <hi>pregnant;</hi> but the reſt (it
ſeems) muſt be <hi>compared together,</hi> or elſe the contrarietie in them
to the Doctrine which he oppoſeth, will not utter it ſelf. And it is
well that he can be content to afford us <hi>leaſure</hi> for the <hi>peruſall</hi> of
theſe Scripture precepts and preſidents, though he would afford
us none, to <hi>peruſe</hi> or conſider of <hi>Doctrines or practiſes,</hi> as we heard
before. But</p>
            <p>1. I muſt profeſſe the ſecond time, that I can little leſſe then
wonder, that the Gentleman ſhould onely <hi>queſtion</hi> or ſuſpect the
<hi>Orthodoxneſſe</hi> of a Doctrine, and not poſitively and peremptorily
conclude it <hi>Heterodox,</hi> which carrieth a <hi>contrarietie</hi> in it <hi>to forty-one
expreſſe precepts and preſidents of Scripture.</hi> A man would think by
ſuch a ſtreine of tenderneſſe and indulgence as this, that he were a
very faire and favourable interpreter of mens opinions and wayes;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:124227:22"/>
and would never exact or ſtand upon <hi>Summam jus</hi> (which the
Proverb interprets to be <hi>Summam injuriam</hi>) with any man.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>If all</hi> the precepts and preſidents <hi>here drawne together from
the Scriptures, be</hi> expreſſe, <hi>why is that one,</hi> Jer. 4. 30, 31. <hi>ſeparated
from all its fellows by this parentheſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s of preferment,</hi> [a pregnant
place] <hi>as if all the reſt were barren and empty of that conception,
which is indifferently fathered, or mothered rather, upon them all?
and one other of them</hi> (viz. <hi>Gal. 2. 4. to</hi> 18.) <hi>ſingularized with
this parentheſis,</hi> [a noted place]? <hi>If no</hi> contrarietie <hi>to the ſuſpected
Doctrine be found either in</hi> the pregnant place, <hi>or in</hi> the noted place,
<hi>I truſt all the reſt of the</hi> places <hi>will give</hi> place, <hi>and confeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſtrangers thereunto. Firſt, for the</hi> pregnant place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 30,

of gold, though thou renteſt thy face with paynting; in vaine ſhalt thou

his truſt, with emphaticall letters, thus;</hi> Paul would not give way to

his margent glorieth with quotations in abundance, here (it ſeems)
it is aſhamed, as not knowing what to ſay, nor where to finde or
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:124227:24"/>
point at, any <hi>pleading for Schiſmes and Conventicles,</hi> as the lines in

            <p>3. <hi>What Mr</hi>. Prynnes <hi>privie notion of a</hi> Schiſme or Conventicle <hi>is,
I am not able to ſay: but if hee be here of the ſame minde and
judgement with his own marginall note,</hi> p. 10. <hi>which affirmeth,
that</hi> none are Conventiclers but Heretiques and Schiſmatiques, who
wholly ſeparate themſelves from our publique aſſemblies eſtabliſhed by

            </p>
            <p>4. If by <hi>pleading for Schiſmes and Conventicles,</hi> he means a plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the ſpirituall liberties of the <hi>Congregations of the Saints,</hi> and

and immunity in their ſpirituall affaires, and ſuch as concern the
regulation of their conſciences in matters appertaining to the
worſhip and ſervice of God, from the Juriſdiction and intereſt of
the Commiſſioners and Delegates of the world; if this (once
again) be <hi>pleading</hi> for <hi>Schiſmes and Conventicles,</hi> I had quitted my
ſelf much more like a faithfull Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, if I had
<hi>pleaded</hi> for them yet ſeven times more, then now I have done.

of government are ſuch tender things, that they cannot be tolerated in
one and the ſelf-ſame Church and State, without infinite inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
and diſtances, &amp;c. <hi>I anſwer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That <hi>differences and varieties in matters of Government,</hi> are
not things ſo <hi>tender</hi> in any degree, as the conſciences of the
Saints; and therefore no reaſon, that <hi>Reaſon of State</hi> ſhould be
more tenderly reſpected, then theſe. Better a thouſand men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenienced
in their temporalls, then one righteous ſoul woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in his ſpiritualls; yea, or then one ſin committed to prevent
all thoſe inconveniences. <hi>Vna Dei gloria</hi> (ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> a great
Presbyterian) <hi>praeferri meretur centum mundis.</hi> Yea, and one greater
then <hi>Calvin</hi> (I mean the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>) ſaith, (neither ſaith he any
thing more then what an whole Chriſtian State or Nation is
bound to ſay) <hi>If meat offendeth my brother, I will eat no fleſh whileſt
the world ſtandeth, that I may not offend my brother,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 13. But,</p>
            <p>2. Whereas wee ſtill heare of <hi>wars and rumors of wars</hi> from
Presbyteriall pens, of <hi>infinite inconveniences and diſturbances,</hi> and
turnings of all things upſide down in States, as if they ſhould
never die any other death, in caſe any other Government ſhould
be indured, but their own; the truth is, that ſuch predictions (or
pretences rather) as theſe, are but a kind of politique agents ſent
forth to negotiate their Cauſe with the ignorance and ſimplicity
of the generality of men; who being indifferent for matter of
Church-government, but of firmly-reſolv'd judgements to keep
themſelves as far from all that which is called trouble or diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
as poſſibly they can, are apt to drink in the impreſſions of
all overtures or pretences which ſound that way, <hi>as fiſhes drink
water,</hi> and ſo are made Proſelytes of a zealous inſpiration for the
Claſſique Conſiſtory. <hi>Primus in orbe Deos fecit timor.</hi> That mixture
of ignorance and feare which is commonly found in vulgar conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
may eaſily be wrought and faſhion'd by a politique hand,
almoſt into what apprehenſions, and indeavours ſuitable, a man
deſireth; if his deſign in this kind exceed not the compaſſe and
content of nature: for the darkneſſe of ignorance hath no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
at all with the kingdome of light; but being in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with an awakened paſſion of feare, it diſpoſeth the hearts and
ſouls of men to receive any ſuperſtitious impreſſions of what ſhape
and from ſoever the <hi>intellectus agens,</hi> or hee that worketh upon it,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:124227:25"/>
ſhal deſire. For my part, I am not able to calculate the leaſt rational
proportion or conexion between a variety or diffrence of Church-government,
&amp; the diſtractions, or diſturbances in a State; nor can I
eaſily beleeve, that all the Presbyterian Writers themſelves, do truly
&amp; unfainedly fear any ſuch effect from ſuch a cauſe, though ſome
peradventure may. For what if every congregation or Pariſh in &amp;
about <hi>London,</hi> had a different government, or way of ordering
their Church-affairs, as they generally have ſomewhat (more or
leſſe) differing in the ordering and managing of their Veſtries, or
Parochiall civill affaires, the one being ſuppoſed as agreeable to
the civill Lawes of the State, as the other, and each Pariſh reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
ſatisfied, and well apaid with their own government, I am
not able to diſcerne, nor caſt it in my thoughts, how the peace or
ſafety of the civill State ſhould ſuffer in the leaſt by it. But I can
very eaſily conceive, how a State may be very probably diſturbed,
(and I can give inſtances of many that have been) by an univerſall
compulſion of all the ſubjects thereof, to one and the ſame Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yea, and how by the like compulſion to one and the ſame
Church-government. It is very ſtrange to me that they that know
(and how generally it is knowne) what variety of Churches and
Church-government, yea, and profeſſions of Religion there are,
and have for a long time been in the dominion of the States of
<hi>Holland,</hi> and withall, how pacate, flouriſhing, and free from <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance</hi>
this State hath been; and againe, how that not onely a
forme of Church-government differing from that kinde of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
which is more generally practiſed throughout the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>France,</hi> but even a different Religion alſo, have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt occaſion of inconvenience or diſturbance to the
State, (yea I might ſay, to the great advantage and benefite of the
State,) been tolerated, yea little leſſe then countenanced, and that
neer the very heart, &amp; chiefe places of this Kingdom; very ſtrange
(<hi>I</hi> ſay) to me it is, that they that cannot lightly but know theſe
things (beſides many other inſtances in other States and Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
of like conſideration) ſhould yet pretend fears, yea certainties
of I know not what <hi>inconveniences and diſturbances to the State,</hi> if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more Church-governments then one ſhould take place, or bee
endured in it. They that ſhall pleaſe to peruſe page 23. of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of the two brethren to <hi>A. S.</hi> ſhall finde many Scriptures, of a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:124227:25"/>
friendly and harmleſſe conſiſtence of ſeverall Religions (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doubtleſſe of ſeverall Church-governments) in the ſame State,
beſides ſome others. And <hi>Lucas Oſiander</hi> in his Epitome of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
Hiſtory, written by the <hi>Magdeburgenſes,</hi> in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

relates ſeverall examples of ſucceſsfull iſſues and events of
ſuch mutuall tolerations, as wee now ſpeak of. Troubles and
diſturbances of States, are far more like to be the fruits and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
of rigour and hard meaſure, meaſured out unto the Saints,
then of favour or condeſcenſion unto them for their accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
They that think a State ſhould <hi>work wiſely</hi> for it ſelf, by
any hard intreaty of the ſervants of God, have forgotten where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>
               <hi>Whereas</hi> p.<note place="margin">Sect. 40.</note> 19. <hi>he taxeth me with a default, that</hi> I neither diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
unto him what that Way is, which I there ſo earneſtly plead for, nor
produce any one text to prove it Chriſts own way, nor one example to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
it, &amp;c. <hi>My Anſwer is,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. I ſuppoſe, that an underſtanding man, as all men acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynne</hi> to be, that proſecutes a Way with ſo much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and bitterneſſe, as hee doth the Way there pleaded for, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth
it all over, through and through, (and ſo needeth not
any further diſcovery of it to be made unto him). Such a man
(doubtleſſe) will take heed above all caution, of ſtumbling at that
ſtone above all other, whereat the <hi>Princes of this world</hi> ſtumbled,
and were broke to pieces, when <hi>they crucified the Lord of glory,</hi> before
they knew who he was, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
            <p>2. I anſwer further, that it was no part of my deſign or intent
in thoſe Sermons, to juſtifie the <hi>Way</hi> ſo oft there mentioned, ſimply,
or as a Way of Chriſt againſt all contradiction; but only to juſtifie
it againſt thoſe common exceptions and vulgar objections there
inſiſted upon; and to demonſtrate, that it may be <hi>Chriſts own Way,</hi>
notwithſtanding any thing that hath yet appeared to take away
that crowne from it: and ſo upon this conſideration, to perſwade
men, as they love and tender their own ſafety and peace, not to
lay violent hands upon it, untill they ſhould have better grounds
to judge it none of <hi>Chriſts Way,</hi> then yet they had any. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the adequate and preciſe tenor of my intention in that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
I kept my ſelf cloſe to it; and ſo had no occaſion to argue
any thing (or very little) in a cataskenaſtique or poſitive Way for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:124227:26"/>
But becauſe I produce nothing poſitively to prove the Way <hi>I
plead for,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 41.</note> (or rather, againſt the ſuppreſſion of it) to be <hi>Chriſts
own Way,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynne</hi> takes the courage to aſſault the credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of it by four Reaſons or Arguments, (as hee deſires to
have their number thought) though the ſecond and fourth be but
one and the ſame; and the third, nothing but what hee had ſaid
before, and that unſuceeſſefully, (as was argued in the 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Section</hi>
of this Diſcourſe) and the firſt, ſecond, third and fourth, nothing
to prophane the excellency, or pollute the beauty of that Cauſe,
againſt which his pen is armed. But let us anſwer them, ſo far as
they have not been anſwered already; only this one thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerv'd,
that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynn's</hi> conſcience, with the aſſiſtance of all his
four Arguments, doth not yet ſerve him, peremptorily or ſimply
to condemn this <hi>Way,</hi> as none of <hi>Chriſts own Way,</hi> but only <hi>to
ſuſpect it none of his,</hi> as himſelf expreſſeth himſelf in the laſt line of
<hi>pag.</hi> 19. Now being advanced no further in the confidence of his
judgement againſt this <hi>Way,</hi> but only <hi>to ſuſpect it</hi> for none of
Chriſts, I truſt, that remembring what <hi>Cameron</hi> (a learned Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian)
ſaith, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>ſuſpicion of falſity, was ever a calamity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to truth,</hi> he will advance no further in his oppoſition to it,
untill his <hi>ſuſpicion</hi> be grown up to the ſtature of a perfect, cleere,
and certain <hi>knowledge.</hi> This only premiſed, let us try whether the
grounds of his jealouſie it ſelf will not ſhake.</p>
            <p>To the firſt wee anſwer,<note place="margin">Sect. 42.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. That whereas this <hi>Way</hi> is here charged to <hi>be a new Way, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet heard of, in any age or Church of Chriſt;</hi> it hath been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
proved by thoſe that have written in the defence of it; that
in point of Antiquity, it hath the preheminence of its Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe
to the value of 1500 yeers, as having been that <hi>Way</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
wherein the Primitive Churches of Chriſt, through his
gracious &amp; wiſe indulgence adminiſtred unto them by his Apoſtles
in this behalf rejoyced for the ſpace of about 200. yeers, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:124227:26"/>
2. Whereas the <hi>oppoſition of the generality of Magiſtrates, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and people</hi> to this Way, is pleaded in barre to the legitimacy
and truth of it; We anſwer,</p>
            <p>1. That according to the tenor of Poeticall ſtory; <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
twenty yeers abſence from his houſe and home, was grown out
of the knowledge of his friends and neighbours; yea, <hi>Penelope</hi> her
ſelf (his wife) knew him not at his return at firſt, but upon ſome
conference and diſcoveries otherwiſe, hee became known both to
the one and the other. Nor ſhould it ſeem ſtrange to any, that a
Church-government, ſet up by the Apoſtles, ſo many hundreth
yeers ſince, and having for a thouſand yeers and upwards been
in exile, the rights, priviledges and poſſeſſions of it ſeiſed upon,
and uſurped by others, ſhould not preſently at the firſt return of it,
be acknowledged by the generality of men, no, nor by the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of her friends themſelves, I mean, godly, ſober, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
men; whom I call her friends, becauſe I make no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but there lies love and friendſhip to her, at the root and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of their hearts, though there be a cruſt of enmity and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
at the top, for a ſeaſon. <hi>Joſeph</hi> will in due time, make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
known unto his brethren.</p>
            <p>2. Though numbers of thoſe that are oppoſite to this <hi>Way,</hi> if
we compute the generality of them, be <hi>confeſſedly</hi> far greater, then
of thoſe that plead for her; yet the <hi>barren</hi> begins to rejoyce, and <hi>to
beare children apace;</hi> and the <hi>deſolate</hi> may in time come <hi>to have more
children then ſhe that hath an husband. John Baptiſt</hi> had many moe
Diſciples and followers at firſt, then Chriſt himſelf; yet ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſubſcribed to the dignity of Chriſt above himſelf, ſaying, <hi>He
muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe,</hi> Joh. 3. 30.</p>
            <p>3. The judgements both of Magiſtrates and common people,
concerning this Way, depending chiefly (if not ſolely) upon the
judgements of Miniſters, it is the leſſe ſtrange, that there ſhould be
found ſuch a grand concurrence in the judgements of both againſt
it, eſpecially for a time. There are theſe twelve Reaſons (among
others) why the judgements of Miniſters eſpecially may, according
to the courſe of humane affairs in other like caſes, ſtand off at ſome
diſtance form this Goverment, for a ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, their judgements have for a long time converſed familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with another, and that with approbation and contentment; by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:124227:27"/>
means whereof there is a kinde of a pleaſing ſympathy or conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalneſſe
growne between them; which is ſuch a conveniencie or
accommodation, that nature will not ſuddenly quit or loſe, nor
without good conſideration: <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>that hath
drunk old wine, ſtreight way deſireth new; for he ſaith, the old is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
Luke 5. 39.</p>
            <p>Secondly, godly Miniſters (more generally) ſtand publiquely
declared in their judgements for another Government. And how
hard a thing is it, even for good men (in the Philoſophers phraſe)
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to do execution upon their own tenets and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
eſpecially when they have own'd them in the ſight of the
world? The caſting out of his ſon <hi>Iſmael,</hi> is ſaid to have been a
thing <hi>very grievous in Abrahams ſight,</hi> notwithſtanding he had the
advantage of the expreſſe Commandement of God upon him, to
make it eaſie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 11. It is confeſſed, that this, (haply with
ſome others of the Reaſons following) beares as hard againſt ſome
Independents in their adheſion unto, and ſtiff-ſtanding by their
Way, as it doth againſt Presbyterians in their reſolvedneſſe for
theirs. But this rather confirms, then any way infeebles, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative
authority of it for that probation, which it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, many Miniſters conceive, that if they ſhall pull out
but one ſtone out of their building, though never ſo ill laid, they
ſhall ſhake the foundations of the whole fabrique, and that in caſe
themſelves ſhould begin with any one of thoſe Doctrines w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they
have taught, to diſclaim it, the people will follow their example
herein, and do the like by all the reſt. Whereas on the contrary,
the truth is, that <hi>to ſeparate the vile from the precious,</hi> is to raiſe the
honour and eſteem of that which is <hi>precious;</hi> and the cancelling of
ſome things, which a man hath taught, as erroneous, is an high
confirmation of all the reſt; according to that Schoole maxime,
<hi>Exceptio firmat regulam in non exceptis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, many by being declaredly ingag'd for ſuch or ſuch an
opinion, have fared the better for it, either in their credits and
reputations, or otherwiſe; yea, and haply at unawares, have gained
deep intereſt and honour with perſons of name and prime reſpects
in the world, by means of a co-ingagement in the ſame opinion
with them. Now as our Saviour ſaith,<note n="a" place="margin">Mar. 9. 39.</note> 
               <hi>there is no man that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:124227:27"/>
ſhall doe a miracle in my name, that can lightly ſpeake evill of me;</hi> No
more will men eaſily be brought to make refuſe or untruth of any
ſuch opinion, which hath been, and ſtill continues, ſuch a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factreſſe
unto them. Miniſters may truly ſay in ſuch caſes, <hi>Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium
accepi, libertatem vendidi:</hi> i. by receiving a benefit, I have ſold my
liberty.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, many are <hi>not able to be baptized with the baptiſme where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Paul was baptized,</hi> Act. 17. 18. where he was charged to bee
<hi>a ſetter forth of new Gods:</hi> they are not able to beare the reproach
of being teachers of new doctrines; of being charged with whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies
and <hi>Independent Crotchets</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Prynne.</hi> full Replies. p 74.</note>, of trading in <hi>Apes avd Peacocks</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">M. <hi>Edwards Antapol.</hi> p. 261.</note>, &amp;c.
and ſo reſolve to hold on in ſuch a way, wherein though they may
meet with ſome reproofes, yet they are ſure of farre <hi>more with them,</hi>
then they can feare being <hi>againſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, ſome think it a point of humility to build upon <hi>other
mens foundations,</hi> and feare they ſhould pollute the memories and
honour of <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> and other famous lights in the Church of
God, if they ſhould recede from their principles in the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, ſome have <hi>laeſum principium,</hi> a maimed principle of
ſeeing any thing that is new, except they ſee it firſt, cannot ſtoop
ſo low, as to carry any mans honor after him, (eſpecially that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeth
upon the earth with him: <hi>Paſcitur in vivis livor:</hi>) nor yet
ſo farre diſparage their own parts and abilities, as to judge any
thing which is of a new diſcovery, to be Truth, except they bee
ſome wayes or other intereſſed in the diſcovery of it. <hi>Ingenio qui
vult cedere, rarus erit.</hi> There is a notion (unſound as it ſeemes to

            <p>Eighthly, ſome are of opinion, that matters of truth in point of
Church-government, are neither too great nor too good, to bee
ſacrificed upon the ſervice of peace; though <hi>Luthers</hi> ſaying was,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:124227:28"/>
that <hi>unus apex verbi, major eſt coelo &amp; terra:</hi> i. <hi>the leaſt tittle, or poynt
of the word of God, is greater then heaven, and earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ninthly, ſome are more addicted to <hi>Authors</hi> then <hi>Arguments,</hi>
for the furniſhing of their judgements, and regulating their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
in matters of Religion: and then it is no marvell if theſe
make <hi>Silver and Gold</hi> of the Presbyteriall, and <hi>Hey and Stubble</hi> of
the Congregationall way; though it bee true alſo on the other
hand, that in very many Authors, and thoſe of Claſſique authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
both ancient and modern, there are <hi>manifeſta rotae veſtigia cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendi,</hi>
manifeſt prints and footſteps of this way<note n="a" place="margin">See Sions prerogdtive, almoſt throughout.</note>.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, the Congregationall way puts Miniſters upon a more
immediate dependence upon God and his providence for matter
of maintenance and outward accommodation: and how few are
there but had rather ſee, then beleeve? have the knowne Lawes of
a State, then the unknowne purpoſes and decrees of heaven, the
vouchers of their livelihood and ſupports to ſuch a proportion or
degree?</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, (ſome it's like) are afraid leſt the wrath and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the generality of the people of the Land, ſhould evince the
error and untruth of the <hi>Congregationall way,</hi> by offering violence
to thoſe that ſhall hold it forth in practice; and ſo chuſe rather to
build upon the peoples generall acceptation of the Presbyterian
way (which they cannot much queſtion) as an unqueſtionable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of the truth and goodneſſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly (and laſtly) others (probably) are jealous, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee,
that they ſhall not be able to give that quarter of contentment
to many great perſons, and men in place of authority, in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall
way,</hi> which they know they may in the Presbyterian.
Yea, they cannot lightly but foreſee, that in the practice of the
<hi>Congregationall way,</hi> they ſhall (in all likelihood and without the

of many great ones, who under God have power to grind their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and break their bones. And who will be willing to ſtudy and
take pains, and be earneſt with God in prayer night and day, for
the conviction of ſuch a Truth, which being diſcovered, will either
expoſe a man to all that danger of hardſhip and miſery in the
world, which we ſpeak of, or elſe doe him a worſe diſpleaſure then
ſo, by tormenting his conſcience, in caſe he ſhall refuſe to be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed?</p>

Theſe with many other like reaſons there are, why Miniſters
(rather then others) may more generally incline to fall in rather
with the Presbyterian, then the Congregationall way (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
why Magiſtrates and people, who ſee much by their eyes,
ſhould fall in alſo) and yet ſuch a conſtellation no ſigne from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but onely from the earth, (the element made to be trampled
under foot) of the truth &amp; righteouſnes of that <hi>Way.</hi> But that I may
not be miſtaken, nor leave the leaſt touch or taſt of offence in the
mind of any man, by occaſion of the reaſons inſiſted upon, I ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
profeſſe, as in the preſence of God, that I intend no ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
upon any of my brethren in the Miniſtery, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
minded to me in point of Church-government, as ſuch in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them; nor to infinuate as if they, either <hi>diviſim</hi> or <hi>conjunctim,</hi>
were ſwayed in their judgements by any of the ſaid motives in the
preſent controverſie: but to demonſtrate againſt my Antagoniſt,
that ſuch tentations are very incident to the nature of man, yea,
even when it is under the beſt accompliſhments of nature, induſtry
&amp; grace it ſelf: and conſequently, that his argument drawne, <hi>A mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudine
taliter ſentientium,</hi> is of little force. I freely acknowledge,
that Miniſters very poſſibly may have (yea I verily beleeve that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have) the Presbyterian way in their hearts, who never conſulted
with any of thoſe Oracles about the bringing of it in thither: and
that many of this judgement are as candid, free, unſpotted, and
untouched by any of thoſe reſpects, in their way, as many who
imbrace the Congregationall way, are in theirs. Yet</p>
            <p>4. I muſt anſwer this one thing further to my <hi>Repliers</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the teſtimony of a few godly perſons, having little or
nothing of this world to accommodate their judgements, but a
thouſand things to diſtance and diſtaſte them, is in reaſonableneſſe
and fairneſſe of conſtruction, of more conſideration for the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a truth, then the judgement of many who have the Sunne,
Moone, and twelve Starres to give light unto them, I mean all or
moſt of this worlds endowments to confirme them.</p>
            <p>5. (And laſtly) the known caſe happening at the Councel of <hi>Nice</hi>
between <hi>Paphnutius</hi> and the reſt of the learned members thereof,
with that of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> oppoſing (in a manner) the whoſe
Chriſtian world now turned <hi>Arrian,</hi> with ſome others of like
conſideration that might be added, have broke the heart of that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:124227:29"/>
Topique place, <hi>Quod pluribus videtur, &amp;c.</hi> and made it void and
invalid for ever.</p>
            <p>To his ſecond Argument, which (it ſeemes) ſtrengthens the
hand of his great jealouſie againſt the Congregationall cauſe, I
anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I am unduly and untruly charged, to <hi>acknowledge the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall
government ſet up by a few private men, againſt the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and commands of the Parliament, &amp;c.</hi> I no where mention any
<hi>Authority or command of Parliament</hi> declared againſt this <hi>Way;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indeed doe I know any to this houre. Nor doe I either hope
or feare to live to that day, wherein private men may not both
feare God, and obey Jeſus Chriſt, without offending <hi>againſt the
authority and commands of Parliament.</hi> But this charge being hard
to find in my diſcourſe, and he that affirmes it, being deſirous to
make it as hard to anſwer or diſprove, he takes field-room enough
for his reference, and in his Margine bids us (in effect) looke from
page 30. to 52. telling us, that if we look narrowly enough, wee
ſhall find it ſomewhere within that circuit, though himſelfe (it
ſeems) knowes not well where.</p>
            <p>2. Nor do I any where, either <hi>tacitly</hi> or vocally <hi>acknowledge</hi> that
this way, <hi>not onely denies, but oppugnes the temporall Magiſtrates,
Parliaments, Synods directions or coercive power in Eccleſiaſticall affairs.</hi>
If any man of this way doth <hi>denie,</hi> much more if hee <hi>oppugneth</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the one or the other, it is not neceſſary that he ſhould doe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as a Son of this <hi>Way,</hi> nor by any influence of thoſe grounds
and principles upon which this <hi>Way</hi> is built. But I verily beleeve,
that Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> never knew any man of this <hi>Way,</hi> that ever <hi>denied,</hi>
much leſſe <hi>oppugned</hi> any <hi>directions</hi> whether from <hi>Parliaments</hi> or
<hi>Synods,</hi> (or from farre meaner hands then either of theſe) unleſſe
they ſaw or apprehended them contrary to the mind and will of
God in the Scriptures; in which caſe I have that Chriſtian and
honourable opinion of the authour of this charge, that he would
<hi>deny</hi> them himſelfe. What he meanes by the word <hi>oppugning,</hi> in
ſuch an emphaticall oppoſition to a <hi>denying,</hi> is none of my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
It he meanes onely a pleading or an arguing <hi>in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
I conceive it no wayes oppoſite unto, but of a juſt and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
concurrence with a <hi>deniall.</hi> For he that <hi>denies</hi> any thing affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by another, is bound to, (or at leaſt very lawfully may) give a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:124227:29"/>
reaſon of that his deniall; which muſt needs be an <hi>oppugning</hi> (in
this ſenſe) of the others aſſertion. If by <hi>oppugning,</hi> he means, an
oppoſing or reſiſting by force, the charge is a moſt unworthy and
unchriſtian ſlander. I no where give the leaſt intimation that the
<hi>way</hi> I plead for in any of her principles or maximes, thus <hi>oppugneth</hi>
either <hi>Parliaments</hi> or <hi>Synods,</hi> either in their <hi>directions,</hi> or in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of any <hi>coercive power.</hi> As for a <hi>coercive power in Synods,</hi> I think
Mr. <hi>Prynnes way denies, if not oppugns,</hi> it, as well as mine. And to
gratifie the Civill Magiſtrate with ſuch a <hi>power</hi> as this, in matters
of Religion, denying him withall any <hi>Directive power</hi> for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
and government of it (which is the bountie of the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
way</hi> to the Civill Magiſtrate<note n="a" place="margin">The Civill Magiſtrate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates not to himſelf any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective power in matters of Religion. <hi>A. S.</hi> in his Obſerv. &amp; Annot. <hi>p.</hi> 5. And againe, <hi>p.</hi> 7. To grant them ſuch a power (<hi>viz.</hi> of judging que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate between the two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) were nothing elſe but to joyne your ſelves with the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,</hi> &amp;c.</note>) is no ſuch eminency of deſert
at his hand, above what the <hi>Congregationall way</hi> doth willingly and
chearfully leave unto him. The underſtanding and reaſon of a
man, is certainly better then the ſtrength of an Elephant, or a
Lyon.</p>
            <p>3. I abſolutely deny, that Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> hath either <hi>largely,</hi> or
contractedly <hi>proved,</hi> either by <hi>many Texts,</hi> or any Texts, either in
his <hi>Independencie examined,</hi> or in any other of his writings whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
whether <hi>examined</hi> or unexamined the deniall of any ſuch <hi>coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
power,</hi> either in <hi>Parliaments or Synods,</hi> to be either <hi>directly</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly
contrary to the Scriptures,</hi> which either the <hi>Congregationall
way,</hi> or any Patron or friend of this way, that I know of, have <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,</hi>
or doe <hi>deny</hi> unto either. And whereas his page boaſts of his
<hi>large proofe hereof by many Texts,</hi> and by this finger (o) points us to
his margent, as if that would juſtifie and make good this boaſting;
the honeſt margent, as conſcious to the vanitie thereof, refuſeth to
ſay any thing at all, jot or tittle, to it.</p>
            <p>4. Whereas he pleads, that <hi>Paul himſelf even in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
pleaded his cauſe before Feſtus, Felix, and King Agrippa,</hi> all this
is granted in point of <hi>Truth,</hi> but abſolutely denied in point of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie</hi>
to his purpoſe. If <hi>Independents be brought before Kings and
Rulers for Chriſts ſake,</hi> or for their conſcience ſake, it is their wiſeſt
courſe (and that which well becomes them, yea, and that which
they would doe, if ſo brought) to <hi>plead their cauſe before them</hi> as well
as they can, as <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>before Feſtus, &amp;c.</hi> But though <hi>Paul</hi> was a
<hi>choſen veſſell</hi> of Chriſt <hi>to carry his Name before Kings</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 9. 15.</note>, yet they were
choſen veſſels of Satan, who compell'd or brought him before
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:124227:30"/>
Kings to anſwer for his life, becauſe he preach'd and practis'd the
doctrine of Chriſt, notwithſtanding he alwayes carried the Name
of Chriſt with him, whenſoever he was brought before them.
Nor doth his <hi>pleading his cauſe before Feſtus, &amp;c.</hi> any whit more
prove that <hi>Feſtus</hi> had <hi>a lawfull coercive power</hi> in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then <hi>James</hi> his being ſlaine by <hi>Herods ſword,</hi> or Chriſts being
crucified by <hi>Pilates</hi> power, prove that Civill Magiſtrates have a
lawfull power to ſentence the faithfulleſt and moſt innocent men
unto death. As for <hi>Pauls appeale unto Caeſar,</hi> (an Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour)
can we blame him for it, when as he hop'd to find more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
and faire proceedings before him, then at the Judicatories of
inferior Judges? If Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> will accept or interpret, either the
<hi>pleading of our cauſe before</hi> a Civill Magiſtracy when we are brought
before it, or an appealing from an inferior Civill Judicatory when
we feele or feare injuſtice, to a Superior, or an acknowledgement
of a lawfull power in the Civill Magiſtrate to reſtraine the violence
and unjuſt proceedings and practiſes of men againſt us; if (I ſay)
he will interpret any, or all theſe, to be an acknowledgement of a
<hi>Coercive power in the Civill Magiſtrate, in Eccleſiaſticall affaires,</hi> there
is an end of this ſtrife between us; we will all readily ſubſcribe,
that ſuch a <hi>coercive power</hi> as this <hi>in matters of Religion and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
affaires,</hi> is the <hi>undoubted priviledge</hi> of the Civill Magiſtrate,
and of right belongs unto him.</p>
            <p>5. Wee freely likewiſe ſubſcribe unto thoſe injunctions of the
Apoſtle, where <hi>he injoyns all Chriſtians to pray, even for heathen Kings,
Magiſtrates, and to ſubmit to all their lawfull commands for conſcience
ſake:</hi> yea, and are heartily ſorry that any ſuch <hi>commands</hi> ſhould at
any time proceed from <hi>Kings, Magiſtrates,</hi> whether <hi>Heathen</hi> or
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> unto which we cannot <hi>ſubmit</hi> with a good conſcience,
and <hi>for conſcience ſake;</hi> but are neceſſitated even <hi>for conſcience ſake</hi> to
decline them. Onely we queſtion, whether <hi>Kings, Magiſtrates,
Heathen</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> have any power from God, to <hi>puniſh good and
godly men,</hi> for declining ſuch commands of theirs <hi>for conſcience ſake,</hi>
which they cannot <hi>for conſcience ſake</hi> ſubmit unto.</p>
            <p>6. For thoſe <hi>Princes and Magiſtrates who were long ſence predicted
to become nurſing Fathers to the Church under the Goſpel,</hi> we wiſh them
all Chriſtian care, tenderneſſe, and compaſſion, according to the
nature and tenor of this ſo honourable a ſervice and imployment,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:124227:30"/>
               <hi>ſo long ſence</hi> by prophecie from God aſſign'd and recommended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them. But whether it be proper for thoſe, that deſire to be
look'd upon as <hi>nurſing Fathers of the Church,</hi> to ſacrifice the peace
and comfort of one part of the children of the Church upon the
ſervice of the wills or humors of another part of them, I leave to
<hi>nurſing mothers,</hi> who have twins of their womb hanging upon their
breaſts, to judge and determine.</p>
            <p>7. And laſtly, for the <hi>good and wholeſome Laws enacted by Cyrus,
Artaxerxes, Darius, &amp;c. for the worſhip of God, &amp;c.</hi> We gave (I truſt)
<hi>a good and wholeſome anſwer</hi> in the former part of this diſcourſe,
publiſhed ſome weeks ſince. Wee freely grant a power, yea, and
more then a power, a neceſſitie by way of dutie, in <hi>Kings, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
to further the honour and ſervice of the true God, and his people in
the worſhip of him.</hi> It is onely a power of diſcouraging <hi>his people,</hi>
of interrupting and hindring their peace and comfort in the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and ſervice of the true God,</hi> which we conceive incompetible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Magiſtracie, as any gift or donation ſetled upon it by God.</p>
            <p>His third Argument or ground of jealouſie againſt the <hi>way</hi> of his
great Conteſtation,<note place="margin">Sect. 44.</note> is, that <hi>it appears to be a way that will breed infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
confuſions, diſorders, by confounding the bounds of Pariſhes, &amp;c.</hi>
We anſwer</p>
            <p>1. That Phyſicians ſeldome complain of ſickly times; nor Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of thoſe that bring grieſt to their mills. The old ſaying was,
<hi>De morbo gaudet medicus.</hi> It is ſtrange to me that Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> ſhould
thus prevaricate with his profeſſion. But it may be this argument
is figurative, and cat-antiphraſticall: And ſo, by <hi>confuſions, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
&amp;c.</hi> he means, peace, unitie and concord amongſt men,
whereby <hi>confuſions, diſorders,</hi> and conſequently ſuits at Law, will be
prevented and cut off. And the truth is that ſuch peace, unitie, and
concord amongſt men, whereby ſuch unchriſtian miſchiefes and
miſeries as theſe, may in ordinary way of providence be prevented,
is the genuine and naturall product of this <hi>way,</hi> and a fruit that is
daily gathered from it by many.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas he chargeth this <hi>way,</hi> with <hi>confounding the bounds of
Pariſhes,</hi> and in his margent cites <hi>p.</hi> 38. to 40. of my two Sermons,
for the juſtification of this charge; the truth is, that both charge
and juſtification may go together, and ſerve in the Forlorne hope,
having neither reaſon nor truth to ſecond either. For 1. the <hi>way</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:124227:31"/>
he ſpeaks of, intermeddles not with, offers no violence <hi>to the bounds
of Pariſhes</hi> onely it thinks it equall that <hi>the bounds of Pariſhes</hi> ſhould
not offer violence, or be <hi>houſes of bondage</hi>  unto the conſciences of the
Saints, nor be as barres of iron againſt them in the way of their
comfort, and ſpirituall edification. 2. Whereas I am ſub-pena'd
for a witneſſe againſt this <hi>way,</hi> touching the crime objected, I meane
of treſpaſſing upon the <hi>bounds of Pariſhes.</hi> May anſwer is, that the
printed copie of thoſe Sermons of mine, which I have, hath <hi>ne gry
quidem,</hi> either in <hi>pag.</hi> 38, 39, or 40. of any ſuch matter: nor hath it
any where elſe, any page, paſſage, ſentence, line, word, ſyllable, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
point, or tittle, amounting to the import of ſuch a charge.</p>
            <p>3. Whereas his pen ſpits this black reproach in the face of <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencie,</hi>
that it is <hi>a Government inconſiſtent with Royaltie and the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Government;</hi> My anſwer is, that look in what degree this accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
and charge would be weighty and ſore, in caſe it could be
prov'd; in the ſame degree it is light and contemptible, through a
deficiencie of all, and all manner of proofe, or colour of proofe,
whatſoever. The Roman Empire loſt nothing of her beautie,
ſtrength, or intereſt, by the Churches of Chriſt practiſing this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in ſeverall places within the bounds and territories of it.
If it ſuſtained loſſe in any of theſe, by occaſion of this Government,
it was not becauſe of their toleration of, but their oppoſition
to it.</p>
            <p>4. Nor is this charge, that <hi>it giveth way to every ſect to chooſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
erect Churches of their owne without controule,</hi> of any better
commendation in point of truth, then the former. For it giveth
way to no <hi>ſect</hi> whatſoever <hi>without controule;</hi> it reproves, oppugns,
cenſures, and condemns ſects and ſectaries of all ſorts; ſo far is it
from granting allowance to them, to <hi>chooſe Miniſters, and erect
Churches, without controule.</hi> Indeed it knows no authoritie or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
which it hath from God, to countenance the <hi>controulement</hi>
of the civill ſword againſt ſuch perſons, who in the ſimplicitie (not
convicted obſtinacy) of their hearts, are miſled in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
it trembles to make miſpriſions in things of that difficult,
high, and rare attainment, as the acknowledgement of ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
truth is in matters of Religion, and the things of God, to be
matter either of confiſcation of goods, impriſonment, baniſhment,
death, unto men: though it denies not a power of reſtraint from
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:124227:31"/>
oppoſing the received faith, with publick diſturbance and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Whereas in Anſwer to ſomewhat argued by me to make the
innocency of</hi> Independencie <hi>touching matter of</hi> Diviſions, as cleare as
the noone day, <hi>he repones thus; That</hi> thoſe who in point of conſcience
cannot communicate or agree together in one Church, will never queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
accord well together in one familie, bed, Pariſh, Kingdome, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
manifeſts; <hi>I anſwer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That <hi>experience manifeſts</hi> the quite contrary. How many
Miniſters of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> judgement are there in the Kingdome,
yea, in and about the Citie, that hold communion in all deare and
Chriſtian reſpects, and terms of love and friendſhip, with many
called <hi>Independent,</hi> and theſe againe with them? The difference in
judgement between them in point of Church-Government, in
ſome rather increaſing, then diminiſhing or diſſolving their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie
and acquaintance. How oft doth Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> himſelf in
his <hi>Antapologie,</hi> acknowledge his Apologiſts to be dearly and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intereſſed in the love and care of many of his judgement<note n="a" place="margin">Many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned Miniſters—even ſuch as are their good friends, &amp; te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der enough of them, &amp;c <hi>p.</hi> 3. their friends &amp; familiars, <hi>p.</hi> 4. That all the godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Citie and Countrey ſhould carrie themſelvs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> love, reſpect, fairneſs, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindnes &amp;c. <hi>Et max:</hi> The Miniſters courted them by all waies of reſpect &amp; oft high enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of them inloving ſpeech, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, familiar co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ver ſing, &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 226</note>?
Yea, he commends his own love and affections towards them,
once and twice and the third time alſo<note n="b" place="margin">I love their perſons &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue them as Brethren, yea, ſome of them above Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that love I bear to them as Saints, I have a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall love, and a particular love of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to ſome of them, &amp;c. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> p. 7.</note>. How many families are
there in and about the Citie, wherein the reſpective members injoy
themſelves together with much Chriſtian ſweetneſſe and peace,
notwithſtanding relations to ſeverall Paſtors &amp; Churches among
them? I had it from a perſon worthy credit in a greater matter,
that a friend of his (a man alſo very well knowne to my ſelf, and
knowne for a man both of honeſty and underſtanding) related to
him; how that having but foure perſons in his familie, (himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of the foure) and every of theſe conſtantly repairing to a
different Congregation and Miniſtery, yet liv'd very peaceably,
comfortably, and contentedly together in the ſame houſe. Yea,
and that he moreover added; that except he ſhould grant this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
to the reſt reſpectively, he could not expect that good accord
and agreement with them and between them in his family, which
now he found.</p>
            <p>Yea, 2. <hi>Experience manifeſts</hi> yet more then this; <hi>viz.</hi> that not
onely perſons diſſenting in point of Church-Government, being
otherwiſe united in the profeſſion of the ſame pure, Orthodox and
undefiled Religion; but that perſons diſſenting in the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantialls

ſelf implies, that perſons, not onely diſtanced in their judgements
about Church-Government, but about the God-head of Chriſt,

at <hi>Gerar,</hi> Gen. 20. 1. with the <hi>AEgyptians,</hi> Gen. 12. 10. &amp;c. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
with Pagan Idolaters, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 27. but in the one and the
ſame <hi>familie,</hi> yea, and <hi>hed</hi> alſo, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 12, 13. 1. Pet.</hi> 3. 1. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4. And laſtly, Not onely <hi>experience,</hi> but even Reaſon it ſelf <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts,</hi>
that <hi>thoſe who cannot in point of conſcience communicate and agree
together in one Church, may yet very well accord together, in one fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
bed, Pariſh, Kingdome:</hi> yea, evident it is, that they, <hi>who cannot in
point of conſcience agree together in one Church,</hi> cannot poſſibly (or
lightly at leaſt) but <hi>agree together in familie, Pariſh, bed, Kingdome.</hi>
For if it be <hi>conſcience</hi> that ſets them at a diſtance in matter of
Church-government, it muſt needs unite them in the performance
of all ſuch duties, which are cleerly and manifeſtly ſuch. He that
out of <hi>conſcience</hi> abſtains from any practiſe, as not being ſatisfied in
his judgement touching the lawfulneſſe thereof; cannot but be
ready and willing to practiſe every ſuch dutie, of the neceſſitie
where of he ſtands convinced, either by the light of nature, or by
the Word of God; <hi>Conſcience</hi> being unpartiall between the negative
and the affirmative, and equally reſpecting its own comfort and
peace in both. Now it is no wayes probable, (if poſſible) that ſuch
as are truly <hi>conſcientious</hi> in point of Church-Government, ſhould
be ignorant of ſuch duties required of them by God in the foure
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:124227:33"/>
mentioned relations, <hi>family, pariſh, bed, kingdome,</hi> the practiſe and
performance whereof will ſtrongly and ſweetly unite and accord
them in the ſaid Relations, reſpectively. All theſe things conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I cannot wonder a little, that the Gentleman, who makes ſo
many <hi>Queſtions,</hi> ſhould make that <hi>Queſtionleſſe</hi> in the negative,
which is ſo palpably plain and <hi>queſtionleſſe</hi> in the affirmative. But</p>
            <p>6. Whereas I onely argue and demonſtrate, that the repairing
of perſons out of ſeverall Pariſhes to one and the ſame Miniſtery
or Paſtor, needs be no more trouble or diſturbance, then the like
repair of perſons of the reſpective Companies in London, to one
and the ſame Hall; he repreſents this demonſtration of mine, as if
I thereby intended to prove or juſtifie the Congregationall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
ſimply, and accordingly inſiſts upon 3 differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the one and the other. I know nothing but that he might
eaſily have found out not onely 3, but 23 differences, and have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
them all with as much pertinencie to his purpoſe, as he hath
done the three. For we do not urge the analogie of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Companies of Corporations in all the relations or appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances
belonging to it, as any ground or proof of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall
Government; we are better provided in this kind, then
ſo: we onely urge the particular mentioned, to accommodate and
heal the pretended offenſiveneſſe in the like, in this Government.
Notwithſtanding let us briefly ſee what advantage he hath gotten
againſt the Independent <hi>way,</hi> by his 3 <hi>great differences</hi> found <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
ſeverall Trades and Hals</hi> in one <hi>Citie, Pariſh, Kingdom, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
forms of Church-Government.</hi> As to the firſt we anſwer.</p>
            <p>1. That it is not ſo <hi>without diſpute,</hi> as he makes it, whether <hi>all
Trades, Societies, bold one another lawfull, uſefull, neceſſarie, agreeable
to the Laws of God, and the Realme.</hi> I know both ſome <hi>Trades,</hi> yea
and ſome <hi>Societies</hi> too in London, much queſtioned upon all, or
moſt of theſe particulars. But paſſe we this. Whereas he infers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, that <hi>ſo they breed no contrarietie of opinions or diſaffections, &amp;c.</hi>
We anſwer.</p>
            <p>2. That certainly <hi>experience</hi> doth not <hi>manifeſt</hi> this Contentions,
differences, <hi>diſaffections,</hi> yea and Law-ſuits ſometimes betweene
Trades and Trades, Societies and Societies, are known occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in and about the Citie. Whereas he addes: that <hi>each different
Church deems the other unlawfull, ſo as they cannot with ſafe conſcience
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:124227:34"/>
joyn or communicate together, and thereupon ſever one from another;</hi> We
anſwer.</p>
            <p>3. That according to Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> notion of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it is not neceſſarie that <hi>each different Church ſhould judge the
other unlawfull, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe he ſuppoſeth, that the Scripture is ſo
indulgent in this behalf, as to leave roome enough for variety of
forms of this Government. So that if he will but give others leave
to be of his judgement, this reaſoning of his fals to the ground.
But</p>
            <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) Though <hi>each different Church do deem the
other unlawfull, and ſo cannot with ſafe conſcience communicate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Church-ſhip;</hi> yet this hinders not, but that they may judge
and think as well one of anothers perſons (and conſequently love
and affect one another, and combine together as affectionately,)
as perſons of <hi>ſeverall Trades and Societies</hi> do; who have no more
communion together in their reſpective <hi>Trades,</hi> then different
Churches have in their reſpective <hi>Churches;</hi> yea, there is far better
ground (as hath been partly touched already) why different
Churches, though <hi>they deemeach other unlawfull,</hi> ſhould yet think
better of, yea and love the reſpective members each of other, then
there is, that perſons of <hi>ſeverall Trades,</hi> or members of <hi>ſeverall</hi> civill
<hi>Societies,</hi> ſhould do either the one or the other among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>To his ſecond difference,<note place="margin">Sect. 45.</note> I anſwer,</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>experience manifeſts</hi> the contrary to what he here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>ſubordination or ſubjection of ſeverall Trades, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
to the whole Corporation, Parliament, or ſupreame Magiſtrate,
doth</hi> not <hi>keep</hi> them <hi>all in peace and writie.</hi> What contentiones, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
emulations, ſuits amongſt them from day to day, any ſuch
ſubordination or ſubjection notwithſtanding?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Whereas by way of oppoſition he addes, that</hi> Independent
Churches will be regulated, obliged onely by their own peculiar edicts,
which muſt needs occaſion infinite ſchiſmes and diſorders; <hi>We anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. We wiſh that by way of commendation and praiſe in many
caſes, to <hi>Parliaments, temporall Magiſtrates, and Synods,</hi> which is
here caſt upon Independent Churches by way of imputation and
charge, I mean <hi>regulation and obligement by their own peculiar edicts.</hi>
But</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:124227:34"/>
2. Whereas the charge is thus laid againſt theſe Churches, that
<hi>they will be regulated, obliged onely by their own peculiar Edicts;</hi> the
truth is, that they are every whit as willing to be <hi>regulated, obliged,
by the Edicts</hi> of any other, as by <hi>their own,</hi> alwayes provided that
they be conform to the Word, and this conformitie ſufficiently
proved and made known unto them. They put no difference at all
between the mind of Chriſt preſented unto them by others or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
and found out by themſelves. Yea and that <hi>ſubordination
and ſubjection</hi> which they all profeſſe and own to the written word
of God, is a farre more effectuall and hopefull means, to <hi>keep them
all in peace and unitie,</hi> then that <hi>ſubordination</hi> mentioned by Mr.
<hi>Prynne,</hi> is to keep all <hi>Trades</hi> and Societies in the ſame precious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.
Onely in this one thing theſe poore Independent Churches
deſire <hi>Parliaments and Magiſtrates and Synods</hi> to <hi>be mercifull unto
them,</hi> that they cannot <hi>write</hi> any of them, infallible, nor yet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
unto any their injunctions or deciſions in matters of Faith,
or which concern the worſhip and ſervice of God, without retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scriptures for their Counſell, and adviſing with them what
to do therein.</p>
            <p>To his third and laſt difference alſo,<note place="margin">Sect. 46.</note> we anſwer.</p>
            <p>1. That he ſaith very well, in point of truth, when he ſaith,
that <hi>Chriſtians, as Chriſtians, are all of one and the ſelf ſame ſociety and
profeſſion, as thoſe of one trade and calling are.</hi> But this truth as yet,
is not at all conſcious to his intention or purpoſe. Therefore he
addes: <hi>therefore they ſhould all have but one Church and Government,
as theſe trades have.</hi> Nor doth this, if granted, make any whit more
for the Presbyterian cauſe, then for the Independent: becauſe it
doth not follow; <hi>Chriſtians, as Chriſtians, ought all to have one and
the ſame Church and Government:</hi> therefore this Church and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
ought to be Presbyterian. Take a parallel: <hi>Simeon</hi> and
<hi>Levi</hi> ought to have been Brethren: therefore they ought to have
been <hi>Brethren in iniquitie.</hi> Take another: <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi>
being man and wife, ought to have agreed together: therefore they
ought to have agreed together <hi>to tempt the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> But</p>
            <p>2. If by his <hi>one Church,</hi> he means, one and the ſame Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
myſticall, and inviſible Church; We anſwer, that <hi>Chriſtians,
as Chriſtians,</hi> have all <hi>one</hi> and the ſame <hi>Church;</hi> in this ſenſe, they
are all members of this <hi>one Church.</hi> But if he means, <hi>one and the ſame</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:124227:35"/>
miniſteriall and viſible <hi>Church,</hi> we anſwer, by demanding, How
can this thing be? We have heard indeed of ſome Oecumenicall
Councels; but of Oecumenicall viſible Churches, wherein <hi>all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
ſhould be comprehended as members, I beleeve there hath
been Oecumenicall ſilence unto this day.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Whereas he goeth about to</hi> ſet the compariſon (<hi>of his own
making</hi>) upright, by ſtating it thus: If ſome of one Fraternitie in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
(ſuppoſe Merchant-t tylors, Sadlers, &amp;c.) ſhould fall out among
themſelves, and one would have one form of Government, another ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and thereupon divide themſelves into ſeverall conventicles and pety
meetings in corners, not at their common Hall, and one chuſe one Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Maſter, another another, and ſo ſever the Company, and continue
Independent, this (no doubt) would prove an apparent ſchiſme and ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
of infinite diviſions, to the diſtraction, deſtruction of the whole
Company and Fraternitie; <hi>and then addes,</hi> This is the true State of
your Independencie: <hi>We anſwer, that</hi> the compariſon thus ſtated <hi>holds
no proportion or correſpondence with the</hi> State of Independencie.
<hi>For,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That number of Chriſtians which pleads for <hi>Independencie</hi>
(ſo called) is not the whole Socieitie of Chriſtians (nor indeed any
confiderable part thereof, in reſpect of number) as that <hi>Fraternitie
of Merchant-tayloes or Sadlers</hi> the compariſon ſpeaks of, is therein
ſuppoſed to be the whole Societie of ſuch a Company. Therefore
to ſet Mr. <hi>Prynnes compariſon upright,</hi> and make it agree with <hi>the
State of Independencie,</hi> in this particular, <hi>it muſt be ſtated thus;</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
two or three members of a numerous and vaſt companie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
(it may be) of ten or twenty thouſand perſons, ſhould differ
from the reſt of the Societie in ſome things about their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and hereupon ſhould withdraw themſelvs from that Society,
and ſeek incorporation elſewhere; would ſuch a diſſent or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
of ſo few from amongſt ſo many, any waies threaten the
<hi>diſtraction,</hi> much leſſe the <hi>deſtruction of the whole Company?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Suppoſe a conſiderable part of a Company, ſhould out of a
conſcientious diſlike of the carriage of things in the Government
of the body withdraw themſelves, and refuſe ſubjection to this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
ſo ordered and adminiſtred; though in probabilitie this
act of theirs may occaſion ſome <hi>diſtraction</hi> or diſturbance in the
reſt of the body for a ſeaſon; yet ſuppoſing it done upon ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:124227:35"/>
and due grounds, it may be ſo farre bringing <hi>deſtruction</hi>
to this body, that very poſſibly it may occaſion the Reformation
and amendment of thoſe things that were unjuſt in this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(and conſequently deſtructive to the bodie) and ſo become
a means of the preſervation of it from <hi>deſtruction. And this is the true
ſtate of our Independencie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. In caſe the <hi>Fraternity of Merchant-taylors in London ſhould fall
out amongſt themſelves, and one would have one form of Government,
and another another, and thereupon divide themſelves, &amp;c.</hi> What ever
inconvenience ſhould, or might hereupon enſue to the <hi>Company,</hi>
yet ſtill it was determined by equall and prudent Judges, who, or
which partie gave the chief occaſion of theſe diſtractions and
rents; there is no reaſon why any one partie ſhould fall foule upon
all the reſt, and give an extrajudiciall ſentence for themſelves. For
any thing that God hath yet determined to the contrary, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
partie of Chriſtians in the Kingdom, may be as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
(yea more innocent) of the breaches and diſtractions amongſt
us in point of Church Government, them the Presbyterian. They
that call and plead for that Government which is held forth in
the Scriptures, calling and pleading for it in a regular, meek and
Chriſtian manner, are thoſe that are innocent; and thoſe that call
and plead for any other, or indeed for any in a violent, prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and unchriſtian manner, (light the ſtroke where it will) are
thoſe that are guiltie. I confeſſe that in one reſpect, and that of
very great conſequence, I could really wiſh that the beam were
in the eye of Independencie, and the moat in the eye of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;
becauſe in this caſe it would (I conceive) be the ſooner and the
more eaſily plucked out. For as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid long ſince: <hi>Vitiun quod
inebriat multitudinem, examinis amittit veritatem.</hi> A ſin or error
that hath taken the heads and hearts of a multitude, is hardly
curable<note n="a" place="margin">Gravis enim eſt, &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculoſus error in plurimis: &amp; multorum lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, etiamſi ſe intelligat, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urgend pudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ſibi praeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, ex numero habens hoc im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudentiae, ut quod errat, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligentia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſſe veritatis aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, dùm minus error is eſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtimatur in multu.

of it, had need <hi>purifie</hi> himſelf, as men at Sea do, when they ſee
<hi>the breakings of Leviathan,</hi> and look for nothing but preſent
death. <hi>Job.</hi> 41. 25.</p>
            <p>4. In caſe any parcell or leſſe number of the <hi>Company of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-taylors
in London,</hi> could not with a good conſcience continue
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:124227:36"/>
their union and incorporation with the Societie, apprehending
ſome things ſinfull amongſt them, of the ſinfulneſſe whereof they
conceive an unavoidable neceſſitie that themſelves muſt be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
whileſt they continue their relation to the Company, the
reſt of the Company all this while reſenting no evill in the things
ſtumbled at by thoſe other, and ſo are able to keep on their way
without ſcruple; in this caſe it is ſo farre from being a thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to this <hi>Company,</hi> that the partie ſo ſcrupul'd, ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
that it is the beſt accommodation, thing ſtanding as they
do, whereof they are capable; it being certain that no Company
or Societie whatſoever but ſuffers loſſe and diſadvantage by union
and communion with ſuch members, who walk with gainſaying
judgements, and polluted conſciences with them. And this alſo
<hi>is the true State of Independencie.</hi> The Great Communitie and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
of Chriſtians in the Kingdom, ſuffer farre leſſe by the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents
withdrawing of themſelves from the Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
their judgements in this point ſtanding as they do, then
they would by their joyning with them therein. Their joyning
with them under the reclamation of their judgements and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaces,
would but diſaccommodate both parties; whereas their
refuſall in this kind, convenienceth both; and ſo hath the true
character of a legitimate contract or bargain between man and
man, which ſtill ought to be ſo conditioned, that both parties
may be bettered in their conditions by it. Therefore Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> hath
not <hi>ſet the compariſon upright</hi> to the point in hand.</p>
            <p>5. And laſtly, There is no arguing in Divinitie, either from
conveniences or inconveniences, from diſturbances or from peace,
from life or from death, againſt the neceſſitie of avoiding ſin, and
keeping a good and a cleere conſcience towards God. Therefore
ſuppoſing <hi>that the Company of Merchant-taylors in London,</hi> would by
ſuch fractions and diviſions amongſt the members thereof, as are
preſented in Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> compariſon, be in danger of ruine and
diſſolution; yet better were it that this ruine &amp; diſſolution ſhould
come upon it, then that God ſhould be diſhonoured by the leaſt
ſin, or the meaneſt ſoule indangered, for the preſevation of it<note n="a" place="margin">Cum tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis eſt medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, ſanari pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deat.</note>.
In like manner, it is more agreeable to the mind of God, and to all
principles of Chriſtianitie, that even the greateſt numbers and
multitudes of Chriſtians ſhould rather ſuffer, though very deep,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:124227:36"/>
in their externall conveniences, then that the leaſt ſin ſhould be
committed by the meaneſt of them, for their accommodation.
And this likewiſe is <hi>the true ſtate</hi> of things between <hi>our Independency,</hi>
and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynnes Presbyterie.</hi> Many other particulars there are,
wherein it might be made further to appeare, how ill his <hi>compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
comports with the caſe and <hi>ſtate of Independencie:</hi> but <hi>enough</hi>
(as the Proverb ſaith) <hi>is as good as a feaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To what he ſubjoyns concerning <hi>my preſent caſe in my own Pariſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 47.</note>
               <hi>miſerably divided, diſordered by my Independent way, &amp;c.</hi> I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
in part in my <hi>Innocencies Triumph.</hi> I here adde</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That</hi> my Pariſh <hi>is no otherwiſe</hi> divided, diſordered, by my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
way, <hi>then the world commonly is by the Goſpel, when
it cometh in power amongſt the inhabitants thereof.</hi> Think not
(<hi>ſaith our Saviour</hi>) that I am come to ſend peace on Earth: I came not
to ſend peace, but a ſword. For I am come to ſet a man at variance againſt
his Father, and the daughter againſt the another, and the daughter-in-law
againſt her mother-in-low: And a mans foes ſhall be they of his owne
houſhold, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 34, 35, 36.</p>
            <p>2. It was not <hi>my Independent way,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> affirmeth) but
the oppoſition to it, that cauſed thoſe <hi>diviſions, diſorders,</hi> (if any
ſuch be) <hi>in my Pariſh:</hi> If the partie which now oppoſeth, had been
willing, either to have complied with him whom they acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for their Paſtor, and the reſt of their Brethren, who ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themſelves unto him in this <hi>way;</hi> or elſe patiently to have wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon God, untill he ſhould pleaſe to reveale the goodneſſe of
the <hi>way</hi> unto them, in caſe they ſaw no ſufficient ground at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
for their ſubmiſſion in this kind (as many of the beſt of them
have done hitherto:) there had been no place for any <hi>diviſion or
diſorder</hi> amongſt them. And whether it be not more fitting, for a
people to follow their Paſtor, giving them ſubſtantiall grounds and
reaſons for that way wherein he deſires to lead them; then for a
Paſtor to follow his people in ſuch a way, whereof they neither
give, nor (I verily beleeve) can give, any account like men, I leave
to Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> and all unpartiall Judges, to determine.</p>
            <p>3. (And laſtly) Nothing is more regular, or of more conſtant
obſervation in all ages, then for troubles, commotions, and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances,
to attend for a while, any conſiderable mutation or change,

Yea, the truth is, that in all his contra-remonſtrance, he hath not
ſo much as once touch'd or mentioned that which is the maine
baſe or foundation of the principall concluſion managed in the
ſaid <hi>explanation,</hi> and principally oppoſed by him. The concluſion
is not that which Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> extracts from the paſſage which he
cites, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>there is not onely an improbabilitie, but an abſolute im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilitie,
that the Parliament ſhould have any power at all to enact
Lawes and Statutes in matters of Religion, Church-Government, &amp;c.</hi>
Here are words, which the <hi>explanation</hi> knows not, either in the
letter, or in the ſpirit of them, as by name theſe, <hi>not onely an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie,
an abſolute impoſſibilitie, no power at all, &amp;c.</hi> but the maine
<hi>concluſion</hi> driven at in the paſſage, is this; <hi>That the generalitie or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous
multitude of the Land, have no authoritie or power from Chriſt
to nominate or appoint, who ſhall be the men that ſhall order the affaires
of Chriſts Kingdome, or inſtitute the Government of his Churches.</hi> The
maine foundation or baſe of reaſon, upon which this pillar of
Truth ſtands in the ſaid paſſage, is this; Becauſe <hi>ſuch an Authoritie
or power (viz.</hi> to <hi>nominate</hi> or appoint who ſhall order the affaires
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:124227:39"/>
of Chriſts Kingdome, or inſtitute the Government of his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches)
<hi>is greater then ever Chriſt himſelf had,</hi> (I meane as man, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator)
<hi>at leaſt then ever he exerciſed,</hi> which in the ſequell I explaine
and prove. Now then this is that which I ſay, that Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> in
all his long reaſoning againſt the <hi>Concluſion,</hi> doth not ſo much as
with the leaſt of his fingers once touch this ground, or anſwer any
thing at all to it. So that he hath not as yet the leaſt colour or
pretence to blame me, if I be not proſelyted to his opinion by
what he hath written here. And becauſe I deſire faire and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
quarter with him for the future, I doe here promiſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
in the ſight of God, Angels, and men, that if Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> ſhall
at any time (God preſerving my life and underſtanding) plainly
and ſubſtantially demonſtrate and prove, either that <hi>the generalitie,
and promiſcuous multitude of the Land, have a power greater then ever
the Lord Chriſt himſelf had, or exerciſed as man, or Mediator;</hi> or, <hi>that a
power to nominate and appoint whom they pleaſe amongst men, to order
the affaires of Chriſts Kingdome, and inſtitute the Government of his
Churches, is not a power greater then ever Chriſt had, or at leaſt exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
as either man, or Mediator;</hi> I promiſe and proteſt againe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynne,</hi> or any other, ſhall at any time clearly and
fairly prove, either the one or the other of theſe propoſitions, I will
pull downe with both mine hands, what I have built up but with
one, and without any more adoe joyn judgement with Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>
touching the power of the Civill Magiſtrate <hi>in matters of Religion:</hi>
but till this be done, I neither ſee how Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> can with a good
conſcience perſiſt in his, nor require me to deſiſt from mine. It is
true, the Lord Chriſt as Mediator, had <hi>all power given him both in
Heaven and on Earth,</hi> Mat. 28. 18. That is, had the whole and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
execution and tranſaction of all his Fathers will, pleaſure, and
decrees, concerning all men, Angels &amp; creatures whatſoever, put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his hand &amp; power. <hi>And hath given him Authoritie TO EXECUTE
judgement alſo, becauſe he is the ſon of man,</hi> Joh. 5. 27. But he had no
power or Authoritie given him, to carry any thing contrary to his
Fathers will or pleaſure. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> (ſaith he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19.) <hi>the Son can doe nothing of himſelf,</hi> but <hi>what he ſeeth
the Father doe, &amp;c.</hi> So againe, <hi>ver. 30. I can doe nothing of my ſelf—</hi>
Now then as Chriſt had no commiſſion or power to give <hi>eternall
life,</hi> but onely to thoſe <hi>whom God</hi> the Father <hi>had given unto him,</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:124227:39"/>
Joh. 17. 2. Joh. 6. 37. So neither had he any Authoritative power
to inſtitute or appoint any other government for his Churches,
then that which he had <hi>ſeene with,</hi> or received from <hi>his Father:</hi>
much leſſe had he any ſuch power, to delegate unto men (leaſt of
all unto <hi>unſanctified perſons and rude multitudes</hi>) a power of nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
whom they ſhould pleaſe, to appoint and ſettle what go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
they pleas'd in the Churches of God. Certain I am, that
Chriſt never exerciſed any ſuch power as this: and therefore have
little hope of being convinc'd that he ever had it. Howſoever, let us
give the Gentleman an unpartial hearing in what he pleads againſt
the aforeſaid Concluſion.</p>
            <p>1. To his former marginall Annotation (<hi>p.</hi> 22.) honoured with
a Preface made of this word,<note place="margin">Sect. 49.</note> 
               <hi>Note,</hi> wherein he tells me that <hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel
and my Text never taught me any ſuch Anti-Parliamentary Doctrine.</hi>
I anſwer, that neither doth <hi>Gamaliel, nor my Text,</hi> nor any other
Text whatſoever in Scripture, teach Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> to call the truth <hi>an
Anti-Parliament try Doctrine.</hi> But both <hi>Gamaliel and my Text teach
me</hi> to take heed of <hi>fighting againſt God;</hi> and I being taught ſo high

ſuch a <hi>morſell</hi> alone, but to ſpread a Table for as many of my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren

            <p>2. To a ſecond Marginall note in the ſame page,<note place="margin">Sect. 50.</note> ordered like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to be <hi>noted</hi> (as the former) I anſwer likewiſe, that though
<hi>people have authoritie to nominate ſuch who by the rule of Gods Word may
limit ſome particulars, though not by their own bare Authoritie, without,
or againſt the Word,</hi> yet it followeth not; either</p>
            <p>1. That they <hi>have authoritie to nominate ſuch,</hi> who ſhall have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
by vertue of ſuch nomination to peremptorize by fire or
ſword all their <hi>limitations</hi> whatſoever, as agreeable <hi>to Gods Word.</hi>
Nor</p>
            <p>2. Doth it follow, that, in caſe their <hi>limitations</hi> ſhould be <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the word</hi> of God, therefore they have power to compell any
man by externall violence, to ſubject either in their judgement or
practiſe unto them; eſpecially whilſt they are not able to convince
them of any ſuch excellency in theſe <hi>limitations,</hi> as <hi>an agreeableneſſe
to the word of God?</hi> It is no waies <hi>agreeable to the word of God,</hi> that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:124227:40"/>
men ſhould be puniſh'd either in their bodies or eſtates, for not
ſiding with the truth <hi>in difficult and hard Queſtions;</hi> as all ſuch may
well be preſum'd to be, wherein <hi>ſober and conſcientious perſons</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſatisfied. The word of God doth not permit two perſons
or parties of a diſſenting judgement about an hard caſe or queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to judge or think hardly one of another<note n="a" place="margin">Rom 14. 2, 3, 4.</note>; much leſſe doth it
permit them to puniſh, or lay violent hands one upon another.
Nor</p>
            <p>3. And laſtly, doth it follow, that, though <hi>Princes, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
Miniſters, Parliaments, Synods,</hi> ſhould be nominated or <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by the</hi> lawfull <hi>power of the people,</hi> and withall ſhould <hi>have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
by the word of God</hi> to <hi>limit</hi> any <hi>particulars</hi> thereof; that
therefore this <hi>Authoritie</hi> ſhould be deriv'd upon them by means of
ſuch <hi>nomination.</hi> Every private man hath ſufficient <hi>Authoritie,</hi>
(though perhaps he may want abilitie of gifts) to <hi>limit any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

elſe but a true and right apprehending or underſtanding of

he hath no power by way of office to impart unto others, yet hath
he a right, yea, and an obligation upon him by way of dutie, ſo to
impart it, when God affords ſeaſon and opportunitie, time and
place for it. So that this marginall note is not acceſſory to any

            <p>3.<note place="margin">Sect. 51.</note> To a third marginall note ſubſervient in the ſame page to
the two former, I anſwer,</p>
            <p>1. That though it ſhould be granted, that <hi>every Magiſtrate, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and Synod have power to declare and injoyn, what is neceſſarie
to be beleeved, practiſed, by or according to Gods Word,</hi> yet this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

            <p>2. If by <hi>declaring and enjoyning,</hi> he means any ſuch <hi>declaring and

I anſwer, that this is but <hi>petitio Principii,</hi> a ſuppoſall of that
which is the main Queſtion; and therefore waits ſtill upon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

            <p>4. Whereas he puts himſelf to the needleſſe labour of repeating
the charge formerly charged upon my Doctrine, a <hi>an underminer
of the Authority of Parliaments,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall take admonition by it,
and ſave a <hi>needleſſe labour</hi> of repeating what hath been already ſaid
in way of anſwer to it. Onely I ſhall adde, that this Repetition of
Mr. <hi>Prinnes</hi> judgement and charge of my fore-mentioned Doctrine,
compared with my own thoughts and apprehenſions of it, puts me
in mind of a ſaying of a great Caſuiſt: <hi>Eadem poſſunt alicui videri
manifeſtè vera, quae alteri videntur manifeſtè falſa.</hi> The ſame things
may ſeem to one manifeſtly true, which to another ſeem as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly

the richeſt eſtabliſhment and confirmation to it: of which appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:124227:41"/>
Kings of the Iſraelites, who were choſen by the people, yet they made Laws
and Statutes concerning Religion, and Gods worſhip, with his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>I anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That the,<note place="margin">Sect. 52.</note> 
               <hi>Generall Aſſemblies, and Kings of Iſrael, were</hi> not
<hi>choſen by the people,</hi> at leaſt by any formall free choice of one out
of many, as our Parliaments and Aſſemblies are. For firſt the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Aſſemblies conſiſted of the generalitie of the people, and ſo
were not choſen at all; for where <hi>all</hi> are admitted, there is no
choice. Or ſecondly, if by the <hi>Generall Aſſemblies of Iſrael,</hi> he means
the ſeventy perſons ſpoken of, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 16. 24. &amp;c. it is evident
from the context, firſt, that they were not choſen by the people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that Aſſembly, but by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that by expreſſe order and
command from God. They might poſſibly be choſen by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
into the places of <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> over their reſpective
Families and Tribes; but they had no right or calling by vertue of
ſuch elderſhip, to gather themſelves into an Aſſembly of ſeventy,
upon any ſuch terms, or for any ſuch ends, as the fore-mentioned
Aſſembly were drawn together by God. Secondly, evident like-wiſe
it is, from ver. 25. that theſe ſeventy had a ſpeciall anointing
of the Holy Ghoſt from God, and prophecied. Therefore there
is a great difference between this Aſſembly, and generall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
now.</p>
            <p>2. Neither were the <hi>Kings of Iſrael choſen by the people,</hi> but by
God; except we will call a ſubſequent conſent and that by way
of duty and homage to the choice made by God, a <hi>choice. When
thou ſhalt come unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and
ſhalt poſſeſſe it and dwell therein, if thou ſay, I will ſet a King over me,
like as all the Nations that are about me, Then ſhalt thou make him King
over thee, whom the LORD THY GOD SHALL CHVSE, &amp;c.</hi>
Deut. 17. 14, 15. <hi>Saul</hi> their firſt King, was <hi>choſen</hi> and appointed
by God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 15, 16. So <hi>David</hi> their ſecond King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.

<hi>Solomon</hi> their King, is particularly ſaid to have been <hi>choſen</hi>
by God, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 1. So for the Kings that reigned over the ten
Tribes, after the rent of the ten Tribes from the other two; <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi>
the firſt King, was choſen by God, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 31. yea and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:124227:41"/>
his ſeed alſo, conditionally, ver. 38. But <hi>Nadah</hi> his ſon, proving
wicked, brake the condition, and cut off the intailment. Their third
King, <hi>Baaſha,</hi> was not <hi>choſen by the people</hi> neither, but was fore-cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
by God, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 14. to do that execution upon the houſe
of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> which is recorded, 1 <hi>King. 15. 27, 28, 29. Elab</hi> their
next King ſucceeded his Father, by right of inheritance, and is no
where ſaid to have been <hi>choſen by the people</hi> into the throne. <hi>Zimri</hi>
the next, was a bloody Traytor and uſurper. The two next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, <hi>Omri and Tibni,</hi> were ſet up indeed by the people, but not
in any way of a lawfull and regular election, but by way of tumult
and faction: and the one partie prevailing, the King followed by
the other, was ſoon ſuppreſſed. <hi>Ahab</hi> the ſon of the prevailing
<hi>King,</hi> without any <hi>election by the people</hi> (except a connivence or
permiſſion, be called an <hi>election</hi>) by the aſcent of deſcent or ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
got up into the throne. After the ſame manner alſo <hi>Ahaziah</hi>
his ſon came to be King. This <hi>Ahaziath</hi> dying without children,
his Brother <hi>Jeboram</hi> (another ſon of <hi>Ahath,</hi> and next to him by
birth, as it ſeems) by the priviledge of his birth came peaceably
to the Kingdom, without any <hi>election by the people</hi> any where heard
of. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 17. The next King, <hi>Jehu</hi> by name, was <hi>choſen by God</hi>
himſelf after a ſpeciall manner, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 1, 2. and his children
after him <hi>to the fourth generation</hi> (2 King. 10. 30.) <hi>to ſit upon the
throne of Iſrael, Shallum,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Ahab</hi> and his race, (their
date of Reiglement being expired) came to the Kingdome by
blood; and is indeed ſaid to have <hi>ſmote Zachariah</hi> (the laſt of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habs</hi>
race) <hi>before the people,</hi> and ſo to have <hi>reigned in his ſtead:</hi> (2
King. 15. 10.) but by what <hi>maxime enle ley,</hi> the murthering of
a King <hi>before the people,</hi> will be interpreted, a being <hi>choſen</hi> King <hi>by
the people,</hi> I underſtand not. <hi>Menahem</hi> his ſucceſſor after a moneths
reigne, found the ſame way to the Kingdome (I mean, by blood)
which his Predeceſſour had chalked out. <hi>Pekahiah</hi> his ſon and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour,
had no other choice we read of, but onely by that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
Nor had <hi>Pekah</hi> who ſucceeded him in the throne, any
other <hi>choice</hi> into this dignitie, but onely by the murther he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
upon his Maſter; except it be ſaid, that he was choſen by
thoſe 52. men who aſſiſted him in that bloody execution. 2. <hi>King.</hi>
15. 25. Nor had <hi>Hoſhea</hi> (the laſt of theſe Kings) any other <hi>choice,</hi>
entrance, or acceſſe we read of unto the Throne, but the ſame with
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:124227:42"/>
his Predeceſſor, a bloodie conſpiracie againſt his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
So that Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> is abſolutely miſtaken in the very bottome
and groundwork of his firſt allegation, affirming the <hi>Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
Parliament, Kings of the Iſraelites, to have been choſen by the
people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. (And laſtly) neither did they <hi>make Laws and Statutes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Religion and Gods worſhip, with his approbation,</hi> except his <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation</hi>
went along with the tranſgreſſion of his <hi>Law.</hi> For by this
they ſtood expreſly charg'd, not to <hi>adde unto the word which he
commanded them, nor</hi> yet <hi>to diminiſh ought from it.</hi> Deut. 4. 2. And
againe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 32. And what <hi>addition</hi> could be made with an
higher hand, or with more provocation in the ſight of God, unto
<hi>this word</hi> of his, then an <hi>enacting Laws and Statutes concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and his worſhip,</hi> whereunto men ſhould ſtand bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to ſubmit, as well as unto the <hi>Lawes</hi> of God themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in this word? Or if it be ſaid, that men were not bound in
conſcience to ſubmit to ſuch <hi>Laws and Statutes,</hi> as well as unto <hi>the
Laws</hi> of God; then were they not to be puniſhed for non-ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to them, unleſſe we will ſay, that men ought to be puniſhed for
ſomewhat elſe, beſides ſin.</p>
            <p>To his ſecond reaſon againſt the Doctrine and Concluſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid,<note place="margin">Sect. 53.</note>
I anſwer, that as <hi>God himſelf uſed the miniſtery, aſſiſtance of
Cyrus, Artaxerxes, Darius, for the building of his Temple, and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his worſhip, for which they made Decrees, Statutes;</hi> ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
he doth expect and require the <hi>miniſtery, aſſiſtance</hi> of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Magiſtrates, Parliaments, and <hi>Laws and Statutes</hi> to be made by
them, for the promotion of his worſhip, But as <hi>Cyrus, Artaxerxes,
Darius, made</hi> no <hi>Decree, Statute,</hi> to diſcourage any of the true <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipers
of God,</hi> nor yet to compell them to any kinde of worſhip,
contrary (in their judgements) to the word of God; or in caſe
they did make, or ſhould have made, any ſuch <hi>Decree, Statute,</hi>
they ſhould have exceeded the limits of their juſt power, and not
have done juſtifiably in the ſight of God; So neither can Chriſtian
Princes, Magiſtrates, commend themſelves unto God in any ſuch
exerciſe of their power, whereby they ſhall conſtraine or enforce
the conſcientious &amp; faithfull ſervants of God to any kind of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
contrary to their conſcience, or by the performance whereof,
condemning it in their judgements for unlawfull, they ſhould pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and condemne themſelves in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:124227:42"/>
To his third Reaſon we anſwer likewiſe;<note place="margin">Sect. 54.</note> that for <hi>moſt Chriſtian
Kings and Magiſtrates in the world,</hi> whether <hi>claiming to be heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
or whether <hi>eligible by the people,</hi> as <hi>the Members of Parliament are,
we CAN without either diſloyaltie or abſurdity, deny them</hi> any ſuch
<hi>Authority in matters of Religion and Church-Government,</hi> whereby
they ſhould be enabled to deſtroy, cruſh, or undo ſuch perſons as
live godlily and peaceably under their juriſdiction, and that for
none other reaſon or offence on their parts, but either for weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in judgement and underſtanding, by reaſon whereof they
cannot ſee the agreeableneſſe of thoſe things that are impoſed on
them, to the Word of God, (in caſe they be indeed ſo qualified) or
elſe for the goodneſſe of their conſcience, which is unwilling to
ſhip-wrack its own peace, by going contrarie to its own light and
dictate. We freely allow to all <hi>Chriſtian Kings and Magiſtrates in
the world,</hi> any <hi>Authoritie</hi> whatſoever <hi>in matters of Religion, Church-Government,</hi>
or in what other cauſes or caſes ſoever it can be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
either by them, or for them, which will not claim or chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
a right of power to puniſhmen for not being as wiſe, as lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
as farre inſighted into <hi>matters of Religion</hi> as themſelves, or for
ſuch matters of fact which are occaſioned directly and meerly by
ſuch defects as theſe. We allow a power to all Magiſtrates to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the wickedneſſe of mens wils; when this diſcovers it ſelf by
any ſutable action in what matters or caſes ſoever: but the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of mens judgements, we conceive cals rather for means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
then matter of puniſhment, from the Magiſtrates hand.
We cannot judge, that the miſtaking of a mans way in a dark con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
deſerves a priſon, or any other ſtroke with the civill
ſword.</p>
            <p>To his fourth we anſwer;<note place="margin">Sect. 55.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. That whereas he affirms, that I <hi>do not onely grant, but argue,
that every private man hath, yea ought to have, power to elect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
his own Miniſter,</hi> cauſing theſe words to be printed in a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
character, as if they were mine, and onely tranſcribed by him,
citing (in his margin) <hi>pag.</hi> 25. 26. as their quarter in my diſcourſe;
the truth is, that this is no fair play; for there is no ſuch line or
juncto of wordseither in either of thoſe pages, or elſewhere in thoſe
Sermons. It never came into my thoughts to think, (nor ſurely
ever iſſued out of my pen) that <hi>every private man hath, or ought to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:124227:43"/>
have a power to conſtitute his own Miniſter.</hi> And beſides he puts a
more quaint and ſubtlle diſtinction upon me, then I am capable of.
I cannot conceive that any <hi>private man hath a power to elect or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
his Miniſter, except he ought to have it.</hi> That <hi>power</hi> which God
hath been pleaſed to conferre upon any man, he both <hi>ought to have,</hi>
and <hi>hath;</hi> though the exerciſe and benefit of that power may be
injuriouſly denied unto him, or withheld from him.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Whereas he further preſumes, that</hi> I will grant, that private
men have power likewiſe to ſet up Independent Congregations, which have
Authoritie to preſcribe ſuch Covenants, Laws and rules of Government,
Diſcipline, worſhip, as themſelves think moſt agreeable to the Word; <hi>and
hereupon demands;</hi> if then they may derive ſuch an Eccleſiaſticall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to Independent Miniſters and Churches, why not as well to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
and Synods likewiſe by the ſelf-ſame reaſon? <hi>I anſwer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That he is miſtaken in his good opinion of my bountie. For
I do not <hi>grant,</hi> either firſt, that all, or every ſort of, <hi>private men
have power to ſet up</hi> any <hi>Independent Congregation.</hi> Or 2. That any
<hi>private</hi> men <hi>have power to ſet up</hi> any ſuch <hi>congregation</hi> conſiſting of
other men then themſelves: but onely to agree together amongſt
themſelves to become ſuch a <hi>congregation.</hi> Or 3. That any <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>
whatſoever hath any <hi>Authoritie</hi> to practiſe, much leſſe <hi>to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe</hi>
either <hi>ſuch Covenants, Laws, Rules of Government, or worſhip,
as themſelves</hi> onely <hi>think moſt agreeable to the Word of God;</hi> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>practiſe</hi> thoſe amongſt themſelves which they <hi>know</hi> to be <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Word of God;</hi> without <hi>preſcribing</hi> either theſe or any other,
unto others. God <hi>gives</hi> no perſon or <hi>Congregation</hi> any <hi>Authoritie</hi>
or power ſo much as to practiſe themſelves what <hi>they</hi> ſimple <hi>think
moſt agreeable to his Word,</hi> but onely that which <hi>REALLY IS agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto his Word;</hi> much leſſe doth he give either the one or the
other any <hi>Authority to preſcribe</hi> their <hi>thinkings</hi> in this kind unto
others. But</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Whereas he demands,</hi> Why private men may not derive an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
Authority unto Parliaments and Synods, as well as unto
Independent Miniſters and Churches; <hi>the account is readie:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. No <hi>private men</hi> whatſoever, can in any ſenſe, neither in
whole, nor in part, <hi>derive any Eccleſiaſticall Authority,</hi> either unto
any <hi>Miniſter,</hi> but onely him, unto whom they commit the charge
of their <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouls; nor unto any <hi>Congregation,</hi> but onely that whereof
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:124227:43"/>
they are members themſelves. Therefore it no wayes follows; <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
men have power to derive Eccleſiaſticall Authoritie</hi> to thoſe <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations</hi>
whereof they are the reſpective members themſelves:
therefore they have the like <hi>power to derive the ſame Authority to
Parliaments, and Synods,</hi> whereof they are no members: Take a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel:
The Aſſiſtants in the Company of Chirurgians, have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in the Government and carriage of the affairs of their own
Companie; therefore they have the ſame intereſt in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the affairs of the Company, of Merchant-taylors.</p>
            <p>2. A perſon qualified for the office and work of the Miniſtery
according to the word of God, is a ſubject capable of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall
Authority;</hi> and may accordingly by perſons Authorized by the
word of God thereunto, be lawfully inveſted with that <hi>power:</hi> But
we have no rule or direction from the word of God either 1. to
judge whether, or when, either Parliaments or Synods are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
capable of Eccleſiaſticall Authoritie: nor 2. is there any rule
or warrant to be found there for the Authorizing of any ſort, or
rank of men, actually to conferre ſuch an <hi>Authority or power,</hi> in caſe
they ſhould be found ſubjects capable of it. Therefore Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi>
arguing in this place, is of no better form, or ſtrength, then this:
<hi>Private men</hi> may do that which Gods Word authorizeth them to
do: therefore they may do that alſo, which Gods Word doth not
authorize them unto. But</p>
            <p>3. (And laſtly) The main foundation and ground-work upon
which he builds the fabrique of his reaſoning here, is an utter
miſtake. For I <hi>neither</hi> grant nor think, that private men, either
when by conſent they firſt congregate themſelves and chuſe a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
or Paſtor over them, much leſſe when they joyn themſelves
to a Congregation already gathered and form'd, do <hi>derive any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
Authority</hi> unto it: but that a company of perſons fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, and conſenting together to become a Church-body or
holy Congregation, have an <hi>Authoritie</hi> (which you may call Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtique,
if you pleaſe; but I ſhall not commend the terme unto
you in this caſe, nor would I willingly call it an <hi>authoritie,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a right or priviledge) derived unto them, not by themſelves,
but from God. Firſt to chuſe unto themſelves a Paſtor, and other
officers, as opportunity ſhall be, ſuch as are recommended in the
Scriptures as meet for ſuch places, and then by, and together, with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:124227:44"/>
theſe to adminiſter and order their Church-affaires, in all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
thereof, according to the word of God, in the name and
authoritie of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe properly, all Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
authoritie is.</p>

            <p>1. By a demurre, whether <hi>God doth oft-times makes uſe of unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
perſons, and the rude multitude</hi> (which I doe not under-value,
becauſe I refuſe to entitle them to a power in Church-matters
greater then ever the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had) <hi>to advance his glory, propagate his
Goſpel, promote his worſhip, vindicate his truth, edifie his Church.</hi> A <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
a <hi>Balaam,</hi> a <hi>Saul,</hi> a <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> a <hi>perſecuting High Prieſt,</hi> were not
<hi>the rude multitude: unſanctified perſons</hi> it is like they were, at leaſt
moſt of them: But God did not <hi>oft-times make uſe either of Balam,
or Saul, or Gamaliel,</hi> or <hi>the perſecuting High Prieſt,</hi> either <hi>to propagate
his Goſpel, promote his worſhip, edifie his Church, &amp;c.</hi> but the Devill
<hi>oft-times made uſe of them</hi> to the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> to hinder <hi>his Goſpel,</hi>
to pollute <hi>his worſhip,</hi> to perſecute <hi>his Church, &amp;c.</hi> And for the
<hi>vulgar multitude,</hi> which he commends as none-ſuch, <hi>for forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to beleeve, follow, profeſſe Chriſt, embrace the Goſpel,</hi> though he
confeſſeth, that <hi>many of them did it for ſiniſter ends;</hi> I anſwer, 1. That
<hi>this multitude</hi> was but one ſwallow, (not a <hi>multitude</hi> of ſwallows)
and therefore not ſufficient to make his ſpring, of <hi>Gods oft-times
uſing the rude multitude</hi> to doe ſuch and ſuch things. 2. They <hi>that
beleeve, follow, profeſſe Chriſt, embrace the Goſpel out of ſiniſter ends,</hi>
when they decline and fall back (as all ſiniſter-ended Profeſſors are
like to doe firſt, or laſt, and as this <hi>vulgar multitude</hi> generally did)
are like more to hinder and ſet back the Goſpel by their declining,
then ever they <hi>propagated</hi> or <hi>promoted</hi> it by their profeſion. But</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Whereas he inferres, that</hi> therefore they may well have power to
chuſe ſuch perſons, who ſhall and may make Lawes, to promote the Goſpel
and Government of the Church of Chriſt; <hi>I anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That Gods power to <hi>make uſe</hi> of <hi>unſanctified perſons, or a rude
multitude</hi> to <hi>promote</hi> the affaires of his <hi>Goſpel, Worſhip, Churches, &amp;c.</hi>
is no argument to prove, that therefore men may commit the care
and truſt of theſe affaires to ſuch <hi>perſons</hi> or <hi>multitudes,</hi> or intereſſe
them in any ſuch power, which it is ten to one but they will uſe
rather in a <hi>deſtructive,</hi> then <hi>promotive</hi> way thereunto. Gods <hi>power</hi>
to <hi>powre out a Spirit of prophecie</hi> upon a perſon altogether ignorant
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:124227:44"/>
of the Scriptures; and ſo <hi>to powre out a Spirit</hi> of grace and holineſſe
upon a graceleſſe and prophane perſon, is no ground or warrant
for a Chriſtian Congregation to chuſe either ſuch an ignorant or
prophane perſon for their Miniſter or Paſtor.</p>
            <p>2. Neither is Gods will, act, or example in this kind, as <hi>viz.</hi>
when to ſhew the ſoveraigntie of his power over and above the
powers of darkneſſe, and the <hi>God of this world;</hi> he makes uſe of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
to give teſtimony unto his Son Jeſus Chriſt, as he did, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.
24. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 34. and ſo to exerciſe the patience of <hi>Job</hi> by afflicting
him, as he did, <hi>Job</hi> 1. Such acts (I ſay) or diſpenſations of God
as theſe, are no grounds for the juſtification of ſuch men, who ſhall
make uſe of the Devill to preach the Goſpel, or to afflict the Saints,
for the exerciſe or improvement of their patience. Therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that ever God hath done (how <hi>oft</hi> ſoever he hath done it)
either <hi>by unſanctified perſons, or by rude multitudes,</hi> for <hi>the propagation
of his Goſpel, the edification of his Church, &amp;c.</hi> doth any waies counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
or warrant men, to inveſt either the one or the other with
ſuch a power, whereby they may endamage and make havock and
ſpoyle both of the one and the other. The reaſon is plaine: becauſe
the evill Spirit that ſaid<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 19. 11.</note>, <hi>Jeſus I know, and Paul I know;</hi> yet ſaid
to the Exorciſts, <hi>but who are yee?</hi> So the powers of ſin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in men, which will tremble at the voyce of God, and forget
their natures and motions at his command, will laugh all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurements
and charmings of men in the face to ſcorne; and will act
their own parts, and drive on their own way with what fury and
violence they pleaſe, notwithſtanding all charges, interceſſions, and
obteſtations of men to the contrary. Therefore no power can with
reaſon, equitie, or conſcience, be put into the hand of ſuch perſons,
(I meane <hi>perſons unſanctified and rude multitudes</hi>) or nominating
whom they pleaſe (I meane from amongſt perſons eligible enough
by the Lawes of the Land either for Parliamentary or Synodicall
intereſt) to umpire in the affaires of the Goſpel, and to make what
<hi>Lawes</hi> they pleaſe for <hi>the government of the Church of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be yet objected and ſaid; But why may not <hi>unſanctified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and rude multitudes</hi> nominate and chuſe ſuch, who by vertue
of ſuch nomination may have power to make <hi>Lawes in matters of
Religion, Worſhip, Government of the Church, &amp;c.</hi> though not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as they pleaſe, yet according to the word of God, and ſuch <hi>as
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:124227:45"/>
are agreeable thereunto?</hi> What inconvenience is there in this? I
anſwer,</p>
            <p>1. By way of conceſſion; that the grant of a power in perſons
ſo nominated and choſen to make Lawes onely of incouragement
and protection to the ſervants of God, in <hi>matters of Religion</hi> and
<hi>Church-Government,</hi> or to order ſome particularities in either, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon incouragements to thoſe that ſhall obey without penall
enactions againſt thoſe that cannot obey, may poſſibly not tend
or ſort to much inconvenience. Nor let any man think, that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
mulcts and penalties are eſſentiall unto Laws, whether <hi>in
matters of Religion, worſhip,</hi> or in any other caſes. <hi>Threatning of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
puniſhment</hi> (ſaith learned M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> one of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
for the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Due right of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>part. 2. pag.</hi> 404.</note> 
               <hi>is not eſſentiall to Lawes
in the generall, becauſe ſome Lawes are ſeconded onely with rewards.</hi>
Yet this inconvenience (it's like) would attend even ſuch a power,
were it granted; Thoſe Lawes which ſhould be made <hi>in matters of
Religion, worſhip, &amp;c.</hi> by men in authoritie, would be of like conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
amongſt the generalitie of men, with the traditions of the
<hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> by which <hi>they made the Commandements of God
of none effect</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 15. 5.</note>; I meane they would ſo intereſſe themſelves in the
hearts and affections of the common ſort of men, that they would
ſoone place more in the obſervation of them, then in keeping the
Commandements of God. An experiment of which inconvenience
we had <hi>in folio,</hi> in the Ceremoniall and ſuperſtitious injunctions of
the late Prelaticall power, when men thought better of themſelves
for ſtanding up at the Creed, joyning in <hi>Gloria Patri, ſecundum uſum
Sarum,</hi> bowing at the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> cringing before an Altar, &amp;c.
then they did of others for hearing the Word of God preached,
with reverence and attention, or for walking in a conſcientious
conformitie unto it. But</p>
            <p>2. If a further power ſhall be granted unto men ſo choſen (I
meane <hi>by unſanctified perſons and rude multitudes,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
them) as <hi>viz. a power of enacting Lawes and Statutes in matters
of Religion, worſhip, &amp;c.</hi> under what mulcts and penalties they pleaſe,
who ſhall judge whether theſe Lawes and Statutes <hi>be agreeable to
the word of God,</hi> or no? If they themſelves, the Law-makers, ſhall be
Judges, miſerable is the condition of the ſervants of God under
them like to be: becauſe it is not to be expected, but that they will
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:124227:45"/>
avouch whatever <hi>Lawes or Statutes</hi> they ſhall make in this kind,
to <hi>be agreeable to the word of God.</hi> The Popiſh Parliaments, during
the reigne of Antichriſtianiſme in the Land, did no leſſe. If the
people, from whom obedience and ſubjection to ſuch <hi>Lawes</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
ſhall be authorized to judge, whether theſe <hi>Lawes be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the word of God,</hi> or no; (which of neceſſitie muſt be granted,
otherwiſe obedience unto them can never be yeelded with a good
conſcience) this will reflect prejudice and diſparagement upon the
wiſdome and prudence of the Law-givers, (and conſequently ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
their Authoritie) eſpecially when any of theſe Judges ſhall
give ſentence <hi>in oppoſitum,</hi> and determine a nullitie in ſuch <hi>Lawes,</hi>
for want of due correſpondence with the word of God. The nomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetique
power or Authoritie, wherever it reſides, will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
honour, intereſt, confirmation or ſtrength to it ſelf, by making
ſuch Lawes, which in their very nature, frame, and conſtitution are
matters of diſpute, and which muſt paſſe and abide the teſts of the
judgements and conſciences of the beſt and wiſeſt of thoſe that are
to yeeld ſubjection unto them, and that with ſo much hazard of
cenſure and contradiction, as Lawes made in matters of <hi>Religion,
worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Church-Government,</hi> alwayes have been and ever will be
<hi>expoſed unto.</hi> The point of <hi>agreeableneſſe to the word of God,</hi> in <hi>Lawes
and Statutes</hi> about matters of Religion, will be a farre longer ſuite
and Queſtion between Legiſlators in that kind, and conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſubjects, then ever any Chancerie ſuite was, or is like to be</p>
            <p>3. To me it is a queſtion, whether in this aſſertion (at leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
according to the proper importance of the words) <hi>Men
have power to make Laws and Statutes in matters of Religion, worſhip,
&amp;c. agreeable to the word of God;</hi> there be not <hi>contradictio in adjuncto</hi>
(as Logicians ſpeak). It is a very hard matter for me to conceive
how any thing ſhould be <hi>agreeable to the Word of God,</hi> at leaſt <hi>in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, worſhip, &amp;c.</hi> but onely that, which for the ſpirit,
matter and ſubſtance of it, is <hi>the word of God</hi> it ſelf. There is no
great <hi>agreeableneſſe</hi> between that which is neceſſarie, and that which
is unneceſſarie; between that which is indulgent and favourable to
the Saints and others in point of libertie, and that which inthrals
and brings them into bondage; between that which is of <hi>divine
inſpiration,</hi> and that which is of humane. Now certain it is, that
whatſoever is impoſed upon men by the <hi>word of God,</hi> is neceſſarie,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:124227:46"/>
and of <hi>divine inſpiration;</hi> and whatſoever <hi>the word of God</hi> doth not
impoſe upon men, it doth it in a way of a gracious libertie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
unto men. And as certain it is, that whatſoever ſhall be
impoſed upon the Saints or others by men, eſpecially <hi>in matters of
Religion, worſhip, &amp;c.</hi> which for the matter and ſubſtance of it is
not the very <hi>word of God</hi> it ſelf, is firſt unneceſſarie, (for otherwiſe
we muſt make the Word of God imperfect, and defective even in
matters of neceſſitie, which is Popery in the higheſt) and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it is but of humane <hi>inſpiration,</hi> except we hold Enthuſiaſme,
and the revelations eccentrick to the Scriptures are yet authentique
and of propheticall authority: thirdly (and laſtly) it is an abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the libertie, a cancelling of that indulgence, wherewith
God in his Word hath gratified the world. Therefore whatſoever
ſhall be impoſed by men upon men in <hi>matter of Religion, worſhip,
&amp;c.</hi> under a pretence of an <hi>agreeableneſſe to the word of God,</hi> in caſe
it be not (in the ſenſe declared) the very <hi>word of God</hi> it ſelf, it can
have no other <hi>agree thleneſſe with this word,</hi> then <hi>Pelop's</hi> ſhoulder,
which (if Poets feign not) was made of yvorie, had with the other
limbs and members of his body which were all living and ſound
fleſh. Yea and whether any <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Statute,</hi> can in any ſenſe be
ſaid to be <hi>agreeable to the word of God,</hi> which ſhall make the Saints
ſervants and bondmen, where <hi>God in his Word</hi> hath either made
them, or left them free, I refer to further and more mature conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
But</p>
            <p>4. And laſtly, Suppoſe it were granted, as a thing convenient,
that ſome ſhould be intruſted or inveſted with a power of making
Laws and Statutes <hi>in matters of Religion, worſhip, &amp;c.</hi> provided they
be <hi>agreeable to the Word of God;</hi> yet in aſmuch as the making of ſuch
Laws and Statutes upon ſuch terms, neceſſarily requireth the moſt
exact and profound knowledge and underſtanding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
I cannot conceive that <hi>unſanctified perſons,</hi> or <hi>rude multitudes,</hi>
ſhould be Authorized by God, or by any principle of ſound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to have the <hi>nomination</hi> or <hi>election</hi> of thoſe men; but rather
another Generation, who may in reaſon be conceived to have a
more excellent ſpirit of diſcerning of ſuch abilities in men, then
they. When men ſtand in need of the help and adviſe of a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
Lawyer, or Divine, they do not addreſſe themſelves to a
company of <hi>children playing</hi> together <hi>in the market place,</hi> (as our
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:124227:46"/>
Saviour ſpeaks<note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 7. 32.</note>) to nominate or vote amongſt them, what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in any of theſe profeſſions they ſhould imploy &amp; commit their
concernments unto. No more did God ever iſſue any commiſſion
out of Heaven to <hi>unſanctified perſons, rude multitudes,</hi> men ignorant
of God and of the Scriptures, to nominate or chuſe for him, who,
or what men he ſhould imploy to make <hi>Lawes and Statutes</hi> for his
Saints and Churches, <hi>in matters of Religion,</hi> and which concerne
his <hi>worſhip.</hi> A man of ordinary diſcretion, and that knows any
thing of the nature or diſpoſition of the Fox, will never chuſe a
Fox to be his Caterer (as our Engliſh Proverb hath it).</p>
            <p>To his ſixt and laſt Argument, I anſwer, and end.</p>
            <p>1. That it is not alwayes found, that <hi>thoſe who have no skill at all
in Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 57.</note> 
               <hi>Phyſicke, or Architecture, have yet judgement and reaſon enough
to make choyce of the beſt Lawyers, Phyſicians, Architects, when they need
their help.</hi> If this were true, theſe profeſſions would prove malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
unto, and eat up the far greateſt part of their own children
and profeſſors: there would be very few in any of them, that ever
ſhould have imployments. For who is there that would ſet a bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
on work, that <hi>hath judgement and reaſon enough</hi> to chuſe a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-workman?
Eſpecially conſidering what our Engiſh Proverb
ſaith; <hi>The beſt, is beſt cheape.</hi> There is no man will ride upon an ox,
that may have a well-manag'd and mettal'd gelding to carrie him.
But</p>
            <p>2. Suppoſe it ſhould be granted, as univerſally true, that <hi>men
who have no skill at all in the</hi> ſaid profeſſions, <hi>yet had judgement and
reaſon enough to make choyce of the beſt</hi> in every of them reſpectively,
<hi>when they ſtood in need of their help;</hi> yet this ſuppoſition muſt be made
withall, that theſe <hi>beſt</hi> Practitioners, which according to the other
ſuppoſition will <hi>be choſen,</hi> have given a ſufficient account &amp; proofe,
and that to publick ſatisfaction of their reſpective abilities in their
ſeverall profeſſions. Otherwiſe how ſhall they who have no skill
in their profeſſions, come to know or underſtand, ſo much as by
conjecture, who are the beſt in them? This being ſo, Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi>
compariſon or parallel, halts right-downe. Becauſe many of thoſe,
who are by the Laws of the Land eligible into places of Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
truſt and power, yea, haply many of thoſe who are of the beſt
and richeſt accompliſhment for the diſcharge of that part of this
truſt, which Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> will needs ſuppoſe belongeth to them, (I
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:124227:47"/>
meane in making Lawes <hi>in matters of Religion, worſhip, Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
&amp;c. agreeable to the word of God</hi>) never have given any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
account or proofe (nor perhaps ever had opportunitie to doe
it) of thoſe abilities which God hath given them in that kinde.
And if ſo, how ſhould the <hi>rude multitudes,</hi> or the generalitie of the
people ever come to know or underſtand who are the beſt or fitteſt
men to be choſen into thoſe great places of truſt and power?</p>
            <p>3. When men <hi>ſtand in need of the help either of a Lawyer, Phyſician,
or Architect,</hi> it is a far eaſier matter to know how to chuſe a man
in any of theſe profeſſions, without running the hazard of much
detriment in his occaſions, then it is for men to know how to chuſe
men tolerably qualified for Parliamentary imployment; eſpecially,
if one part of this imployment conſiſts <hi>in making Lawes &amp; Statutes
in matters of Religion, worſhip, &amp;c. agreeable to the word of God.</hi> The
reaſon of the difference is plaine: Recourſe is made to <hi>Lawyers</hi> (and
ſo to <hi>Phyſicians, Architects</hi> reſpectively) onely for one kind of help
or <hi>imployment,</hi> and that ſuch which is proper to their profeſſion,
and wherein their abilitie and ſufficiencie, is or very poſſibly may
be ſufficiently knowne; But Parliamentarie ſervice or imployment
conſiſting (according to Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> notion) as well in making
<hi>Church-lawes, in matters of Religion, worſhip, &amp; agreeable to the word
of God,</hi> as in framing Laws politique, to accommodate the civill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of the Common-wealth (which are imployments of a very
differing nature, hardly incident unto, and very rarely found in
one and the ſame perſon) it muſt needs be conceived to be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of very great difficultie, and requiring a very choyce and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ſpirit of diſcerning, to make a commendable, yea, or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
choice of men for that inveſtiture and truſt. Yea, himſelf
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> acknowledgeth little leſſe then an utter inconſiſtencie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
abilities in one and the ſame perſon, for theſe ſo different
imployments; For here he requires, both <hi>Politicians and States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
os fit to be conſulted with a ſuit a Church-Government to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
State, and likewiſe an Aſſembly of Divines, to ſquare it by, and to
the word.</hi> But in as much as whatſoever <hi>an Aſſembly of Divines</hi> ſhall
determine in or about <hi>Churh-Government,</hi> or other <hi>matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
cannot paſſe into an Act, Law, or Statute, but by the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veening
of Parliamentarie intereſt upon their determinations and
there beeing every whit as great (if not farre greater) abilities in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:124227:47"/>
Divinitie and knowledge of the Scriptures, requiſite to enable men
rightly to diſcerne and judge, whether a <hi>Church-Government,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Deciſion in matter of Religion, be agreeable to the word of
God, as there are to diſcourſe and make out that in either kind
which is agreeable thereunto; yea and further, it being no waies
either Chriſtian or reaſonable, that a Parliament ſhould paſſe
that into an Act, Law, or Statute, as <hi>agreeable to the word of God,</hi>
and obliege an whole Kingdome under mulcts and penalties to
ſubmit unto it accordingly, which themſelves are not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
whether it be indeed agreeable unto the word of God, or no;
theſe three things (I ſay) duly conſidered, evident it is, that it is
a matter almoſt of infinite difficultie, (and therefore not ſo obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to <hi>unſanctified perſons, and rude multitudes,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> would
carrie it) to diſcerne or make choice of perſons of a due temper
and compoſition for Parliamentarie operations, Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
being admitted, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>making Lawes in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
as well as in civill affaires, is a part of theſe operations. <hi>To
ſet then his compariſon upright, wee muſt ſtate it thus:</hi> Suppoſe Mr.
<hi>Prynne</hi> were of none of the three Profeſſions he ſpeaks of, neither
Lawyer, nor Phyſician, nor Architect, but ſtood in need of the
help of them all, having 1. a ſuite at Law of very great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to him; 2. a dangerous diſtemper or diſeaſe upon his body;
3. an houſe to build for his neceſſary accommodation; and in this
poſture of neceſſities, were neceſſitated or limited to make choyce
of three men, but all of one and the ſame profeſſion, either all
Lawyers, or all Phyſicians, or all Architects, to miniſter unto him
in all his reſpective concernments and neceſſities; I beleeve that
under ſuch a conſtellation of circumſtances and occaſions as theſe,
though he be a man of farre greater <hi>judgement and reaſon,</hi> then the
generalitie of men are, yet he would not find it ſo eaſie a matter
to ſatisfie himſelf in the choyce of his men within the compaſſe of
any one of the three profeſſions. <hi>This is the true ſtate</hi> and caſe of the
difficultie of Parliamentarie Elections, upon Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Parliamentarie intereſt and power.</p>
            <p>4. Suppoſe yet further,<note place="margin">Sect. 58.</note> that <hi>unſanctified perſons and rude multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
had skill enough to elect the moſt eminent and ableſt men for</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
<hi>ſervice;</hi> yet who knoweth not but that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
(yea, much) more then knowledge of what is a mans du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:124227:48"/>
required to make him willing to doe it. <hi>To him that knoweth
to doe good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin</hi> (ſaith <hi>James) Jam.</hi> 4. 17.
It is no wayes reaſonable to think, that <hi>unſanctified perſons,</hi> and
men addicted to ſinfull luſts and pleaſures, ſhould willingly and
by the ducture of their own inclinations, put a power of making
Lawes into the hands of ſuch men, who they know are profeſſed
enemies to thoſe lawleſſe waies of theirs, and therefore are like,
being intereſſed in ſuch a power, to make Lawes for the reſtraint
and puniſhment of them. That God, when he pleaſeth, may by an
extraordinarie hand of Providence, over-rule the natures and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of men in this kind, and ſerve <hi>unfanctified perſons</hi> in their
Parliamentary Elections, as he did the <hi>Syrian</hi> hoſt of old, which he
led blindfold into <hi>the midst of Samaria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 6. 20.</note> when they thought they
had been going to <hi>Dothan,</hi> is not denied; yea, it is acknowledged,
that in grace and mercy to this Nation, he hath ſtretched out that
very hand of Providence we ſpeake of in the choyce of many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Honourable Aſſembly of Parliament; whoſe perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in a faithfull diſcharge of their imployment, declares, that
their Election was more from God, then from men. Therefore
that <hi>one word</hi> of Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> which follows <hi>p. 24. viz.</hi> That <hi>the
choyce which your vileſt and moſt unworthy of men have made this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
may for ever refute this childiſh reaſon, the corner ſtone of your
Independent fabrique faſtened together with Independent crotchets, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to abide the Teſt;</hi> this <hi>one word</hi> (I ſay) is no <hi>word</hi> either of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or of truth. An happy election made by men over-acted by
God in the action, doth no more prove either a proportionable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of wiſdome, or a ſutableneſſe of affection in ſuch perſons to
make ſuch a choyce, then that praiſe which God <hi>hath ordained,</hi>
and which he accordingly draws <hi>out of the mouths of babes and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi>
proves theſe <hi>babes and ſucklings</hi> to be indued with a naturall
ſtrength and abilitie of yeelding ſuch <hi>praiſe</hi> unto God: or then
the ſervice which the Ravens did the Prophet in bringing unto
him bread and fleſh duly morning and evening<note n="a" place="margin">1 King. 17. 6.</note>, proves that
they had a principle of reaſon and underſtanding, to know and to
conſider the neceſſities of godly and faithfull men; or that ſuch
men ought to renounce their eſtates and callings, and to depend
upon Ravens for their ſuſtenance. And beſides, how doth the <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi>
of ſo many members of this Parliament, who ſtand by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:124227:48"/>
their truſt with faithfulneſſe and honour, more <hi>refute;</hi> then the
<hi>election</hi> of ſo many unworthy ones, who have not onely turned
their back, but head alſo upon both, confirm <hi>my reaſon?</hi> not to
mention ſo many <hi>elections</hi> as have been made both in Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
dayes, and many a time before theſe, of ſuch members, who
made many a <hi>Law as agreeable to the Word of God,</hi> as harp is to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
Which further ſhews, of how ſlender eſteeme in point of
truth, that aſſertion of his <hi>pa.</hi> 23. is: where he ſaith, <hi>that thoſe that
are unjit or unable to be Members of Parliament themſelves, yet have
had wiſdom enough in all ages, and eſpecially at this preſent, to elect the
muſt eminent and ableſt men for ſuch a ſervice.</hi> So that if my pen were
not more baſhfull then Mr. <hi>Prynnes,</hi> it would ſay, that the Reaſon
Defendant is by many degrees more <hi>childiſh</hi> then the Reaſon Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe:
and that this <hi>Presbyterian</hi> engins wherewith he makes account
to batter my <hi>Independent Fabrick,</hi> are made of <hi>Independent</hi> metall,
able to do no execution at all. There is not one brick or tyle in all
my <hi>Independent Fabrick,</hi> as yet bruiſed, crack'd or ſhaken, by all the
hot and loud play of Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> artillery againſt it. But</p>
            <p>5.<note place="margin">Sect. 59.</note> 
               <hi>Whereas in further proſecution of this laſt reaſon, he argues
thus:</hi> If the common people, which neither are, nor can be Parliaments,
Emperours, Kings, Judges, Magiſtrates, Miniſters, have yet a lawfull
power to make others ſuch, by their bare election, &amp; to give them ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and power as themſelves never actually were, nor can be poſſeſſors
of; then why by the ſelf ſame reaſon may they not likewiſe delegate a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Eccleſiaſticall Legiſlative Authoritie in Church affairs to their elected
Parliamentary and Synodicall members, which was never actually in
themſelves, as well as Mr. Goodwin delegate the power of determining who
ſhould be fit perſons to receive the Sacrament, and to become members of
his Independent Congregation, to eight ſelect Subſtitutes, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
actually veſted in himſelf, nor transferible thus to others by any Law
of God, or man? <hi>In anſwer (paſſing by the Grammatical illegality
of the period</hi>)</p>
            <p>1. That Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> never <hi>delegated the power he</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>of
determining who,</hi> &amp;c. to any Subſtitutes; but this <hi>delegation</hi> was
made reſpectively by thoſe, who had <hi>power,</hi> (yea haply and dutie
too) <hi>by the Law</hi> of God, and <hi>power</hi> ſufficient <hi>by the Law of man,</hi> to
referre themſelves for matter of examination and triall touching
their <hi>fitneſſe for the Sacrament,</hi> unto perſons of competent abilities
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:124227:49"/>
for ſuch a Chriſtian ſervice. Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> pen is (I think) the moſt
unhappie and un-ſucceſſefull in matters of impeachment and
charge, that ever conteſted againſt the miſdemeanors of men; it
ſeldome or never lays the indictment right. Here he chargeth me
with <hi>delegating</hi> ſuch and ſuch a <hi>power to eight Substitutes;</hi> a little
after, that <hi>I have wilfully, yea and preſumptuouſly undermined the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
priviledges of Parliament by the very roots:</hi> a little before, that
I <hi>ſcandalouſly terme the Commonaltie of the Land, the vileſt and moſt
unworthy of men:</hi> not long before this (<hi>viz.</hi> pa. 21.) that I <hi>preach but
ſeldome to my Pariſhioners: that I receive their tithes: that I gather an
Independent Congregation to my ſelf:</hi> that <hi>I preſcribe a Covenant unto
them before they be admitted members of it:</hi> that <hi>I preach to theſe alone,
neglecting my Pariſhioners,</hi> &amp;c. in all which ſuggeſtions and charges
there is but one and the ſame proportion of love and truth.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas he ſuppoſeth that <hi>the common people, by their bare ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
give ſuch an Authority and power, to Parliaments, Emperours,
Kings, &amp;c. as themſelves never actually were, nor can be poſſeſſours of;</hi>
he doth not (I conceive) ſpeak like a man of his profeſſion; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
I am, that he doth not ſpeak the truth; no, nor yet the
thoughts of men of learning and judgement in the point. For 1.
(to reaſon the caſe a little in point of truth) if the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were not <hi>actually poſſeſſed of that Authority and power, which by
their election they give to Parliaments, Emperours, Kings, &amp;c.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
how, or after what manner they were <hi>poſſeſſed of it?</hi> For in
ſaying, <hi>they were not ACTVALLY poſſeſſed of it,</hi> he ſuppoſes and
grants, that they were ſome wayes or other poſſeſſed of it. No
man excludes one ſpeciall modification from a thing, but for the
gratification of another. Now then if <hi>the common people were not
ACTVALLY poſſeſſed</hi> of that Authority and power which by their
election they give unto Parliaments, Emperours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were onely
<hi>potentially poſſeſſed</hi> of it. For <hi>actually and potentially,</hi> are <hi>oppoſita;</hi>
yea and of that kind which they call <hi>oppoſita immediata.</hi> So that
whatſoever is had or poſſeſſed by any, and not <hi>actually,</hi> muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue
be had or poſſeſſed <hi>potentially,</hi> and <hi>potentially</hi> onely (at leaſt
in reſpect of an <hi>actuall</hi> poſſeſſion.) Now then I reaſon firſt thus: If
the <hi>people</hi> have <hi>that power</hi> though not <hi>actually,</hi> yet potentially,
which <hi>by their election they give to Parliaments, Emperours, Kings, &amp;c.</hi>
then are they capable of it even <hi>actually</hi> alſo; which yet Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:124227:49"/>
here plainly denies, in theſe words, <hi>Nor can be poſſeſſours of.</hi> The
conſequence is undeniable: For whatſoever any entire ſubject
hath, or is, <hi>potentiâ;</hi> there is no impoſſibilitie but that it may have,
or be, <hi>actu,</hi> or actually. So that Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> is here upon the matter
in an abſolute contradiction. For he ſuppoſeth that the people
may have that Authoritie or power <hi>potentially,</hi> which yet he ſaith
is unpoſſible they ſhould ever have actually. Again, I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
for the bettering of mine underſtanding, know and learn,
how any perſon, or other Agent whatſoever, can <hi>actually</hi> conferre
that upon, or communicate that unto another, which it hath one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>potentially</hi> it ſelf. Water, whileſt it is <hi>actually</hi> cold, and onely
<hi>potentially</hi> hot, cannot heat that which is put into it. Nor can a
man that is <hi>actually</hi> ignorant of ſuch or ſuch a truth, and <hi>potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
onely knowing it, <hi>actually</hi> communicate or impart the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
thereof unto another, by vertue of that <hi>potentiall</hi> knowledge
which he hath. No more can a <hi>people</hi> that is onely <hi>potentially poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
of any Authority or power, actually give</hi> or conferre it upon any,
whether <hi>Parliaments, Emperours, Kings, &amp;c.</hi> The ground of all
ſuch conſequences as theſe, is that common principle or maxime in
reaſon: <hi>Modus operandi ſequitur modum eſſendi.</hi> Things that have
but a weak or imperfect being themſelves, cannot give ſtrength or
perfection of being unto others. But had Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> ſaid the body
of a Nation have that authority really, vertually, eminently, and
collectively, which they cannot have formally, diſtributively, and
exemptively; I ſhould have had the leſſe to ſay unto him.</p>
            <p>For the judgement of men learned in matters of this concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
he that ſhall pleaſe to read the Diſcourſe of <hi>Chriſtophorus
Beſoldus,</hi> intituled, <hi>Diſſertatio Politico-Juridica de Majeſtate in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,
&amp;c.</hi> ſhall find a little Jurie of Lawyers joyning with him in
the verdict of his judgement upon the caſe; the tenor whereof is,
that there is not onely an Authoritie or power, but (that which is
ſomewhat more) a <hi>majeſtie</hi> alſo <hi>in the people, which is coevall with
the Republique or common-wealth it ſelf; and which continues as long
as the body thereof remains, yea and ſtands firm under all vacancies of
Perſonall Empire, and all alterations and changes of Government: in
which reſpect he ſaith it may be called the foundation or ground-work of
the Common-wealth.</hi> This majeſtie in the people he cals, <hi>Reall;</hi> that
<hi>in the King</hi> or chief Ruler, <hi>Perſonall:</hi> this he ſaith, <hi>ſtill fals and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:124227:50"/>
with the death of the perſon inveſred with it; and returns</hi> to the
people, or <hi>commonwealth.</hi> Yea and adds, that <hi>the people in</hi> making
or ſetting up a King over them, <hi>transferre onely a power of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring,
not of conſtituting the common-wealth.</hi> With more to like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

clearly is, that the people have <hi>Really or actually,</hi> that Authority or

Rulers and Governours.</p>
            <p>3. (<hi>And laſtly, for this) whereas he affirmeth, that ſuch a power,
as he ſuppoſeth to have been delegated by me</hi> to eight Subſtitutes, is
not tranſcrible to others by any Law of God or man; <hi>and yet demands,</hi>
Why the common people may not as well delegate a Lawfull Eccleſiaſticall
legiſlative Authoritie in Church-affaires unto their elected Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
and Synodall members, as I delegate ſuch a power; <hi>I anſwer and
confeſſe, that they may every whit as well (and no whit better</hi>)
delegate ſuch an Authoritie to ſuch their members, <hi>as I</hi> delegate <hi>ſuch a
power to my Subſtitutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. <hi>Whereas in proſecution of his laſt argument,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 60.</note> 
               <hi>he further ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
and interrogates thus;</hi> Why may not a man bring an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
or ſpirituall extraction out of a ſecular roote, as well as a Regall,
Magiſteriall, Parliamentall, Miniſteriall extraction out of a meere po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
or ſervile roote? or the beſt ſtrong waters out of the vileſt lees?
the richeſt mineralls out of the courſeſt earth? the moſt Orient pearles, out
of the baſeſt Oyſters? <hi>I anſwer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That no <hi>Regall, Magiſteriall, Parliamentall, Miniſteriall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
can be made out of a meere ſervile roote.</hi> A people <hi>meerely ſervile,</hi>
can have no libertie or power to appoint or chuſe unto themſelves
either Kings, Maſters, Parliaments, or Miniſters. Therefore Mr.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:124227:50"/>
               <hi>Prynnes</hi> Queſtion very truly imports, that the one <hi>extraction</hi> may
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s well be made, as the other; but it no waies proves a poſſibilitie
of either.</p>
            <p>2. There is a plain reaſon, why and how a <hi>Regall, Magiſteriall,
Parliamentall extraction may be made out of a popular roote:</hi> but there
is a loud reclamation in reaſon and Religion both, againſt a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie
of making a <hi>ſpirituall extraction out of a ſecular roote. Regall,
Magiſteriall, Parliamentall extractions,</hi> are in their reſpective natures
and tendencies, means proportioned to the civill and temporall
ends, or good of the people; and God having endued men, (I
meane the common ſort or generalitie of men, <hi>the people</hi>) with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and underſtanding to accommodate and provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in ſuch things as theſe, hath given them power accordingly
to make uſe of ſuch principles and endowments in a regular way,
for the accompliſhment and obtaining of ſuch ends. Now civill
Rule and Government being a naturall, proper, and direct means,
whereby a good ſocietie or communitie of men may beſt obtaine a
civill or politique good, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſafe, juſt, and peaceable living and
converſing together in the world; God therefore hath given them
a libertie and power to contrive and caſt themſelves into what
forme of Government they ſhould judge moſt conducible to ſuch
ends. Upon which indulgence or grant from Heaven, they have a
lawfull power by conſent among themſelves to elect and chuſe
whom they pleaſe to governe them, and that upon ſuch terms, as
they conceive moſt agreeable to thoſe ends. And yet even in this
Government it ſelf, one communitie or corporation of men have
no right or lawfulneſſe of power, to chuſe or appoint either Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
or Governors over another: leaſt of all hath any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie,
conſiſting of men altogether uncivill, ignorant, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced
in matters of Government, any lawfulneſſe of power
to appoint either Rule or Rulers over other Societies, whoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
generally are of a better accompliſhment, for civilitie, &amp; parts
of wiſdome, learning, and underſtanding; But all ſocieties of men
ſince the diſſolution of the Judaicall politie, are left free by God
and nature, to ſet over themſelves what Government and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
they ſhall judge of beſt accommodation, for their temporall
ſafety and peace. But now in ſpirituall things, and matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the caſe is farre otherwiſe; differing as much from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:124227:51"/>
as the Heavens from the Earth. God hath not endued the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitie
of men with ſpirituall wiſdome and underſtanding, nor
with the knowledge of thoſe things which are of a ſupernaturall
concernment unto them; and conſequently hath not inveſted them
with any power of caſting themſelves into what forme of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they pleaſe in reſpect of theſe, nor of chuſing whom they
pleaſe to rule over them, no nor yet of appointing upon what
terms they will be governed in theſe. <hi>The naturall man</hi> (ſaith the
Scripture) <hi>perceiveth not</hi> (or, receiveth not) <hi>the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God; for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him: neither can he know them,
becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. Now certaine it is,
that the farre greater part of men in every State Politique or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
are <hi>naturall</hi> men, and conſequently <hi>perceive not the things of
the Spirit of God. Many are called,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>but few choſen.</hi>
And 2. as certaine it is, that God doth not intereſſe or inveſt any
man or men, with a power of interpoſing in ſuch things, which are
not of their cognizance, and whereof they have no knowledge or
perceivance. Much leſſe 3. hath he given a power to <hi>naturall men
who perceive not the things of the Spirit of God,</hi> to appoint Rulers and
Governors in theſe, over men that are <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> and which doe
<hi>perceive</hi> them. This were to give a power unto <hi>the blind, to lead</hi> not
the <hi>blind</hi> onely, but even <hi>the ſeeing</hi> alſo. Nay, 4. and laſtly, God
hath not given unto <hi>ſpirituall men</hi> themſelves any power to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
or chuſe men, to make any new Lawes or Articles in matters
of <hi>Religion, Worſhip, Church-Government, &amp;c.</hi> but onely to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
execute and teach thoſe, which are already ordained and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by God himſelf, as hath been prov'd already. Thus then
we ſee there is reaſon enough and to ſpare, why ſuch <hi>a ſpirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction</hi>
as the two Brethren ſpeak of, cannot be made <hi>out of a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
roote;</hi> though <hi>a Regall, Magiſteriall, Parliamentall extraction,</hi>
may well be <hi>made out of a popular roote.</hi> But</p>
            <p>3. Whereas Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> ſuppoſeth that a <hi>Miniſteriall Extraction</hi>
(as he calleth it) is, or may be <hi>made out of a meere popular or ſervile
roote,</hi> this ſuppoſition is not made without oppoſition to the truth.
For no <hi>people</hi> or men, <hi>meerly</hi> ſuch, that is, as they are ſimply <hi>people</hi>
or men, have any power delegated unto them by God or by Chriſt,
to ſet a Miniſter or Paſtor over them; neither can they as meerly
ſuch, by any call, election, or ordination whatſoever, conferre a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:124227:51"/>
Paſtorall office or dignitie upon any man. The reaſon is, becauſe
it is an eſſentiall propertie or part of the Paſtorall office, to feed,
rule, and governe a flock of Chriſts ſheep<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 20. 28. 1 Pet. 5. 2.</note>, (I meane a Societie,
or company of ſuch perſons, who in the judgement of charitie are
to be reputed ſuch) and to adminiſter the ſeales of the Covenant
ordinarily unto them, &amp;c. Now no company of men, meerly and
ſimply as men, have any power to inveſt any man, with any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative
power to performe either of thoſe adminiſtrations. One
company or ſocietie of men however qualified, cannot derive any
Authoritative power upon any man, to performe the office of a
Paſtor to another ſocietie of men. Therefore except that company
of men, which calls and chuſeth a perſon into the place or office
of a Paſtor (as it ſuppoſeth) be ſuch a flock of Chriſt as was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
their act in ſo calling and chuſing, is but a nullitie; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
called hath indeed and in truth no Paſtorall inveſtiture upon
him by vertue of ſuch a call. As for example; Suppoſe a company
of ignorantly prophane, and deſperately debauch'd men, ſhould
make choyce of a man of worth, to be a Paſtor unto them; the man
thus called and choſen, hath no authoritie or power hereby, either
to feed or govern any flock of Chriſt, (no, not ſo much as any flock
of Chriſt in appearance) or to adminiſter the ſeales of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
unto any; and conſequently is made no Paſtor thereby.</p>
            <p>Or if Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> meaning be, that <hi>a root meerly popular,</hi> that is,
any company of people whatſoever, may lawfully call or chuſe a
man to preach the Goſpel unto them, and in this ſenſe be ſaid to
make a Miniſter; I anſwer; that the man thus called, is no more
a Miniſter then he was before; nor hath he any more <hi>Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power</hi> to preach the Goſpel unto them, by vertue of ſuch a call,
then he had without it; onely he hath thereby a greater opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
and a more ſpeciall invitation from the providence of God
to preach the Goſpel unto thoſe who ſo call him, then unto others.
Therefore in this caſe there is <hi>no miniſteriall extraction</hi> made out of
a <hi>meere popular roote.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Whereas</hi> he ſpeaks parables,<note place="margin">Sect. 61.</note> 
               <hi>and further demands,</hi> Why not a
ſpirituall extraction out of a ſecular roote, as well as the beſt ſtrong waters
out of the vileſt lees? the richeſt mineralls out of the courſeſt earth? the
moſt Orient pearles out of the baſeſt Oyſters? <hi>I anſwer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That I know not by what rule of true ſpeaking, Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:124227:52"/>
either calls thoſe the <hi>baſeſt oyſters,</hi> out of which the <hi>moſt orient pearls,</hi>
or that the <hi>courſeſt earth,</hi> out of which <hi>the richeſt mineralls,</hi> or thoſe
the <hi>vileſt lees,</hi> out of which <hi>the beſt ſtrong waters</hi> are extracted. That
expreſſion of the Poet,—<hi>Veios habitante Camillo, —<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
fuit,</hi> I never yet heard cenſured by any. Noble births and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
ennoble Cities and Countries.<note place="margin">Mat. 2. 6.</note> 
               <hi>And thou Bethlehem in the
land of Juda, art not the leaſt among the Princes of Juda: for out of thee
ſhall come a Governor that ſhall rule my people Iſrael.</hi> By the conſent of
this principle, which hath teſtimony both from God and men,
thoſe are not the <hi>baſeſt,</hi> but the nobleſt <hi>oyſters,</hi> which give birth and
breeding to the <hi>moſt ortent pearles;</hi> nor that the <hi>courſeſt,</hi> but the fineſt
and beſt <hi>earth,</hi> that yeelds <hi>the richeſt mineralls;</hi> nor thoſe the <hi>vileſt,</hi>
but the moſt generous and beſt deſerving <hi>lees,</hi> which gratifie their
Diſtillator with the <hi>beſt ſtrong waters.</hi> But</p>
            <p>2. (Not to impoſe any tax upon an acyrologie) there is this
plain reaſon, why <hi>no ſpirituall extraction out of a ſecular roote,</hi> though
all thoſe other <hi>extractions</hi> may be made out of thoſe reſpective <hi>roots</hi>
appropriated unto them: becauſe a man may very poſſibly find a
thing where it is; but it is unpoſſible for him to find it where it is
not. A man may very eaſily and very lawfully <hi>extract</hi> five ſhillings
out of his purſe that hath five ſhillings, or more, in it: but he that
ſhall undertake to make an <hi>extraction</hi> of five ſhillings, out of a purſe
that is emptie, muſt <hi>Acheronta movere,</hi> make himſelf a debtor to the
black art. The <hi>pearle</hi> is in the <hi>oyſter,</hi> and the <hi>minerall in the Earth,</hi>
and the <hi>ſtrong water</hi> in the <hi>lee:</hi> and therefore it is no great matter
for art and nature joyning together, partly by allurement and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,
partly by a ſtronger and more forcible hand, to ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
all theſe from their native and proper elements, and to draw
them out of their dark and ſecret habitations. Nor is it any waies
unlawfull thus to practiſe upon them, becauſe God hath not ſerv'd
any prohibition upon men, to inhibite any ſuch extractions or
ſeparations, either in a naturall or artificiall way. But there
is no ſuch <hi>ſpirituall extraction</hi> as the two Brethren ſpeak of, in
their <hi>ſecular roote:</hi> there is no <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Legiſlative power in
matters of Religion, worſhip, and Church-Government,</hi> neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,
nor eminently, in <hi>unſanctified perſons, rude multitudes,</hi> men
ignorant of God, &amp;c. therefore no ſuch power can by any <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction</hi>
whatſoever, proceed or be drawne out of theſe. There
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:124227:52"/>
is indeed a lawfulneſſe of power in them (if they had a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to incline them to the due exerciſe of it) to aſſiſt the ſervants
of God againſt violence and wrong, to incourage and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
them in well-doing, to admoniſh and reprove them for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any ſuch evill which falls within the compaſſe of their cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
yea, there is a lawfulneſſe of power in them, if they have
not given it out of their hands already, and inveſted others with
it, to make Lawes for the regulation of the Saints themſelves, in all
their civill affaires, and to reſtraine them by mulcts and penalties
from all ſuch courſes, actions, and practices, which are properly
and in their natures diſſerviceable unto the common peace,
and weal-publick: And all ſuch power as this, they may lawfully
deviſe, and demiſe unto perſons meet for the manage and exerciſe
of it; becauſe in this caſe they doe but give of their own; yea, they
give it in a regular and rationall way; upon which termes
God hath given unto every man a liberty or power <hi>to doe with his
owne what he pleaſeth</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 20. 15.</note>. But the perſons we now ſpeak of, never had
a power of regulating the Saints in their Religious or Spirituall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
or of compelling them under temporal mulcts and penalties,
to order themſelves in the worſhip and ſervice of God, as they
pleaſed, or to preach and teach onely ſuch points and doctrines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, as they ſhould think well of. Therefore how they
ſhould convey or make over any ſuch power as this unto others,
by a Title or Conveyance good in Law, I deſire Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.
If his deſire had been to have paralleld the Brethrens <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
extraction out of a Secular root,</hi> with naturall compariſons or
ſimilitudes, he ſhould have done it not with thoſe which hee hath
made uſe of in this kind, or the like; for we have ſhewed a manifeſt
and main diſproportion in them; but with theſe, and ſuch as theſe
which follow: <hi>Why not a ſpirituall extraction out of a Secular root,</hi>
as well as a man out of a mouſe, or of water out of a flint, or of
the element of fire out of the midſt of the Sea? He might rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough have argued and concluded here; <hi>Why not the one as well
as the other?</hi> But</p>
            <p>5. Whereas his Margine demandeth, <hi>Why not a ſpirituall extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
out of a ſecular root, as well as himſelfe extracts many ſpiritual do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
out of Gamaliels Secular ſpeech?</hi> My anſwer is, that hee hath
made this demand at the perill of his owne reputation in what he
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:124227:53"/>
had ſaid but in the former page, where he ſuppoſeth, that <hi>God powred
out a ſpirit of propheſie upon Gamaliel,</hi> as hee had formerly done <hi>upon
Balaam</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> If <hi>Gamaliel</hi> ſpake as <hi>the ſpirit of propheſie</hi> which
<hi>was poured out upon him, gave him utterance,</hi> his ſpeech was not <hi>ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi>
but <hi>ſpirituall</hi> and divine. And</p>
            <p>2. Suppoſe there was no <hi>ſpirit of propheſie</hi> upon <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> when
he ſpake that <hi>ſpeech,</hi> from which <hi>I extract</hi> my <hi>Doctrines;</hi> yet the <hi>ſpeech</hi>
it ſelfe, being for the matter, tenor, and ſubſtance of it, nothing
but what is fully agreeable to the undoubted word of God elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
(which I clearly demonſtrate in the particular doctrine
handled in thoſe Sermons) it is not to be reputed <hi>Secular,</hi> though
the perſon ſpeaking it had been <hi>Secular;</hi> but <hi>Divine,</hi> becauſe the
matter of it being a truth of <hi>Divine</hi> revelation elſwhere, is <hi>Divine.</hi>
This ſaying, Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>the Sanne of God,</hi> or <hi>the holy One of God,</hi>
is not, therefore a Deviliſh ſaying, becauſe the Devill ſpake it<note n="a" place="margin">Mark. 1. 24. Luke 4. 34.</note>, but
an holy or divine ſaying or ſentence, becauſe the truth contained
in it, which is the matter of it, is from God.</p>
            <p>But 3. the perſon ſpeaking it was Eccleſiaſticall, a Doctor of the
Law, Acts 5. 34.</p>
            <p>4. And laſtly, it was about matters of the Church, and ſo Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
alſo.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Whereas in the context of the ſame margine, hee calls</hi> my
principall Argument (<hi>as he calls it) drawn from the</hi> non-juriſdiction
of the ſeven Churches of Aſia one over another, a meer Independencie, <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this for the ground or reaſon of this ſo ſevere an award, that
theſe Churches</hi> were under different civill Dominions, and not members
of the ſelfe-ſame Chriſtian Republicke; <hi>I anſwer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That why he ſhould call this my <hi>principall Argument,</hi> which
I doe not ſo much as mention, nor make any argument at all (as
leaſt in thoſe Sermons againſt which his pen riſeth up in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with ſo much indignation) I am behind hand in my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
I ſuppoſe he would willingly make that my <hi>principall
Argument,</hi> from the dint whereof he knowes how to contrive ſome
plauſible evaſion and eſcape. It was an wholſome admonition of
<hi>Auſtin</hi> long ſince,<note n="a" place="margin">Procliviores ſumus quaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re potiùs, quid contra ea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondeamus, —quae noſtro ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jiciuntur erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, quàm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendere ea quae ſunt ſalubria, ut careamus errore.</note> 
               <hi>That we are very inclinable and prone, rather to
ſeeke out how to anſwer or evade thoſe things which are brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
our error, then to minde that which is wholſome, that ſo wee may bee
free from error.</hi> But</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:124227:53"/>
2. If that be a reaſon, why <hi>the Churches in Aſia had no juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one over another,</hi> becauſe <hi>they were not members of the ſelfe-ſame
Chriſtian Republicke;</hi> then neither had the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>diviſim,</hi> and by it ſelfe, nor yet <hi>conjuncti<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> with others, any
power of <hi>juriſdiction</hi> over the Church of <hi>Antioch.</hi> For neither
were their Churches <hi>members of the ſelfe-ſame Chriſtian Republicke,</hi>
no nor yet any other Churches in the Apoſtles dayes, there being
then no <hi>Chriſtian Republick</hi> in the world.</p>
            <p>3. Neither can I well underſtand how the ſeven Churches of
<hi>Aſia</hi> ſhould be <hi>under different civill dominions,</hi> when as one and the
ſame man had power to command that <hi>all the world ſhould be taxed,
Luke</hi> 2. 1. Certain I am, that Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> doth not befriend either his
owne exception, or my underſtanding ſo farre, as to inform what
theſe <hi>different civill dominions were;</hi> or under what or whoſe domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
every or any of theſe Churches did reſpectively conſiſt. The
conſideration whereof moderately inclines me to conceive, that he
put this peece of his anſwer to the making, and affirmed it onely
<hi>de bene eſſe,</hi> that <hi>the ſeven Churches of Aſia were under different civill
dominions.</hi> Is it not much more probable, that the Churches of
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> which yet by the Aſſertors of Presbytery,
are generally and with importune confidence made confederate in
Claſſique aſſociation, were <hi>under different civill dominions?</hi> Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
1. that their Cities were two hundred miles diſtant one
from the other (a diſtance greater almoſt by an hundred miles,
then any two of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> ſtood one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as will appear preſently.) And 2. that <hi>Judea</hi> was an intire
Province by it ſelf, &amp; Luke 3. 1. is ſaid to have been under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Pontias Pilate.</hi> So that <hi>ſubjection under different civill
dominions,</hi> is not like to have been any obſtruction in the way of
thoſe <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, to impede their Presbyteriall conjunction,
had they felt the weight either of divine inſtitution, or of any
Chriſtian accommodation of their reſpective affaires, lying upon
them for the ingaging themſelves in it.</p>
            <p>4. And laſtly, ſome that ſeeme to have perfect knowledge of
thoſe parts where theſe <hi>ſeven Churches</hi> with their reſpective Cities
ſtood, affirme that ſome of them were not ſituate above twelve
miles diſtance from ſome others of them; and that the greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
between any two of them, was not above an hundred and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:124227:54"/>
twenty miles, which is not the one half of the diſtance between ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Churches in this Kingdom. So that had the Presbyteriall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
or ſubordination of Churches been an ordinance of
God, there is little queſtion to be made, but that theſe Churches
with their reſpective Angels, eſpecially under ſuch an opportunity,
would have ſubjected themſelves unto the will of God in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
and not have remained ſingle and uncombined in their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as they did.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, they were times of perſecution; wee anſwer,
So were they afterward, when (as men of the Presbyterian way
ſuppoſe) they had Presbyteries; and after that when they had E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall
government. This hath been the caſe of the Proteſtants
in <hi>France,</hi> where they now have, &amp; conſtantly have had, a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
government. So it is of the Papiſts in <hi>England,</hi> where they have
had ever ſince the Reformation, a Papall juriſdiction. And to
ſpeak to the particular, ſo was it a time of perſecution againſt the
Presbyteriall government in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, and yet it
was then exerciſed in ſeverall places of this Kingdome. See <hi>Rogers</hi>
Preface to his Analyſis of the Articles of Religion.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Whereas he ſeemes to require a reprievement for his opinion,
onely</hi> till Independents can ſhew him better grounds againſt it,<note place="margin">Sect. 64.</note> then any
yet produced; and informe him why our repreſentative Church and State
ſhould not of right enjoy and exerciſe as great or Eccleſiaſticall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
over all particular perſons and Churches, who are members of
our Church and Realm, as any Independent Miniſter or Congregation
challenge or uſurp unto themſelves over their own members, &amp;c. <hi>My an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
is,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That now I truſt he will willingly ſurrender his opinion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hand of Juſtice, and plead no further for it. Firſt, becauſe
though haply there have been <hi>no better grounds produced</hi> in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<hi>againſt it,</hi> then have been formerly in others; yet I cannot
but conceive and judge, that <hi>better</hi> arguments and <hi>grounds againſt
it,</hi> have been here <hi>produced,</hi> then Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> hath had either the
happineſſe or opportunity to meet with elſewhere; eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
partly the frequencie of his complaint, that <hi>Independents
have given little or no account of their way</hi> in writing; partly that it
is a thing hardly conſiſtent with Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> abilities, being ſweetned
with ſo much ingenuity, not to ſee and acknowledge the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencie
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:124227:54"/>
of ſuch an <hi>opinion,</hi> in whoſe condemnation ſo full a Jury
of the firſt borne principles as well of Reaſon as Religion, as hath
been here impannelled, doe conſpire. And ſecondly, becauſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
hath been given</hi> him again and again (and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in the eighth Section, page 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. of this diſcourſe) <hi>why
our whole repreſentative Church and State;</hi> (though I doe not clearly
underſtand what he meanes by <hi>our Repreſentative Church</hi> in this
place) but why the Parliament and Synod <hi>ſhould not exerciſe as
great or greater Eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction over particular perſons &amp; Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
within the Realme, &amp;c. as an Independent Miniſter</hi> AND <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi>
(for his disjunctive particle, <hi>Or,</hi> turnes him quite
out of the way of his queſtion) <hi>may exerciſe over their owne mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
But</p>
            <p>2. Whereas he ſtates the queſtion thus: Whether <hi>our Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
Church and State, may not exerciſe as great or greater Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
juriſdiction over, &amp;c. as an Independent Miniſter or Congregation
challenge or</hi> USURP <hi>unto themſelves over their own members;</hi> My
anſwer is, that doubtleſſe they may; one unrighteous or unjuſt
thing, may be as lawfully done as another every whit as unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and unjuſt as it. For Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> may pleaſe to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that <hi>Independent Miniſters and Congregations</hi> doe not <hi>uſurp</hi>
any <hi>power</hi> at all <hi>unto themſelves over their own members,</hi> that is, over
themſelves; but onely adminiſter that regular and lawfull power
over and amongſt themſelves, which every of their reſpective
members have mutually and freely given one to another, and every
particular member unto the whole body, over it ſelfe, and that as
well for its own benefit and behoofe, as for the benefit and good of
the whole body. And lawfull (queſtionleſſe) it is (yea matter of
duty) for every man to give ſuch a power of, or over himſelf, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
others, which he hath ſufficient ground either from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
or reaſon otherwiſe, to conceive and expect that it will bee
adminiſtred for his good; eſpecially having ground to conceive
yet further, that this act of his, in thus ſubmitting himſelfe unto
others, will according to the ordinary courſe of Providence and
experience, be of Chriſtian accommodation unto others alſo for
their good. <hi>Submitting your ſelves one to another in the feare of God,
Eph.</hi> 5. 21. which ſubmiſſion doubtleſſe ought ſo farre to extend, as
in reaſon it may accommodate, or promote the edification and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:124227:55"/>
ſpirituall good, both of the perſons by whom, and to whom it is
made. And by the ſame reaſon it is no <hi>uſurpation</hi> in thoſe, to whom
the ſubmiſſion is made, to adminiſter or exerciſe that power which
is committed unto them, according to the regular intentions of
thoſe who have given it: yea, ſuch an adminiſtration of it as this,
is ſo farre from being an <hi>uſurpation,</hi> that a non-adminiſtration of it
upon ſuch terms, would be a very unchriſtian prevarication both
with God and men. Therefore</p>
            <p>7. (And laſtly, to conclude) Whereas Mr. <hi>Prynne referres me to
the High Court of Parliament, either to crave their pardon, or to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
their juſtice, for my Anti-parliamentarie paſſages, &amp;c.</hi> I ſhall requeſt
no other favour of this moſt honourable Court, then that I may
ſtand right and ſtreight in their opinions, and be reſpited from
cenſure onely ſo long, till my Accuſer ſhall make good his charge
againſt me by ſufficient evidence and proofe; and ſubſtantially an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
and refute this my Apologeticall plea. When the light of this
day of darkneſſe ſhall dawne upon me, I ſhall willingly ſubmit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his demand, and either <hi>crave the Pardon of that Honourable and
High Court</hi> he ſpeaks of, or otherwiſe <hi>undergoe their juſtice:</hi> in the
meane ſeaſon I preſume he will ſubſcribe my Petition for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve,
as juſt and equall. And if the reſult of his more ſerious
thoughts ſhall be, to reſume and proſecute the bill of endictment
which he hath preferr'd againſt me; my earneſt requeſt unto him
is, as well for his own eaſe and conveniencie, as mine, 1. That he
will not argue from pluralities, but pertinences of Scriptures; and
ſhew how, and wherein every Text alledged, according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
ſenſe and rationall dependance of the words, ſtands by him
in what he intends to prove from it. And 2. that he will not place
the ſtrength and confidence of his cauſe, either in humane Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
humane practiſes, ſtatutes or ordinances of men, excepting
onely ſuch, whoſe truth, juſtice and equitie he ſhall firſt demonſtrate
either from the word of God; and that not by Texts barely cited,
chapter and verſe, though in never ſuch abundance; but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
argued, and examined upon the matter in queſtion; or els from
ſound principles of reaſon and equitie, managed in a cleare and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
way, and ſo drawne up to a faire compliance with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
ſeeking teſtimony and proofe from them. For otherwiſe,
what ſayings, doings, Lawes or Ordinances of men ſoever ſhall be
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:124227:55"/>
produc'd or inſiſted upon, for confirmation or proofe of any thing;
it will be ſufficient to Anſwer, that men as wiſe, as juſt, as vertuous
as they, have both ſaid and done, things neither true nor meet to
be done; and have made Lawes and Statutes of no better conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yea, and have been of a contrary opinion to Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> in
the particular queſtioned: which made <hi>Auguſtine</hi> often decline that
way of reaſoning, as we reade in his 48. Epiſtle, and elſewhere.
Thirdly and laſtly, that he would put leſſe vinegar and gall into
his inke, and more wooll or cotton: or (in the Apoſtles words,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 31.) that <hi>all bitterneſſe and evill ſpeaking be put away, and that
we follow the truth in love,</hi> and language that becometh Brethren.</p>
            <p>This treble requeſt I make unto him with much earneſtneſſe and
importunitie upon the ſuppoſition aforeſaid, becauſe I had much
rather yeeld, might I do it upon honourable and Chriſtian terms,
then to be put to take the field yet againe. As for any opinion held
by me, when once I perceive that it will not make knowledge, I am
ready to give the right hand of fellowſhip unto any man in caſting
it out as unſavoury ſalt upon the dunghill. I never yet thought my
ſelf (nor I hope ever ſhall) ſuch a debtor unto error, as to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
my time, paines, occaſions, credit, conſcience, upon the ſervice
of it. But unto Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> I ſhall willingly acknowledge my ſelf a
debtor, if he will either acquit me of my crime by ſilence, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
me from my error by his pen.</p>
