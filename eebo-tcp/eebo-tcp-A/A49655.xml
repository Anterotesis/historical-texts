            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </argument>
            <head type="sub">Being indeed, not only a very Pleaſant, but alſo a True Relation.</head>
            <p>IT was upon a <hi>Sunday</hi> Night (to ſanctifie the Deed) when Three Strowling Citizens, of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Note, releas'd from the <hi>Purgatory</hi> of a Compter, determin'd to gratifie their Lungs with a litlte Freſh Air and, after the Duty of the Day was over, which, no doubt they had perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the uſual City Devotion, they very amicably took a Walk together into St. <hi>Jame</hi>'s-Park.</p>
            <p>The Matrons at home, being Ladies of Singular Intelligence, were timely enough acquainted with their Husbands Determination. Mrs. <hi>A</hi>— having the firſt Advice brought to her, Poſted away with mighty Exedition to Mrs. <hi>E</hi>—'s Houſe, to acquaint her with the News, where ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſpatched a Confident to Mrs. <hi>M</hi>— who no ſooner underſtood the matter, but inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repairs to the Congreſs at Mrs. <hi>E</hi>—'s where the matter was not long a Debating, being La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of admirable Invention; and they Reſolve was, That they ſhould put on Diguiſes, and go Incognito in purſuit of their Husbands, that Care and Pleaſures ſhould ſeperately occupy the Family. The Ladies thus Equipped, purſued their Stratagem in Maſquerade, and ſoon arrived at the Park; where they were often attack'd by the Beaux and Sparks, but they, being in queſt of a nobler Game (tho' naturally coming and complying enough) did very Tyrannically repulſe all the Courtſhip and Sollicitations of theſe Gallants, and very bravely made good their way, till at length they came in view of their appointed Quarry; and drawing towards them with all the Tricks and Artifice's of Women of the Town, Mr. <hi>A</hi>— made the motion to meet them, and cary them to a Glaſs of Wine, being of an even number, and promiſing well enough to deſerve their Fare; the Motion was agreed to by the other Two, and referr'd to Mr. <hi>A</hi>— be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Man of the greateſt Aſſurance and Preſence of Mind) to manage; and accordingly, <hi>Don Formaliteſo,</hi> with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Stiffneſs, makes up to the Ladies, and accoſts them with Tropes and Figures; and a dull Harangue of Coſtive Rhetorick, (his natural Stile, wherein he excuſeth the Modeſty and Baſhfulneſs of his two Friends, tho' <hi>Gitts</hi> and Married too; yet for them and him ſelf he gave them a hearty Invitation to a <hi>Glaſs of Wine.</hi> The Ladies gave their Conſent by their Silence; or by ſaying very little at moſt, being ſparing of their Speech, for fear of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering themſelves; ſo, in ſhort, every one takes his Bird, and haſts to a certain Tavern at <hi>Gharing-Groſs</hi>; knowing the Nights being ſhort, their Wives would look for them home in good time; or elſe lead 'em a weary Life all the Week after, with hard Service in Bed, and bad Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains i'th' Shop; aſſoon as they came to the Tavern, like generous Hearts, they ſpoke for a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of a Price, and order'd it to be haſten'd with all Speed, and in the mean time call'd moſt incontinently for Wine, and drank very freely whilſt Supper was making ready: But here was the moſt diverting Scene as Fortune would have it, who ſeldom ſtumbles over, or interrupts ſuch Intriegues, each Makes choice of his own Wife, whither for Rallery, or the laſt Favours I know not, (an unhappy choice, and a ſign that they did not know them; And here they all ſtrove for the moſt ſoft and engaging Expeſſions of <hi>Love</hi>; and here they boaſted and bounced of ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Vigour, and youthful Performances, which theſe diſguiſed Ladies had too too often found experimentally falſe, in the diſconſolate and legitimate Bed; and yet, perhaps theſe Gentlemen might have been ſincere too, <hi>For ſome can never do the Trick to Perfection, but in a Bawdy Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, by this time, Supper was brought up, and the Conditions ended that they muſt now Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask, which, when the Waiters were commanded to retire, they performed, and put an end to the Farce, by diſcovering themſelves to be their Wives, and the whole Company 3 whole Pair of Legitimate Upholders of the Race Man' tho I think they had not been very ſucceſsful neither.</p>
