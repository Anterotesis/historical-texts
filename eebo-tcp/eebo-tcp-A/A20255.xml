         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>SHall ſhaking hande with drilling teares, deliuer rural verſe?</l>
               <l>my mourning Muſe doth bid me ſtaye, vnable to reherſe.</l>
               <l>The noble actes of Derby Earle, that late had breath and life:</l>
               <l>who was through Realme and forren land, beloued of man and wiſe.</l>
               <l>But ſure as teares doe caſe the heart, that plunged is in paine:</l>
               <l>and Sorrow ſhée will belch foorth ſobbes, in ſéeking reſt againe.</l>
               <l>Can countrie now at once refuſe, with dolors thus oppreſt?</l>
               <l>To ſhed foorth teares, ſith Darbye Earle, is thus now clapt in cheſt.</l>
               <l>Who though in yeres he was, more fitter for the graue,</l>
               <l>then long to liue, yet may wée ſaye, to ſoone did death depraue.</l>
               <l>This noble valiaunt Earle, of his aſpiring breath:</l>
               <l>whoſe ſage aduiſe thus loſt may be, his countries ſeconde death.</l>
               <l>Though hee in Ormeſchurch lye, incloſed now in ſlime:</l>
               <l>yet ſhall his factes inforce his fame, vp to the ſkies to clime,</l>
               <l>Though ougly Mors with ſpight, haue reft him of his life:</l>
               <l>yet ſhall his worthy déedes declare, his knowledge was full rife.</l>
               <l>That hée in ſetting ioynt and bone, as ſtanching bloodie wounde,</l>
               <l>to fewe that Chirurgery doth profeſſe, ſo much doth vnderſtande.</l>
               <l>Let Sicophantes that nolve doe ſéeke, by this his death to rayſe:</l>
               <l>yet let them knowe his worthy factes, hath merited great prayſe.</l>
               <l>No fines no time he rayſde, but Tenauntes were content:</l>
               <l>and yet ye ſhall not heare of worlde, hée greatly rayſde his rent.</l>
               <l>No toyler in the lawe, though he had profred wrong:</l>
               <l>nor yet would ſéeme to 'ppreſſe his foe, though he was mightie ſtrong.</l>
               <l>But hée by méekeneſſe made, his foe to be his friende:</l>
               <l>the wiſeſt way, all wiſemen ſaye, all quarrels ſo to ende.</l>
               <l>You nobles doe beholde, your péere doe not forget:</l>
               <l>who did not long in Marchauntes booke, delight to ſtande in det.</l>
               <l>Who knewe the Marchauntes trade, his money was his plow:</l>
               <l>and would not payment long delaye, that diſhonour ſhould not grow.</l>
               <l>Oh noble Earle of ſtature meane, but yet of manly hart:</l>
               <l>in Scotland thou, with Northfolke Duke, at Kelzey playde thy part.</l>
               <l>Of Darby Earle, as Lorde of man, and of the Garter Knight:</l>
               <l>and one that in his Princes grace, had very much delight.</l>
               <l>Both for his fayth the which, vnto hir grace he owde:</l>
               <l>and alſo for his wiſdome graue, in counſayle often ſhowed.</l>
               <l>A mind that did delight, in yelding Juſtice dewe,</l>
               <l>an eare ſtill bending downe to heare, poore Sewtors that did ſewe.</l>
               <l>A hart that rude the plight, of thoſe that were oppreſt:</l>
               <l>a knee to bende to Princely throne, to haue their cauſe redreſt.</l>
               <l>A foote that readie was, to ryde, to runne, or go:</l>
               <l>to helpe the weake that Mydas might, was like to ouerthro.</l>
               <l>An eye that ſingle was, and not with lucre ſtaind:</l>
               <l>a hande to helpe the hungrie poore, he in nowiſe refraind.</l>
               <l>How many now ſhall want, to haue wherewith to féede?</l>
               <l>their hungrie corpes which in his life, receyued reliefe at néede.</l>
               <l>What mourning make his friendes, of him that are bereft?</l>
               <l>what mourning make his yomen all, that he behinde hath left?</l>
               <l>How doth his neyghbours all, that dwell in Lancaſhire?</l>
               <l>with ſobbes and teares they doe deplore, this death of his to heare.</l>
               <l>With teares we all are forſt, this noble Earle to wayle:</l>
               <l>although that death hath brought to him, a life of greater vayle.</l>
               <l>Though Mors his corpes haue ſeaſt, that daunger none coulde daunt:</l>
               <l>yet in his ende a ſubiect true, as fame ſhall aye auaunt.</l>
               <l>No Traytor coulde him traine, at no time to rebell:</l>
               <l>nor Papiſt coulde him ought perſwade, he liked them not ſo well.</l>
               <l>To deale by their deuice, to holde with Scottiſh dame:</l>
               <l>nor Duke thats dubd, nor Percies pride, that ſought their countries bane.</l>
               <l>Though Papiſtes him extoll, and make the worlde beléeue:</l>
               <l>yet at his death he them renounſt, and to his Chriſt did cleaue.</l>
               <l>Hée knewe their traſh be ſuche on, Maſſe he did not builde.</l>
               <l>but onely calde one Jeſu Chriſt, to helpe him win the fielde.</l>
               <l>And thus hée died in Chriſt, no helpe he ſought from Pope:</l>
               <l>but in the death and bloud of Chriſt, he put his fixed hope.</l>
               <l>Though ſlowe of tongue to talke, of curious queſtions fine:</l>
               <l>yet one that read the Scriptures much, no doubt a good Deuine.</l>
               <l>He practizd that in life, that he in Scriptures founde:</l>
               <l>and ſo he built vpon the rocke, and not on ſhiueling ſonde.</l>
               <l>No bloode he brought in Maries dayes, to burne or for to broyle:</l>
               <l>nor well he likt of Spaniſh pride, that ſought this Realme to ſpoyle.</l>
               <l>Now is this Earle from Lathum gone, tourne horſe another awaye:</l>
               <l>the ſaint is fled, though ſhrine remaine, where he was woont to ſtaye.</l>
               <l>Let Lancaſhyre, and Cheſſhyre both, with teares bring Corpes to graue:</l>
               <l>For loe, his happie ſoule in heauen, the bleſſed Aungels haue.</l>
               <l>As hée in honour runne, a happie race to ende:</l>
               <l>So to his ſonne now Noble Earle, God graunt him grace to bend.</l>
               <l>To treade his Fathers trace, to ſtaye in Goſpell pure:</l>
               <l>ſo ſhall he liue in fathers fame, that euer ſhall endure.</l>
