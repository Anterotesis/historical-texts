            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Epiſtle to All Chriſtians, Jews, and Gentiles. Shewing how that <hi>GOD</hi> Dwells not in their <hi>TEMPLES</hi> made with HANDS.</head>
            <p>THus ſaith the Lord, <hi>Heaven is my Throne, and Earth is my Footſtool; Where is the Houſe that you will Build unto me, where is the Place of my Reſt?</hi> This the Lord ſaid unto the <hi>Jews</hi> that built the Temple. <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 66.1.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Heaven of Heavens cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain God, how much leſs the Houſe that he Built?</hi> 1 Kings, 8.27. And the ſame in the 2 <hi>Chronicles</hi> 6.18.</p>
            <p>And again, <hi>Steven</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Jews</hi> High-Prieſt, when he was examining him, <hi>Though</hi> Solomon <hi>Built an Houſe for the Lord, howbeit the Moſt High dwells not in Temples made with Hands; for Heaven is Gods Throne, and Earth is his Footſtool; what Houſe will ye Build Me, ſaith the Lord, or where is the Place of my Reſt? Hath not my Hands made all theſe Things? Ye Stiff-necked and Uncircumciſed in Hearts and Ears, ye do always reſiſt the Holy-Ghoſt, as your Fore-Fathers did, ſo do ye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here all may ſee, that it was the Stiff-neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Uncircumciſed Hearts and Ears, that were the Perſecutors, as in the next Verſe, that did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Holy-Ghoſt; and therefore their Bodies, in that State, were not like to be Temples of the Holy-Ghoſt: as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. And therefore theſe Perſecutors that did reſiſt the Holy-Ghoſt, which comes from the Father and the Son, were the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers up of the <hi>Outward Temple:</hi> they were not like to ſee God, as <hi>Steven did,</hi> who dwells not in <hi>Temples made with Hands</hi>; and Heaven to be his Throne, &amp; Earth his Footſtool, who reſiſteth his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from him, by which God is <hi>Seen</hi> and <hi>Known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>God that made the World, and all Things therein, ſeeing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth, dwelleth not in Temples made with Hands, neither is Worſhipped with Mens hands, as though he needed any thing, ſeeing he giveth to all, Life, and Breath, and all things, and hath made of one Blood all Nations of Men, for to dwell on the Face of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That they ſhould ſeek the Lord, if happily they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us; for in him we live, and move, and have our Being,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 17.</p>
            <p>So you may ſee here are many Witneſſes before mentioned, that God that made the World, and all things therein, who is Lord of <hi>Heaven</hi> &amp; <hi>Earth,</hi> dwelleth not in <hi>Temples</hi> made with Hands, but as the <hi>Prophets, Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſay, <hi>Heaven is Gods Throne, and Earth is his Foot-ſtool.</hi> Mat. 5.34, 35.</p>
            <p>So all come to know God, who hath made of one Blood all Nations of Men for to dwell on the <hi>Face of the Earth</hi>; he gives to you all, Life, and Breath, and all things; I ſay, all to know him by his Spirit which he poureth upon all Fleſh, <hi>Heaven</hi> to be his <hi>Throne,</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> to be his <hi>Foot-ſtool</hi>; yea, all that dwell upon the <hi>Face of the Earth,</hi> know the <hi>Earth</hi> that you dwell upon, and walk upon, to be Gods <hi>Foot-ſtool,</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> to be his <hi>Throne,</hi> who is Lord of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> who gives you Breath and Life, and poureth his Spirit upon you, or in you, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. and <hi>Acts</hi> 2. That with his Spirit you may know the Day is come that <hi>Joel</hi> ſpoke of; &amp; that with his Spirit you may all know, that God hath poured his Spirit upon you, or in you, that with it you live in God, and move in God, and have your Being in God, who is Lord of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> is his <hi>Throne,</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> is his <hi>Foot-ſtool,</hi> upon which <hi>Face of the Earth</hi> you dwell, and walk; and ſo all to ſee and know that ye are the <hi>Temples</hi> of the Living God, as God hath ſaid, <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16. and Levit. 26.12.</p>
            <p>And thus ſaith the Lord who dwells not in <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> made with Hands, but the Saints that are lead by the Holy-Ghoſt, are the Temples of God and his Holy-Ghoſt; for the Lord ſaith, <hi>The Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>&amp;</hi> Judah <hi>had provok't him to anger with the Works of their hands.</hi> The Lord ſaith, <hi>For this City</hi> (to wit) Jeruſalem, <hi>and the</hi> Temple, <hi>hath been to me a Provocation of my anger, and of my Fury, from the day that they built it, even unto this day</hi> (to wit) Jeruſalem <hi>and the</hi> Temple; <hi>that I ſhould remove it from before my Face,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and deſtroy it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.</p>
            <p>So you may ſee here, that ſuch as reſiſted the Holy-Ghoſt, were cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up <hi>Outward Jeruſalem,</hi> and the <hi>Outward Temple</hi> who were the Stiff-necked Perſecutors, and Uncircumciſed in Hearts and Ears, as you may ſee in the <hi>Prophets</hi> Time, and in <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Time, and in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, <hi>Steven</hi>'s, and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Time; and ſuch Uncircumciſed in Hearts and Ears, that are Perſecutors, that did, and do reſiſt the Holy-Ghoſt now, are crying up <hi>Outward Temples,</hi> and Impriſoning, and Perſecuting, and ſpoiling the Goods of People now, becauſe they will not give Money to mend their <hi>Temples</hi> or <hi>Churches,</hi> of ſuch as make no uſe of them, and yet they ſay, <hi>The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt their Church</hi>; and yet dayly want Repairing, either by reaſon of Weather, Storms, or Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And though the Lord tells them by his Prophet, and <hi>Steven,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles, That God that made the World, and all Things therein, dwells not in Temples made with Hands, but</hi> Heaven <hi>is his</hi> Throne, <hi>and</hi> Earth <hi>is his</hi> Foot-ſtool, <hi>and he is the Lord of</hi> Heaven <hi>and</hi> Earth. And ſaith of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in theſe words, <hi>What? know you not that your Bodies are the Temples of the Holy-Ghoſt, which is in you, which you have of God.</hi> And again, <hi>For ye are the Temples of the Living God</hi> (as God hath ſaid) <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People, and I will be a Father to you, and ye ſhall be my Sons and Daughters, ſaith God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</hi> Jer. 31.33. And therefore all that receive the Holy-Ghoſt, know your Bodies to be the <hi>Temples</hi> of the Living God, and his Holy-Ghoſt and Heaven to be Gods Throne, and Earth his Foot-ſtool, and that you dwell and walk upon his Foot-ſtool, and that you do live and move, and have your everlaſting Being in God, who dwells not in <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> made with Hands, but God dwells and walks in you his <hi>Temple,</hi> and he is your <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Father,</hi> and you are his People, and the Sons and Daughters of <hi>God Almighty.</hi> So that every one may truly ſay, <hi>I live and move and have my Being in God, and Heaven is his Throne, and Earth is his Foot-ſtool, which I naturally dwell upon and walk upon; and Spiritually in God I live and move, and have my Being to his Praiſe and Glory,</hi> Who is Lord of all, both in Heaven and Earth, from Everlaſting to Everlaſting, bleſſed and Praiſed for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.6. All People know God the Father ſo to be.</p>
