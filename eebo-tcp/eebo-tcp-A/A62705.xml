            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That he was Saymaſter to <hi>Goldſmiths Hall</hi> about

five hundred miles beyond the river <hi>Volgo,</hi> which held of
Gold in every Tun to the value of three, four, or five hundred
pounds; where this Deponent did remain until he was taken

Minerals under ground, as the ſaid Mr. <hi>Hexeter</hi> was under

inundation of water out of the vaſt and drowned Works of
<hi>Rowpits,</hi> by perſuing a Drift as a Common-ſhore, from the
Concaves of a natural ſwallow twenty fathom deep, after
his induſtrie had ſunk twenty ſhafts to diſcover the ſame, on
purpoſe to come to the rich loads of metal known to be
buried in the adjacent groves of water: This Deponent and
others, upon confidence of making good his great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings

               </gap> hancs and Decree of
their Court, to have half the profit, bearing half the charge,
after the water was drained, which this Deponent doth verily
believe will be in a ſhort time perfected, and appear for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
ſake, as well as for preſent profit, the greateſt work
that hath been done by any Mineraliſt theſe hundred years,
if the malicious attempts of ſome ill-natured perſons do not
now hinder the growth of his proceedings therein. For this
Deponent doth depoſe, that by ſome wicked perſons there
was a great Lake of muddy water turned about the hour of
midnight, and upon a great flood, into the Swallow, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
as is conceived to choak it, and ſo conſequently to drown
his men that came from forein parts, and were then work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
twenty fathom deep, which this Deponent doth aver
were forced to ſave their lives by running up their grooves
at the ſame time, the ſwallow being not able to receive the
torrent of its water. And this Deponent doth likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33234:6"/>
That about the 10. of <hi>October</hi> laſt there was ſome other
ſuch envious perſon who pulled down ſo much of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timber
of his Shaft, that the whole groove of earth fell into
Mr. <hi>Buſhels</hi> Drift, when his men were at work underneath;
and it was ſuppoſed by divers never to be recovered: But
thanks be to God, the danger is paſt, and Mr. <hi>Buſhels</hi> Drift
goeth on towards the rich works known to lie 150 fathom
before him; for this Deponent was one of the workmen
that landed <hi>100l. per</hi> week out of one Shaft this laſt ſummer,
and ſaw <hi>200l. per</hi> week out of another; but the charge of
drawing water, though in the drought of ſummer, ſtood (as
they reported) in 80 <hi>l. per</hi> week apeece, which Mr. <hi>Buſhels</hi>
Drift will prevent; and likewiſe to 1000 more of the like
nature as are ſuppoſed to be within the verge of <hi>Rowpits.</hi>

undation of waters, which (as we find expreſt in his Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance)
he doth undertake to perfect in four years; and we
do verily believe, that not only all the Oar may be then land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for two ſhillings <hi>per</hi> Tun, but that we ſhall then alſo know
the ineſtimable riches of that place without further charge

do alſo confidently believe in our conſciences, that when Mr.

works drowned, and that he doth purſue likewiſe his Croſs
Rake from his Swallow to the forebreaſt of Sir <hi>Bevis Bulmar</hi>
deſerted work, (as he ſaith he intends to do, ſo ſoon as he
hath ſecured the place according to agreement, and the
Grand Jury's Order of <hi>Chewton</hi> dated the 28. of <hi>May</hi>) the

that the forebreaſt of Sir <hi>Bevis Bulmar's</hi> work was
nine foot wide in oar; and we our ſelves know, that a hundred
pounds <hi>per</hi> week out of one Groove in the old work is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
when the ſuffocation of water doth not hinder them.</p>
