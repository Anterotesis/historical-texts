            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the reſpect I owe
you, I haue made
my ſelfe bolde, vnder your

The olde prouerbe,
which forbiddeth to ſend

taught mee not to ſend this

The two verſes before this,

As I helde it neceſſarie to
treate on this alſo, ſo I
thought it fitting to publiſh
that, which concerning it

There is no one thing (I

of diligent and reſpectiue

is pleaſed to collect &amp; gather
his, vnto himſelf. We are now
to bee informed, with what
wiſedome it becommeth vs to
behaue our ſelues in away<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16770:6"/>
Hearing is a very neceſſarie
and an important dutie: and
yet, a man through his owne
default may be conſtant and
continuall in it to his hurt, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to his benefit. To
the end therefore wee may ſo
attend vpon this exerciſe of
Prophecying, as that thereby
wee may be edified in our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
faith, <hi>Paul</hi> commendeth
here vnto vs, two neceſſarie
vertues:<note place="margin">The diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</note> 1 Diſcretion: 2 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.
Diſcretion, to try all
things. Conſtancy, to holde
faſt that, which is found vpon
tryall to be good. To retaine
ought in Religion ſtifly, before
a man haue tryed it thorowly,
what greater folly? This is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16770:7"/>
wilfulneſſe rather and Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,
then true Conſtancy.
Againe; to examine points
diligently, and then to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
them careleſly, what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vanity? It is a great deale
of labour to no vſe. But to
ſift and ſcanne that which is
heard, exactly, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that which is found to
holde at the touch reſolutely,
this is the glory and credit of
Chriſtianity. Of theſe two
points I am now in order to
intreat.</p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt,<note place="margin">The firſt Doctrine.</note> this is
the Doctrine; That it is the
dutie of thoſe which honour
preaching as the meanes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for ſaluation, To try
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16770:7"/>
things taught, before they
giue their full and abſolute
yeelding thereunto: Who
that lookes vpon the place,
but hee will foorthwith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
this to bee the doctrine?
The aduice of the ſpirite of
God is, that our honouring
of prophecying, ſhould bee
accompanied with trying it.
So reſpect it, as that you bind
not your ſelues to a receiuing
without enquirie, hand ouer
head, whatſoeuer is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by it. Heereto is that
charge to be referred, of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſpirits<note n="a" place="margin">1 Iohn 4. 1</note>, that is, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
their perſons &amp; doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines,
who profeſſe to ſpeake
vnto vs by the Spirit. It remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16770:8"/>
vpon record, as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the Nobles of Berea,
and it is a rule for vs, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> preach
they were diligent in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whether the things they
ſpake were ſo<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 17. 11</note>.</p>
            <p>The courſe of ſeeking holy
knowledge, at the mouthes of
thoſe, whoſe lippes by their
calling ought to preſerue it<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 2. 7</note>,
is tearmed by <hi>Salomon,</hi> a buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Truth<note n="d" place="margin">Pr. 23. 23</note>. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in buying, it is euery
mans wiſedome to conſider
the wares which are tendered
to him,<note place="margin">Gyrare ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiatorem vnum &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum.</note> how they are conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
and (as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith
pithily to this purpoſe) to go
from ſhop to ſhop,<note place="margin">Chry. Hom. 44. in opere imperfect.</note> and from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16770:8"/>
chapman to chapman, to look
where hee may haue the beſt,
before hee make a through
bargaine: ſo it ought to bee
the care of a prudent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
to conſider of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
which are taught, before
he giue them entertainement.
Take heede how you heare,
ſaid our Sauiour<note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 8. 18.</note>; Doth not
this Take heed in hearing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a tryall of things heard?
Conſider two things with me;
and the truth, equitie, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie
of this doctrine will
ſoone bee yeelded to. The
one is the poſsibilitie of bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deceiued in our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
vpon prophecying.
The other is, the danger of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16770:9"/>
miſtaking. The poſsibility of
beeing deceiued, proceeds
from two things: 1 Somewhat
in them which prophecy: 2.
Somewhat in our ſelues, who
liſten thereunto. Touching
them which prophecy, there
are two ſorts by whom there
is danger of deceit. 1 Some
purpoſe to deceiue: 2 Some
caſually may deceiue. Some
purpoſe to deceiue, whom the
Apoſtle tearmeth, liers in

vnſauorie, ſometimes things
vain &amp; fooliſh, as the Scripture
tearmeth them<note n="s" place="margin">Lam. 2. 14</note> ordinarily,
ſuch as God neuer comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

Theſe be ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> calleth
Deceiued deceiuers<note n="y" place="margin">2 Tim. 3 13</note>. They

ſo beguile others. I will not
be ſo vncharitable as to range
ſuch among purpoſed decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers:
yet this I ſay, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
beeing through vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulneſſe
and negligence
miſtaken, &amp; doing the Lords
worke more remiſly then is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16770:11"/>
fit, they become an occaſion
of erring vnto others. When
men come to the handling of
holy things, not well inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themſelues, and then doe
that which they doe, without
any great conſcience (it may
be they doe it for forme, and
binde themſelues to ſpeak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Times) it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee auoided (though it
may be, their hearts are not
ſo nought as to meane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit)
but ſometimes others by
them ſhall be in danger to be
miſled. The ſecond ſort of
ſuch as caſually may deceiue,
are euen the beſt, the moſt
ſufficient &amp; faithful Teachers.
It is poſsible, that euen ſuch,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16770:11"/>
notwithſtanding all their care,
may at a time deliuer that
which is not ſafe to entertain.
None ſince Chriſt, neither
companies of men, nor parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
perſons, haue had the
infallible aſsiſtance of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt, except the Apoſtles.
Our knowledge here is but in
part<note n="z" place="margin">1 cor. 13. 9</note>. In ſundry things (as
men) wee are many times
much miſtaken. And it falleth
out many times, thorough
Gods wiſe diſpenſing, that
ſomewhat is reuealed to him
which ſitteth by, which hee
who occupieth the roome of
the Teacher, doth not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand;
as is gatherable out of
that ſaying of the Apoſtle,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16770:12"/>
(1 Cor. 14. 30.) This is the
firſt thing out of which there
ſprings a poſsibility of being
deceiued. The ſecond, is from
out of our ſelues which come
to heare. We are naturally in
matters of Religion eaſily miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caried,
by reaſon of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of minde, and darkneſs
of cogitation, which we haue
brought with vs from the
Wombe<note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 4. 18</note>: wee are vnwiſe by
nature and deceiued<note n="b" place="margin">1 Tit. 3. 3</note>. And
then what through preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
truſting too much to our
ſelues, what through a kinde
of natiue lothneſſe to endure
the paynes of Trying, what
through an affectation of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelty,
we are very lyable to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16770:12"/>
deceit, apt to drinke-in error
as water, and to bee carried
vp &amp; downe with euery wind
of doctrine<note n="c" place="margin">Eph. 4. 14</note>. As it is ſaid of
vs in the generall, that we are
clay to God, and wax to the
diuell: ſo may it bee applyed
to vs in the particular, that we
are hardly wrought to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement
of a truth, but
ſoone wonne to the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of an error. The Iewes
in regarde of their vntoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to good, were tearmed
ſtiffe-necked<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 7. 51</note>, and a gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying
people<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 10 21</note>, and yet ſoone
turned out of the way which
God commanded them<note n="f" place="margin">Ex. 32. 8</note>; and
the Galatians were ſoone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued
to another Goſpell<note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 1. 8</note>,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16770:13"/>
and yet the paynes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Chriſt in them was as a
trauailing in birth<note n="h" place="margin">Gal. 4. 19</note>. Euer
ſince the razing out of vs the
image of the God of truth,
there hath been in our nature
ſuch an affinitie with falſhood,
that that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the
deceiueableneſs of vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
<note n="i" place="margin">2 Theſ. 2 10.</note>, is very preuailing,
ſpeedily to entangle vs. That
ſame canker or gangreane of
vntruth doth ſoone ſeize vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vs, and it fretteth<note n="k" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 17</note> apace
when it hath once begunne.
Hereupon, the bringers in of
hereſies haue many to follow
their damnable wayes<note n="l" place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 2</note>: and
Antichriſt hath ſmall &amp; great,
rich and poore, to receiue his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16770:13"/>
marke<note n="m" place="margin">Apoc. 13 16</note>. Now for the danger
of erring in matters of this
kinde, it is not hard to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
it. Religion is a matter
which concernes the ſoule,
and the euerlaſting happineſs
thereof. A miſtaking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
muſt needs be followed,
with a more then ordinarie
hurt. I know there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
and degrees of errors
in matters of Religion. Some
do ſtrike more directly to the
heart of piety, and weaken
the very maine foundation of
faith. Some are not altogether
of ſo da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous a nature; being
in points of leſſe importance.
The former are as mortall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
in the body: the other
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16770:14"/>
are but as ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
within, or ſwelling tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
without. But yet as in
the bodie, ſmaller griefes,
when they are multiplyed and
continued, become preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
to the life of the whole:
ſo theſe inferiour kindes of
miſtakings, when they are
ordinarie &amp; encreaſed, grow
dangerous, to the Maine. A
little leauen doth leauen the
whole lumpe<note n="n" place="margin">Gal. 5. 9</note>: It is applyed
by the Apoſtle, to ſhew what
inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience followes the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of (as it may ſeem)
a pettie error in the things of
God. The withall in the day
of tentation, when a man is
either before the world called
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16770:14"/>
into queſtion for that which
he doth profeſſe, or elſe is ſif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and winnowed by Satan,
about that which he beleeues;
how woefull and hazardous
ſhall his caſe be, if hee haue
taken vp his religion onely
(as I may ſo ſpeake) vpon
truſt, or rayſed it vp out of
his owne ſurmiſe! There is
neither of theſe, but will bee
a poore ground for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
vpon, in the time of Triall.
Small courage ſhall one haue,
to engage his life for that, for
which his beſt proofe is the
authority of him from whom
he receiued it: and it will
not be eaſie to anſwer the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
by alleadging the name
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16770:15"/>
of a man, vnleſſe he be able to
iuſtifie his Tenent by diuine
authoritie. So then, if either we
conſider the eaſineſſe of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in matters of Religion,
or the perill of miſtaking ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
we muſt needes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
this doctrine, touching
the Triall of doctrines, to be
true. How ſhall this eaſineſs
to erre bee preuented? how
ſhall this danger of not going
aright be auoided? but by this
one courſe of conſidering all
things, and of examining each
point, before wee build vpon
it as a certaintie.</p>
            <p>The diuell labours to poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the fountain of Truth (the
publicke Miniſtrie) ſo that oft
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16770:15"/>
times there ſtreame euen
from it very dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits:<note place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>
and the olde ſaying
may bee well applyed to our
profeſsion, Many good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
but few good plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
So, many aduenturers to
ſpeake from the pulpit; not
ſo many who obſerue the rule,
of ſpeaking as the words of
God<note n="o" place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 11</note>, and then the beſt ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
are ouerſhot. I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber
what we learned when we were
boyes;<note place="margin">Cicero Offi. lib. 3</note> How one <hi>Cannius</hi> was
cozened in the buying of a
garden in an Iland. The ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
firſt inuited him to it, and
for that day hired diuers fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhermen,
to attend the banks
with boates and nets, and to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16770:16"/>
bring in plenty of fiſh, and to
lay it at his feet, making <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
beleeue (who wondered
at it) that it was the royalty of
the place, and that that ſeruice
was due to him, as Lord of the
garden, whenſoeuer he came
thither. <hi>Cannius</hi> beleeuing
him, and being much in loue
with ſuch a commodity, would
needes haue the garden, and
paid for it to the purpoſe.
Shortly after, he had a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to let ſome of his friends
ſee what a purchaſe hee had
made, and brought them
to the garden to bee merry,
making full account that the
fiſhermen would bee there,
both to ſhew him paſtime, &amp;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16770:16"/>
to preſent him with a tribute
of fiſh. When hee ſaw neither
boate, nor fiſherman, nor net,
hee asked his neighbours whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it where holy-day with
fiſhermen: They anſwered
none that they knew of; and
added withall, that they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at the late reſorte of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhermen
there, as a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vſuall
in that place. Vpon this,
<hi>Cannius</hi> perceiued hee was
cozened: but it was too late; he
could not helpe it. And thus
may an heedleſs perſon be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
in his dependance vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Gods ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: He may meet
with ſome crafty <hi>Pythius</hi> (for
ſo was hee called who decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<hi>Cannius)</hi> who may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16770:17"/>
a doctrine to him, and
ſet it out with many plauſible
tearmes, as if it were of ſuch
and ſuch excellent vſe for a
mans ſoule; which yet, when
it is brought to triall ſhall be
found to yeelde out no ſuch
matter as was promiſed. Thus
ſtill may this point be ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
touching the poſsibilitie
to receiue infection, euen by
preaching: to which when we
ſhall ioyne our owne aptneſſe
to be miſled, and the perill
of going awry, the generall
point muſt needes bee yelded
to; namely, that in receiuing
of doctrines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Trying ought to
goe before Truſting; we muſt
labour to bee ſure that which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16770:17"/>
we intend to keepe is good,
before wee ſet vpon the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of it as good.</p>
            <p>This point of doctrine,<note place="margin">The vſe.</note>
makes to the diſcouerie (I
wiſh alſo it may ſo pleaſe God,
to the recouerie) of three
great euils, which are very
preuailing, and very vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
in theſe our Times. 1 Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.
2 Careleſneſs. 3 Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulneſſe.
The firſt of theſe
is a froward humour. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
a negligent humor. The
third, a ſottiſh humour. They
are ouercomne with the firſt,
who plead for their excuſe, in
either not hearing, or not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting
any whom they heare;
the variety of opinions to bee
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16770:18"/>
found among preachers, and
the poſsibility of beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by dependance on
them; ſcarcely two of them
of a minde (ſay ſome) and
therefore my reſolution is, I
will beleeue none. How doth
this agree with the Rule of
Trying all things? It is not the
counſell of the holy Ghoſt,
becauſe there is a ſpirit of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in the mouthes of many,
and the beſt learned may miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
therefore ceaſe to hear;
but becauſe it is thus, be ſure
to try. This bindes to iudiciall
hearing, it giues no warrant
to deſiſt from hearing. Wilt
thou rather ſtarue, becauſe of
a poſsibility to bee poyſoned?
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16770:18"/>
or goe naked and neere the
winde, becauſe in the ſhops
of them that ſell, thou mayſt
be cozened? or lie downe in
the ſtreete, or by the hedge,
becauſe (perhaps) thou maiſt
either goe wrong, or ſtumble
on the way? Our Sauiour
would haue his Diſciples learn
and inquire, and ſeeke to
bee ſure what he was, though
ſome ſaide one thing, ſome
another, touching him<note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 16 13. 15</note>.
That I may bee deceiued,
muſt encreaſe my care, not
ouerthrow my diligence.</p>
            <p>Now touching the ſecond
euill, of careleſſeneſſe, it is to
be ſeene in thoſe, who are apt
to take all for ſound &amp; good,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16770:19"/>
which is deliuered. If they can
countenance that which they
ſeeme to maintaine, with the
name of a Teacher, or ſay, it
was deliuered at a Sermon,
they thinke it is enough. Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
there is euen a kinde
of Idolatry committed by
ſome, in ſelling themſelues ſo
to ſome mens iudgements,
that they doe in a manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
euery word an Oracle
which they ſpeake. It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for them, if ſuch or ſuch
a man hath ſaid it. This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
a ſpice of that which Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> tearmes a being ſeruants
to men,<note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor. 7 23.</note>. It is to haue ones
faith more in the wiſedome of
man, then in the power of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16770:19"/>
God<note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 5</note>. Let a man eſteme of
vs, as the miniſters of God<note n="s" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 1</note>,
but yet, not as men in whom,
but by whom, you belieue<note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 5</note>.
Were he an Angel from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
yet his Goſpel muſt bee
looked into<note n="u" place="margin">Gal. 1. 8</note>. Hearken to a
matter becauſe wee ſay it; ſo
much wee may chalenge by
our place: but doe not belieue
it, vntill you knowe vpon
what ground wee haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it. Could wee once
work a conſcience of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in our hearers, many who
doe now deſpiſe our doctrine,
would then approoue it; and
they which doe approoue it,
would finde ten times more
ſweetneſſe in it then they doe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:16770:20"/>
But now commeth the
third euill, at the leaſt as bad
as the two former, and that is
vnskilfulneſſe. This reacheth
farre. For, beſides, that they
who are guilty of the two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
named, are alſo charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with this; euen they who
are better diſpoſed, and haue
a kinde of inclination to the
dutie of Triall, yet want that
skill, and ableneſſe for it,
which is neceſſarie. It is not
eaſie, no not among the beſt
profeſſors, to finde a man that
hath an exerciſed wit, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
both good and euill<note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 5. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>.
A witty and ingenious man,
well ſpoken, and able to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a matter handſomely, &amp; to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16770:20"/>
ſet it out with a ſmooth and
pleaſing phraſe, would ſoone
deceiue euen a great many of
thoſe which meane well.</p>
            <p>Quickly might a man of
Arts and Parts, make many of
vs to ſtagger, euen touching
thoſe very things which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
haue gone with vs for
currant, and wherein we haue
ſeemed very confident. A
man might ſo lap vp the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous
drugs of Poperie, and
ſo gild them ouer with the
ſeeming allowance of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
&amp; of hore-headed Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
that euen the greateſt
part would ſoone ſwallow
them downe without ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This is a truth, but a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16770:21"/>
truth. What pittie is
it, that after this long Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
of the Goſpel in this
Land, there ſhould be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
who but (as Saint <hi>Peters</hi>

in matters of Religion; and
like <hi>Zebut</hi> in the holy ſtorie,
either take men to be but the

to be men<note n="z" place="margin">Iud. 9. 36</note>. They know not

and were ready to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

            <p>Now happie might I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

God would neuer bid vs Try,
if it were not poſsible for vs to
be able to Try. Now all Triall
of doctrine muſt bee by ſome
Rule. The Greeke word here
tranſlated Try, betokens, ſuch
a triall as Gold-ſmiths vſe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

whereof they haue a touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,

not hold, is reiected and laide

there muſt be ſought, for

haue found it, we muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
how to make vſe of it, to
that end. The maine Touch by
which all doctrine muſt be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and by which it muſt either
ſtand or fall, is the will of God
reuealed in the Scriptures.

            <p>Thus haue wee found the
touchſtone: let vs now enquire
how it muſt bee vſed. A little
childe, or a foole may eaſily
finde a touchſtone, and yet
when he hath it, not know what
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16770:26"/>
to doe with it, more then with
an other ordinarie pibble.
Though the Scripture bee not
ſo common as it ſhould, yet
it is conuerſed with by more,
then can tell how to turn it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
good. This then ſhall be the
next parte of my taske, to ſhew
how the Scripture may bee
made vſe of, for the Tryall of
doctrines.</p>
            <p>And heere there are two
things conſiderable. 1 How he
muſt be qualified, who aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureth
to meddle with the
Scripture. 2 How beeing ſo
qualified as is neceſſarie, hee
may be able to apply it to this
vſe. Firſt, whoſo puts his hand
to the Scripture in deſire to get
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16770:27"/>
skill by it, ſo, as that by the
helpe thereof he may be able
to examine doctrines, it is meet
eſpecially that hee be a man of
an humble ſpirit. They bee
the humble, to whom the Lord
giueth grace<note n="q" place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 5</note>, hee dwelleth
with ſuch<note n="r" place="margin">Iſa. 57. 15</note>, hee teacheth his
way to ſuch, to them he reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
his ſecrets<note n="s" place="margin">Pſal. 25. 9 14</note>: a man muſt
humble himſelfe, that hee may
walke with his God<note n="t" place="margin">Mic. 6. 8 Modò ad hautiendum accedat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotè. Aug. de vtilitate credendi. c. 6</note>. It is a
good ſpeech of <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> The
doctrine of the Scripture is ſo
tempered, that there is no man
but may draw thence ſufficient
for himſelfe, prouided that he
come vnto it with Deuotion.
Now, that which the Scripture
meaneth by humblenes of ſpirit
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16770:27"/>
in this caſe, and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> by
Deuotion, is this; A yeelding
of a mans ſelfe ouer to bee
taught of God, out of a reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and ſtrong opinion, that
he is of himſelfe but a foole
in the things of God. This
is that which the Apoſtle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
a beeing a foole, to the
end that he may be wiſe<note n="u" place="margin">1 Cor. 3 18</note>. They
be the ſimple, to whom the
word of the Lord giues ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of wit<note n="x" place="margin">Pro. 1. 4</note>. The ſumme is
this in a word (that I may not
dwel vpon this particular); Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a man be ſenſible in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
of mans natiue dulneſſe
in the matters of God, of the
vnfitneſs of his reaſon to iudge
and to determine in points of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16770:28"/>
that nature, and ſo reſolue to
ſubmit himſelfe wholly to be
taught of God, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
himſelfe and to ſubdue
his thoughts, and to frame
them to that which hee ſhall
reueale, it is vnpoſsible that he
ſhould euer, be by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
made wiſe vnto ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Now the beſt euidence of
ones being furniſhed with this
worthy quality, is his binding
himſelfe not to looke into the
Scripture without praier. Thus
did <hi>Dauid</hi> bewray the meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his ſpirit, by begging
of God to open his eyes, to
ſee the wonders of the Law<note n="y" place="margin">Pſ. 119. 18</note>,
by praying him to giue him
vnderſtanding<note n="z" place="margin">Pſ. 119. 34</note>, to teach him
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16770:28"/>
good iudgement and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<note n="a" place="margin">Pſ. 119. 66</note>. This ſhewed <hi>Dauid</hi>
to haue renounced all opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his owne ſufficiency,
and to haue reſigned himſelfe
ouer wholly to the Lords gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
Hee would not truſt
himſelfe in wading into theſe
depthes: but in more then a
iealouſie ouer himſelfe, hee
caſt himſelfe altogether vpon
God. It is but as <hi>Paul</hi> calleth
it, vaine iangling<note n="b" place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 6</note>, and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
falſely ſo called<note n="c" place="margin">1 Tim. 6 20</note>, a kind
of frothie knowledge, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
men get out of the
Scripture, aduenturing on it,
without this quality. Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
if thou wouldeſt get
ought out of Gods booke, by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16770:29"/>
which thy ſoule may bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
as with marow and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
neuer to betake thy ſelfe
to the vſe of it, but to vrge
that vpon thy ſelfe, which the
woman of Samaria, ſcoffing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid to Chriſt, Thou haſt
nothing to draw with, and the
well is deepe<note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 4, 11</note>, without thee

               </note> I ſhall depart empty

            <p>Now when a man is thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
and prepared with an
humble, yeelding, and reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſpirit, his next care muſt
be, to be furniſhed out of the
Scripture with ſome matter of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16770:29"/>
Rule, by which hee may ſtill
in his hearing courſe, make
that tryall which is neceſſarie.
This matter of Rule, I may
thus diſtinguiſh; It is either
more generall, or more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and particular. The more
generall matter of Rule, is the
doctrine of Catechiſme. I will
ſhew you what I meane here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
There is a thing, which
<hi>Paul</hi> in one place calleth the
Forme of doctrine<note n="e" place="margin">

                  </gap>. 2 Tim. 1. 13</note>; elſe where, The
doctrine of the beginning of
Chriſt<note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 6. 1</note>. It is a certaine frame
of ſacred Truth, rayſed out
of plaine, direct, and vnque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiond
Texts of holy Scripture,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16770:30"/>
manifeſting by the way of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement,
the order and
courſe of mans ſaluation, to
whom he muſt looke vp for
it, and by what way &amp; meanes
he muſt come to it. He which
doth not beginne at this, ſhall
neuer come vnto that in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which is called the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<note n="h" place="margin">Luk. 1. 4</note>. There was a courſe
of teaching this in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
dayes, as may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of Heb 6. 1. and hath
beene continued in all well
gouerned Churches euer ſince.
And I am verely perſwaded,
that one ſpeciall reaſon, why
both many, who are for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion
Diuines, are ſtaggering
and vncertaine, and various in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:16770:30"/>
pointes of diuinity, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to drawing this way, and
that way, either by the Times,
or by ſuch Authors as they
meete with; and diuers alſo of
our people, of all rankes are
ſo vnſettled, and ſo by and by
puzled, vpon the raiſing vp
of a new or ſtrange point of
doctrine, is, they were neuer
well broght vp in the grounds
of Chatechiſme. And it is a
great errour both amongſt vs
Miniſters, that this kinde of
Teaching is ſo little in our
practice; &amp; amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that where it is vſed it is
ſo little in eſteem. Neuer ſhall
a man bee other then raw in
Religion, that was not well
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:16770:31"/>
ſeaſoned with the firſt rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Theſe muſt be to him
like the patternes which ſome
craftſmen haue, by which they
proportion out their worke:
That which they heare, if it
hold not agreement with theſe
principles, it muſt be reiected
as vnſound. Theſe our daies
afford many helpes in this
kinde, and our neglect herein
is the more without excuſe. If
you ſhall giue this point, but a
little time and roome in your
thoughts to bee here conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of, I make no doubt, but
you will all confeſſe it to bee
true.</p>
            <p>Now the more ſpeciall and
particular Rule, is either for
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:16770:31"/>
the deciding of the great
queſtion betwixt vs and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
or for our direction and
ſettlement in that ordinarie
preaching which is amongſt
our ſelues. Touching Popery,
wee ſhall finde that courſe
which <hi>Salomon</hi> tooke for the
trying of the two Harlots
which came before him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was the true mother, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
both were therein very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<note n="i" place="margin">1 King. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>, to be of very ſpecial vſe
for the triall thereof, and for
the confirming of a mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
touching it, that it
is but counterfeit. Shee who
could bee content the liuing
childe ſhould be diuided, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
gaue his verdit vpon
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16770:32"/>
her, that ſurely ſhee was not
the mother. Vnity is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
much boaſted of by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
yet there is nothing ſo
pregnant againſt them as this
point of diuiſion. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
God will haue all reſerued
to himſelfe, and will admit no
copartinarie (I will not giue
my glory to another<note n="k" place="margin">Iſa. 42. 8</note>,) we ſhal
finde Poperie in the points of
Chriſtian religion, to admit
(clean co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
lawes of heauen) as it were
a Gauel-kinde cuſtome, and
to allow ſhares with God, in
the things wherein hee will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
no partners; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:
Adoration is diuided
betwixt God &amp; Images. The
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16770:32"/>
ſeruice of prayer betwixt God
and creatures. Mediation to
the diuine Maieſty, betwixt
Chriſt and Saints. The head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> betwixt
Chriſt &amp; the Pope. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion
of a Sinner, betwixt
the freedome of Gods grace,
and the freedome of mans
will. Iuſtification, betwixt faith
and workes. The ground of
a Chriſtian mans faith, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Scriptures and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Abſolute obedience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the precepts of the
Church. And ſo in other
things, for I giue you but a
taſte. Take we this for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Rule, by which to iudge
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16770:33"/>
of the doctrine of Popery. It
is content like the pretended
mother to diuide thoſe things
betwixt two, or moe, which
ought of right to bee reſerued
vnto one. I dare vndertake,
that in the maine points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
there is a making o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
more or leſſe, from God
to ſomewhat elſe, all that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
that reſpect, that depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
vpon, that reuerence,
that acknowledgement, which
by vertue of the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
is his peculiar. I
would faine ſee, how the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of the Church of Rome
can bee freed from diſperſing
thoſe affections and powers
of the heart vnto ſundry par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16770:33"/>
which the Lord requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to be giuen wholly vnto
him. Let the matter bee tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
examined: and if the
ſeuerall points of that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which wee profeſſe and
preach in the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
at this day, bee not like
the lines in a Circumference,
which al meet in this one Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Gods glory, and of that
maine ayme of God in all his
proceedings, He that reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth,
let him reioyce in the
Lord<note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 31</note>, we may freely allowe
you to diſclaime it. Wee will
neuer feare to ioyne iſſue with
Papiſts in this: wee will neuer
decline, nay we will entreat &amp;
ſue for this Triall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:16770:34"/>
Now for direction in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
vpon our ordinarie
preaching, I commend this eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
to the obſeruation &amp;
vſe of common men. For I
now labour not ſo much to
giue precepts for thoſe that
be learned, and haue helps by
Arts and Tongues &amp; reading,
to ſcan the things which are
preſented to them: but I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour
to guide thoſe, who
haue no more for their ayde
in this ſeruice, then common
education hath afforded them.
I remember a ſaying of <hi>Pauls,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 15</note>
Iudge you (ſaid he) what I ſay.
Me thinks I may thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that there is ſomewhat
within the ſoule &amp; conſcience
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16770:34"/>
of the hearer, by which hee
muſt determine touching that
which commeth to him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it bee meet to giue it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement,
yea or no. There
is a certaine hid man of the
heart<note n="n" place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 4</note>, which muſt bee iudge
in this caſe. Thou muſt try that
which thou heareſt, by the
work which it hath vpon thy
ſoule. There be three ſpeciall
things which I may tearme the
aime of the whole Scripture.
That doctrine w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> tends to the
furtherance of all, or either of
theſe three, a man may ſafely
build vpon it, that it is true:
That which is a let or an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
to any of theſe three,
it muſt be reiected as vnſound.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16770:35"/>
The three things, are, 1 Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.
2 Comfort. 3 Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of obedience. The whole
Scripture driues to theſe three:
1 To abaſe man in his owne
eyes, &amp; to lay him in the duſt.
2 To refreſh his ſoule, and to
bring his bones w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> haue bin
broken, to reioyce. 3 To frame
his heart to a conſtant deſire &amp;
care of pleaſing God. Theſe
be three things ſimply neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
to the compoſition of a
right Chriſtian. Hereupon the
Scripture is ſo exact in laying
open the corruption of mans
naturall eſtate, in ſetting out
the foulneſſe, and haynouſnes
of ſinne, in deſcribing the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of Gods iuſtice, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:16770:35"/>
the terror of that which
is the beſt of mans deſert. Here
upon (ſecondly) it is, that it ſo
gratiouſly diſcouereth the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of Chriſt, the fulneſſe of
the grace which is in him, the
riches of Gods mercy through
him, euery way anſwering a
mans ſpiritual neceſsity. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
(thirdly) it is, that it ſo
preciſely &amp; ſtraightly preſſeth
the duties of holineſs, giuing
no manner of liberty to mans
owne naturall inclination, but
binding him to a finiſhing his
ſaluation with fear &amp; tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling,
and to a cauſing his heart to be
in the feare of God continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Marke thou this then: Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
thine owne ſoule how
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:16770:36"/>
that which thou heareſt hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
thee onwards in either of
theſe three; how it beats down
the naturall pride &amp; preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thy heart, ſtriuing to
make thee vile in thine owne
eyes; how it acquaints thee
with the Fulneſs of Chriſt, and
directs the for the ſettling of
thine abaſed &amp; trembling ſoule
vpon him; how it hedgeth thee
in, in thoſe exceſſes thou art
inclinable to; how it limits and
ſtints thee in the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thou wouldeſt faine haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
how it tieth thee vp, and
vrgeth thee to a kinde of ſtrict
and circumſpect walking. If
thou finde it thus to work, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it, reſt vpon it, lay it vp,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16770:36"/>
hide it in the midſt of thy heart,
it ſhall be health to thy nauill,
and marowe to thy bones. If
thou heareſt a doctrine taught,
which thou findeſt to extenuate
the corruption of mans nature,
or to darken and obſcure
that aboundant mercy which
is in Chriſt, weakning that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
which an afflicted ſoule
deſireth by him, or to hearten
the euill inclination of the hart,
and to giue ſome liberty to the
fleſh, and to ſeeme to make
ſome of thoſe courſes tolerable
which thou (as a man) art rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to affect; beware thereof, as
of poyſon to thy ſoule. It is
not that truth which thou muſt
hearken to. I haue ſet you
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16770:37"/>
downe a Rule, which if you
pleaſe to obſerue and practice
you ſhall finde to be exceeding
vſefull. That which thou hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
if thou perceiue that it
humbleth and checketh thee in
thy ſecurity, comforts thee in
thy perplexity, curbs thee in,
in thy deſired liberty, thou
maiſt be bolde to ſay, It is the
Truth of God. All the falſhood
which in theſe dayes generally
we are in danger of, faileth in
one of theſe 3 particulars. If I
ſhall ſhew you an experiment
of this Rule, it wil be the better
vnderſtood, &amp; the better credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
I pray be pleaſed to ioyne
a little with me in the trying of
the doctrine w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> my ſelfe haue
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16770:37"/>
here taught in my former Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
vpon the precedent verſe
and vpon this, thus farre. I
taught in that, the neceſsity of
dependance vpon preaching,
if we would be ſaued: I vrged
the ſeeking to enioy this means,
eſpecially on the Sabbath day,
though it were with ſom charge
or hazard. I haue perſwaded
(in this) diligence to Try the
doctrins w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are taught, &amp; care
to be furniſhed with skill to that
end. Now it may bee, all are
not in theſe particulars of the
ſame opinion; perhaps, you
may heare that taught ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
which is ſomewhat diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:
as, that other meanes
may ſerue without preaching,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16770:38"/>
that there needeth not be ſuch
labouring and ſeeking after it,
now and then may ſuffice; and
that it is not for ordinarie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
to ſeeke to be ſo skilfull
and buſie, as to fall to the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
of doctrines. It may be
(I ſay) ſuch things as theſe may
bee deliuered plauſibly, and
with ſome ſhew of truth. To
reſolue vs therefore herein, let
vs make vſe of our Rule: you
ſhall finde that this doctrine
which ſo preſſeth an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
vpon preaching, makes
moſt for mans humbling, moſt
for his comfort, moſt for his
reſtraint. 1 Moſt for his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.
For what can put a man
downe more then the binding
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16770:38"/>
of him (whatſoeuer he be, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
wiſe, learned, and howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
elſe outwardly qualified)
to ſit him downe as a diſciple
in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>rners forme? He ſhall
not think to worke out a path
to heauen by his owne indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry:
but he muſt ſeeke ſauing
knowledge at the mouth of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and goe as hee is led
by anothers hand. This cuts
the very heart of mans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
pride, according as indeed
it is onely out of the hautineſſe
of their ſpirits, and their loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to ſtoope, and the good
opinion of their owne ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
which maketh a great
many to gainſay this doctrine.
What is the reaſon that <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:16770:39"/>
of old called it the fooliſhnes of
preaching<note n="x" place="margin">1 Cor. 1 21</note>? but becauſe men
in their ſeeming wiſdome ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it, and eſteemed it for lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better then euen a very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
and childiſh courſe.
Oh, if man by ſome courſe of
his owne inuenting, might be
permitted to ſeek out heauen,
it would pleaſe him a great
deale better: but, to require him
to giue attendance vpon a
Teacher, to ſit at the foot of a
poore Miniſter, and to heare
what he ſhall ſay, and to ſuffer
him to controule and checke
him in his courſes, and with
meekenes and ſilence yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
with thankfulnes to endure
it, what a very death is this?
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16770:39"/>
what a baſe thing in the eyes
of fleſh and blood? you ſee
plainely this makes moſt for
a mans humbling: I am much
deceiued, if it doe not alſo
make moſt for his comfort.
Firſt, this I am ſure, that the
myſtery of Chriſt (the ground
of comfort) can neuer ſo work
vpon a mans affections any
way, as when it is effectually
diſcouered by a liuely voyce.
There is a certaine efficacy in
the voyce of man to put life
into the inward parts.<note place="margin">Habet neſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio quid la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergiae viua vox. Hier.</note> But this
is not all: Here is the chiefe;
A mans comfort in Chriſt is
then ſuch as he may haue beſt
aſſurance of, when hee
can ſay, hee hath not therein
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16770:40"/>
beene his owne caruer, but
the ſame hath beene applyed
to him by the hand of Gods
Miniſter; who is the ſteward
of the Lords houſe, to giue to
euery one his portion of meat
in ſeaſon. The faithfull Paſtor
in the congregation, is in
Chriſts ſteed<note n="y" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21</note>, &amp; hath power
to bind and looſe<note n="z" place="margin">Mat. 18. 18</note>. I ſay vnto
thee plainely, thou canſt neuer
take that true, ſound and ſolide
comfort in Chriſt, which is fit,
till thou haſt the authority of
Gods Miniſter to ſeale it vp
vnto thee. That which hee
putteth on thee, and applyeth
to thee, (thy heart being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prepared before hand) that
ſame is it wherupon thou maiſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16770:40"/>
reſt. Hee is that one man of
a thouſand, which muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
thy righteouſneſſe vnto
thee, that God may haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
on thee<note n="a" place="margin">Iob. 33. 23. 24.</note>. Loth would I
bee to preiudice any mans or
or womans comfort. Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one looke to himſelfe vp-what
ground he ſtandes: This
I am ſure, that he ſtandes vpon
the beſt and ſafeſt tearmes, who
can ſay touching his hope and
comfort in Chriſt Ieſus, This
I haue gotten by awaiting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
Gods ordinance; The
Miniſter who hath authority
from God, thus and thus hath
he ſpoken to my ſoule.</p>
            <p>Let vs now ſee in the third
place, whether this courſe bee
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16770:41"/>
not alſo (as I ſaid) moſt for mans
reſtraint. What man is there
but if hee were left vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
to take his owne choyce,
would not rather ſit ſtill warme
and quiet at home, and keepe
his money in his purſe for his
owne priuate occaſions, and
take his eaſe on the Sabbath
day, and ſatisfie himſelfe with
a reading Miniſter, then paine
his body, ſtraine his purſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
his peace, tye vp himſelfe
ſhorte from thoſe Sunday-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes,
which the men of the
Times are accuſtomed to, and
all this for preachings ſake?
Certainely, there is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to the fleſh by the other
ſtill courſe, then by that kinde
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16770:41"/>
of dependance vpon preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which I haue laboured to
perſwade. A man muſt reſolue
to cut himſelf ſhort in many
things, or elſe hee ſhall neuer
profit by it as is meet. I may
thus diſcouer the truth of this
Rule, in that other point alſo
touching Triall. How doth
this make to a mans humbling,
when he is not permitted to
truſt his owne firſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
but is required (in a kind
of iealouſie ouer him ſelfe and
in the diſclayming of his owne
iudgement) to ſeeke a Rule
out of himſelfe, by which to
examine that which hee muſt
make vſe of for himſelfe? How
doth it againe adde to a mans
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16770:42"/>
comfort? By this meanes hee
attaines to that ſweeteneſſe in
Religion, and to that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
which without this
he ſhould neuer haue percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
This will enable him to
ſay, Thy word is prooued to
be pure, &amp; thy ſeruant loueth
it<note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 119. 140.</note> How (laſtly) doth this
curbe a man in his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
deſire? For whereas of
himſelfe he would gladly end
his taſte with the act of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and ſo betake himſelfe
to ſome freer courſe; this calls
him to an after-reckoning,
and bindes him to a ſecond
labour of recounting &amp; view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all particulars; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
diligent inquirie into
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16770:42"/>
them for their certainty. And
thus haue I giuen an inſtance
or two for the application of
this Rule: and therein I end
this firſt part of my Text tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the firſt vertue therein
required, which I called Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
            <p>The next now followeth,<note place="margin">The ſecond Doctrine.</note>
which is concerning conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
(Keep that which is good).
The doctrine is, That that
which diligence of tryall
hath diſcouered to vs to bee
found, muſt with all faithfulnes
and perſeuerance be kept and
reteined to the end. The very
firſt view of the words will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
me from ſtrayning this
collection: Keepe that which
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:16770:43"/>
is good: Neuer leaue ſifting
of Doctrines till you haue
found the good: when you
haue found it, be ſure to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
it; a ſhame to haue taken
ſuch a deale of paines for it, &amp;
then to forſake it. The truth of
this point will bee the more
profitably diſcouered, if wee
ſhall be pleaſed to vnderſtand
and conſider, that there is a
three-fold keeping which may
very well be thought to bee
heere intended. 1 A keeping
in memory. 2 A keeping in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
3 A keeping in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
The firſt of theſe makes
way for the ſecond; the ſecond
for the third. Good muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
that it may be loued:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16770:43"/>
and it muſt bee loued, that it
may bee practiced. Touching
keeping of good and holy
things in memory theſe Texts
are plaine. Hide my Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
within thee<note n="c" place="margin">Pro. 2. 1</note>, Keepe
them in the midſt of thy hart<note n="d" place="margin">Pro. 4. 21</note>,
Take heed, keep thy ſoule di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
that thou forget not<note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 4. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>.
Theſe words ſhall bee in thy
heart<note n="f" place="margin">Deut. 6. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>. Remember the words
which I ſaid vnto you (ſaid our
Sauiour)<note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 15. 20</note>. Remember the
wordes which were ſpoken of
the Apoſtles<note n="h" place="margin">Iude 17</note>, Giue heede to
the things which wee haue
heard, leſt at any time wee
ſhould let them ſlip<note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 2. 1</note>. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
is as it were the treaſury
of the ſoule: what more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16770:44"/>
to bee laid vp in it, then
that wherewith the things of
the greateſt worth are not
meet to be compared<note n="k" place="margin">Pro. 3. 14</note>. Holy
doctrine is (as I may call it)
the food of the ſoule. It is the
portion of meat ſpoken of in
the Goſpell<note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 12. 42</note>. Now what good
will a mans meate doe him if he
voide it vp, through weakneſs
of ſtomack as faſt as it is eaten?
the body thereby can receiue
no nouriſhment. Elſe-where
that which is commended to vs
by preaching, is compared to
ſeed<note n="m" place="margin">Luk. 8. 11</note>. Now when the ſeed is
caſt into the ground, if the
birds do by &amp; by pick it vp, or
the ſwine ſtrait way deuoure it
vp, Is there any hope of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt?
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:16770:44"/>
It is ſo in this. Be that
which we haue gotten by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
neuer ſo excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if it tary
not with vs it cannot auaile vs.
It may bring a man to ſome
ſmell of Religion; neuer to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
truth or power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Well, as it muſt be kept
in memory, ſo in affection too;
my meaning is, a man muſt
perſiſt in the earneſt loue and
zealous profeſsion thereof.
There muſt be no declining
nor going back, no ſlaking of
that firſt egerneſs with which
hee ſeemed in the beginning
to embrace it. This is that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
faſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended by Chriſt
to the Church of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia
<note n="n" place="margin">Reu. 3. 11</note>, and the want hereof was
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16770:45"/>
the blemiſh of Epheſus; it is
taxed in her by the tearmes of
loſing her firſt loue<note n="o" place="margin">Reu. 2. 4</note>. There
may be an intertaining of good
things with ioy, which yet va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
like a morning clowde;
and as it commeth to nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſo it is worth nothing. It is
good to loue alwaies earneſtly
in a good thing<note n="p" place="margin">Gal. 4. 18</note>. When the
beginnings bee hot, and the
proceedings but warme, the
concluſion generally is colde,
and the end of ſuch is fearful<note n="q" place="margin">Luk. 11. 26</note>.
The children of God muſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
encreaſe<note n="r" place="margin">1 The. 4. 1</note> and grow<note n="s" place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 18</note>, &amp;
go from ſtrength to ſtrength<note n="t" place="margin">Pſa. 84. 7</note>,
and ſhine more and more<note n="u" place="margin">Pro. 4. 18</note>,
and follow hard toward the
marke<note n="x" place="margin">Phil. 3. 14</note>. Then (thirdly)
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:16770:45"/>
there muſt be alſo a keeping
in practice. That good which
is found muſt be obeyed. This
is that keeping, to which
Chriſt promiſeth a bleſsing<note n="y" place="margin">Luk. 11. 28</note>,
which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mends<note n="z" place="margin">Iam. 1. 25</note>,
&amp; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> 
               <hi>Dauid</hi> aymeth at in that
affectionate ſpeech, Oh that
my waies were directed, that
I may keepe thy ſtatutes<note n="a" place="margin">Pſ. 119. 11</note>.
There is no ſuch keeping here
meant, as that of the greedy
men of the world, in hoarding
vp their treaſure, euen vntill
the cankering and ruſting ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<note n="b" place="margin">Iam. 5. 3</note>, be ready to witnes againſt
them, and as a fire to eate their
fleſh: but this is a keeping for
vſe. Such a keeping <hi>Dauid</hi>
ſpeakes of, I haue hid thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16770:46"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

in my heart, that I might
not ſinne againſt thee<note n="c" place="margin">Pſ. 119. 11</note>; he ſo
kept the knowledge of holy
things in his minde, that hee
might produce them into prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
The truth is, if a man
doe hold faſt the truth of God
in his affection, he cannot but
ſhew forth the fruites of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to it in his practice:
The abundance which is in his
heart, cannot but breake forth
into his outward man. This is
like that oyle in a mans right
hand which vttereth it ſelfe<note n="d" place="margin">Pro. 27. 16</note>.
It is as the wine, which will ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
breake the veſſels in which
it is, then it will want vent<note n="e" place="margin">Iob. 32. 19</note>.
The ſweetneſſe which a man
findes and feeles in it, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:16770:47"/>
it louing entertainement
in his heart, will ſo rauiſh him,
that he cannot but bewray the
contentment which hee findes
therein, by his outward carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
His whole life and courſe
will proclaime and teſtifie the
zealous affection of his ſoule.
Can a man loue the truth in his
heart, and not tender the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
thereof? And is it poſsible
to bring more credit to it,
then to be bold and reſolute
in obeying it? to be careleſſe
of credit, peace, profit, and
what ſoeuer els by nature man
affects, ſo that hee may walke
therein? It is in vaine for a man
to profeſſe to loue religion in
his heart, if hee diſclaime the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:16770:48"/>
rule, and authority, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of it in his life. As, if a man
ſhould proteſt he loues me, but
when I come to try him hee
will doe nothing for mee;
will I beleeue his proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
So then, this may ſatisfie
vs for this point; If I would
keep life in the graces of Gods
ſpirit which I haue receiued,
I muſt honour prophecying:
My honouring of prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
muſt be tempered with try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that which is deliuered by
it: when by tryall I haue found
out that which I am ſure is
good, I muſt reſolue vpon
keeping it, I muſt keepe it in
memory, and ſtriue not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
it. I muſt keep it in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:16770:48"/>
and labour not to loſe my
firſt loue to it. I muſt keepe it
in practice, that all my whole
life &amp; carriage may adorne it.
To labour to finde out good,
and when it is found, not to
remember it is ridiculous: to
remember it and yet to make
no account of it, is vaine: to
ſay I make account of it, and
yet doe not practice it, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd:
I ſtriue to remember it,
I labour to effect it, I make
conſcience to obey it, this is
excellent.</p>
            <p>Think you,<note place="margin">The Vſe.</note> whether this be
not a very neceſſarie point to
be remembred to vs, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
what ill Keepers generally
we bee in matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:16770:49"/>
For touching the firſt
kinde of keeping, which is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;
beſides that naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
which is in vs in things
of this kinde, how iuſtly are we
chargeable with a kinde of
willing forgetfulneſſe? It is not
our purpoſe nor our care to
remember, wee are euen very
well content to loſe theſe
particulars. Wee who can
whine and fret for other loſſes,
and be angry with our ſelues,
and ſay, what a beaſt was I to
forget this, and not to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that; are yet neuer trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
though multitudes of
good points of doctrine run
through vs, as through a pipe,
or fall from vs, as water from
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:16770:49"/>
a Swans back, leauing behind
within vs no impreſsion. Doe
but ſpeak ſoothly (I pray you)
betwixt God and your ſoules,
and ſay, when did you ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in prayer lament your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe,
and entreat the
Lord to pardon it? This ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
we are guilty of a kinde of
affected forgetfulneſs. I would
this were all our failing (though
this be bad enough) but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
yet more abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
Alas how looſe are wee
in our affections to holy things?
There is (I confeſſe) a kinde
of ſodain heate, which ariſeth
in ſome, ſomewhat violent
at the firſt, like the fluſhings in
the face of a man who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16770:50"/>
diſtempered. Oh, what
will not they doe? they march

they will read, they will ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Sabbath, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
their families, they will
ſweare no more, &amp;c. but (woe
is me) what is more ordinarie
then to ſee euery day many
ſuch paſſe away, as the riſing
of Riuers<note n="f" place="margin">Iob 6. 15</note>? their great heate
is ſoone aſſwaged, they are
quickly wearie of that ſeruice,
which they ſeemed to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
with a great deale of
feruency. How full are our
dayes, of ſuch vpon whom
when a man lookes hee may
with a kinde of mournefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16770:50"/>
ſay, Are all their
great ſhews come to this? Nay,
let the beſt profeſſors (if they
be wiſe) conſider themſelues
touching this, and compare
together their preſent courſe
with their firſt beginnings, and
ſee whether they haue not let
goe a great deale of their firſt
holde, and are euen come the
very next ſtep to a Laodicean
temper. I knowe nothing
wherein a wiſe Chriſtian hath
more cauſe to feare himſelfe
then this, that his loue is not
ſo earneſt, nor his zeale ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
as it hath been. This ſame
decaying in affection, it is like
a conſumption, it ſteales vpon
a man, and is farre growne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16770:51"/>
him many times, yea euen
wel-neer to an incurable pitch
before it bee perceiued. Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it, will be a meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
it. We liue in a cooling
Climate, and wee ſhall finde it
as hard to keepe this heat in
vs, as it was to maintain <hi>Dauids</hi>
naturall heate when hee was
old<note n="g" place="margin">1 Kin. 1. 1</note>. I haue ſhewed our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in the two firſt kindes of
keeping: let vs ſee what may
be found in vs touching the
third, Keeping in practice.
And here (me ſeemeth) I am
ſodainely ſtriken with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and knowe not what to
ſay: not for lack of matter, but
for lack of skill to drawe, into
few words, ſuch a world of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16770:51"/>
as this particularity doth
afford. Here a man might fill
euen a roule of a booke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
and without<note n="h" place="margin">Ezek. 2. 10</note>, with accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
cenſures, complaints,
threatnings, againſt all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
ages, conditions, ſexes.
Somewhat happely we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
ſomewhat we ſeeme to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme
and to profeſſe: but what
is our practice? I ſpeake not
now touching thoſe, which are
at a kinde of enmity with all
religion, and care not though
they be noted and knowne to
bee of none: but let vs looke
to our ſelues, who would bee
thought to haue a regarde to
goodneſſe, and ſome reſpect to
the beſt things, who come to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16770:52"/>
heare, &amp; will needs be thought
to loue that courſe, to approue
it, to vpholde it, and ſee how
poore and barren is our prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
Alas, that we ſhould not
onely giue cauſe to papiſts to
ſpeak euill of our Religion, &amp;
Faith, through our barrenneſs,
but (which is worſe) ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the mouthes of profane
wretches amongſt our ſelues,
to tax profeſsion and hearing,
as the nurſery of licentiouſnes.
The truth is, the liues &amp; cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of many, who yet will come
and ſit, as Gods people vſeth
to come<note n="i" place="margin">Ezek. 33 31</note>, are very ſcandalous.
For my own part, though I wil
not ioyne with thoſe, who vrge
this to the diſreputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16770:52"/>
are affected well, yet I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſeek to excuſe their euils,
but ſay rather with the Apoſtle
They ſhall beare their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whoſoeuer they bee<note n="k" place="margin">Gal. 5. 10</note>. I
haue almoſt done: I will now
draw to an exhortation, and I
beſeech you that I may preuail
with you for this Keeping du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
It is ſuch a keeping, as by
which your ſelues ſhall bee
kept vnto ſaluation. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
entertainment for ſuch
a gueſt, at whoſe entrance into
thy ſoule, thou mayſt ſay, as
Chriſt did at his comming to
<hi>Zacheus</hi> his houſe, This day is
ſaluation come to thee<note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 19 9</note>. It
ſhall be to thy ſoule, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Arke of <hi>Obed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edoms</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:16770:53"/>
houſe<note n="m" place="margin">2 Sam. 7 11</note>. Loſe not al your
labour (I pray you) in repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
hither; you cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
an houre worſe, then by
going to a Sermon and get
nothing. Hearken what wee
ſay: we may ſay with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
boldneſſe, we are the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
of Chriſt, wee are
the Meſſengers of the Lord of
hoſts, we ſpeake wordes vnto
you, by which you and yours
may be ſaued: Yet, heare vs as
men ſubiect to infirmities, hear
vs with diſcretion: Bring vs to
the touch. Oh, that you would
once doe vs that honour, to
Try our doctrine. If you finde
any thing to be good (as no
doubt you ſhall) what will you
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16770:53"/>
do to it? looke vpon it awhile,
and (as it were) play with it, as
little children with a new-bought
toy which within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
they caſt away? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.
God will not be ſo anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Labour to locke it vp in
your memories: reſolue with
<hi>Dauid,</hi> I will not forget thy
wordes<note n="n" place="margin">Pſa. 119 16</note>; pray the God of
peace, to write his law in your
hearts, ſtriue to loue it, and
that will be a good helpe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it. Can a maid forget
her ornament and a bride her
attire<note n="o" place="margin">Ier. 2. 32</note>? Her loue to it, makes
her not to forget it. I neuer
heard (ſaith the Orator) of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man ſo old, as that hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
where he laid his treaſure.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:16770:54"/>
When you remember it, ſtriue
to worke your affections to
embrace it more and more. Be
conſtant to the death, and you
ſhall receiue the crowne of
life<note n="p" place="margin">Reu. 2. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>. Reſolue touching that
which you haue found to bee
true, &amp; ſo accordingly haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to profeſſe, as that worthy
Thebane ſouldier did touching
his buckler, I will either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
thee, or die vpon thee.
Say to the Truth when thou
haſt once met with it, as <hi>Ruth</hi>
did to <hi>Naomi;</hi> The Lord do ſo
to me and more alſo, if ought
but death departe thee and
mee<note n="q" place="margin">Ruth 1. 17</note>. And when you haue
thus faſtned your affections to
it, then let mee ſay to you, as
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:16770:54"/>
               <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> did to his Officers
when hee ſent them on the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit,
Be of courage and doe
it, and the Lord ſhall bee with
that good<note n="r" place="margin">2 Chr. 19 11</note>. Let your vertue
and your knowledge go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<note n="s" place="margin">2 pet. 1. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>. Thus do, &amp; the God of
peace ſhall be with you. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
remember to bee practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
of good in your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
places, Magiſtrates in
yours, Miniſters in yours, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of families in yours. In
your ranks &amp; ſtandings make
your care of obedience to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.
This is that courſe
which ſhall bring you peace
and comfort at the laſt. God
will bee good vnto thoſe that
are good: ſuch as turne aſide
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:16770:55"/>
by their crooked waies, them
ſhall the Lord leade, with the
workers of iniquity<note n="t" place="margin">pſa. 125 4. 5</note>. Woe
vnto their ſoules, for they haue
rewarded euill to themſelues<note n="u" place="margin">Iſa. 3. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
