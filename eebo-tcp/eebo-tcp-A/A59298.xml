            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CHARACTER OF A Popiſh Succeſſour, AND What <hi>England</hi> may expect from ſuch a One.</head>
            <p>IT has been my Fortune to be a <hi>Subject</hi> and a <hi>Native</hi> of that part of the <hi>World,</hi> where almoſt three years laſt paſt I have ſcarce heard any thing, but the continual Noiſe of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Plots,</hi> with all the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Fears of a jealous <hi>Kingdom,</hi> about my Ears. And truly, I muſt plainly confeſs, I am not ſo ill a <hi>Commonwealths-man,</hi> but that I am glad to ſee my Country-men diſturb'd in a Cauſe, where <hi>Religion, Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> are at ſtake. If their Jealouſies are juſt, and their Fears pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick, in God's Name let them talk. Every good man ought to be ſo far from ſilencing any reaſonable Murmurs, that 'tis rather his Duty to bear a Part in a Choire ſo Univerſal. And if we ſee the Great and Wiſe Men of our Nation, like true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Patriots, ſtrugling and toiling to prevent our threatning Calamities, let us take delight to behold them reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and uneaſie, rolling about our troubled Sea, like <hi>Porpoiſes</hi> againſt a Tempeſt, to forewarn us of an approaching Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But amidſt our evident Danger, we ſee another ſort of People daily ſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and deluding us into a falſe and fatal Security. And ſure none are ſo little our Friends, or indeed ſo void even of Humanity it ſelf, as thoſe who wou'd lull us aſleep when Ruine is in view. But ſince Zeal and Hypocriſie, naked Truth and artificial Falſhood, have oftentimes alike Faces, I cannot but think it the Duty both of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man, to unravel the Treachery of thoſe falſe Arguments which they raiſe to deſtroy us.</p>
            <p>As firſt, they ſay, <hi>Why ſhou'd we ſtand in fear of Popery, when in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Temper of</hi> England <hi>'tis impoſſible for any Succeſſour whatever to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And next, amidſt our groundleſs Fears, (ſay they) <hi>Let us conſider what that Prince is that appears ſo dreadful a</hi> Gorgon <hi>to</hi> England. <hi>A Prince that on all accounts has ſo ſignally ventur'd his Life for his King and Country: A Heroe of that faithful and matchleſs Courage and Loyalty: A Prince of that unſhaken Honour and Reſolution, that his Word has ever been known to be his Oracle, and his Friendſhip a Bulwark whereever he vouchſafes to place it; with ſuch an infinite Maſs of all the Bravery and Gallantry that can adorn a Prince. Why, muſt the change of his Religion deſtroy his Humanity, or the advance to a Crown render his Word or Honour leſs Sacred, or make him a Tyrant to that very People whom he has ſo often and ſo chearfully defended? Why, may there not be a Popiſh King with all theſe Accompliſhments, that whatever his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50753:3"/>
Devotions ſhall be, yet ſhall publickly maintain the Proteſtant Worſhip, with all the preſent Conſtitution of Government, unalter'd?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yes, now I ſay ſomething! If this <hi>Rara avis in terris</hi> can be found, then <hi>England</hi> were in a happy condition. But, alas! what ſignifie all the great paſt Actions of a Princes Life, when <hi>Popery</hi> at laſt has got the Aſcendant? All Vertues muſt truckle to Religion; and how little an Impreſſion will all his recorded Glories leave behind them, when <hi>Rome</hi> has once ſtampt him her Proſelyte?</p>
            <p>But ſince unlikely things may come to paſs, let us ſeriouſly examine how far the Notion of ſuch a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſour</hi> conſiſts with Reaſon, or indeed has the leaſt ſhadow of poſſibility.</p>
            <p>If to maintain and defend our <hi>Religion</hi> be any more than a Name, it is impoſſible for any Man to act the true Defenſive Part, without the Offenſive too: And he that wou'd effectually uphold the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Worſhip, Peace, and Intereſt, is bound to ſuppreſs all thoſe potent and dangerous Enemies that wou'd deſtroy'em; for all other Defence is but Diſguiſe and Counterfeit.</p>
            <p>If then the Wiſdom of ſeveral Succeſſive Monarchs, with a whole Nations unanimous Prudence, and indefatigable Care for the Proteſtant Preſervation, has determin'd, That thoſe Popiſh Prieſts who have ſworn Fealty to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and taken Orders in Foreign Seminaries, are the greateſt Seducers of the King's Liege-People, and the moſt notorious Incendiaries and Subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Proteſtant Chriſtianity and Loyalty; and for that Cauſe their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Laws declare them Traytors; by conſequence theſe are the potent and dangerous Enemies which, in defence of the Proteſtant Cauſe, this Popiſh King is oblig'd to ſuppreſs and puniſh, and theſe the very Laws he is bound to execute.</p>
            <p>And though, perhaps, till the Diſcovery of the late Plot, for ſeveral Ages we have not ſeen that Severity inflicted on Popiſh Prieſts, as the Laws againſt them require; and why? becauſe the flouriſhing Tranquility of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church under this King and his Father's Reign, rendred them ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable an Adverſary, that the natural tenderneſs of the Proteſtant People of <hi>England,</hi> not delighting in Blood, did not think it worth their while either to detect or proſecute 'em, and therefore has not made 'em the common Mark of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>But under the Reign of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſt, when the Fraternity of their Religion ſhall encourage the Pope to make his working Emiſſaries ten times more numerous; when, if not the hope of Publick Patronage, yet at leaſt their confidence of Private Indulgence, Connivance, and Mercy, emboldens the Miſſive Obedience of his Jeſuitical Inſtruments, whilſt the very Name of a Popiſh Monarch has the Influence of the Sun in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and daily warms our Mud into Monſters, till they are become our moſt threatning and moſt formidable Enemies. And if ever the Proteſtant Religion wanted a Defender, 'tis then. If the Word, Honour, or Coronation Oath of a King be more than a Name, 'tis then or never he is oblig'd to uphold the Proteſtant Intereſt, and actually ſuppreſs its moſt apparent and moſt notorious Enemies.</p>
            <p>Well then, for Arguments ſake, by the vertue of a ſtrong Faith (a Faith ſo ſtrong as may remove Mountains) let us ſuppoſe we may have ſuch a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick</hi> King, as ſhall diſcountenance Pope and Popery, cheriſh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiſm, and effectually deter and puniſh all thoſe that ſhall endeavour to undermine and ſupplant it: and then let us examine what this King, thus qualified, muſt do.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, in continuing the Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction, Honours, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments in the Hands of the Proteſtant Clergy, he muſt confer his Favours
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50753:3"/>
and Smiles on thoſe very Men, whom (by the Fundamentals of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Perſuaſion, which dooms all that dye out of the Boſom of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church to a certain ſtate of Damnation) he cordially believes do preach and teach, and lead his Subjects in the direct way to Hell: And next, at the ſame time he muſt not only puniſh and perſecute, but perhaps impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and hang thoſe very only Righteous Men, whom from the bottom of his Soul he believes can onely open them the Gates of Paradiſe: whilſt in ſo doing he cannot but accuſe himſelf of copying the old <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cruelty. Nay, in one reſpect he out-goes their Crime; for he acts that knowingly, which they committed ignorantly. For, by the Dictates of his Religion he muſt be convinc'd, that in effect he does little leſs than ſave a <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A very pretty <hi>Chimaera!</hi> Which is as much as to make this Popiſh King the greateſt Barbarian in the Creation; a Barbarian that ſhall cheriſh and maintain the Diſſenters from Truth, and puniſh and condemn the Pillars of Chriſtianity, and Proſelytes of Heaven: Which is no other than to ſpeak him the baſeſt of Men, and little leſs than a Monſter. Beſides, at the ſame time that we ſuppoſe that King that dares not uphold nor encourage his own Religion, we render him the moſt deplorable of Cowards; a Coward ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that he dares not be a Champion even for his God. And how conſiſtent this is with the Glory of a Crown'd Head, and what hope <hi>England</hi> has of ſuch a Succeſſour, I leave all Men of Senſe to judge.</p>
            <p>Beſides, What miſ-match'd incongruous Ingredients muſt go to make up this Compoſition of a King! His Hand and Heart muſt be of no Kin to one another: He muſt be ſo inhumane to thoſe very darling <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> that like <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Pidgeon infus'd and whiſper'd all his Heavenly Dreams into his Ears, that he muſt not only clip their Wings, but fairly Cage 'em too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even for the charming Oracles they breath'd him: And at the ſame minute he muſt leave the wide and open Air to thoſe very Ravens that daily croak Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence and Confuſion to them, and all their holy Dreams, and their falſe Oracles. Thus whilſt he acts quite contrary to all his Inclinations, againſt the whole bent of his Soul, what does he but publickly put in force thoſe Laws for the Proteſtant Service, 'till in fine, for his Nations Peace, he ruines his own, and is a whole Scene of War within himſelf? Whilſt his Conſcience accuſing his Sloth on one ſide, the <hi>Pope</hi> on the other, <hi>Romes</hi> continual Bulls bellowing againſt him, as an undutiful unactive Son of Holy Mother Church, a Scandal to her Glory, a Traytor to her Intereſt, and a Deſerter of her Cauſe; one day accuſing the Lukewarmneſs of his Religion, another the Puſilanimity of his Nature; all <hi>Roman Catholick Princes</hi> deriding the feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Spirit, and the tameneſs of his Arm: till at long run, to ſpare a Faggot in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> he does little leſs than walk on hot Irons himſelf. Thus all the Pleaſure he reliſhes on a Throne, is but a kind of <hi>Good-Fryday</hi> Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. In ſtead of a Royal Feſtival, his rioting in all the Luxury of his Heart, to ſee <hi>Romes Dagon</hi> worſhipp'd, <hi>Romes</hi> Altars ſmoak, <hi>Romes</hi> Standard ſet up, <hi>Romes</hi> Enemies defeated, and his victorious Mother Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant; his abject and poor-ſpirited Submiſſion denies himſelf the only thing he thirſts for: And whilſt the Principles he ſucks from <hi>Rome</hi> do in effect in the Prophets words bid him, <hi>Riſe, ſlay and eat,</hi> his Fear, his unkingly, nay unmanly Fear, makes him faſt and ſtarve.</p>
            <p>However, if there be ſuch a King in Nature, as will not defend his own Religion, becauſe he dares not; but ſneaks upon a Throne, and in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Fear ſhrinks from the Dictates of his Conſcience, and the Service of his God: If, like <hi>Jupiters</hi> Log, ſuch a King can be, and Fate has ordain'd us for a Popiſh Prince, pray Heaven ſhrowd the Imperial Lion in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50753:4"/>
Lambs-skin. But I am afraid we ſhall ſcarce be ſo happy; and I ſhrewdly ſuſpect, that all thoſe cunning <hi>Catholick</hi> Trumpetters who in all Companies found the Innocence of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſour,</hi> and flatter us with ſuch a hopeful, harmleſs, peaceful Prince in a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> have a little of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Mental Reſervation in the Promiſes they make us, and no ſmall <hi>Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Equivocation in the Airy Caſtles they build us.</p>
            <p>But I have heard ſome ſay, <hi>Why, may there not be a zealous Prince of any Religion, who ſtill out of the meer Principles of Morality, ſhall have that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and ſenſe of his Peoples Peace, as to trouble himſelf about Religion no farther than concerns his own Salvation; and therefore continue the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Laws and Devotion in the ſame Channel he found them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all this his meer Morality ſhall do! Alas! alas! If he's a Bigot in Religion, all his Morals are Slaves to his Zeal. Nay, grant him to be the moſt abſolute Maſter of all the <hi>Cardinal Vertues,</hi> there's not one of them that ſhall not be a particular Inſtrument for our Deſtruction. As for Example, allow him <hi>Fortitude,</hi> ſuppoſe him a Prince of matchleſs Courage: So much the 2worſe; what does that but make him the more daring, and more adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, in puſhing on the Cauſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> and with a more undaunted and manly patience bear all the Oppoſitions he meets in the way. If he be a Man of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> that ſtill makes for <hi>Rome</hi>: for whilſt he believes the <hi>Pope</hi> to be <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Lawful Vicar, and that that Office includes the Eccleſiaſtical Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, no doubt but he'll think it as much the Duty of his <hi>Cſtriſtianity</hi> to give the Pope his Right, as to take his own: And in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own Words, that <hi>give unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſar<hi>'s, and unto God thoſe things that are God's,</hi> he'll certainly judge the <hi>Popes</hi> Reſtoration as great a piece of Juſtice, as his own Coronation. Then if he be a Maſter of <hi>Temperance,</hi> in the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſenſe of this Moral Vertue, <hi>viz.</hi> a Man that can govern his Paſſions, that's ſtill as bad: For he that has the moſt bridled Paſſions, has always the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and ſteadieſt Reſolutions. Who ſo renown'd for Conſtancy, ſo fixt in his Reſolves, and ſo unalterable in his determin'd Purpoſes, as that <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was never heard to rage, or ſcarce ſeen to frown? Nay, Hiſtory gives this Character of him, That after the diſcovery of his Queens Adultery with his own Son, at the ſame minute that he order'd her a Bowl of Poyſon, he did not ſo much as change his Look, or Voice, either to his treacherous Son, or his inceſtuous Wife. And what ſo fit a Pillar for <hi>Popery,</hi> as ſuch Conſtancy in a King?</p>
            <p>But if we take <hi>Temperance</hi> in its larger ſignification, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſelf-denial of a Man's Worldly Appetites; ſtill worſe and worſe: For a Riotous Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Monarch bounds his Ambition wholly in the Pleaſures of a Crown, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns his Reins to his Charioteers, and leaves the Toil of Power to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Magiſtrates, like the Work of Fate to Second Cauſes; whilſt his Intemperance ſo ſlackens his Zeal, that it unbends thoſe very Nerves, which otherwiſe might be more ſtrenuouſly wound up for our Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, If he has <hi>Prudence,</hi> that's worſt of all. That's his onely win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Card; the onely leading Vertue that manages his Policies and Conduct with that Care and Art, till he effects the Buſineſs of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ripens that mighty Work to a perfection, which otherwiſe an overforward fool-hardy Zeal, by ill management, might deſtroy.</p>
            <p>Thus his very <hi>Cardinal Vertues</hi> are the abſolute Hinges that open the Gates to <hi>Rome.</hi> Alas! where Superſtition rules the day, all Moral Vertues are but thoſe leſſer Lights that take their Illumination from that greater Orb above 'em. And thus, what boots it in a Popiſh Heir, to ſay he's the trueſt Friend, the greateſt of <hi>Heroes,</hi> the beſt of Maſters, the juſteſt Judge, or the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſteſt of Men? All meer treacherous Quickſands for a People to repoſe the leaſt glimpſe of Safety in, or build the leaſt Hopes upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50753:4"/>But I have heard a great many ſay, <hi>It cannot enter into their thoughts, that a Popiſh Succeſſour will ever take ſuch an inhumane and ſo unnatual a Courſe to eſtabliſh Popery, it being ſo abſolutely againſt the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Conſtitution, that it can never be introduced with leſs than a Deluge of Blood. Surely his very Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould withold him from ſo much Cruelty, conſidering how much more it would be for his Immortal Honour, to have the univerſal Prayers than the Curſes of a Nation. And one would think a King would ſo much more endeavour to win the Hearts, than the Hatred of his People, that certainly in all probability this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrick Motion, this disjoynting the whole Harmony of a World, ſhould be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to him, that no Religion whatever ſhould put ſuch a thought into his Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all this his Glory ſhall do? His Glory! The Glory of a <hi>Papiſt!</hi> A pretty Airy Notion. How ſhall we ever expect that Glory ſhall ſteer the Actions of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſour,</hi> when there is not that thing ſo abject that he ſhall refuſe to do, or that Shape or Hypocriſie ſo ſcandalous he ſhall not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, when <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Romes</hi> Intereſt ſhall command; nay, when his own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant Stubbornneſs ſhall but ſway him? As for example; For one fit he ſhall come to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church, and be a Member of their Communion, notwithſtanding at the ſame time his Face belies his Heart, and in his Soul he is a <hi>Romaniſt.</hi> Nay, he ſhall vary his Diſguiſes as often as an <hi>Algerine</hi> his Colours, and change his Flag to conceal the Pyrate. As for inſtance; Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fit, for whole Years together, he ſhall come neither to one Church nor th'other, and participate of neither Communion, till ignobly he plays the unprincely, nay the unmanly Hypocrite, ſo long, that he ſhelters him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the Face of an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> to ſhrowd a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> A Vizor more fit for a <hi>Banditto,</hi> than a Prince. And this methinks is ſo wretched and ſo deſpicable a Diſguiſe, that it looks like being aſham'd of his God.</p>
            <p>Beſides, If Glory could have any Aſcendant over a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſour,</hi> one would think the Word of a King, and the Solemn Proteſtations of Majeſty, ought to be Sacred and Inviolable. But how many Precedents have we in <hi>Popiſh</hi> Princes to convince us, their ſtrongeſt Engagements and Promiſes are lighter than the very Breath that utters 'em. As for Examples ſake; How did their Saint <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England</hi> promiſe the <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> Inhabitants the unmoleſted continuation of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Worſhip, calling her God (that God that ſaw the falſeneſs of her Heart) to witneſs, <hi>That though her own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion was of the Romiſh Faith, yet ſhe would content her ſelf with the private Exerciſe of her own Devotion, and preſerve the then Proteſtant Government, with all her Subjects Rights and Priviledges, uninjur'd.</hi> Upon which thoſe poor, credulous, honeſt, deluded Believers, on the ſecurity of ſuch prevalent Conjurations, led by the miſtaken Reverence they paid to a proteſting Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, laid their Lives at her Feet, and were the very Men that in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of the Succeſſion plac'd her on a Throne: But immediately, when her Soveraign Power was ſecurely eſtabliſhed, and his pious Holineſs had bid her ſafely pull the Vizor off, no ſooner did <hi>Smithfield</hi> glow with Piles of blazing Hereticks, but Chronicles more particularly obſerve, that no Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in her whole Kingdom felt ſo ſignal Marks of her Vengeance, as thoſe very Men that raiſed her to a Throne. Her Princely Gratitude for their Crowning her with a Diadem, Crown'd them with their Martyrdoms.</p>
            <p>But ſince we have mentioned her Princely Gratitude, 'twill not be amiſs to recollect one Inſtance more of ſo exemplary a Vertue. In the Diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt hers, and the Lady <hi>Jane Grays</hi> Title to the Crown, it was remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that all the Judges of <hi>England</hi> gave their unanimous Opinions for the Lady <hi>Janes</hi> Succeſſion, except one of them only, that aſſerted the right of <hi>Mary</hi>: But it ſo fell out, that this Man proving a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all the whole Scarlet Robe he had been her only Champion) was ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50753:5"/>
barbarouſly perſecuted by her, that being firſt degraded, then impriſon'd and tortur'd for his Religion, the cruelty of his Tormentors was ſo ſavage, that with his own hand he made himſelf away to eſcape 'em. And well might the violence of his Deſpair ſufficiently teſtifie his Sufferings were intolerable, when he fled to ſo ſad a Refuge as Self-murder for a Deliverance.</p>
            <p>But here ſays another Objection, <hi>Suppoſe that the Conſervation of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Peace, the Dictates of a Princes Glory, and all the Bonds of Morality, cannot have any influence over a Popiſh Succeſſour; yet why may there not be that Prince, who in veneration of his Coronation Oath, ſhall defend the Proteſtant Religion, notwithſtanding all his private regret, and inclinations to the contrary? When rather than incur the infamous brand of Perjury, he ſhall tie himſelf to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that, which not the force of Religion it ſelf ſhall violate? And then, how can there be that Infidel of a Subject, after ſo ſolemn an Oath, that ſhall not believe him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why, truly, I am afraid there are a great many of thoſe Infidels, and ſome that will give ſmart Reaſons for their Infidelity: For, if he keeps his Oath, we muſt allow, that the only Motive that prompts him to keep it, is ſome Obligation that he believes is in an Oath. But conſidering he is of a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that can abſolve Subjects from their Allegiance to an Heretical Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated Prince, nay depoſe him, and take his very Crown away; why may it not much more releaſe a King from his Faith to an Excommunicated Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical People, by ſo much as the Ties of Vaſſals to Monarchs, are greater than thoſe of Monarchs to Vaſſals?</p>
            <p>But 'twill not be amiſs, for ſtrengthning this Argument, to give the World an Inſtance of the power of an Oath with a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> King.</p>
            <p>There is a famous Gentleman on the other ſide the Water, whom we all very well know, (pray Heaven we live not to be better acquainted with him than we deſire) that once took the ſtrongeſt of Oaths, the Sacrament, <hi>That he would never invade nor make war upon Flanders.</hi> But whether or no his <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour</hi> found ſome <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> Loop-hole from that Sacrament, or that the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> could not hold him, we ſee that <hi>Flanders</hi> of late years has not liv'd ſo merrily, nor ſo peaceably, as ſo Royal a Voucher (one would have thought) might have aſſured them they ſhould.</p>
            <p>And now let us a little balance the difference between the Breach of his Oath, and that of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Princes in <hi>England.</hi> All the Motives that could provoke him to the breach of his Oath, was only his Ambition, a Luſt of being Great: And at the ſame time that he is an Invader of his Neighbouring Princes, his Conſcience muſt tell him his Conqueſts are at beſt but ſo many glorious Robberies, and all his Trophies but ſhining Rapines. Was it not the ſenſe of this that made <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, who may be alſo called <hi>Great,</hi> after all his Victories, retire from a Throne into a Cloyſter, out of meer remorſe for all the Streams of Blood he had ſhed, to make the laſt part of his Life an Attonement for the Faults of the firſt?</p>
            <p>And then if a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> can break an Oath only for the pleaſure of Conquering, which he knows is doing ill; ſhall not a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prince in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have ten times more inclination to break an Oath for the propagation of his own Faith, which his Conſcience tells him is Meritorious? For, beſides the ſpecious flattery, <hi>That Kings can do no ill,</hi> and <hi>That all Crimes are cancelled in a Crown,</hi> he has Religion to drive the Royal <hi>Jehu</hi> on; Religion, that from the beginning of the World, thro' all Ages, has ſet all Nations in a Flame, yet never confeſſes it ſelf in the wrong. Beſides, how can a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prince, in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to eſtabliſh his own Religion, believe he does his Subjects an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in that very thing in which he does God Juſtice; or think he injures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hem, when he does their Souls right? Alas! no: When <hi>Rome</hi> by her inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50753:5"/>
Witchcrafts has lifted the full Bowl of her Inchantments to his Lips, what will his holy enthuſiaſtick Rage do leſs than the hot-brain'd drunken <hi>Alexander?</hi> All his beſt Friends, and every honeſt <hi>Clytus</hi> that dares but thwart his Frenzy, is preſently his Frenzies Sacrifice: only with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; the frantick <hi>Alexander,</hi> after his drunken Fit was over, in his milder and more ſenſible Intervals, with all the compunctions of penitence, could mourn and groan for what his blinder Rage had murder'd: But Religious Frenzy leaves that eternal Intoxication behind it, that where it commits all the Cruelties in the World, 'tis never ſober after to be ſorry for't. Thus whilſt a <hi>Popiſh</hi> King ſets his whole Kingdom in a combuſtion, how little does he think he plays a ſecond <hi>Nero?</hi> Good conſciencious Man, not he: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! he does not tune his Joys to the Tyrannick <hi>Nero</hi>'s <hi>Harp,</hi> but to <hi>David</hi>'s milder and more ſacred <hi>Lyre</hi>; whilſt in the height of his pious Ecſtaſie he ſings <hi>Te Deum</hi> at the Conflagration. Thus with an Arbitrary unbounded Power, what does his licencious holy thirſt of Blood do leſs, than make his Kingdom a larger Slaughter-houſe, and his <hi>Smithfield</hi> an Original Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles? Thus the old <hi>Moloch</hi> once again revives, to feaſt and riot on his dear Humane Sacrifice: And whilſt his fiery Iron Hands cruſh the poor burning Victime dead, the propagation of Religion, and the Glory of God, as he calls it, are the very Trumpets that deafen all the feeble Cries of Blood, and drown the dying Groans of what he murders.</p>
            <p>Thus whilſt the Bonds of Faith, Vows, Oaths, and Sacraments can't hold a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſour,</hi> what is that in an Imperial Head, but what in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man we puniſh with a Gaol and Pillory; whilſt the perjur'd Wretch ſtands the univerſal Mark of Infamy, and then is driven from all Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and like a Monſter hooted from Light and Day. But the <hi>Pope</hi> and a Royal Hand may do any thing; there's a Crown in the caſe to gild the Deeds his Royal Engins act.

They are ſtill that adorable Sovereign Greatneſs we muſt kneel to, and obey. What if a little perjur'd Villain has ſworn a poor Neighbour out of a Cow or a Cottage! hang him, inconſiderable Rogue, his Ears deſerve a Pillory. But to Vow and Covenant, and forſwear three Kingdoms out of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Lives, that's Illuſtrious and Heroick. There's Glory in great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, and Vertue into Succeſs. Alas! a vaſt Imperial <hi>Nimrod</hi> hunts for Nobler Spoils, flies at a whole Nations Property and Inheritance. A Game worthy a Son of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Heir of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> And to lay the mighty Scene of Ruine ſecure, he makes his Coronation Oath, and all his Royal Proteſtations, (thoſe ſplendid Baits of premeditated Perjury) the Cover and Skreen to the hidden fatal Toil laid to inſnare a Nation.</p>
            <p>But now to their main Objection: <hi>Some People will tell us, That 'tis wholly impoſſible for any Popiſh Succeſſour, by all his Arts or Endeavours whatever, to introduce Popery into</hi> England.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, If he's a Papiſt that ſays ſo, he knows he belies his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; for our late Helliſh Plot is a plain Demonſtration, that their whole Party believed it poſſible. For did not the late Secretary St. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords tell us, <hi>That the peſtilent Northern Hereſie was to be rooted out,</hi> and <hi>that now they had as much hopes of accompliſhing that Sacred Work of</hi> Rome, <hi>as they had in Queen</hi> Marys <hi>days?</hi> Could any thing be plainer, than that the ſubtle <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had formed a Deſign to effect it? For it is contrary to Reaſon, and even Nature it ſelf, (as bloody as their Principles are) to think they aim'd at the Life of their King, and would play the Regicides only to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the blackeſt of Murders, for meerly Murders ſake. No: They had the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50753:6"/>
aſſurance under a preſumptive Popiſh Heir, of making a National Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and how little privy ſoever he might poſſibly be to their principal and helliſh Blow, yet they had that perfect in-ſight into the very Soul of a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,</hi> that they were ſatisfied that under that Notion it was impoſſible for him to be otherwiſe than a Man of <hi>Romes</hi> right ſtamp, and their Hearts own liking. And if under ſuch a Succeſſour, their hopes of a Nations Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were equal to thoſe in Queen <hi>Marys</hi> time, no doubt the converting Means muſt have been as Bloody or Bloodier than hers. For if after the ſhort In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of ſeven years Reformation, under the Proteſtant <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's Reign, there wanted Fire and Faggot to reſtore the <hi>Pope</hi>; how much more will he want them for his Reſtoration, after an Excluſion of almoſt Seven-ſcore years together, with all the neceſſary Difficulties of regaining his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, where his Throne has been ſo long demoliſh'd? Nay, in <hi>Edward</hi>'s Days the only deteſtation of the Fopperies, Idolatries, and Superſtitions of <hi>Rome,</hi> was all that went to make a <hi>Proteſtant Reformation.</hi> Alas! the Beaſt was then but young: But his Horns are ſince grown ſtronger, and his Teeth and Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons ſharper? For, ſince that, we have had the notorious <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Maſſacres, when at one riotous Feſtival above 100000 bleeding Proteſtant Hearts were all gorged by the devouring Monſter in a Night. Add to theſe, the ſucceſſive Villanies of Gunpowder-Treaſons, Fired Cities, with Plots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Kings and Kingdoms, which ſerve to heighten the Proteſtant Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency. And if after all this we muſt ſtill be converted, moſt certainly his Holineſs muſt follow <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Example, and heat his Fiery Furnace ſeven times hotter than formerly.</p>
            <p>Thus far we are convinc'd that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> beliv'd it poſſible; and they are too cunning and politick a ſort of People, to be deceiv'd with Shadows, or make Mountains of Mole-hills. And that it may not be objected, <hi>That their Zeal has blinded their Reaſon,</hi> let us but rightly conſider, how far the firſt Foundations of <hi>Popery, (viz. Arbitrary Power)</hi> may be laid in <hi>England.</hi> Firſt, then, if a <hi>Papiſt</hi> Reign, we very well underſtand that the Judges, Sheriffs, Juſtices of the Peace, and all the Judiciary Officers, are of the King's Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And as ſuch, how far may the Influence of Preferment on baſer Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, cull'd out for his purpoſe, prevail even to deprave the very Throne of Juſtice her ſelf, and make our Judges uſe even our <hi>Proteſtant Laws</hi> themſelves to open the firſt Gate to Slavery? Alas! the Laws, in corrupted Judges hands, have been too often uſed as barbarouſly as the Gueſts of <hi>Procruſtes,</hi> who had a Bed for all Travellers; but then he either cut them ſhorter, or ſtretch'd them longer, to fit them to it. Well, but if the Publick Miniſters of Juſtice betray the Liberty of the Subject, the Subject may petition for a Parliament to puniſh 'em for't. But what if he will neither hear one, nor call the other? who ſhall compel him? The intail'd Revenues of the Crown are much larger than his <hi>Popiſh</hi> Predeceſſors e're enjoy'd, notwithſtanding all the Branches of it that terminate with the Life of this preſent King. Beſides, if this will not do, there's no doubt but he'll find ſufficient Aſſiſtance from the <hi>Pope, Engliſh Papiſts,</hi> and Foreign Princes: And then having but a prudent Eye, and a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious Hand, to manage his Exchequer, we ſhall find he'll never call that People he ſhall never have need of. And then where are our Parliaments, and a Redreſs for all the Grievances and Oppreſſions in the World? But all this while the <hi>Pope</hi> is not Abſolute, there wants a Standing Army to crown the Work. And he ſhall have it; for who ſhall hinder him? Nay, all his Commanders ſhall be qualified, even by our preſent Proteſtant Teſt, for the Employment. He ſhall have enough Men of the Blade out of one half of the Gaming-houſes in Town, to Officer twice as many Forces as he ſhall want. 'Tis true, they ſhall be Men of no Eſtates nor Principles; but they ſhall fight
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50753:6"/>
as well as thoſe that have both: For People are ever as valiant that have their Fortunes to raiſe, as thoſe that have them to defend: nay, of the two they ſhall be more faithful to him; for they have no Property to be concern'd for, and will more zealouſly ſerve him, by reaſon their whole Intereſts and Eſtates lie in him. And that this Army may be more quietly raiſed, how many Honourable Pretences may be found? Perhaps the greateſt and moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Preſervation of his Kingdom ſhall call for it; and then, upon ſecond thoughts, in ſtead of defeating ſome Foreign Enemy, they are opportunely ready to cut our Throats at home, if we do not ſubmit, and give all that this King ſhall ask. And then I hope none will deny, but his Revenue may be as great as he and his Popiſh Counſellors ſhall think fit to make it.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have given the Pourtraicture of a <hi>Popiſh King:</hi> And now let us take a Draught of his Features in his Minority; that is, whilſt he is only a <hi>Popiſh Heir Apparent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Imagine then a long and proſperous Reign of a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prince, a Prince ſo excellently qualified, that true Original of Clemency, Goodneſs, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, all the moſt dazling Beams of Majeſty: That with all his Sacred Princely Endowments he renders himſelf ſo true a Vicegerent of Heaven in his Three Kingdoms, ſo near an Image of God in the moderation of his Temper, and the diſpenſation of his Laws, that even the nearneſs of his affinity to Heaven ſhould entitle him to the deareſt Care of it. And to prove him the deareſt Care of Heaven, imagine likewiſe that Heaven has given him a People of thoſe loyal and grateful Principles, looking up with that thankful Allegiance, and kneeling with that humble Veneration to the beſt of Kings, the Authour of their Proſperity, and the Founder of his Kingdoms Glory, that they have made it the greateſt ſtudy of their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to deſerve ſo good a King. Witneſs in all Exigences their cordial ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring their Lives to ſerve him, and ſo far endeavouring to ſtrengthen his Scepter and his Sword, till perhaps they have added thoſe Gems to his Crown, that all his Princely Anceſtors could never boaſt of: Being ſo truly ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in rendring their Purſes and Fortunes his abſolute Votaries, till they have made his Revenue more than trebbly exceed all his Royal Predeceſſors: And not ſtopping here, but upon all occaſions continuing their generous and unwearied Bounty: Nay, that too, not always where his Peoples Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and his Kingdoms Glory, but where his private Satisfaction call'd for it; as if they were reſolved to yield their Hands and Hearts ſo entire a Sacrifice to Majeſty, that they would gratifie even his ſofteſt Wiſhes, ſtudying to ſweeten his Fatigue of Empire with all the Pleaſures of a Throne.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſuppoſe, after a long Tranquillity of this matchleſs Monarch's Reign, That the immediate Heir to his Crown, and a part of his Blood, by the Sorceries of <hi>Rome</hi> is canker'd into a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> And to purſue this Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchape, we ſee this once happy flouriſhing Kingdom ſo far (as in all Duty and Reaſon bound) concern'd for themſelves, their Heirs, and their whole Countries ſafety, till with an honeſt, cautious, prudent Fear they begin to inſpect a Kingdoms univerſal Health; till weighing all the Symptoms of its State, they plainly deſcry thoſe Peſtilential Vapours fermenting, that may one day infect their Air, and ſicken their World; and ſee that riſing Eaſtern Storm engendring, that will once bring in thoſe more than <hi>Egyptian</hi> Locuſts, that will not onely fill their Houſes, and their Temples, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour their Labours, their Harveſts, and their Vintages. Thus they ſo long ſurvey their threatned Countries Danger, till with a more than Prophetick horrour, they manifeſtly diſcover all the inſeparable Concomitants of a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Succeſſour</hi>; and, like true Patriots, anticipate their Woes, with a preſent ſenſe of the future Miſeries they foreſee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:50753:7"/>With theſe juſt Reſentments of their dangerous State, 'tis eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude what follows. What is this <hi>Popiſh Heir</hi> in the Eye of <hi>England,</hi> but perhaps the greateſt and onely Grievance of the Nation, the univerſal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Hate and Fear, and the Subject of their Clamours and Curſes? at whoſe Door lie their Diſcontents and Murmurs; But 'tis Murmurs ſo violent, that they thruſt in amongſt their very Prayers, and become almoſt a part of their Devotions: Murmurs ſo bold, that they dare approach the very Palace, nay Throne and Ear of Majeſty. And whenever the People of <hi>England</hi> reflect on this Heir as their King in Reverſion, they have reaſon to look upon him as no better than <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Stork amongſt the Frogs. Yes, notwithſtanding all his former Glories and Conqueſts, his whole Stock of Fame is ſo loſt and buried in his Apoſtacy from the Religion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Intereſt of theſe Proteſtant Kingdoms, that all his Services are cancell'd, and his whole Maſs of Glory corrupted.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe likewiſe this <hi>Popiſh</hi> Heir for many happy years ſo bleſt in the Tenderneſs and Friendſhip of the beſt of Kings, that there is not that Favour or Honour within the reach or wiſh of Majeſty, that he has not made it the Study of his whole Reign to confer upon him; whilſt his Greatneſs and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre have been ſo much his deareſt darling Care, as if the promoting his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt had been the Support of his own; till in ſhort he has had ſo large a ſhare in the Boſom of this Royal <hi>Pylades,</hi> this kindeſt and moſt gracious of Princes, as if one Soul had animated them both.</p>
            <p>On this Foundation, as great Affections are not eaſily removed, and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy is that Bond which Humane Power can ne'er diſſolve, ſuppoſe more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that this inſeparable Tie continues ſo long, notwithſtanding all the Changes of Principles and Religion, a Byaſs ſo heavy that it almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns a Kingdom: Yet ſtill the force of Nature and Friendſhip ſurmounts them all, and ſtands that zealous unſhaken Bulwark, for the protection and ſafety of this deareſt part of himſelf; till at length he does little leſs than act ſo over-fond a <hi>Pelican,</hi> that he exhauſts even his own Vitals to cheriſh him.</p>
            <p>Thus whilſt the long and lawful Fears of a drooping Nation have fully and juſtly ſatisfied them, that the kindeſt and moſt favourable Aſpect of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty that ſmiles on <hi>England,</hi> thro' the defence and Intereſt of a <hi>Popiſh Heir,</hi> ſhines but like the Sun thro' a Burning-glaſs, whoſe gentleſt morning Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Beams, thro' that fatal <hi>Medium,</hi> do but burn and conſume what other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would warm and cheriſh; what can the Conſequence of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Friendſhip be, but that the very Souls and Loyalties of almoſt a whole Kingdom are ſtaggered at this fatal Conjunction; till I am afraid there are too many, who in deteſtation of that one gangren'd Branch of Royalty, can ſcarce forbear (how undutifully ſoever) to murmur and revile even at that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Root that cheriſhes it? Inſomuch that thoſe very Knees that but now would have bow'd into their very Graves to ſerve him, grow daily and hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo far from bending (as they ought) to a Crown'd Head, till they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſtubborn as their Petitions and Prayers have been ineffectual.</p>
            <p>Thus whilſt a <hi>Popiſh Heir</hi>'s extravagant Zeal for <hi>Rome</hi> makes him ſhake the very Throne that upholds him, by working and incroaching on the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Majeſty for that Protection and Indulgence that gives Birth and Life to the Heart-burnings of a Nation; what does he otherwiſe, than in a manner ſtab his King, his Patron, and his Friend, in his tendereſt part, his Loyal Subjects Hearts? Which certainly is little leſs than to play the more lingering ſort of Parricide; a part ſo ſtrangely unnatural, that even Savages would bluſh at; yet this Religion, incorrigible remorſeleſs Religion, never ſhrinks at.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50753:7"/>Thus whilſt the Univerſal Nerves of a whole ſtrugling Nation bend their united force againſt the Invaſion of Pope and Popery, in ſtudying to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Tyranny, they grow jealous of Monarchy. And fearing leſt their Loyal Aid to the Father of their Country ſhould unhappily contribute to the ſtrengthning of the Subverters of their Peace and Liberty, inſtead of that Tributary gold which once they ſo cheerfully ſhower'd at their dread Soveraign's feet, now on the contrary the protection of a Popiſh Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor makes them ſo far from ſupplying the real and moſt preſſing Neceſſities of Majeſtie, that they are rather well-pleaſed and triumph in his greateſt wants, and that perhaps when his Glory, nay poſſibly when his neareſt Safety calls for their Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Thus what does this Popiſh Heir in tying up the hands of a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from their juſt devotion to their King, but onely this, In return for the accumulated Honours heaped upon him, he moſt inhumanely ſtarves the very hand that fed him. An Ingratitude that even an Infidel would be aſhamed of! But this Religion, incorrigible remorſeleſs Religion, never bluſhes at.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if there can be a Son of that Royal Martyr <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, a Prince ſo truly pious, that his very Enemies dare not aſperſe his Memory or Life with the leaſt blemiſh of Irreligion; a Prince that ſeal'd the <hi>Proteſtant Faith</hi> with his blood; who in his deplorable Fate and ignominious Death, bore ſo near a reſemblance to that of the Saviour's of the World, that his Sufferings can do no leſs than ſeat him at the right hand of Heaven. If, I ſay, there can be a Son of that Royal Proteſtant, of that uncharitable <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> Faith, who by the very Tenets of his Religion dooms all that die without the boſome of their Church irreparably damn'd; then conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he muſt barbarouſly tear up his Fathers ſacred Monument, brand his bleſſed memory with the name of Heretick; and to compleat the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid <hi>Anathema,</hi> he moſt impiouſly execrates the very Majeſtie that gave him being.</p>
            <p>Then in fine, provided and granted that we have an Heir to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Crown of <hi>England</hi> perverted to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith, and conſequently of that depraved conſtitution and principles, that he has neither charity for the Stock from whence he ſprang, concern or care for the ſafety, peace, glory, or proſperity of the beſt of Patrons, Friends, and Kings; nor laſtly, any remorſe for all the Groans of an afflicted Kingdom: What promiſes can we give our ſelves of his future Reign, when we have all theſe fatal Prognoſticks before-hand? <hi>Ex pede Hercules.</hi> Or is it likely he will have greater care and tenderneſs for a Nations peace, when he ſhall be ſeated on a Throne, and have more power to take it from them?</p>
            <p>But ſays a Critick to all this, <hi>Suppoſe this Popiſh Heir undoubtedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves (as a Papiſt must do) that there's no way to Heaven but his own; ſhould he ſo far comply with the glory or interest of his King, though a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or a Brother, on the one ſide, and the quiet and ſafety of a Nation on the other, as to renounce his principles of Chriſtianity, and conform to theirs? What were that, but to purchaſe their peace with his own damnation, and to ſacrifice his own Soul for their worldly intereſts? And certainly neither Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor Allegiance, nor any Tye whatever, ought to extort that from him. And then, if all the grievances of a Kingdom lie at his door, alas, the worst can be ſaid of him is, That if he be any occaſion of it, 'tis his unhappineſs, and not his fault. More eſpecially, provided he is onely paſſive, and that we
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50753:8"/>
plainly ſee, that during his being this Popiſh Heir, he acts nothing that may encourage or favour Popery in the least.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pray, by the way, How muſt it follow, that if we do not plainly ſee him act, that therefore he muſt not act? Does no man act, but he that publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treads the Stage? Does no man ſit at the Helm, but he that viſibly holds the Rudder? Does no wind ſtir the troubled Sea into a Tempeſt, but what the poor Mariners both hear and feel? no Storm, but that which lightens in their Eyes, and thunders in their Ears, to warn 'em 'tis a coming? Alas, alas, the greateſt Hurricanes are onely made by ſubterranean Winds. A ſecret, ſilent, underground-working Mine of Ruine, which never burſts out till it deſtroys, and which no man hears or ſees till he is loſt.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Objection, <hi>The grievance of a Nation may be his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, and not his fault,</hi> &amp;c. That is, in ſhort, he cannot help it. Very right. And ſo when this <hi>Popiſh</hi> Heir comes to the Crown, and promotes the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Intereſt with all the Severity, Injuſtice, and Tyranny, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Cruelty can invent; his anſwer will be, he cannot help it, or at leaſt cannot withſtand thoſe irreſiſtible motives that prompt him to their execution; which is the ſame thing. The injunctions of his Conſcience make him as active now in the ruining a Kingdoms peace, as he was paſſive in it before. For who can be ſo void of common ſenſe, as not to know, that the ſame impulſe of Conſcience that makes a man a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> will make him act like one when opportunity ſerves? And what greater opportunity to eſtabliſh <hi>Popery,</hi> than for a <hi>Papist</hi> to wear a Crown? And tho' perhaps the ſtubborn <hi>Engliſh Genius</hi> will not eaſily bend to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet ſince his Almighty Friend the <hi>Pope,</hi> the undiſputed Keeper of the Keys of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> will no doubt aſſigne him no common Diadem in Heaven for ſo glorious a Taſk as a Nations Converſion, who then will not make that ſacred Work the ſtudy of years, which cannot be accompliſht in a day, for ſuch a Reward? Eſpecially when he has theſe two infallible Arguments to ſpur him on in ſo godly a Cauſe: Firſt then, he is of a Religion that makes humane Merit the path to Salvation. <hi>Merit,</hi> the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Exchequer, <hi>Rome</hi>'s bottomleſs Golden Mine. <hi>Merit,</hi> that makes the frighted dying ſinner ſtarve his own Blood, and pawn his Eſtate, to redeem his Soul. <hi>Merit,</hi> that drains the Wealth of Nations into the prieſtly Coffers, and makes the Luxury of a World the pamper'd riotous Church-mans Inheritance. <hi>Merit,</hi> that can make a <hi>Loretto</hi>-Chappel vie with a <hi>Venetian Arſenal</hi>; and <hi>Rome</hi>'s Altars, Cloyſters, and Covents, riſe ſo high, ſo rich, ſo numerous, and ſo magnificent, tho' the impoveriſht Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows groans, and the naked Orphans cryes, do little leſs towards the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding than a ſecond <hi>Amphion.</hi> Nay, <hi>Merit,</hi> that can conſecrate Daggers, and kill Kings. Thus whilſt he has the Wonder-working <hi>Merit</hi> for his Tutor, what greater and more meritorious act to canonize him a Saint of the firſt magnitude, than the converting of an Apoſtatized Heretical King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</p>
            <p>And then next, he is of a Religion that does not go altogether in the old-faſhion Apoſtolical way of preaching and praying, and teaching all Nations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſcourging, and wracking, and broiling 'em into the fear of God. A Religion that for its own propagation will at any time authorize its Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions to diveſt themſelves of their humanity, and act worſe than Devils, to be Saints. And thus whilſt neither the cries of Blood can deter him on the one ſide, and ſo no Tyranny come amiſs to him; and next, that he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50753:8"/>
has the undeniable aſſurance of the greateſt bleſſings of Eternity to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him on the other; with theſe advantages, who would not be as active as a ſecond <hi>Romulus,</hi> and with all his utmoſt vigour and pride, build up his <hi>Romes</hi> new Walls, tho' he made his neareſt, nay the Nations deareſt blood their Cement?</p>
            <p>And thus what is a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Heir, but the moſt terrible and the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous of <hi>Englands</hi> Enemies, and of all our Foes, has the moſt inflexible invincible Enmity. Nay, the very outrages of Thefts, Murders, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Rebellions, are nothing to the pious Barbarities of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> King. The Murderer and Adulterer may in time be reclaimed by the precepts of Morality, and the terrours of Conſcience. The Thief, by the dread of a Gallows may become honeſt. Nay, the greateſt Traytor, either by the fear of Death, or the apprehenſions of Hell, may at laſt repent. But a <hi>Papiſt</hi> on a Throne has an unconfutable vindication for all his proceedings, challenges a Commiſſion even from Heaven for all his Cruelty dares act. And when the enchantments of <hi>Rome</hi> have toucht his Tongue with a Coal from her Altars, what do his Enthuſiaſms make him believe, but that the moſt ſavage and moſt helliſh Dooms his blinded zeal can pronounce, are the immediate Oracles of God? and all the Apology a poor Nation can expect from him, is, <hi>He cannot help it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I, but</hi> (ſay the wiſeſt Criticks we have met with yet) <hi>if theſe be the dangers of a Popiſh King, why have we not ſuch ſtrong, ſuch potent Laws made before this popiſh Heir come to the Crown, that it ſhall be impoſſible for him ever to ſet up</hi> Popery, <hi>though he ſhould never ſo much endeavour it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer; To endeavour to ſet up Popery by Law, even with the Laws that we have already againſt it, is impoſſible; and therefore the very ſuppoſition of the Projection that way is nonſence. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, to conclude he'll endeavour to do it againſt Law, and ſo to make new Laws on purpoſe for him to break them with their fellows, is worſe nonſence than t'other. Beſides, Who ſhall call this King to queſtion for breaking theſe Laws, if he has the power and will to do it? I fancy that the onely neareſt illuſtration I can make upon this point, in creating new Laws againſt Popery in caſe of a Popiſh Succeſſor, is as politick a piece of work in the kinde, as building the Hedge to fence in the Cuckow. 'Tis true, I will not deny, but a Popiſh King may be totally reſtrain'd from all power of introducing Popery, by the force of ſuch Laws that may be made to tye up his hands; but then they muſt be ſuch as muſt ruine his Prerogative, and put the executive power of the Laws into the hands of the People. If a King of <hi>England</hi> were no more than a <hi>Stadt-holder</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> or a <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> no doubt Popery would have little hopes of creeping into <hi>England</hi>; which is in ſhort, he that is no King, can be no Tyrant. But what Monarch will be ſo unnatural to his own Blood, ſo ill a Defender, and ſo weak a Champion for the Royal Dignity he wears, as to ſign and ratifie ſuch Laws as ſhall entail that effemenacy and that ſervili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on a Crown, as ſhall render the Imperial Majeſty of <hi>England</hi> but a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant, a meer Puppet upon a Wire? If then no King will aſſent to make Laws to do it this way, and no Laws can do it t'other, all Laws againſt Popery, in caſe of a Popiſh Succeſſor, are, as I told you before, but building the Hedge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For indeed, how can the force of Laws made by a Proteſtant
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50753:9"/>
Predeceſſor, and a Proteſtant Parliament, in any ſort binde a Popiſh Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, when the very firſt advance of the Popes Supremacy introduces that higher power, thoſe Canonick Eccleſiaſtick Laws, which no Secular, or any Temporal Court can or may controul? Laws that ſhall declare, not onely all the Statutes and Acts of Parliament made againſt the dignity of Mother Church, void and null, but the very Law-makers themſelves as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, wholly uncapable of ever having any right of making ſuch Laws. No doubt then, but that fire that burns thoſe Heretick Law-makers, ſhall give their Laws the ſame Martyrdom.</p>
            <p>With this certain proſpect, both of the Ruine of their Eſtates, Lives, and Liberties, where lyes the ſin in the Commons of <hi>England</hi> to ſtand upon their guard againſt a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Succeſſor? Aye, a God's name let 'em ſtand upon their guards, and uſe all expedients to keep out <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> provided ſtill that we preſerve the ſacred Succeſſion in its right Line; for that we are told both King and people are obliged in Conſcience to defend and uphold.</p>
            <p>I think I need not inſiſt further in multiplying Arguments to prove how far 'tis impoſſible to do one without the other; but on the other ſide, let us examine how the defending and eſtabliſhing a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Succeſſor, is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation on our Duties or Conſciences.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, let us fancy we ſee this <hi>Popiſh</hi> Heir on his Throne, and by all the moſt illegal and arbitrary means, contrary to the whole frame and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, introducing <hi>Popery</hi> with that zeal and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, till his infatuated Conſcience has perverted the King into a Tyrant. And not to ſtop here, If the Conſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Majeſty makes a King ſupream Moderator and Governour both Eccleſiaſtick and Civil: What does this <hi>Popiſh</hi> King by admitting the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Church-ſupremacy, but diveſt himſelf of half his Royalty, whilſt like the junior King of <hi>Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> in the Play, he reſignes and alienates the right and power of Majeſty to an Invader and an Uſurper? And whilſt we are thus enſlaved by a Medley-Government betwixt Tyranny and Uſurpation, by eſtabliſhing a <hi>Papiſt</hi> on a Throne, we are ſo far from preſerving the Crown, that is, the Imperial Dignity, in a right Line of Succeſſion, that we do not preſerve it at all, but on the contrary extirpate and deſtroy it, whilſt by enthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a <hi>Papiſt</hi> we totally ſubvert and depoſe the very Monarchy it ſelf. And can it be the duty of either <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> or Chriſtians, to have that zeal for a corrupted leprous Branch of Royalty, that we muſt ruine both Religion, Government, and Majeſty it ſelf, to ſupport him? How much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent would it be with the honeſt, prudent, and lawful means of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions preſervation, to take out one link out of the whole Chain of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, than by preſerving that, to break the whole to pieces? Next let us ſee, who 'tis the Commons of <hi>England</hi> would render uncapable of inheriting the Imperial Crown; a Prince of the Royal Blood, nurſt and bred up in the Proteſtant Allegiance and Faith, and afterwards ſeduced and perverted to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> principles and Superſtition. And what's that, but a Prince whom the unanimous Voice both of King and People, (for ſuch are the Laws of <hi>England</hi>) have declared guilty of High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as we finde it in the firſt Statute in the 23<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>If then we have a Popiſh Heir preſumptive, of the ſame brand that theſe Laws have markt him out, I would aſk, what Crime 'tis in the People of <hi>England</hi> to endeavour to diſable a Tyrant from wearing a Crown? Beſides, they conſider they are under a regulated and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Government, a Government where no man ſtands or falls but by his own act and decree; whilſt the whole diſpenſation of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> are made by every mans ſelf, or his Repreſentatives. Since then the People of <hi>England,</hi> as the Lawmakers, are an eſſential part of the Government; and are fully aſſur'd in the Reign of a Papiſt, that Right will be deſtroy'd, Why ſhould not they be as active and vigorous for their own Royal Inheritance, and Sacred Succeſſion of Power, as a King for his? Nay they ought to be the more vigorous of the two. For the King in defending a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Heir, protects but that Succeſſor, whoſe Tyranny he ſhall never live to ſee (ſince it commences but from his Grave); but the People of <hi>England,</hi> in Aſſerting their Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and defending themſelves and their Heirs, do oppoſe that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny which they may both live to ſee and feel. And that they may aſſure themſelves they ſhall feel it, if ever a Papiſt mounts this Throne, then all their Murmurs, their Petitions, Proteſtings, and Aſſociation-Votes will be remember'd to the purpoſe. He that has gone a long and tireſome Journey through Brakes and Briars to a ſplendid Palace, when once in poſſeſſion, will ſend out to Root up all thoſe Thorns, and Weed thoſe Thiſtles that gor'd him in the way. Alas! too ſure he'll make good that old Promiſe of God to the Seed of the Woman, <hi>He'll cruſh their Heads, that bruiſed his Heels.</hi> And would it not be hard, that the Folly and Fall of one Man ſhould renew our old <hi>Adam</hi>'s Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and entail a Curſe on our whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Generation? If the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50753:10"/>
policy of <hi>Rome,</hi> like the old Serpents ſubtilty, has puft him up into an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and luſt of being equal to Gods; may he have <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſucceſs too, whilſt the Proteſtant hearts and hands of <hi>England,</hi> ſtand like the Angels Flaming Sword to expel him from that once Hereditary Paradiſe, which now his Apoſtacy has juſtly forfeited and loſt.</p>
            <p>Beſides, that the Diſinheriting of an Heir to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> may not appear a thing ſo illegal, or indeed ſo monſtrous as ſome people would make it, I would only refer thoſe vehement aſſertors of the invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable right of Succeſſion, to our own Chronicles for their confutation. For they'll find not only the Succeſſion was ſcarce ever kept for Three Kings Reigns together, in a direct line of deſcent, ſince the Conqueſt; but that the Crown and Succeſſion were frequently diſpoſed and ſettled by Acts of Parliament. I ſhall need inſtance but in ſome few particulars. In the 25. of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th,</hi> we find the Parliament ordering the Succeſſion, and enacting, <hi>That the Imperial Crown of this Realm ſhall be to King</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 8th, <hi>and to the Heirs of his body lawfully begotten on Queen</hi> Anne, <hi>and the heirs of the bodies of ſuch ſeveral ſons reſpectively, according to the courſe of inheritance; and for default of ſuch Iſſue, then to the ſons of his body in like manner; and upon failure of ſuch iſſue, then to the Lady</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By the ſame Statute is every ſubject at full age obliged by an Oath to defend the contents of this, and the refuſal made miſpriſion of Treaſon. In the 28<hi>th</hi> year of his Reign, was that Act repealed, and the Parliament entailed the Crown on the Heirs of his Body by Queen <hi>Jane,</hi> the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being both declared illegitimate, the firſt as the Daughter of <hi>Katharine,</hi> formerly his Brothers Wife, and divorced; and the laſt as the Daughter of <hi>Anne Boleign,</hi> atainted of High Treaſon. <hi>And in caſe he died without iſſue, then the Parliament empower'd him by the ſame Act to diſpoſe of the Succeſſion by his own Letters patents, or his laſt Will.</hi> In the 35th year of his Reign the <hi>Parliament granted the Succeſſion to</hi> Edward, <hi>and for want of Heirs of his Body, to the Lady</hi> Mary, <hi>and the Heirs of her Body; and for want of ſuch Heirs, to the Lady</hi> Elizabeth; <hi>but both ſubject to ſuch conditions as the King ſhould limit by his Letters patents, or by his laſt Will ſigned by his Hand; and if the King left no ſuch Conditions by his Will, or under his Letters Patents, then either of them ſhould enjoy the Imperial Crown, with the limitations only made in that Act.</hi> By theſe Acts we may plainly ſee, that the Succeſſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown was wholly ſubjected to the diſpoſal, determinations, and limitations of Parliament. And that we may be well aſſured that that right lay in them, <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th was a Prince of that Wiſdom and Prudence, and ſo far from ſubmitting to Parliaments, that we may be very well aſſur'd, that he would never have complimented them with a power that was not their due. If he had thought in the leaſt that he could have diſpoſed of the Succeſſion himſelf, no doubt but he would have challenged the Prerogative, had he had it to challenge. And as in every one of theſe three Acts they declared that their zeal for ſetling the Succeſſion was for prevention of thoſe miſchiefs, and that blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed that might poſſibly be occaſioned by future diſputes; Here 'tis obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that whilſt they thus bandied the Succeſſion ſo many various ways, by three ſeveral Acts in one Kings Reign, they did not ſo much reſpect the preſervation of the Right Heir, as the Kingdoms ſafety. For had they been ſo paſſionately tender for the next of blood in that Age, as ſome would have us be in this, they would never have excluded the Lady <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:50753:10"/>
and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> from the Crown in one Act, or never have re-admitted them again in another. Beſides, one thing is rema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kable in theſe Acts of Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> The laſt Act of Parliament gives the Succeſſion to thoſe very Ladies whom the King and Parliament had before declared and recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Illegitimate. Nay, they had proceeded ſo far, as to make it Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for any man by Writing or Printing to ſay or declare that either the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> or the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were legitimate; and yet afterwards theſe were no impediments to debar them from a Throne. And <hi>England</hi> was never more bleſt, than under the long and glorious Reign of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> how Illegitimate ſoever ſhe had been rendered. I ſhall onely cite one Act more, and that is the 13 of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> where 'tis made Treaſon <hi>to affirm the Right of Succeſſion of the Crown to be in any other than the Queen; or to affirm that the Laws and Statutes made in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, do not bind the Right of the Crown, and the deſcent, limitation, inheritance, and governance thereof.</hi> If after ſo plain and evident proofs of the undeniable power of Parliaments, we meet ſo many ſnarlers againſt the proceedings of the laſt, I know no excuſe they can make for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but by owning their Ignorance to be as great as their Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>If then (which no man in his right wits can deny) our Religion, Lives, and Liberties are only held by a Proteſtant Tenure, and the Majeſty of <hi>England</hi> not only by the force of his Coronation-Oath, but by all the tyes whatever ought to be the pillar and bulwark of the Proteſtant Faith, and at the ſame time granting that we have a Popiſh Prince to inherit the Imperial Crown of <hi>England,</hi> he ought certainly in all Juſtice as little to aſcend this Throne, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ought to have kept his when the immediate blaſt of Heaven had made him ſo uncapable of ruling as a King, that he was only a companion fit for brutes and ſavages. And if he had no injuſtice done him when he was thruſt out into his proper Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to feed and herd with the Beaſts of the field; a Papiſt Heir of <hi>England,</hi> with that perſwaſion and principles ſo deſtructive to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> State, has as little wrong done him in being debar'd from the Succeſſion, as a fitter Gueſt for a Cloyſter than a Throne. I remember Story tells us, That the Mother of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Son of King <hi>Priam,</hi> dreaming before his birth ſhe had brought forth a Firebrand, that ſhould one day ſet their <hi>Troy</hi> in flames; immediately upon this, the afflicted King, as a true Father of his Country, notwithſtanding all the compunctions of Nature, and tyes of Blood, was ſo far from cheriſhing even his own Race, and a Branch of himſelf, that he ordered the Infant to be brought up amongſt Swains, as the Son of a Shepherd; where diveſted of all his Princely Fortunes, and ignorant of his own high Blood, he ſhould end his days in ignoble obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And all this out of the prophetick horror but of a dream, that ſeemed to threaten the peace and ſafety of his Kingdom. And how much more reaſon has the preſent power of <hi>England,</hi> for effectually oppoſing Popery, by diſinheriting a Popiſh Succeſſor, when under a Popiſh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, our <hi>Troynovant</hi> has the undeniable aſſurance of being put into a flame; when <hi>Priams</hi> fear was but a Dream? How fabulous ſoever this Story may appear, yet I am certain we have too much reaſon to eſteem the Moral of it Oraculous. And ſurely our preſent greateſt Sticklers for an unbroken Succeſſion of the Crown, muſt of all Mankind ſet but a very little price upon their Countrey, and conclude our <hi>England</hi> the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable part of Chriſtendom, when the intereſt of one man ſhall out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50753:11"/>
that of Three Kingdoms, with the whole ſafety of Religion itſelf, and the Glory of God to fill up the Ballance. But indeed they are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be poſitive; and be the next of Blood a Papiſt or a Mahumetan, yet if he be born to it, let him Govern us. And truely I cannot forbear to repeat one of their commoneſt Arguments, and as they think ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt; which is, <hi>If the Son of a private Gentleman, though a Papiſt, ſhall inherit and quietly poſſeſs his hereditary Eſtate; is it not hard, nay barbarous Injuſtice, That the Son of a King, and the Heir of a Crown, ſhould loſe his Patrimony of Three Kingdoms for being a Papiſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though this Argument, as <hi>Argumentum à Fortiori,</hi> has mighty ſound in't; yet how feeble will it appear, when the Analogy ſhall be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd!</p>
            <p>The Papiſt Gentleman that's born to an Eſtate, may peaceably inherit it; yes, and with ſome reaſon for it: For he's a Subject of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Kingdom, and as ſuch, has Proteſtant Laws to rule him. He can neither force his Neighbour or his Tenant to Maſs, or impriſon or burn 'em for Hereticks, nor ſeize their Eſtates as forfeited to <hi>Rome,</hi> whilſt he is a Papiſt. His Religion is only to himſelf, and if he takes any violent or unlawful courſe to propagate his own Perſwaſion, he's not ſo big but he may be brought into <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> to anſwer for it. Nay, poſſibly the Papiſt Subject under a Proteſtant Government, may ſometimes behave himſelf as a more harmleſs and quiet Common-wealths-man, than a Proteſtant himſelf, if for no other than his own preſervation, as not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to awaken that Juſtice that may inflict the penal Statutes againſt him for his Recuſancy.</p>
            <p>But how directly contrary to all this is the influence of a Romiſh Heir, when there is not one of all theſe deſtructive qualities (of which a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man can ne're be guilty) that he on the other ſide ſhall not vigorouſly and undoubtedly put in execution, when once the acquiſition of a Crown has Enabled him for it, as we have at large diſcourſed before? And if the Princely Popiſh Heir be diſinherited, when a private Gentleman eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes, 'tis not for his Religion, for that may be alike in both; but for his uncontrolable power of eſtabliſhing that Religion, which a Royal ſtation will inevitably give him.</p>
            <p>Alas, the Proteſtant ſtrength is above the fear of any little Popiſh Beaſts of prey: It only behoves their ſafety, to hunt the Imperial Lyon down.</p>
            <p>If then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood boils ſo high, and the acceſs of a Papiſt to a Throne muſt neceſſarily meet a paſſage ſo difficult, with all theſe ſolid Bars between; if his Religion were as Honourable as 'tis invincible, what deathleſs Fame, and what eternal Trophies might a Popiſh Heir atchieve, if the welfare of a King and Kingdoms could ſo far influence him, as freely of himſelf to make the union of King and people a work of his own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by ſlacking the fatal ſtrength of a too generous Brothers over-vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Friendſhip; and ſo rendring our univerſal peace his inclination, and not neceſſity?</p>
            <p>I remember in the old <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, when a long Plague had reigned in <hi>Rome,</hi> and an Earthquake had opened a prodigious Gulph in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the <hi>Forum,</hi> their <hi>Conſulteo Oracle</hi> told 'em, that neither the Plague ſhould be ſtopt, nor the breach cloſed, till the moſt noble Victim in <hi>Rome</hi> had appeaſed their angry Deity. When <hi>Curtius,</hi> a Noble Youth of <hi>Rome,</hi> of the beſt and higheſt <hi>Roman</hi> quality, moſt princely adorn'd, and moſt gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly mounted on Horſeback, with a look ſo gay and ſo cheerful, more like
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50753:11"/>
that of a Bridegroom than a Sacrifice, amidſt a thouſand wondering ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der eyes around him, rode headlong into the yawning pit. Thus falling, unterrified at ſo dreadful a precipice for his Countries deliverance, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted the promiſe of the Oracle; for the Peſtilence ceaſed, and the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Earth ſealed up his Grave.</p>
            <p>The voluntary reſignation of a Popiſh Heir, would be no leſs a ſignal National ſervice in the preſent exigence of <hi>England,</hi> than that of <hi>Curtius</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi>; only 'tis attended with milder circumſtances. Our State, as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as it is, does not require any Sanguinary Sacrifice: The Cure he might make to all our plagues, would be only the eaſier oblation of quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the doubtful proſpect of a remote and Craggy Throne; and that too, to refix a ſhaking Crown, to regain the hearts of a whole Nation, and build himſelf that Pyramid of Honour, which would outſhine the wearing a Diadem.</p>
            <p>Beſides, let Plotting but once end, and the Pendant Sword, which like that of <hi>Damocles,</hi> hangs but by a Hair o're our Soveraigns Head, be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheath'd, and give Nature fair play, the little diſparity of their years conſidered, the reſigning of a Crown in all humane probability, would not appear at ſo much diſtance, and ſuch uncertainty, altogether ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant an offering, eſpecially when 'tis made for a King and Brothers ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and glory, a Kingdoms peace and proſperity; nay indeed, the whole repoſe of Chriſtendom, when the concordance of the King and Parliament is the greateſt means for ſtrengthening thoſe Forreign Alliances, that may give check to the fatal growth of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, above all this, what Immortal Glory would it bring even to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Religion it ſelf, when a Prince ſo immediately Allied to a Crown, ſhall voluntary lay aſide the hopes and pretenſions to a Temporal Diadem, for an Immortal one? And how many more, at leaſt more Hearty Converts would ſo tranſcendent an example of piety make, beyond the utmoſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer influence of a Throne? Nay, I may even without flattery ſay, the deed would make him ſo adorable, that for loſing a Crown, he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt raiſe himſelf an Altar.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Rome</hi> (Heaven knows) has other work in hand; ſhe'll have no proſelytes of that kind of Creation; her rode of Converſion, I aſſure you, lies quite another way: Beſides, her Champions are not made of ſo pure and ſo refin'd an <hi>Oar,</hi> their <hi>Minerals</hi> are more courſe, and more allay'd. Her Saints, in ſpight of all their Heavenly Contemplations, have ſtill ſo much of Earth about them, that like the feet of <hi>Daniels</hi> Image, they are a mixture between Iron and Clay.</p>
            <p>But to ſum up all; If no reaſon muſt or ſhall prevail, and that right or wrong a Papiſt muſt ſucceed, when all the inſeparable Cruelties of Pope and Popery ſhall ſurround us; ſuppoſe the worſt that may be, that the dreadful approach of certain ſlavery, ſo oppoſite to the free born genius of <hi>England,</hi> has exaſperated them into a ſpirit of Rebellion; what is it but the peſtilential Air of reigning Popery, that bloats and ſwells them into that Contagion? And if the Popiſh King ſummons all his Thunder to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh 'em for't, what can the greateſt favourer of <hi>Rome</hi> make more on't, than that he warps them crooked, and then breaks 'em to pieces becauſe they are not ſtraight? And what's the whole ſum of a revolting Nation under a Popiſh Tyrant, but uſing a violent cure to expel an univerſal poyſon?</p>
            <p>But here will ſome pretended pious Objectors ſay, <hi>How ſhall we dare to Revolt? Remember we are Chriſtians, and we muſt obey, or at leaſt yield a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50753:12"/>
paſſive obedience to our King; be his Religion, Principles, or Government never ſo Tyrannick, he is ſtill the Lords Anointed, and our native Soveraign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would ask what this Lords Anointed is? and who 'tis is our Native Soveraign, when inſtead of being free Subjects, Pope and Tyranny ſhall rule over us, and we are made Slaves and Papiſts? We are bound indeed by our Oaths of Allegiance, to a conſtant Loyalty to the King and his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Succeſſours. Very right; by that Oath we are bound to be his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Succeſſours Loyal Subjects; but why his Loyal Slaves? Or how is an Arbitrary abſolute Popiſh Tyrant, any longer a lawful Succeſſour to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant eſtabliſht and bounded Government, when lawfully ſucceeding to this limited Monarchy, he afterwards violently, unlawfully, and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally over-runs the due bounds of power, diſſolves the whole Royal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Three Free States of <hi>England,</hi> and the Subjects Petition of Right? Whilſt wholly abandoning thoſe Reins of Government which were his lawful birthright, and making new ones of his own illegal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he makes us neither thoſe Free-born Subjects we were when we took that Oath, nor himſelf that King we ſwore to be Loyal to. But alas! that Bugbear <hi>paſſive obedience</hi> is a notion crept into the world, and moſt zealouſly, and perhaps as ignorantly defended. There never wanted the authority even of Holy Writ itſelf on all occaſions to vindicate every thing; and there's ſcarce a precedent in the oldeſt Hiſtorick part of the Bible, that ſhall not by an extorted Application, be appropriated even to the duty and neceſſity of all ages, places, and conſtitutions of the world. For example, <hi>They'll tell you that the Prophet</hi> Samuel <hi>makes this anſwer to the</hi> Jews <hi>that deſired a King, That he would make their Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Slaves, and give their Fields, their Vineyards, and their Olive-yards,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to his Servants, and all this and much more they muſt expect from a King,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And ye ſhall cry out in that day, becauſe of your King that you have choſen, and the Lord will not hear you in that day. Which was as much, as if the Prophet had ſaid, If a King ſhall, as he may do this, you have no redreſs but to your Prayers for his converſion, and they perhaps too ſhall not be hear'd.</hi> He does not tell them they might revolt or rebel to redreſs themſelves; no, Heaven forbid he ſhould. For what was the King they deſired, but like thoſe of the Nations about them? And what were thoſe Kings but Abſolute? In their own breath lay the voice of the Laws, and <hi>Sic volo ſic Jubeo</hi> was a Decree or Statute; and if they voluntarily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and vowed Allegiance to a King ſo abſolute, and ſo Arbitrary, as ſuch they ought to obey him. And as they freely would run all risks of whatever might follow, it was their own choice, and <hi>Volenti non fit Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi> Here indeed a paſſive obedience was due; but what's this to a King of <hi>England?</hi> 'Tis not here, <hi>Sic volo ſic Jubeo,</hi> here 'tis firſt <hi>ſic vult populus,</hi> and then comes <hi>ſic jubet Rex.</hi> Here all our Laws and Decrees by which we are govern'd, are of the peoples choice; firſt made by the Subject, and then confirm'd by the King. Here a King cannot take our Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or our Fields and Vineyards away, unleſs we pleaſe to give him them.</p>
            <p>If the Three States of <hi>England,</hi> which we ſuppoſe the whole Body of <hi>England</hi> lawfully convened in Parliament, ſhall ſubmit to ſuch an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Majeſty, to have their <hi>Magna Charta</hi> aboliſht, their Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties deſtroyed, and to have Popery and Arbitrary power ſet up, and yield to have the Right of Lords and Commons extirpated, and all devolve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King, ſo that like the old Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he may ſet up Idols and molten Calves, and make us bow down and worſhip 'em; if they will do
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50753:12"/>
all this, then indeed we are his lawful Slaves, and as ſuch, 'tis our duty to pay him an entire, undiſputed obedience.</p>
            <p>I would only beg the world ſeriouſly to conſider how Monarchy itſelf is acquired and founded, and then the duty of Subjects will be more eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Monarchy can be acquired but Two ways.</head>
               <p>Firſt, by the choice of the People, who frequently in the beginning of the World, out of the natural deſire of Safety, for the ſecuring a peaceful Community and Converſation, choſe a Single Perſon to be their Head, as a proper Supream Moderator in all differences that might ariſe to diſquiet that Community. Thus were Kings made for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and not the people for the King.</p>
               <p>The other acquiſition of Monarchy, was by Conqueſt. The glory and pleaſure of Reigning grew ſo tempting, that (eſpecially in later Ages) they ſpur'd on Ambitious Minds to obtain that by Force, which in the Infancy of Time, and the firſt Original of Nations, appears to be generally the People's Choice, and not Compulſion.</p>
               <p>However, whether Choice or Compulſion, yet after poſſeſſion, and the Peoples Submiſſion, the Right of Kings is Sacred.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Now Conqueſt is Twofold.</head>
               <p>The firſt ſort is, where the Conquerour wholly over-runs a Nation, or People, and like thoſe that take Towns by Storm, deſtroys and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populates, kills or enſlaves; and then eſtabliſhes Religion, Rights and Laws, ſolely at the will of the Conquerour.</p>
               <p>The other kinde is, when the vanquiſht come to Capitulate before they yield, and only Surrender upon terms.</p>
               <p>Such was our laſt <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, when the Inhabitants of <hi>Kent,</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>London</hi> upon a Parley, prevailed with him (as our Records atteſt) to confirm their Cuſtoms and Rights, eſtabliſh'd and granted them by <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſour; whilſt the Lenity of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, contenting himſelf with no larger a Prerogative than their laſt <hi>Saxon</hi> King had poſſeſt before him, ſubmitted to make their own Native Common Laws of <hi>England</hi> the Standard of his Juſtice, and the continuation of their Antient Priviledges the Cement of their new Allegiance.</p>
               <p>In this milde Channel ran the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy, till in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was Confirm'd; which indeed was but a Monumental Regiſter of the Liberties and Immunities of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, enjoyed before (tho' not ſo fixt) in their pious <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign. In this ſtate has the Majeſty of <hi>England,</hi> the Dignity of Parliaments, and the Liberty of the People (bating their former Servility to <hi>Rome</hi>) continued ever ſince. And if now at laſt Popery muſt and ſhall come in, (as by Law it cannot) and conſequently muſt be reſtored by Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power: If a new Monarchy, then a new Conqueſt; and if a Conqueſt, Heaven forbid we ſhould be ſubdued like leſs than Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; or debar'd the Common Right of all Nations, which is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and repel an Invader if we can.</p>
               <p>But to ſum up all this, I muſt ſay, the moſt vehement Diſputants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Peoples Right of defending themſelves, muſt at leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thus much, that whenever a Popiſh King ſhall by Tyranny eſtabliſh the Pope's Juriſdiction in <hi>England,</hi> undoubtedly in the Eye of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50753:13"/>
God he is guilty of a greater Sin, than that people can be, that with open Arms oppoſe that Tyranny. For by introducing Popery by Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, by one unjuſt Power he eſtabliſhes another as unjuſt; and by one ill, defends a worſe: Whereas the People of <hi>England,</hi> in taking Arms againſt that Tyranny, defend a juſt Right, <hi>viz.</hi> their Religion, Lives and Liberties.</p>
               <p>Thus when a Popiſh <hi>Monarch</hi> ſhall ſubvert all Right, and violate all Laws, till oppreſſing a wretched Nation, more like a <hi>Lupus Agri</hi> than <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> he ſo wholly perverts the Duty of his great Office, and defaces in himſelf the neareſt Image of a Deity, by ſo falſly repreſenting his Vice-gerent: Imagine on the other ſide, a perſecuted deplorable People, even abandon'd by God, and ſo exaſperated by Injuſtice, till they ſtruggle againſt the Yoak, and the Horrour of this <hi>Gorgon</hi> in ſpight of all their Native Duty, has hardned 'em into diſobedience, and then what can a poor Nation expect but Vengeance and Deſtruction? If this be our Rod of Iron, this the King ordain'd to Rule over us, What ſignifies all our long pudder about a Plot? Give the Papiſts that point, and allow them all they dare ask, that there neither is nor has been any Popiſh Plot: That the Evidence are perjur'd, and that <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Letters, <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Murder, and <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s dying Atteſtations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are nothing to the purpoſe: Grant this and twice as much more, yet allowing at the ſame time, that Providence has decreed us a Papiſt and a Bigot for a King; no matter then for Plotters, Jeſuits, or Ruſſians: The very eſſence of a Popiſh Succeſſor is the greateſt <hi>Plot</hi> upon <hi>England</hi> ſince the Creation. A <hi>Plot</hi> of God himſelf to ſcourge a Nation, and make three Kingdoms miſerable. As for the other <hi>Plot,</hi> what was it but a ſecret Confederacy between a handful of feeble Villains, the Limbs of the Roman <hi>Hydra?</hi> But, alas! With all their Deſigns they were but Men, and as ſuch we have ſeen them both detected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if we are predeſtined for a Romiſh Government, that's a <hi>Plot</hi> indeed, a Deſigne form'd by the irreſiſtible Decrees of Heaven, either for our Sins, or what cauſe to it ſelf beſt known, to lay a groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Country in ruine. Nay the Ruine is ſo univerſal, we muſt give it no bounds. For upon the Suppoſition of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Heir, we muſt not conclude that 'tis only the poor diſtreſſed <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that ſhall feel the ſmart, and ſtand the mark of Slavery and Martyrdom. A <hi>Popiſh</hi> King has that peſtilential Influence, that he blaſts even the very party he ſmiles upon, and entails a Curſe upon his deareſt darling Favourites. As for Inſtance, if after this King's Reign, ſteps up a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prince (for ſurely the whole Royal Blood muſt not all follow his Apoſtacy, and degenerate <hi>in ſecula ſeculorum</hi>) then what becomes of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Intereſt in the next Generation, and all that flouriſhing party, whom either the Witchcrafts of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Contagion of <hi>Regis ad exemplum</hi> has nurſt up for mine? 'Tis the greateſt toyl of the next King's Reign, to make thoſe ſeverer Statutes for future Ages, to ſuppreſs the Inſolencies and Follies of the paſt; whilſt thoſe very Idols, that were Saints but yeſterday, are now cruſht and daſht to pieces.</p>
               <p>Thus a Popiſh King undoes at once the Heretick party in his own Reign, and the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> in the next: And then who is it, that he either does or can make happy? Why nothing but an Atheiſt, he that believes there is no God, and ſo makes the name of the moſt faſhionable Religion, the Bawd to his Pleaſures and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments; or at beſt that Latitudinarian Believer, that can kneel to a Crucifix to day, and burn it to morrow. This and this onely Principle, can be ſafe under a Papiſt; and theſe are the only men that in their right wits ought to be unconcern'd at the danger of a Popiſh Succeſſour.</p>
