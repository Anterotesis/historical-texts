            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

After the example therefore of that ſo notable a perſonage, my ſelfe will giue thankes to the miſeries of this time, becauſe that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing me to become a Philoſopher in a ſtrange land, they haue wrought me this good, to haue paſſed away eight or nine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths in the companie of the Lord De la None.

Howbeit the thing that made me moſt deſirous of his friendſhippe, was a conſideration that the farther he was through his afflictions driuen out of France and from your Maieſtie, the more did his affection to your ſeruice &amp; the welfare of the whole Realme ſeeme to increaſe: for whether he walkt or ſlept all his imaginations tended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to the finding out of ſuch meanes as might beſt redreſſe the calamities that oppreſſed our miſerable Countrie, and his ordinarie deuiſes to the ſeeking out of anie thing that might aduance the reeſtabliſhing of the ſtate in her former

Injoying therefore that ſweete familiaritie wherewith it pleaſed him to honour mee, and being on a time in his cloſet I chaunced to laie my hand vpon a heape of papers throwen aſide in a corner, as things not regarded, and finding that they deſerued to bee more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently gathered together, I began very gladly to reade them ouer: but he would not ſuffer me, ſaying they were but ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings whereon he had employed the moſt tedious houres of his leaſure during his long and ſtraight impriſoment: likewiſe that among them there was nothing worth the ſight, becauſe his continuall exerciſe in warrefare wherein he had employed himſelfe, had denied him all opportunitie to endite well, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that in theſe diſcourſes eſpeciallie (as neuer meaning other than to paſſe awaie the time) he had taken no paines with the poliſhing or filing of them, &amp; that he was determined neuer to take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hand again: ſo as at that inſtant I could not obtain anie thing of him.

commodiouſly then he could haue done in his full libertie: which verifieth my ſaying in the beginning viz that <hi>the things which wee doe moſt feare and thinke to bee our greateſt harme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doe ſometimes turne vs to greater proſperitie and good.</hi> For ſo much of our bodily eaſe as afflictions do take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, ſo much ſtrength and reſolution doe they adde vnto our ſoules, whereas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe there is no courage ſo valiant or forcible but proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie will weaken and extenuate, witneſſe <hi>Mecenas,</hi> who as Sencca ſaith, had bene one of the chief men in the world if too much eaſe had not gelded him: for he vſeth that worde to ſhewe how ſore vertue is weakened through too much felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And in deede if the outward apparance or common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion did not dazle our eyes, wee ſhould perceiue that thoſe whome God doth moſt rigorouſly chaſtiſe in this worlde, are often times the ſame whom he moſt ſweetly inſtructeth: alſo that the calamities wherewith hee afflicteth them are not in deede any calamities. But like as it is a pleaſure to behold two good Fencers trying each other, and employing whatſoeuer their actiuitie or knowledge well to aſſaile and better to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend: euen ſo doth the Lord delight to make thoſe whom he hath endued with moſt graces, to fight and withſtand the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt aduerſities, and to exerciſe their vertue by diuers profes, the which the more violent that they bee, the more doe they ſhewe forth the weakneſſe and ſmall effects of all whatſoeuer that we call euill fortune againſt a valiant hart armed with the feare of God. And who hath more practiſed this then your ſelfe Sir, or who is able to ſhew better tokens hereof. But leaſt I ſhould paſſe my boundes, I will ſpeake only of our author, whoſe example may be a ſufficient proofe of the ſaying of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca. That an honest man cannot eſchue aduerſities, although he may well conquer and ouercome them.</hi> And notwithſtanding ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ſeemeth in the ſight of the ignorant to be wretched or vnhappie, yet in the middeſt of all his miſhappes he ſtil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth perfect felicitie which hath ſworne ſo loyall amitie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that whatſoeuer chaunceth him yet is ſhe ſtill about him, with him and in him, and doth vpholde his ſoule in ſo pleaſant a ſeate, that in whatſoeuer eſtate ſhe be, ſhe is ſtill like vnto her ſelfe, as being lifted vp ſo high aboue all accidents of humaine affayres, that ſhe can in no wiſe be by them taynted. But to returne to that which I firſt began to ſpeake of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:8683:6"/>
the commoditie of this booke, ſuch eſpetially as ſhall hereafter vndertake to write the hiſtorie of our time may find great profite therin, and learne how to put in practiſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Tacitus, who willeth that neither loue nor hatred take any holde of the Hiſtoriographers pen. For they ſhall ſee, that notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding our authors long empriſonment, yet he doth in ſundrie places ſpeake honorably of the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> alſo in matter concerning our ciuill warres, he vſeth ſuch ſinceritie in the liuely deſcription of the trueth, that he rather noteth the faults of that ſide where vnto himſelfe leaned, then of the others: and commendeth in thoſe againſt whome he bare arms, anything that he findeth worthie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly as the deſarts of thoſe on whoſe ſide he fought: in ſuch maner that our age may thinke it ſelf happie, that in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of her moſt furious paſsions and partialities, ſhe could recouer this platforme of obſeruations of the hiſtorie, therby exempted from the vniuerſal contagion of hatred &amp; fauor. As alſo it is to be hoped that this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple may wake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry others, who ſeeing how agreeable a voyce the ſame that is ruled by reaſon, is, in reſpect of taunts and inuectiues full of bitternes which (as the ſmall belles of the <hi>Choribantes)</hi> are good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to trouble the moſt ſettled braynes, will endeuour in their writings to ſet forth that which God may haue giuen them for the inſtruction of the poſteritie, rather then the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie of diſordinate affections, whereof our age reapeth but too much reproach and hurt. I will ſtrayne my ſelfe no farther in the perticuler ſetting downe of the fruits that may be reaped in this booke, as well for common commoditie as priuate benefite, for they doe ſufficiently appeare of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Howbeit, in as much as it may ſo fall out that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, conſidering what ſmall accompt hee made of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, in liew of reioycing in the commendations that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhall redound vnto him, may finde fault that I haue thus publiſhed them of mine owne head, and withall that I haue therevnto ſet his name, which hee choſe rather to make fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous by armes, as thinking it (according to the auncient er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the <hi>French</hi> Nobilitie) no honor that men ſhould know how farre he honoreth or eſteemeth of learning; either els vpon ſome perticuler hatred againſt this booke, as ſtill put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him in minde of his captiuitie, I doe preſume <hi>Sir,</hi> moſt
<pb facs="tcp:8683:7"/>
humbly to beſeech your Maieſtie to aduowe my doings, and to bee my warrant in this that I haue preferred the publique commoditie before the perticuler deſire of the Lorde of <hi>la Noüe,</hi> who although hee bee but a bad valewer of his owne workes, is neuertheleſſe ſo affectionate a ſeruant vnto you, that he can no way miſlike any thing that hee ſhall finde to like you: as alſo to the ende that <hi>France</hi> receiuing this booke as it were at your hands, and adioyning the authors deſart to your aucthoritie, may loue and credite it the better. True it is that the ouer vehement mindes ſhall not finde theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes to their appetities. For ſo farre are they from fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their paſsions, that in deede their only ſcope tendeth to the aboliſhing of the ſame. But all thoſe that doe in pietie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this poore ſtate fallen from her ancient felicitie: all thoſe that mourne becauſe <hi>France,</hi> which was wont to be the terror of the whole world, is now become a reproach to the ſame: all thoſe that are wearie of bathing their ſwords in the blood of their brethren, parents, and friends: To be briefe, all good Frenchmen that bee good ſeruaunts to the King and his Crowne, will take great delight when they ſhall ſee their good entents aduanced forwarde with ſuch holy and wiſe aduices as they ſhall finde in this booke. For the author hereof hath not after the maner of ſome both auncient and late Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers waſted his time in forging an Idea of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topian</hi> perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but hath onely ſtudied ſo to accommodate himſelfe to our taſt and diſpoſition, and propounded his counſailes with ſo euident a facilitie and profite, that if wee profite not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, whether in publique or priuate, wee can blame none but our owne ſtubborneſſe and negligence. For in my opinion that man ſhall bee ouer farre out of taſte of all good reading, that ſhall not in theſe diſcourſes perceiue a ſpirite free from all paſsions and partialities, dedicated wholy to the honor of God, the ſeruice of his King, and the peace of his Countrie. This is it that hath embouldened me to offer them vnto you Sir, thinking that as well in conſideration of their argument, as in reſpect of the great bonds wherein the author ſtandeth your moſt bounden, they doe by right apperteyne vnto you. Not daring therefore to paſſe the ſtrict prohibition whereby my inſufficiencie forbiddeth mee to offer any thing of my owne, I do moſt humbly deſire your Maieſtie to receiue them
<pb facs="tcp:8683:7"/>
as ſome acknowledgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of my vowed ſeruice. And I beſeech God Sir after ſo many deaths wherewith you haue bene beſet euen from your infancie, from which he hath preſerued you, to graunt vnto you a long &amp; moſt happie life in perfect peace and aſſured tranquilitie, to the glory of his moſt bleſſed name, the honour of your Maieſtie, and the contentaiton of all good French men your faithfull and affectionate ſeruants.</p>

happened, either to confeſſe that the foundations of the ſame are ſhaken: but it were their dueties rather to mourne then to diſpute and replye againſt ſo viſible and ſenſible apparances of ſubuertion. For the moſt part of the rootes of this ſo great trée doe lye bare and halfe withered: many of the braunches are dead: fewe leaues doe remaine, and the fruite is growne almoſt wilde. And to all this infirmitie haue tyme together with the late miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps brought it. Their beſt therefore were to confeſſe the truth, &amp; to their powers to labour to mainteyne ſo much of it as is yet good &amp; in ſtrength and force. I knowe that the foretelling of the falles, which cannot be done without laying open the ſhame ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, will ſeeme but an vnpleaſant diſcourſe to him that loueth and honoreth his countrie and nation. But ſeeing ſuch perils doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie aſtoniſh ſo many hearts; alſo that the cauſes which plunge vs therein doe appeare in all mens eyes, were it not a great co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlineſſe in this vrgent neceſſitie to ſit ſtill and ſay nothing? True it is that many men through default of good intelligences doe ſtand halfe amazed in the middeſt of all theſe miſeries. And like as the inſenſible waters doe runne downe the riuers vntill they fall into the Ocean wherein they bee buryed, euen ſo thoſe men by little and little rowling themſelues into the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions which carie them away, being deſtitute of right vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, doe goe forwarde, one after another vntill they fall headlong into the gulfe of deſtruction. It is a profitable peece of worke, when a houſe is on fire to ſhewe it to thoſe that ſee it not: likewiſe to vrge ſuch as ſee it and feare it, to helpe to quench it: alſo to admoniſh other ſuch as without any great conſideration do peraduenture kindle it, that they do not well: to be briefe, to exhort euery one to helpe the maiſter of the houſe for the ſafegard thereof, together with the preſeruation of his whole familie.</p>
               <p>Sundrie Philoſophers in their writings haue ſet downe the cauſes of tranſlations and alterations of eſtates, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Politiques, who likewiſe haue touched the meanes how to preſerue the ſame: wherin they haue bene ſo diligent and curious as to procéede euen to the ſmalleſt cauſes, whereof whoſoeuer would perticulerly diſcourſe, had néede of tongue enough. But becauſe wee are in greater neceſſitie of the truth then of wordes, my counſaile is that we goe and drawe it out of the true philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie where we ſhall finde it more liuely painted foorth then in any other doctrine whatſoeuer.

Can we not be content with aboue 200000. men of warre periſhed through the furie of theſe diuiſions? Was there euer more terrible Sacrifices then theſe?

Come therefore, let vs take and enioye the goods that are here, and vſe the creature lightly, as in our youth.

Neuer did any auncient Hiſtoriographer write that it was (any thing néere) ſo common in any age as it is at this day. If wee conſider the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> nation, we ſhall finde them but ſmally taynted therewith, for whoſoeuer among them did blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, he was ſtoned to death.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8683:12"/>
ſuch as becauſe they haue many bookes, and haue ſeene their cloſures and red their titles, doe weene themſelues to be learned: for they looking ſuperficially onely into the cauſes doe neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the principall things that bring miſerie and diſorders into whole Countries, are ſuch offences as are committed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt <hi>God:</hi> notwithſtanding, they ſee that where the Magiſtrates do looke that his holy name be had in reuerence, the Commonwelths doe floriſh and abound in all wealth: but if they ſhewe themſelues negligent therein, the ſcourge ſhall neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from their houſe: neither ſhall it ſtand them in any ſtead to ſay: <hi>I will for my part rule my tongue well enough:</hi> for they be ordeyned, not for themſelues only, but alſo for the inſtruction and correction of others.

Let them therefore doo all that they can and employe their whole power to baniſh this euill, leaſt by ſupporting it they make themſelues guiltie therof.</p>
               <p>The third vice that dependeth vpon <hi>Impietie</hi> is not ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <note place="margin">Of Magicke and ſundrie ſorts of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, the 3. braunch of Impietie.</note> or euident as the former, notwithſtanding it bee as abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in the ſight of <hi>God.</hi> For when the vnlawfull meanes of <hi>Diuinations</hi> and <hi>Magick</hi> arts haue alienated man from <hi>God,</hi> they plunge him in ineuitable deſtruction. Herein doth the deuill vſe two kindes of ſnares.

them into euerlaſting deſtruction. The ſame Author reporteth that their Captaine being taken in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme of <hi>Charles the</hi> 9. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Such as are more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually wiſe and haue in them ſome ſeedes of pietie, muſt haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pollicies that may beare ſome fayrer ſhewe to bring them into theſe pathes of perdition: for if any man ſhould at the firſt ſhewe them the diſhonor that they commit againſt <hi>God,</hi> it may be they would refrayne themſelues: but as the ſleights of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill are merueilous, ſo doth he drawe them on by fayrer preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, vntil they find themſelues ſo ſnared that they cannot eſcape. The cauſe of theſe mens miſhap conſiſteth in their corrupted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which driue them by vnlawfull and damnable waies to ſeeke their accompliſhment. One would knowe what ſucceſſe he ſhould haue in ſome great enterprize: another how he might eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chue ſome euident daunger: The couetous and ambitious man muſt know how to atteyne to his deſires: he that hateth and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to doe harme, the like: One ſeekes to lengthen his life, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſhunne death: This man deſireth to know the iſſue of the warre: that man whether the eſtate may be preferued: with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite other ſuch things as mans imagination can conceiue.

               <p>Now muſt wee ſpeake of <hi>Vniuſtice,</hi> which is a publicke and <note place="margin">Iniuſtice, the ſecond cauſe of the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwelths.</note> particuler oppreſſion vſed by ſuch as bee in auctoritie or mightie ouer the poore and weake, who alſo through their pride, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe and wealth doe practize all violence, deceipt and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie againſt the ſimple.

Thus haue we procéeded from yeare to yeare in ſo wofull an eſtate, that without ſpeedie remedie <hi>France</hi> muſt growe halfe deſert. Then if we marke the men of lawe which are ordeyned to miniſter iuſtice to euery man, wee ſhall ſee a many of them helpe themſelues with this holy vertue, to entrap the wealth of thoſe that either through follie or neede haue entangled themſelues in the moſt ſubtile nets of pleading, neither can any man expreſſe the extortion that vnder ſuch colour is committed. Moreouer, there runneth a great rumour of ſome gouernors of Townes and Caſtles, and paraduenture of whole Prouinces, who to the ende to mainteyne their pompe and fill their coffers, doe vſe newe lawes to the detriment both of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Commons:</hi> as if the purpoſe of offices tended either to make an outward ſhewe, or to glut them with wealth, and not rather to make their vertues to ſhine in ſuch functions both to the reliefe of many &amp; to their maiſters honor.

And yet we muſt thinke that when oppreſſion is growne vniuerſall and continual, then <hi>God</hi> haſteneth his iudgements to deſtroye vs, becauſe wee will not amend when we are inſtructed and taught, and that doth the Prophet well ſhewe when he ſaith. <hi>The Lord ſhall enter into iudgement with the auncients of his people, and with their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>

               <p>The third vice afore mentioned, is diſſolution, vnder which tearme I doe comprehend <hi>Adulterie, Pompe, Pride, Glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi>

And although in our age, nature is much enclyned to ryot and vanitie, yet may wee ſay that the euill example giuen in moſt eminent places, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with impunitie, haue bene great helpes to encreaſe this miſchiefe, which taketh the ſurer roote when it is practized and borne out by the mightie. Now, among the vices aboue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Adulterie</hi> hath the preeminence. And beſides that it corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note place="margin">The kindes thereof.

In all places they are ſo addicted thereto, that they care no more for concealing of it, as in tyme paſt when honeſtie held them in ſome ſhame. In theſe daies they ſeeke onely to couer the filthineſſe thereof with beautifull titles or pleaſant aunſwers, yea they goe further in ſome, euen notable places. For they accompt this vice as a neceſſarie ſpurre, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with when one is pricked and can guyde himſelfe cunningly, or atteyne to any worthie price that he hath deſired, he is exalted: he is enuied: he is ſayd to haue a good capacitie and quicke vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. After this ſorte doe they make blacke white, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pureneſſe to that which is filthie and foule. Youth which is eaſely catched with theſe baytes, holpen by cuſtome, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned by lawes, doth more and more ſtirre vp their appetites hereto, and hauing once taken ſo bad a trayne, the ſtate of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and age doe nouriſh rather then aboliſh it. This vice doth naturally reſemble the Cancre which by little and little gnaweth

For the outward ſhewe of things are in ſuch eſtimation, that many tymes men iudge of the perſon by his apparell; ſo as it ſeemeth wee would ſay, that the chiefeſt perfections are hidden vnder the coſtlieſt gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Kings &amp; Princes did not ſo ſoone chaunge their auncient ordinarie ſimplicitie into <hi>Italian</hi> gliſtering brauerie, but their ſubiects immediatly imitated them, yea and ſome endeuoured to exceede them: and this miſchiefe hath ſtooped ſo lowe that pompe and pride appeareth euen in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane citizens of ſimple townes. Herewith hath the Nobilitie eſpecially empouriſhed her ſelfe ſo ſore, that ſhe can no longer ſo mainteyne her ſelfe to doe the King any ſuch ſeruice as in tyme paſt. Neither doe women for their parts forbeare theſe ſuperfluities: for weening with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ornaments to breede themſelues more beautie, commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and honour, they haue not ſince bene ſo carefull to adorne themſelues with the beautifull giftes of vertue which doe farre exceede the others.</p>
               <p>At the tayle of all theſe vanities commeth <hi>Pride,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <note place="margin">Pride.</note> it be borne with man, doth neuertheleſſe whet it ſelfe and encreaſe with their ſmoake: or rather according to the opinion of others, engendreth them. But howſoeuer it is, the one ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with the other: ſo that of this vnreaſonable preſumption or ouerweening of themſelues groweth the contempt of others, and thence come iniuries, quarels and manifold murders.</p>
               <p>An other braunch of <hi>Diſſolution</hi> is table exceſſe and great <note place="margin">Table exceſſe and great fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture.</note> furniture, wherein many doe ſuffer themſelues to bée willingly led away, as taking this path which is ſo full of intemperance to be the only meanes to liue in pleaſure and fame. All which bad cuſtomes do perticulerly corrupt and ſpoyle whole families, and being mixed with publick errors doe make the diſeaſe of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall bodie more incurable. Doe we then thinke that <hi>God</hi> will

long ſuffer theſe corruptions which are to him ſo odious? It is not like: but rather are we to feare leaſt the iudgement comming ſo ſlowly will bée the more grieuous. How many kingdomes, where they haue atteyned the fulneſſe of al vice, haue bene ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne and giuen in pray to ſtraungers?

Theſe are in parte the cauſes by them noted, which breede ſundrie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in eſtates and bring them to naught. All which things <note place="margin">The applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe principles to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtate of France</note> may eaſely be ſeene to concurre in ours, and thereby may wee iudge of the ſickneſſe thereof. But albeit wee are not altogether to contemne the Philoſophers opinions, yet muſt wee rather cleaue to thoſe of the Scriptures, which ſearch out the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cauſes in mans tranſgreſſions: For <hi>GOD</hi> deteſting the ſame doth withdrawe his fauour and protection from whole Realmes, and then ſpring vp confuſions.

In ſuch affayres as this, wee muſt not flatter neither our ſelues, nor other men, but freely declare what paſſed experience doth ſhewe. Among many deſolations happening to an eſtate readie to fall, the two worſt are theſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt, when one mightie nation, or many, being of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers diſpoſitions and language doe come to vſurpe, and bring into bondage: then is it not to bee demaunded how many miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the ſubdued muſt endure.

doe ſeaze each vpon his owne portion, which they gouerne in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers maner, and for the maintenaunce of themſelues doe leane to ſtraungers: then likewiſe enſueth a great ouerthrowe of all things, and the calamities doe long endure.</p>
               <p>Of theſe two only will I now diſcourſe, as being thoſe which <note place="margin">A diſcourſe vpon the firſt cauſe or origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of an eſtate.</note> threaten vs and are the worſt, neither is it to any purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye that <hi>France</hi> cannot incurre theſe inconueniences: For ſith ſo many and ſo deteſtable miſchiefes, together with ſo many and ſo diuers partialities haue ſet in foote, we muſt imagine them (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeedie remedie) to bee the open ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Theſſaly</hi> ſhaking off the yoke of <hi>Michael Angel</hi> yeelded to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Paleologues. Achaia, Attica, Peloponeſſus, Aetolia, Caramania and Epirus</hi> had their ſeuerall gouernors, whom they often chaunged according to the ſundrie euents of warres and ſedition. Eſpecially <hi>Attica, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia and Peloponeſſus</hi> were gouerned ſometymes by the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> ſometymes by the <hi>Sicilians</hi> and <hi>Florentines,</hi> ſometyme by the <hi>Genowayes &amp; Venitians,</hi> euen as the hazard of warre fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: notwithſtanding moſt of them made there no long aboad. The <hi>Bulgarians, Ruſcians and Seruians</hi> had their <hi>Deſpottoes,</hi> who being ſometymes friends and confederates with the Emperors of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and by and by againe enemies, did with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall

roades waſt <hi>Thracia and Macedonia.</hi> Theſe confuſions did deſerue the name of théeueries rather then of warres, becauſe both the ground of them was vniuſt, and the practiſes wherewith they holpe themſelues moſt wicked. For they ſought all meanes to rent and teare the Empire in péeces, whereby the Emperour of the <hi>Turkes</hi> had oportunitie to ſeaze vppon <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and the other Prouinces. The ſame author in an other place ſaith thus. <hi>I will likewiſe rehearſe the calamities that oppreſſed almost all Italie, as a puniſhment for the ſinnes that therein rayned: which happened during the mortall deuiſions betweene the Emperours and the Popes, when the names of Guelph and Gibeline were the markes of each fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For ſo many miſchiefes were there then committed, ſo much blood ſhed, ſo manytownes destroyed, and whole Countries layd waſt, that whoſoeuer ſhall reade the histories thereof cannot but meruaile. Then did there ſpring vp many pettie Tyrants in moſt townes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging no ſuperiour, but leaning ſome to the Popes and ſome to the Emperours, exerciſing all cruelties againſt both friends and foes, vntill that Italie, rather wearied then ſatiſfied with ſo many miſeries, did after a long tyme take an other courſe.</hi> I will alſo repeate one domeſticall example, namely the deuiſion betwéene the houſes of <note place="margin">Another hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie which more neerely toucheth France, ſet downe at large in the French Anales.</note> 
                  <hi>Burgundie and Orleance,</hi> which was ſo ſharpe as it induced the <hi>Engliſh</hi> warres, which brought <hi>France</hi> to ſo lowe an ebbe that it was almoſt vtterly deſtroyed, yea it had diſmembred the ſtate into ſundrie morcels, if <hi>Gods</hi> great goodneſſe had not holpen. In the meane tyme for the ſpace of fortie or fiftie yéeres it was made a pray: euery one ſeeking either to kéepe himſelfe, or to encreaſe his owne power, either els to deſtroye his enemie. All publique force, mightineſſe or iuſtice whereto men might haue recourſe, being vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly extinguiſhed. To be briefe, it was a Countrie habandoned to euery one that could catch any part thereof, all which miſeries doe warne vs that wee may yet happen to trye them once more. For ſtraungers may ſee ſo good ſport that they may fall vppon vs againe.</p>
               <p>But it is farre more likely that our eſtate ſhould incurre the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The extreme miſerie of France, if once it come to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it ſelf.</note> diſmembring whereof I haue ſpoken. And the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>French,</hi> being by nature fierce, and hating forraine bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, will rather become ſubiect to it ſelfe, and ſo of this one great bodie make many péeces. For the aſſurance whereof, the vſurpers would put themſelues into the protection of ſuch of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as could moſt commodiouſly mainteyne them, and withall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8683:18"/>
were moſt conformable to the opinions that they ſhall haue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced. When I doe more néerely conſider this, I finde no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſo miſerable, diſordered, and confuſed as ours: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch would burie all iuſtice, lawfull authoritie, reſpect, feare, good maners and concorde, and to the contrary encreaſe all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepertneſſe, ambition, trecherie, violence, Impietie, guile and ſedition: And who could delight to liue among ſuch ſtormes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it were ſome barbarous minded perſon? Among all theſe alterations I imagine ſome Prince to ſeaze vppon ſome one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince: ſome Lord vppon ſome Townes: ſome head Cities to conuert their <hi>Parliaments</hi> into <hi>Ariſtocratyes</hi> of ſome of their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and principall Citizens: and others to growe into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwelths. Among the Nobilitie alſo other ſorts of Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>Oligarchiall</hi> or <hi>Monarchiall.</hi> One would become a prince ouer his owne Caſtles, an other a Tyrant ouer other mens. One quarter of the Countrie would growe into <hi>Cantons,</hi> an other commit it ſelfe to ſome warlike Capteyne, as for thoſe that ſhould at ſuch a tyme finde themſelues ſeazed of the ſtrong holdes of the greater Townes, thinke whether they would haue any parte herein: All which diuerſities of gouernments, humours and qualities of men muſt néedes bring in mortall warre and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which would not bee ended while wee and our children were conſumed.</p>
               <p>Of theſe my ſpéeches ſome man might imagine that I preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <note place="margin">Whether the Realme could ſubſiſt though ſuch partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhould diſmember it.</note> that the royaltie ſhould then bee as it were made voyde: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſo long as that remaineth in authoritie the aforeſayd confuſions can no way come néere vs. Truely my ſelfe would be as loath as any man that the ſame ſhould bee ſo much as contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: For ſith wee haue liued 1100. yéeres vnder that gouernment, it were our partes to reuerence it, as a lawfull power ordeyned by <hi>God,</hi> whereto whoſoeuer doth not voluntarily yéeld obedience, the ſame is guiltie before him. Beſides that wee are to thinke no other gouernment more meete to guyde the <hi>French</hi> then that. But becauſe the matter whereof I entreate doe leade me from bad cauſes to thoſe worſe effects y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> enſue, it hath alſo cauſed me to ſet downe ſuch things as might happen, to the ende that imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in vs ſome feare, wee ſhould endeuour ſo to behaue our ſelues as they might not come to paſſe. But if wee ſtill perſeuer any tyme in our imperfections and diſorders, let vs not doubt but <hi>God</hi> will take away his good Angell from <hi>France,</hi> whereby wee ſhall
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8683:19"/>
ſee the royall dignitie diſobeyed, and in ſmall fauour with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and the ſame likewiſe exempt of all loue and humanitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, which will bee the accompliſhment of the deſolations aforeſayd. For the eſchuing of which inconueniences, we ought moſt zealouſly to pray to <hi>God</hi> long to continue our King, and in him to encreaſe all true Pietie, Juſtice, wiſedome, and affabilitie, graunting vs likewiſe to bee as affectionate toward him as were the <hi>Romaines</hi> to the good Emperours <hi>Traian</hi> and <hi>Titus:</hi> for if the Realm ſhould fall vnto children, eſpecially now that the lawes are out of force, Magiſtrates contemned, maners corrupt, hatred and ambition exceſſiue, it muſt needes be in great daunger.</p>
               <p>Now let vs proceede to the remedies, and ſee whether there <note place="margin">The laſt part of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which entreateth of the remedies.</note> be any ſo ſufficient as to warrant vs from deſtruction. In my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion there be ſome, if we can finde the way to take hold of them in tyme. For in this tempeſt wherein wee are toſſed wee muſt not ſhrinke vp our ſhoulders and ſay, <hi>All is loſt,</hi> but wee are valiantly to helpe one another. But to what remedies ſhall wee haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe? To <hi>Philoſophers</hi> rules? Or to paſſed experience of ſuch meanes as haue ſerued to vnderproppe this Realme when it hath bene ſhaken? Either els to the politique counſailes of the wiſe that now liuing doe knowe our griefes? For that were the way that wiſedome would teach. Hereto I aunſwer that wee may reape <note place="margin">The firſt and principall poynt.</note> profite out of all, but it is neceſſarie that wee beginne further of. In as much as wee ſee that for our tranſgreſſions <hi>God</hi> hath withdrawne his fauour from vs, it is requiſite that wee appeaſe him to the ende he may returne vs it againe, otherwiſe all humaine remedies are in vaine: for what power, wiſedome, or counſaile is there that can alter any thing that he hath decréed againſt vs? In the holy Scriptures wee haue a notable example of his mercie toward the <hi>Niniuites</hi> that were heathen people: for when his <note place="margin">Example.</note> wrath was kindled againſt them, and he had by the Prophet <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> to the ende to terrefie them, pronounced the ſentence of their <note place="margin">Ionas. 3.</note> deſtruction, they were ſo touched to the quicke that their King and all the people hauing faſted, wept and prayed, and turned from their wicked way; he withdrewe his plagues, which alreadie hung ouer their heads, &amp; tooke them to mercie. How often did the <hi>Iewes</hi> féele his woonderfull compaſſions, when for their wickedneſſe and <note place="margin">Another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> tranſgreſſions his ſcourges euen light vpon them? Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they and their Kings through true repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance turned vnto him, he tooke pitie of them &amp; conuerted their pitifull eſtate into proſperitie. Wherof it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8683:19"/>
followeth, that our ſoueraigne and onely meanes to auoyde theſe calamities that doe now aſſaile and threaten vs, is to imitate thoſe whom I haue named. For as it is one great comfort, when a man knoweth that his griefe is not altogether incurable, and that there be meanes to heale him, much more doth it increaſe when he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the ſame to bee eaſie. The ſame is in vs, and conſiſteth in knowledge, will, and execution, whereof euery one through holy perſwaſions and example of the greateſt, may bee made capable: For when men ſhall ſee firſt the King, and then the Princes and ſuch as are in authoritie either Ciuill or Eccleſiaſticall, in earneſt and without hypocriſie to make ſhewe as well generally as perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly that to <hi>God</hi> onely wée ought to haue recourſe, and withall effectually to declare a hatred of vice &amp; loue of vertue, embracing the politique vnion and eſchuing diſcord, vndoubtedly the inferiors will ſtudie to doe the like.

And the like may the Proteſtants ſay concerning their Prayers, Meditations, Abſtinences, and ſinging of Pſalmes and Himnes, wherewith they alſo endeuour to appeaſe him.

When you ſhall lift vp your hands I will turne my eyes from you: and when you ſhall multiplie your prayers, I will not heare you, for your hands are full of blood. Waſh you and bee cleane, take away the corruption of your thoughts out of my ſight. Ceaſe from doing euill and learne to doe good, ſeeke iudgement, helpe him that is oppreſſed, doe right to the fatherleſse, and defend the cauſe of the widow. Then come vnto me ſaith the Lord. Though your ſinnes be as red as ſcarlet yet will I make them as white as ſnowe.</hi> Hereby it appeareth that wee muſt come ſincerely vnto <hi>God</hi> and amend our liues in deede, if we will obteyne his bleſſings; for to ſeeke to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him with diſſembling ſhewes, is the way to diſpleaſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke him.</p>
               <p>It may be there are ſome that will ſay, that to propound rules <note place="margin">The ſecond conſideration of the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie afore mentioned, with an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to thoſe that call it a Paradoxe.</note> of deuinitie for the reeſtabliſhing of Commonwelths, is no more
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8683:20"/>
but to ſet downe Paradoxes: but thoſe men in my opinion are farre deceiued. For as Iuſtice, Wiſedome, Fortitude, and Temperance are the ſtrong pillers that vphold the ſtate, ſo muſt wee thinke that Piety is the foote and foundation of them all: for if they be not fixed in this moſt woorthie vertue, they cannot but ſhake, becauſe it is neceſſarie to begin the worke with ſuch a foundation. Greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then they, haue I to ſay that it is no Paradoxe, but rather a woonder that now in <hi>France</hi> there be ſo many that contemne thoſe things which ſtirre vp to integritie of life and reuerence to <hi>God.</hi> At the leaſt I am aſſured that there are many good men as well of the one ſide as of the other, which euen long after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reeſtabliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of good order and the preſeruation of the eſtate, and will not reiect my opinion. Leauing therefore vnto thoſe that haue farre more learning, cunning, and experience then my ſelfe, the propounding of more excellent matter that may ſerue to ſo good an ende, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to this worke onely ſo much as I may, according to my ſmall capacitie; and through my conceiued feare leaſt wee ſhould fall into ſuch daungers as threaten vs, I ſeeke in tyme to lay them open: becauſe it is much eaſier to preuent ſuch miſchiefes as haue bene foreſeene, then thoſe that happen vnlooked for.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus diſcourſed vpon the firſt and moſt healthſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, <note place="margin">Diſcourſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> I will proceede to ſpeake of the reſt which alſo are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and whereof the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> haue made mention. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> who had as good iudgement in pollicies as any other whoſoeuer, doth generally ſay that if we can finde by what meanes eſtates are corrupted and decayed, wee ſhall alſo knowe the meanes whereby they may be clenſed and preſerued. Conſidering that of contrary cauſes doe proceede contrary effects, alſo that corruption is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to conſeruation. Hereby may the ſimpleſt eaſilie knowe how to put this rule in practiſe. As for example: If the ſale of Iudiciall <note place="margin">Reformation of ſundrie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as it were by the way.</note> offices doth breede the ſale and peruerting of Iuſtice, then ought we to forbeare ſelling of them, and ſo to giue them freely to good men. If pompe, ſuperfluous expences, and vnreaſonable giftes haue for their maintenaunce inforced Princes to lay intollerable and vnſupportable tributes vppon their ſubiects, then muſt they moderate their affections, to the ende oppreſſions may ceaſe. If impunitie of vice doth multiplie and encreaſe it, then muſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection deminiſh it. Euen ſo is it in many other cauſes. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to the ende the better to lay open this matter, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth yet other meanes. As, that nothing be done contrary to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8683:20"/>
lawe and cuſtome, eſpecially that miſchiefes, how ſmall ſoeuer, bee preuented in the beginning. That thoſe that bee put in publique au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thoritie doe behaue themſelues modeſtly, as well toward them that beare no ſway in the Commonwelth, as to them that doe: in doing no iniurie vnto any, but liuing peaceably among the reſt. That thoſe vpon whom the ſafetie of the Commonwelth doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend doe continually watch and ſtand vpon their guard, and many tymes giue cauſe of feare, to the end the Citizens may be the more readie and intentiue to doe whatſoeuer is meete for publique ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. To beware that there happen no contention or debate betwene the mightie, alſo that others which are no partakers be preuented before they meddle. That by the lawes there be order taken that no man waxe too mightie. And that priuate perſons frame their liues to that forme of gouernment whereto they be ſubiect. Many other rules there bee that helpe to this effect, which are to be ſeene in the fifth booke of this Philoſophers <hi>Politiques,</hi> in the workes of <hi>Plutarke,</hi> and in other good authors; for I haue here gathered together only thoſe that firſt come to hand.</p>
               <p>But if wee haue but our owne lawes and olde obſeruations, yet <note place="margin">That the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore France are eaſie.</note> were the ſame ſo ſufficient as we neede not to borowe any other, if we would put them in practize: Which if we doe not, then are all other remedies in vayne. The moſt ſinguler precept therefore that tendeth to the reſtoring of this eſtate, is to be willing to reſtore it. This doe I ſay becauſe that within theſe fiue and twentie yeeres wee haue vſed ſo many practizes hereabout, that now wee thinke thoſe to be but in ieſt that ſpeake any thing in good earneſt. Such procéedings muſt wee chaunge: for neceſſitie hauing taken place (who preſcribeth a law to the greateſt) we muſt now perforce do y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which before of our own accord we would not. No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath herein ſo great intereſt as his maieſtie. For the ſtate of his Realme being well reformed, himſelfe ſhall bee better beloued and obeyed of his ſubiects: more mightie, ritch and quiet. As alſo it is he that may doe more then lawe, force, or any man whoſoeuer. When he hath choſen what he will ſay or doe (which the grace of <hi>God,</hi> his owne ſinguler wiſedome wherewith he is adorned, and the aduiſe of the wiſe, may inſtruct him in) it were a good precept that at the <hi>Court</hi> and in <hi>Paris</hi> (which are the two lightes that ought to ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all <hi>France)</hi> order might be firſt throughly eſtabliſhed, to the end all others might direct themſelues according to theſe two moſt ritch preſidents. So long as the citie of <hi>Rome</hi> kept her ſelf ſound,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8683:21"/>
her inferiours floriſhed in vertue, but when ſhe came to be corrupt, the infection was ſpred all ouer. Yet minde I not hereby to inferre that all diſorders haue their originall from the rulers, for many doo ſpring from the ſubiects: but it is to bee perceiued that ſome of the principall fetch their beginning from the principall perſons, and ſo doe remaine.</p>
               <p>There is yet an other ſoueraigne precept, without the which all <note place="margin">The third re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, which is moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie.</note> the reſt are to ſmall purpoſe: and that is to ſeeke ſome meanes how to take order in the controuerſies of <hi>Religion</hi> without force of armes. For vntil ciuill warre be baniſhed, it is but a folly to ſpeake of redreſſe, becauſe the ſame worketh a greater breach in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, in maners, in lawes and in men in ſixe moneths, then may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bee repayred againe in ſixe yéeres. Among other the fruites thereof this is one, That it hath engendred a million of <hi>Epicures</hi> and <hi>Libertines.</hi> Secondly, it hath made moſt part of the <hi>French</hi> nation ſo wilde, cruell and ſauadge, that where they were before but ſhéepe, they haue now put on the ſhape of Tygers. Theſe two reaſons might fully ſuffiſe to perſwade euery one that is poſſeſſed of any one ſparke of conſcience or charitie, to deſire and wiſh that we might be brought into concord by fayre and peaceable meanes. For ſo long as diſcord holdeth our ſwords drawne, we doo nothing but eſtabliſh a new Kingdome of Impietie, Iniuſtice, Crueltie and Theft, wherein many théeues and wicked perſons do riſe and grow ritch with the ſpoyle of the innocent, and glut themſelues with blood. A man may truely ſay, that if all the <hi>French</hi> nation were deuided into ſixe parts, wée ſhould finde that fiue of them doe day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie mourne and pray to <hi>God</hi> to graunt peace vnto <hi>France,</hi> and a good politique redreſſe vntill an Eccleſiaſticall may bee had: which diſpoſition being in maner vniuerſall, maketh the difficultie to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to that poynt a great deale the leſſe. The ordinarie obiectiou hereto, is, that two Religions cannot poſſibly conſiſt in one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwelth. And when we aſke wherefore, it is annſwered, becauſe of their repugnancie, which bréedeth perpetuall contention. But I <note place="margin">Aunſwer to the obiection, That it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for two Religions to conſiſt in one common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welth.</note> would knowe of them whether vice and vertue, good and bad bée not alſo contraries, and yet we muſt not for the remedying thereof bring a whole Realme into diſſention.</p>
               <p>In the tyme of the good Emperours <hi>Conſtantine and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius,</hi> alſo when the two holy Biſhops <hi>Auguſtine &amp; Ambroſe</hi> floriſhed in the worlde, were there not in the <hi>Romaine Empire</hi> both <hi>Pagans, Iewes, and Arrians,</hi> whom the true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were

                  </gap>lent perſecutions? Are wee more wiſe or mightie then thoſe Emperours, or more holy and zealous then thoſe holy Biſhops? I thinke wée had néede of a good Orator to perſwade that. So that ſith they haue ſo farre exceeded vs in perfection, wee are not to bée blamed though wée guyde our ſelues by their rule as well in matters of pollicie as of the Church. And notwithſtanding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Children of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> there chaunced ſome ſeditions and troubles for Religion, yet doth it appeare that the <hi>Arrians</hi> were euer the authors thereof: for the true Church hath ſieldome bene ſeene to vſe perſecution. Which this excellent ſentence of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> very well verefieth, that ſayth. <hi>He that perſecuteth is of the deuill, but he that is perſecuted is of God.</hi> It is ſayd that King <hi>Frances</hi> the firſt, when the <hi>Suitzers</hi> were at warre among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for Religion, counſailed them to appeaſe ſuch controuerſies by modeſt conferences and gentle meanes; which ſince they haue happely put in practiſe and ſped well by it: for thereby haue they mainteyned concorde among themſelues, and mightilie enriched their Countrie, and yet are become neuer the worſe. This ſole example might ſtoppe their mouthes that vpholde that fire and ſworde muſt determine our debates, alſo that gentle meanes are vnprofitable. But I cannot thinke that ſuch counſailes can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede from any other then moſt cruell and hypocriticall mindes. To bée briefe, I thinke aſſuredly that if their Maieſties, their <note place="margin">What the chiefe &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſtate may and ought to doe in the reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof.</note> Counſaile, the Princes and the Court of Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> would vnfainedly labour for a generall reconſiliation and redreſſe, notwithſtanding whatſoeuer contrarietie, the ſame might eaſilie be brought to perfection. Are they to be reſtrayned by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the <hi>Popes</hi> precepts, who by his Nuncios ſeeketh vnceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly to trouble <hi>France?</hi> Muſt they feare the rage of ſome of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> that crye out, <hi>Kill, murder, haue no pitie vpon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants our aduerſaries?</hi> Can the power of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Empire, (which they haue prouoked out of ſeaſon) force the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſheath their <hi>French</hi> ſwords in the bowels of <hi>France?</hi> Shall the feare and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnts of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (which are not without ſome grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) ſo terrefie them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhall deſiſt? Or may the ſecret practizes, which tend to ſtirring vp of great matters, feare them? Truely all this ſhould not let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from eſtabliſhing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoueraigne law that bringeth health to al <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of peace &amp; concord.

the King be armed with his grandfathers magnanimitie to daunt all ſuch as dare propound any pernitious Complois againſt the Commonwelth, as alſo to harten thoſe that are deſirous to ſay &amp; do well. The <hi>Queene mother</hi> likewiſe is to remember that ſhe rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any, is able to fixe the nayle in the turning wheele of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, which would be to her life a Crowne of moſt excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations. The Princes likewiſe muſt call to minde that dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall power acchieued by a vertuous peace, is as aſſured and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie as that which is purchaſed with doubtfull and infortunate warre. This great Senate which maketh ſuch account of fame, is to thinke that it ſhall loſe the ſame that it hath obteyned, vnleſſe it bring forth ſuch excellent Senators as with pure hart and franke ſpeech will freely vphold, as did our <hi>Cato, (l'Hoſpitall)</hi> publique equitie. But if to the contrary they ſhewe themſelues obſtinate and ſlacke in readineſſe and labour, they ſhall be the firſt that ſhall feele by the contempt and diſobedience of the inferiours, (whom they haue ſuffered by warres and corruption to tranſforme themſelues into barbarous conditions) how great an ouerſight it is, not to cut off, when they may, the way to ſuch confuſions as tende to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertion of the whole. A King by encreaſing his dominion atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth great honor, but much greater doth he obteyne by vniting and clenſing it when it is deuided and infected: for the firſt is compaſſed by force, the other by diſcretion. Such braue exploytes (as worthie their greatneſſe) are to them reſerued, to the end in the ſame to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploye themſelues. So did <hi>Charles the</hi> 7. to whom the reeſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good order and auncient cuſtomes in his Realme through wiſedome, was no leſſe glorie then was the recouerie thereof from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation, partly by force and partly by fortune.</p>

For ſo doe I imagine that in ſixe yeeres it may be halfe reeſtabliſhed, and in tenne altogether. Great and ſtrong bodies that are well founded, and haue ſome good parts yet ſound, doe riſe vp againe as woonderfully as they were ouerthrowne.

The feeling of our miſeries ought ſufficiencie to mooue vs, as alſo ſhould the bad reputation whereto we are growen among all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> nations, who now doe hate vs as much for the vices that they impute vnto vs, as in tyme paſt they commended vs for our vertues. Now they ſtand no longer vpon the reproouing of the <hi>French</hi> inconſtancie and inſolencie, as in tyme paſt: They paſſe on a great way further, yea ſo farre as all whatſoeuer diſordinate or diſſolute behauiour, whether in maners or in politique gouernment, is attributed thereto. This mightie kingdome which heretofore was the refuge of the oppreſſed, and a ſchoole of all learning and honeſtie, whether our bordering neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſent their youth to bee inſtructed, is now by them tearmed a denne of diſſolution which they feare to come néere. Such as tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile forraine Countries, can (if they liſt to confeſſe it) be good wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the reproches wherewith we are taxed. Yea, which woorſe is, often tymes the common voyce attributeth like imperfections both to the good and bad. I am aſhamed to write what I haue heard, euen of ſuch as are very modeſt, who ſpake rather of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion then reproach.

In the meane tyme let vs not faint, for I ſuppoſe there is no Eſtate in <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> that yet hath better matter then we, but it is now ſo mixed together, as if a man ſhould make a mangle of Diamonds, Rubies, Iron, Lead, Gold, Siluer, Marble, Braſill, Pearle, Corrall, Tyle and Slate.

Truely I cannot but woonder of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the heathen had of many good rules, which carefully put in practiſe doe greatly helpe mans life, wherein alſo they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed their wiſedome: notwithſtanding, me thinkes that to the ende well to knowe wherein the perfection of vertue doth conſiſt,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8683:23"/>
we ought not ſo much to depend vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as to ſeeke it in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>God</hi> from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce all other barbarous &amp; prophane nations haue from time to time collected ſome ſmall parcels, which bréede light to their vnderſtandings &amp; beautie to their works.

               <p>Wee ſhall not, as I thinke, néede many words to declare what <note place="margin">What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord is.</note> 
                  <hi>Concord</hi> is, which reſembleth not other liberall artes or ſciences, whereof fewe men haue knowledge: for it is very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, neither is there any but may make ſome tryall thereof. Wee may in fewe words ſay that it is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable affection which bindeth &amp; ſtrictly ioyneth vs with our like in all neceſſarie &amp; honeſt dueties. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch conſent it were very hard for any ſocieties, either great or ſmall, long to continue, by reaſon of thoſe contrarieties, which as naturally do méete in thoſe perſons wherof the ſame be compoſed, &amp; would procéed to alteration, if by this holy vertue they were not ruled. If we caſt our view vpon vnſenſible creatures, we ſhall ſee that the agréement of the elements among themſelues doth main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne <note place="margin">It is diſperſed all ouer the world.</note> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their being, whereas diſcord ouerthroweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perature of the humors of mans bodie procéedeth health; &amp; of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperature diſeaſes. Yea the foules of the ayre, the beaſtes of the earth &amp; the fiſhes of the ſea without an inſtinct of <hi>Concord</hi> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally imprinted in them, would deſtroye each other. Farre more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is man bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, man I ſay, who participateth in reaſon, to haue the vſe thereof in great recommendation: as knowing the woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull commodities that it bringeth, euen to inferiour creatures.</p>
               <p>Before we come to entreat of publique <hi>concord,</hi> we wil ſpeake <note place="margin">The kindes thereof, and firſt of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall.</note> a little of the domeſticall: which is as it were an apprentiſhip &amp; ſtep toward the other, as alſo it is to be preſumed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he which ſhall haue duely practized it in perticuler matters, will take a delight to vſe it in ſuch as are generall. And this ought greatly to induce houſehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders very carefully to haue an eye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it beare ſway in their houſes, to the ende their children, who are the citizens that they leaue to their commonwelth, may in tyme be accuſtomed to reiect all ſuch <note place="margin">Vpon what conſiderations it is founded.</note> vayne contentions as may diſpoſe their mindes to perturbe it.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8683:24"/>
Howbeit, peraduenture the reſpect of their owne commoditie will further vrge them to the maintenance thereof. For vnleſſe it bee ſome fewe ouerthwart perſons (as we tearme them) all others can ſufficiently feele the fruite that commeth of it. And admit that families bee compoſed of ſundrie perſons, ſome to commaund, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to obeye, yet muſt there bee no reſpect to exempt one more then another from the vſe of this vertue. The maiſter and miſtris <note place="margin">Of Domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call concord.</note> of the houſe muſt haue it written in their hearts, and ſhewe it forth by their gentle and moderate commaundements. The children and ſeruants each in his degrée by frée and voluntarie obedience, are to ſhewe themſelues touched with the ſame affection. It is requiſite for brethren and ſiſters, which be to liue a certeyne ſpace together, to obſerue an honeſt equalitie betwéene themſelues, and yet defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo much as ſhall be requiſite vnto him that hath the priuiledge of elderſhip: for through ſuch mutuall <hi>concord</hi> families doe flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. And what perſon is well borne that reioyceth not in the view of ſuch goodly examples? This mooued <hi>Dauid</hi> to ſay:
<q>
                     <l>Oh how happie a thing it is, and ioyfull for to ſee</l>
                     <l>Brethren together faſt to hold the band of amitie. <note place="margin">Of Ciuill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</note>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This may bee applyed as well to great ſocieties as vnto ſmall domeſticall aſſemblies. For that which is conuenient to the one, is alſo conuenient to the other, in reſpect of the ſimilitude betwéene the whole and the parts. But order requireth that we begin firſt to inſtruct by the ſmaller things: whereby are wee to learne, that ſith honeſt men doe ſo delight to ſee vnion mainteyned either in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie or citie, they will take much more pleaſure in putting it in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: becauſe there is more pleaſure in action then in contemplation only, eſpecially when it is of it ſelfe approued and of others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
               <p>After y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pleaſure followeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> profite: for it ordinarily falleth out <note place="margin">Of the profite and pleaſure that it bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</note> that thoſe houſes wherein <hi>concord</hi> doth beare ſway, doe encreaſe, and that encreaſe is the ſecond thing that houſeholders ſhould reach vnto, as to liue well, is the firſt. No man can denye but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie and diligence are the two moſt neceſſarie inſtruments to atteyne to wealth. And yet may we ſay the ſame to be vnfruitfull in whatſoeuer companie where diſcord taketh hold: euen as in a <note place="margin">Similitude.</note> Galley the labour of the ſlaues were to no purpoſe, if halfe ſhould rowe one way and halfe another: but when all with one minde and at one tyme hale toward one ſelfe porte, the nauigation is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. I will not ſearch any examples in antiquitie to prooue this <note place="margin">Example in generall.</note>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:8683:24"/>
my ſaying, becauſe euen at this inſtant wee ſee enough before our eyes. Namely, many families, as well of Gentrie and Citizens, as of Huſbandmen and Farmers ouerthrowne with diſcord, and many alſo enriched through the good concord of kinſemen. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, to this purpoſe I cannot ouerſhip one notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple mentioned by <hi>Liuie,</hi> which although it bee not practiſeable in <note place="margin">A perticuler example.</note> this our corrupted world, yet is it meete to be conſidered. It is of a certeyne <hi>Romaine</hi> that kept in his owne houſe ſixteene of his children, all maried, and their families, who liued together a long tyme in perfect peace and amitie, and encreaſed their ſubſtance. Which are effects in truth woorthie <hi>Chriſtians</hi> rather then Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims.</p>
               <p>This when I doe conſider, I am aſhamed to ſee that a mans childe cannot in theſe daies bee a weeke maried, but he muſt haue <note place="margin">Defaults in the concord required in vs.</note> his ſtable a parte and forſake his fathers houſe, to goe build (as he imagineth) ſome newe Monarchie in another place. And the cauſe of ſuch ſeparations is, becauſe men either cannot, or will not liue in <hi>concord.</hi> I once heard one ſay that he knewe thrée gentlemen that after their fathers deceaſe kept houſe together, holding their goods in common, which they mightely encreaſed, and neuer parted houſehold till their children were maried, and inſtructed in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent doctrine of vnion through their long practiſe. And this I thought good to ſet downe, not ſo much to induce others to do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as to ſtirre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of difficult things to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploye themſelues in ſuch as are eaſie. I thinke there bee fewe but will commend this goodly kind of life; but peraduenture there may be many that wil contemne ſuch encreaſe of goods as come ſo ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: becauſe in theſe daies we ſee them come in ſo ſuddenly. But ſay they what they will, yet ought wee not to order things according to preſent couetouſneſſe and confuſions. Rather ſhould they bée guided by reaſon, and after the ſimilitude of naturall order which kéepeth meaſure and tyme, for thoſe are the iuſt waies, and for the moſt part ſuch as bee ſo forward, are accompanied with ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, we muſt ſet no more by ritches then by a good name, <note place="margin">The meanes to mainteyne concord.</note> and that doth he get that beareth himſelfe modeſtly and in all faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie among his equals: for therby do men iudge that thoſe mindes that are ſo well diſpoſed in ſmall matters cannot bee badly bent in great. As alſo it is to bee preſumed that he which can well agrée with his father, will not greatly diſagrée with his Kings comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8683:25"/>
alſo that he that can liue peaceably with his brethren wil not lightly fall out with his companions: or that can ſubmit him ſelfe to domeſticall cuſtomes, will obeye publique lawes. Hath it not bene ſeene that out of ſmall families, ſuch perſons haue bene choſen as haue bene thought méete to appeaſe the controuerſies of a whole ſtate, becauſe of the good <hi>concord</hi> of their owne houſes? There bee examples enowe of tyme paſt, and euen now may wée finde ſome ſmall experiences. But in my opinion this is enough concerning the fruites that ariſe of domeſticall <hi>concord.</hi> For there are but fewe but knowe that it bringeth great.</p>
               <p>Now will I enter into a larger field and diſcourſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique <note place="margin">Of publique concord.</note> 
                  <hi>concord,</hi> which is ſo neceſſarie for the helping of our poore <hi>France,</hi> which through the baniſhment therof is almoſt rent in pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that me think all good men ſhould bend their whole vowes and endeuours to the calling of it back againe. And when we ſhall haue ſhewed how other eſtates are thereby encreaſed and redreſſed, men will be farre the more affectionate to put it in execution. <hi>Plato</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ſayth, that the greateſt miſchiefe that can befall any citie is ſedition, which is no other but diſcord. Whereof it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth <note place="margin">A ſentence.</note> that <hi>concord,</hi> being the contrary muſt needes be a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite to them that enioye it. Likewiſe it is vnpoſſible to thriue by their commodities, before this foundation be layed: yea we ſee that the greater plentie of power, wealth, and habilitie that is in a ſtate, if this good temperature be away, is but matter of greater ruyne. Some wiſe men in old tyme knowing this, did vſe to ſend to ſuch of their friends as had the gouernment of commonwelths a ſheafe <note place="margin">A notable Embleme.</note> of Arrowes bound together, to the ende to admoniſh them that as theſe ſo ſmall péeces of brittle ware being knit together made a ſtrong bodie not eaſely ſhaken, ſo if the mindes of their people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented well together &amp; were vnited in themſelues, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which of it ſelf were but weake, would become mightie &amp; ſtrong. The experience here of hath bene ſeene in the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who ſo long as they agréed among themſelues, did withſtand the power of the Kings of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> which was inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable, for ſometymes they brought in nauies of 1000. ſayle, an other tyme by land 600000. men, who all were ouercome by ſmall armies of ſuch men as loued like brethren, and which acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bondage of their fellow countrime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as their own, ſo good concurrence was there betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; ſo long as this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued they mainteyned themſelues in credite &amp; felicitie. <hi>Plutarke</hi> reporteth, that before the tyme of <hi>Aratus,</hi> all the townes of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaians</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Another example.</note>

were of ſmall acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, each trafiking &amp; doing their affaires apart, and taking no care but for themſelues: but after he had ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Plut. in the life of Aratus.</note> them together, and vnited ſundrie other ſmall Townes vnto them by perfect <hi>concord,</hi> they grew into a great and mightie body in <hi>Peloponeſſus,</hi> and oftentimes did reſiſt ſuch tyrants as ſought to vſurpe their libertie, wherby they became terrible to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>But if anie man imagine that examples taken of Monarchies <note place="margin">A thirde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> would better fit our eſtate, to the end to content him, I will alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge ſome ſuch. The firſt of the kingdome of the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> wherein <hi>Licurgus</hi> eſtabliſhed moſt excellent diſcipline, which among all other things commended <hi>proweſſe</hi> &amp; <hi>concord:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of alſo a long time they continued ſo good obſeruers, that their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſéemed to be but one ſole family, ſo ſteadfaſt and good was their vnion. By that did they increaſe and purchaſe ſuch fame, that all <hi>Greece</hi> did oftentimes ſubmit it ſelfe to their conduct and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Many other might likewiſe be herevnto added, as wel <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> as other Nations, whereof ſuch as vſe the reading of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories cannot be to ſéeke, and therefore it were but a ſuperfluous repetition here to heape them vp againe. Onelie it ſhall ſuffice to remember that ſuch Monarchiall eſtates haue from time to time increaſed as much by <hi>concord</hi> as by anie other vertue that euer they put in practiſe. And although the <hi>Romanes</hi> in the daies of their firſt kings did ſometimes diſagrée with their next neighbors, yet doe we ſée that afterward they grew into moſt firme accord, as with the <hi>Sabins,</hi> for of the two Nations they became but one peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but farre better ordered and a greate deale more mightie than they were before.</p>
               <p>From this antiquitie let vs deſcend euen to our daies, and vnto <note place="margin">A fourth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> that which is euident in our owne eies, to the end thereby to be the better perſuaded, &amp; conſider the ſtate of the <hi>Suitzers,</hi> for that may be vnto vs a cléere ſpectacle wherein we ſhall perceiue the praiſe of <hi>concord</hi> and fruites thereof. The hiſtories do teſtifie that the thrée little cantons, <hi>Schuitz, Vri &amp; Vnderualde,</hi> whoſe habitations are onely in villages, were the firſt authors of that their vnion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into the reſt are ſince incorporated. Which euer ſince hath ſo well continued, that at this daie their bodie ſéemeth as it were inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I muſt alſo commend the <hi>concord</hi> of <hi>Germanie,</hi> which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their controuerſies in religion and ſtrife for digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, hath neuer altered, and in déede it now flouriſheth as much as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8683:26"/>
euer it did.</p>
               <p>What excuſe then maye wee alleadge, wee <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> as a ſufficient diſcharge for that we haue ſo long fought one with another, conſidering how other nations can vpholde themſelues in <hi>conford</hi> and amitie? Trulie it is time we ſhould take inſtructions for remedie of our calamities by the felicitie of others, to the end to make vs ſeeke meanes to returne into that which now hath forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vs. The waie is alreadie found, if wee woulde put it in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. That is to grow into <hi>concord</hi> among our ſelues, for ſo ſhall we riſe againe and increaſe.</p>
               <p>I knowe ſome will ſaie that it is but a diſcourſe, to affirme that <note place="margin">Obiection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer counſel &amp; aduice. Anſwere.</note> France grew great by <hi>concord,</hi> for their increaſe procéeded of the <hi>Frenchmens</hi> valiancie. Whereto I aunſwere, that I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie but that force together with iuſtice and good order were cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the increaſe, yet muſt they néedes confeſſe that if theſe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie pillers had not had for their baſe and foundation, mutuall <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> betwéene the king, the nobilitie, and the commons, it muſt néedes haue yéelded vnder the waight of ſo great a burthen. Our firſt aunceſtors did ſufficientlie ſhew forth the profite that therein <note place="margin">Confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> they reaped, in that they knew howe to vſe that vertue: For they were many diuerſe nations, inhabiting the bankes of leſſer <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie:</hi> who not hauing felt the <hi>Romanes</hi> bondage, neither wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in anie caſe to trie it, did aſſemble and gather themſelues together, and named themſelues <hi>Francons.</hi> Then they planted themſelues along the <hi>Rhine,</hi> from whence they ſtepped into <hi>Gaul</hi> which they ſubdued. Thus hath a certaine learned man written in a treatiſe of the originall of the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> which opinion I thinke to bee more likely than that which the other writers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
               <p>Heereby it appeareth that <hi>concorde</hi> hath beene one of the chiefe cauſes that of many Nations we were made but one: and if wee will farther marke the increaſing thereof, wee ſhall finde that ſame occaſion hath likewiſe ſtoode them in greate ſteade. This doe I ſpeake in generall, becauſe the perticular effectes which haue from time to time enſued, woulde bée ouer paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to rehearſe, and maye likewiſe bee troubleſome. Onelie I will by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the waie report the bleſſed <hi>concord</hi> that was among <note place="margin">Another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> the <hi>French</hi> nation in the time of king <hi>Lewes the twelfth, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the great, and Henrie the welbeloued,</hi> which continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8683:26"/>
ſixty yeres, not ſo much to refreſh the remembrance of diuerſe yet liuing, who haue ſéene the moſt part of that time, as for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſuch as haue beene onely beholders of the laſt diſorders, to the ende to labour them the more earneſtly to long after a good vnion of heartes, as yet ſo ſtrangelie alienated. It is moſt euident that all theſe thrée Princes did greatly loue their people, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Lewes:</hi> and thoſe charges that hee layed vppon them procéeded through the vrgent neceſſitie of warres, notwithſtanding ſome haue bene but raſhly enterpriſed.</p>
               <p>The lyke or rather more was theyr loue ſhewed to theyr no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, as well in reſpect of the acceſſe and familiaritie that they allowed them about their perſons, as alſo of the worthie rewardes beſtowed vppon them. Likewiſe we neuer ſawe vertue in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtimation, than at that time. But what obedience, honour, and affection, did as well the nobilitie as communaltie than beare to their kings? More coulde not haue bene wiſhed: for they were neuer wearie of ſounding forth their prayſes, beholding of theyr perſonnes, and hazarding themſelues to all daungers for them.</p>
               <p>Then if we woulde but conſider the accord that was among the ſayde ſubiectes, what ſhoulde wee doe but wonder how they could ſince ſo farre diſagrée? To be briefe, that all partes of this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Realme dyd together yéelde ſo pleaſant a harmonie, as euerie man was gladde to dwell therein, yea, euen ſtraungers flocked to participate in that felicitie. And notwithſtanding in the time of King <hi>H. the ſecond</hi> many things beganne to alter, yet did vertue beare ſuch ſwaie, that the outward forme at the leaſt ſeemed fayre.</p>
               <p>After this manner dyd the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> liue vntill the yeare 1560. when <hi>Concord</hi> beganne to flie from among them, after whoſe departure vertue and iuſtice haue not ſo much ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues abroade, nay they are gone to ſoiourne heare and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their priuate friends, where they aſſure themſelues of better entertainment. This, in my opinion, may ſuffice to proue that through <hi>concord</hi> ſmall things doo increaſe, and great are maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and kept.</p>
               <p>Now let vs compare that time with this which wee now ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">Beginning of the diſcords of France.</note> haue triall of, and we ſhall ſee the difference to be no leſſe than betwéene a faire bright Sunne ſhine day in the ſpring time, wherin
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8683:27"/>
nothing appeareth but flowers &amp; greene graſſe: and a foule Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters daie in the which the clouds &amp; tempeſts darkning the aire, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be ſéene but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graſſe depriued of her orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, ſéeming to be white with froſts and ſnow. But like as by the order which God hath eſtabliſhed in nature, after foule weather commeth faire, ſo are we to hope for a more fortunate world after this, when once we haue through a holie conuerſion appeared his wrath.</p>
               <p>If a man enter into ſpeech hereof by and by a number come in <note place="margin">The originall thereof.</note> and ſaie. Oh, what is it that hath troubled and diuided vs, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities of opinions in <hi>Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</hi> Likewiſe there are others which on the other ſide doe replie that it is not the nature of <hi>Religion</hi> to bring forth ſuch and ſo many calamities: but rather that the cauſe is to be impeuted to the mallice of man, who loueth darknes more than light, and to their ignorance that think that ſuch contrarieties ſhould be decided by fire and ſword, when in deede they ought to be determined by gentleneſſe and clemencie.</p>
               <p>I would thinke that experience ſhould make vs wiſe in this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie, <note place="margin">Frutes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde.</note> which ſhall nothing let me from proſecuting my purpoſe &amp; declaring what diſcord doth ingender. Neither will I goe to ſéeke exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples hereof in foren lands, neither in times paſt, but in our own Countrie and age: for if anie man be deſirous to behold the image of all miſchiefe, hee néede not ſeeke farther than into <hi>France,</hi> where this tragedie haue bene plaied, the actors whereof beeing <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> who euer ſince they were ſezed of this curſed paſſion, doe neuer ſticke to hurt each other. And like as a continuall feauer weakneth and pulleth downe the ſtrongeſt bodie: euen ſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of our warres hath almoſt abated &amp; depriued the Realme of the principall of her greatneſſe, mightineſſe, and beautie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in appeareth the truth of the other parte of the ſentence alreadie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, viz. that <hi>by deſcord great thinges doe periſh and runne into decaie.</hi> Now notwithſtanding hatred ordinarilie ingendereth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, <note place="margin">Diuers effects according to the diuerſity of the French mens paſſions toſſed with diſcorde.</note> where amitie for the moſt part bridgeth forth <hi>concord,</hi> yet hath not this bene the cauſe that hath driuen many of thoſe that are entered hereinto: but rather ſome haue bene vrged by zeale, others by perſecution, and othes by ſome duty that they ow to other men. As alſo we haue ſéene many diuerſe effects, ſome more gentle than other ſome, whereby the authors of the ſame deſerue commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that they haue in theſe vnmercifull calamities borne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more moderatlie. I dare not rehearſe the horrible cruelties committed in all places (notwithſtanding ſome haue felte them
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8683:27"/>
more than others) for the remembrance of them cannot but either bréede great horrour or exaſperation. Yea, ſome ſuch haue beene wrought as may be tearmed to bee againſt nature: as when ſome haue deliuered their néereſt kinſmen to the ſlaughter, or dipped their handes in the bloud of their owne friends. I thinke if anie man had in the dayes of king <hi>Frances the firſt</hi> foretolde thoſe thinges that haue ſince happened, he had ben ſlame as a ſpreader of lies, and yet haue our beaſtly mindes bene ſuch, that we haue euen extolled and magnified the prodigious actions which blind rage hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I beſeech God we neuer fall againe into the like abhominable gulfe of inhumanitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thucidides</hi> a wiſe hyſtoriographer dooth briefely deſcribe the <note place="margin">The image of France in the ſtate of olde Greece. Thucid. li. 8.</note> manner howe the <hi>Grecians</hi> behaued themſelues in their ciuill warres. Whoſe ſaying I haue thought good here to inſert, to the end we may compare the forepaſſed miſchiefes with thoſe of our time, thereby to diſcerne in which of theſe times mallice preuayled moſt. <hi>After it was knowen</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that anie riot was committed in one place, others waxed bolde to doo worſe, to the end to worke ſome noueltie, to ſhew themſelues either more diligent than others, or elſe more inſolent and hot in reuenge: and all the miſchiefes that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted did they diſguiſe with gaie titles, as tearming raſhneſſe, magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie: modeſtie, cowardlineſſe: headlong indignation, manhood and boldneſſe: counſaile &amp; wiſe deliberation, cloked daſtardlyneſſe: Thus he that ſhewed himſelfe moſt furious, was accounted a loyall friend, and he that reproued him ranne into ſuſpition. If anie one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie faction propounded any thing that were good and honeſt, it was not liked of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if they were able indeede to impugne it, they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be reuenged, than not to be wronged. If by ſolemne oth they made any attonement, the ſame laſted vntil the one ſee himſelfe the ſtronger, whereby he might violate, infringe, and ouercome it through mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</hi> Yea, he reporteth much more, which to auoide tediouſneſſe I omit.</p>
               <p>Now therefore would I know whether we haue not bene equal with the <hi>Grecians</hi> in like actions? I thinke that none dare denie it: but that we haue ſurmounted them in crueltie it is moſt euident. Such <hi>Frenchmen</hi> as after ſo many ruines ſhall remayne, maye iuſtly make that exclamation that <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> made for <hi>Greece. O poore France how vnhappie art thou, that haſt with thy own hands ſlayne ſo many of thy good men, as might haue ſufficed in a daie of

battayle, to roote out all thy proudeſt enimies, which ſeeke thy ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe:</hi> Truely wee muſt confeſſe that diſcorde hath brought not one ſickneſſe but many, and thoſe moſt greate and daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
               <p>And becauſe there be ſome, who as it ſémeth, would willingly cloke and conceale ſome, and haue vs to counterfait health, I <note place="margin">How many calamities diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord hath brought into France.</note> haue thought good to ſet before their eyes that which a writer of our time, intreating of our miſeries, hath ſet downe: for any thing that tendeth to good inſtructions ought to be read and read againe in many places. Marke therfore his words: <hi>Publike diſcorde hath ingendered among vs irreuerence to God, diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to Magiſtrates, corruption of manners, alteration of lawes, contempt of iuſtice, and the decaie of learning and knowledge. It hath bred horrible vengeance, ignorance of conſanguinitie and kindred, obliuion of amitie, violence, ſpoyle, waſting of Countries, ſacking of townes, burning of houſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcations, theft, baniſhment, proſcription, cruel deſtruction, chaunge of gouernment, with infinite other exceſſes and intollerable miſeries, pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull to the eie, and wofull to the eare.</hi> I thinke that he ſayth but the truth, &amp; as all good friendes ought to doe, to the end we ſhould not account our wounds, which are moſt daungerous, and as it were mortal, to be of ſo light cure &amp; ſo leaue the ſoueraigne medicines, and vſe ſuch as be but ſlight and friuolous. Neither do I heare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <note place="margin">Why theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chiefes are here ſet downe.</note> all theſe iniuries, to the end to awaken the wrath of thoſe that haue ſuſtayned them, for I haue a farre other meaning, which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth rather to roote out the remembraunce of them all: but I doe it onely to the end that ſeeing our ſhame, we might bee aſhamed. Which is as much as if a man ſhould ſhew to the father his child ſprauling on the ground al bloudy with the ſtripes that in his rage hee had giuen him, &amp; ſo ſaie to him. <hi>Now that you are pacified looke vpon the goodly peece of work that you did in your choller: for now you may ſee that you haue endomaged your ſelfe.</hi> Were not this enough to make him aſhamed, and withall, to with-hold his hands another time.</p>
               <p>Now the better to laie open the miſchiefes ariſing of diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I might alleadge the examples of that that hath fallen out in <hi>Italy,</hi> in the time of the factions of the <hi>Guelphs and Gibelines:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What ſhould teach France the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warres.</note> in <hi>England</hi> in the warres betwéene the two houſes of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> and in <hi>Germanie</hi> when the <hi>Popes</hi> maintayned theyr
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8683:28"/>
factions againſt the <hi>Emperours:</hi> But all this is not able to teach vs ſo much as the leaſt warre of ſixe that wee haue had experience of alreadie: becauſe that the thinges that a man ſéeth, feeleth, and is imployed in, doe make a farre deeper impreſſion in the mind than the ſimple bare rehearſall of things paſe. And this ſhal make me to contayne my ſelfe in the bounds of our owne Countrie: &amp; that the rather becauſe we muſt of neceſſitie aſcende euen vnto the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times to finde lyke monſters as are two of thoſe that haue bene formed in our diuiſions. Whoſe names if any man deſireth to <note place="margin">Monſters bred in ciuill warres</note> knowe, the one is called <hi>Murther,</hi> the other <hi>Couetouſneſſe.</hi> The firſt can neuer be ſatiſfied with bloud, neither the other with riches. So as notwithſtanding the peace that hath bene often concluded, hath ſomewhat brideled them, yet haue they ſtill entrapped ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſecretly. I thinke that during the horrible proſcriptions of <hi>Silla,</hi> and ſlaughters of <hi>Marius,</hi> the like were bredde at <hi>Rome</hi> and deuoured the <hi>Romaines,</hi> where ours were no ſooner co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued, but they were borne in <hi>France,</hi> and ſince haue ſpoyled the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> Thus is <hi>Rome</hi> the fatall ſhop wherein are forged the ſwordes of ſlaughter that haue alreadie ſhed ſo much bloud, where alſo are hammered the counſels of deſtruction which haue ben moſt miſerable vnto thoſe that haue followed them.</p>
               <p>The remembrance of all this filthineſſe and diſorders ought to <note place="margin">A neceſſarie &amp; profitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</note> bréede a great compunction in our hearts, and pricke vs forward to embrace vertue which heretofore hath beene ſo familiar with vs, neither is it to be doubted but that if wee woulde ſet our affections therevpon, we ſhould ſhortly ſée it in as great honour all about, as euer it was: for notwithſtanding the <hi>Frenchman</hi> doth go aſtraie, yet at length he returneth to his waie, and the true meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn is by calling agayn our guide, whoſe name is <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cord</hi> ſhe wil ſet vs in our right path where we ſhall finde <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receiue vs gladly: but withall let vs take héede of leauing her leaſt we goe aſtraie againe: for if we follow her ſhe will leade vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſoone into the goodly and large fields of plentie and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, where honour and contentation, who doe there make theyr aboade, ſhall receiue and feſt vs worthilie.</p>
               <p>This wil ſome man ſay is ſoone ſaid, but not ſo ſoone done. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I anſwere y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the effect is difficult, but to them onely that do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8683:29"/>
in ſuch vnruly appetites as feede onely vpon diſcords, contentions and hatred: howbeit wee muſt remember that all theſe vehement rages and practiſes of reuenge (the true nurſes of diſcorde) are <note place="margin">Whether it be a hard matter to bring peace againe into France.</note> no other but (as the Philoſophers tearme them) defectes of the mindewhich ſuffering it ſelfe to bee lead by the ſenſes, is moued at euerie chaunce that happeneth: whereas it ought conſtantly to beare whatſoeuer in honeſtie it maye or ſhoulde, to the ende that by preſeruation of order and tranquilitie, the naturall courſe of mans life may with more facilitie be performed.</p>
               <p>I haue many times noted, that after we had put vp our ſwords into our ſheaths and began to be conuerſant againe one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially with our parents and friendes of the contrarie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, we did together bewayle the miſerable time paſt, wherein the one might haue chaunced to haue ſlaine the other, whoſe lyfe he had holden as deere as his owne, and wiſhed that in all our dayes wee might neuer haue the lyke calamities agayn. Then haunting with ſuch as we had leſſe acquaintance of, we light vpon mildneſſe and a miſlyke of paſſed furies. A third manner of men did we ſometimes méete withall, which were the moſt violente of euerye faction, and yet did we finde in them farre more moderation than wee coulde i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine. Then ſayd I to my ſelfe: <hi>Muſt it not needes be that there is ſome furie hidden in the bowells of France that thus intangleth vs? ſith ſo many preparations to vnitie and concord cannot any whit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite vs, or bring vs to the inioying of this felicitie?</hi> Yet was I not quite out of hope, but that at length wee might attayne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>All this made and yet maketh me to imagine that want of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">The meanes how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce concorde and expell diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion.</note> each other when occaſion requireth, maketh vs to grow ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage one to another: for in abſence we ſet before our eyes onely the iniuryes paſſed, whereto commeth reporte, ſuſpition and ſlaunder, ſo that though one were as white as ſnow, yet by ſuch blemiſhes he may be made as red as ſcarlet. We ought likewiſe to conſider that notwithſtanding our warres haue continued aboue 24. yeeres, yet doe we ſtill returne to our Fathers houſes, and neceſſitie compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs to be conuerſant again, not with our friends onely, but alſo with thoſe that haue bene our ſharpeſt enemies. Wherefore it is requiſite that wee reſolue our ſelues to mildneſſe, and ſith wee are to liue and die, not among the <hi>Italians</hi> or <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but euen in the ſame lande wherein we are ingendered, let vs endeauour to do

it peaceably, rather than by languiſhing in tumults to bee repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with terror.</p>
               <p>Some man may obiect that ſith miſtruſt is one of the principall <note place="margin">Whether wee muſt bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Truly my counſayle is not altogether to burie it, but rather to leaue it to euerie mannes libertie to vſe it conueniently as occaſion may require: howbeit I woulde haue the occaſions to bée ſuch as may beare ſome apparaunt likelyhoode of truth, and not to reſt vppon euerie trifling imagination, vntill that time haue purged the hearts from rancour, &amp; blotted inueterate hatred out of remembrance. For we muſt thinke: ſirſt that in the end men wil be wéerie of euill willing and of euill doing, becauſe thoſe things are of themſelues tedious and noyſome.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that ſome wil conuerwhen any ſmal ſpiritual motion touch them, &amp; make them know that it is a moſt harde matter for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to loue <hi>God</hi> whom they ſée not, ſo long as they abhorre thoſe that beare his image, and whome they ſée. For this cauſe muſt we not deſpaire of anie, vnleſſe in them appeareth ſome euident to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of mallice, and rooted crueltie conioyned with obſtinacie. Of whom wee may ſaie, <hi>The Phiſition hath giuen them ouer, their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie is vnfruitfull, yea, euen dangerous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before wee ende this diſcourſe, wee muſt alſo ſpeeke ſomewhat of counterfaite <hi>concorde,</hi> and peraduenture it will not hurt to ſet <note place="margin">Of falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</note> downe ſome warnings vppon that point, to the ende men bee not abuſed, as they that for want of waying and well looking to, doe take counterfaite coine for good gold, for in this ſo corrupt a world wherein wee liue, we muſt looke verie neere vppon thoſe thinges that beare a fayre ſhew: becauſe that vnder ſuch a cloake miſchiefe for the moſt parte lurketh. When therefore wee chaunce to ſee a good agreement betwéene ſome, with whome wee are requeſted to enter ſocietie, let vs diligently enquire whether the ende where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto eyther of them doth tend bee good or badde. For if it be bad, then may wee conclude that agreement to bee falſe, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of ſmall continuance and to be eſchued. This may better be made manifeſt by examples.</p>
               <p>The firſt therefore that I will beginne withall ſhall bee of land <note place="margin">Examples.</note> theeues and robbers, and of ſea rouers.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8683:30"/>
But if we come to conſiderwhat theſe people be, who for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieng of their peruerſe deſires, do confederate themſelues together, and trouble publike tranquilitie with their murther and ſpoyles, in reſpect whereof they are feared and hated as mortal plagues, what ſhall we iudge of their vnion, but that it is a perillous conſpiracie? Lewde and licentions women, that dwell euen by perniſſion in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie Cities, eſpecially in <hi>Italy</hi> &amp; <hi>Spaine,</hi> are ſo familiarly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, that it ſéemeth their league to bee of perpetuall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. But ſo farre is it from being accounted <hi>concord,</hi> that in déed it is rather diſcord, cimented together with poiſon: &amp; I beléeue that almoſt all men condemne ſuch confederacie, and would be loth the pleaſant name of <hi>concord</hi> ſhould be blemiſhed in ſuch ſocieties. Notwithſtanding ſtill there be ſome that let themſelues be caught in ſuch ſnares. Thus much concerning thoſe perſons that haue embraced infamous kinds of life, who both by diuiue and humane <note place="margin">Offurious concord.</note> conſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are to be reproued. There is another kind of <hi>concord</hi> which is furious, as appeared among the peaſants in <hi>Germanie,</hi> who in the yere 1525. armed themſelues to ſacke the gentrie and ſpoile the rich. They liued one with another as brethren, yea, they died couragiouſly together, notwithſtanding their procéedings and purpoſes were abhominable. In this rank I thought good to place alſo the confederacie of the mad <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> of <hi>Munſter,</hi> who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to the number of nine or ten thouſand perſons. Heare wil I likewiſe adde the ſeditious aſſotiations of whole communalties or part of the ſame, for they to the end to cut their throates that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doe together, as did y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

For if you ſhould chance to be ouercome, you might well inough giue ouer the wallet, becauſe no man would giue you ought. But the beſt both for you and them, is to liue at the leaſt in politike concord, and to content your ſelues with the miſchiefes that you haue done each to other, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that mans life is of it ſelfe miſerable inough, though thereto you adde no new miſeries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let vs ſpeake of thoſe that haue attained ſuch a degrée of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe in their lawful vocations, that we may ſay of them, that vnder <note place="margin">Of tyranous concord.</note> the authoritie of lawes and gouernment, they peruert all equitie &amp; iuſtice. Of ſuch aſſemblies we finde many kindes, wherof to auoid ſuperfluous rehearſall, I will note onely ſome of the chiefeſt. The firſt is a framed tyrannie, wherein the publike actions doe tende to ſtrengthning of it with all mens harmes. In this we muſt imagine two ſorts of men, namely, the tyrannizers &amp; the tyrannized. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the laſt, inaſmuch as force euer maiſtreth them, they muſt hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mbly ſtoop, waiting vntil it pleaſe <hi>God</hi> to raiſe vp lawfull meanes of remedie. But for the firſt who liue in ſo ioyful and pompeous v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion together, I doe not thinke it either méete or honeſt to ioyne with them, or to participate with them in ſacking, murthering, and robbing the innocent: much better it were to eſchue ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. But who be thoſe that haue ſo liued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The hyſtories do tell vs and furniſh vs of examples enow both old and new.

This opinion hauing once got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten holde in the minde, is hard to be rooted out againe, and is the cauſe of breach, as well of brotherly loue as of publike concorde. We muſt therefore take heede that in our ſelues wee conclude not ſo haſtilie vpon the condemnation of thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we will not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to take leiſure to know throughly.

And in caſe they were as diligent in reading the Scriptures, as they are to cleaue to the readineſſe of their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they would be of another minde. For there ſhould they find that the word neighbor ſtretcheth indifferentlie to all men, becauſe mankinde is conioyned together with a ſacred bonde of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to the end that by that bond men ſhuld be ſtirred vp to loue each other. It is enough therefore for any one to be our neighbour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a man. For it lieth not in vs to blot out common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And who is he how barbarous ſo euer, that beareth not the <note place="margin">Who is our neighbour.</note> image of God printed in his ſoule, although it may be that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt blotted out? And for this cauſe ought wee among ſo many blemiſhes, and in ſo noble a creature, ſtill to conſider the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent marke that <hi>God</hi> hath imprinted, to the end we hold not that to

Yet are there ſome ſo bitter as to affirme that <note place="margin">Aunſwer to ſome mens obiections.</note> they haue reaſon ſo to doe: and if you aſke them why, they will aunſwer, that he that is vowed to Satan is woorthie all rigour and vnwoorthie any fauour.

               <p>Hereby doe we ſee that the errors of the minde doe enforce the <note place="margin">Correction of the former er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</note> hatred of the hart.

               <p>I doubt not but ſome will bee ſorie that we ſhould endeuour to <note place="margin">Aunſwer to thoſe that will not be reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the rulé of chriſtian charitie.</note> reduce them to ſuch méekeneſſe, therein peraduenture reſembling a certeyne <hi>Abbot</hi> whoſe only felicitie conſiſted in moleſting all the world with law matters, whom a <hi>French</hi> king vtterly forbad that exerciſe: but he aunſwered that now he had not paſt fortie matters, all which he would ceaſe ſith his maieſtie ſo ſtraightly commanded him, neuertheleſſe he beſought him to leaue him one halfe doſen for his paſtime and recreation.

Such as abound in this paſſiion may find ſcope enough to walke in, yea vntill they bee wearie.

But if any, hauing mallice to ſell, would ſeeke any more familier or ordinarie ſubiect to employe himſelfe vpon, I would ſay vnto him. <hi>Friend, open the cloſets of thy ſoule and of thy hart, peraduenture if thou ſeekest well, thou mayſt finde matter enough whereon to exerciſe thy ſelfe, as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Like as thoſe that be well taught, hating mens imperfections <note place="margin">How wee ought to loue our neighbors.</note> can neuertheleſſe loue them, euen ſo is it meete that wee ſhould in like for behaue ourſelues toward our like, and not vtterly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe our loue from their perſons, although wee condemne their errors and wickedneſſe: for many tymes they doe through grace chaunge, and from their vnpure waies come to thoſe that bee pure. This charitie whereof I ſpeake is nothing repugnant to ciuill Iuſtice, neither doth it aboliſh the indignation that wee are to beare vnto the contemners of <hi>God:</hi> for if it were contrary to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and publique order, then were it not humaine but inhumaine. Alſo the proportion betwéene the ſame and deuine charitie is good, for the one ſayth: <hi>Thou ſhalt loue God with all thy hart,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi>

               <p>Concerning conuerſation, whereof ſome make ſuch ſcrupuloſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <note place="margin">Of connerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with our neighbours.</note> alleadging for their excuſe. <hi>This man is an hereticke,</hi> or <hi>that man is an Idolater:</hi> me thinkes they doe ouer raſhly denye it to thoſe that haue an immortall ſoule as themſelues, and doe weare the eſpeciall badge of <hi>Gods</hi> people: which is <hi>Baptiſme.</hi> If they thinke others defiled and themſelues cleane, is it not a part of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie to viſite them to make them alſo cleane? They will aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that they feare leaſt ſpiritual vncleanneſſe ſhould infect them. But examining the matter a little néerer, wee ſhall finde that that is not the matter, but rather that it is a certeyne vyolent hatred that kéepeth them from caſting any good looke vpon thoſe whom they accompt prophane, which they ſeeke to ſhroude vnder the cloake of conſcience. I thinke that diuers doe herein faile through ignorance, as being perſuaded by ſome falſe teachers ſo to doe: but there bee others that make themſelues very ſcrupulous vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a méere péeuiſhneſſe, to the ende to ſeeme the more holie,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8683:35"/>
and yet in marking them well wee ſhall knowe them to be as they are, as <hi>Plutarke</hi> ſaith. <hi>Lyons at home and Foxes abroade:</hi> that is to ſay, In outward ſhewe Hipocrites and inwardly repleniſhed with pride and vengeance.</p>
               <p>We cannot hold any better rule in this caſe, then to imitate our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> who made no difficultie to haunt with all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <note place="margin">A rule to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe in this caſe.</note> according to the rule of his vocation, notwithſtanding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies found fault with him for it when they ſayd to his deſciples. <hi>Wherefore doth your maister eate with Publicanes and ſinners?</hi> But <hi>Ieſus</hi> hearing them, ſayd: <hi>The whole neede not the Phiſition, but thoſe that be ſicke.</hi> By which his example he teacheth vs to take compaſſion of thoſe whom wee finde in the poſſeſſion of ſinne and error, whom we may in ſome meaſure helpe by inſtruction, if they receiue it. Some there are that ſay that he was neuer conuerſant with Heretickes. But I would faine aſke theſe newe Doctors what the <hi>Phariſies</hi> and <hi>Sadduces</hi> were? For he taught the one ſort and did many tymes diſpute of the ſcriptures with the other. Wee ſhall finde that the firſt did woorſhip ſtraunge <hi>Gods,</hi> and the ſecond denyed the immortalitie of the ſoule. Moreouer, what were the <hi>Apoſtles pilgrimages</hi> but continuall communications with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to the end to reclaime them from their errors? Then muſt not wee be ſo cruell, ſith thoſe whoſe followers we boaſt our ſelues to be, vſed ſo great méekeneſſe toward all.

Secondly, that he be well kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, and by lawfull and eccleſiaſticall procéedings manifeſtly and ſufficiently conuict ſo to be. Thirdly, that we ſee him ſo obſtinate, that notwithſtanding whatſoeuer exhortations either priuate or publique, he will not amend, but endeuoureth to infringe the vnitie of the Church in making others to goe aſtray. Then is it méete to put in practiſe his precept: for of the frequenting w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch a man can there come no fruite, but rather moſt euident daunger.

Sith therfore we ſee the world ſo bent, that not only in townes and villages, but euen in families and ſmall houſeholds, the dwellers doo differ in their opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the maner of the true ſeruice of <hi>God,</hi> let vs not woonder, neither be offended thereat: for euer ſince the birth of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>

               <p>In ſuch occurrences the beſt courſe that we can holde to auoyde <note place="margin">Rules to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe.</note> the ſhipwrack of our ſoules, is to ſeeke the way that leadeth to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, which is not to be found but in the truth, &amp; the truth in the holy Scriptures.

In the correction of things hurtfull we are ſometymes forced to ſhewe rigour, which is not to be blamed, if the cauſes ſo require, and that withall wee put away all deſire of reuenge. But to guide the inſtruments of rigour with enuious paſſions, is the way to marre and ouerthrowe all. And this haue we throughly experimented in our poore countrie, who is ſo oppreſſed with thoſe calamities, which through the rage of her owne children ſhe hath ſuffered, that now ſhe doth clutter but with one wing.

But we muſt marke well who they bee, and not impute the fault of a fewe vnto all. What muſt we then doe? For ſooth we muſt not repoſe any credite in them: but in the gouernment of the ſtate, vſe ſuch Princes, Lords &amp; notable perſons as alwaies haue bene accuſtomed to counſell our Kings. Neuertheleſſe, if peraduenture there chaunce to bee ſome among them who in reſpect of their ſinguler vertue and fidelitie might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to perticipate in the chiefeſt honors (whereto the hiſtories do teſtifie that in tymes paſt diuers ſtraungers haue atchieued) who would debarre them?

               </p>
               <p>I would wiſh we had halfe a doſen ſuch ſtraungers euen in our priuie councell. They haue, will ſome man ſay, (I ſpeake of thoſe that traficke) al the greateſt Farmes of the Realme. I do not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile thereat, ſith they are giuen them. If a <hi>Frenchman</hi> could find
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:8683:37"/>
any ſuch commodities in <hi>Italie,</hi> he would poſt thether apace. The beſt remedie for that, is to preferre our owne nation before them. This is not yet all, for theſe men can in fiue or ſixe yeres make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues ritch. Truely if they atteyne to their wealth with either our publique or priuat detriment, they are to be condemned: but if their labour, diligence and induſtrie doth aduance them thereto, you may not blame them, but rather thinke your ſelues very doults that can not do the like. And yet if we will looke well to ſome of our <hi>French men,</hi> we ſhall finde that they haue made as good a harueſt as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt. To be briefe, ſith the moſt part of them are incorporate among vs, as hauing both houſes, wiues and children, were it not great cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie indiſcretly to rent away ſuch a member. <hi>France</hi> hath alwaies bene very courteous to ſtraungers, and ſo in my opinion ſhe ought ſtill to bee, namely to thoſe that we ſee doe cloth themſelues with the naturall affections of the homeborne, and that bring forth good example &amp; better fruite. But the reſt, who as bloodſuckers doe ſucke vs vp and then goe their waies, or that bring in pernitious nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they are to be accuſed, &amp; being conuict, to be made taſte of the ſeueritie of the lawes of <hi>France.</hi> For the puniſhing of a few would correct many.

               </p>
               <p>But it is not the ſtraunger only whom they would haue to be ſo hardly entreated, for when their paſſions prick them, they ſet them <note place="margin">Aunſwer to an other obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe that ſtomacke the Lawyer, the Nobilitie and the Clergie.</note> ſelues againſt the naturall <hi>Frenchmen.</hi> Some ſay that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeate of Iuſtice wherevpon a certeyne forme of <hi>Iuſticers</hi> doe ſit, are now but traps &amp; ſnares, wherein with the bayt of lawes and cuſtomes, both ritch &amp; poore are caught &amp; ſpoyled, &amp; therfore that we muſt ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh one part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; rob the reſt, ſo to ſaue and reuenge our ſelues of their rapine, &amp; reſtore iudgements into their auncient ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Others raging againſt <hi>Friers</hi> &amp; <hi>Muncks</hi> do charge them that they are the examples of all diſſolute life, idleneſſe &amp; hipocriſie, who when they haue liued of other mens labours, doe alſo betray their conſciences, and therfore ſay that wee ought to ſet fire in the fower corners of their couents.

In this caſe would I wiſh his Maieſtie to eſtabliſh ſuch a lawe <note place="margin">Againſt thoſe that counſaile ciuill warres.</note> as was vſed at <hi>Locres</hi> that had relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to another.

               <p>Now let vs ſee what we are to iudge of the other two opinions which do ſeeme more receiueable.

Secondly, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare <hi>France</hi> to a body which by long ſickneſſe is growne into ſo weake &amp; feeble an eſtate that it cannot ſcarce ſtand: &amp; do ſay that the rules of arte do forbid the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring of ſo ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g medicines to him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is ſo weake leaſt they throw him quite downe.

So that if wee but ſpeake of reforming of this or that, by and by they imagine that wee are about to begin to deſtroye them: ſo ſore haue the paſſed iniuries encreaſed diſtruſt. This is the reaſon why the moſt moderate rules, waies and decrees are moſt fit and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie <note place="margin">How we muſt vſe this aduice.</note> to begin withall, to the end to giue to vnderſtand to thoſe that yet are but wilde, that wee purpoſe for the reeſtabliſhment of thoſe things that are in confuſion to proceed with temperance, for ſo by yéelding ſomewhat to their imaginations and feare, we ſhall make them afterward more readie to obey whatſoeuer ſhall be ordeyned, neither neede wee feare to finde any great repugnancie when men ſhall perceiue that the reformers doe meane well. For now many things are chaunged ouer as they were in tymes paſt whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome of the members only had bene diſpleaſed. Now doth the whole bodie complaine, and the patient who before would not knowe his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, cryeth out after the Phiſition.</p>
               <p>It is vnpoſſible, will ſome ſay, to ſee ſo great conſent in ſeeking <note place="margin">Aunſwer to thoſe that thinke it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the ſtate.</note> reformation: for ſuch as gaine by diſorders would haue them ſtill to continue. Hereto I aunſwer, that wee knowe well enough there will be contrariers. But on the other ſide, when men ſhall ſee the greateſt number well diſpoſed, being gouerned by authoritie and lawe, the reſt will ſoone be brought into order. The principall ſigne hereof is example and authoritie royall, couragiouſly commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: without which nothing will be performed. And now will I <note place="margin">Diſorders that neede refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> ſet downe ſome of the diſorders of our eſtate, therby to ſée whether the ſame bee as eaſie to remedie, as many doe imagine they bee: ſo from the leſſer and moſt eaſie I will procéede to the greater and hardeſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt place will I attribute to ſuperfluity in aparrell that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth <note place="margin">1. Superfluiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What meanes is there then to prouide for it? Euen to laugh at all thoſe lamentations, complaints and rages. For from a foole if you take his bable, he will ſtorme, and yet is it requiſite to do it leaſt he hurt others. But, which is yet worſe: theſe exceſſes that we ſpeake of doe hurt thoſe eſpecially that commit them, though at the firſt they be as pleaſant, as in the ende they be pinched, when their liuing is morgadged out. He that would perticulerly touch all theſe kindes of folly, (as the inuenters of <hi>auriculer confeſsion</hi> haue deuided mortall and veniall ſinnes into an infinite number of rootes and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8683:39"/>
braunches) ſhould neede a whole volume. It hath in all ages bene a hard matter to cut off the things that men haue eſteemed to bee their principall delights, yea ſome hiſtories doe reporte that euen the <hi>Romaines</hi> were much troubled therewith. Yet is there great difference betwéene vs and them. For they excéeded when they had aboundance of all things, but wee doe it now that we haue almoſt nothing: Neither doe I feare that we ſhall enter into ſedition for this poynt. They that keepe the Cuſtome houſe at <hi>Lions</hi> will ſay, that vnleſſe euery man may haue libertie of apparell the King ſhall loſe aboue three hundred thouſand crownes of yeerely rent. But if we turne ouer the leafe, wee ſhall finde that there is yeerely tranſported out of the Realme aboue fower millions of Francks, which is caried into <hi>Italie</hi> for ſuch warres, and doe cauſe the King and his ſubiects to ſpende aboue twelue millions in ſuperfluous apparell that might well bee ſpared. In the tyme of <hi>Phillip</hi> the Conqueror vnder whom <hi>France</hi> floriſhed and was aloft, Veluet was out of vſe with them, neither had they any ſtore of Silkes, at the leaſt fewe men did weare them. Neuertheleſſe, the great men were neuer better obeyed, each one in his degrée, then in thoſe daies. So long as nothing but ritch garments doe procure reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and loue, there is but ſmall ſted faſtneſſe therein, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there muſt be ſtronger bonds to bring vs to our dueties. Yet doe I not meane that we ſhould order our garments after the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of olde tyme: for now doe many things abound that were then very rare. The third parte of the Nobilitie at the leaſt could wiſh there were ſome good order taken herein, ſo ſhould they bee better furniſhed with money and leſſe endebted. And I beleeue they could be content rather to ſpend that which they doe conſume in ſuch ſuperfluities, in the Kings ſeruice in the field, where their expenſes ſhould be better employed, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to empoueriſh themſelues in theſe follies: and in liew of ſo many gay hoſen and cloakes bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with gold and ſiluer, to buy good horſes, armour &amp; furniture, therewith to bee worthely furniſhed in theſe honorable neceſſities. So ſhould wee finde aboue 1200, gentlemen able without pay to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie him, which are yet good relickes of our decayed <hi>France,</hi> and might worke as great miracles as euer did <hi>S.

Who the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would make any ſtirre for theſe things: Peraduenture the women, who are wonderfully affected to theſe

goodly ornaments, and would bee very forie they ſhould be cut off. Indeede they ſhould bee allowed much more then men, as well to content their curioſitie, as alſo becauſe they loue to haue ſomewhat that may giue a gloſſe to their beautie.

               <p>There be many other ſuperfluities which I will not ſpeake of, <note place="margin">Other ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceſſiue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences.</note> as hauing touched them els where.

Which if any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire me to name, I muſt report theſe; exceſſiue expences waſted in ſumptuous Feaſtes vppon ſmall occaſion: Maſkes, Playes, ſuperfluous retenues, ſtately builoings, precious moueables: with many other pomps and pleaſures which all do ſtand in great néede of reformation, becauſe that many doe paſſe their dueties and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities: neither ſhould a man lye, that ſhould ſay, that they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to ſpend 1000, crownes in ſuch vanities, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to giue half a one to a poore ſoule that dyeth for hunger; or tenne to a friend that ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in great neede. The cauſe whereof is ouermuch ſelfe loue and want of charitie toward others.</p>
               <p>Now will I ſpeake of matters which ſeeme neceſſarie to be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, <note place="margin">Of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall remedies for this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> if we minde to reforme the eſtate, notwithſtanding it be daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſtirring of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Yet if there were but a fewe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetors in this number, (who now ſhould deale faithfully in their offices, if they could remember what ſhipwracke they had once almoſt fallen into) was ſhould bee ſure enough from any warre there about. But to cloſe with thoſe that weare Swordes: that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:8683:40"/>
can both commaund and ſtrike: and that haue authoritie, friendes, and intelligences, vndoubtedly it would breede great alterations. Was it not one of the cauſes that moued <hi>Caeſar</hi> to take armes, becauſe they would haue viſited him and his partakers, about the wealth that he had gathered in <hi>Gaule?</hi> When the <hi>Gracchies</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and purpoſed to put in execution the law <hi>Agraria</hi> which cut off the poſſeſſions of the ritch, what bloodie ſedition did enſue? For although a thing be lawfull yet is it not expedient to put it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in vſe, becauſe that neither the indiſpoſition of the affayres can beare it, neither the tyme require it.</p>
               <p>Some will ſay that it is a gentle way, to redemand that thing by lawe that hath bene vſurped againſt lawe. True. But if we doe well marke the conſequences, wee ſhall finde them ſo daungerous, that it were a great ouerſight for the gathering vp of a fewe ſmall profites, to encurre great loſſes. For ſith they that will not loſe the goodes that they haue gotten, will not for the kéeping of them ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteyne from vyolence, the ſureſt way were now to wincke at ſome incurable miſchiefes and to looke vpon thoſe that be curable. The lawe of obliuion which wee haue alwaies placed firſt in our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes, which alſo the <hi>Romaines</hi> and <hi>Athenians</hi> after their ciuill warres did put in practiſe, doth warne vs in theſe chaungeable tymes to forget many things.</p>
               <p>The like conſideration is there to bee had of the <hi>Clergie:</hi> for as many did affirme that it were good to take away halfe their goods <note place="margin">2. Of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.</note> (which moſt of them doe abuſe) to diſcharge the Kings debts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the people in reſpect of their pouertie are not able to doe it: theſe great words, as tending to deminiſh their temporall poſſeſſions, did ſo terrefie them, that calling together their wittes, they haue with wonderfull ſleights oftentymes ouerthrowne theſe motions, wherein men began to take ſome ſmall taſte, ſhewing that they could neuer be any whit enclined to relieue his maieſtie, vnleſſe he firſt ſet free the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from the oppreſſions of the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> &amp; after the rooting out of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they would worke merueiles. To be briefe, by ſuch meanes and deuiſes they haue ſo runningly giuen vs the turne, (as we vſe to ſay) that they are beſt in reſt whiles the others are by warre purſued. And ſometymes when they haue bene diſpoſed to take the bit in the mouth, what haue they done? It was ſeene in the States holden at <hi>Blois</hi> in the yéere 1577. For they there ſo played their parts that they ſet one part of <hi>France</hi> againſt the other, while themſelues indged of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8683:40"/>
the blowes: Yea ſome went ſo farre as to to ſay that the <hi>Clergie</hi> poſſeſſed aboue fifteene millions of <hi>Francks</hi> in yerely rent, ſo that if any ſought to oppreſſe them, they would make thoſe that had bitten them to let goe well enough. Theſe examples doe ſhew that it is not for vs to vſe force againſt thoſe that are able by force to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. But I preſume that in as much as they are <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> they will neuer ſee their King fall in neceſſitie, but will ſuccour him, in caſe they finde that by courteſie they be required. Beſides that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they employe not the Church goodes to that vſe to the which they were bequethed, they ought not to refuſe to helpe him whoſe aunceſtors haue permitted them the poſſeſſion of the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ſame moderate procéeding is in my opinion to bee taken <note place="margin">3. Of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</note> with the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> becauſe all the extremities that haue bene practiſed againſt them to reclaime them (as the ſpeech goeth) haue brought them with force to defende themſelues. For it is not poſſible that ſo bloodie a worke of conuerſion can bee perfected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the firſt intent of thoſe that began to frame it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beſt way is to leaue it.

the taking of perſwaſions out of the hart cannot be compaſſed by any materiall inſtrument: but rather by better perſwaſions of truth. Obſeruing this rule, it were moreouer requiſite, to the ende to ſee ſome apparant reſt in the Church., that his Maieſtie ſhould call a nationall, franke and free counſaile (for the Pope will neuer agree to any generall, which he feareth as thunder) conſiſting of honorable Deuines, charitable and louers of concord, who being holily aſſembled may finde ſome indifferent meanes able to reduce vs to a Chriſtian vniou, which we all ought to wiſh, where before we fled one from an other through deuiſion.

The beſt way therfore were to giue ouer all theſe paſſed euill cuſtomes, and to followe thoſe remedies that I haue propounded, or others more meete to attaine to liue in peace withall: for feare leaſt our maiſters endeuouring to compell others to admit their heauenly opinions happen to loſe their earthly poſſeſſions, as alreadie they haue done in a great parte of <hi>Europe.</hi> As alſo wée doe alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in <hi>France</hi> ſee the ritcheſt members of their Demaines in the handes of the <hi>Catholicke</hi> warriours, who hauing receiued ſuch benefites for the rewardes due vnto their ſeruices, it will ſhortly followe that (if the ciuill warres doe continue) neceſſitie and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toufneſſe will procure many of them to appropriate to themſelues the things whereof before they were but farmers, as heretofore it happened in this Realme in the tyme of <hi>Charles the Simple.</hi>

               <p>Concerning the lawe, which is a very vnproportionate mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <note place="margin">Of the lawe.</note> it would deſerne ſeuere reformation, were it not that wee are partly the cauſe that many of the miniſters thereof doe abuſe it: becauſe that to recouer and recompence themſelues they doe (as ſome ſay) ſell by retayle that which they haue bought by great. But the moſt eſpeciall remedie for this, were by little and little and that without iniurie, to ſuppreſſe halfe this mightie armie with all their ſuperfluous formalities, which bréede ſo many delayes. So would it followe that halfe their ſuites would fléete away with the ſtreame. But what exceſſe is there in the order of receiuers, as well in the multiplicitie of offices as in their fees: which ſay they that knowe it, do amount yerely vnto 1200000. crownes: Is not this waſt of treaſure, conſidering that vnder 100000. would ſuffiſe to mainteyne a reaſonable number that might haue that office. The whole reuenues of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great <hi>Duke of Florence</hi> or <hi>Saxonie</hi> amount to no more: which make mée to wonder at our <hi>France,</hi> ſeeing the leaſt péeces of our ruines doe counteruaile ſome ſmall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
               <p>To atteyne therefore to the correction of all theſe diſorders and <note place="margin">Meanes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> many other that are to bee ſeene in other vocations, it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite his Maieſtie ſhould duely and without partialitie call the generall Eſtates, by whoſe meanes he might take good aduice and neceſſarie reſolutions, ſo ſhoule they reape but a fewe curſes of thoſe whome they ſhall haue a little plucked and he the profite. For whatſoeuer men ſay, or in whatſoeuer ſorte wee take the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> they ſtill loue their King. Here might riſe a doubt that might breede blame to the vſe of moderate meanes, if the ſame were not opened and decided. That is, that many would thinke much that as well vnder the colour of clemencie, as alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced through a falſe feare, leaſt by touching them wée might bring out of taſte ſundrie perſons to the preiudice of the Eſtate, we ſhould leaue ſo many vices vnpuniſhed.

But when the lawe commaundeth that blaſphemers, murderers, adulterers and theeues be puniſhed, wee muſt not haue regarde to ſo many circumſtances: for it is our dueties to obeye it, becauſe it is <hi>God</hi> that ſpeaketh: and in truth, that is the way whereby wee ſhould begin to reforme deformed eſtates.</p>
               <p>Now it remaineth that we diſcourſe of the other opinion which <note place="margin">The thirde ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice conſiſting of the two former.</note> mixeth clemencie with rigour.

For as the vyolent which do empayre the diſeaſe are to be reiected, ſo likewiſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> gentle through want of ſtrength to deminiſh it doe proue vnfruitfull.

If, ſay they, our calamities were like to the calamities of an offender, who hauing receiued the ſentence of his condemnation, doth ſuffer one only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer to leade him where he liſt, it might eaſely be baniſhed: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling rather an vntamed Horſe, who when the rider toucheth him with the ſpurre, endeuoureth with his hinder heeles to ſtrike him, or with his teeth to byte him, muſt by him that mindeth to breake him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame be led luſtely, and ſomewhile ſtroken with the rod, and ſomewhile chidden and threatned with a ſharp voyce: ſo muſt we thinke that moſt of our vices are haughtie and proude, and knowing that you feare them, they doe face you: but if you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye vnto them the ſeueritie of the lawe with ſome puniſhment, they are afearde and doe hide themſelues.

               <p>This aduice vppon better examination doe I finde to bee very <note place="margin">The confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> well founded, and by applying it to ſome matters propounded may better appeare, as the Surgions doe applye their oyntments vnto wounds, to the end by their effects to gather the more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their vertues. But if any ſeeke to accuſe mee of taking delight in taxing of diuers perſons, I will aunſwer that if we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to wipe away the blemiſhes happened in any degree, wee muſt firſt ſhewe them. Neither will I bring for example hereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other then thoſe of the ſame bodie whereof I am a member, namely the Nobilitie and men of warre. Let vs now therefore looke vpon the miſdemeanours of the latter ſorte againſt the people in the tyme of peace when they goe to their muſters or returne home againe, either when they chaunge garriſon: There ſhall we ſee that notwithſtanding themſelues haue their pay, yet for the moſt parte they will pay nothing, yea and muſt be ſet at the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſouſe meſſe, as we tearme it, and at their departure their hoaſt muſt ſhewe them courteſie.

For ſooth euen truſſe vp fiue or ſixe of theſe warriers, ſo to make fiue or ſixe hundred wiſe. To be briefe, ſith by the continuation of eiuill warres, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, mallice, and diſobedience are ſo ſore encreaſed, we muſt not now thinke with proclamations and decrees to ſuppreſſe them, vnleſſe thoſe alſo to whom it doth appertaine doe take the rodde in hand therewith to miniſter waight to their wordes.

Yea and they further alleadge that the beſt natures wanting good bringing vp, doe growe very pernitious, likewiſe that they cannot in age be crowned with honor, if in youth they neuer learned to walke in the path of vertue. To bee briefe, they all are of opinion that as Plants and Trees for want of huſbandrie and proyning do grow wilde, ſo youth if it bee not poliſhed by good cuſtomes doe waxe rude and vitious. This in briefe is one ſmall morſell of the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by them left in generall as well to the Parents as Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates: to exhort and ſtirre them vp diligently to ſee youth brought vp and inſtructed in all honeſt diſcipline. But what neede we ſeeke ſo great proofes and confirmation hereof ſith no man calleth it in doubt? Rather ought wee to declare how wee ſhould proceede in this bringing vp, to cauſe it to fructifie in the beautifull actions of vertue.

Likewiſe in doctrine and nurture I will here note another error that often happeneth and <hi>Plutarke</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth: <hi>There are now,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>ſome Parents, who through want of experience doe commit their children to ſuch maisters as falſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe</hi>

                  <hi>themſelues to bee that which they are not: ſometymes alſo they knowe the inſufficiencie of ſuch maisters and yet will put them in truſt, therein imitating the ſicke man, who refuſing the ſkilfull Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition repoſeth himſelfe vpon ſuch a one as by ignorance killeth him. Others there are alſo who through couetouſneſſe for ſparing a little wages, doe chooſe ſimple maisters, therein ſeeking a good penyworth of ignorance.</hi> Uppon which ſaying, <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> on a tyme ieſted with ſuch a father: For when this father aſked him what hee would take to teach and inſtruct his ſonne: he aunſwered, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crownes: <hi>A hundred Crownes,</hi> quoth the father, <hi>O Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>! that is much, Why! I can buy a good ſlaue for a hundred Crownes. True</hi> ſayd <hi>Ariſtippus, and ſo thou maieſt haue two ſlaues: Thy ſonne and him whome thou haſt bought.</hi> Truely that father is very vnwiſe, that trauaileth continually to gather much goodes, and yet will denye a ſmall parte thereof for the inſtructing of thoſe that muſt one day poſſeſſe them. But what commeth of this ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardlineſſe? After his death they prodigally waſt that, which with ſo greate labour hee hath gathered together: or els become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame couetous for lacke of good teaching how to vſe ritches. But thoſe men are to bée moaned, who hauing many Children and being poore cannot ſatiſfie their deſire to haue them well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, but are forced to put them ſome here and ſome there into other mens handes, where they may bee in daunger of euill example: Albeit thereof they are to haue an eſpeciall care, that they miſtake not: but of that wée will ſpeake more at large in an other place.</p>
               <p>Youth likewiſe doe faile in that which concerneth the vſe and <note place="margin">Of Childrens faultes.</note>

exerciſe of the good things that they haue begunne to learne: for when they ſhould put them in practiſe, to the ende to ſettle a good foundation in them, they growe careleſſe, or ſuffer themſelues to bée led away by the force of vitious affections, which ſtriue to ſuppreſſe in them the rudiments of doctrine and vertue. Then therefore is the tyme that Parents ſhould eſpecially beware of diſcontinuance from that which cannot bée formed in them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out continuance. A man when he hath planted a tree, is very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to proyne and looke to it vntill it hath brought foorth fruite, and then is he ſatiſfied in that he ſeeth it is not barren, neither his labour loſt.</p>
               <p>The like care is to bee had of young Children; for to the ende to bée aſſured that they haue profited, wée muſt firſt ſee moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent teſtimonies, and then is the care the leſſe. Oh how happie are the Children whoſe fathers, euen from the cradle, are ſo fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as neuer to ceaſe their inſtructions vntill the yéeres of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: to the ende their mindes and handes haue no leſſe perfection then their bodies growth, force and health? For ſith the conduct of their life is afterward to bée grounded vppon themſelues, it is very requiſite to procure that the foundation bée good. Thus much in generall briefly what is, after the doctrine of <hi>Plutarke,</hi> to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in the inſtruction of youth.</p>
               <p>Now muſt wee ſee the maner how the French gentrie doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue <note place="margin">Application of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd to the French Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and firſt to careleſſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</note> themſelues in the nurturing thereof, ſo to knowe wherein they doe ill and wherein well. Then to ſhewe what may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for the eſtabliſhing of a better order then any that yet is vſed in ſo neceſſarie a matter. But before wee ſpeake of thoſe that herein doe ſhewe their good affection to their Children, I muſt ſay ſomewhat of the others that doe but little or not at all diſcharge their dueties therein. Truely thoſe bee ſuch people as would bee ſent to ſchoole among beaſtes, to the ende by their example to learne to haue more care of that which themſelues haue engendered: for when they ſhall ſee with how vehement loue the brute beaſtes doe kéepe and nouriſh their young ones, they muſt bée very ſenceleſſe if they bée nothing mooued therewith. Many fathers there are that thinke the greateſt bondes wherein their Children bee eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially bound vnto them, doe conſiſt in that they haue begotten and fedde them. Neither is it to bée denyed but that the ſame bee very great, neuertheleſſe one more there is which muſt not bée for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and is no leſſe to bée confeſſed, namely, inſtruction in pietie
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8683:46"/>
and vertue. For of this benefite is man onely participate, where all other benefites are common alſo to beaſtes. Man is borne to a better ende then to liue, that is, to liue well: and that muſt he bee taught to doe, ſith he hath reaſon to comprehende it. And therein alſo doth fatherly loue manifeſt it ſelfe, and childlike duetie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. But many fathers doe fayle herein through ignoraunce, contenting themſelues with kéeping their Children at home, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing them and giuing them their fill of meate and drinke, as if they were to care for their bodies onely: And the cauſe of this retchleſneſſe proceedeth of their owne ill bringing vp in their youth. Others there are whoſe heartes are poſſeſſed with ſuch extreame auarice, that they are ſo farre from being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſpende ſome one crowne vpon the teaching of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they euen thinke to haue done much for them, if they giue them foode: therein ſhewing themſelues vnworthie of iſſue.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had a law, whereby thoſe Children were diſcharged from relieuing ſuch Parentes in their age, as were careleſſe in ſeeing them inſtructed in their youth: which they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned to the ende to make them more readie to fulfill the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of nature, as being aſſured that he which denyeth his childe inſtruction and correction, leaueth him to bee a pray to vice which afterward draweth him to deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Other fathers there are ſo fondly minded as to weene that there commeth but ſmall profite of putting their Children to Schoole, thinking it enough for them to bee able to write and reade a little. One ſhall bee ſo great a Huntſeman, that all his delight ſhall bee in Houndes and Forreſtes. An other, a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reller with his neighbours, and rough to his ſubiects: One that ſhall allowe of no other kinde of life, but to bee luſtie in his houſe: An other altogether giuen to ſuites and lawe, as thinking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more conuenient for him then to encreaſe his ſtate with ſubtelties and barreting guiles. To bee briefe, euery one louing his profeſſion would that his children ſhould take the ſame courſe, whereby to bee like to himſelfe, as if he were aſhamed that they ſhould paſſe him in the knowledge of vertue. Thus doe the falſe ſhewes of pleaſure, profite, and honor abuſe men, and binde and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayne them to the ſame obiect whereto euill cuſtome hath made them moſt to encline.</p>
               <p>Now let vs ſpeake ſomewhat of thoſe whoſe willes are good to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8683:46"/>
haue their children taught, and thereto doe employe themſelues, and yet cannot alwaies atteyne to their deſired purpoſe. Of thoſe ſome deceiue themſelues, others are abuſed by the degenerating of cuſtomes. Concerning the firſt, they are eaſely ſatiſfied with a <note place="margin">Of the parents that are well affected to the inſtitution of their children.</note> fewe outward beautifull demonſtrations that they happe to ſee in their children, and neuer ſeeke further but thereby to iudge that they haue well profited, which they haue not done, in that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, that ſhould be eſpecially looked vnto, is not well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde imagining that good examples ſhould alwaies ſhine in Princes Courtes, forreine Countries, or warres, do very inconſideratly caſt their young ſeede into thoſe fieldes which they thinke to bee fruitfull. But experience teacheth them that many tymes reporte is a lyer, and many graines are quite loſt. Howbeit, the better to lay open this matter, we are to vnderſtand that thoſe <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen that loue vertue and honour, ſo ſoone as their children bee of age able to trauaile abroade, doe ordinarily ſende them foorth to learne that which at home they cannot. And their maner is either to make them Pages to Princes and Lordes: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to put them among the Princes footmen, either to ſende them into <hi>Italie</hi> or <hi>Germanie,</hi> either els to commit them to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities: all which are fit meanes to inſtruct them in ciuilitie, warfare, learning, or knowledge of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ongues, whereby men climbe to honour, ritches and vertue. And ſith there are no other ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie waies but thoſe, men are conſtrayned to take them; yea and they are to be commended, who led by a good deſire doe ſo trayne vp their Children: But as in all places the corruption of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is greate, ſo without eſpeciall good heede wee finde that thinking to gather Honey, they bring home nothing but Gall.</p>
               <p>Firſt for thoſe that become Pages.

and finally moſt expert in lying and working a thouſand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts. But ſome will ſay that their Maiſters and their Eſquires haue an eye to them, yea but too faintly. And when the ſayd Pages are growne a little craftie ſo as they can couer their mallice, and with all that they haue atteyned ſome ſmall derteritie in any other matter, their hidden vices will not appeare vntill the ſnme haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſure roote. But if any Lords haue a more watchfull eye to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, it is much if there be two of the ſixe: ſo farre are we growne to neglect the true care that wee ought to haue of youth. The onely remedie therefore to bee vſed herein is, firſt that parents ſuffer not themſelues to be ſo bliuded with a vaine opinion of greatneſſe that they couer rather to place their children in the ſeruice of a Prince, where is but ſmall good rule, then in the houſe of a Lord or Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that will haue a rare to inſtruct them in all honeſtie. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if they may, they ſometymes looke to them, to the ende to iudge of their corruption or amendement, and according as they fiude to take them home, or leaue them ſtill abroade. And thirdly, not to ſuffer them to bée Pages aboue fower or fiue yéeres, then to kéepe them at home a while, ſo to make them forget whatſoeuer had they ſhall haue learned, and to confirme them in vertuous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauour, before they ſettle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any vocation wherein to continue.</p>

They perſwade themſelues, and not without reaſon, that the liberall Sciences are a great ornament to Nobilitie, and maketh it more worthie to adminiſter all publique functions: which is the cauſe that they ſeeke to haue them at the firſt watered with ſo good liquour. Howbeit this notwithſtanding, among many that there ſpend their youth, fewe doe reape any great profite: which procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of that that the fathers doe take them away ſo ſoone, euen at the tyme that they begin with iudgement and diſcourſe to attaine to the depth and conſideration of the excellencie of Sciences. And in my opinion, the chiefe cauſe that leadeth Parents ſo to doe, is for that they ſee that Eccleſiaſticall promotions are not giuen to the learned, but to thoſe that can beſt court the Cardinals and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, or the Kings fauourites: and the offices of Iuſtice in liewe of being conferred to the beſt deſeruer, are ſould to him that hath moſt money. This conſidered, and likewiſe perceiuing that the greateſt honors are gotten with the ſword, they will haue their children betymes to accuſtome themſelues to Armes. And peraduenture they are not herein altogether inexcuſable. One thing more there is that bringeth them out of taſte with keeping them long to ſtudie. That is, that when they come to conſider the countenances and ſimple and vnpoliſhed faſhions of Schollers in reſpect of the ciuilities, courteſies and dexterities of thoſe young Gentlemen that haue made but two iourneys to the Court, they thinke that their children ſhall neuer come tyme enough: who alſo for their partes neede no great force to fetch them from the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: becauſe the inclination to libertie, together with ſo many fayre bragges, whereat they leuell a farre of, which alſo the world preſenteth to their viewe, maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but too deſirous to get foorth.</p>

Herein cannot the parents better prouide, than with themſelues wel to aduiſe of what profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they will haue their children to be, to the end to accomodate their ſtudies to the ſame vocation: as beeing aſſured that hee that <note place="margin">Of thoſe that bring vp their children at home and of others that are forced to put them forth.</note> is vowed to the warre néede not to procéede ſo farre in ſtudie of the ſciences, as thoſe that thereby ſéeke to growe and inrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.

               <p>Other Gentlemen there be, who ſéeing diſorders euery where, had rather kéep their children at home, and there to ſpare for no ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends vnto ſufficient maiſters, than to ſend them forth. This is a good way for thoſe that be very rich, who alſo haue opportunitie to giue them companions of their owne age, with whom they profite better than being alone. But ſo cannot the poore that haue inough to do to cloth and feede theirs, whom alſo neceſſitie, as is aforeſaid, forceth to make them pages where they may: as wel to haue them faſhioned, as to eaſe their owne charges. It is ſufficiently knowen that there be many valiant Gentlemen of 7. or 800. Frankes rent, that haue foure or fiue children apeece ready growen, ſitting about their hearths, what can they do with them but intreat their friends that are better able than themſelues to giue them their finding and inſtruction, which is the moſt commodious way for them that they can chooſe: whereof doth inſue a great bond both of the Father and the child to him that ſheweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this curteſie, as alſo a great loue of him toward them, in that he findeth himſelfe to be thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the gouernment of others.

The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient lawgiuers that haue preſcribed lawes to all ſorts of common wealths, do will that children be taught in publike places, touching withall euery thing that is neceſſarie for them to learne, whereby to become vertuous and good citizens. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Politiks</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth therof at large, as alſo doth <hi>Plutarke</hi> in his <hi>ſmall works.</hi> They ſay that man conſiſting both of bodie and ſoule, muſt alſo be inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; exerciſed in that which belongeth to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both. For that neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the ſoule ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bleth in ignorance which is the mother of many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and by idleneſſe diſeaſes increaſe, and the body waxeth delicate and tender. Among the auncient nations in old time none were ſo curious in the well nurturing of their youth as the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> &amp; ſo long as they obſerued their cuſtomes, they had infinite ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perſons, yea, their women &amp; children became famous. The like affection ought to be among the kings that raigne in theſe daies, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially toward their nobilitie: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence do proceed their Princes, mightie Captains, gouernors, and chiefe officers, Embaſſadors and inferior Captains, whoſe ſeruice they vſe in defence of their crowns. For in caſe they deſire to reape worthie ſeruice of all theſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be men, they muſt firſt haue ſome care of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when they be children: becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince being y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon father of his ſubiects, ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that they be good. Whereof I do conclude that to the end to ſee good fruit proceed of the well nurturing of the Gentrie, the parents diligence only doth not ſuffice, but that it is alſo requiſite that publike orders do concur therewith, to the end that the one mixed with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a more proſperous iſſue maye inſue. In olde time our kings founded many goodly colleges, to the end al their ſubiects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly might be inſtructed as wel in diuine as humane learning. As alſo we may ſay that in olde time Princes houſes were ſchooles, wherein yong gentlemen were trained vp in ciuilitie &amp; good maners: when like wiſe the ordinances of the men of war did in parte ſerue to inſtruct them in martial feats. But now inaſmuch as in thoſe places they find not ſo exquiſite nurture as might be wiſhed for, it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8683:49"/>
to proceed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remedy propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it might pleaſe his maieſty in ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry parts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realm to eſtabliſh certain places dedicated to ſuch inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which beſides the ordinary fruit, might alſo yeld this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſhould not be driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo great expenſes, and vncertain ſucceſſe to ſend their children ſo far away, as hauing eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at their gates, as it were, moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſchooles of al good exerciſes: for there is neuer a yere but there go 3. or 400. yong Gentlemen out of <hi>France,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt of good houſes, into forein countries to ſée &amp; learne, which proceedeth of valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t minds with extreme deſire of knowledge. But euery thing wel waied, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid viages do breed more inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce than profit: For they cary y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coine out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realme, &amp; return fraught with vices: beſides that, of all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> go the one halfe do neuer returne, but are taken away either by ſickneſſe or other caſualties.</p>
               <p>It wer inough in my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> age of 15. yeres to places ſo ordained, becauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they begin to grow méet for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> require ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, &amp; that in the meane time vntil they come to that age, their fathers cauſe them to be taught either in their own houſes or at the vniuerſities. Theſe places whereof I meane to ſpeak, might be named <hi>Academies,</hi> wherof I wold in euery head city of this realm appoint one, were it not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are not yet diſpoſed to do too much good at once: &amp; therfore to begin withal, I would wiſh that 4. might be erected in the 4. quarters of the realm: which would moſt conueniently be at <hi>Paris, Bourdeaux, Lyons,</hi> &amp; <hi>Angiers,</hi> whether al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other prouinces might haue recourſe. Or it were not amiſſe to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in 4. of the kings houſes wherto the king doth but ſeldome repaire, namely, at <hi>Fontain beleau.</hi> The caſtle of <hi>Moulins.

In the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might be taught many kinds of exerciſes as wel for the bodie as the mind. For the body, to learne to backe a horſe, to run at the Quintain ſomtime armed, &amp; ſomtime vnarmed, to handle their wepo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to vault, &amp; leap, wherto might alſo be added ſwimming &amp; wraſtling, for al theſe make a man ſtrong &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>mble: Some <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes</hi> there are that would haue yong Gentlemen alſo to dance gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues only, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding dancing be but vain, ſo to learn to form the actions &amp; to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bolder grace abroad. Theſe alſo might be the exerciſes of the mind, which are no leſſe neceſſary than the reſt. To haue in our own language, lectures out of the auncient writers y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> intreat of moral vertues, policy, &amp; war. They might alſo be inſtructed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mathematiks, Geography, fortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſome moſt vſual languages. And this is profitable for a gentleman, I meane to know ſo much as he can make vſe of. Furthermore, becauſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s life
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:8683:50"/>
conſiſteth as well of trauaile as of reſt, it is méete y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his idle time be emploied in ſome honeſt occupations, to ſettle &amp; content his mind, leaſt it wander into bad cogitations and reſolutions. Which moued <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to wiſh young men to learn muſick: ſo as there ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be maſters appointed to that end: likewiſe to play vppon inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or to practiſe the penſill. And for the teaching of all theſe <note place="margin">Of maiſters and Rectors.</note> things, I thinke 8. or 10. maſters to ſuffice, who had néed to haue good ſtipends according to the ſeuerall qualities of the perſons. For euery one knoweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he that can teach to manage a horſe deſerueth more than a Painter. Likewiſe inaſmuch as it is requiſite to haue good orders in euery ſocietie, eſpecially in a houſe wher ſo many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons muſt meet, to the end that obedience &amp; ciuill honeſtie may the better be obſerued, it were good alſo to chooſe for thoſe foure places, as many vertuous Gentlemen to be ſuperintendents of the ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademies,</hi> to whom as well the maſters as ſchollers ſhould yeld al reuerence, who alſo ſhould ſée to the ordering of all things. Euerie of them to haue 2000. frankes maintenance, to the end to kéep reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence vpon the place. Neither ſhould their office continue aboue 3. or 4. yeres, which expired, to make choice of new. For if the youth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might haue recourſe thether ſhould not be ſo brideled, they woulde hardly beare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues modeſtly, conſidering the libertie that alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they begin to take. The authoritie alſo of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abouenamed might extend, ſéeing any lewd, &amp; as it were vncurable ſchqller, to banniſh <note place="margin">Expences.</note> him the <hi>Academie,</hi> &amp; to driue him thence. The charges for the maintenance of euery <hi>Academie</hi> wold not amount to aboue 3000 crownes, &amp; ſo the whole foure to 12000. by yere, which were but a ſmall matter in reſpect of the great fruit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> would ariſe of the ſame.</p>
               <p>But ſome good common wealths man will ſaie, that it were better to deuiſe how to diſcharge the king of his debts than to put him in <note place="margin">Confutation of a common obiection.</note> new charges. To whom I anſwere, that thus he ſhould pay one of the greateſt debts that he oweth, which is to adorne his nobilitie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vertue. Beſides that, who ſo liſt to looke well ſhall ſée an infinit nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of yéerely expenſes much worſe beſtowed. Howbeit, to the end not to burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the realme, which is alredie but ouercharged, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt way to do this, were to take the firſt benefices that ſhall fal w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out charge of ſoule, &amp; be in his Maieſties gift, &amp; out of them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point paiment. For as wel they be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuch as ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reuenues in prophane or rather ſo filthie vſes, as it is a ſhame to ſay. The clergy do ordinarily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the noble men catch at ſpiritual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, which then they would not do, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being inſtructed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8683:50"/>
and at their charges, they would not ſéeke to trouble publike order For thoſe that embolden themſelues to ſuch things, do it for want of good nurture. Afterward when the affaires of of <hi>France</hi> might <note place="margin">The execution and fruit of this order.</note> be brought into better order, the king might diſcharge the clergie of this bond.</p>
               <p>Now doth the difficultie reſt in the finding of ſo many maſters, For vnleſſe it bee at <hi>Paris</hi> the other townes are in a manner vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vnprouided. At the firſt peraduenture we muſt fetch ſome out of <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as can teach to manage a horſe, to vſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, or to vault, although I ſuppoſe that among the Prouinces there be many poore gentlemen ſufficient for this purpoſe. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe <hi>Academies</hi> ſhal haue ſtood thrée yeres in vſe, themſelues will haue framed more maiſters than wee ſhall néede. For the <hi>Frenchman</hi> is readie to learne artes and ſciences, eſpeciallie if hee ſée them in account, and that thoſe that haue ſkill bee maintained. Furthermore, notwithſtanding the maſters that ſhould teach, haue their ſtipends out of the common purſe, yet ſhould they not bée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from taking by permiſſion ſome honeſt rewards of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to the ende to make them the more diligent to teach them well. As alſo the ſuperintendent might to his beſt auaile boorde ſome young Gentlemen, which would redound to their benefite &amp; their parents commoditie. To bee briefe, there might be ſuch diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, that ſuch as ſhould commit anie diſhoneſt act, ſhould bee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, either by exhortations, puniſhmentes, or ſhame, as hath bene ſayd, to reforme them of their miſdemeanours. Perticulerlie to diſcourſe of the orders to be obſerued in theſe exerciſes were but ſuperfluous. Onely we ſhoulde thinke, that except the principall feaſts &amp; ſondaies, no daie ſhould be exempt from bodilie actions. It is alſo to be conſidered, that inaſmuch as the <hi>eſcuiry</hi> cannot haue horſes inow to teach all, euerie young Gentleman, eſpecially the rich, at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming ſhould bring one either broken or vnbroken. For either with the one or with the other they maye alwayes exerciſe themſelues. Beſides that, it wil be a commoditie to their parents to ſend their horſes to be there brokrn, whether great horſe or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. Neither doe I doubt, but by ſuch time as a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall haue continued foure or fiue yeres in ſuch a ſchoole, he wil be able to ſhew himſelfe in anie Princes court: For beeing ſkilfull in ſo many honeſt exerciſes, and withall inſtructed in other thinges that are not comprehended but by the vnderſtanding, who will not wonder at eighteene or nineteene yeeres of age to ſée ſuch toward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8683:51"/>
Now if either in the court or other where we ſée one indued with ſuch qualities, we like of him &amp; wiſh him good luck: What the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would we do if we ſhould ſée all the prouinces of the Realme plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in ſuch fruits. What a contentation might it bee to our king to ſée himſelfe inuironed with a nobility, not in name onely, but in vertue? As alſo what an honour for the parents that haue erected ſo goodly pillers for the vpholding &amp; glorie of their families? Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe our youth being thus inſtructed, we ſhall not néede to feare to ſend it into any place whereſoeuer, becauſe it ſhall be of good proofe: and in liew of ſpoiling it ſelfe, it ſhal chooſe the beſt in other places wherby to profit. Neither ſhal there néed aboue ſixe ſuch in a whole band of ſouldiours to bring the ſame into liking with all commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable exerciſes: whereas nowe for the moſte part they all imploy their vacaunt leiſure, either in trifling or hurtful paſtimes: ſo ſhold the aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies which ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meet in the prouinces to decide controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, or to leauy grayne, bee conuerted into ſweete and pleaſant contentions betweene yong gentlemen, ſometime in townes and ſomtimes in lords houſes, to runne at the ring, or to fight at barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with ſuch other exerciſes whereby to winne the priſes allotted to the moſt actiue: then would they alſo maintaine chalenges, and of theſe communications in ſo honeſt recreations ingender ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and fruitfull amity. I will leaue to the iudgements of ſuch as haue haunted the courts and warres, to note howe ſoone the yong men that I haue ſpoken of, will grow both good courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and better ſouldiers. For beeing already ſo well inſtructed in the actions both of the body and minde, ſuch a preparation would make them capable of that in two yeeres which others (who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the helpes of nature haue but ſmall learning) can not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in ſix. Finally the report of this good order beeing ſpred through forrein countries, we ſhould haue great reſort of ſtrangers to participate in the ſaide inſtructions, which woulde greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the glory of our country.</p>
               <p>This is one ſmall meanes in ſome ſort to keepe the vniuerſall corruption (which as an ouerflowing ſtreame ſeeketh to winne <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> ground) from further infecting of our nobilitie: Beſides we might conceiue this hope, that by continuance of ſuch an order we ſhould by litle and little ſee good manners reſtored. As alſo that age ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing youth ſo modeſt and wel taught would be afeard to tranſgreſſe and haue a greater deſire to vnderſtande what is worthy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Only it remaineth to perſwade his maieſtie to prouide ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8683:51"/>
theſe or better eſtabliſhmentes, which I aſſure my ſelfe, hee would not be againſt, in reſpect of that ſinguler affection which he beareth vnto his nobility, who hauing beene euer heretofore ready to ſacrifice their liues for his ſeruice, woulde be much more bent thereto when by new benefites their bands ſhall be encreaſed.</p>

Herewith were men fed for the ſpace of 500. yeeres, vntill our language growing more poliſhed, &amp; our mindes more tickliſh, they were driuen to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent ſome nouelties, wherewith to delight vs. Thus came y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bookes of <hi>Amadis</hi> into light amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs in this laſt age.

               <p>My iudgement therefore of theſe bookes in generall, ſhall bee <note place="margin">Thsir author.</note> this. I thinke (vnleſſe I be deceiued) that hee that compoſed them was ſome courtly Magitian, cunning &amp; ſlie, who to the end to bring his arte into eſtimation, and withall to procure vnto thoſe that bee dealers therein, both honour &amp; feare, hath cunningly fayned 1000. meruayles which he hath couered and wrapped vp in a number of pleaſant, deſired, and vſuall matters, ſo as the one running among the other, the whole might be the better receiued. I knowe there are ſome that will finde my opinion to bee verie ſtrange, becauſe they wéene that the author of the ſayde bookes intent was no other but to leaue to the poſteritie a portrayture of the exerciſes of the Courts in his time, and withall to forge a ſpurre wherewith to pricke forward young Gentlemen, and to incite them to entertain loue and practiſe armes, as the two onely moſt beautifull obiectes, that may delight, faſhion, and cauſe them to climbe to honour. But their iudgement is too ſimple, as ſtaying rather vppon the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the beautie of certaine outward matters, than vppon the truth of the inward. For notwithſtanding I graunt that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and examples of this fabulous hiſtorie, may alſo be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, to the end to teach both to loue and fight, yet will I ſaie that the moſt of thoſe loues are diſhoneſt, and almoſt all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats full of falſehood, and not to be practiſed, ſo that the following of thoſe rules is to walke in errour. All therefore that I pretend to ſhew may far better appeare by deducting the particularities that I haue noted.</p>
               <p>I will begin with the perſons of <hi>Alquif, Vrgand,</hi> and their like, inchanters and witches, there tearmed <hi>Sages,</hi> as alſo the Magicall <note place="margin">The proofe of the former point in the conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the firſt fruites of theſe books,</note> or deuilliſh arts which they vſed aſe called <hi>Perfect wiſedome.</hi> Yea I thinke if the author durſt he would haue named them <hi>Prophets,</hi> which name they deſerued, but with this tayle, <hi>of Satan.</hi> When theſe Sorcerers or Witches came to any Princes court, they were
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8683:52"/>

               <p>But I doe amiſſe in going about to ſpecifie their myracles. For we muſt imagine that <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Minerua</hi> in olde time did neuer ſo much as theſe.

For theſe kindes of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitians are accounted good and ſuccourable. But the author for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth alſo others, as <hi>Archalaus the Enchanter, Melie,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">The inetnt of the author of theſe bookes of Amadis.</note> more that delighted onely in dooing miſchiefe. Whereby we may eaſily perceiue that he maketh Magicke arts matters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, thinking them lawfull or vnlawfull, according as they be vſed well or ill. Yet, it ſeemeth hee allowe the vſe thereof among the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and diſalloweth it among <hi>Painims.</hi> Theſe doth he ſaie to haue drawen their knowledge out of the bookes of <hi>Medea,</hi> who in olde time was a notable ſorcereſſe. But his <hi>Vrgande the vnknowen</hi> he ſayth, to be inſtructed by the wonderfull precepts of <hi>great Apollidon,</hi> whom he faineth to haue ben as another <hi>Zoroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes,</hi> wherein he ſpeaketh better than he is aware. For <hi>Apollidon</hi> may be the ſame <hi>Apollion</hi> mencioned by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation, namely, the <hi>Deuil,</hi> whom we may ſaie to haue beene the common ſchoolemaſter to them all, becauſe that ſo pernitious arts, repleniſhed with fraude and lying, cannot procéede out of any other ſhop than his. We muſt therefore ſettle our ſelues, and beware we bee not ſnared in the writinges and perſuaſions of thoſe that after they haue maſqued and diſguiſed impietie, would harborowe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs who are to driue it awaie as a moſt horrible monſter.

               <p>Now let vs proceed to lay open ſome other bad drugs that are to be found in this ſhop. And in my opinion this may chalenge the 3. <note place="margin">The thirde fruict, named the poyſon of reuendge.</note> place, which is a miſerable cuſtome brought in by this author, who auoweth that the higheſt point of knights honour conſiſteth in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one anothers throate for friuolous matters. And of theſe tragedies he maketh a ſoueraigne paſtime for <hi>Kings, Ladyes, Courts,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cities.</hi> Oftentimes we ſee in the liſts the father againſt the ſon, the brother againſt the brother, the vnkle againſt the neuew, where when they haue hewen one vpon another two long houres, they haue both through faintnes fallen downe all tainted in bloud. Somtime he faineth they knew not one another, another time that they aſſailed each other to trie themſelues. But what groſe &amp; villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ignorance &amp; trials are thoſe which procure the perpetrating of ſo horrible paricides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It may be anſwered that they be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the great <hi>Apollion</hi> aforenamed, who beeing a murtherer from the beginning, delighteth wholy in committing of murther. In old time the <hi>Romanes</hi> toke pleaſure in forcing men to fight to outrance before them, but theſe were trangreſſors that had deſerued death. Where contrariwiſe ours are the ſonnes of <hi>Kings, Princes</hi> &amp; <hi>Lords</hi> that counterfait ſwordplaies: which can perſwade vnto youth that read theſe examples, nothing but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſtil muſt be figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with one or other, to the end to be eſteemed of &amp; feared.

               <p>I know I ſhall be accuſed of ouerſeuere cenſuring, or elſe of ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of our chronicler of <hi>Amadis:</hi> for whoſe iuſtification it wil be ſayd that in many places of his bookes he greatly extolleth <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>

But by that which he ſayth, it is to be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that he diſcourſeth not thereof but onely for a cloake to ſhroube himſelfe, and that he hath read but little in the Bible.

               <p>Finally, I will yet ſet downe one point concerning the exerciſe of armes, which hee maketh ſo vnlyke to common vſe, that it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a mockery and abuſing of youth in giuing them ſuch precepts: <note place="margin">The laſt fruict named parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſables.</note> for although the wiſer ſort do account ſuch knightly proweſſes and giantlyke ſtrength, wherewith the reader is ſo importuned, to bee but fables, yet the more vndiſcréete, vnder ſo ſweete a charme of wordes cannot forbeare, but remember ſome ſuch draughts as are moſt conformable to their affections, to the end afterward as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may ſerue to try them, thinking thereby to be more actiue than others. True it is that ſometime by the ſcoffes that they incurre, they are reclaimed from theſe errours. But wee are not to permit them to proceede to theſe experiences, but rather to propound vnto them true documents, and to hide from them the falſe, ſo to keepe them from failing. When a man hath beſtowed all his time in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the bookes of <hi>Amadis,</hi> yet wil it not all make him a good ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour or warriour.

Howbeit among all that I haue here ſaid, I doe not comprehende thoſe exerciſes in armes, which are the paſtimes of our nobilitie in time of peace, but contrariwiſe I do commend them, in that they are beſides the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure both honeſt &amp; neceſſary. And euerie one that liſt to cal to mind how during the raigne of good king <hi>Henrie the ſecond,</hi> through the frequenting of the ſame, they grew more expert and valorous, will endeuour to renue the practiſe thereof.

the world (more temperate than the fortunate Ilands ſo famous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the the ancients) wherein nature dooth moſt abundantly ſhed forth her pleaſures and delights. So as although ſhee hath not ſo much wealth as <hi>Spaine,</hi> who ſucketh the golden paps of both the <hi>Indies:</hi> though ſhe haue not ſo many Priuiledges as <hi>Pologne,</hi> which choſeth princes, &amp; beareth lordly dominion ouer her vaſſals: and although ſhe be not ſo ingenious as <hi>Italy</hi> which knoweth much dexteritie and curteſie, yet al this notwithſtanding, ſhe wanteth not wit inough to guide her, force inough to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d her, or welth inough to maintaine her.

To the end alſo the better to perceiue how the moſt part do ordinarily beare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. <note place="margin">Faults herein committed.</note> I will propound this example, namely of a Gentleman of 3 or 4000. frankes rent, already well entered into his youthful age, and formed according to our cuſtomes, which are but too eaſily lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. If he be in his own houſe, nothing will pleaſe him, neither can he euer be quiet vntill he hath ſet feather in the winde to go ſee the world, which deſire, if it be moderated, I do not blame: but I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlike his taſt of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he ſhould taſt better of. If he light vppon any court, where after he hath a while trotted vp &amp; downe, he hath attained a litle fame &amp; knowledge, hee thinketh it a ſmal matter, in reſpect of other ſtings that pricke him &amp; ſtill make him to loke for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but neuer behind him. Then comming to learn the vſe of his weepon, he ſtill thinketh his eſtate ouer baſe, and ſo aimeth at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine. If he chance to returne &amp; play the good huſband at home, &amp; that he haue laied the foundation of a compleat family, he wil not make ſo much account of his wife, children &amp; reuenues of his houſe as he ought, as taking the firſt goods to be ouer common, &amp; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ouer ſmall. Hauing attained to olde age, wherin hee ſhoulde after the tediouſneſſe of ſo long a iourney, take his reſt and reioyce that he hath gotten ſo neere to his ende, then is the time that moſt cares, anguiſhes, and feares doe greatly torment him:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:8683:56"/>
ſo as few things delight him though many diſpleaſe him, and thus doth he liue miſerably vntill be come to hide his head in his graue. Thus do we briefly ſee a ſmal portraiture of many mens liues, who becauſe they cannot well know the good they haue therein, doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy ſuch a benefit but coldly and without commoditie. Truly if eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one would often waigh the good wherof he may make account, he ſhould find the ſame as waightie as he thinketh them to be light. But when he caſteth it at his heels, like vnto forgotten ſinnes (as the prouerbe goeth) it yeeldeth but ſmall profite. The Philoſopher <note place="margin">Remedies for theſe faultes.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato</hi> ſayd, that he thanked <hi>God</hi> for three things: That he made him to be borne a <hi>Grecian</hi> &amp; not a <hi>Barbarian:</hi> an <hi>Athenian</hi> rather than the citizen of anie other towne: &amp; in the time of <hi>Socrates:</hi> but for how many things more y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſpeaketh not of, did he giue thanks? And in thus recording his felicities, his ſoule grew the more quiet &amp; ſatiſfied. The like ought we to do &amp; that often, to the end to baniſh our inſatiabilitie &amp; ingratitude, which without miſery doe make vs miſerable. And whereas ſome do think that after ſome ſort they do acquit themſelues hereof, yet if they looke wel, they ſhall find great difference between y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they do &amp; that which they ought to do. For they imitate not ſo much as <hi>Plato,</hi> in noting that which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon &amp; generall, but do ſtill addreſſe themſelues to ſome perticular thing that pleaſeth them. He that is ſkilfull in the arte of war; will thinke onely vpon that benefit whereby he atchieueth praiſe. The lawier will likewiſe dwell within the boundes of his knowledge, through the which he filleth his coffers. Neither wil the Marchant eſteeme of any other thing in himſelf, then his dexteritie &amp; dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which make his trafick to flouriſh. Al which conſiderations are not vtterly to be reproued. But euen as a banquet is not made with bread only without any other thing therto adioyned: ſo likewiſe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end the rather to ſatiſfie euery man with his owne eſtate, we are to ſet before our eies all whatſoeuer we can gather together, either the great or ſmall bleſſings that God hath bellowed vpon vs. And the more plentifull that we ſhall find them to be, the greater are we to account our felicitie. When we loke ouer our rentals, we find writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten great rents due vnto vs, asalſo a number of ſmal of a halfepeny and a farthing, which how ſmall ſo euer, we neuertheleſſe blot not out: becauſe that gathered together, they help to make perfect y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of our reuenues: no more are we likewiſe to race out of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance the leaſt benefite that we inioy, becauſe the thinking ther vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maketh our life the more ſweet &amp; pleaſant. The meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:8683:57"/>
well to graue in minde both great &amp; ſmall, is to ſteale fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſelues, &amp; to beſtow one onely halfe houre of the daie in the meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame. For ſtill we ſhall find ſo much new matter, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame will inuite vs cheerefully to labour in ſuch abundance.</p>
               <p>But in the obſeruation of this rule, it may bee there bee ſome who peraduenture would thinke to deale with <hi>God</hi> as they doe with men. For they are loth to ſift the pleaſures that they haue receiued, becauſe ſo they become debters: likewiſe that they would imagine, their entrie into ſuch accompts with him, (and theſe I rather terme ſmall and vnperfect recordations of his benefites, which wee are as well able to number as the ſtones of a Citie) to be an ouercharging of themſelues with obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; an oppreſſion of their miſtaken libertie. In theſe caſes are their imaginations falſe, and themſelues haue but ſmall knowledge of the nature of <hi>God,</hi> who aſſuredly at ſuch tyme as we moſt turne ouer the booke of receipts of his benefites, doth then giue vs moſt: becauſe that our ſmall preparations to acknowledgement doe mightely moue his liberalitie. It ſéemeth that I haue ſomewhat paſſed the bounds of my firſt ſpeech: but this digreſſion is not amiſſe, ſith that from Earth wee haue climbed into Heauen, which is the true ſpring from whence a whole <hi>Iliade</hi> of goodneſſe deſtilleth vpon vs, of the greateſt parte whereof, through our ſenceleſneſſe, wee are vtterly ignorant.</p>
               <p>Now will I returne to our Gentrie afore ſpoken of, who <note place="margin">Continuation of the reherſall of the good of the French Nobilitie to the ende to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to a trew enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof.</note> ſtraye fartheſt out of the way, whom alſo I would gladly bring backe to the right path: And this is it that I will ſay to them. <hi>Why doe you thus vexe your ſoules with a thouſand cares throughout the whole courſe of your life, vpon certaine conceiued phantaſies that your ſtate is vnperfect and full of blemiſhes? Open your eyes and throughly examine it, ſo ſhall it vaniſh and your ſelues bee better at reſt. When you walke vp and downe the Pallace of <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſo goe by the Painters ſhoppes, you can bee content to ſtay two whole ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers to gaze vpon ſome goodly peece of worke there ſet to view, which ſometyme mooueth you to commend both the worke and the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Much rather ought you ſo to deale with that goodly portraiture of your ſelfe, clothed in ſo many ornaments, for feare leaſt ignorance or inconſtancy ſhould cauſe you to be accuſed before the ſoueraigne Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which giueth to euery of his workes the comelineſſe that is proper and conuenient to the ſame. And as it is he that hath formed the Kings and Princes whom the Communaltie adoreth, ſo hath he with
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:8683:57"/>
the ſame hand moulded all thoſe whom pouertie oppreſſeth. All which vnproportionable diuerſitie is no let, but that the earthen veſſell is as profitable for the baſe and mechanichall vſe thereof, as is that of the fineſt and beſt wrought golde for the high and magnificent vſe of the ſame. Let vs now looke whether he hath bene nigardly and not boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull toward you. Truely you ſhall finde no: alſo that you muſt vtterly abandon thoſe your deceiueable thoughts: for they are the ſame which the auncient Serpent inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to deceiue our firſt mother. But it is your ſelues that are to be conuicted of ingratitude, in that you are contrary to the couetous man whoſe hart and eye are euermore in his coffers, where you neuer enter into the ſecret cloſets of your owne harts, to the ende to conſider of ſo many kindes of benefites incloſed: which if you would doe, you ſhould finde your ſelues not ſo poore as you weene for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will as it were by the way repeat ſome of thoſe which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <note place="margin">A recapitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome of theſe benefites.</note> you thinke leaſt vpon. And beginning with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirituall which are the principall, I will ende with the leſſer, that are more ſubiect to decay. If I ſhould now aſke you vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences how often in a wéeke you think vpon the ineſtimable benefite of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of <hi>God</hi> wherewith you are endued (for in that you are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> I cannot doubt thereof) you will peraduenture aunſwer me that it <note place="margin">The heauenly and ſpirituall.</note> were much if once in a moneth you ſhould earneſtly thinke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon: &amp; yet this knowledge, or rather faith, doth teach and certefie you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye are fellow burgeſes of heauen, &amp; that by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> you haue bene plucked out of the pawes of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great <hi>Pharao</hi> the deuill, &amp; the bondage of <hi>Egipt</hi> which is the figure of <hi>Hell</hi> How the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can you haue ſo ſmall mind of ſo excellent a benefite? whereof <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayd:</p>

                  <l>Of thy precepts I will ſtill muſe and thereto frame my talke,</l>

               <p>For notwithſtanding he had among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> treaſures y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had heaped together aboue 100. millions of gould, yet did he accompt thoſe of <hi>Gods</hi> ſeruice much more precious &amp; tooke greater felicitie therein. Imitate him therefore, &amp; oftner open the coffer of your vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and harts, to the end to contemplate ſuch ritches which onely ſuffice to make you happy. Next will I deſcend to morall vertues, <note place="margin">Vertues.</note> of ſome whereof I thinke you not vtterly vnprouided. And put the caſe you haue <hi>Fortitude,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>Proweſſe,</hi> which alſo is of great recommendation among our Nobilitie: alſo <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> which is familier with the good: Alſo I meane that the

portion which you haue be grauen in your harts, rather then prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in your faces. Euen with this onely may you bee aſſured that you ſhall not bee degraded from your title, notwithſtanding you ought ſtil to labour to obteyne more. You will not accompt a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of ſilkes poore, becauſe he hath in his coffers none but Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and white Ueluets, for you ſhould doe him wrong: euen ſo thinke of your ſelues that you are not poore in conditions, ſo long as theſe two vertues doe fructifie in you, which alſo may ſerue to engender more: Yea and the more are you to eſteeme of theſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, becauſe no furie of contrary fortune can bereaue you of them. I will alſo ſpeake one word of your <hi>Health,</hi> which me thinkes ye <note place="margin">Health.</note> cheriſh no more then ye doe adogge, whome ye hazard againſt all ſortes of wilde beaſtes: for many tymes you giue it for a pray to moſt mortall diſeaſes, wherein you ſhewe your ſmall iudgements in ſeeking to heape together vaine things, and yet cannot preſerue thoſe that are neceſſarie. Remember the prouerbe: <hi>There is no treaſure to health.</hi> And imagine a Prince groning in his bed, who offereth all his wealth for the recouerie of that which you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne. So will you peraduenture confeſſe that you are more happie then wiſe. As for your reuenues, your continuall lamenting of your <note place="margin">Ritches.</note> want doth ſhew that you are not very well content therewith: And yet is your rent perhaps twelue hundred crownes by yeere, with a goodly houſe, well furniſhed, where as your father liued honeſtly &amp; merely with the one halfe. You will either tell me, or thinke with your ſelues, that when you haue on your gay garments you are an other maner of man the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your father was. Truely I graunt it, &amp; I thinke your fathers head was fraught with wit that could of ſo ſmall wealth keepe his houſe furniſhed: Whereas contrariwiſe I ſuppoſe that your vnderſtanding is troubled with ſixe ounces of folly at the leaſt, conſidering that hauing ſo many commodities, your houſe is neuer but emptie, and yet I would wiſh you not to wéepe, for there bee at the leaſt fower millions of perſons in this Realme that haue not the tenth parte ſo much as you, and yet ſhed neuer a teare for it. You haue but ouer much if you could vſe it. What will you ſay of ſo many of your good <hi>Parents and Frends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And what accompt they make of you where you haue bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant? Yea, what will you ſay of your <hi>Libertie?</hi> which is a thing comparable to <hi>Life,</hi> through the which you may take pleaſure in the beautie of the ſeaſons, &amp; more in the conuerſation of men. You muſt needes aduowe that the poſſeſſions of theſe onely benefites

(notwithſtanding you poſſeſſe much more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I will note, as wel to auoyde flatterie, as not to bee tedious to the reader) doe ſuffice to make you bleſſe the giuer, content your ſe ues with your eſtate, and reioyce with other men: to which effects you ſhall atteyne by often meditation in the ſame. But if you diſdayne this profitable counſaile, and returne to your accuſtomed neglecting of that which is certaine to the ende to ſeeke the vncertaine, you will driue me to appropriate vnto you the deploration of the miſer and to ſay of you. <hi>Oh miſerable man! who in the middeſt of ſo much wealth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpteth himſelfe needie and poore!</hi> I haue ſayd enough, it is your partes to thinke vpon it.</p>
               <p>But I would wiſh euery man to knowe that this my admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion tendeth not to puffe vp the naturall pride of any that hath <note place="margin">The vſe of this diſcourſe.</note> conſidered of himſelfe, whereto many are eaſely led: but rather to reclaime thoſe that are too eager in the labourſome purſuite of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous goods, as alſo from their delicate complaints, in which waies I will not denye but my ſelfe haue heretofore walked as farre as others. But age, learning and ſiniſter experiences hauing ſtayed mee in the meditation of ſuch things as I haue noted and many more. I haue thereby learned, firſt that Gods liberalitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth toward vs, which wee neuertheleſſe by contempt of his goods do abuſe: and ſecondly that it is not altogether vnprofitable, when in the ende a man by his owne errors doth amend.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8683:59"/>
&amp; a few others that by good huſbandrie, benefites or couetouſneſſe haue mainteyned and enriched themſelues. And I dare affirme that if all that beare this title were deuided into tenne partes, and neerely viſited, it would bee found that eight of them haue bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed by the alienations of a great part of their goods, morgages of their landes, or other debts, and that onely the other two partes haue wherewithall ſufficiently to maintaine their eſtate wherein is no correſpondent proportion kept. I thinke I ſhould not doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe though I declared that which might ſeeme better to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. For as well our forreine neighbours doe imagine thriſe more then there is and ſay, that wee are ſo affected to our <hi>King,</hi> that we will according to our callings imitate his liberalities and expences. This therfore that I now ſpeake tendeth only to make vs wiſer and more readie to repayre our domeſticall decayes, as well to eſchue other mens ſcoffes as to expell ſundrie cares out of our mindes, and relieue thoſe wants that oppreſſe vs.</p>
               <p>Now, although it bee ſo that all doe agree in the confeſſion of <note place="margin">Originall of the pouertie of the Nobilitie.</note> this pouertie, yet when wee come to ſhewe how it commeth, there is a contrarie difference therein: For one ſaith one thing, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther another: yea euery one ſeeketh to accuſe the vyolence of the long warres which as Monſters doe deuoure all, rather then them ſelues. Thus doe wee ſee how readie each one is to ſeeke ſtarting holes whereby to cléere himſelfe of his fault, in liewe that he ought with vpright iudgement to examine from whence ſuch diſorders doe proceede. To excuſe a mans ſelfe is a very common matter, and ſuch as euery one is willing to doe: becauſe the excuſe ſeemeth ſomewhat to blot out the ſpottes that may blemiſh his good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme: But becauſe to accuſe bringeth ſhame, it is neuer put in practiſe vntill it needes muſt, whereof it falieth out that that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lyeth long hid in ignoraunce which ought ſooner to haue bene knowne. The prouerbe falleth out many tymes true, which ſayth: <hi>That the euill which we knowe well is as it were halfe healed.</hi> Let vs <note place="margin">Referred to the warres.</note> therefore ſeeke the cauſe of our owne, and that will be to vs a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die way and preparation to finde remedie. Thoſe that doe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to the ruine and charges of warre, doe ſay that there be yet liuing many honorable perſons that haue ſeene in what wealth and proſperitie the <hi>French Nobilitie</hi> liued vntil the tyme of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the ſecond:</hi> For ſo long as we had peace there was nothing to be ſeene among the Lords &amp; Gentrie but liberalitie, magnificence, viſitations, with other ſuch honeſt expences, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> witneſſes of wealth.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8683:59"/>
And yet all this notwithſtanding they ſould no landes, as well for feare of reproach, as alſo becauſe of the moderation vſed in ſuch things. Likewiſe, whenſoeuer there was any warre proclaymed, it will hardly bee beléeued what goodly furniture euery one caried with him, as appeared in the voyadge into <hi>Germanie.</hi> But as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this world is long permanent, ſo in the warres that were renewed in the yeere 1552. betweene the Emperour <hi>Charles the fifth and King Phillip,</hi> which laſted ſeuen yeeres, it was driuen to great expences, as well for the ſelfe honor, as in reſpect of the loue it bare to ſo good a Prince as was <hi>King Henry.</hi> Then enſued the vniuerſall ciuill warres all ouer the Realme, comparable to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtreames, which ſo encreaſed the ruine thereof, that now all that the Nobilitie is able to doe, is to maintaine it ſelfe, liuing mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably in it owne houſe. And hereof is growne the pouertie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Theſe be their reaſons, which alſo I will not vtterly reie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For <note place="margin">This pouertie hath other ſpringes then the warres.</note> I will ſtill confeſſe that theſe ſtormes haue bred part of our pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but that it is wholly procéeded thereof, I doe not aduowe: and I will hereafter ſhewe that it had other helpes of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to ſet it forward. So as their argument concludeth but in parte. Now let vs examine what may haue bene the ruine in the firſt warres. It was not great, for the Nobilitie that then ſerued were neither euill paide, neither deſtitute of honeſt rewards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding of the Kings liberalitie. True it is that ſome perticulers being too forward did in parte vnfeather themſelues, as alſo that the frontier Nobilitie encurred ſome loſſes. But the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber continued in good ſtate. In the ciuill warres there fell out more loſſes, which neuertheleſſe lighted not vpon vs. Beſides that in our pettie peaces ſince concluded it had ſtill meanes to repayre the breaches. Withall that <hi>France</hi> is ſo fruitfull and well peopled, that whatſoeuer the warre waſteth in one yéere is repayred againe in two. Sith therefore ſuch diſcommodities haue ſtill bene accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſome remedies, as alſo that they haue aſſayled but the leaſt parte of the Nobilitie, wee are not to accompt this miſchiefe either ſo vniuerſall or great. But, in my opinion, the cauſe why all the blame is layd vpon the warres, is firſt becauſe the ſame is by nature hurtfull: ſecondly, that the vyolence that moueth it is hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and terrefieth: and thirdly, becauſe men are glad to haue a ſhroude to hide their euill huſbandrie, or els artificially to pleade pouertie as the couetous doe.

and feare the like diſeaſe, and yet the corruption of the humours whereof it proceeded did growe by little and little through his intemperance of life, whereof he tooke no heede. The like doe wee in thinges breeding our pouertie. For ſome there are that wee finde out by and by and they make vs to lament: but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which are neither ſo common nor agreeable with vs, wee let eaſely ſlippe, as if wee were inſenſible, and will not knowe them. And I dare affirme that if the ruines of warres and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall charges that ſo wee complaine of, haue brought vs fower ounces of pouertie, our fooliſh and ſuperfluous continuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences which wee doe not greatly repent vs of, haue procured vs twelue.</p>
               <p>In this propoſition we are to conſider that the <hi>French</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth excéede in any thing whereto he is affected, and will ſpare <note place="margin">Superfluous and exceſſiue expenſes in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel, the only ſpring of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie.</note> for nothing. Then that moſt of them ſpend not in one thing only, but in fower or fiue, ſo diuers are their minds, and that is the cauſe that drieth vp the liuelieſt ſprings of ritches. Now, one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall thinges wherein they ouerflowe is apparell, wherein they haue neither rule nor meaſure: yea cuſtome hath wonne ſo much, that a man dare not almoſt appeare in any good companie vnleſſe he be guilt like a Challice: for thereby many perſwade themſelues to bée the more honored.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Courtiers</hi> were they that brought in theſe inuentions, who in the meane tyme doe ſharpe pennance for their labours, in that there is no yéere but ſuch large expences doe ſende at the leaſt one doſen of them into the <hi>Litter,</hi> who for the pleaſure of ſeeing themſelues a fewe daies couered with ſilke and ſiluer, muſt many moneths after beare the griefe of finding themſelues houſeleſſe, or ſo haled by Uſurers, as they could not be worſe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gallies. Two other things there be beſides the ritches of apparell, which greatly encreaſe charges. The one, that men will haue diuerſitie: the other, that from two yéeres to two yéeres the faſhions doe chaunge and muſt be renued, &amp; who ſo doth not frame himſelfe hereto is laughed to ſcorne. To be briefe, either the hand muſt ſtil be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purſe, or the land at gage. Next to the <hi>Courtiers</hi> come the <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who are not altogether ſo exceſſiue as they, although they take paynes to imitate them. And as for thoſe that neuer ſtirre out of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, vnleſſe it be a few very good huſbands, they likewiſe do ſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the cuſtome, that euery one farre excéedeth his porte. And yet is all this but halfe charges. For the women alſo will haue
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:8683:60"/>
their ſhare in ſo many gay ornaments, which yet became them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the men, who haue larger meanes to beautifie themſelues with vertue. Some are content with honeſt ſufficiencie, others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light onely in aboundance: and ſome doe ſo farre paſſe the boundes of reaſon, that their poore huſbands may ſcratch their heads when they ſee pouertie come poſting to them vpon <hi>Indian ſtones, and Italian clothes of golde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This cuſtome began vnder <hi>Frances the firſt,</hi> and did mightely encreaſe vnder <hi>Henry the ſecond:</hi> but ſince, their exceſſe hath bene ſuch, as to apparell their Lackies and Pages in cloath of ſiluer. Our aunceſtors were without compariſon farre more moderate, yea our <hi>Kings</hi> ſought to make their Maieſties venerable rather by <hi>grauitie, iuſtice, wiſedome, fortitude, liberalitie, and a trayne of worthie and learned perſonages,</hi> then by any ſumptuouſneſſe of apparell, which alſo inuited their ſubiects to the like imitation. <hi>Subiects and Prouinces</hi> enſue the maners of <hi>Princes.</hi> And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the great ones doe begin to cut off theſe ſuperfluities, they will ſtill continue to the great detriment of the Nobilitie.</p>
               <p>Some man may ſay: Is it not decent that euery one ſhould goe according to his dignitie? Yes truely, and I thinke it were great inciuilitie and an vnwoorthie matter to doe otherwiſe. I reprooue only the exceſſe therein vſed, which puffe vp our mindes to vanitie, and in the ende breede deſtruction. Neither muſt we imagine that our fathers went apparelled like Artificers: For when they came to any Feaſts or great aſſemblies, their garments were according to their calling: and yet free from ſuperfluitie, and ſuch as laſted long. Now, if in the Court we ſee any man weare a garment of a yeere olde, we ſay of him: <hi>We know him well enough, he will not bite vs, he is a two yeeres birde:</hi> ſo that with ſuch ſcoffes he is forced to giue it ouer. And it may be ſayd that among <hi>Courtiers</hi> the age of an ordinarie garment is three moneths: and of an extraordinarie, ſixe: and among the reſt of the Nobilitie, ſomewhat longer tyme. For the newe fangles that doe after enſue doe make them ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. To the ende likewiſe the better to knowe the diuerſitie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, reſort you to the <hi>Frippery</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> where you ſhall finde a moſt plentifull ſtorehouſe. So that if a man were diſpoſed vpon this medlie to frame Antiques, there were no pleaſanter deuiſe to bee ſeene. This inconſtancie in apparell argueth a woonderfull light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of minde, whereof enſueth the purgation of the purſe, and laughing ſport to ſtraungers. For when we come into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:8683:61"/>
and they ſee our <hi>great Ruffes, womens Verdugalles, mens long heare,</hi> and the <hi>ſword at the backe,</hi> they runne after them as the little children at <hi>Paris</hi> do after maiſter <hi>Gonin.</hi> It is a hard caſe to empoueriſh our ſelues with theſe péeuiſh follies, and then to bee laughed to ſcorne too.</p>
               <p>It may bee replyed that ſcoffes, the ordinarie paſtime of the world, are mutually lent and payed againe: alſo that our Nobilitie <note place="margin">Againſt ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

I denye it not: but withall, this I will ſay, that when ſome of them doe afterward come to conſider that the ſimplicitie of their garments ſwelleth vp their coffers with treaſure, alſo that wiſedome and grauitie ſhine in their Senate, and that their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes are inuiolably obſerued: and contrariwiſe that wee with our ſhort hoſe and long dublets haue made our lawes leape out at the windowes, becauſe they ſpeake too loude: alſo that our coffers are for the moſt part as voyde of golde as the head of a paſſionate lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is of reaſon, they conclude that our ſelues doe better deſerue to be mocked.</p>
               <p>Let vs now come to the ſecond article of our vayne expences, <note place="margin">Expenſes in building.</note> conſiſting of the immoderate affections that ſundrie beare vnto <hi>ſtately buildings.</hi> For although it hath bene ſo from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet was it but little in reſpect of our tyme, wherein we ſee the qualities of the buildings and the number of builders farre to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the olde tyme. And eſpecially our Nobilitie haue therein exceeded, rather vpon vayne glorie then any neceſſitie. I ſuppoſe it is not much aboue threeſcore yeeres ſince that <hi>Architecture</hi> was reſtored in <hi>France,</hi> where before men lodged but groſſely. But ſince that the faire fruites of this arte hath bene reuealed, many haue endeuoured to put them in practiſe. If none but great or ritch men had employed onely the aboundance of their Crownes vpon ſuch workes, it had not bene to be reproued, conſidering they were ornaments both to towne and countrie. But after their example the meane wealthie perſons, yea euen the poore haue coueted to ſet hand to the worke, and as it were at vnwares haue bene forced to doe much more then they thought for: and that not without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce.</p>
               <p>The Lawyers likewiſe and eſpecially the Treaſorers haue likewiſe encreaſed the deſire of the Lordes to building. For ſay they: <hi>How is this? Theſe men that are not ſo well grounded as wee
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8683:61"/>
doe build like Princes, and ſhall we ſit ſtill?</hi> So as it were vpon ſpite one at an other, we haue a multitude of goodly houſes made and that oftentymes with the loſſe of the reuenues, which are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to other men, through that vehement paſſion that vrged them to heape vp ſtone vpon ſtone. How many haue there bene that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing begunne ſtately buildings, haue left them vnperfect, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing learned to bee wiſe in the middeſt of their follie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In euery Prouince wee ſee but too many examples. It may bee that ſome when they haue ſeene themſelues ſo well clothed and ſpangled in golde, haue ſaide: <hi>This cage is too narrowe for ſo fayre a foule, it muſt haue a more ſtately one.</hi> To which diſcourſe ſome flatterer may haue replyed. <hi>Sir, it is a ſhame your neighbour, who is no better then your ſelfe ſhould be better lodged. But take hart, for he that beginneth bouldly hath finiſhed halfe his worke, neither can a wiſe man want habilitie.</hi> Then he feeling himſelfe clawed where it itched, by and by in his minde conceiued a purpoſe which he began with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, continued with labour and charges and ended with ſorrowe. So as it hath often fallen out, ſuch a one hath builded a houſe fit for a Lord of 25000. Franckes rent, whoſe heire hath not found aboue ſeuen or eight hundred, and being aſhamed to lodge his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie ſo ſtately, hath ſould it to buy an other more fit for his liuing. And him that would not ſo ſell, to bee driuen <hi>to feede vpon ſmall loues,</hi> as wee ſay, and when his friends came to viſite him, <hi>to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them with diſcourſes of Architecture.</hi> When <hi>Fryer Iohn of Antomeures</hi> (who was one of the pleaſanteſt Monckes of his tyme) entred into any of theſe ſo ſtately houſes or Caſtles, finding but a leane kitchin, he vſed to ſay. <hi>Oh! to what purpoſe are all theſe goodly Towers, Galleries, Chambers, Halles and Cloſets, ſith the caul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons are ſo colde and the ſellers ſo emptie? By the Popes worthie pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofle,</hi> (for that was his accuſtomed oath) <hi>I had rather dwell vnder a ſmall roofe, and out of my chamber heare the melodie of the ſpits, ſmell the ſauour of the roſt, and ſee my cubbord garniſhed with flagons, pots and goblets, then to dwell in theſe great Pallaces, to take large walkes and picke my teeth fasting after the neopolitaine maner.</hi> I like of their opinion that counſaile that if any will build, it be vpon condition that he ſell little or none of his goods: And who ſo doth otherwiſe I referre him to the cenſure of <hi>Fryer Iohn of Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meures.</hi> I knowe that one of the ſingularities in <hi>France</hi> is the ſtately buildings diſpoſed ouer the fieldes, which is not els where to bee ſeene. But he that ſhould withall reckon how many men
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8683:62"/>
theſe magnificencies haue ſent to the wallet, would ſay it were déere ware.</p>
               <p>The third article that here I minde to ſet downe is a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the exceſſe afore going. For when a Gentleman hath <note place="margin">Expenſes in moueables.</note> built a goodly houſe, it is not all: he muſt garniſh it with mooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables conuenient: otherwiſe it were but as a body without a ſoule. So that if he were earneſt to haue it finiſhed, he is no leſſe eager to furniſh it within, and ordinarily curioſitie ouercommeth all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of things neceſſary. He cannot reſt till he hath gotten <hi>Flemiſh hangings and millan beds:</hi> and thereto will euen his friend prouoke him: reſpecting rather at vnawares the beautifying of his follie, then the bottome of his purſe which many tymes is but flat.</p>
               <p>In olde tyme if a Gentleman together with his wiues good huſwiferie, at the ende of his daies left his houſe well furniſhed to his Children, it was a great matter. Now wee are ſo haſtie, that in two yéeres wee muſt haue it decked vp, which impatiencie hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth much: as therein obſeruing neither tyme, quantitie nor qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of things: but onely noting what our neighbour doth, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfying our owne deſire without meaſuring of our habilities. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man delighteth to ſee a proper houſe and handſomely fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: But it followeth not therefore that it is neceſſarie to haue ſuch ritch mooueables. For handſomneſſe conſiſteth in well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of thoſe thinges that wee haue, conioyned with clenlineſſe. Wee doe ordinarily ſee the houſes of ſimple Burgeſes and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, euen in the lowe Countries, ſo handſomely decked vp, and that with little, that Noblemen might be aſhamed to keepe theirs ſo foule, <hi>and it is only care and diligence</hi> (things of ſmall price) that doe breede this.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lord Marſhall of S. Andrewes</hi> was moſt ſumptuous in precious moueables, which cauſed diuers <hi>Princes, Lords, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and others,</hi> to endeuour to imitate him in ſuch inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble magnificence, to the ende they might bee wondered at as he was, but ſome of their Children haue bewayled their fathers fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: and this complaint hath encreaſed when byting vſurie with her long talents hath catched euen out of ſome Princes Caſtles ſuch ritch booties.</p>
               <p>The fourth article that I haue reſerued to ſpeake of, is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity <note place="margin">Expenſes of mouth and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer great rete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.</note> of the mouth expences, and the ouer great traines of moſt of the Nobilitie: wherein reſteth no leſſe diſorder then in the reſt.

Others alſo that delight in good companie, haue a great care to haue their tables alwaies well furniſhed. Now is there nothing wherein we vſe leſſe repugnance then in that contention which euery one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in himſelfe to vſe either the one or the other: Neither were it much to bee miſliked in the Nobilitie in caſe they excéeded not the bounds of their habilitie, but it is in them ſo eaſie a matter to faile of that, that of tenne you can hardly finde two that can bridle themſelues therein. Among thoſe that meane to followe the Court or Armes, there bee fewe but eate vp their whole reuenues of one yeere, ſome in ſixe moneths, and ſome in eight, by reaſon of their great traynes and other expences. And although ſome maintaine or enritch themſelues in ſuch places, the number is but ſmall: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe that be benefited by the King or Princes: or thoſe that in the warres doe helpe them ſelues with the large priuiledges thereof, yet all the reſt doe feele the diſcommodities, in reſpect of the continuall charges that they are compelled to be at. Which notwithſtanding, fewe doe amend, but contrariwiſe ſtill they ſeeke ſome newe occaſion of expences. What hath moued aboue three hundred Gentlemen yet liuing importunately to ſue vnto our Kings to giue them the order of <hi>S. Michell,</hi> ſaue onely a deſire to encurre newe charges, to the ende not to diſgrace their newe dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. Howbeit, there be aboue a hundred who finding that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation thereof led them the hye way to the Hoſpitall, haue layd vp their collers in their coffers, and moderating their vertues haue taken vpon them again their auncient courſe of life, and haue found eaſe therein. Who ſo likewiſe will count the <hi>Gentlemen of the Chamber,</hi> and <hi>of the bodie, the Eſcuryrie: the Coronels and Captaines,</hi> that likewiſe are more then we thinke for had, neede to ſtudie, <hi>Arithmeticke.</hi> But thinking that ſome of them are to their coſtes growne wiſe, I wil now ſay no more. Neither wil I thinke but the ſeeking of offices proceedeth from ſome ſpring: Namely, from a deſire that the Nobilitie hath to be well accoumpted of and to encreaſe. But their iudgement is amiſſe, to think that a dignitie may make a man worthie of honor, which is not truely atchieued but by vertue. As for thoſe that for the moſt part doe n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

But to what purpoſe doe ſo many gay garments, with ſo large and well furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a houſe ſerue, if a man haue not alſo a great trayne to make himſelfe bee termed <hi>My Lord?</hi> They may for their diſcharge ſay that their fathers had not half ſo much rent as they, which is true. But withall that which then coſt but fiue ſouze coſteth now twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. As alſo it is but an abuſe to relye vpon ſome ſmall encreaſe of rent, and to haue no conſideration of other diſcommodities. An auncient man ſpeaking of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> hauing noted the maner of their life, ſayd: <hi>That they built as if they ſhould neuer dye, and in their almoſt ordinary banquets, fed as if they ſhould liue but one day.</hi> I thinke that among vs there bee the like which put the ſame in practiſe: but if the Ciuill warre holde but a while, it will cure them well enough of this diſeaſe. I might yet note many other exceſſiue charges that moſt of the Nobilitie is at, in matters breeding plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yea I might frame a fifth argument, but I will forbeare, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to their iudgements that knowe what it is worth, how much money is ſo conſumed.

               <p>Yet haue we not much vſed it: but how ſhould wee doe it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that notwithſtanding wee feele the miſchiefes euen vpon our ſhoulders, we can hardly bee brought to amendment? It were enough to breede ſhame, that a Gentleman for the leaſt occaſions of expence that happeneth ſhould be driuen to ſell or morgage his land, who then perſwadeth himſelfe that a ſmall debt is but a ſmall matter. Which alſo I will graunt him, but when he continueth in doing it againe, as it oft happeneth in tenne yéeres, he afterward findeth that all theſe ſmall peeces gathered together doe make a great hole.

In this our age wherein wee liue, it is impoſſible for anie to exempt themſelues from warre, becauſe ambition, couetouſneſſe, and reuenge, are as fruitfull as euer they were to ingender the ſame: and when it comes, good men doe ſwallowe it lyke a moſt bitter pill.

               <p>Moreouer, theſe perpetuall warriours doe (as much as in them lie) ſhake off all ſuch dueties as are moſt requiſite in a good Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, as that to their Countrie, wherein they ſtaie no longer than it is troubled, &amp;c. to their parents whome ſome doe, after they are growen prowd by armes, diſdaine becauſe of their pouertie.

The <hi>French</hi> ſouldiour ought in warre to ſerue his king, and his Countrie, and when peace commeth he muſt ſeeke, if hee may, to get into the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayned bandes, whereto if hee cannot reatch, hee ſhould not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe vppon a deſperate minde, caſt himſelfe headlong into vnconſiderate enterpriſes, as if the Realme were not able to keepe him, or himſelfe to finde meanes whereby to liue in the time of peace.</p>

               <p>I will alſo aduowe that among vs he that hath ſome long time profeſſed armes, delighteth in them, and is in the waie to attaine thereto, in ſeeking a place among the ſtanding companies, or ſome other good fortune, dooth but his dutie. But when ſuch commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties fayle him, hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>uſt not thinke himſelfe diſhonoured though he labour for the maintainance of himſelfe and his familie, if he haue anie, as euen to this daie they doe in <hi>Germanie, Zuitzerland, and Flanders.</hi> All theſe ſo common exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples ſhould rather induce thoſe that be gone affraie to imitate them, than to doe as they doe. But if anie doe thinke that the ſetting vp againe of their occupations, doth abaſe them, let them goe ſerue the Gentlemen. Which in my opinion they cannot refuſe to doe, conſidering how the poorer ſorte of gentlemen can ſettle themſelues to that calling: howbeit if they be out of taſt herewith, they muſt be let runne, and tarie till time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them.</p>
               <p>We lykewiſe finde ſome of the bodie of the Gentrie, who mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by diuerſe reaſons doe alſo ſet the feather in the winde, and go <note place="margin">Of French Gentlemen that goe to ſerue in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein countries.</note> to ſeeke the like aduentures. Among which the youth is moſt to bee excuſed, who driuen by a certaine deſire to learne and to winne credite, doo goe whereſoeuer occaſion may ſerue. They wanting iudgement to diſcerne which enterpriſes are lawfull and which not, ſo ſoone as the winde bloweth in the ſayles of theyr deſires, which are large, doe ſpred them, and ſo are eaſily carried awaie. It is pittie ſo many are loſt in ſuch places, where beeing neither kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen nor guided, they paſſe vnder the miſeries of the multitude. Thoſe that haue authoritie ouer them ought to be careful to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle them well.</p>
               <p>Others there are whome pouertie driueth from home: for bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing noble, the exerciſes of Mechanicall artes and traficke woulde turne to their reproch, and therefore they muſt ſeeke the liberall and honourable, among whome weapons doe walke. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe though this profeſſion bee conuenient for them, yet muſt they not abuſe it as they that I haue ſpoken of. For ſo are they the more to be blamed, in that the noble Gentleman is ſtraightlyer bound
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8683:68"/>
to liue vertuouſly than the peaſant. What ſhall hee then doe, if you will not let him ſeeke his fortune? I anſwere, that in our <hi>France</hi> poore Gentlemen haue no cauſe, as deſperate perſons, to take di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe partes, conſidering what meanes they haue to attayne to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and wealth.</p>
               <p>Firſt the men of armes were inſtituted for the maintainance of theſe, to the end theyr valour ſhould not periſhe, but bee reſerued for the benefite of the ſtate. Then haue they the Eccleſticall offices whereto they may aſcend, as alſo the iuſticeſhip which in olde time they exerciſed. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendatories of <hi>Malta</hi> do alſo releeue ſome: likewiſe the ſeruice of Lordes with whome not onely they were brought vp as pages, but alſo being men they haue their maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is a good refuge for them.</p>
               <p>Finally, the bands of footmen doe retaine many. Wherefore the wiſe ſhould rather ſettle themſelues to the beſt of theſe, than by thinking to profite abroade to looſe their liues. Some will ſaie that death catcheth not ſo many as wee ſpeake of, but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue themſelues: for I haue noted the number to be greater than we weene for, &amp; of meere compaſſion that I take of them, I would that through good inſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>utions or other remedies, the miſchiefe might bee preuented. Yet doe I not meane that orders ſhoulde be ſo ſtrict, that none may go forth without leaue. For in ſuch a great populous kingdome as this, that lawe cannot be eſtabliſhed. And if there were but foure or fiue hundred voluntaries as well of the Gentrie as communaltie, that of theyr owne perticular motions would yeerely go into the warres, as foule to theyr haunt, it were but a ſmall matter &amp; not to be ſpoken of. But there go many more of that ſorte as I haue ſayd. And many Gentlemen alſo of account and greate credite who are readie inough to march: and whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they moue, they incite many other. Wherfore before they ſo do, it were theyr parts well to examine the cauſes, which being vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as being moued by nothing but their owne profite or honour, they ſhew that they haue ſmall care of their friends, in counſailing them thoſe things that tend more to their own particular intereſt, than to common equitie. In this caſe men muſt be wiſe to chooſe rather than willing to depart.</p>
               <p>Now are we to looke what fruite our Nation reape of theſe martiall voyages, which they take vppon them rather of iolitie <note place="margin">Of the fruites of theſe marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all voyages.</note> than any good foundation. I take it to bee verie ſmall. Firſt in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe dayes moſt of them through the libertie of ciuill warres, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8683:69"/>
growen into wonderfull diſcordes, going abroade, doe nothing but laie open theyr imperfections, which they ſhould ſeeke eyther to amend or hide. Some are blaſphemers of God: others adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, quarellers, and diſſolute perſons, and many diſobedient to their Captaynes: of whome lykewiſe ſome do eyther for their owne profite or through ignaraunce breake good lawes and order. So as when men ſee that the effects bee not anſwerable to the French name, they growe of liking with them.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, thoſe people that are driuen to beare theyr in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies, I meane of the lawleſſe, not of the modeſt, (albeit euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more there bee good and valiant men mingled among the greate number) doe growe to hate the whole Nation for the mallice of ſome, thinking it incompatible: and in their harts doe powre forth continuall curſes agaynſt the ſame: ſo as although there be ſome Captaines, Gentlemen, and Souldiours, who through theyr good behauiours doe become agreeable vnto them, yet are they not able to ſuppreſſe the generall miſlyke. And heere is yet another incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience, namelie, that if there happen anie miſhappe in the warre, rather through the ſtrength of the enimie, than anie preſumption or inſufficiencie of the Captaines, eyther through the diſobedience or ſmall valour of the ſouldiours, than doe the peoples tongues euen teare in peeces thoſe whome hauing begunne to hate, they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde vtterly contemne.</p>
               <p>Now it is moſt certayne, that in this counterfaite diſcipline loſſes are as common as good ſucceſſe or rather more. Which truelie ſhoulde make theſe that haue charge to beleeue, that it is harde to eſcape ſtumbling in ſo rugged a quarrie. Whoſoeuer therefore purpoſeth to goe on warrefare in a foreine Countrie, let him make greate account of vertue, for according to the ſame hee ſhall be eſteemed, and many times a little ſhall bee accounted off. Whereas contrariwiſe if men cary new vices, eſpeciallie ſuch as offende, no man will receiue them for ſeruauntes, much leſſe for Maiſters: and without affoording them anie thing, will laugh at them, &amp; which is yet worſe, they ſhall be feared as much as if they were open enimies.</p>
               <p>This together with the miſeries afore touched maketh mee to <note place="margin">Armes ought eſpecially in a forren contry to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with vertue.</note> beleeue that vntill that manners and martiall diſcipline bee in better ſtate among the French nation, they ſhall atchieue ſmall credite and leſſe good will among our neighbours whome they ſhall goe to ſerue. Truelie it is in vaine to thinke that force one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:8683:69"/>
can worke anie greate effects: for not beeing accompanyed with iuſtice, faith, and modeſtie, it is vnperfect. But by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of vertue the heart is wonne, which is a ſure and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conqueſt, examples whereof the <hi>Romaines</hi> haue lefte vnto vs.</p>
               <p>I knowe well inough that as well the Gentleman as the Souldiour maye obiecte to thoſe that ſet them on worke manie things worthie conſideration: namelie, that they hazarde theyr liues, receiue bodilie woundes, ſpende their goods, and endure great paine for their ſeruice: all which will neuertheleſſe looſe their grace and bee of no account, if theſe deprauations continue. For the people whome the Souldiours dooth oppreſſe will not ſo much excuſe them for defending of them, as they will curſe them for deuouring them, as burying the remembrance of the benefite in the ſmart of the euils. But thoſe that performe theyr duties to the beſt of theyr powers as well in fighting as in good life, they loue and excuſe.</p>
               <p>Some will ſaie, in theſe foreine warres that they they go to ſeeke, <note place="margin">Aunſwere to certaine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections.</note> they may learne much. I confeſſe it: But withall wee muſt note, that from the ſiege of <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> which was the notableſt in our time, there eſcaped but tenne <hi>French</hi> Souldiours, and not foure from that of <hi>Harlem,</hi> in which two Townes there were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, as I haue heard.</p>
               <p>I am not ſo ignoraunt but I knowe that the propertie of warre is ordinarilie to deuour at the leaſt the fourth parte of thoſe that followe it: but when of the fiue partes it catcheth foure, as often times it doth, is it not too rauenous? This haue I ſayde to the end that thoſe that goe as vnfeathered boultes into places of great noiſe, may remember y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eaſely they depart, but verie hardly returne agayne. Thoſe that weene that when <hi>France</hi> hath had peace for two or three yeeres, ſhe ſhoulde neuer haue warre agayne, doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue themſelues. For if they conſider what hath paſſed ſince the yeere 1494. they ſhall ſee that ſhee hath not beene long in reſt ſince.</p>
               <p>To be briefe, they that bee wiſe (if they will follow my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile) ſhal enter into theſe voluntarie purpoſes with leaden heeles, yea, euen the Gentlemen, as calling to minde that to goe raſhlie and put their liues in more dangerous than neceſſarie aduentures, (which they ſhoulde neuer doe but vppon good occaſions) is an
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8683:70"/>
argument of French raſhneſſe, an engendering of parents teares and a weakening of the ſinowes of the ſtate. But when theyr en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes are vnderpropped with iuſtice, and that the lawe full commaundements of Kinges wealthes doe ſet in foote, who in reſpecte of alliaunces doe ſende helpe to theyr confederates, and vppon any other neceſſarie occaſion doe ſuccour and releeue the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: then muſt wee not conſider of anie daungers or diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modityes. For in dooing our duetyes, whether wee ſuffer, or whether wee periſhe, our labour or loſſe is alwayes well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>
               <p>Nowe will I diſcourie vppon a certayne polytike rule, vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie alleadged in ſuch lyke affayres as this. Which many verie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <note place="margin">An examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the rule of certain poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks who are of opinion that a great kingdome ſhould neuer be with out warre againſt ſome ſtranger.</note> perſons both haue and ſtill doe allowe, to ſee howe the ſame may agree with vs. This is it, <hi>A great eſtate repleniſhed with warlike people, ought ſtill to haue ſome foreine warre wherewith to keepe it occupied, leaſt beeing at quiet they conuert their weapons each againſt other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The maintayners heereof doe alleadge the example of <hi>Scipio Naſica,</hi> who counſayled it to the <hi>Romaines.</hi> Concluding that <hi>Carthage</hi> ought not to bee razed, to the end ſtill to haue an enimie whome to feare and bee alwayes buſied withall: <hi>For</hi> (ſayde he) <hi>if this feare and cauſe bee taken awaie, they be in danger to moue one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another in their owne land.</hi> Heereto they adde, <hi>that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath taught, that when we haue appeaſed our foreine warres, we haue entered into ciuill which haue almoſt beaten vs quite down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moreouer, that our Nation beeing inſolent in peace, impatient of tarrying long in the houſe, full of generoſitie, and deſirous of glorie, must of neceſſitie exerciſe it ſelfe in armes, to the ende to diſcharge ſo many conceites of the minde, without the Realme, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finallie, that <hi>the badde humours remayning of our ciuill diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (by theſe humours meaning corrupted perſons) <hi>had need to be purged, and therefore that we ſhould ſuffer them to go out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, if wee ſee them ſo diſploſed, or elſe to force them foorth by arte, least they ſhoulde breede anie new diſeaſe. And this hath beene put heeretofore in practiſe at the ende of our warres agaynst the Engliſh Nation.</hi> Trulie I dare not denie but we are to attribute much to the obſeruations of antiquitie, of things that haue had good ſucceſſe when they haue bene vſed in time conuenient. But withall, I dare aduowe that euerie time to applie the ſame to an eſtate, and not to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8683:70"/>
conſider the ſeuerall diſpoſition thereof, is to miſtake. Likewiſe the better to know how to applie this vnto vs, let vs looke in what ſtate it now ſtandeth. In truth it is ſo euill at eaſe, that the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſo vigorous a lawe, in ſteade of a remedie, were the waie to weaken it more and more. Euerie man knoweth that our troubles began aboue 24. yeres agoe, which haue beene no warres, but but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherly ſlaughters, &amp; who ſo liſt to beleue a booke printed vnder the name of <hi>Frumenteau,</hi> which layeth open the chiefe deſolations of our land, how can be but wonder at ſo terrible deſtructions? Aboue halfe the Nobilitie is periſhed: As for ſouldiours we muſt count them by legions, the people vniuerſally waſted, the treaſuries ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">The ſtrange miſiries of our ciuill Warres.</note> drie, debts increaſed, diſcipline neglected, godlineſſe periſhed, manners depraued, iuſtice corrupted, men diuided, and all thinges in ſale. Be not theſe braue preparatiues to build new purpoſes? It is as if a man in lieu of ſtones ſhould take clots of earth, and myre in ſtead of lime, and then chooſe a mariſh ground to builde a Caſtle vpon: whom we might with good reaſon wiſh to renue his wits, to conſider the defects of his ſtuffe, and to ſtaie vntill hee were better prouided. Likewiſe in that ſtate wherein we now ſtand, to enter of a iolitie into anie great warre before that foure or fiue yeres haue renued our youth, were it not as a man ſhoulde ſay, as much as to let him bloud againe that hath alreadie loſt almoſt all his bloud? And to vndertake the ſame w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out diſcipline, is as much as to builde without rule. Neither is it any leſſe inconuenience to be vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of money. For ſooner might a man make a ſhip to ſwim with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oares or ſayles, than proſecute a warre without wealth. Who then would be ſo farre ouerſeene as to counſayle vs to beginne the thing that muſt haue a bad end, which neceſſarilie will enſue of the defects aforeſayd?</p>
               <p>I am ſure that <hi>Scipio Naſica</hi> aforementioned, neuer meant to wiſh them voluntarily to begin an enterpriſe whereof they coulde reape nothing but loſſe and infamie, neither would aduowe ſuch a one to bee profitable to a lande alreadie halfe buried in miſeries: For hee feared not the <hi>Romaines</hi> aduerſitie, but theyr proſperitie, which brought with it pride and inſolencie. And this we are to note, that foure yeere after that <hi>Publius Cornelius Scipio</hi> had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and made peace with the <hi>Carthegenians,</hi> the <hi>Romaines</hi> grewe ſo haughtie, ſeeing themſelues crowned with ſo many victories and triumphes, that theyr ſkinnes coulde not holde them. Then was not diſcipline anie whit out of frame. The
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8683:71"/>
common treaſurlie was mightilie increaſed as well with the riche ſpoylos of <hi>Carthage</hi> as of <hi>Spaine,</hi> neyther had they anie want of men. This was the cauſe that moued the Senate to thinke it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to be doing with <hi>Philip of Macedon</hi> which was a verie wiſe practiſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rule aforeſaid. But what conformitie is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our preſent ſtate and the ſtate of the <hi>Romaines</hi> at that time? As much as betweene a rich, ſound, and well ordered man, and a poore, ſieke, and buruly perſon. Let vs then firſt cure our diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, before wee imitate their dooinges in theyr full force and ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Many doe thinke <hi>France</hi> to bee as well repleniſhed with men as euer it was. Wherein they deceiue themſelues. And in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion <note place="margin">Whether Fraunce be well furniſhed of men of warre.</note> the matter that deceiueth them is, that they ſee the moſt of thoſe that ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>tenaunce: For if a cobler hath beene a ſouldiour but two yeeres, hee will thinke himſelfe worthie to weare a guilte ſwoorde (which our Fathers woulde haue beene loath to permitte to anie vnder the degree of knighthoode) yea, and hee will weare it if hee can come by it eyther by hooke or crooke, as alſo his ſilke neatherſtockes, which good <hi>King Henrie the ſecond</hi> neuer ware: whereto lykewiſe his ſpeech ſhall bee correſpondent. For if this ſouldiour doe but looke awrie vppon a man, hee is by and by dead at the leaſt. This is it that blindeth ſuch as take in payment ſhews and lookes, who peraduenture applying to them the Prouerbe that, <hi>One man is worth an hundered,</hi> doe imagine that our <hi>France</hi> doe ouerflowe with men of armes and warriours. But my opinion heerein is, that yet wee haue a good number both Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and commons: Theſe beeing well kepte, and to them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning the youth which ſixe yeeres may bring forward, wee maye trulie ſaie, that it ſhall ouerflowe with ſuch men as ſhall neede no great pricking forward to make them to ſtirre. Leſſe time can we not haue to redreſſe our warfare and repleniſh our coffers, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to reſtore our vertues.</p>
               <p>But, will ſome ſaie, if anie good occaſion ſhould fall out, ſhal we let it ſlippe? That is the maiſters parte to iudge of, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture the Ladie may be ſo beautifull, that ſhee may haue a good <note place="margin">Of warres with our the realme.</note> looke. Yet will it be hard for vs to lyke of anie, vntill we haue put on agayne our auncient ornamentes. As for the purgation afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, meete to caſt foorth the dregges which the ciuill wars haue lefte behinde them, I doubt it will proue lyke to <hi>Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:8683:71"/>
which expelleth both good and badde humours together: As wee maye ſee by that which euen lately wee haue to our domage tried.</p>
               <p>Our weakneſſe longeth rather after reſtoritiues, than thoſe things that purge violentlie. For, ſo to thinke that <hi>France</hi> cannot bee pacified without ſending awaie fiue or ſixe thouſand diſordered ſouldiours, is but to winke with one eie. But let vs ſtirre them a little, and wee ſhall ſee that wee muſt goe farther, and that theſe little bells doe not ſound before the great ones haue rong out. We muſt thinke that moſt <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> yea, euen thoſe that follow ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures are wearie of ſuffering ſo many miſchiefes, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi> were of the ſlaughters of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Silla:</hi> lykewiſe that they miſlike not of reſt, becauſe they knowe it to bee neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for them, which after they ſhall for a while haue inioyed, they wil afterwarde be but ouer-readie to imploie themſelues where a man liſt.

a little fame through that only, then a great deale by diuers ioyned together. I thinke it no abuſe to eſteeme of the thing that ſo deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, no more then to like of ſome pearle that a man hath bought: but if any mans affection thereto ſhould be ſo addicted, as therefore to diſdaine all other precious ſtones, were it not a token of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe iudgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The like is it with vertues, whereof the leaſt is ſo neceſſarie, that we may ſay that the want thereof breedeth great diſcommodities. If a man might ſerue his turne with one of them as well as with one garment, his life would not peraduenture bée ſo troubleſome. But it ſhould likewiſe leeſe a great parte of the beautie and commoditie in being deſpoyled of all the fayreſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For as the more a garden or medowe are planted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritched with diuers kindes of fruite and flowers, the better they are eſteemed, euen ſo ſhould he be that hath moſt vertues: without the which his life is but obſcure. Neuertheleſſe, it is good that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſhould conſider his owne vocation, to the end to apply ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto that which may be moſt conuenient for himſelf, the vſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhould alſo bee to him moſt familier. As to the politique man, diſcretion: to the Deuine, humilitie: to the Lawyer, iuſtice: and to the Souldier, courage. But as for the Nobleman, whereto ſhall we tye him?

               <p>I am not of opinion that Gentlemen ſhould ſtay vpon one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">That Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould be adorned with ſundry vertues.</note> vertue, but alſo grow in loue with many.

I knowe that <hi>Fortitude</hi> (by ſome named Proweſſe or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> doe not moderate her ſhe will turne into <hi>rage,</hi> and not guided by <hi>diſcretion</hi> will labour out of ſeaſon. Wherein wee ſee there is a league betwéene them, and each affordeth mutuall ayde to other, which cannot be altered without perticuler preiudice to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of them. The Martiners doe not thinke one Anchor ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſtay and hold a Shippe tite. The like may we ſay of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:8683:73"/>
who muſt haue more then one vertue to confirme their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: which is not vnknowne to thoſe that are learned in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſcipline, of whome the number is very ſmall, by reaſon that the error whereof wee now entreate hath made the greater multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude too partiall: as appeareth in the titles that many take vpon them, as calling themſelves <hi>The arme of the country, the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyner of armes, and the terror to the enemies:</hi> which titles I blame not, notwithſtanding in my opinion the name <hi>Profeſſor of Vertue,</hi> would comprehend much more and yéeld them greater honor.</p>
               <p>It is moſt certaine that for the well handling of the weapon it <note place="margin">The error of ſuch as ſuppoſe proweſſe only to be ſufficient to the proſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of armes.</note> were requiſite to be endued with much boldneſſe &amp; generoſitie: as alſo to ſuch as haue bene furniſhed therwith haue redounded much commendation, which hath cauſed many ſo to admire this profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: which neuertheleſſe through ouer much praiſe haue bred this error, namely, <hi>to make ſmall accompt of all other vertues.</hi> For it is not vnknowne that in our grandfathers daies, if a gentleman had giuen himſelfe to ſtudie the Greeke tongue or Latine, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions would ſay that he muſt be made a clarke, alſo that a ſword beſeemed him not. Wherof grew this prouerbe, that <hi>it was enough for a Souldier to be able to write his owne name,</hi> as if knowledge had bene a hinderance to his valour. I thinke they were of opinion that he that ſhewed himſelfe audacious, expert in his weapon, and prone to quarrelling, was ſufficiently armed for the attayning to ritches and honor: and ordinarily they that were noted to bee ſuch, obteyned both. I will not vtterly reiect theſe things, which beare I wot not what fayre ſhewe: yet will I ſay thus much, that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accompanied (as is aforeſayd) with other good qualities, they be not ſo commendable as men think for. Howbeit, although ſome one chaunce not to abuſe this vertue of <hi>Valiancie,</hi> yet ought he not to burie himſelfe therein, conſidering that the vſe of the reſt is more neceſſarie for him. If he fighteth once in a moneth, it is all, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, if he liſt he may daily put in practiſe other good gifts to the benefite of others and his owne commendation. It is no ſmall matter to be accompted a Souldier, but when honeſtie is thereto adioyned it is much more. And thus are we to make our perticuler profeſſion to leane to the generall vocation, that is, to liue well, whereunto all men are bound. And whoſoeuer forgetteth this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall rule to ſtay himſelfe onely vpon the obſeruations there vpon depending, it ſhould ſeeme that he is rather led by profit or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  <hi>Hanniball</hi> of <hi>Carthage</hi> was one of the moſt famous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines <note place="margin">Proweſſe deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of other vertues deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth of the name of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</note> that euer were, yet being deſtitute of pietie and faith, and withall a cruell and deceiptfull perſon, it bred him the name to bée a moſt wicked man. How much greater commendation deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> who was both an honeſt man and as good a Captaine withall: This neuer boaſted ſo much in his valiancie, as to deſpiſe the thing that made him not onely a true Citizen but alſo a good houſeholder. For, to bee iuſt to his friends and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his enemies, are no ſuch contraries, but that they may very well concurre together, becauſe the originall of them both procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from one ſpring.</p>
               <p>Well, I will confeſſe that in a man of warre proweſſe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, but in the well borne Gentleman, his ſtudie, exerciſe and pleaſure ſhould ſhoote at all the vertues, eſpecially at thoſe that are moſt to bee preferred, conſidering that Nobilitie is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation in all thoſe good thinges. I thinke no man will gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay but <hi>Pietie, Truth, Temperance and Iuſtice</hi> muſt march be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Fortitude,</hi> notwithſtanding ſhe alſo helpeth the reſt. For the vngodly, lying, diſſolute or vniuſt perſon, whatſoeuer goodly cloke of proweſſe that may bee giuen him, is neuertheleſſe eſchued and hated, as being much more hurtfull to his friendes then dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to his enemies, although he knowe neuer ſo well how to helpe himſelfe with his weapon. For this cauſe ought Noblemen firſt to learne thoſe thinges that are moſt neceſſarie, and ſo by degrees to diſcend to thoſe that may better be forborne: ſo ſhall they eſcape this error which ſtayeth them vppon one ſimple prize, and hideth from them many other more precious, wherein they haue no leſſe intereſt.</p>
               <p>It might peraduenture beſeeme a poore Souldier, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">It becommeth a Gentleman to profeſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers vertues.</note> nothing, hath by his weapon and deſert hath atchieued meanes to liue, neuer to depart the bounds of proweſſe, but high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to extoll it, as euery artificer will doe his arte. But the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to whome as well this as many other waies are yet open, wherein to exerciſe himſelfe and to atteyne to honor, yeeldeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as it were priſoner, yea euen guiltie, in ſeeking to march only vnder the one, ſith he is bound to walke in all.</p>
               <p>I remember an aunſwere to this purpoſe once made at the Court to one whoſe continuall talke was of warre, yea euen in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:8683:74"/>
the tyme of peace. <hi>When the warres begin againe,</hi> ſaid one to him, <hi>you ſhall be ſet on worke, but now ſeeing you are destitute of ciuill and peaceable conditions, I would wiſh you to ſhut vp your ſelfe in a cheſt, ſo to keepe you from ruſt vntil tyme ſerue: either els to temporiſe at this time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former error is ſomewhat tollerable, becauſe it may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: <note place="margin">Againſt ſuch as abuſe their force and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leancie.</note> and it is to bee hoped that he which will endeuour to doe one parte of his duetie, being better taught will employe himſelfe in the reſt: but he that abuſeth that one onely vertue that he hath choſen is wonderfully out of the way. And whereas Gentlemen do weare their ſwords girt to their ſides, firſt they do it in the defence of their Countrie, and next to employ them vnder the authoritie of the lawes to defend the weake and innocent from the vyolence of the oppreſſors: alſo to preſerue their owne perſons from outrage: So farre is the practiſe now from following the ſayd rules, that contrariwiſe many as well noble as vnnoble doe vſe them to doe more harme to their friends then hurt to their enemies. This is a goodly valiancie that ſerueth onely to deſtroye it ſelfe: and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous are the Tryumphes which are erected of the ſpoyles of Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, alſo of the weapons and blood of neighbours and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>Some man will ſay, that <hi>Fortitude</hi> is an other maner of thing <note place="margin">Wherein va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leancie conſis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</note> and ſhineth principally in the warres: I graunt it, but not in theſe which ſeeme it to be vnperfect in all places. <hi>Valiancie</hi> among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things conſiſteth in vanquiſhing rather then to flee, and in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining of labour freely.

And as for the ſecond, there néede but two daies rayne and fower and twentie howers want, to raiſe a w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

And if the <hi>French</hi> Princes, Lords, famous Capteynes, and Gentlemen which doe well vſe the ſame doe not endeuour to reſtore it into the former dignitie and to take away the abuſes, they ſhall many tymes finde themſelues as well at the Court as in the field farre abuſed. And our nation which heretofore hath through true <hi>Valiancie</hi> gotten ſuch fame, ſhall behold it ſelfe ſlaue to thoſe that heretofore haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed it. This may ſuffice to ſhewe that Nobilitie ought to ayme at all vertues, and not at one alone: Likewiſe that they muſt not peruert that vertue which ought to be the piller of their armes.</p>

               <p>The ſecond falſe opinion is not ſo hurtfull as the firſt, howbeit <note place="margin">Examination of the ſecond opinion.</note> it moleſteth many and to no purpoſe, in cauſing them to ſeeke feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities rather apparant then true, and to iudge amiſſe of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many. I miſlike not that men ſhould commend that kinde of life that any hath choſen: becauſe it liketh the chooſer: but raſhly to condemne other mens, argueth a little pride and want of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.

Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſuch as are poore and haue quicke wittes being capeable to ſerue either publiquely or priuatly, may ſeeke their aduentures through al places, and thoſe likewiſe that haue met with them and are bound vnto them by any bond of ſeruice, of office, or of arte to goe neere or farre, ought not to faile in perfourming theſe dueties.

It giueth, ſay they, ſmall content, and extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the force of courage. They doe likewiſe perſwade themſelues that thoſe which are nothing mooued in the preſence of great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, neither ſtirred vp by emulation of their equals, muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie ſtoope to ſuch actions as may be termed ſeruiſe. Alſo the moſt of theſe hauing bene brought vp in theſe ſtately Courts, doe thinke that the excellencie and beautie of vertue doe neuer ſhine but where it is beſt floriſhed out and with greateſt traynes: ſo that perceiuing it o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y doe at their friends when they be fallen into extreme pouertie. And therefore marking thoſe that neuer ſtirre from home, but lye ſtill as it were hidden and without any ſhewe, they would thereby inferre that they want good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as thinking that if they had any, the ſame would force them foorth as the ſailes doe force, the Shippe into the maine Sea:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8683:75"/>
But in their wordes they make many falſe conſequences. For to ſay that that vertue ſeemeth obſcure which beareth but her owne ſimple ſhewe; likewiſe that he that hath enough; if he proclaymeth not abroade, <hi>I haue vertue to ſell,</hi> ſeemeth to haue but little: Alſo that contentment dependeth vpon the knowledge, and fauour of the mightie and the multitude, is to be blinded with the apparance of outward things, which bleare the ſight of thoſe that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The Philoſophers doe holde that true felicite conſiſteth in the participation of vertue, likewiſe that the ſame may be found in all ſortes of men and in all places. Which is ſo true that none can denye it. Wee muſt therefore before we contemne any kinde of life, how baſe ſoeuer it ſeemeth, looke whether no portion of vertue ſhineth therein. For if there doe, wee ought not to condemne it at randon.</p>
               <p>Well, the better to iudge thereof, let vs more neerely examine <note place="margin">Commodities of countrie life.</note> this maner of countrie life, and wee ſhall peraduenture ſee that it bringeth foorth very good and fayre fruites both for it ſelfe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Firſt, he that hath choſen it may in theſe ſome what ſolitarie places more deuoutly exerciſe-the dueties of Religion, and with leſſe hinderances thoſe of charitie then among the great ſocieties, where Princes or vanities doe for the moſt part detaine the minds in thraldome, and withdrawe them from ſuch meditatious as are neceſſarie for all: and when Godlineſſe, which is the foundation of life, is well vnderſtood and perfectly practiſed, there enſueth great contentation. Next, the minde findeth greater tranquilitie in ſuch places then in Courts and Cities, where it is torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with moſt vyolent verturbations: as ambition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> raging loue, reuenge, wrath, papine and enuie. For in the countrie life thoſe obiects that ſtirre vp inward rage doth not commonly haunt.

two ſorts. For firſt ſuperfluitie, the only ſepulcher wherein many rich houſes are buryed, is in maner vnknowne in the countrie life. Secondly, houſehold orders are well obſerued, and although the vſe of thrift bee the ordinarie rule, yet doth liberalitie ſhine in the middeſt thereof, and honeſt ſufficiencie who is ſtill neighbour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance neuer departeth: the contrary wherof appeareth where prodigalitie rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

For her followers doe often tymes trye the ſame that Shippes doe in a ſtorme, whome the waues doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme lift vp to the Clowdes, and by and by bring downe to the bottome of the Sea. Euen ſo they hauing made ſtately cheare for the ſpace of ſome eight daies, muſt remaine halfe a yeere pinched with al kinde of penury. As for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie that the others reape by the preſence and frequentation of that whereof of I ſpeake, it is likewiſe to bee conſidered. For to begin with his famelie, there is no doubt but, according to the prouerbe, <hi>Such maiſter ſuch man,</hi> if he be endued with many vertues, he ſhareth them with his, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with his wife and children, deſcribing in his priuate famelie the forme of a well ordered Commonwelth.

Finally, ſuch a mans neighbours and kindred may among their greateſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities note this, that they may be ordinarily conuerſant with him, and ſo to taſte of ſundrie goodly fruites of learning and amitie. Who ſo liſt farther to learne the commendations of the countrie life, let him reade thoſe bookes that are purpoſely written thereof. For my parte it is enough that I haue in a word touched it by the way, as well not to bring out of liking thoſe that vſe it well, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſhew to others that diſdaine it, that it is not deſtitute of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, honeſtie, and ſolace.</p>
               <p>Now let vs ſee whether it deminiſheth proweſſe as ſome doe <note place="margin">Whether the country life quaileth proweſe.</note> ſuppoſe. For my parte I thinke not in any in whom the loue of vertue is not quite extinct. For in whatſoeuer place they bee, they ſtill thinke it conuenient for a Gentleman to beare a mans ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke. On the other ſide, the exerciſe of the Horſe, the running at the Ring, hunting and the haquebut are portraitures and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of warre which waken the courages and maintaine them in force. But communication with our like doth alſo greatly helpe thereto: becauſe the ſpeeches both of the one and other doe tend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to contemne towardlike demeanours and to exalt the valiant: ſo
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:8683:76"/>
as hereof wee make a counterpoize againſt that delicacie which by little and little is engendred in thoſe perſons whoſe liues are free from daunger. I knowe well enough that the Nobilitie that houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth reſidence a great parte of the yeere in frontier Garriſons, is (through continuall exerciſe in warlike diſcourſes) more ſtirred vp to the loue of proweſſe, then that that kéepe home. But all cannot be there maintained, neither doe thoſe that are depriued of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, conſidering the reputation of the reſt, but make inwardly ſome ſmall prouiſion of that which is the cauſe of obtaining the ſame. Moreouer, it followeth not that becauſe they are not ſo ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in militarie profeſſion as others, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are therefore voyde of courage: For he that hath good ſeede in him, with a little cuſtome maketh it well to fructifie. How many braue Capteynes haue in our fathers daies bene ſeene neuer to ſtirre from home after the warres were once ended? And yet when occaſion ſerued that they muſt to it againe they were nothing inferiour to any of the reſt. Thus much muſt I needes ſay that like as martiall exerciſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not all that practiſe it valiant, no more doth dwelling at home ſo daunt the courages of thoſe that vſe it, but that they can alwaies be well enough diſpoſed to doe their parts when honor commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. As for the reſt who euen burye themſelues by perpetuall kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping home in their owne houſes, to the ende onely to ſtoope to effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate pleaſures and ſloth, either els to haue the better opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to practiſe violence or couetouſneſſe. I will ſay no more, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh that among the Nobilitie there were Cenſors eſtabliſhed as in the <hi>Romaine</hi> Commonwelth: that through publique ſhame their faultes whether ſecrete or open might be corrected. For it is a ſhame for the goodly title of Nobilitie to be made a cloake to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie actions. Now were it not amiſſe to examine whether the felicitie of thoſe that goe vp &amp; downe to ſeeke it thus euery where, and who weene to haue more then others, be ſo great as they ſay for: But I will not ſtay therevpon to the ende to diſcourſe vpon the third falſe opinion.</p>
               <p>Many there are that reproue it, others alſo that put it in practiſe, <note place="margin">The cenſure of the thirde opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> either thinking it not to want a good foundation, or els becauſe that by the vſe thereof they reape profite and preferment. But how ſoeuer they liſt to take it, they are not to be excuſed. For our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions muſt agree with that that is iuſt, and our commodities bee purchaſed without iniuſtice: which euen thoſe ought to knowe that make accompt to excéede the common people in dignitie and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:8683:77"/>
to the ende they by their example may conforme themſelues to fulfill whatſoeuer the duetie of all. And as it is an eaſie matter from liberalitie, which teacheth vs the maner to giue in place and ſeaſon conuenient, to fall into prodigalitie which ſheweth how to doe the contrary: ſo without diligent heede from true obedience we ſlide into falſe, which in counterexchaunge of a matter due, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs to doe that that is not due.</p>
               <p>This queſtion haue ſundrie learned perſonages at large treated vpon, of whoſe iudgements wee ought not to bee ignorant; to the ende alwaies in our ſelues to bee reſolued of a matter of ſo great waight. I will therefore (following their ſteppes) ſpeake only two or three words according to my capacitie, eſpecially vſing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions taken out of <hi>Gods</hi> worde. The ſame teacheth vs that <hi>God</hi> hath ſet vp the mightie that haue dominion ouer the nations, to rule and gouerne them in pietie and iuſtice: whom likewiſe he commaundeth vs to haue in ſinguler honor and to obey, whervpon <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſaith: <hi>Let euery ſoule be ſubiect to the ſuperiour powers, for there is no power but of God, and the powers that are, are the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Romans. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>of God.</hi> This only place might ſuffice to enſtruct as well the one as the other in their dueties. For herein are the ſuperiours warned to remember the ſacred dignitie wherewith they are ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that they neither abuſe nor prophane it by crueltie, couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or voluptuous luſt. Likewiſe the inferiours to bowe their neckes vnder thoſe authorities as vnder the yoke of <hi>God,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in patience, but in ioye alſo. For as <hi>S. Paule</hi> in the ſame chapter ſayth. <hi>They that reſiſt the powers, doe reſiſt the ordinance of GOD.</hi> Whereto he afterward addeth, <hi>That the Prince beareth the ſword for the benefite of his ſubiects whether for their defence or correction.</hi> Which reaſon ought to make vs thinke obedience ſweete, becauſe in yeelding the ſame wee both pleaſe <hi>God</hi> and reape profite. If Princes would well conſider the goodly titles and large preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues that <hi>God</hi> giueth them, they would amende and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements ſhould be more iuſt. For by the mouth of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid</hi> he ſaith: <hi>I haue ſayd, ye are Gods, and children to the moſt higheſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> herein ſignifying that as in them ſhineth the image of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe Empyre is both in heauen and earth, ſo ought they to imitate him in well doing rather then in hurting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying: but becauſe the moſt part of them do neglect or contemne theſe moſt worthie inſtructions, they growe to degenerate, in ſuch wiſe that euermore that eſtate hath bene moſt happie, wherein the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:8683:77"/>
moſt of thoſe that haue ſit vpon the throne haue beue vertuaus. The places likewiſe by me alleadged ought to retaine the people from ſtirring not onely in vniuſt cauſes, but alſo in ſuch as are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſary, when they contemne thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>God</hi> hath ſo exalted. Alſo when a good and mercifull Prince raigneth, if his Subiects doe through diſobedience prouoke him, they make themſelues guiltie before <hi>God</hi> and man, and thus much I thinke fewe can gainſay.</p>
               <p>But the queſtion is, <hi>of one that maketh ſmall accompt of the lawes or iustice ſhould commaund that thing that were wicked, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

                  <hi>wee ought to obeye him.</hi> Hereto I aunſwer that if this iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie conſiſteth in rayſing of taxes and tributes vpon the ſubiects goods, (which many haue often tryed) either in the encreaſe of the labours layd vpon their perſons, (as <hi>Pharao</hi> delt with the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes)</hi> in ſuch a caſe wee can doe no better then to humble our ſelues before <hi>God,</hi> and cratte of him pardon and deliuerance from ſo vyolent oppreſſion. For notwithſtanding it proccede of his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie and mallice that is author therof, yet are we withall to marke <hi>Gods</hi> ordinance, who vſeth ſuch ſcourges to tame the imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe whom he will amend. <hi>Why?</hi> will ſome man ſay, <hi>what honor can he deſerue, who from a iuſt principalitie is fallen into tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie? who in liewe of ſhearing his ſheepe doth flea and deuour them? Sith alſo he ſo villanouſly peruerteth publique order, is he not vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie that any ſhould yeeld him reuerence? God</hi> in his worde ſayth, that notwithſtanding he greatly diſlike this oppreſſion, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth of mans frailtie and luſtes, kindled by the deuils mallice, yet doth it not aboliſh the ſubiection due to ſuperiorities and polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, wherein we muſt ſtill marke the footpathes of his decree. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe were the ſaying of <hi>S. Paule</hi> in vayne, that <hi>the powers that are, are the ordinances of God.</hi> Neither ſhould <hi>S. Peter</hi> haue any reaſon to commaund vs to <hi>honor the King.</hi> But if any ſay that this had relation to the good, I muſt anſwer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant what men <hi>Tyberius</hi> &amp; <hi>Caligula</hi> were, either <hi>Nero,</hi> all which we might rather name horrible Tyrants then true Princes. If therfore among theſe horrible politique confuſions they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded vs to looke higher &amp; to humble our ſelues, this precept ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh alpeople that ſuffer violence through the pride or couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their ſuperiours, to thinke once or twiſe before they kicke againſt the prick. For vndoubtedly <hi>God</hi> ordeyned the bad Princes as well as the good, according to the ſaying of the Prophet <hi>Oſeas:</hi>

Thirdly, to ſeeke lawfull remedies againſt the miſchiefe, which if they faile vs, then to waite in patience. And hauing well diſcharged our ſelues in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aforeſayd, then to haue good hope of wiſhed ſucceſſe. If wee are in any affayre to obſerue moderation and wiſedome, then in this eſpecially. The precepts of <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> and auncient cuſtomes of the <hi>Romaines</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> (the moſt ciuill and wiſeſt nations among all other) did graunt more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to the oppreſſed then <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> doth. For they did ſo hate and abhorre tyrannie that they could in no wiſe away with it. Which notwithſtanding it be euen to this day moſt odious, yet muſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> haue more patience then others, becauſe that he which ſo ſtrictly commaundeth it, doth withall promiſe in tyme conuenient to prouide for their miſeries: whereby wee may ſee of what force and power the doctrine of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> is, to print in mens mindes the lawe of obedience and reuerence toward the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours.</p>
               <p>This if ſome Princes were perfect in, they would not perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture ſo readily followe the counſailes of diuers <hi>Churchmen,</hi>

It is the olde ſong which is now out of vſe, ſince the Scriptures bewrayed your pot of Roſes, that is to ſay, your abuſes, at the moſt whereof euen ſome of your owne men doe make a ieſt and giue them no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite.

and bodily paynes vpon falſe accuſations: and yet will you not that they ſhould ſeeke any remedies to exempt them from ſuch intollerable and cruell miſeries.</p>
               <p>But now I thinke of it, I haue degreſſed from my purpoſe, to <note place="margin">Of duety.</note> ſpeake of the furies vſed againſt the conſciences. But I will ſay no more, but returne to my firſt path, againe to confirme my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſaying, that bodily charges though heauie, ſhould bee borne. For as <hi>Samuell</hi> ſayth: <hi>Kings ſhall ſometymes be very readie to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe</hi>

                  <hi>their people, and although they crye out,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>yet will not God heare them.</hi> And this ought to admoniſh them to ſuffer ſo long as it ſhall pleaſe <hi>God</hi> to withdrawe his fauorable hand from them. All that I haue hetherto alleadged to exalt the mightie and their dignitie, tendeth not ſo to puffe them vp that through diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red licence they ſhall exceede the boundes of iuſtice. For if they would, yet can <hi>God</hi> chaſtize them as he did <hi>Roboam and Saule,</hi> and prouide lawfull remedies to deliuer thoſe that are oppreſſed. Neither doe I beléeue that there is any ſtate but hath lawes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe oppreſſors when their vyolences are ouer grieuous or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall.</p>
               <p>Now, in theſe corrupt Kingdomes many men there are that <note place="margin">Of ſuch as doe whatſoeuer they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded.</note> neede no great compulſion to worke wickedneſſe, as thinking that their obedience due to Princes couereth all that is amiſſe in their actions. Yea ſome that haue publique offices doe take themſelues to be double bound not to refuſe to do any thing that may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them, in that they are not only ſubiects but alſo officers. Theſe preſuppoſitions are the occaſion that a miſchiefe conceiued by a fewe and embraced by many hath a more long and larger courſe. They hold that if the great doe commaund, they muſt yéeld and obey: for notwithſtanding the matter were vniuſt, yet is the executer thereof excuſable and the commaunder aunſwerable. But theſe obſequious mates are much deceiued in couering themſelues with a ſacke betymes, and leauing all the blame to their maiſters. Others there are likewiſe in this miſerable world, wherein wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe playeth her laſt prize, that runne yet faſter, proclayming that whatſoeuer the Princes will, is lawfull for him. Theſe ſecond are vnworthie to haunt among the good, either to bee their dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall ſeruants, for that with their extreeme flatterie they corrupt their ſoules. More meete were they to haue ſuch maiſters as <hi>Pope Alexander the ſixt, and Caeſar Borgia,</hi> his Baſterd, who in all crueltie, diſſolution, and infidelitie were equall with the auncient
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8683:79"/>
                  <hi>Sicilian</hi> tyrants, that they might entreate them as they did ſome of their catchpolles: of whome when one vnder colour of Iuſtice and at their commaundement had executed all kinde of crueltie in <hi>Romagnia,</hi> they cut off his head. And whoſoeuer had ſtollen too much, or met with any fayre dame vnder the defence of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, was many tymes forced to giue them a ſhare: wherein they had but their due: for hauing either inſtructed or confirmed their maiſters in this falſe principle of ſuperfiuous power, rather then abſolute, it is but meete themſelues ſhould taſte of the fruite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as <hi>Phalaris</hi> delt with <hi>Perillus</hi> who had inuented the braſen bull to pleaſe him withall. If men would well conſider that it is the part of good Kings to doe and commaund things that be iuſt: they would thereby learne that the dueties likewiſe of good ſubiects or ſeruants is to frame their obedience by this true rule. For the will of <hi>God,</hi> who preſcribeth lawes to all, tendeth to make vs doe; well and eſchue euill. How then can ſome excuſe themſelues for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting vnlawfull deedes, vnder the pretence of commaundement, ſith God forbiddeth it? The thrones are polluted and the miniſter of Iuſtice is couered with reproach.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe that none, except the ſlaue of ſome Tyrant, dare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowe <note place="margin">A more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſcours.</note> that if a Prince ſhould commaund ſome one of his ſubiects to ſlay his father, to habandon his wife to the Stewes, or to blaſpheme <hi>God,</hi> but he ought therein to denye him obedience, and the reaſon is, that the lawes both of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> whereto all men are ſubiect, doe prohibite ſuch things. It followeth therefore that the inferiour is not alwaies bound to fulfill whatſoeuer his ſuperiour commaundeth.</p>
               <p>But as theſe with other ſuch like vniuſtices ſo apparantly wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are but ſieldome commaunded, vnleſſe by ſome barbarous hart and minde, as alſo that fewe there are but will abhorre to commit them, ſo doe the wilier ſorte couer their miſchiefes with a faire vaile, euen as men couer poyſon with gold, to the ende men ſhould not ſpare to proceede farther: and therein it is that thoſe that will not contaminate their honeſties, ought to open their eyes, leaſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of good faith they bee deceiued. Others there are who through ſome vehement paſſion doe commaund vyolent things, neither doe either the one or the other want fit men to put them in execution. And to this purpoſe I will alleadge two examples: the one of a wicked Emperour, &amp; the other of a good, both <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The firſt was the Emperour <hi>Phocas,</hi> who ordeyned that the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8683:79"/>
of Rome</hi> ſhould be called the head of the <hi>vniuerſall Church,</hi> where before he was but a <hi>Metropolitaine.</hi> This wicked mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer through his ambition cauſed the Emperour <hi>Maurice</hi> whoſe officer he was, together with his wife and children to bee ſlaine, to the ende to obteyne his place, neither could that ſacred dignitie ſtay his hands. Herein was agreement betweene the maiſter and the ſeruants, who were the one as good as the other, neither did any of them ſay that the deede was vnlawfull, but they did all yéeld voluntarie obedience. <hi>Dauid</hi> would not doe ſo: for although <hi>Saule</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 24.</note> purſued him to haue ſlayne him, yet when himſelfe fell into his handes, he ſayd: <hi>I will not ſtretch foorth my hands againſt my Lord, for he is the Lords anoynted.</hi> Who then could commaund <hi>Dauid</hi> to ſlay his innocent friend, ſith he would in no caſe offend his guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie enemie?</p>
               <p>The ſecond example is of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who in a franticke furie commaunded that the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> that had committed ſundrie ryots ſhould all be hewen in peeces, and to that ende ſent a whole legion of Souldiers who ſlewe ſeuen thouſand, that is to ſay, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more innocents then guiltie perſons. Whereof the good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was afterward moſt ſorowfull and ſolemnely confeſſed his offence.

We haue an old <hi>French</hi> prouerbe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſaith: <hi>In a hundred yeres a banner, &amp; in a hundred yeres a carter:</hi> which was inuented to ſignifie that euery thing hath his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing &amp; falling. Euen ſe it happened to our muſters: for hauing ben a long time in great credite and force, afterwarde when the men of arms were inſtituted, maintained, &amp; ordinarilie vſed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> others were quite reiected, reſeruing vnto them only their auncient name with a verie weake effect. Howbeit I will not blame the inſtitution of the men of armes, which haue brought forth ſo good effects, &amp; ſtill may bring forth more, nay rather I wil alow it: but likewiſe I wiſh to ſee a good order among all that deale w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> armes. The difference between the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſiſteth not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> men, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame nobilitie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in time paſt ſerued after one manner, doth now ſerue after another. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie reſteth in the warfare which is changed.</p>
               <p>The better to vnderſtand theſe changes, &amp; to know the dueties of <note place="margin">Their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</note> ſeruice, we muſt take things farther of, &amp; climbe eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Thoſe that haue written of the affaires of <hi>France,</hi> eſpeciallie the L. of <hi>Haillan</hi> do aduow that our fees were inſtituted vnder the firſt line of our kings. By which fees he meaneth a certain quantity of land which they gaue (to ſome more to ſome leſſe) to ſuch gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men &amp; famous warriors as had ſerued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the wars, to holde the ſame vpon their faith &amp; homage, &amp; to come &amp; ſerue them a certaine time of the yere at their own charge. To the end alſo that theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; innobled perſons ſhould be the better able to maintaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they licenſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to let and demiſe their lands to the peſants for rent and yerely penſion. Moreouer they granted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both high, meane, and lawe iuſtice ouer their men and vaſſalles, the appeales whereof were reſerued to their ſoueraigne iuriſdiction.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:8683:82"/>
Thus had the high Iuſticer his lawe and inferiour Iuſtices vnd er him, whom he tearmed his men of warre, for they were bounde to wait vpon him as vpon the Lord of their fee, and the others he tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med peaſants. Theſe landes thus giuen vpon condition aforeſayd, ſuch a fee was to ſet out one man of armes, ſuch a one an archer, ſuch a one a third, and ſuch a one a fourth, who were bound to meet at a place appointed, ſo oft as by the dukes or earles (who were but ſimplie gouernors of the prouinces &amp; townes) or their bailiefes or ſtewards y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſucceeded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they ſhould be commanded. Theſe aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies were called <hi>Ban</hi> or <hi>Heriban,</hi> which after ſome ſignifieth crie or <hi>outcrie.</hi> This order ſeemeth to haue bene confirmed in the time of <hi>Charlemayn,</hi> vnder whoſe poſteritie the fees &amp; Lordſhips, which <note place="margin">Theyr order.</note> vnder our former kings were but benefits giuen for tearme of life, were through fauour continued from the Father to the ſonne, and ſo grew to be patrimoniall and hereditarie. Heereby it appeareth, what goodly priuiledges haue bene graunted to the nobilitie, but withall we are to conſider that the bonds are verie ſtrict. For they muſt alwayes come armed in defence of the Realme, and be readie to repulſe the aſſaultes and violences of ſtraungers abroad. Theſe were the auncient ſtrength of <hi>France,</hi> where with our kings for the ſpace of ſeuen hundred yeeres did many notable deedes vntill the yere 1454. wherein the men of armes were inſtituted.</p>
               <p>But who ſo is deſirous more perticularly to ſee theyr auncient <note place="margin">The difference of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers whereof they were com poſed.</note> order, let them read <hi>Froſſart,</hi> who deſcribeth the difference between the <hi>Barons, Bannerets, and high Iuſticers,</hi> as alſo of thoſe that might beare banners (which were ſquare Enſignes) and of thoſe that might carrie but penons. Likewiſe the armes of knights and manner of fight as well ioyntly as ſeuered, with the rewards and martiall puniſhments: neither doe I doubt but hauing ſeene all this, he will iudge our aunceſtors to haue beene braue fellowes.</p>
               <p>The Lord of <hi>Haillan</hi> like wiſe in his diſcourſes of <hi>France,</hi> dooth ſhew how fees came to be alienated, which were not amiſſe to bee <note place="margin">Of the aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fees.</note> knowen. The firſt cauſe proceeded of our parents deuotion. For they being by the Cleargie dayly perſwaded, that they that gaue moſt to the beautifying and enriching of the Church, had the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt places in paradiſe: ſuch of them as were able founded Abbies, Priories, and Chappels, al wel prouided for, of good rents, therby thinking ſufficiently to diſcharge themſelues. Then followed the imaginations of Purgatorie, where they were tolde that for a mortall ſinne they muſt burne ſeuen yeres in a moſt violent fire:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:8683:82"/>
howbeit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might be deliuered therefro through abundance of meſſes and praiers. Wherevpon he that had but one hundred ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of rent, gaue twentie for ſinging and praying as well for his owne ſoule as for his kinſfolkes and parents deceaſed. Thus came aboue the ſixt part of the fees of <hi>France</hi> into the hands of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie. The ſecond cauſe was, the vioages vndertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the conqueſt of the holy land, whereat whoſoeuer bare anie valiant minde would not faile to be, the rather for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our kings the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues went in perſon. And becauſe that ſome laſted three or foure yeres, the nobles ſolde part of their fees, ſo to get money to maintaine themſelues withal. Beſides all this, they alſo made their wills, wherein they bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed (in caſe they died) a good portion thereof to be praied for: ſo as many dying in thoſe dangerous and long iourneies, a greate num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the fees were ſtill alienated to the Church. The third cauſe hath growen of the continual warres with the <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> where through many Gentlemen haue bene forced to ſell their fees to the vnnoble, who had permiſſion of the kings to buy the ſame, for with out ſuch licenſe they could not before haue anie proprietie therein. All which alienations ſet together, haue pulled the third part of fées out of the bodie of the nobilitie, whereby they are fallen as it were into dead hands, that is, into their hands who cannot in perſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the auncient duties belonging to the ſame. Likewiſe ſince that time the Lawiers, Receiuers, &amp; ſome Merchants haue ſo wel huſbanded for themſelues, that they alſo haue laide holde vppon a good part of the ſayd fees, ſo as we may truly ſaie that the nobilitie doe not now poſſeſſe aboue the one halfe. Which notwithſtanding our kings in the meane time haue ſtill had the vſe of their <hi>Arrier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans:</hi> wherin were but few Gentlemen, who all almoſt ranne into place where paye, honours, and martiall rewards were ſhared out, ſo as there remaine none but men of ſmal experience: neither were they imploied but in the defence of thoſe prouinces that lay fartheſt out of the danger of warre.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, many of all ſorts of people both great and ſmal haue purchaſed exemptions fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the charges wherto their fées are bound, which haue bred as great weakning both in men and money. Our kings <hi>Frances</hi> the firſt and <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſecond, ſeeing all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, which they ſought to redreſſe, made notable decrees for the reducing of the ſaid <hi>Arrierbans</hi> into ſome order: which for lacke of well obſeruing haue not much profited. Thus much in briefe of the ſucceſſion of theſe matters.</p>

Some man may now tell me y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I labour in vaine in giuing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile <note place="margin">Whether it be vnpoſſible to redreſſe the Arrierbans.</note> to redreſſe that thing which the experience of many yeres haue taught to be ſo weake and feeble, that it is vnpoſſible to raiſe it vp againe.

Now is there great difference betweene the troups, when they appeare at the muſters in the chiefe towne, &amp; when they march whether they be commanded. For at the muſters we many times ſee Gentlemen well prouided, who appeare onely to ſaue their fées from ſeazure, &amp; as it were to ſay that they are ready to do their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſaid troups are appointed to go forth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal we ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the one halfe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are but great lubberlike boies, with a foot of beard, who wil daily deuour halfe a matto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; do march for their maſters. Then ſay you whether the king be not wel ſerued: So in a companie that ſhould contain at the leaſt 60. horſe of ſeruice, ye ſhal ſcarce finde ten that may paſſe. How is it then poſſible that they ſhould worke any good effect, conſidering the diuerſitie of men ſo meanly armed. For we ſhal find y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpeares, piſtols, &amp; harquebuts on horſebacke very ſimple ones, &amp; others, armed only with breſtplates: likewiſe croſbowes on foot, harquebuts, &amp; others, armed only with a ſhirt of maile &amp; a ruſtie iaueline, wherof ſome wil ſay they be men of armes, others archers, but in deed few of them good ſouldiours. There is not ſo expert a Captaine but would find himſelfe ſhreud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled to ſet the whole generation of them in araie to fight: ſo as euen they that command ouer them may wel iudge that it is hard

to get any good ſeruice at the hands of ſuch diſordered troups. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of k. <hi>Henrie</hi> the L. of <hi>Iaille</hi> was made Colonel, who in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition into the fontiers of <hi>Picardie,</hi> had ſo bad hap y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his men fled (as it is ſaid) before they came to battel, which brought the <hi>Arrier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> into ſuch conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery man laughed them to ſcorue.

Now wil I proceed to ſpeak of the abuſes, eſpecially of one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in the taxing of fees: wherin it is often ſeene y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a manor worth 2000 franks rent, ſhal pay but 40. franks toward y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Arrierban,</hi> &amp; others leſſe. Neither know I whence thoſe errors ſhould proceed, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are charged with the ſaid taxes, who vpon their perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular conſideration do defraud the common. In theſe daies moſt of thoſe that owe the ſeruice, both noble &amp; vnnoble, do acquit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with money. For he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhould ſet out 2. or 3. men of armes, ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for ſome ſmalſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me, &amp; thoſe are rare fellowes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſet forth meet men for ſeruice. True it is that when a ſmall fee oweth but the 3. or 4. part of man, they muſt take money, but ſo ſhould they not for higher fees. Then all that money (as I vnderſtand) is afterward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the treaſorer of the <hi>Arrierbans,</hi> who diſpoſeth thereof according as either the ſupertor or inferior Captaines do appoint. Whether ther be any fraud vſed therin I wot not, but do refer it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of others. Notwithſtanding al theſe defaults, yet when theſe troups are leuied (whatſoeuer mixtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there be) we ſtil ſee ſome good portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that old ſhipwrack, wherby I deeme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if they might be purged and furniſhed againe, we might reap ſome commodity at their handes. I did once enquire what number of ſuch men euery prouince was able to furniſh, one with another: wherevpon I was certified that <hi>Britain,</hi> which is one of the greateſt, might eaſily fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh 300 good horſe, then conſidering with my ſelfe of the reſt, each
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:8683:84"/>
according to the proportion either for largeneſſe or ſmalneſſe, I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered that all <hi>France</hi> by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerting the kind of men into horſmen, was able to bring into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field 2500. horſe, which is no ſmal power. This ancient order is yet in practiſe in the Turkiſh Empire. For there the moſt part of the horſmen are entertained of the lands that are giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to euerie horſman for his life time, which is called <hi>Timar,</hi> and it is a tenure ſomwhat reſembling our fees, exceyting the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge of <hi>Iuſtice.</hi> And when the <hi>Beglierbei</hi> (who are gouernors of prouinces) do ſend for men, they al come to yeeld their ſeruice, as being therevnto bound in paine of depriuation from the benefite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. Without the diligent obſeruing of this rule, the Turke could neuer be able to bring halfe ſo many horſe into the field as he doth: neither to maintaine warres ſo long. Whereby it appeareth that the barbarous nations haue better obſerued the conſideration of their eſtate than we. <hi>Froſſart</hi> writeth, that in a iourney that K. <hi>Charles the</hi> 6. made againſt the <hi>Flemings</hi> whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> k. of <hi>England</hi> fauored, at his entry into their country had aboue 22000. ſpeares, ſuch a number as ſufficiently teſtifieth the plentie of nobilitie theu in <hi>France:</hi> as alſo the good order to call them together, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the <hi>Ban and Arrierban.</hi> But ſince the men of arms were inſtituted, I aſſure my ſelfe there were neuer ſeene together 2000. ſpeares, except at the iourney to <hi>Valenciens.</hi> This exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple haue I alleaged to the end to driue thoſe that know not of what ſtrength &amp; power the ancient things haue ben, from finding fault with them.</p>
               <p>Now is it meete that I diſcourſe of the meanes how to reſtore theſe old ruines, as men do ſuch houſes, as in proceſſe of time are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fallen downe: but when they fall into a good huſbands hands, he trimmeth vp ſome ſmall corner of them, making it habitable: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo muſt we alſo, if it be poſſible, deale herein, which were eaſie to do, if the maiſter of the houſe would bend his affection any whit thereto. For when our kings are willing and do but ſpeak, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition <note place="margin">The meanes to reſtabliſhe the Arrierbanes.</note> to obedience is great. The firſt thing wherby I thinke it were good to beginne, were to create ſome Prince or Marſhall of <hi>France,</hi> generall of al the <hi>Arrierbans</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> And notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the firſt bluſh it ſeemeth ridiculous to commit vnto ſuch great perſonages a charge accounted ſo vnworthie, yet is it all but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit: for if it may be reſtored I wil proue it to be honorable: &amp; we muſt think that the credit of the Captaine is of great force in this caſe: for whereas now a number of Gentlemen do diſdain to march vnder the banners of the Nobles, then would they willingly come
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:8683:84"/>
in, if they might ſee Princes or ſuch other greate eſtates be their guides &amp; conducters. And they likewiſe reſpecting their honours, would labor to iucite the better ſort of men to enter the ſame dance: neither is it to be doubted but their motions &amp; example would win many, conſidering the French honour which is readie to embrace thoſe things wherin there is any likelihood of winning praiſe. Next it were requiſite in euery gouernment that comprehendeth diuerſe bailiwicks to eſtabliſh one Captaine to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand ouer thoſe perſons that ſhould be therin taken. And where we haue alredy ſhewed that out of <hi>Britaine</hi> might be brought 300. good horſe, which counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile three companies of men of arms, &amp; out of leſſer gouerume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts 100. at the leaſt: are theſe to be accounted a ſmall charge? yea, I wold who euer it were, that he were ſuch a one as might be thought to deſerue it. It is moſt certain y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in euery Prouince there be ſuch like that are vnprouided for, &amp; would be glad to take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch functions, when they ſee themſelues vnder the gouernment of the mightie, &amp; withall would delight, each one in his quarter, to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their troupes. So would it follow that the ſimple Captaines of bailiwickes would alſo amend, knowing that their men ſhoulde march in the armies and not be alwaies tied to keepe the houſe. If therefore the Captaines were ſuch, the nobilitie would of neceſſitie gather to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as is aforeſayd. And for my part I will neuer diſpute whether being well led they would not ſufficiently do their duties. It wer likewiſe requiſite to obſerue one ſtraight rule, which is, not to admit into the companies that are erected in Bailiwickes anie other than ſhall be fit for armes, &amp; to reiect thoſe that being ſent are incapable. For it is moſt certaine that abroad in the countrie there dwell poore gentlemen enow &amp; other braue ſouldiors that haue but ſmal liuing, &amp; wold be glad to be inrouled, &amp; when any of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd that ought to ſend one or two, ſhould chaunce to ſet forth ſome great lubber to ſerue in his ſtead for his owne commodity, the ſame ſhould be reiected, &amp; one of the aforenamed put in his place. For ſo do the decrees of k. <hi>Henrie</hi> as I remember, import. Yea, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt not the L. of the fee from this perſonall ſeruice, but in caſe of ſickneſſe or age. But if we ſhould ſee ſome one vnfit &amp; not greatlie affected to warres, the ſame ſhould be excuſed from marching: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were he ſeruiceable for ought. So did <hi>Scipio</hi> when he paſſed into <hi>Sicil,</hi> for with the armaurs of 300. <hi>Sicillians</hi> that ſhunned the wars, he armed 300. <hi>Romains</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> did him great ſeruice in <hi>Affrick:</hi> Neither is it inough that the men admitted be &amp; beare the face to be
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:8683:85"/>
good, but they muſt alſo haue fit furniture, as horſe, armor &amp; piſtols, for in theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies I wold not wiſh anie but piſtols, as wel for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe armes are more eaſie to handle than the ſpere, as alſo to auoid the diuerſitie of weapons now a daies brought in, which breed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. It may be ſayd that it were a hard matter to bring them to this order, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering there are many that are charged but with an archer which cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teruaileth an harquebut on horſback; others with a footman, others w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the 3. or with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 4. part of a man of armes. The remedie herein were to conuert thoſe duties into coin, wherwith to to hire &amp; furniſh ſuch as I ſpeake of: but they that were bound to a whole man of armes ſhould ſet him forth at the full. But it is to be noted, that beſides the paie, the furniture muſt alſo be prouided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the duty is, a man furniſhed &amp; paide, &amp; not a ſimple paie onely. This difficultie may alſo be propounded, viz. that it will be hard to finde a ſufficient number of poore gentlemen or notable ſoldiors to ſupply the roome of the others, becauſe that ſo ſoone as warre is once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, euerie man ſtraight taketh a part: but they that make this obiection haue not ſufficiently conſidered the multitude of men in <hi>France:</hi> for ſtil we haue enow that keep home, which my ſelfe haue many times noted, &amp; therfore this need is not to be feared. Alſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der once ſet downe, &amp; that the piſtoller ſhould haue giuen him 30. crownes to arme himſelfe, &amp; other 30. for his 3. moneths paie, wee ſhould ſee men enough readie furniſhed of horſe or armour, or both, come to offer their ſeruice. And better to haue in a troupe but 25. good men than 100. ſo armed as is aforeſaid, which ordinarily are good for nothing but to ſkarre the peaſants and deuoure victuals. Thus woulde I wiſh them to bee furniſhed: with <hi>blacke Corſlets</hi> ſomewhat light (for the heauy doe but cloy them) <hi>Taſes, Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons,</hi> and <hi>Burgu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Their march after the manner of <hi>Reiſters,</hi> that is, three and three, and to fight in ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, for who ſo vſeth otherwiſe, is deceiued. And thus ſhould the bailie or ſteward order his men to bring them to the Captain of his prouince. Likewiſe this order ſhould be obſerued: that every 6. ſcore horſe, or 100. at the leaſt might raiſe a banner &amp; make a companie. <note place="margin">Of the vſe of well ordered A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

many Gentlemen &amp; good Captaines that would not faile in their duties: wherof in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> armies but one halfe were to bee vſed for feare of vnfurniſhing the prouinces, and the ſame would amount vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 1200. horſe. And in my opinion that Prince were farre out of taſte that would diſdaine to command ouer ſuch a companie which vpon neceſſity might ſeeme to ſight in flanke of a king in two great ſquadrons. Neither is it yet al to haue propounded this braue pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne and ſet downe orders: for ſmall fruit would ariſe hereof, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we ſhould prouide for two pointes of great conſideration. The one to make a more iuſt valuation of that which the fees ought to coutribute: the other to cut off vnneceſſarie exemptions. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the firſt, many abuſes are therein committed. For ſundry doe ſpare themſelues, and burthen their neighbours, or fauour o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that once I heard of a fee not worth aboue 400. franks by yere, belonging to an ancient Gentleman, that in his youth had done verie good ſeruice, rated at 80. franks for the <hi>Arrierban.</hi> And of another goodly manor hard by it, worth 1800. which a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate had ſcratched in with 4. hands, rated but at 35. This is the goodly equality many times obſerued in ſuch affaires. Wherfore to preuent all ſuch deceits, it were requiſite in euery bailiwick to choſe ſix men of the three eſtates, honorable &amp; honeſt men (becauſe at this daie the fees are diuided amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them) to aſſiſt at the taxing, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end to draw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neerer to reaſon: ſo do I imagine that if we ſhould take but the tenth part of the ſayd fees the king ſhould be well ſerued, &amp; the priuate parties haue no great cauſe to complaine. It were alſo good to haue regard to the perſons: For there were no reaſon as much to charge him, who after a ſorte ſerueth the common wealth, or is vertuous, or that hath bene employed in good ſeruice, as a greate feed vſurer, at whoſe gate the poore die for hunger, or a pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie fogger that continually troubleth his neighbours. Thus might men that would incroch fees be accuſtomed to abandon their euill manners that hurt others. <note place="margin">Anſwere to thoſe that wil haue no refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note>

               <p>I knowe verie well that vpon this reuiew, ſundry will crie out, and that peraduenture with ſound heart, ſaying: <hi>What doo ye ſeeke to alter?

If he be a warriour, he complaineth wrongfully, conſidering that going to ſerue he is exempt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paiments. If he go not to the war he is either vertuous or vicious: if vertuous, he will conſider that if it be a point of diſhoneſtie to denie priuate bonds, much more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſtie is it to denie publike. And then it is to be ſuppoſed, he wil yeeld to reaſon. But if hee bee one of them that doth but beare the name of gentilitie which he blemiſheth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vicious actions, I would ſet before him the cuſtome practiſed by our ancient <hi>Gaules,</hi> in the time of <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> which was this. After the precepts directed forth for the aſſembling of the nobilitie, he that came after the time limited, not letted but by his owne negligence, was put to death in ſight of the whole armie, thereby to warne the reſt to be more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. For ſo might he gather, that if in thoſe daies they did ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely puniſh their ſloth that were willing to ſerue: their ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that will neither helpe in perſon nor in purſe deſerueth much greater puniſhment. As for the vnnoble that haue fees, ſuch as haue anie iudgement, or are endued with any indifferency or knowledge, either be put in office, ſhould not murmure when they are called v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon to giue ſome ſmall portion to be exempt from perſonall ſeruice whereto they are vnmeet. Neither wil they in anie wiſe refuſe ſo to do. But as for thoſe who as much vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an earneſt deſire to be called Lords, as for couetize, do nothing but heape fee vpon fee, &amp; do ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerue the common wealth, nor vſe charitie, &amp; yet would excuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſcharging thoſe moſt ancient duties, which I doubt whether euen the Kings can bee excuſed of, ought to bee charged double, like the Aſſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath a ſtrong back, to teach them to bee more willing. Should they not conſider y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are vnworthy the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues &amp; honors of fees, ſith they are vncapable of military actions which ought to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> do poſſeſſe them? They that ſéek nothing but ſtarting holes, will yet ſaie that the king raiſeth ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the people for the paie of his men of armes, which ſheweth that noble mens lands ſhould be quite diſcharged. Truely they doe wel fulfil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rule of iuſtice, making it to yeld to their owne profit, &amp; ſtraining it to the ouerthrow of others.

is the cauſe of this diminiſhing through the lyberalities, which without giuing to him to vnderſtande the conſequences, they force at his handes: ſo is it his part alſo to enquire what may iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie be granted, and to cut off whatſoeuer is vnneceſſarie. Wherfore it were requiſite the Captaine generall ſhould be carefull to obtain of him a declaration, for a rule in the Prouinces.

But to ſuffer them to hurt, or by armes to aſſault each other, and not to reſtraine them, we haue verie few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, vnleſſe among the barbarous nations. For ſo ſhould wee ſubmit the lawes, which are rather made to ſuppreſſe violence, to the imperfections of men.

Thus are the euills that in old time were ſmall, toward the end of this age wonderfully increaſed, ſo as we may ſay them to be rather our ſinnes than the ſinnes of our fathers.</p>
               <p>Some haue imagined that our troubles haue bred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing <note place="margin">The diuers cauſes of Combates.</note> the ancient co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cord &amp; exaſperating the minds of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

For ſince y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exerciſe of fencing, which of it ſelfe is come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dable, came to be vſed, alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſpecially haue found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be perfectly inſtructed therin, they haue imagined y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might braue it out at their pleaſures, &amp; obtaine reputation of valiancie, conſidering that experience teacheth, that he that is perfect in the vſe of his wepon, &amp; withall wanteth no courage, hath almoſt alwaies the better hand of him that is ignorant, and in deed there is no doubt but the ſkilfull hath great aduantage of the vnſkilfull. Thus are men entered into a foule abuſe, in vſing ſuch ſkill as they haue attained vnto, to the wronging of others: which ought not to be imploied, but to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of life, &amp; that in caſe of neceſſity. The 2. cauſe is, the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:8683:88"/>
For ſeeing ſuch diſorders to eſcape without puniſhment, it hath emboldned them not only to fight one with another, but alſo to put in execution moſt villanous reuenges.</p>
               <p>The fourth hath growen, becauſe men haue tied honour to the mangling of arms and legs, &amp; mayming or killing one of another, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nobilitie hauing noted (as couetous of glorie) haue ſought by ſuch meanes to attaine thereto.</p>
               <p>Of all theſe cauſes, together with the had affections which theſe <note place="margin">Of what partes the monſter named Quarel doth conſiſt.</note> long ciuill warres haue ingendered, is this hideous beaſt <hi>Quarell</hi> formed, which intruding it ſelfe among the nobilitie, dooth vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by little and little deuour the ſame. What a deede was that of the ſixe Gentlemen of the Court, who appointing to meet at the <hi>Tournels</hi> were ſo fleſhed each vpon other, that foure of them there remayned, and the other two were ſore wounded. There were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them ſuch as in time might haue attayned to great dignitie, &amp; yet lead by extreame follie, choſe rather to periſh in the flower of their age, which was lamentable. Diuerſe other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bats there haue ben both in <hi>Paris</hi> and at the Court, which haue ſent many valiant perſons to the graue. In the meane time throughout all the other Prouinces euerie one haue not bene at reſt, for ſome of them haue we ſeene diſquieted and ſpotted with the bloud of gentrie. In this ſtate are we at this daie in <hi>France,</hi> whereinto our owne follies, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the tolleration therof, haue brought vs. And vnleſſe the kings diſcretion and authoritie doe prouide ſome remedie all will ſtill empaire.</p>
               <p>Now although I may freely reproue the corruption of our time, <note place="margin">Of the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Combats and thoſe of our dayes.</note> yet will I not thereof inferre that in time paſt men liued without quarels.

forced to practiſe this prouerbe, <hi>To day a friend, to morowe an enemie:</hi> Among all ſhames, nay rather infamies, this is not the leaſt, that a Gentleman, euen vpon a friuolous occaſion, ſhall tain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And yet if any would dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently enquire, he might finde aboue a hundred ſuch examples within theſe twentie yeeres: yea euen neere kindred cannot dwell long together without braules, which after bring them to blowes.</p>
               <p>I thinke that theſe diſorders are much encreaſed through the <note place="margin">Encreaſe of Combats in our dayes.</note> libertie of youth, which being crept into credite haue reiected all feare of lawes and counſaile of their elders, and taking bit in the teeth haue bred great abuſe herein, which cuſtome hath but too much confirmed. But wee are not to finde it ſtraunge that the firſt age which is accompanied rather with heate then diſcretion doth ſometymes diſorder it ſelfe. Rather ſhould we wonder that wiſe men and magiſtrates can cloſely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent and ſuffer ſuch things as they ought ſharply to repreſſe, to haue free courſe. I haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed with what inconſtancie men vſe to make quarels without any ground, alſo with what furie they afterward fight head to head. But yet is not this all the worſt, for others, which are no leſſe then theſe, doe enſue. One taketh amends with aduauntage: an other taketh cruell reuenge: one procureth the killing of his enemie in treazon with the ſhot of ſome Dagge or Harquebut: others doe make great aſſemblies reſembling pettie warres: and many tymes one quarell breedeth fower, and twentie dye for one mans offence.</p>
               <p>Theſe are vnworthie actions for Gentlemen, but among the <note place="margin">The ſtrange confuſions of the Combats.</note> reſt, priuie murders are deteſtable. But moſt of all I wonder at an other abuſe now in great courſe among the moſt gallanteſt, that being ſo pernitious, it hath ſo long continued. That is, that when any is diſpoſed to fight, he that is his ſecond, as we terme it, or his third, muſt alſo fight to extremitie with the ſecond or third of the contrary part: yea they euen ſtriue who ſhall bee one. Theſe men (in truth) may be termed ſcourges to themſelues rather then thoſe who clothed in linnen, with whippes in their handes, goe vp and downe with heauie cheare daintely ſtriking their delicate ſkinne. Can there be any more fond folly then to ſee a Gentleman againſt his companion of Court without any cauſe of hatred, yea perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture hauing ſome ground of amitie, and ſometymes his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yet through a certaine brauerie, goe cut his friends throate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In my opinion theſe doe but badly knowe the true office of ſeconds
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:8683:89"/>
in a controuerſie of honor. For as I thinke, they ſhould reſemble the Iudges that are choſen in Combats: who are to aſſiſt their friends: firſt as pledges of their faith giuen, as alſo to ſee there bée no fraud in ſuch an action, neither on the one part nor on the other, whereof they are to aunſwer. And next to bee witneſſes of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of thoſe whom they conduct: moreouer to agree them or part them in the field, as ſometnmes it happeneth, after blood drawne. But now in liewe of doing theſe dueties and fearing to quench their heate, theſe men doe helpe to kindle them more and more, ſometimes to their owne deſtruction: a moſt deſerued penance for ſuch an ouerſight. Some ſay theſe faſhions are brought out of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie.</hi> I referre that to the truth thereof, but now the vſe is ours, and if <hi>Iuſtice</hi> were reſtored and <hi>royall authoritie</hi> better regarded we ſhould become more ciuill. But I will alleadge one example to prooue the lewd conſequence of quarels, which is that vpon a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie growne betweene two gentlemen of the court, almoſt all the Princes and Lords with their fautors tooke parts, ſo as the King was driuen to ſend his guard to kéep them aſunder and cauſe them to depart. Now if theſe had met I leaue to your iudgement what a bloodie folly it had bred.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth wée haue entred déepe enough into this laberinth of <note place="margin">How to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.</note> miſchief which hath coſt vs deere, &amp; brought too much diſaduantage to deſire any more experience therof. And as the gentrie hath bene the greateſt fauorers &amp; nouriſhers therof, ſo muſt it be the firſt that ſhould helpe to deſtroy &amp; baniſh it, eſpecially if it mind the recouery of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which it had in the daies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great <hi>K.

Then was applyed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> prouerbe: <hi>To the friend as ſoft as waxe, but to the enemy as hard as ſteele.</hi> By which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies were ment none, but thoſe that were ſo reputed in time of warre. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was there great modeſtie among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſocieties of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie companions did long continue, &amp; friends obſerued the rules of perfect fidelitie. If any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie did ariſe, they al ranne to que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch it, where now they fuffer it to encreaſe, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end to haue the paſtime of the combat. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when I think of it, we muſt no more ſpeake of thoſe daies, leaſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnlikelineſſe of ours therto do make vs to bluſh for ſhame. Such as by nature are giuen to peace &amp; withall are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with any diſcretion, do find it very rude. For notwithſtanding they ſtudie to ſhunne all contention, yet are they ſometimes entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled therein through other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s arrogancy, which is ſo intollerable

that it ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth all patience. Thus are they forced to follow the wicked cuſtome, leaſt they ſhould be altogether diſdained. Albeit many times it falleth out y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they free themſelues from ſuch braules with as great honor, as their prouokers. Well was it ſayd of him that termed <hi>proweſſe and quarels two bad beaſtes:</hi> for worſe are there none to be found. I haue heard of a gentleman y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reported that for <note place="margin">The miſchief by quarrels.</note> ten yeres ſpace he was much troubled with 4. horrible miſchiefes: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which <hi>God</hi> had deliuered him. The 1. a <hi>proceſſe</hi> in law, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the one halfe of his liuing did depend: the 2. a <hi>diſeaſe</hi> thought incurable: the 3. a <hi>bad wife:</hi> &amp; the 4. a <hi>quarell</hi> grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great iniuries: among all which he affirmed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>quarell</hi> had bred him moſt cares &amp; diſquiet, with continuall torment, where in the reſt he had ſome reſpite &amp; eaſe. And this may well be: for he that perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himſelf that vntill he bee reuenged euery man ſkorneth &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth him, dare ſcarce ſhewe his face in any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie. He is ſtill in care how to find meanes to haue ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the iniurie that he hath receiued. His hatred to his enemie ſtil ſtingeth his hart &amp; the deſire of reuenge leaueth him no reſt. Likewiſe when he conſidereth the fortune of Combats, the feare of infamy moleſteth him. Finally, if he haue any feeling of godlineſſe or religion, &amp; that he thinke vpon the euident danger of his ſoule, if his body ſhould periſh in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite of ſo mortall reuenge, may not all theſe troubles be compared with the furies that the auncients haue ſo much ſpoken of? And to ſay the truth, it is the very puniſhment of quarellers, whom Gods iuſtice permitteth to be continually moleſted, becauſe themſelues will not ſuffer others in reſt. Many miſchiefes there are that light vpon vs, wherof we are in ſmall fault: but this our ſelues doe forge and take vp vpon our ſhoulders, at the leaſt they that will not liue without controuerſies. There be gentlemen enow that hauing had 1000. or 2000. crownes rent, haue ſpent it all in this miſerable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. If a man ſhould aſke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quarellers, <hi>What is it that ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth you, and cauſeth you to encurre ſo many hazards and perils, and to waſt your ſelues in ſo great expences? It is,</hi> will they ſay, <hi>the reſpect of our honor.</hi> Truely that is ſuch an honor as bringeth many miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: where it ſhould rather bréed content &amp; pleaſure. But I doubt if we ſhould more néerely conſider hereof, wee ſhould finde that the cauſe of this miſchiefe conſiſteth in our owne errors and follies. <note place="margin">The ſpring of the cauſes of ſuch miſchief.</note> And as the ambitious (as <hi>Plutarke</hi> ſayth) to the ende to hunt after a phantaſticall glorie, doe habandon the true: ſo haue we formed to our ſelues a falſe honor, that is obteyned by a certaine valiancie
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:8683:90"/>
(which yet were commendable in warre againſt our enemies) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting but in braueries, bragges, iniurious ſpeeches, outrages, ſtripes and murders, and all againſt thoſe that before were our companions and friends. This is a briefe deſcription of that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent honor which is now adaies ſo rife in our mouthes.</p>
               <p>Herevpon will ſome man ſay: <hi>Why muſt I beare wrong &amp; ſtripes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Of true honor.</note> 
                  <hi>and not reuenge my ſelfe againe?</hi> Hereto I aunſwer, that <hi>my entent tendeth not to will you to ſuffer all: but rather that you muſt in no wiſe commit ſuch iniuries.</hi> What then is true honor? It is a goodly praiſe and commendation, by good men attributed to ſome in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their vertue which by diuers good effects they make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of. And this conſiſteth in the vſe of wiſedome, iuſtice, proweſſe, temperance, truth, courteſie, and ſuch other vertues: wherof it enſueth that the ground of honor conſiſteth in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of vertue, wherewith he muſt be clothed that mindeth to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne to the fruition thereof. Thoſe therefore are deceiued that thinke themſelues woorthie to tryumph of the one, and haue ſo ſmally profited in the knowledge of the other: for it is as much as to ſeeke to haue the ſhadowe without the bodie, or the barke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the tree. I aſſure my ſelfe that the wiſe will chooſe to thriue by the waies afore recited, rather then by imitating the abuſe of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, wherewith they ſhould helpe themſelues onely in great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, as men doe with corroſiues, and not otherwiſe. For it may ſo fall out that a ſober gentleman ſhall be ſo grieuouſly wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged through the inſolencie of an other, that he cannot brooke it: ſo is he after a ſorte compelled ſomewhat to frame himſelfe to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, vntill ſuch good order bée reſtored as men neede not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the reproach of cowardlineſſe or baſe mindes. It was an old prouerbe, That <hi>men ſhould flee a hundred miles from an aſſault, and runne a hundred miles to a battell:</hi> which with greater reaſon may be ſayd of <hi>quarels,</hi> wherein there is leſſe honor to bee gotten then in an <hi>aſſault.</hi> It is but ſmall honor to ſet vpon and ouercome him that is weaker then my ſelfe: but if I maime him that is taken to be a braue fellowe, euery man will bewayle his miſhap and accuſe my valour, as hurtfull to my owne nation: likewiſe if it bee my friend and I kill him, who will not accuſe me of inhumanitie? Wherefore, for my inſtitution it were requiſite that all men ſhould know that the aforenamed, did force me to proceede ſo farre, which circumſtances doe but ſieldome happen. <hi>France</hi> hath at all tymes had many couragious gentlemen, of whom wee haue, euen in our
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:8683:90"/>
daies, ſeene ſome ſhewe wonderfull proofes of valiancie in priuate <hi>quarels:</hi> neuertheleſſe they haue not bene any thing ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended therefore as for other their valour ſhewed in ſkirmiſhes, aſſaults and battels. In the warres are wee to diſplay our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and liberallie to hazard our liues, which they that caſt them ſelues headlong into quarels doe ſeeme to make ſmall accompt of.</p>
               <p>Here might I yet note other abuſes in theſe caſes committed, <note place="margin">Of remedies for the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes.</note> but they are ſo common and ſo well knowne that it would but breed tediouſneſſe to heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repeated. And more meet it were to diſcourſe of the fitteſt remedies, for the baniſhing or helping of the ſame: wherof if ſome had bin ſooner applyed, they might haue done more good: for the longer wee delay, the deeper roote doth the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe take. Howbeit, it is yet curable, if we will begin our cure ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the cauſes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the accidents. The maner hath bene that if any honorable perſon had chaunced in any quarell to bee killed in the Court, by and by there were decrees and orders ſet downe to preuent the like inconuenience againe: which was diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued for ſome moneths ſpace, and then all was forgotten. This was as a man ſhould ſay, <hi>after meate muſtard:</hi> or <hi>when the man is dead, ſeeke the Phiſition:</hi> as alſo the preſeruatiue was too weake for the tyme to come. But we muſt remember that the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe is vniuerſall, and that the remedies ought alſo ſo to be: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that all the parts grieued, both neere and farre ſhould taſte of the benefite of the medicine. Sundrie bookes haue bene publiſhed which being tranſlated out of <hi>Italian</hi> doe entreate of iniuries, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendes, combats, &amp;c. which alſo doe teach Gentlemen how to ſhunne quarels, and preſcribe meanes when a man is in, how to get out again without loſſe of honor: among y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which, <hi>Mutio</hi> doth beſt deſerue to be read. Howbeit, al this put in one of the ſkales, the other conteyning corrupted cuſtome, hath wayed it downe, euen as a <hi>Portegue</hi> ſhould way downe a <hi>French crowne:</hi> wherein it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that cuſtome is much ſtronger then the written lawe. It is the <hi>Kings</hi> duetie to vndertake the conqueſt of this mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſter which glutteth her ſelf with blood. For ſo ſoone as he beginneth in earneſt to ſet hand to the worke, the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> will doe the like, and then ſhall the inferiours bee forced to obey. But ſith the queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the rules and deciſions of honor, wee muſt not ſeeke or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any other then from the Court: for whatſoeuer is there prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, is receiued and allowed in all the other Prouinces. The firſt foundation of this reformation muſt therefore be there layd, which
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:8683:91"/>
cannot at the beginning but ſeeme deformed, becauſe this great miſchiefe is very hard to bee pulled vp but by diſcending through ſmaller euilles, vntill men may be in ſtate to embrace ſuch good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts as teach that all theſe combats are not onely wicked but alſo deuilliſh, inuented to the deſtruction both of bodie and ſoule, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by no Prince to be lawfully permitted.</p>
               <p>But to proceed in my purpoſe: Concerning preſent remedies, <note place="margin">Of perticuler remedies.</note> this I muſt ſay, that it were good his Maieſtie, the Princes and Lords ſhould in their ordinarie ſpeeches which they vſe publickly, reproue <hi>quarellers,</hi> in liewe of commending them after they haue tainted their weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s with blood, and withall giue them to wéet that they deteſt them as men that haue no delight but to riſe by others hurts. That they ſhould admoniſh all men to gouerne themſelues with modeſtie &amp; diſcretion, &amp; threaten the tranſgreſſors with moſt grieuous puniſhments. Then if at the Court any ſhould ſo farre preſume as to appoint place to iniurie other, the ſame ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely puniſhed and not to ſpare any whoſoeuer. For 2. or 3. exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of iuſtice would correct aboue 500. And this is moſt ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerued in the Court of <hi>Spayne.</hi> Some are empriſoned in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: others are baniſhed for a certaine time: others are condemned to the warres of <hi>Barbary</hi> againſt the <hi>Moores:</hi> &amp; others are forced to make publicke ſatiſfaction: yea if the offence be great, the loſſe of goods or death do depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d theron. Sith alſo in our <hi>France</hi> this noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome humour is ſo rooted, it were méete the purgation were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſharpe, yet would it not breed ſedition. There are that hold o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that it were good the <hi>K.</hi> would referre the puniſhment &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of theſe ordinary quarellers &amp; murderers to the Iuſtices, &amp; himſelf not to meddle therein: neither can I miſlike it ſo farre as it tendeth only to moſt villanous wilfull ſlaughters, &amp; ſuch like as daily are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted. But ſith this matter concerneth honor &amp; armes, likewiſe that either good or bad inſtructions are learned in the court or in the warres, my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were that thence likewiſe ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede order &amp; correction. To this end alſo it were requiſite his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie ſhould aſſemble y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Marſhalles of France,</hi> with the moſt aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Capteines</hi> to make ſome good decrée for this matter, to order diuers things miſunderſtood &amp; worſe practiſed: &amp; to ſhew how they ſhould behaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in poynts of honor, which done, to publiſh the ſame throughout the Prouinces, their euery man being aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed might conteine himſelf in his duetie: ſo would good examples, conioyned with ſeuere puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, be no doubt of great force to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:8683:91"/>
the preſent confuſions and errors. As alſo it were meete the ſame were carefully obſerued in the <hi>Court,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> &amp; wherſoeuer there is any bodie of men of warre: for the youth from all partes of the realme do draw thether to learne, &amp; if abuſes do there raigne, at their returne home, they ſow the ſame all ouer: as contrariwiſe ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good cuſtomes, they doo imitate &amp; make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> manifeſt to others. The <hi>Gouernours</hi> likewiſe are to haue expreſſe charge ſo ſoone as any quarell ariſeth within their gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to ſend for the parties to ſeeke to agree them, &amp; if they be men of great calling &amp; the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very difficult, to enioyne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without delay to haue recourſe to his Maieſtie to the ende he may prouide therefore, as hauing great intereſt when his ſubiects do liue in diſcord: alſo if any ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede to villanous outrages, to purſue them ſtoutly &amp; without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons. And indeed I ſuppoſe that neither the one nor the other will be ſo blind as to beare with wicked actions. Some man will ſay: <hi>Hath not the King publiſhed ſuch commaundements enow? Yes, I confeſſe he hath:</hi> but they haue no whit profited, for want of putting in execution: &amp; how ſhould thoſe that dwell farre of obey them, when they ſee them euen in the <hi>Court</hi> vtterly contemned. For there all ſorts of iniuries both in word &amp; deede, all trecheries, reuenges and ſet combats are openly practiſed euen in euery mans view, without any great reprehenſion. If we wiſh good orders to take place, our <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> muſt bee the firſt that muſt obſerue them, and then cauſe others to doe the like.</p>
               <p>Something would I ſay of poynts requiſite to bee conteyned <note place="margin">Order how to make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to ſerue.</note> therein, were it not that I might ſéeme to enterpriſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe that ſhould be appoynted to doe it, whoſe ſufficiencie I imagine to be ſuch as not to need any inſtructions, ſith it is their parts to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to others. Howbeit, to ſatiſfie the mindes of the curious (who I thinke would bee glad to ſee ſome) I will propound onely 7. or 8. which firſt come to mind: namely, <hi>That ſlight iniuries proceeding of ſudden chollor or otherwiſe, muſt not bee refelled with the lye, in that the ſame is a word now too odious, but with ſome more modeſt deniall, whereto a man cannot reply with the lye. He that ſhall giue it, vnleſſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch an iniurie as being proued might breed to the gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſhall haue receiued it either infamy, or deſert of death, ſhall be driuen to amends. He that ſhall without cauſe wrong any man in worde or deede, ſhall be forced to ſatiſfaction. He that ſhall haue receiued any iniurie, ſhall not aſſigne any place to his enemie, neither procure him to bee chalenged vnder payne of moſt ſeuere puniſhment, as well
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:8683:92"/>
to himſelf as to the chalenger: but ſhall come before the King, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, or the Captaine of the Prouince, to craue leaue to redreſſe his wrong by armes: then if the partie that offereth the iniurie appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not within the third ſummons of his ſuperiour, he ſhall by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke placards bee baniſhed the Court, the Armies and the capitall Cities: and the other reſtored to his honor, as well in respect of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as for amends, and diſcharge of the combate, although the author by ſecret meanes ſhould labour to come thereto. And touching all ſuch quarels as the Gouernours and Capteynes cannot agree, they ſhal not neuertheleſſe haue authoritie for the deciſion therof, to graunt the ſinguler combate, but ſhall referre the parties, with ſtraight prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition not to hurt each other, vnto his maieſtie, to whom onely belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the graunt thereof.

If the partie iniuried practiſe any trecherie for the recouerie of his honor, the ſuperiour ſhall force him to amends for his cowardlineſſe. Likewiſe for thoſe who in the Prouinces through their quarels ſhall make any great aſſemblies, or with open force purſue their aduerſarie: becauſe ſuch are but ſparkes wherewith to kindle warres.</hi> Many other ſuch like articles may be hereunto added, which dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted into order, would beare ſome grace. But after ſome good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution taken for their well obſeruing, they may ſoone enough bée reuealed. For this tyme it may ſuffice to runne ouer theſe ſmall peeces, which I haue layd together to awaken many good wittes that I knowe in <hi>France,</hi> to the ende they may ſay better then I haue done, correct that which I haue ſet downe, and ſhew the great ones that it is their dueties by all meanes to ſeeke to reduce the Nobilitie into the way from whence it hath ſtrayed: for ſo long as it ſhall remaine wandring both in word and deede, it ſhall ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Uertue and Armes and waſt it ſelfe, whereas contrariwiſe if good diſcipline may force it to reenter into the carrier of our aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſters, eaſely it may atteyne to the end therof, where the crownes of true honor are diſtributed.</p>

Neither doth the great <hi>King Frances</hi> deſerue leſſe praiſe, in that imitating the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient diſcipline, he could finde meanes among his owne ſubiects to forme a mightie bodie of footmen, wherewith the more to furniſh out his warſare: For before there was but ſmall accompt made of them, as is aforeſayd. But ſince the ſetting downe of good rules, and that the exerciſe thereof hath enſued, they haue faſhioned themſelues, and are growne more obedient and valiant. <hi>Harquebuts</hi> came but little before into vſe, which haue made them very terrible and ſo neceſſary as they may not be miſſed. Sith therefore the experience of many warres haue taught that it is not poſſible to proſecute them well without a good number of footmen, were it not a great ouerſight not to lay any foundation of them: Conſidering that a meane hath bene found how to forme ſo ſtrong a one of Horſemen? For the ſame reaſons that moued our auncient Kings to ordeyne the one, may vrge them that now raigne to eſtabliſh the other. In olde tyme the chiefe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of warre were decided in the plaine field: where now they conſiſt in ſurpriſes, aſſaults, and defence of Houlds. Wherein the Harquebuts and Pikes are not only profitable but alſo neceſſarie. Now, if wee liſt to conſider the number of Footmen that <hi>France</hi> mainteyneth in the tyme of peace, they will ſeeme to be fewe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Horſemen, who in the tyme of <hi>King Henry the ſecond</hi> were aboue ſixe thouſand ſpeares. For excepting the Garriſons of <hi>Citadelles and Caſtles</hi> which are there to bee ſettled, the reſt is a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:8683:93"/>
ſmall matter. But for the procuring of a well ordered warfare it is requiſite there be ſome proportion betwéene the parties and ſortes of men of warre whereof it conſiſteth, as there is betweene the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a mans bodie: For either ſuperfluitie or want doe breed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie. And notwithſtanding the men of armes doe in dignitie ſurmount the others, yet doth it not thereof enſue that they ſhould in quantitie ſo farre excéede. The arme is more honorable then the legge, yet is the legge as maſſiue and great as it, yea and as profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his function. In my opinion therefore it ſeemeth there were ſome reaſon in tyme of peace to entertaine fower regiments of footmen of ſixe hundred in each, ſo to concurre with the force of the Ordinances, notwithſtanding the ſame now conſiſt but of 4000. Speares. I will not ſtand to ſhewe what neede <hi>France</hi> ſtill ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">Why France alwaies ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in neede of any army.</note> in of an armed arme: for all men of iudgement doe ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know that the Eagles of <hi>Auſtrich</hi> would come and eate vp her Chickens if martiall order were extinct. But many doe thinke the <hi>French</hi> nation to be ſo well enured to warres, that they neede but ſtampe on the ground (as <hi>Pompey</hi> ſayd) to bring foorth whole le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions armed: Howbeit they are deceiued, neither is there any truſt to be repoſed in that: For if diſcipline and enterteynment faile, the more men there be, the more is the diſorder and confuſion. Such as ſuffer themſelues to be abuſed with the noyſe of many Drums, with the ſight of many Flagges wauing in the wind, and with the view of a field couered with men, doe not wéene themſelues to bée deceiued, becauſe they thinke that euery one ſhould be as readie to doe his duetie as he is to make a bragge: but at the proofe we many times finde that a ſmall troope of reſolute enemies doth ouerthrow all this. Haue not wee alſo within theſe twentie yeeres ſufficiently felt the ſpoyles that a diſordered multitude doth worke, euen to their friends? All theſe experiences might perſwade vs that a few olde Souldiers doe profite more then a great ſort of rawe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilfull.</p>
               <p>I knowe that no man will ſay but wee ought alwaies to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">That footmen are neceſſary: alſo how to forme them.</note> a good number of men of armes: but for Footmen ſome thinke that in time of peace they may well enough be ſpared: becauſe the Realme for want of habilitie had néede to ſpare many things. But I will ſay, that if the Realme bee poore it will bee contemned: if it be contemned the more will practiſe againſt it: which ought to moue the mightie well to vnderproppe it with counſaile and force. I will be aduiſed how I will thinke our pouertie to be ſuch as not to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:8683:93"/>
be able to maintaine fower thouſand Speares and fiue and twentie hundred Footmen in ordinary, beſides the garriſons and warders of Caſtles. Wee might doe more, but when a little will ſuffice, a great deale is ſuperfluous. Now doe I wiſh that the bodies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments ſhould ſtill bee in force, to the ende the arte of warre bee not forgotten, not in ſpeculation but in practiſe: as alſo to preſerue many men of commaundement. I haue guided companies of 60. men, which in my opinion would bee ſufficient in time of peace. For when occaſion ſhould fall out to augment them, putting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euery companie the full number, they will in two moneths, as well through the diligence of good Capteynes, as by vertue of good orders, bée trayned to doe good ſeruice. But ſo will not the newe leuyed regiments: For if the Colonell bee a man of ſmall experience, he maketh but bad choyſe of Capteynes and they of Souldiers. Then as well the one as the other guyding them ſelues rather after their owne phancies, then after any good milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie order, it is not to bee meruailed though ſuch bad beginnings haue worſe ends. The like may alſo happen to this warfare: for if the Colonell, louing the Court will not remaine with his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: and the Capteynes do for the moſt part keepe home, likewiſe that as well the one as the other to the ende to furniſh themſelues doe make their prouiſion of halfe their Souldiers pay, all will bee corrupted. In a matter of ſuch importance we ought to be very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and the more that abuſes doe multiplie, the more ſeuerely are they to be looked vnto.</p>
               <p>The fower regiments afore mentioned would I wiſh to bee <note place="margin">The Ordering of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and the benefite that will ariſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> put in garriſon in the frontiers of <hi>Picardy, Champagne,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of protection, there to ſerue as well for the cuſtodie of ſome places of importance as <hi>Metz and Calais,</hi> as alſo to bee Schooles where young Gentlemen growne from Pages, and other youth might goe to learne the arte of warre: but the chiefe ende indeede, is to haue alwaies a ſtorehonſe of old ſouldiers readie prouided for euery neede. For ſo ſoone as warre were proclaymed and the King ſhall haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to encreaſe the companies to their full num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, amounting to two hundred a peece: we ſhould within ſome ſixe or ſeuen weekes be able to bring forth into the fielde two thouſand Corcelets &amp; ſixe thouſand Harquebuts, which ioyned with a parte of the men of armes would beare a good brunt, vntill the comming of the reſt of our power. Now, if euer, it is neceſſary to reforme our footmen, ſith the ciuill warres haue ſo corrupted them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> either they
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:8683:94"/>
cannot or will not almoſt obey: onely breeding terror where they march and ſcath where they continue. In theſe daies when a yong man commeth newly into a regiment of Footmen, I preſume that he learneth ſome feates of warre, alſo to be the more couragious: but it is to bee feared leaſt in the ſame Schoole he get as great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, which darken all the good that he had learned, as I haue ſhewed els where. Where co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe theſe fower regiments would be as it were great ſprings from whence would flowe none but fayre and cleere water, which ſhedding it ſelfe all ouer the Realme would clarifie thoſe that are troubled. For diſcipline be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtabliſhed and obſerued, ſuch as followe the ſame, ſhewing themſelues euery where gentle to their equalles, obedient to their ſuperiours, courteous to the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and ſtout againſt the proud, eſpecially againſt their enemies, ſhould cauſe all men much more to admire them therefore, then for their bigge lookes: beſides the fame of ſo braue an inſtitution being ſpred abroad, all noble harts will deteſt the accuſtomed corruptions, and withall deſire to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues to the ſame. Had I not heretofore ſeene the like effects proceede of the like cauſe, I would not ſpeake ſo boldly as I doe. I remember that in the beginning of <hi>King Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds raigne, when certeyne Capteynes and Souldiers that had lyen two yéeres in garriſon in the townes of <hi>Piedmont</hi> returned into <hi>France,</hi> they were greatly eſteemed, becauſe they ſhewed them ſelues ſo ciuill, and courteous, nothing iniurious, and ſpeaking ſo orderly of the exerciſe of armes, which cauſed many young men to runne thether in hope of the like inſtructions. Yea, my ſelfe haue ſeene the <hi>Earle of Charny</hi> (one of the moſt vertuous and honeſteſt Lords of this land) weare the Corcelet and goe to warde as duely as one of the meaneſt Souldiers, euen in the tyme of peace.</p>
               <p>Now may ſome good huſband obiect that this multiplicitie of <note place="margin">Aunſwer to thoſe who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of huſbandry doe hinder good orders.</note> Capteynes and Companies, will much augment expences, which though they be ordinarie doe neuertheleſſe growe grieuous in the ende: alſo that it were better to mainteyne but tenne compleat. To whom I will aunſwer, that my entent is not to forme one full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment: for alwaies as affayres growe on, it ſhall bee but one regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but I looke to lay the foundation of many, which being good, all that ſhall be built thereon will take the like goodneſſe, that is to ſay, <hi>Valour.</hi> As alſo it would followe thereof that we ſhould haue thriſe ſo many men, which is one of the drifts that I tend vnto. For, as hath bene aforeſayd, theſe fower bodies ſhould maintaine
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:8683:94"/>
eight thouſand Souldiers, all which being incorporated therein, might be tearmed olde. They ſhould moreouer be ſhops, out of the which we might fetch Capteynes for our footmen: for in three or fower yeeres exerciſe, euen in the tyme of peace, a man of any capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie might grow worthie to commaund through often conference of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> alſo by continuall viewe of ſome image thereof before his eyes. As for the charge I confeſſe it would amount vnto about fower thouſand crownes at the moſt by moneth. But withall we ſhould mainteyne a hundred or ſixe ſcore men of commaundement: whereof many might in tyme doe ſuch ſeruice as could not bée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced. What braue <hi>Colonels</hi> haue the Infantery bred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe fiue and twentie yeeres<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of whom I will name but a fewe, as <hi>Charry, Gohas, Cauſſeins, Sarlabous, Pilles, Mounans,</hi> and the valiant <hi>Montbrun.</hi> It is to bee thought that this good order will raiſe vs vp more ſuch. Wee ſhall doe our maiſter no hurt in giuing him counſaile to ſpend a handful of money, to reape againe ſo good intereſt for it. The <hi>Colonels</hi> of theſe regiments being well and without fauour choſen, muſt alſo wee ſubiect to dwell fower or fiue moneths of the yeere among them: neither may the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynes haue leaue to bee abſent aboue three or fower moneths at the moſt. For when the officers be away, diſcipline is neglected and obedience loſt. Likewiſe were it requiſite the aſſignations of payment were certaine, to the ende the Souldier bee not corrupted in being driuen to ſeeke his liuing abroade. Thus would 15000. crownes by moneth ſuffice, which is ſuch a ſomme as our Kings ſometyme doe giue to ſome one man in one day. Likewiſe where our Souldiers will now a daies weare no Corcelets, the ſame <note place="margin">To reſtore the vſe of Corce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets.</note> might by this meanes be brought againe into vſe and eſtimation: which is more eaſie to bee done then men weene for: but then the Capteynes muſt begin, who haue reiected the vſe of the Pike: for they muſt bee enioyned to take it againe together with the <hi>Millan Corcelet.</hi> If they will they may alſo haue the Sword and Target of proofe againſt aſſaults and ſkirmiſhes. In the Companies one quarter ſhould bee Corcelets, (and that ſhould neuer faile) and the reſt Harquebuts. And notwithſtanding this were not a fit propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which requireth to conſiſt of as many of the one as of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet muſt we come as neere it as wee may. Alſo the better to bring our Souldiers into taſt with the ſayd Corcelets, they ſhould haue thoſe that ſhould bee well made and grauen to the ende the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:8683:95"/>
beautie might allure their affections. Thus whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhould ſée the examples of their Capteynes together with the great payes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to alotted, alſo that the Gentrie were brought to weare them, they would not looke for much entreatie. The Harquebut is good to trayne young men, and when they haue gotten ſome reputation and experience therein, they muſt bee afterward allured into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree which muſt be made as honorable as the firſt. It is in my opinion a poore exſcuſe to ſay, <hi>The Souldier will not do this or that:</hi> for although in ciuill warre it muſt many tymes paſſe for payment: yet in a tyme of rule and reformation it is meete to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund with authoritie, ſo to make the Souldiers more readie to frame themſelues to whatſoeuer is conuenient. The <hi>Spaniſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanterie</hi> although it hath ſtooped to the ciuill warres of <hi>Flanders</hi> did neuertheleſſe neuer habandon the Corcelet: and the third parte of their beſt men doe ſtill weare it. Beſides it hath alwaies conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the obſeruation of orders: ſo as it deſerueth this commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in Chriſtendome there is no better Souldier. But will ſome man ſay: <hi>What accompt make ye of the French man?</hi> Forſooth I ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being well inſtructed he yeeldeth to no nation, as likewiſe for want thereof he ſeeldome doth any thing worthy reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance.</p>
               <p>I would wiſh they would practiſe ſome of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> cuſtomes, <note place="margin">Goodly cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumes obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued among the Spaniards.</note> which in my opinion are very good. One is that when any newe Souldier commeth into their bands, the olde doe inſtruct him in his duetie: if he tranſgreſſeth they reproue him: and if he be mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apparelled they helpe him, leaſt he ſhould bee a diſhonor to their nation: and he likewiſe taketh theſe admonitions as courteouſlie, where we doe the contrary. For if a yong man newly come into a companie committeth any folly, they all doe laugh him to ſcorne: and if he haue any money, he is preſently plumed either by play or ſome other practiſe: whereby many through this bad beginning doe ſtart backe againe. Neither will I here conceale an other fault of our youth: which is, when any man ſeeketh amiably to reproue them, they ſpurne at it, and take all in euill parte, as if their age were not ſubiect to doe amiſſe. Secondly, among the <hi>Spanyards</hi> ye ſhall not haue a braule in ſixe moneths: for they diſdaine qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellers and delight in modeſtie: ſo as if any doe happen, they ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour diligently to take them vp: and yet when they cannot bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded without blowes, they diſcharge themſelues honorably. The <hi>French</hi> Souldier is much more diuers, and can hardly liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out braules, ſhewing himſelfe but ouer couragious againſt his
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:8683:95"/>
companions. Thirdly, if a Souldier among them be hurt, he that hath but one crowne will giue him halfe. Fourthly, if any one doe any notable act, all his companions will praiſe and honor him, and ſeeldome doe they through enuy conceale any vertue. This like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is good in them, that in their militarie commaundements euen the braueſt Souldiers and of greateſt calling will obey a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Serieant: ſo pliable are they to their officers. As alſo when they are called to haue any charge, they doe as well keepe their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. Finally, in the bodie of their guard they will not ſuffer any inſolencie, but the ſame are as Schooles where their ordinary talke is of the dueties of Souldiers, Capteynes, Honor, and ſuch like matter concerning Armes. More might be here ſayd: but this is ſufficient in that ſuch as goe newly into the bands may knowe that theſe bee no <hi>cuſtumes of Munckes,</hi> as the prouerbe goeth, but of excellent Souldiers. If the Capteynes of the regiments aforeſaid would likewiſe take a little paynes, they might inſtruct theirs in like ſorte: and labour no leſſe to faſhion them then a horſe courſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This order likewiſe practiſed three or fower yeeres would ſtand the newe regiments, that vpon occaſion might be leuyed, in great ſtead. For moſt of the officers being taken out of ſuch a Schoole, would endeuour to cauſe thoſe that had before but heard ſpeaking of it, to obſerue the ſame diſcipline: ſo as by little and little the vſe of pilferie with ſuch other bad cuſtomes would be ſuppreſſed. Oh what a goodly matter it were to ſee the peaſant out of feare of the Souldier, who is in theſe daies a horror to the Villages!

               <p>Concerning the firſt point, experience teacheth, that nothing hath <note place="margin">Whether it be requiſite ſome of the gentry ſhoul be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowled among the Infantery.</note> more corrupted our Infanterie, than that our Gentrie haue with drawen themſelues therefro, diſdaining not onely to beare the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebut and pike, but alſo many times to take anie charge. Wher by are entered pettie Countrie Captaines deuoid of all reſpect of honour, and ſuch as ſeeke to inrich themſelues with the generall ſpoiles of our warres. Yea, if any olde regimentes haue obſerued
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:8683:97"/>
ſome ſorte the auncient diſcipline, yet are there many diſorders crept in among them. The cauſe that maketh the Spaniſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanterie at this daie to be in ſuch eſtimation, is for that their Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are ſo willing to ſerue therin, yea, rather than among the horſe. For there will they ſerue out theyr apprentiſhippe of warre, to the ende to attaine to be Captaines, which degree they make as great account of, as we doe of the Colonelſhip of a whole regiment. It were therefore good to commit the charge of the companies to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Gentlemen, who lykewiſe might chooſe to bee their Liuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and Enſignes, ſuch other Gentlemen their neighbours of whome there be enow in the Prouinces, as might be capable ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Thus through theyr credites they might bring in for ſouldiours other that beare the ſame title of Gentrie as themſelues. The Lord of <hi>Langey</hi> witneſſeth that the Captaines of the <hi>legions</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie</hi> and <hi>Picardie</hi> were all men of good houſes, and nameth the Lordes <hi>Bacque-ville, Cantelow, Mally,</hi> and <hi>Lanny,</hi> with others bearing office. Wherefore to reſtore into honour ſuch as we would eſtabliſh, it were requiſite the Colonels thereof were of perſon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous, in warre experienced, knowen in Court, and worth 12. or 15000 frankes rent, co the ende through their owne eſtimation to bring the office into credit. And although I heare yoke wealth with vertue, yet doe I make it but as her handmaide, for the exerciſe of liberalitie, which is neceſſarie among ſouldiors. We ſee that in the lowe Countries the chiefe Lordes doe not diſdayne to take the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, as the Earles of <hi>Egmont, Arembergue,</hi> &amp; <hi>Barlaimont,</hi> the valiant Marques of <hi>Renty,</hi> with the gallant Earle <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Mansfield.</hi>

Whereof the moſt ſoueraigne, in my opinion, is to bring men to it voluntarilie rather than by compulſion, which may eaſily be done if the Gentrie through obedience will begin to leade the waie to the reſt, who will not bee behinde when they ſhall ſee their Captaines which command them, take vpon them the vſe of the ſame weapon that they appoint to them. It were good alſo that the orders of the ſaid <hi>legions</hi> were ſuch, as the third part of the men of whome they ſhould conſiſt, to be pikes, and the fourth harquebuts, ſo ſhould the three <hi>legions</hi> containe 4500. corcelets, and 1500. harquebuts.</p>

Thus would theſe three <hi>legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> deſerue to haue place in the right and left winges of the army, becauſe their bodies would bee both bigge and ſtronge enough to ſtand, Such as will medle with warre, eſpecially in the field, muſt not deceaue them ſelues, but thinck that armies without battailes of Pikes are as armes and legges without bodies, which are moſt neceſſary to beare vp the ſaid members. Now let vs ſee whether this ſmale principle and order that I would lay in time of peace, may in time of warre make them as good as I haue deſcribed them. For my parte I thinck they will not want much. Which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe I referre to the iudgement of thoſe that haue more ſkil than my ſelfe, after they haue ſeene the end of this diſcourſe. They are to remember that I fit the ſhooe to the foote, that is to ſaie, the charge according to our pouertie: for if wee were able to doe more, I would not be againſt it. But whatſoeuer our eſtate be, we ought ſtil to prouide inſtruments wherwith to defend the <hi>Flower de luce,</hi> leaſt ſome pleaſant fellow delighting in her ſmell, ſhould plucke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the branches thereof.</p>

And no doubt many ſeeing themſelues requeſted by ſuch qualified Colonels (whome they doe both knowe and loue) will be readie enough to accept of the offices which otherwiſe they would diſdayne. Yea, it may peraduenture ſo fall out that ſome Gentlemen of two or three thouſand Frankes rent, (but valyant and couragious, which is the principall) finding themſelues conducted by a Captaine that is both their companion

If anie man deſire to know why I craue ſuch fellows, it is to the end that by theyr exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and credite, other more meane &amp; poore Gentlemen ſhould ioyne themſelues to the ſame bodie, as is aforeſayde, as beeing aſſured when a good foundation is layde, wee maye the more ſafelie builde therevpon, and our worke will be the ſurer. Then ſhould the ſayde Captaines chooſe for their Lieuetenants and Enſignes other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen ſkilfull in the ſeruice of Infanterie, and withall fiue others to be alwayes in ſouldiours roomes, who were eaſie to bee founde.

For it were follie to thinke without expenſes to make men ſubiect, either that without ſtudy in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, as wel by ſpeculation as practiſe, an many may grow perfect. The Captaines wages ſhall be fiue hundred Frankes by yeere, the Lieuetenants three hundred, the Enſigns two hundred, and the fiue ſouldiours each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one hundred, which to euery companie would amount to 1500, Frankes. Hereto might I a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for ten braue Serieants, whome I thinke alſo neceſſarie to be prouided for, 1000. Frankes, and for a Serieant maior 300. ſo as the whole ſummed together, this entrie and grounde of a Legion would amount but to 5600. Crownes by the yere, &amp; ſo all the three to 16800. All which is but the paie of three ſcore men of armes, and yet in the ſayde three legions wee ſhould haue aboue 240. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men bound and ſworne. Now as this maintainaunce ſhoulde not bee giuen them to fat them vp in their houſes (ſo it were loſt labor) ſo lykewiſe ſhoulde they not bee put to keepe gariſons, or to trot vp and downe whenſoeuer others liſt to ſend for them: but heerein they ſhoulde vſe ſuch a meane, that in receiuing yeerely all inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions requiſite, they might by little and little prepare themſelues rather for the ſeruice to come, that is, when warres ſhoulde come vpon vs, than for the preſent. Euerie yeere vpon a daie limitted, the Colonell, Captaines, and Souldiours, ſhould al meete in ſome great Borough neere to the chiefe Towne of the Prouince, or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other conuenient place, to muſter in armour, and receiue the paie aboue mencioned. Halfe the Captaines paie to bee employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the buying of fayre Corcelets and Pikes, which ſhould bee alwayes kept in the Townes aforeſayde, notwithſtanding the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:8683:98"/>
propertie ſhould reſt in themſelues; whereby in foure yeres euerie legion ſhould haue 80000, frankes worth of armour, which would be a great helpe to the furniſhing of them. The ſouldiours lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhould leaue their furniture in the ſame places, as well to eaſe them of the carriage of it to their owne houſes, as alſo to keepe it from embeſeling, for both going and comming they muſt lodge in hoſtries. Thus ſhold not the people be any whit moleſted: which were a matter both iuſt in it ſelfe and honourable to the King, which alſo would purchaſe a good name to the Souldiours. So do I thinke that euerie man at his returne home may haue halfe his paie cleere, except the Captaines that ſhall haue bought the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
               <p>But, may ſome man ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> remainder of this ſmal pay will ſcarce <note place="margin">Aunſwere to the common obiection of thoſe that ſhoote at pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit rather then honor.</note> buy a paire of hoſen, or make a man good cheere one daie.

               <p>But to returne to my purpoſe.

To be briefe, the Colonell ought to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploie his whole minde and purpoſe with himſelfe to beſtowe thoſe few daies in good inſtructions, and not in vaine riots, which I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine

would be of great vertue. This done, euerie man to be licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to depart vntill the next yeere, and ſo ſhoulde the reſt bee vſed. Now is the queſtion whether through this ſmall diſcipline the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed might growe more capable of their offices: Truely I doe no whit doubt, but as well the commaunder as the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhould be the better learned therein. For euerie man comming to this martiall ſchoole would bring in the beſt that hee had collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the deeds of our aunceſtours, which by continual confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, adioined to practiſe, wold be both ſeene &amp; graue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in memory. But the greateſt difficultie conſiſteth in knowledge whether when <note place="margin">Aunſwer to an other obiection touching the whole body of the legions.</note> the <hi>legions</hi> ſhould be perfected vp to their ful bodies, ſuch perſons as ſhould be added coulde in ſhort time bee trained. Heereto I ſaie, that it is greatlie to bee preſumed that ſuch wildinges as ſhoulde bee grafted into this free and well pruned tree, by taking theyr re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe therefro, woulde come in ſhort ſpace to beare the lyke fruit. And lyke as good Pilots and ſhippe maiſters do ſoone make their Mariners fit for nauigation: ſo, well taught Captaines doe ſoone giue their ſouldiours good inſtructions. Some will ſaie that our <hi>legions</hi> cannot be good for want of maintainance. I confeſſe they might be the better, but we muſt withall conſider that it would coſt aboue 900000.

It were alſo requiſite his Maieſtie ſhould deliuer to euerie <hi>legion</hi> flue hundred Corcelets, for the which he to paie part of the mony aforehand to the merchants, and appoint pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the reſt at the muſters. And ſo doth the K. of <hi>Spaine</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when he Ieauieth anie <hi>Germaine</hi> regiments. For he proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the moſt part of armour, otherwiſe the Captaines ſhoulde not be able to doe it on ſuch a ſodaine. During the warres they ſhould
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:8683:99"/>
be maintained as the ordinarie hands and at their feete, as alſo they ſhould obey the generall of the Infanterie. Likewiſe their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines being men of honour and able to liue, as alſo ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by their Colonelles of the infamie growing of diſordered militarie proulings &amp; pilferies, ſhould ſtudie how to keep their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies as compleat as might be, and not exceſſiuely to rob them as ſome do: yea, to helpe their poore ſouldiours in their greateſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie: but withall, when the warre were ended, they ſhould be paide their charges. If this order might come to perfection the king could hardly be ſurpriſed by anie euimie whatſoeuer, for in 6. weeks the foure regiments afore ſpoken of, together with theſe three <hi>legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions</hi> may be brought into the field, and their bodies furniſhed with 14000 braue ſouldiours, whereof to make foure goodly battailes of pikes which are ſo neceſſarie. Alſo if part of the men of armes and light horſe were ioyned vnto it, it would be a meetly ſufficient army of our own natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to defend our borders vntil ſtrangers might be leuied. I know ſome wil peraduenture ſaie that few meane ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours will ſerue in ſuch bands wherein we looke to haue all chiefe officers taken out of the bodie of the Gentrie: but for preuenting this inconuenience, I thinke it were not amiſſe to leaue ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours for the vnnobls, if by vertue they may growe worthy the ſame: as the Serieant maiors office, the Lieuetenantſhips of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, &amp; meane ſerieants roomes. Thus may they be contented: But the Lieuetenant, Colonell, the Captaines &amp; Enſignes ſhould alwayes be Gentlemen. Concerning the difficultie, ordinarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, which in deed is not ſmall, how to induce the common ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours to take the pike: I ſuppoſe it would ſoone be decided, when they ſhould ſee (as I haue ſaid) the Captaines &amp; gentry practiſe the ſame weapon: &amp; vpon occaſion to fight, ioyne with the body of the battell, ſauing ſuch as ſhall be appointed to lead the ſhot: as alſo to imitate the <hi>Spaniard</hi> who alloweth the Corcelet greater pay than the ſimple harquebuze.</p>
               <p>I haue heretofore heard ſome Princes counſailours, who ſought <note place="margin">Aunſwer to an other obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> to make their maiſters too thriftie, miſlike the maintaining of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny militarie officers in the time of peace, and peraduenture there be yet ſome of them that may ſaie that it were more meete to hyer one hundred good ſouldiers that might keep a frontier towne, than to enter into charges for that which I haue propounded. To theſe will I make no anſwere, but euen referre them to the Marſhalls, <hi>Montmirencie</hi> and <hi>Biron,</hi> two olde Captaines of <hi>Fraunce,</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:8683:100"/>
who vnderſtand more of the arte of warre than my ſelfe, and if they condemne me I yeeld: but I imagine that I ſhal not looſe my plea: for euen of themſelues I haue heard that the good Captains make the good ſouldiours, becauſe they be the preſeruers of good order &amp; diſcipline, which others do ſoone neglect, yea, euen contemne, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be bound thereto. But, will ſome man replie; can your ſelfe well performe the thing which yee tell others may be done ſo eaſily: Truly I think that it properly appertaineth to thoſe which now beare the title of <hi>Colonels of the Legionaries,</hi> and are better ſeene in the arte of warre than my ſelfe, to labour in it, and to reape the honour therof. As alſo I beleeue that in <hi>France</hi> there be 1000 Gentlemen more ſufficient than my ſelfe, and can better diſcharge it. Nowbeit, that they ſhall not thinke that I would ſet downe things that cannot be practiſed, and like vnto paradoxes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will diſcourſe (and yet are ſo ſtrange) I ſaie that if my King ſhould command me to try ſuch a matter (notwithſtanding I coue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And I aſſure my ſelfe the <hi>Zuitzers,</hi> who helpe themſelues with the pike as well as anie ſouldiours in the world, would be gladde to haue the aſſiſtaunce of ſuch a legion. This is my opinion. Wherein if I ouerſhoote my ſelfe, let men conſider that I am a French man, whoſe eares doe ſo gloe with hearing my nation ſet at naught, that I would wiſh it to do that which I know it is able, if it were holpen: to the end men might perceiue that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie and valour are not quite periſhed in <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Froiſſart</hi> who in his Hiſtoric treateth at large of the French warres, dooth greatlye commende the horſemen of his time, which was fortie yeres before the erection of the Ordonances. And by his diſcourſe it ſeemeth that they fought in file: hee there deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be well armed, mounted vpon mightie iades, &amp; hauing ſtrong ſpeares, whereby they might giue a great puſh. I doe alſo ſuppoſe that they choſe this order, becauſe the ſame horſmen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted onely of Gentrie, ſo as euerie man woulde fight in front, and neuer continue in the laſt ranke, euerie one eſteeming himſelfe to be in valour no leſſe than his companion: as alſo it is to bee preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that in thoſe dayes other Nations obſerued the lyke order. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> men of armes were erected they follow the ſame, &amp; ſo continued vntil the middeſt of the raigne of king <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, with much happie ſucceſſe. But toward the end of his raigne our loſſes taught vs, that in parte they proceeded of the weakneſſe of our ſaide order, and the firmeneſſe of that of our enimies. Then did the ſquadrons of ſpeares growe into credite, who (as I haue heard) were ſo aranged by the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> who meeting our files of men of arms did eaſilie ouerthrow them, which alſo the ſquadrons of <hi>Rheitres</hi> haue ſometimes done: neither is it much to be meruailed that it came ſo to paſſe for natural reaſon ſheweth it, which willeth that the ſtrong carrie awaie the weake: Alſo that ſixe or ſeauen ranks of horſemen ioyned together ouerthrow one alone.</p>
               <p>Some make this obiection. That when a companie is ſo ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forth, they doe all fight, whereas being in ſquadron ſcarce the <note place="margin">Anſwer to thoſe that would haue the horſe ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forth in file.</note> ſixt parte doe ioyne, viz. ſo much as in the fore front.

It may lykewiſe bee replyed that the ſquadron cannot ouerthrowe aboue fifteene or ſixteene horſe at the moſt of the troupe that ſtandeth in a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:8683:101"/>
haie, which is true, but thoſe ſhall be about the Enſigne, where the Captaines and beſt men are placed: which being carried awaie, al the reſt ſhaketh, and although that parte that hath not bene touch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yea, although three or foure troupes of horſe be araunged in a haie one at anothers heales, yet ſhall a ſquadron ouerthrow them all almoſt as eaſilie as the boule doth many rankes of ſcailes: So that there muſt be one force to withſtand another<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. If a Captaine hauing one thouſand Corcelets to ſet in battayle araie ſhoulde not make paſt two or three rankes of them, euen the ſouldiours would laugh him to ſcorne, becauſe by reaſon euerie battaile muſt haue his conuenient thickneſſe.</p>
               <p>The like conſideration almoſt is to bee had of the horſe, and I wonder it hath no ſooner beene ſpied: For if the two nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Captaines aforenamed, had liued, they woulde peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture haue taken order for it. It is not vnknowen to thoſe that were in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings armie at <hi>Vallenciens</hi> that there were nere 10000 French ſpeares: alſo that comming before the forte where the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall were intrenched, I noted that a bodie of three hundred men of armes aranged in file, tooke almoſt 1000. paces in length, &amp; the reſt of the horſes kept an infinite ground. But if the ſayd 300. men of armes had bene ſet in 3. ſquadrons, they would not haue occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied aboue ſixe ſcore paces in length, and the order had bene far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for to the end to archieue ſome notable feare, the men muſt bee cloſe, and the better to helpe each other, they muſt not be ſo ſca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All which proues may be ſufficient to induce our great ones to correct the imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our orders.</p>
               <p>Yet one example more I wil allege the better to diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

who were ordered in a haic and without ſpeares, might ſee how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily they were ouerthrowen.</p>
               <p>Yet will I better examine theſe matters, beginning with a ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron <note place="margin">A proofe that the horſemen ought to be brought into ſquadrons.</note> formed of a companie of fiftie men of armes compleat. Hee that liſt to make ſeuen ranks, his foremoſt ſhal containe at the leaſt fifteene ſpeares. Now is it like that thoſe whom wee ſet foremoſt are choice men, and the ſecond doe wel ſecond them in valour: and it is a miſerable companie that hath not at the leaſt 25. good men in it. As for the reſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I preſuppoſe not to be ſo valiant, they be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as it were in couert vnder the ſhadow of the former, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them to followe the more cheerefullie to the charge, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the head muſt beare all the daunger and hurt, which if it breake the enimie, they ſhall be partakers of the ſame honour. So that it is a notable ſigne of cowardlyneſſe, when a troupe ſobrdered dare not ioyne. Conſidering that the valour of the firſt ſhould vrgè them to the onſet, and the aſſurance of the laſt to follow and thruſt in. But when a troupe is ſet in a wing, although the good, which ordinarily are the ſmalleſt number, do march cheerely to the onſet, yet the reſt that are not ſo willing to bite, (which faine to bleede at the noſe, to haue a broken ſtiroppe, or to haue their horſe vnſhooed) doe ſtaie behinde, ſo as within two hundred paces of waie, we ſhall ſee glaſſe windowes in that long file, &amp; great breaches wil appeare therein, which greatly incourageth the enimie: and many times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong an hundred horſe, ſcarce 25. doe enter in: who afterwarde knowing themſelues to haue no ſupporte, when they haue broken their ſtaues and ſtroke one blowe with the ſword, (if they be not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen at their firſt comming,) do retire. And this ſheweth what difference there is betweene one kinde of fight and another. When I conſider of what maner of people the companies of other nations do conſiſt, and of what people ours are full, I wonder that wee paſſe them not in goodneſſe. For if we marke the <hi>Burguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> men of armes, which are in great reputation, we ſhall not finde much gentrie in their companies. In the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> troupes, which at this daie are the beſt, there be fewer: True it is there be verie good ſouldiours. But in one of our bandes of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of fiftie ſpeares which ſhould containe about an hundred and fiftie horſe, we ſhal finde notwithſtanding the corruption creapt in, aboue 60. Gentlemen, who reſpecting their honours ought to doe better than others of meaner calling: not that I will affirme this rule to be alwaies true, though for the moſt part. Now the meanes
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:8683:102"/>
thereby to furniſh out our men of armes with Gentrie, conſiſteth in maintaining it as in time paſt: alſo to make it inuincible, is to vſe it to fight in ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uadrons. And for my part I ſuppoſe that 100. varlets armed, manned, and guided, keeping this order, will ouerthrowe 100. Gentlemen fighting in haie.</p>
               <p>Some doe thinke it to be a hard matter to bring our Nation to <note place="margin">The meanes to put this counſell in Practize.</note> vſe this order, which is true in reſpect of great Lordes and wilfull Gentlemen, for that euery man coueteth to be formoſt in the march and fight: But in one of the companies of Ordinance the Captain doth purchaſe obedience, either by loue or force. And when this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath bene a little practiſed, euerie one wil frame himſelfe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. One thing we muſt note, that men when they come to fight wil neuer keepe their rankes well, vnleſſe they be firſt vſed to it in their ordinarie march, for from the leſſer men grow to the greater, and he that is perfecte in one is the readier to acquite himſelfe in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. We ſee the <hi>Reiſters</hi> and their varlets, who haue no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion than our French Gentlemen, religionſly obſerue this order. And to ſaie the truth, this manner of march is verie commodious, and our ſelues doe commend it in them. But endeuouring to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it, as a nouelty it doth by &amp; by grieue vs, as being too ſolemne. Which riſeth of our impatience, that neuer leaueth vs one quarter of an houre in one ſtate. But this may the Captaines authoritie in time remedie. Some will ſaie that three hundred ſpeares in file, maketh a greater ſhew than three ſquadrons of the like number, which cannot be denied. But for the fight (whereat we muſt chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aime) they are of no ſuch effect. And this is it that ſhould be well beaten into warriours heads. For the Captaines ought by inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to make them halfe ſouldiours, and by experience to perfect them.</p>
               <p>Let vs now ſee whether the auncient order bee in theſe dayes no whit to be practiſed. I think it may be vſed in two occaſions. Firſt when we ſend forth twentie or thirtie ſpeares, for that troupe being ſo ſmall may better fight in haie, where it maketh moſt ſhew. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when wee come to charge the footmen, it is good to diuide a ſquadron into many ſmall troupes in file, which may aſſayle in ſundrie places. But except theſe two occaſions, I would wiſh the horſe alwayes to keepe this order of ſquadrons. Beſides, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how meanely many are in theſe dayes mounted, and how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coward at the ſpeare, we wil be aſhamed to put them into a ſimple bodie, which were as much as to ſet them to bee beaten for the

As for the number conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for a ſquadron, we muſt in part haue regarde to our enimies or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For if theirs be great, ours muſt not be ſmall, and in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except againſt the Turkes three hundred ſpeares will ſuffice. And the third queſtion is eaſily decided. For two meane troupes hauing good coreſpondence, &amp; charging in ſeaſon, are, in my mind, of more importance than one great.</p>

But the cauſe that moued me heereto, is my owne knowledge of the greate want that our footmen haue of the vſe heereof among them: for the bringing of them in liking whereof, I thought good to make this ſmall deſcription, which I wiſh ſhould not vaniſh awaie with the ſound. For if ſome at the leaſt by the contemplation thereof could well perceiue the goodly fruite ſpringing out of theſe militarie ſocieties, I ſhould not thinke theſe my vnperfect labours (which haue bene the hidden paſtimes of my long miſeries) to haue bene altogether vnprofitable.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> footmen there be (ſo far as I can learne) two <note place="margin">The firſt kinde of Spaniſh Camarades.</note> ſorts of <hi>Camarades.</hi> The firſt are they whom the chiefe officers of the companies do aſſociate with themſelues, whom they doe defray with their ſeruants and horſe, if they haue any, ſo as coſting them nothing, they haue their whole pay come freely in, and commonlie a Captaine wil haue 5. or 6. whom he termeth his <hi>Camarades,</hi> (for ſuch are the cuſtomes of <hi>Spain)</hi> which do in the armies ſeke meanes to maintaine themſelues worthily, &amp; to grow to preferment. Theſe through their daily conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the Captains, who are graue, modeſt, &amp; diſcrete, doe learne ſo wel that in ſhort ſpace a man would deeme them worthie not onely to beare the corcelet or harquebuze, but alſo to commaund, as my ſelfe haue thought of ſome of thoſe whome I haue ſeene. Their loue and regard to him that maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them, is verie great: as alſo for his part hee eſteemes of them almoſt as well if they were his owne kinſmen. To bee briefe, they alwaies keepe the Captaine honourable companie in his lodging, and ſerue and ſtand to him in his affayres, beeing accounted as <hi>Shelmes,</hi> if they ſhoulde abandon him. Their Serieauntes, who among them are in farre greater eſtimation than ours haue
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:8683:104"/>
alſo for their <hi>Camarades,</hi> ſome couple of braue ſouldiours whome they choſe, who like wiſe doe giue them the third part of their paie to helpe toward their owne maintainance: and although they ſeeme thereby to be but as pencioners, yet do they beare them loue &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as they ought.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of <hi>Camarades</hi> is the ſame which is practiſed <note place="margin">The ſecond kinde of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marades.</note> among the ſouldiours, a matter ſo vſuall among them, that he that kepeth himſelf long out of ſuch aſſotiations is accounted as a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne iade that cannot abide among his fellowes. The leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of two, and the greateſt of ſixe, in euerie whereof wee may ſee the goodly images of brotherhood to ſhine. And this is ſo much the more to be eſteemed as it happeneth among ſouldiours, who might ſeeme to ſeeke diſcord rather than concord. Thus in the middeſt of the generall amitie which the ſouldiours beare to their Captaines and companions, is formed this particular heere ſpoken of, which is more liuely than the other: the originall whereof proceedeth of their mutuall knowledge, and increaſe of ordinarie conuerſation, &amp; the ſtedfaſtneſſe and confirmation thereof, of mutuall benefits. And for my parte I thinke it no ſmall ſtrength to a companie to haue therein ſome duzen of ſocieties of friends, or more, that haue care each of other. <hi>Plutarke</hi> diſcourſing vpon the ſacred bond of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yong <hi>Thebans,</hi> which was otherwiſe called <hi>The band of friends,</hi> did iudge it therefore to be the more valiant. And in deede they all died one after another in the battell.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, there groweth great commodity in ordinarie expenſe by liuing together: for foure ſouldiours may honeſtly maintaine themſelues with a ſmall matter, according to their callings, where one yonker hauing his ſeuerall table ſhall ſpend more than all they and not fare ſo well.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> doe vſe in their <hi>Camarades</hi> to allowe to each his <note place="margin">The Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of the ſecond ſorte of Camarades.</note> weeke to prouide and keepe account of charges, and hee that beſt huſbandeth it, is thought the wiſeſt, which is the thing that they moſt ſtudie for. For they gape after praiſe euen in the ſmalleſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as well as in the great. Seldome doe they incurre any want, for ſtill one of them either by hooke or crooke catcheth ſomewhat, which he liberally imparteth to the reſt, neither can they abide that anie of them ſhould be badly clothed, rather will they faſte to appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell him. But one of the chiefeſt fruites of theſe ſocieties appeareth when one of them is ſicke, for ſuch is theyr charitie, that they will one helpe another as brethren to their power. Thus much I will
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:8683:104"/>
ſay more, that this ſmall priuat life is almoſt alwaies pleaſant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their domeſticall conuerſation which findeth them paſtime enough. Neither is it cauſe of leſſe honeſtie, for one alwaies ſeeing another, euery man brideleth his affections as wel as he may, from doing any infamous deede, for feare leaſt he ſhould growe into contempt and ſo be baniſhed the companie of thoſe that eſteeme of honor. And to ſay the truth, I finde ſolitarineſſe to bee hurtfull to many Souldiers, who reſemble Apes, which when no man ſeeth them, are alwaies about ſome miſchiefe: and ſo doe they imagine to doe. Whereto is to be added, that if any of the ſayd <hi>Spanyards</hi> be ignorant in this or that, the reſt will inſtruct him with as good will as hee will receiue not onely their inſtructions but alſo repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. This is in briefe the benefite that they reape of their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marades.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let vs ſee how wee may ſo practiſe the like cuſtome, that <note place="margin">The meanes how to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in France.</note> we may gaine any profite therein, wherof others do finde ſo much. Concerning the firſt ſorte, I iudge our Captaines cannot ſo well fit themſelues therein as the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> in reſpect that they muſt then breake an other cuſtome, which hath taken ſo deepe roote that it would hardly be extinguiſhed. And that is, that they haue vſed to haue their tables furniſhed according to their abilities, ſometimes for one and ſometime for an other of their Souldiers, who would thinke themſelues contemned, if with that and ſuch other like fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarities they ſhould not be enterteyned. For the <hi>French</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are perſwaded that their Captaine muſt not debarre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his table or good countenance, ſith they ſpend their bloods for his ſake, and he who for ſparing ſheweth himſelf ſlack herein is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted a <hi>Chicheface</hi> or niggard: for wel for to diſcharge himſelf herein, he muſt not ſpare expences. So as if our Captaines ſhould finde three or foure <hi>Camarades</hi> aboue their other charges, they were not able to performe it without ſtealing from the Souldier vnreaſonably, which would redound to their ſhame. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldier do not goe ſo freely to his Captaines table, except vpon great neceſſitie, or that he be inuited: as hauing diſcretion enough to conſider that they haue other charge ſufficient, as in deede they haue. For ſuch there are among them as haue in their families a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue twentie mouthes, and thirteene or foureteene horſes. But their beſt comfort is, that their King as they ſay, will neuer leaue them poore. Thus we may ſee things fit for one, which in diuers reſpects that make the difference will not ſerue an other. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:8683:105"/>
the ſecond, I am not of the ſame minde: for I thinke it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that our Souldiers ſhould put it in practiſe, yea that they ſhould bee earneſtly perſwaded thereto, as well for the reſpects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, as alſo to accuſtome them to grow more tollerable each to other. Beſides, that in ſome one of our companies we ſhall finde that ordinarily the third part of our ſouldiers ſhall in the firſt weeke haue eaten vp their whole moneths pay, where if they were thus aſſotiate together they would learne one of an other to line, and withall each enſtruct his companion to ſhuune braules, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our Regiments are ſo ſore infected that in ſome one day you ſhall haue three or foure, whereas contrariwiſe the <hi>Spanyards</hi> doe deteſt it among themſelues. I haue heard ſome of the Captaines of that braue <hi>Tertio,</hi> wherein <hi>Peter de Paſſe</hi> doth commaund, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that in eighteene moneths they haue not had one, whereof neuertheleſſe they were not exempt through any want of ſtomack, for they haue as much as any men, but they are endued with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie, and doe knowe that their ſwords ought to bee employed in fighting againſt their enemies, and not in murdering one another.</p>

of the inferiour as to the goodwill of the ſuperiour. But if we conſider the martiall lawes and cuſtomes, we ſhall find that in ſuch actions there is more of duetie then of grace. And I hould that rule good which willeth that as the pay goeth before the ſeruice, ſo the reward muſt followe the merite. Truely if any men in the world doe labour and encurre great hazards in ſeruice, the ſouldiers do it. They muſt not therefore be defrauded of the rewards which euen the meaneſt doe hope for and the greateſt cannot be denied of. For their valour ſhewed hath a certaine attractiue power which wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth praiſe and garlands out of the mouthes and hands euen of the ignorant, of the couetouſe, and of the vnthankfull.</p>
               <p>Now, theſe <hi>Aduantages</hi> whereof I purpoſe to ſpeake do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt <note place="margin">Wherein theſe rewardes do conſiſt.</note> in coyne, and are ſmall reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pences, which the <hi>Catholicke King</hi> or his <hi>Lieutenants generall</hi> doe diſtribute to thoſe that haue done any valiant exployt: The leaſt are two crownes, and the greateſt eight. Alſo this is moreouer to bee noted, that if a ſouldier once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded doth againe any extraordinarie ſeruice, he is againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced. And my ſelfe doe remember that I haue ſeene ſundrie that at ſundrie times had ſo gotten ſome twentie, ſome fiue and twentie crownes <hi>Aduantage,</hi> beſides their ordinarie pay, which in my opinion is both a good helpe to the maintenance of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and a honeſt token of his valour. Yet ſome doe ſet downe theſe rewardes vnder the title of profite and not of honor. But if they marked the cauſe which purchaſed them as well as the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the thing purchaſed, they ſhould perceiue them to bee as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable as profitable. Commonly the General doth aſſigne them, becauſe that being in place he better knoweth thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are worthie then the King who is farre of. Likewiſe when any hath giuen his ordinance, he may goe where he will ſo he ſerue among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bands of footmen which are deuided into diuers parts of his Empire, ſtill he ſhall haue his pay: for ſuch debts are woonderfully priuiledged.</p>
               <p>I could neuer learne when this cuſtome began, but I geſſe the <note place="margin">Their originall and comoditie.</note> Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> was the author therof: for he being perſonally in many armies &amp; exployts, thought them neceſſarie for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and encreaſe of his ſouldiers valour: &amp; by the fruites which both haue and doe yet appeare, wee may iudge them to haue bene grounded vpon good reaſon. Wherin is verified the ſaying of one that ſayd, that <hi>where much honor was ſowne, great vertue ſpringeth vp.</hi> For the ſouldier that ſeeth his aſſured reward as it were before his eyes, neuer feareth, if occaſion ſerue, to hazard himſelfe to all
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:8683:106"/>
perilles, thereby to ſhewe his courage and deſire of fame: whereof it alſo followeth that he is the better affected to forme his life well. I haue heard that honorable olde man <hi>Peter de Pas</hi> report, that to his <hi>Tertio</hi> or regiment, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth of 23. <hi>Spaniſh</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, there were giuen monthly aboue 1200. crownes in <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages,</hi> which well teſtifieth that the ſame was repleniſhed with valiant men.</p>
               <p>It may be ſome ſeuere Cenſor will herevpon exclaime and ſay. <hi>Is it not an exceſſiue prodigalitie to giue away 14000. crownes by yere</hi>

                  <hi>extraordinarily vnto one regiment? Might not 250 good ſouldiers be maintained therewith? My friend, what ſtandeſt thou ſo much vpon the number? I graunt thou maiſt haue ſouldiers, but good ones I deny. For to the ende to make them ſuch, they muſt be well vſed. I meruaile thou canſt caſt thy niggardly eyes ſo farre into the lawfull rewardes of other mens ſo long labours, and yet turne them from thy ſelfe. For what els doeſt thou but liue delicately, taking no payne but to ſtuffe thy cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers with the riches of the Commonwealth, which doe farre ſurmount that which thou thinkeſt ſuperfluous, and which thy ſelfe wouldeſt faine catch? Hould thy peace I pray thee, or els my counſaile ſhall be to ſend thee to view the firſt breach that ſhall be made.</hi> But if any man ſhall thinke that I would ſeeke out among forreine nations onely all that is well ordered, to the ende thereto to giue due commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and proceede no farther, he is much deceiued. For hauing ſet downe that which ſo deſerueth, I will ſtirre vp our great men to imitate the order that yéeldeth ſuch fruite to others, thereby to encourage our footmen, who being wel ordered and vſed, doth giue place to none in the world.</p>
               <p>When I call to mind the ſmall order obſerued in the rewarding <note place="margin">Of the ſmall order obſerued by the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in reſpect of rewardes.</note> of our <hi>French</hi> ſouldiers, I am aſhamed that ſo much wiſedome as we haue among vs could neuer perceiue that it was requiſite to do more then we haue done. I know that he which ſheweth forth his valiancie may climbe to the degrees of the companies. Likewiſe haue I ſometime ſeene that when ſome had done any notable act, he was rewarded with tenne or twentie crownes at a time, though but ſieldome. Wherefore it were good either to eſtabliſh ſome more firme and continuall order, or els to accuſe our recompencers of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. But dare I ſpeake of the ingratitude often ſeene when there is any queſtion of the poore maimed, or ſuch as haue growne ould in our warres, which craue that we ſhould take ſome compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them? If tenne of the hundred be gratified, it is all, and yet
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:8683:106"/>
how is that? With the roume of a <hi>lay Monck</hi> in an <hi>Abbay,</hi> where after the poore ſouldier is come in, before he hath bene a fortnight among them, the moſt of the <hi>Monckes</hi> (as ſcorners of labour, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ſtripes, and louers of idleneſſe, and bellie cheere) doe ſo croſſe and moleſt him, that he is driuen to compound for ſome fiftie or ſixtie Frankes pention, and ſo get him ſome other where. Theſe examples doe diſcourage our ſouldiers and bring them to take bad waies, which would not ſo often fal out, if the order here propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded might be eſtabliſhed among our bands.</p>
               <p>But becauſe our <hi>France</hi> hath not at this day any ſuch yeerely <note place="margin">A meane how to eſtabliſh this diſciplines</note> fléetes out of both the <hi>Indies,</hi> as this great Empire which threaten it, it were meet, though we cannot do ſo much, yet to do ſome parte of that which were requiſite, ſo to make thoſe that beare the pike and the harquebuze to defend it more brauely and willingly. If to a regiment of ten Enſignes we ſhould aſſigne only 4000. crownes by yere for <hi>Aduantages,</hi> which ſhould not bee giuen but vpon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſeruice, and in tenne regiments would amount vnto 40000. crownes, were it ſo euil huſbandrie for the time of warre? I think, to ſome ſmall Duke it were too much, but to a <hi>King of France,</hi> ſuch a charge were to bee accompted ſmall, in reſpect of the good that would redound thereof, which would appeare in that the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier ſhould growe both the better warriour and the better liuer, when he ſhould ſee his labour and diligence recompenced. It is hard to thinke what a bad opinion ſtrangers haue conceiued of our <hi>French</hi> Souldiers, ſeeing them in their iorney into <hi>Flanders</hi> and warres in <hi>France;</hi> ſo diſordered in the fielde, &amp; ſometimes to fight ſo faintly, which although it hath in part procéeded of giuing them the bridle too much and their bad pay, yet may wee withall ſay that the ſmall recompence which they hoped for and hath bene giuen them, haue diſcontented them and cauſed them by all meanes to ſeeke their profite, ſith they were denied the rewards of honor. Let vs therfore growe more readie to amend our faults, and knowing our paſſed negligence followe good order, ſhewing to thoſe that being commanded doe ſo liberally hazard their liues that we hould them in ſome eſtimation: ſo ſhal we both conquer others and keepe our owne. I might here ſay ſomewhat of the great rewards and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honorable apparant tokens that appertaine to thoſe braue Captaines and gallant Knights which atchieue braue enterpriſes: But I will forbeare, becauſe my ſelfe am forced here to diſgeſt the bitter pilles of an apparant likelihood of perpetuall empriſonment.</p>

We muſt yet grant them the honor of being the firſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> brought <note place="margin">The Reiſters actiue with the Piſtoll: &amp; what aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they ſeem to haue of the Speares.</note> the Piſtols into vſe, which when a man can well handle I take to be very daungerous. They are a diſcent come from the harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers, and to ſay as it is, all theſe inſtruments are deuiliſh, inuented in ſome miſchieuous ſhop to turne whole realmes and kingdomes into deſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; repleniſh the graues with dead carcaſes. Howbeit mans malice hath made them ſo neceſſarie that they cannot be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. To the end therfore to profite by them it is requiſite to haue a merueiſous care, which no nation doth approach any thing ſo nere vnto, I meane for Piſtols, as the <hi>Germaines,</hi> &amp; that is the cauſe that I wil ſpeake of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as of thoſe who amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g all ſorts of horſmen that vſe this weapon, do carie away the prize. I will not ſtand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly to deſcribe al the ſorts which the <hi>Reiſtres</hi> vſe, for they are but too well knowne. It is enough to ſay that the offenſiue are as good as the ſpeare mens, but the offenſiue do farre paſſe them. For the man of armes vſeth his ſpeare but for one blow, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre</hi> carieth 2. piſtols wherwith he may ſhoot 6. or 7. times, which if he doe it in ſeaſon, doth great hurt. Euery man likewiſe carieth his ſword, whoſe effects may be equal. Sith then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> piſtol can pierce the defenſiue armes, which the ſpeare cannot, we may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that the <hi>Reiſtre</hi> hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduantage in the offenſiue &amp; is equal in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> defenſiue.</p>
                  <p>In fauour of the ſpeare man, it may be ſaid that he is better hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <note place="margin">What aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the ſpeare ſeemeth to haue ouer the piſtoll, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally head to head.</note> and hath his ſeate ſurer then the other: alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſpeare, when it is ſeene a farre of with the banderoll wauing &amp; ſhaking, doth ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie: whereto I aunſwer, that the maſſiue &amp; cloſe order of the <hi>Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres</hi> doth ſupplie the weakneſſe of their horſe &amp; ſtayes. As for the terror of the ſpeare, it is not of ſo great efficacie as is the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the piſtoll bringeth at the cracke. Let vs, will ſome man ſay, bring theſe two champions to fight one againſt an other, and he that getteth the better ſhall teach which of the two Squadrons ſhall ſo be. This obiection beareth ſome faire ſhewe, but it may be falſe. For herein perticuler reaſons doe differ from the generall. It is as if a man ſhould ſay, that becauſe in the field one harquebuzier may kill a pike man armed with his corcelet, it followeth that in pitcht fieldes the harquebuziers ſhould ouerthrow the battailes of pikes: which neuertheleſſe falleth out co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, for it is certaine that for the moſt part thoſe battailes do giue the victorie. But admit the ſpeare man and the piſtoll doe ioyne, the iſſue will be doubtfull, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I thinke if the piſtoler can keepe himſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ioyning head to head with the ſpeare man he may haue the aduantage of him, by
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:8683:108"/>
reaſon of the great offence growing of his weapon. If any man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that among the gentrie it is houlden for a principle, that a good man of armes may eaſely beate a <hi>Reiſtre,</hi> I will aunſwer, that the <hi>Germaines</hi> thinke the contrarie: namely, that a braue <hi>Reiſtre</hi> ſhould ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay the man of armes that commeth to aſſaile him, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie away his horſe: for they muſt ſtill catch at ſomewhat. Thus we ſee that on both ſides euery one will keepe his honor, yea euen to priuate combats.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, the principall poynt conſiſteth in ſhewing what the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents <note place="margin">Which of the 2. Squadrons ſhould haue the aduantage.</note> of them in groſſe ſhould be. For the better iudgement wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we are firſt to conſider of the valour of the men. Herevpon the ſpeares will ſay, that their companies being better furniſhed of Gentrie then the others, muſt likewiſe be more valiant: but withall wee muſt note, that in the cornets of <hi>Reiſtres</hi> there bee ſome fewe gentlemen and a number of trayned ſouldiers: and for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, becauſe they haue bene often employed by diuers Princes, they muſt needes bée ſkilfull in the arte of warre. Wherefore to make the quicker diſpatch, I preſume that in courage, experience and number both the ſquadrons are equall. Let vs then ſee which of them beſt keepeth order: for that obſerued as it ought at the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to charge giueth a great gird to the victorie. Herein wee muſt ſay, that the <hi>Germaines</hi> exceede all other nations, becauſe they ſeeme to bee not onely cloſe, but euen glewed each to other: which proceedeth of an ordinarie cuſtome that they haue to keepe alwaies in bodie, as hauing learned as well by naturall knowledge, as by profe, that the ſtrong alwaies carie away the weake. Alſo the more to teſtifie that they ſieldome fayle in this, whenſoeuer they be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in their retire and flight they ſtill remaine vnſeperate and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together: which the ſpeares do not, but rather for the moſt part euen in the ſhocke doe bring themſelues out of aray, which procéed of that that they muſt haue ſome ſmall carrier to ſtrike with their ſpeares: but they take it too long, eſpecially the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> whoſe heate is ſuch, that when he commeth within 200. paces he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to gallop, and within 100. to runne amaine, which is an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, for they neede not ſo much ground. Sith therefore that it is one principle that ſquadrons doe breake with the vyolent ſhocke which they ſuſteyne, may we not therevpon inferre, that thoſe that keepe themſelues cloſeſt and doe ſtrike with the whole bodie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, doe worke the greateſt effect: It is hard to denie it: and who doe better practiſe thoſe rules then the <hi>Reiſtres?</hi>

                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:8683:108"/>
Many there are that will not graunt this, but doe obiect that if <note place="margin">Anſwer to the obiection that the Reiſtres haue diuers times ſuffered the ſpeares to beate them.</note> there had bene ſo great vertue in the <hi>Reiſtres</hi> order, they would not haue ſuffered themſelues to haue bene ſo often beaten. Hereto I ſay, that the fault proceeded not of their order, but rather of ſome euill demeanour which ſome of them, comming to the combate, haue vſed. The firſt is, that comming within twentie paces of the enemie they haue turned their flanckes to them, and ſo diſcharged their volee of Piſtols vppon them: for thus (ſay they) more may ſhoote then if they runne on front: And then if the enemie turneth his backe, vndoubtedly they vſe him badly: but if he abide it, they fetch about a great circuite either to charge a newe, or to take newe Piſtols. Whereof it hath often come to paſſe, that they haue not had leiſure ſo much as to turne their heads: for their turnes and returnes haue bene taken for a flight: wherevpon they haue bene ſo hotly purſued that they haue taken their carrier out right. This <note place="margin">Ouerſights of the Reiſters.</note> euill inuented maner is more fit to play at baſe then to fight. And I merueile that their leaders could neuer remember that the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll worketh almoſt no effect, vnleſſe it bée diſcharged within three paces: as alſo that the troopes doe neuer breake vnleſſe they bee ſharply aſſailed. An other cuſtome by them obſerued is, that when the firſt ranckes of the ſquadron begin to ſhoote, all the reſt doth likewiſe diſcharge, and moſt of them in the ayre. Peraduenture they imagine their great noyſe ſhould terrifie the enemie, which perhaps it would doe if they were ſheepe or crowes. But <hi>French men</hi> and <hi>Spanyards</hi> are not ſo eaſely daunted. The inconuenience that riſeth hereof is this, that the laſt ranckes which ſhould thruſt forward the firſt, ſeeing that they haue diſcharged in vayne, doe in liew of going forward, ſtand ſtill, and are ſooner amazed then they that be at the head and in all the daunger: wherefore it is nothing ſtraunge that theſe euill kindes of fight haue engendred euill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. But who ſo liſt to marke the other <hi>Reiſtres</hi> that haue ioyned as they ought, ſhall finde that they haue made ſlaughters and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne the ſpeares, whereby their Captaines haue learned wit, and doe now make them to keepe better orders.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſpeake of the meeting of two ſquadrons: whervpon <note place="margin">Of the effect of two Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons when they come to charge.</note> I will ſay, that although the ſquadron of Speares doe giue a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant charge: yet can it worke no great effect: for at the onſet it kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth none, yea it is a miracle if any be ſlayne with the ſpeare: onely it may wound ſome horſe, and as for the ſhocke it is many times of ſmall force, where the perfect <hi>Reiſtres</hi> doe neuer diſcharge their
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:8683:109"/>
Piſtols but in ioyning, and ſtriking at hand they wound, ayming alwaies either at the face or thigh. The ſecond ranck likewiſe ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of ſo as the forefront of the men of armes ſquadron is at the firſt meeting halfe ouerthrowne and maymed. Alſo although the firſt rancke may with their ſpeares doe ſome hurt eſpecially to the horſe, yet the other ranckes following cannot doe ſo, at the leaſt the ſecond and third, but are driuen to caſt away their ſpeares &amp; helpe themſelues with their ſwordes. Herein wee are to conſider two things which experience hath confirmed: The one, that the <hi>Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres</hi> are neuer ſo daungerous as when they bee mingled with the enemie, for then be they all fire. The other, the two ſquadrons mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they haue ſcarce diſcharged the ſecond piſtoll but either the one or the other turneth away. For they conteſt no lenger, as the <hi>Romaines</hi> did againſt other nations, who oftentimes kept the field two houres fighting face to face, before either partie turned backe. By all the aforeſaid reaſons I am driuen to aduowe that a ſquadron of piſtols, doing their dueties, ſhall breake a ſquadron of ſpeares.</p>
                  <p>It may hereto bee replied, that the man of armes carieth alſo one piſtoll which he vſeth when his ſpeare is broken. It is ſoone ſayd, but coldly practiſed: for the moſt of them ſcarce caring to charge, doe referre that to their men, who haue no greater vſe of it then themſelues, and when they come to fight the one halfe doe faile, as hath bene oft enough tryed, or at the leaſt through euill charging doe no hurt. He that will haue any vſe of thoſe weapons, muſt bee as carefull of them as of a horſe: whereto it is hard to bring other nations, which accompt this a baſe and ſeruile occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. Some man may in the fauour of the men of armes ſay, that they may in ſuch ſorte ioyne the ſquadron of <hi>Reiſtres</hi> that they may ouerthrowe them. That is, that comming within 80. paces they may ſende foorth their three laſt ranckes of ſpeares gallantly to aſſaile their flancke, ſo ſhall they open it, breake the force therof, and bring ſuch a feare vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them that-the ſquadron of ſpeares may the better deale with them. Hereto I aunſwer, the obſeruation is good, though not greatly in vſe. Neuertheleſſe, it is a matter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as well to the one as to the other. For teach it to the <hi>Reiſtre,</hi> and he will pay you in the ſame coyne, by ſending foorth parte of his troope to ſtrike into your ſides: ſo ſhall your inuentions be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie to him, and peraduenture he ſhall preuaile more therewith then your ſelues. Now, notwithſtanding whatſoeuer I haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:8683:109"/>
diſcourſed, my entent is not to bring the <hi>French</hi> nation in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like with the ſpeare, which I take to be wonderfull proper wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons for them ſo long as their mindes are no otherwiſe diſpoſed then yet they bee. And vntill they haue learned more ſtedfaſtly to keepe order, and to be more carefull of their weapons, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer worke the like effects with the piſtoll, as the <hi>Reiſtres.</hi> Such as imagine the piſtoll to bee ſuch a terrible and offenſiue weapon, are not greatly deceiued: neither will I gainſay them, in caſe it come in valiant hands.</p>

verifie my propoſition not to bee vnpoſſible.

But he was not ſo ſoone ſet forward, but eightéene or twentie thouſand horſe of the <hi>Moores</hi> were at his heeles, who coueted to catch him in this bad aduantage. He then hauing ordered his battaile and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted his men, went forward on his way where all theſe horſe did fiue or ſixe times ſet vpon him, but he bare their brunt and ſo braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repulſed them, that with the loſſe of 80. men at the moſt he brought the reſt into ſafetie, and ſlew ſeuen or eight hundred of the enemies. Some will ſay, that they wanting armour did not pearce ſo ſharply as do the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> horſemen, who doe farre paſſe them in courage. I graunt ours are more valiant, but theirs did not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile very ſlackly, or els they had not loſt ſo many. And by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployt it appeareth, that footmen reſolute and well led may paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where. <hi>Guicciardine</hi> alſo in his hiſtorie reporteth a gallant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traict <note place="margin">The ſecond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> of 2000. <hi>Spanyards</hi> after the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> had broken their armie at <hi>Rauenna:</hi> for being ioyned againe into their bodie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the horſemen did follow and charge them, yet did they ſaue themſelues, yea and ſlewe <hi>Gaſton de Foix</hi> the conquerour that purſued them.</p>
                  <p>In theſe retraicts here do appeare great determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but ſmall <note place="margin">That ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraites may be made when the arte of warre and in ſtruction of the Soldiers is ioyned with bould reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> arte, which neuertheleſſe is very neceſſarie in ſuch affayres: wherto I will alſo adde the inſtruction of the ſouldiers. For when all theſe three things ſhall concurre in one troope, I doubt not but it may worke greater meruailes then the former. Some will ſay, that the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> can at this day hardly helpe themſelues with the pike, which is true, neither do I merueile thereat: for in deliuering both it and the corcelet to any man, men looke to no more, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath good ſhoulders, as if it were to carie ſome coffer like a moyle: and as for the gentrie they haue quite giuen it ouer. This is the reaſon why I wiſh the reſtoring of martiall diſcipline, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that they would againe practiſe the pike, wherewith to fight at hand and open, and to leaue to the youth and poore Souldiers the handling of the harquebuze, becauſe that therewith they ordinarily fight a farre of and in couert: for the one is farre more honorable then the other. Captaines in ould time, venturing vpon ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult enterpriſe, wiſhed to haue their Souldiers not only well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:8683:110"/>
but alſo old beaten warriours, becauſe their aſſurance is the greater. For it were but an ouerſight to attempt any perillous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture with newe men. Now will I come to Inſtruction, which is (as I haue ſayd) merueilouſly requiſite in extraordinary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And yet we now ſee that the Souldier contemneth it: and the Captaine careth not for it. But admit a Souldier bee valiant, and that whereſoeuer he be placed he will doe his duetie: thinke you he will not doe it much better, or that he will not fight more reſolutly, when before he hath by good reaſons bene perſwaded that the horſe cannot force a battaile in the face: likewiſe that for the flancke they muſt vſe ſuch fortification as I will hereafter ſet downe, then if he were vtterly ignorant and wiſt not what might happen? I thinke no man will denie it: for certainly ignorance is in parte cauſe of the feare that many men of warre doe oftentimes conceiue: For that ſeeing the enemie in their faces, they thinke they ſhould, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prouerbe, euen eate yron charets. I know that prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe teacheth to knowe the true from the falſe, but there is much time ſpent therein, vnleſſe it bee holpen by familier and ordinarie documents, which thoſe captaines that ſeeke to haue the beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies doe diligently giue to their ſouldiers.</p>

For marching but 80. paces aſunder and coaſting each other, it followeth that the head of the battaile marked <hi>A</hi> can hardly bee charged, becauſe the ſide of the battaile marked 3 doth flancke it, as likewiſe the ſayd head doth as much for the ſayd flancke: by the ſame reaſon alſo one of the heads of the battaile marked 2. and the flancke of the other marked <hi>D</hi> doe alſo ſuccour each other by their harquebuziers, ſo as it is very daungerous for the horſe to aſſayle in ſuch places which enterflancke each other. But may ſome man ſay, although the two battailes cannot be aſſaulted but each vpon two ſides, why is it not as good to make but one onely, which cannot be aſſailed in any more places? For it ſeemeth the reſiſtance would bee more gallant, becauſe that force vnited is much greater then deuided. I am of opinion that in theſe actions, it is not ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to looke to the greatneſſe or ſmalneſſe of the battailes, as to the difficultie and hinderance when they finde themſelues aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on euery ſide. For it is a great aduenture but there will growe ſome diſorder when one bodie muſt make defence in foure places: but when they neede not to looke but to two ſides, the men doe frame themſelues thereto with greater eaſe and much better order. This reaſon ſhall content me for the verifying of my ſpeech, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I could alleadge others.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the ordering of the battailes, I would wiſh euery <note place="margin">Of the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes.</note> rancke to conteyne fiftie Corcelets, whereof there ſhould be ſeauen at the head, which would make three hundred and fiftie, then tenne ranckes of harquebuziers, and in the middeſt of them the rancke of Enſignes, afterward for the tayle ſixe ranckes of Corcelets, which in all make ſixe hundred and fiftie Corcelets and fiue hundred har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers placed in foure and twentie rankes. For the flanckes, wherein al the difficultie doth conſiſt, they ſhould be ordered in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following. I would neuer place there any harquebuziers as hath hetherto bene vſed, but make ſixe rankes of three hundred Corcelets, in each fiftie men which ſhould ſerue to make head on thoſe ſides. The enemies being néere, they ſhould march otherwiſe then the reſt, namely cloſe and carying their Pikes vpright leaning againſt their ſhoulders, which is now ſufficiently in vſe.

their array with their face to the enemie, and by my aduice, they ſhould take but threeſcore common paces in length, which properly ſhould bee the ſame which the battaile being cloſed to fight, may haue open by the flanckes. Thus ſhould they bee armed to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the horſemen, which cannot bee well done but with Pikes: for the harquebuze ſhot without couert wil eaſely be ouerthrowne. There remaine yet two hundred and fiftie harquebuziers to bee placed in the battaile, counting the Muſkets whom I would wiſh to bee diſtributed into foure partes, in each threeſcore and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more to ſtande as it were looſe before the Pikes, and at the charge to arange themſelues vnder thoſe of the firſt ranckes on the foure ſides of the battaile.</p>
                  <p>Some will miſlike I ſhould make the heades ſo weake and <note place="margin">Anſwer to the obiection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer aduice.</note> only of ſixe ranckes of Corcelets, thinking them too fewe to beare the brunt of a whole hande of horſe. To whom I may ſay, that if there were tenne it were the better, but I haue cut my coate after my cloath: howbeit, I thinke ſuch frontes ſufficient to reſiſt the horſe, which may eaſely bée done, if the men haue courage and will be ſure to ſtand ſtrongly, and fewe battailes haue wee ſeene ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by any aſſault of the horſe at the head. As for the flankes which I haue deſcribed in ſuch ſorte as before, they be as ſtrong as the heades, ſo long as they can keepe their order. And this order I would wiſh them to keepe in their fight. Firſt, while the horſe were farre of, it were good the battailes did goe forwarde, but ſeeing them readie to charge, to ſtay to the ende the better to ſettle themſelues in order and with good footing to beare their firſt brunt.</p>
                  <p>The firſt rancke of Corcelets to plant the endes of their Pikes <note place="margin">How the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes ſhould beare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues either to fight or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</note> ſure in the ground, and not to ſtirre though a horſe ſhould goare himſelfe thereon: alſo to hould them about the middeſt, and vnder the foreends ſhould the threeſcore Muſkets and Harquebuzes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted, arange themſelues, with one knee on the ground to ſhoote the ſurer, as alſo to be ſomewhat defended. The other ranckes of Corcelets to ſtande vpright almoſt cloſe with the firſt rancke and to make the bodie of the battaile. Then the horſemen comming to charge, I doubt not but they ſhall finde themſelues ſhrewdly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed by the Harquebuziers, which ſhooting within twentie pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:8683:112"/>
placed at the head then here: for they muſt bee where they may anoye at the firſt brunt, and although the Speares or breaſtes of the horſe doe ouerthrowe ſome foure or fiue on a ſide, it were but a ſmall loſſe. For it is moſt certaine that when a Squadron of horſe ſhall ſee nine or tenne horſe fall downe at the firſt comming, ſuch as followe will haue an eye to their conſciences. Thus after the Squadron ſhall haue borne this ſharpe welcome, it muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſtrike vppon the Pikes of the firſt rancke, or els moderate the firſt heate, as alſo becauſe the firſt gored horſes ſhall bee forced to ſtande, and ſo ſtay the reſt that followeth. And although this defence might ſomewhat yeeld, yet ſhould they ſtill finde the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the battaile readie to beare their brunt, wherein conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the principall force. And in trueth I ſhould thinke it vnpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (if the Souldiers would not bee afeard) to ouerthrowe ſuch a barre: for we muſt thinke that though the horſes runne with great force, yet a ſmall thing letteth them, the ſmoake and noyſe of the Harquebuziers ſcarreth them, hurtes ſtoppe them, mens conceiued feares doe make them to pull backe, and the crye of the battaile hath ſome effect, notwithſtanding the greateſt of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of the reſiſtance of the Pikes. Beſides all this, ſome rancke of Harquebuziers placed in the middeſt of the battaile might likewiſe ſhoote ouer the heads of the Pikes, who bending themſelues to the fight doe ſomewhat ſtoope, whereby parte of the horſemans bodie may be ſeene.</p>
                  <p>Some peraduenture will ſcorne hereat and ſay, that all theſe <note place="margin">Aunſwer to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on founded vpon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilitie.</note> ſmall obſeruations were more fit to bee practiſed in Dances and Maſkes rather then in the warre, likewiſe the ould cuſtome haue alwaies bene beſt, though wee trouble not our ſelues with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny impractiſeable nouelties. But I am not of their mindes, for they put me in remembrance of many of our fathers that laughed at ſo many inuentions for the fortifying of the Houlds, tearming them <hi>Italian deuiſes,</hi> affirming that one good great Rampier would ſuffice to warrant men from the force of the Canon, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the which they might defende themſelues Pike to Pike. And yet experience hath taught vs that then townes were taken within eight daies, where now we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume almoſt a whole ſeaſon, ſo often muſt wee fight before wee can winne a Raueline, then the ditch, then the Rampier, then the inwarde trench. For if in the ſhould there bee one ingenious perſon and a Souldier withall, ſuch a one as was <hi>Captaine Baſtian in Maiſtrict,</hi> he maketh them
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:8683:112"/>
that are without to ſweate water and blood. I would thinke that that which I require in our battell, ſhould not be ſo hard to practiſe, ſith our newe Souldiers when wee traine them, doe make many more turnes and returnes for pleaſure. Why then ſhould not the olde Souldiers labour to learne any thing that may breede their honor and ſafegard.</p>
                  <p>Two other obiections may yet be here made. The firſt: that the <note place="margin">Aunſwer to two other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections.</note> flankes of the battell ſhall ſtill be much weaker then the heads: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the couer that I haue giuen them, conſiſting in ſo difficult an order, it is eaſie to bee diſordered. I confeſſe that the ſaide flanks ſhould be too weake to aſſaile, becauſe the battelles doe ſtill march forwarde and not ſideling: but ſtrongly to beare a brunt I thinke that obſeruing the ſame which I haue ſet downe, they ſhall be able to doe it, as well as the heades. To the ende likewiſe the conduct may be the better, I would wiſh to each flanke two Capteynes, with the pike; and of the notableſt ſouldiers. The ſecond obiection is that the fower corners of the battell, though cloſed, doe yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſomewhat open and weake, as it were for the ſpace of ſeuen or eight ſteppes, where the horſe may get entrie. Truely this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is not amiſſe, and for the remedie hereof it were requiſite in theſe corners to place ſeuen or eight of the braueſt Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers, who ſhould not diſcharge but vpon great neceſſitie, as alſo to appoynt the Corcelets of the 4. 5. and 6. rankes that ſhould be née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thereto to turne their Pikes that way to beare the brunt when they ſee the enemie approach. The greateſt daunger to all the ſayd footmen conſiſteth in the two firſt charges of the horſe, which it is to be preſumed, will bee braue: but being borne out, they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue great hope, in that they haue quenched the firſt heate of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, and ſo march forward ouer the field, caſting forth ſome loſe moſquets to keepe the horſemen a loofe, but when they ſee it come vpon them then wholy to cloſe. And bearing themſelues thus, I am verely perſwaded they may make a gallant retraict.</p>
                  <p>The better to comprehende this matter, the Colonels who in <note place="margin">A meane to proue what aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance is in this paradox: alſo a remedie to the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</note> their regiments haue many Pikes, ſhould ſometimes proue in fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned things how this order ſtandeth with reaſon, and peraduenture they ſhall finde them ſelues the better ſatiſfied, when they ſee a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and liuely repreſentation thereof concurre with that which they may haue imagined, according to this reporte. Some man will replye that the horſemen may ſo vndiſcreetly aſſaile the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that they may indeede ſaue themſelues before them, but if
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:8683:113"/>
they would charge them in ſmall troopes (namely of one ſquadron of 300. to make 3. each of 100. which might followe one after an other) it would much ſhake the battaile. For the Harquebuzery ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing diſcharged vpon the firſt (as it cannot bee denyed, but it will greatly endomage them) the two other ſquadrons following ſhall haue great aduantage, in being exempt from that daunger, and ſo there is ſome likelihoode that they may ſhake them. Truely this kinde of charge is very good, but it may be prouided for: for ſome of thoſe Harquebuziers that ſhould lye vnder the firſt rancke of the Pikes, may haue charged againe before the ſecond troope commeth vpon them, alſo from the two ſides that are not charged, or from the one, the harquebuzers may be brought to ſuccour that which may bee in daunger, as alſo ſome of thoſe in the middeſt may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhoote which being handſomely performed, the Corcelets ſhall ſtill haue ſuccour from their Harquebuzerie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for without this their defence would be but colde. To conclude, I rather feare that wee ſhall want occaſion to attempt ſo braue a retraict, either that wee ſhall ſcarcely finde any Captaine that will be the firſt to proue it, then that I doubt but it may be put in execution.</p>

Some of thoſe that haue trodden the firſt path, ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in authoritie do grow proude: and others that haue come by the ſecond I doe imagine to be ignorant, which are very great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as eaſie to bee knowne in others, as hard to be eſpied by thoſe that are poſſeſſed with them. And as to diſeaſes engendred in mens bodies, the remedies muſt bee applyed according to the rules of Phiſicke: the like doe theſe that are of the minde ſtande in neede of.

So alſo may wee ſay, that militarie miſhaps doe ſometimes worke the like effects. For by bringing vpon vs an apparant calamitie, they doe thereby ſerue for an inſtruction to heale the hidden euill that bred the other.

Hereto they adde alſo that his fame is ſo diſperſed among his enemies, that when they knowe him to be in the fielde, they feare him as the Shepheards in <hi>Barbary</hi> doe the mightie Lyon when he commeth out of the woods.

                  <p>By this ſweete harmonie of ſpeech, this man who peraduenture <note place="margin">The effectes of pride enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med through our owne bad nature and the diſcourſes of our frendes &amp; flatterers.</note> before preſumed enough of himſelfe, now coueteth to preſume too much, and ſo to ſeeke nothing but warre and battaile. Yea the moſt modeſt who miſlike flatteries, euen in the reiecting of them, do ſtill ſwallowe downe ſome ſmall portion, wherewith to feede that little vanitie that dwelleth in them. It is not to bee enquired what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes they make in themſelues, what they ſhall doe, or how high they ſhall climbe, but to take theſe for extrauagants.

But for the others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better guided by vertue, their loſſes doe happen after a more valiant ſorte; where theſe ignorant men doe fall into miſhappes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſhame: Now to ſpeake of the eſtate as well of the one as of the other, they that amend, be happie in miſhap: but moſt vnhappie are thoſe that will neuer acknowledge their error, but impute it either to others or to fortune, and ſo continue their pride in the middeſt of their miſerie.

And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture this laſt poynt hath partly bene the occaſion that they haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded Princes that ſuch and ſo many things were requiſite to bring a peece of worke to perfection and worthie them. Wherein they haue not bene altogether vntoward: for through great &amp; long expences the water is come to their mil. I know it beſeemeth great Princes to doe great workes, becauſe they haue great meanes and therefore the ſmall will not content them; but withall they ſhould prize them in the ballance of commoditie, leaſt the deareneſſe of the one hinder the ſetting hand to the other. I ſeeke not herein that <note place="margin">To whom thoſe of ſmale expenſe are profitable.</note> which is ſeemely for a fewe, but that which may bee commodious and profitable to all: Eſpecially for their ſakes who being weake, had neede for their owne fafetie to fortifie themſelues, and yet through pouertie are driuen to ſpend but little. I take that to be a fruitfull peece of worke which is performed quickly, eaſely, and with ſmall coſt, and yet in goodneſſe doth counteruaile an other whereto they cannot attaine without contrary meanes. I meane not in this my treatiſe to comprehend ſuch places as are ſtrong by nature, but only thoſe which may be ſo made by arte.</p>
                  <p>The firſt place that here I will bring to view, ſhall be the <hi>Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell of Antwerpe,</hi> wherein wee may ſay that nothing hath bene <note place="margin">Fortereſſe which haue ſo much.</note>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:8683:116"/>
forgotten, either in wealth, diligence, inuention or plentie of ſtuffe: ſo as in all <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> a goodlier peece of worke for fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath no man ſeene. But on the other ſide if wee conſider that the building thereof coſt 1400000. Florins, and yet, had it bene aſſaulted, would not peraduenture haue held out much better then <hi>Oudenarde</hi> or <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> which were fortified but with earth, it will make men ſomewhat curious to examine theſe matters more exactly. Eſpecially ſmall Potentates and little townes are to looke very néerely hereto: for if they ſhould meaſure their defence by the ell of theſe great Princes, they ſhould bee peraduenture empouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, yea vtterly ouerthrowne before they could bee halfe fotified. The <hi>Citadell of Mets</hi> coſt aboue a million of Franks, and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that that of <hi>Turin</hi> drewe néere to 300000. Crownes. Which I ſpeake not as miſliking that theſe great Princes ſhould employ ſo much vpon theſe ſmall Caſtles: for they waſt much more vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably: but only to the ende to let men ſee that for the fortifying of ſuch a towne as <hi>Malines</hi> or <hi>Orleance,</hi> which in greatneſſe are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, after that order the charge would amount vnto aboue fiue millions of Florens: alſo that for the furniſhing of money they ſhould bee driuen either to ſell one of their Eſtates or make peace for a hundred yeeres with their neighbours, that they might worke at leiſure.</p>
                  <p>Some man may ſay, it is but a ſmall matter for the Kings, who <note place="margin">Againſt thoſe that like of ſuch expenſes.</note> in the ciuill warres of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> haue each of them ſpent aboue 70. millions of golde. But I will to the contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude by the ſame reaſon: for hauing waſted ſuch innumerable ſummes, a little will be found to be a great deale. If we ſhall looke all <hi>France</hi> ouer, I thinke wee ſhall ſcarcely finde (except a fewe Caſtles) any towne halfe finiſhed after the engeniors rules. Some doe beare themſelues herein like vnto certaine Brides, who being perſwaded that a gowne of cloath of golde will make them more beautifull then one of taffatie; doe thereby force their huſbands to conſent that half their dowrie be conſumed in beautifull ornaments for their mariages: but afterward they haue ſower ſauce to their ſweete meate, as being driuen to a long pennance for their ſumpte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vanitie. It were much more profitable for both to know what were méete, and to goe no farther. When I compare the townes that were beſieged in the time of <hi>King Frances</hi> &amp; his ſonne <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> with thoſe that haue bene aſſaulted in our ciuill warres, I am forced to confeſſe that theſe laſt haue bene better defended, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:8683:116"/>
they haue bene aſſayled with greater arte, and yet moſt of them were neuer furniſhed with any of theſe ſtately fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations: which ſheweth that ſo many great expences are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, ſith they bring foorth no better fruite then thoſe that are leſſe.</p>
                  <p>The ingeniours will ſay that notwithſtanding men fortifie but <note place="margin">How to helpe our ſelues with the Ingeniors deuiſes, and yet auoide exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue expenſes.</note> with earth without any of their ſupporters of Stone or Bricke, (which are no leſſe beautifull then neceſſarie) yet ſtill they followe their precepts. Wherto I aunſwer that in many things men may helpe themſelues therewith: howbeit they are rather to ſticke to newe experiences which haue taught very good kindes of fitting and defending themſelues. The firſt is the ſame that I haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die mentioned, namely fortification with earth: which coſt tenne times leſſe then great Maſondrie, and is neuer a whit worſe. For proofe hereof I will alleadge the towne of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> which in two yeeres was finiſhed and furniſhed with Rauelins, ditches &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarpes, (although it be of as great circuite as <hi>Paris</hi> within the walles) and coſt not aboue 300000. Florins: But if the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> ſhould haue made this fortification according to the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten rules, he muſt haue ſpent aboue ſixe millions and twentie yeres at the leaſt. In diuers places the townes haue bene taken, before they haue bene a quarter fortified after theſe great platformes. The ſecond thing which experience hath made many to allowe of, is to loſen the <hi>Baſtions</hi> from the <hi>Courtines,</hi> yea and to carie them without the ditch. For although they be not defended with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie from any lowe Caſemates, yet doe the Harquebuzery ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſhield them from the Curtines which is a continuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance that cannot bee taken away, where the flankes of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions may bee pearced or broken when the ſhoulders are weake. Alſo if one of thoſe rarelines that I ſpeake of ſhould chaunce to bée taken, yet is not the place therefore ſo loſt, but that the enemie may very well be put backe, where contrariwiſe it is a neceſſarie conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to thoſe that haue ioyned them to the Rampiers. The third is the vſe of intrenching, which is a marueilous profitable remedie, though ſmally practiſed in times paſt, but in our ciuill warres, men haue learned to vſe it very well. Though they bee weake and but ill made, yet doe they preſerue from being forced on a ſudden, and procure ſome reaſonable compoſition. But if they be large and well made, either they wholy preſerue or at the leaſt doe giue a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths reſpite (which is a ſoueraigne purchaſe to the beſieged, when
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:8683:117"/>
the enemie muſt winne it by little and little) during which time they may light vppon ſome fauourable accident for themſelues. Hereto will I adde one ſleight which practiſe hath taught, namely, to ſtriue for a drie ditch after the Counterſcarpe is wonne, and ſo to defend a Rampier a fewe daies, though the enemie be lodged in the Parapet. For with ſundrie pollicies haue men learned to fight each with other, ſome more, ſome leſſe: as hath bene ſeene in diuers Sieges both in the <hi>Lowe countries</hi> and in <hi>France.</hi> All which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions doe conſiſt as much in remouing the earth, as in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manuall defence.</p>
                  <p>Now will I ſhewe how I would the place which I propound <note place="margin">An aduiſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the meanes to fortifie with ſmale coſt.</note> ſhould be prouided for, preſuppoſing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſituation to be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plaine as are the ſituatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of moſt of the townes in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Firſt I would not haue the Rampier raiſed too high: For ſuch as are ſo vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable high, as they are in moſt places about <hi>Bruxelles, Tournay, Orleance,</hi> and <hi>Rochell,</hi> are rather Mountaines then Rampiers, and bee within as I thinke thirtie foote high. For herein they be hurtfull, that being wonne, there is no more meanes to defende, becauſe the defendants cannot entrench behinde to any purpoſe, when their trench ſhall bée ſo ouer awed. As for the ditch, I would wiſh it to bée full of water if it might bée, ſo to eſchue ſurprizes, as alſo that it is more troubleſome to the aſſailant then the drye. Counterſcarpes doe after a ſorte ſerue, and the couert way to them ſhould bée large.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe I would thinke an other pathe to be profitable, which ſhould be behinde or vnder the firſt, being ſixe foote broade and as many high: Which ſhould ſerue to the ende that when the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarpe chaunced to bee wonne by vyolence (as was that of <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> where all the Souldiers were drowned and ſlaine) the defendants might ſaue themſelues. As for the Rauelins they would be fitly placed without the ditch, and made ſo large that they may beare a good entrenching. For ſo ſhall the enemie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he haue wonne the poynt, haue a fortnights worke. But the inner ditch, if it were poſſible, ſhould be drye, to the ende the Souldiers might in the beginning of the Siege bee kept there for iſſues: which I thinke to bée neceſſarie for the beſieged, as well to the encreaſe of their courages, as in reſpect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great hurts which the enemie ſhall thereby receiue. For theſe are meetly ſafe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes for a cunning Captaine, and will amaze the aſſailants when they ſhall finde themſelues aſſailed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:8683:117"/>
Whoſoeuer vndertaketh to aſſault ſuch a place, muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie <note place="margin">The way how to deſcend a place that is beſieged.</note> begin with the Rauelin, which is a moſt aſſured warning that he will beate the Courtine on that ſide. Wherefore omitting all other matter they muſt fall to entrenching, whereby in time they may make as it were a newe towne, in caſe they haue people enow and a ſkilfull Ingeniour.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe that in a place where there are Souldiers a Rauelin ſhould hold out one month at the leaſt, yea euen againſt the <hi>Prince of Parma,</hi> who is the ſkilfulleſt aſſaulter of townes that I know. The rampier and paſſage of a ditch full of water will be as long: and the inner trench, being almoſt equall with the heigth of the rampier that is beaten downe may be kept as long or longer, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided alwaies, that it be made 60. or 80. foote from the Courtine. Now I take this at the worſt: for there bee ſuch weake aſſailants of Houlds, as ſhall labour two moneths about the winning of a Raueline. There are that thinke it an eaſie matter to keepe them from paſſing the ditch, but for my parte I thinke it harde, for they will enter either by night or day. Thus when a frontier towne ſhal haue ſtopped a mightie armie ſo long as I haue ſayd, it ſhall haue quit it ſelfe well (for there bee fewe townes inpregnable) and the Prince that may haue loſt it ſhall haue this comfort: That as the fencing of it had coſt him little, ſo his enemie ſhall haue ſpent much time, many men, and money enough in the winning of it.</p>
                  <p>Some Ingeniour may ſay that water vndermindeth the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations <note place="margin">Againſt ſuch as thinck wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to rampi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of earth.</note> of a Rampier, and that from tenne yeeres to tenne yeeres they runne out: which they do not if they be walled within. It is ſo indeede where the water is a running water: but the repairing coſt little, as alſo doe the props that beare vp nothing but earth. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, I ſay that a man may fortifie a whole ſmall towne with earth with the charges of one encloſure to a Baſtion made of bricke or ſtone with the countermynes thereof. This maner do I here alow for an other reſpect: which is, that Potentates &amp; Commonwelths are better able to prouide for the inward fortifications, which muſt accompanie the outward, &amp; do conſiſt in al kinds of neceſſarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion that want in many townes, though not in whole, yet in parte. And as many are loſt through this default as for lack of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. They may likewiſe ſpare great ſommes, which are ſpent in theſe great workes, and with the ſame maintaine a ſufficient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, through want whereof the ſtrongeſt places are taken, as hath bene ſeene in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Many thinges more may bee obiected

to beate downe this our Bulwarke, which is much more profitable to the weake then beautifull to the mightie Monarkes.

I will forbeare to ſpeake of things happened within theſe fifty yeres in reſpect of ſo many people yet liuing, which may haue conſidered thereof: but of foure ſcore yeres ago <hi>Phillip Commines &amp; Fran.

It cannot be denied but ours haue danced at the feaſt among others, and peraduenture oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: but it hath likewiſe ſoone after mourned for it as wel as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt, as hauing reaped no other commoditie of the greate warres of <hi>Charles the eight and Lewes the twelfth</hi> (which neuertheleſſe were not quite deuoide of all grounds of iuſtice) but waſt of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and conſumption of men. Which might admoniſh all Princes to undertake none but ſuch as be neceſſarie, &amp; vtterly to reiect thoſe that containe no neceſſitie.</p>
               <p>I knowe they haue a wonderfull quick deſire to increaſe, which <note place="margin">Whar conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations ought to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of princes.</note> neuertheles they maye moderate by a repreſentation of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes and difficulties of warres, were it not that they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſtrengthned and vnderpropped with the counſayle of the young, together with cuſtome: which not onely maintaineth it in force, but alſo dooth greatly increaſe it. For aſſuredlie the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier that a Prince is, the more is hee pricked forwarde with ſuch ſtings, as leaue him but ſmall reſt vntill that hee hath chaunged other mennes mindes: whereby he entangleth himſelfe in many cares and wantes, which he might well inough forbeare. Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it thoſe men are happie who in the middeſt of ſuch diſordered broiles, falſe perſwaſions, and wicked cuſtomes, doe guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by wiſdome and diſcretion: for ordinarilie they paſſe on the waie without ſtumbling and attaine to ſuch endes as breede their contentation. Our good King <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſeconde hauing practiſed and tried the vanitié of couetouſneſſe and warres,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:8683:122"/>
was determined to paſſe ouer the reſt of his daies in tranquilitie, and content himſelfe with that mightineſſe that to him remained; which was not ſmall, but it pleaſed God to call him. And although all things haue ſince greatly decayed throughout this Realme, yet I thinke our king hath cauſe enough (preſeruing and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that which yet remaineth) to account himſelfe mightie &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, though he neuer ſeeke with yron, fire, and bloud, the forced do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer his neighbours.</p>
               <p>By this propoſition I bring the ambitious into the liſtes, who <note place="margin">Anſwer to the obiections of ambitions Counſailers.</note> ſaie, <hi>That the incloſing of our kings heartes within the accuſtomed bounds, is the waie to quaile their courages, and to depriue them of all trophees and conqueſts, the goodlie inheritances wherein theyr aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours meant they ſhould participate:</hi> likewiſe <hi>That it is vnpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when they conſider the dominions of Charlemagne, which as all good hiſtories doo teſtifie, ſtretched into Italie, Germanie, France, che lowe Countries, &amp; Spaine, euen to the riuer Ebro, but they muſt needs bluſh for ſhame, thinking how themſelues lurke at home &amp; do nothing.</hi> Trulie theſe be high wordes, which in my opinion, doe reſemble the furious Northerne windes that ſtirre vp the greate tempeſts: for by theyr often blowing in kings eares, they prouoke their mindes, whereof doe enſue the torments of warres which drowne ſo many people. If they could weigh the diſſimilitude between old and new vertue, they would bee more ſtayed: For as ſayth <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarke</hi> in his ſmall workes, it is as much follie to applie the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roycall deedes of thoſe that are paſt, vnto men preſent, as to put vpon the head &amp; feete of children of ſixe yeres of age their grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hats and ſhooes. But men ought to propound things conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to that age wherein a man liueth, ſo long as they bee iuſt and honeſt. We Frenchmen ſhould thinke that <hi>France</hi> is paſt her grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt grouth, and that wee are come to the time of her declination, wherein wee ſhall doe much if wee can but keepe her well, which we ſhoulde endeauour to performe, and not to feede vppon her paſſed glorie and mightineſſe, becauſe we are deſtitute of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power, occaſion, and good happe that lead our aunceſtours thereto.</p>
               <p>Some there are that thinke that a Prince cannot bee tearmed <note place="margin">Aunſwere to an other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the mightineſſe of Prinſes.</note> mightie or great, vnleſſe hee ioyne newe Prouinces to his eſtate, and make his neighbours to feare and ſtand in awe of him, through his weapons, which doe incourage him to enterpriſe and threaten greate thinges, wherein they followe the common iudgement, which as ſayth <hi>Plutarke</hi> alſo, doe admire the Thunder and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:8683:122"/>
lightning, and make ſmall account of the ſweete <hi>Zephirus:</hi> for they making no reckning but of whatſoeuer procedeth of force do leaue behinde them any thing proceeding of iuſtice, notwithſtanding the one be to be preferred before the other. Many Emperours &amp; Kings there haue bene, who haue indeauoured to purchaſe fame through their conqueſts, and yet thoſe that had bene content to take paines to bee good, and ſo to make their people, and well to rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne them, haue purchaſed another greatnes, if we iudge vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no leſſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the former, ſeeing it alwais profiteth, where the other doth ordinerilie hurt. Yet doe I not meane that a Prince ſhoulde tread armour vnder his feete, or contemne it, for ſo ſhoulde hee but giue himſelfe to be a praie: but that he ſhould vſe it onely to keepe himſelfe from taking of harme, and not to doe hurt to others.</p>

               <p>And ſith this ſpeech forceth mee to laie open our wares, I ſaie that of ſo many our battailes and combats, we haue yet remaining ſixe braue Princes, as well of the bloud royall as others, who haue many times commanded whole armies, of whome ſome haue giuen great ouerthrowes, and both defended &amp; taken townes of account. Next vnto them ſhal come our Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> who haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ben imployed, among whom the Lords of <hi>Montmorency</hi> &amp; <hi>Biron</hi> may be commended for the two beſt experienced Captains that we haue. Twentie other good Captaines of the men of armes may we finde, who hauing ſeene the warres of <hi>Henrie the ſecond</hi> doe deſerue to leade an auantgard. How many other Lordes and Captains be there, who hauing ſeene but the ciuil wars, or part of them, haue diuerſly teſtified their valiancy and good conduct. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from among our great numbers of Captaines of footmen, I ſuppoſe we may well chooſe halfe a dozen good and worthie Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels. Hereby it appeareth that we are not cleane deſtitute of men of command, which is the principall part of our warfare. I wil not ſpeake of the reſt of our nobilitie and ſoldiours: for leade them well and they will ſhew valour ſufficient, neither can anie warre weare <note place="margin">What meanes the King hath to defende him ſelfe againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prince his neyghbour that liſt to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile him.</note> away either the one or the other.</p>
               <p>If our king ſhould perceiue anie neighbour readie to plaie with his frontiers, I thinke he might eaſily make an armie of 60. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of men of armes, twentie Cornets of light horſe, and fiue companies of harquebuziers on horſebacke, to whom he might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Sith therefore he is yet able to bring ſuch a power into the field, there is no wiſe man that will thinke him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to play banquerout (as ſome men doe make account) but rather <note place="margin">Of the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of order in France.</note> to be a moſt mightie Prince.</p>
               <p>It reſteth that we ſpeake of order which in many other matters is verie diſordered among vs. But the kings owne hand muſt bee the true meane to reſtore it, which can as well do that as handle the ſword: But he muſt haue the aſſiſtance of time and peace, without the which it is vnpoſſible hee ſhoulde attaine thereto: for adding to them both his owne diligence and good example, the worke will be performed: in ſuch wiſe that where now it is called <hi>France decai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> it ſhall be tearmed <hi>France reſtored.</hi> I would extend my ſpeech farther, were it not that I remember I may be accuſed of cogging with ſtrangers, and flattering my owne nation. Rather woulde I wiſh the firſt to knowe that as ſtronge bodies doe through theyr owne riot ouerthrowe themſelues: ſo likewiſe by a certaine hidden power in them they riſe againe, examples whereof we haue enow.

in his briefe Chronicle of the world faithfully corrected out of al hiſtories, ſayth the Turkes to be deſcended out of the ſtraightes of the mount <hi>Caucaſus.</hi> And that (as ſome reporte) they diſpearſed themſelues out of the North into ſome ſmall corners of <hi>Aſia</hi> about two hundred yeres before the comming of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned almoſt vnknowen vnto the time of the the Emperour <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclius,</hi> who raigned in the yere 612. Then <hi>Oriſmada</hi> king of the <hi>Perſians</hi> finding himſelfe aſſayled by the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> called to them for ſuccour whome they aſſiſted. But after his death ſeeing the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razens</hi> had ſeaſed vpon the Realme, the beautie and fruitfulnes of the land ſo allured them, that they ſtayed about the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſea, in that place which in olde time was called <hi>Hircanie,</hi> and finallie ſo compounded with the <hi>Caliph of Babylon;</hi> that he ſuffered them to poſſeſſe and till the land where they had ſtayed.

Thus did they eſtabliſh theyr domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in both the <hi>Armenies,</hi> whereto they adioyned <hi>Capadocia, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacia,</hi> and <hi>Bithinia,</hi> which by little and little they conquered, and this was about the yere of Chriſt 1050.

But in all ſuch leagues as wee make with theſe deſtroiers and ſcourges of the worlde, in whom <hi>treaſon, impietie, vniuſtice and crueltie,</hi> haue their continuall habitation, there is alwayes <hi>errour,</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if we exceede certaine bounds preſcribed by reaſon, becauſe it is in no caſe lawfull to confederate with them, except for matter of ſmall importance, and ſuch as bindeth not the hearts with any ſtrict amitie, neither the perſons in anie great bond. For what ſtedfaſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie <note place="margin">What treaty may be made with Turkes: alſo what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ſuch treaties and true alliance with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſtedfaſt conſederaties with tirants.</note> can there be with thoſe whoſe continuall imaginations tend onely to ſubdue you to vngodly bondage, &amp; ſo to deſtroy you. Wee cannot neuertheleſſe here inferre that no man may enter anie trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with them, becauſe ſomtime neceſſitie induceth vs to grow ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with the moſt diuelliſh enimies that we can imagine: as to <hi>craue truce or peace, to agree controuerſies for Lordſhips or territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> to <hi>demand amends for iniuries,</hi> and <hi>to deale for trafick &amp; aſſurance for merchants.</hi> In theſe caſes it is lawfull to deale and &amp; treate with theſe tyrants. Who ſo therefore would compare theſe agreements with thoſe true and lawfull leagues which are vſually made betweene Princes, to the ende each to helpe other againſt all that ſeeke their trouble, ſhall ſee a wonderful difference betwéen them. For theſe are grounded vpon equitie, and tend to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and maintenance of ciuill amitie betweene them, whereas Princes do vſe the other agreements vppon neceſſitie ſomewhat to bridle their rage, whereof doe grow ſome aſſurance to their ſubiects and their affaires.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Wallachians, Moldacians, Tranſiluanians and Sclauons,</hi> haue bene forced to proceede farther, as to ſubmit themſelues to the Turkes, to the ende to eſchue their furious cruelty, for want of meanes of defence, and of them wee ought to take compaſſion. Some would peraduenture think that this proud nation would be loth to enter amitie with the <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> But the contrarie is moſt true: For albeit they be barbarous, yet doe they herein imitate the auncient pollicie of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> who vnder coulour of confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies ſet foote in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Gaule,</hi> which afterwarde they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.</p>
               <p>The lyke would theſe doe if they might: but at the leaſt in their haunting among Chriſtians, they diſcouer our affaires, diligently conſidering our forces and meanes, which afterward doe the more kindle their deſire to enterpriſe againſt vs, neither doe our men through their conuerſation among them, reape any other fruit than

apprentiſhip of moſt wicked cuſtomes which doe infect particular perſons with corruption and entangle the mindes of thoſe whome they gouerne with tyrannous precepts.</p>
               <p>I will yet alleadge other of the moſt notable examples of ſuch as <note place="margin">Other latter examples of the danger that is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federaties and truſt to Turkes</note> haue abuſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues &amp; found inconuenience in repoſing too much confidence in Turkiſh infidelitie. One ſhall bee of the laſt king of <hi>Hungarie</hi> named <hi>Iohn,</hi> whome the <hi>Hungarians</hi> choſe after that <hi>Lewes</hi> was ſlaine in battaile againſt the Turkes. This king ſoone after his election did <hi>Ferdinand</hi> expulſe vnder ſome pretended title to the Realme: which forced him to haue recourſe &amp; to put himſelfe into the protection of <hi>Sultan Soliman,</hi> who thereby had a good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: For he waited only how through the meanes of the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to get acceſſe into thoſe places where he ſought to eſtabliſh his greatneſſe. Thus hauing for the time reſtored him into his dignity, and beaten <hi>Ferdinandes</hi> men, he kept not his promiſe long: for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the deceaſe of <hi>Iohn</hi> he diſpoſſeſſed the Queene his widow &amp; his orphane, who had craued his helpe againſt <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged them: and euer ſince haue the moſt part of <hi>Hungarie</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the hands of the Turkes. In this their deede the grieuous iniuries offred by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> aforenamed, may to ſome ſeeme to excuſe their ſubmiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <hi>Soliman:</hi> howbeit they were not free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blame, in that for their owne particular intereſt they were the cauſe on that ſide to aduance the deſtruction of the Chriſtians, peraduenture 30. yeres ſooner tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it would haue happened, beſides that, they ought rather to haue ſummoned the Chriſtian princes to take order for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies, or elſe to haue growen to compoſition with <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</hi>

Of whom <hi>Alphons king of Naples</hi> is one, who fearing the power of <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. king of <hi>France,</hi> did after the imitation of <hi>Pope Alexander</hi> the 6. who before had done the like, ſent his Embaſſadors to <hi>Baiazet</hi> to craue helpe.

Is it not as much as if a man ſhould go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the woods to hier theeues to murther his kinſeman or friend in his owne houſe, for ſome debate riſen betweene them? Either to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the windowe to the wolfe, and ſo to bring him into the flock to deuour the ſheepe? Thoſe that were at the firſt war in <hi>Hungarie,</hi> when <hi>Soliman</hi> came in perſon, doe affirme that in that one onelie voyage there were aboue 200000. perſons of that onely Realme, either ſlaine or caried awaie captiue, which violences together with innumerable other more haue bene ſuch paſtimes as theſe horrible monſters haue within theſe two hundred yeeres taken, to our coſts. Who is he that reading or hearing of the cruelties, villanies, &amp; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the poore Chriſtians indured at the taking of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> but will euen faint for ſorrow and pittie: In this ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke neither the greatneſſe, nobilitie, and affabilitie, neither the teares nor lamentations of the olde, yong, women, or children could any whit mitigate their crueltie, vntill that hauing glutted theyr deſires and reuenges with the bloud, riches, &amp; beautie of the youth of each kinde, they graunted ſome ſmall releaſe to thoſe miſerable perſons that remayned of that furie, who had ben farre more happy to haue bene ſwallowed vp among the reſt.</p>
               <p>I could heere adde ſundrie other deeds wherewith to deſcribe the fierceneſſe of this nation, but it ſhall not greatly neede, becauſe wee <note place="margin">The originall and occaſion of the alliance of the French Kinges with the Turkes.</note> are to beleeue theyr proceedings to haue bene almoſt alwaies alike, as if theyr onely drift tended to tread all mankinde vnder their feet. Our neighbours alwayes haue and ſtill doe thinke it wonderfull ſtrange how ſuch learned wiſe men as haue continually floriſhed in <hi>France,</hi> could counſayle our kings to enter league with theſe, yea, and ſo long to perſeuere therein, conſidering how infortunate ſuch confederacies haue bene. Some auncient perſons haue in this ſort reported the cauſe. That king <hi>Frances</hi> the firſt ſeeing himſelfe ſtil beſet with the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> a mightie Prince, <hi>Henrie</hi> king of <hi>England,</hi> and diuerſe other enimies, who oft brought his ſtate in to daunger, was for his owne ſaferie counſailed to confederate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with <hi>Sultan Seliman,</hi> to the end when they ſhould moleſt him, to oppoſe agaynſt them ſo mightie an enimie. And this treatie was concluded about the yeere 1535. by vertue whereof wee haue often times had ſuccour from the Turkes, which haue greatly hindered thoſe that troubled <hi>France,</hi> and without the which it muſt needes haue indured much more through the ambition of them that ought
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:8683:128"/>
not to haue brought our Kings into neceſſitie to employe ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble armies. All theſe accuſations and iuſtifications haue moued me to peruſe ſome hiſtories, to the ende to ſee what profite or hurt wee haue reaped by their ſuccour.</p>
               <p>I haue noted three or fower armies by Sea brought into <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What ſeruice the Turkes haue done to France.</note> at the purſuite, as they ſay, of the <hi>French men</hi> vnder the conduct of <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> and other Admiralles, who haue bred great terror. The moſt notable of al their exployts, in my opinion, was the taking of <hi>Boniface in Corſe.</hi> But I haue laboured to learne of diuers auncient Captaines and other ſkilfull perſons both <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spanyards,</hi> what their nations either thought or ſayd of theſe <hi>Turkiſh</hi> tempeſtes: who all reported vnto me that theſe barbarous people wrought lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table deſolations, as hauing burned, ſacked, yea and led into perpetuall bondage a merueilous number of poore <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> for the moſt part, which was worſe, were forced to renounce <hi>Chriſtianitie</hi> and to embrace the falſe doctrine of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> a moſt lamentable deſtruction truely of ſo many ſoules fallen into ſuch horrible gulfes of perdition! Neither is it almoſt to bee imagined how grieuouſly theſe miſchiefes haue moued all countrie people both to ſpeake and write in the reproach of the <hi>French</hi> nation. <hi>What then might,</hi> ſayd they, <hi>the kindred and friends of thoſe that were led into this miſerable bondage doe?</hi> One loſt his father and mother: an other his wife and children: this man his brother, that man his coſen. It is very likely that their iuſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe haue wreſted from them infinite complaints, teares and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, which haue peraduenture knocked at heauen gates. This confederacie ſeemeth to haue bene the cauſe of the deminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the glorie of ſo floriſhing a Realme as <hi>France:</hi> for euen at the death of <hi>King Henry</hi> the ſecond it was fallen from a great parte of that greatneſſe which fortie yeeres before it did enioye. And although other cauſes might ſet forward this declination, yet doe many thinke this to haue bene none of the leaſt. <hi>Yea,</hi> ſay they, <hi>if</hi>

                  <hi>we ſhould compare the commoditie reaped by all this Turkiſh ſuccour with the onely tainting of the French good name among all nations in Europe, we muſt of force confeſſe that the reproach doth farre exceede the profite. For what is the winning of two or three townes to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of ſo many people for actions ſo vniuerſally condemned? Yea our ſelues can yet testifie that at the concluding of the peace betweene the two Kings of France and Spayne Anno 1559. the common ſpeech of Germany, Italie and Spayne was that one of the chiefeſt cauſes of our

miſfortunes proceeded of confederating with the Turkes, &amp; bringing in and fauouring them to the hurt of the Christians.</hi> To whome I aunſwered: That they did too ſharply taunt thoſe things which in ſome reſpects might be borne with, neither were ſo vnlawfull but that vpon neceſſitie they might bee vſed: likewiſe that the offence was in him that forced others for their ſafegard to haue recourſe to ſuch meanes. But they replyed: <hi>That it is one thing to confederate with a Christian Prince though vniuſt and ambitious, and an other with theſe barbarous people which are the instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Gods wrath. Alſo that thoſe which ſeeke to excuſe theſe errors, ought to ſhew what wiſedome there is in backing our ſelues with the ſuccour of ſuch as ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh the Princes fame and bring him into reproach. Moreouer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not mere blindnes to paſſe the ſame way wherin we ſee euery man encurre ſhipwracke? Finally, that their opinion was, that no wiſe man endued with any conſcience could much gainſay ſo euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a truth, but would rather yeeld and grannt not onely to condemne that which was ſo vnlawfull, but alſo to abstaine from perſeuering therein.</hi> Theſe in brief were the reaſons that they propounded, which alſo I could not finde to be much impertinent. Neuertheleſſe, for my better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfying, I thought good to trye the opinions of ſome Deuines which came to viſite me, whether Chriſtian integritie were empai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſuch confederaties. To this queſtion they aunſwered: that <hi>Daniel in his prophetie, ſpeaking of the 4. Monarchies which ſhould</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">How farre ſuch confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raties doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religion.</note>

That the eyes ſignified a law craftely inuented, &amp; the mouth blaſphemy againſt God, alſo that this power ſhould fight againſt the Saincts and haue great victories. This did they affirme to ſignifie the doctrine of Mahumet houlden firſt by the Sarazens, and then by the Turkes. That if we liſt well to conſider the Turkiſh king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, wee ſhould finde it to be a terrible tyrannie, whoſe ſubiects were wonderfully enthralled: their warres deſtitute of all good foundation: their politique gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t being wel examined to be but a bare name: their Eccleſiaſtical regiment to be none: but in liew thereof wee ſhould ſee a wicked prophaning of the name and ſeruice of the true God: their houſehold affayres ſubuerted with Poligamy &amp; other diſorders which diſſolued all humaine ſocietie. And as for their trecherie and crueltie the hiſtories together with experience &amp; the matters afore alleadged

doe yeeld ſufficient teſtimonie to make vs to beleeue that prophetie to belong to them, as being therein ſo figured as they are.</hi>

               <p>

                  <hi>how a Chriſtian Prince can confederate or make any ſtedfaſt league with ſuch barbarous nations as are as it were marked and appoynted to be the ſcourges to Chriſtians? For as we thinke, they can hardly be vſed without offence to pietie. In olde tyme God expreſſely forbad the Iewes to enter amitie with the Canaanites or Amorites, people whom for their abominable vice he did abhorre. Neither were the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon amiſſe in ſetting the Turkes downe for the one, and our ſelues for the other: whereof it muſt of neceſſitie followe, that the ſame defence ought to ſtand vs in ſtead of a lawe to reſtraine vs, leaſt we pollute our ſelues in their abominations.</hi> Then did I tell them, that I much meruailed how ſo many <hi>Cardinalles, Biſhoppes and Doctors</hi> endued with great learning, of whome <hi>France</hi> had no want, could brooke this league, or made no meanes to breake it. Hereto their aunſwer was: that <hi>many tymes Princes made the gownes to yeeld to the ſword, and the counſaile of the Clergie to the neceſſitie of the ſtate.</hi> And ſo wee brake off our conference: which hauing ſince well conſidered, hath forced me to ſay: That theſe barbarous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are the ſame againſt whome the <hi>Pope</hi> ought to turne his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications, and all Chriſtian Potentates their wrath and weapons, rather then againſt them ſelues or their Subiects, to whome very raſhly they impute Hereſie, when they ſhould haue in much greater abomination all <hi>Turkiſh infidelitie.</hi> Againſt thoſe ſhould they drawe their Swordes, not to conuert them (for the Goſpell taketh no roote in mens mindes, but by preaching and holineſſe of life) but to repreſſe their crueltie and tyrannie: and theſe warres would bee as neceſſarie as our domeſticall bee vnneceſſarie.</p>
               <p>But there are ſome, who ſeeing the <hi>Turkes</hi> proſperitie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo long, and to encreaſe rather then deminiſh, are as it were <note place="margin">Anſwer to an obiection grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Turkes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie.</note> confounded in themſelues, and cannot thinke their dominion to bée ſo deteſtable, conſidering that God powreth not his wrath vpon them, but rather his fauour. I doubt not but ſuch as want inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Gods prouidence, are ſometimes, when they enter into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe hereof, euen ſhaken: but they ought to bee aſſured that this power can haue no perpetual continuance, which hath her bounds, as had the <hi>Saraze<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> that is ended, together with their name, ſo that theſe many yeeres we haue heard no newes thereof.</p>

Theſe rods doth the Lord entertaine to the ende only to puniſh and chaſtiſe thoſe who bearing the glorious title of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> doe neuertheleſſe through their iniquities diſhonor him, neither neede we elſewhere ſeeke the cauſe of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> proſperitie then in our owne ſinnes, the continuance whereof doe thereto miniſter ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and ſtrength: where contrariwiſe our amendment would bée an occaſion that the Lord ſhould pull it downe. I would wiſh all ſuch as are familier with Princes, often to put them in minde that lawfull Monarchies, which ought to be ſupported with <hi>Pietie</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> cannot bee preſerued by any meanes repugnant to theſe vertues, ſo to reſolue them the more, not to ſeeke any profite in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vtterly ſeperate from honeſtie.</p>
               <p>I knowe there may be ſome that will ſay that <hi>France</hi> is now ſo <note place="margin">Aunſwer to thoſe that thinke it no time now for the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to breake their league with the Turkes.</note> weake and brought ſo low, that it were not meete it ſhould for ſake thoſe leagues which ſeeme to retaine her enemies in any feare, who would peraduenture be eaſely enduced to ſet vpon her ſo ſoone as the proppe, which is to them a terror, ſhall be taken away. Firſt the <hi>Germaines</hi> would redemaund the imperiall townes: Then the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> who hath ſundrie both olde and new quarels, would alleadge ſome one or other: and it is to bee doubted but ſuch migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie enémies would deale hardly with her. Indeede this requireth conſideration. But the <hi>Germaines</hi> will aunſwer: That their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not ſo hot to entangle the Empire in ſo great a warre which they would not wiſh to bee mightier then it is, leaſt it ſhould gripe them as did the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Duke of Saxony and the Lantgraue.</hi> Neither would they aduance the ruine of <hi>France,</hi> which they knowe to bee a good counterpaize for the inner ſide of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> and a ſtrong ſhield for the outer ſide. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> do ſay that the long peace betweene their <hi>King &amp; France,</hi> together with his affayres in the <hi>Low countries,</hi> doe ſufficiently declare that he intendeth not to moleſt her with warres: For it is enough for him that ſhe daily decayeth through her owne ciuill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions: whereby now he no whit feareth her power, which afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time hath bene a terror vnto him. So as it were rather to be belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that if the Princes her neighbours might ſee <hi>France</hi> for an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall benefite, to giue ouer their league with the <hi>Turkes,</hi> they would like very well of ſo commendable a worke which they haue long deſired.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, I referre my ſelfe to the matter as it is, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <note place="margin">The concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</note> doe ſay, that our Kings in olde time ſhewed forth their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

The conſideration of the greatneſſe of this perrill which is ſo neere might bee ſufficient to terrifie, and waken eſpecially thoſe that are in chiefeſt dignitie, to ſtraine themſelues to prouide for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon preſeruation. For the fire by little &amp; little taketh hold, &amp; hath alreadie conſumed the ſuburbes of Chriſtendome, namely <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> with all the great coaſtes of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> ſea, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called <hi>Sclauonia:</hi> So as by ſea wee haue theſe barbarous people at the mouthes of our hauens, &amp; vpon the land in our gates. Certaine it is that had it not bene for the famous victorie of <hi>Don Iohn of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrich,</hi> a moſt valiant and noble Prince, together with the warre of <hi>Wallachie,</hi> wherein died 50000. <hi>Turkes,</hi> &amp; now their laſt with the <hi>Perſian,</hi> which hath coſt them very deere, we ſhould haue felt their forces. Al which loſſes notwithſtanding, yet do they hold the Ile of <hi>Ciprus</hi> as a glorious monument of their tryumph, hauing withall quite raſed to the very foundations the proud fortereſſe of <hi>Goletta in Affrick.</hi> Herein do we ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as they haue loſt men, they are able for euery one get 4. &amp; where we haue loſt land, by our vſuall procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings it is almoſt vnpoſſible to recouer it out of their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds.

enemies to the name of Chriſt: alſo that by continuall warre and all ſortes of crueltie they ſhall endeuour to roote it out, wherwith as yet their effects haue euermore very well concurred: which courſe we are to beleeue they will ſtil continue. I haue heard of ſome that haue haunted among them, that if their Emperours ſhould but a while ſurceaſe their inuaſions againſt the Chriſtians, they ſhould encurre much reproach among their Prieſtes and men of warre, who perſwade themſelues that the ſword of <hi>Mahumet</hi> muſt bring al the world into ſubiection to their Lord. Theſe follies doe ſo puffe them vp and encourage them, that they ambitiouſly couet and embrace as much as euer did <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may bee alleadged that they ſuffer the Chriſtians to liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">why they ſuffer Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</note> their dominions, which is true: But no otherwiſe then we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Oxen and Sheepe to liue in our fieldes, for the profite that we reape by them. Neither make they any other accompt of them then as of bruit beaſtes, and ſo doe vſe them euen in their moſt vile ſeruice, whereto they dare not gainſay: for had they bene willing to diſenhabite the land, long ſince had it bene deſert. But they are not ſo vnaduiſed as to doe that: albeit a valiant minde would preferre death before the calamities and reproaches which they make them to endure. This might be vnto vs a goodly portraiture, ſtill to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, to the end the horror of ſo many cruelties might encreaſe our care, and watching for feare leaſt we fall into the ſame eſtate: For our own daunger conioyned with the compaſſion which we ought to take of their miſeries, will haue the greater power to induce vs to ſeeke all conuenient remedies.</p>
               <p>All this throughly conſidered, there is no fitter way then to v<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nite <note place="margin">The meanes to ſuppreſſe the Turkes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie alſo the cauſe why it is propounded.</note> all the Chriſtian power together, and to goe and aſſaile thoſe that are our deſtruction: for of all warres, this is the moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.

Likewiſe for the defence of lawes, honeſtie, vertue, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and diſcipline, which the rage of theſe barbarous people doe pretend to burie in obliuion, and in liew therof to bring in impitie, vice, ignoraunce and thieuerie. This likewiſe reuealeth an other poynt worthie the noting in all humaine actions, namely Iuſtice, which ought to bée the foundation of them all. But it appeareth ſo cleerely as none can gainſay it.

Hereto alſo I will adde this word, that no act can be more iuſt then in that ſubdued parte of <hi>Europe</hi> to purchaſe the redreſſe of politick order, which in it comprehendeth all kindes of Iuſtice, publick and perticular. I ſuppoſe, if wee could either in eye or Image beholde only two ſorts of the vyolence (beſides innumerable others) which theſe barbarous wretches do practiſe againſt the poore Chriſtians, our <hi>ſloth</hi> would be turned into <hi>zeale.</hi> The firſt, that yeerely in the Prouinces that they haue ſubdued, they pull away, euen out of the mothers boſomes, fiue or ſixe hundred ſmall children, whome they tranſport to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> there to be inſtructed in their ſect and armes. The ſecond, that yeerely in their courſes and roades here and there, they take at the leaſt twiſe ſo many poore Chriſtians whom they ſell againe: whereby the father is caried one way, the ſonne an other, the huſband into the Eaſt, the wife into the Weſt, there to bee ſlaues all the daies of their life, without hope of euer ſeeing one an other againe: ſuch a ſeperation as is made with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable teares. Neither doe I here comprehend the ſpoyles of warres, which in ſome one voyage ſwalloweth vp 40. or 50000 ſoules. This is only the ordinarie that I ſet downe, the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance whereof in tenne or twelue yeeres will breede, if we well note it, a great extraordinarie.</p>
               <p>Many there are that confeſſe this to bee true, and there ſettle <note place="margin">Againſt thoſe that thinke the Turkiſh tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to be ſo farre of as it can neuer reach vnto them.</note> themſelues, without proceeding any farther, as imagining the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe to bee ſo farre of that it can neuer come neere to them, and therefore doe leaue to thoſe that are neerer thereunto, the feeling that they ought to haue thereof. This is no ſmall ouerſight, which ſheweth that they regard only their owne intereſt, a matter at this day too common among moſt men: for there are ſo fewe that take care either to pitie others, or reſpect Iuſtice, as humanitie and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie doe ſeeme to be vtterly extinguiſhed. In like error remayned our forefathers, I meane thoſe that were neere neighbours to the Countries now left in pray: for through their retchleſneſſe &amp; ſmall care to fauour them, they are loſt, and haue left their neighbours in perpetuall feare of falling into the like inconuenience.

               <p>I knowe that ſometimes a great power ſtayeth a time without <note place="margin">How terrible the Turkes power is at this day and why.</note> doing any great exployt, as wee ſee that for theſe fortie yeeres they haue not much encroched toward <hi>Germany,</hi> but likewiſe that not many yeeres before they conquered almoſt all <hi>Hungary</hi> and made <hi>Tranſiluany</hi> tributarie. And thinking well therof I finde that they ſhall neede ſo ſmall ſucceſſe to terrifie all Chriſtendome, that I do alreadie apprehende that inconuenience. It is well knowne that <hi>Sultan Soliman</hi> twiſe beſieged the towne of <hi>Vienna in Auſtrich,</hi> which <hi>Charles the</hi> 5. ſuccoured.

That if the Realme when it floriſhed and abounded in all things ſtoode in néede of ſuch helpe, much more neceſſary is it now while it is deuided, weakened and poore; becauſe the auncient hatred of thoſe that ſeeke the abaſing thereof may yet gather ſtrength and force. This mooueth them to feare perpetuall reproach with mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt daunger to the ſtate, if they ſhould counſaile their maiſter to depriue himſelfe of ſuch ſuccour, the loſſe whereof may embolden the neighbors to more willingly the aſſaile him.

Neither (to ſpeake as a Chriſtian) ſhould

any man wiſh two ſo mightie Monarchies to goe together by the eares. For ſo ſhould they bring their confederates to partaking, and of a priuate controuerſie make a generall warre. And no doubt the <hi>Turke</hi> would thereof take occaſion to worke wonderfull prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes againſt vs, which for want of withſtanding through our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall diſſentions, would breede our great hinderances. Some man will adde that the ſmall Potentates will bee glad the great ones ſhould feede each vpon other: truely if the great ones ſhould ſeeke to deuoure them, they might haue great reaſon to wiſh it: but ſeeing them willing to vndertake to do that which may profite all, all ought likewiſe to wiſh their good and to helpe them therein. The true meanes therefore to take away the feare from ſome and couetouſneſſe from other ſome, were ioyntly to employ themſelues in theſe high enterpriſes.</p>
               <p>As for the warres of Princes againſt their ſubiects, it were good <note place="margin">Of the vnion of princes with their ſubiectes and the cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from all acts of hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and ciuill warres within their lands.</note> (if it were poſſible) to quench them: becauſe they are ſufficient to diuert them from all other intents. To which purpoſe I ſay that ſubiects are to remember that their ſoueraigne Princes are as the viſible Images of God, whom he hath eſtabliſhed vpon the earth as his Lieutenants, to driue men to liue in <hi>Pietie, Iuſtice and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie,</hi> and to defend them from oppreſſion. In reſpect whereof they are to yeeld vnto them all honor, fidelitie, ſeruice &amp; obedience, as alſo the Princes are to beare them like goodwill as a father doth to his childe, and neuer to driue them into neceſſitie, leaſt they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into diſpayre. Through the maintenaunce of this goodly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, ſtates doe floriſh; whereas contrariwiſe the breach thereof ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteneth their deſtruction, as hath bene lately tryed to the great hurt of all <hi>France,</hi> and is yet in practiſe in <hi>Flanders</hi> to the deſolation therof. It is a lamentable matter to ſee thoſe that worſhip one ſelf Chriſt thus to purſue each other with fire &amp; blood like wild beaſtes, and the whiles to ſuffer theſe <hi>Mahumetiſtes</hi> to tryumph ouer the liues, lands, and ſpoyles of the poore Chriſtians of the Eaſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.

The Catholique Maieſtie, who, as it is ſayd, is very courteous, and thereof daily ſheweth great proofes in moſt but my ſelfe, ſhould diligently looke hereto: for all this bloodie tragedie is played at his coſts. Now is there no
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:8683:135"/>
queſtion of ſtate, but only for religion: whereof, albeit no man aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth my counſaile, neither wil beléeue me, yet I will ſpeake a word or two. The way were, in my opinion, to proceede by gentleneſſe, not to iudge by foreiudgement: and to frame the lawes according to the natures, and not to leane ſo much to the reportes of ſome, as to the iuſt complaints of many ſubiects: as being aſſured that conſciences cannot bee forced without merueilous force. Finally, the ſucceſſe of things paſt may haue taught that thoſe princes who by warres haue endeuoured to accompany the vehemencie of their Prieſts, haue diſfigured their dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; deminiſhed their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And what <hi>Ieſuite</hi> is there, how ſkilfull ſoeuer, that is able to perſwade thoſe that bee no <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> that God delighteth in ſo much blood as on both ſides is ſhed? The people of the <hi>Low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> are of a free nature, the affections of whoſe hearts are remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by clemencie and vnfayned humanitie: but by ſtripes and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they be prouoked and alienated. The ſureſt counſaile therfore were to graunt to thoſe that are in armes the permiſſion which they craue to ſerue God, to the ende they may yeeld alſo the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that man doth require: for it is to be ſuppoſed that if this bee not willingly done, time will wreſt it by force: which may as well breede fauourable accidents to the loſers, as it hath done to the winners. The liuelieſt ſting and ſharpeſt pricke to mooue the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards</hi> to peace, is the remembrance of the folly of <hi>France,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may ſay: <hi>We haue ſcaped fayre.</hi> This difficultie ſhall not let <note place="margin">Vpon what conſideration the enterprize againſt the Turke ought to be of great commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among all Chriſtian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> me from proceeding in my diſcourſe, and by diuers examples to ſhewe that this enterpriſe againſt the <hi>Turkes,</hi> ought to be vnto vs in great recommendation. Our grandfathers had courage enough to aſſaile their grandfathers euen in their owne cities and fieldes, which they watered with the blood of theſe miſereants: which proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that the children are not inuincible. Wherfore the better to ſee thoſe notable victories, we may reade the hiſtorie of <hi>Paulus Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> who treateth of the conqueſt of the <hi>Holy land.</hi> It is meruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to ſee how zealous euery man then was to employe himſelfe in theſe forrein expeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wherfro neither the dangers could ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the yong, nor the tediouſneſſe of the way the old: but both ſorts either ſold or morgaged part of their goods to furniſh &amp; ſet forth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues therin.

and driuing them away. Many other vayages haue ſince bene made by diuers Emperours &amp; Kings which haue had good &amp; bad ſucceſſe: wherof I will ſpeake in time conuenient. At this time it ſhall ſuffiſe to beholde in theſe by oyles the zeale of ſo many noble perſonages: the conſent of nations: the magnanimitie of gentrie: the liberalitie of all men: &amp; finally the high proweſſe &amp; conqueſtes of ſo many warriors, to the end by the motions therof our affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s now as it were aſleepe, may awake &amp; buſtle themſelues to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ende which our aunceſters ſhot at. For it were a great ſigne of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating from the auncient vertue, if we ſhould not ſtirre againſt theſe our terrible enemies that approach euen to our doores, ſith they trauailed aboue 600. leagues out of <hi>France</hi> to ſeeke them. And yet are wee to feare them much more then they, becauſe their power is fower times as much againe as it was then. This may bee a warning to Princes (being reſolued to enter into this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe) to be the more carefull to lay the foundations ſo ſure as they may not be ſhaken. For if through negligence or haſte there ſhould happen any default, it would be ſomewhat troubleſome to redreſſe, and it would fall out as to thoſe that build a beautifull Bridge vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weake pillers, who are afterward for the repayring thereof driuen to breake it downe againe.</p>
               <p>I haue here afore made mention of two foundations, conſiſting <note place="margin">Hauing trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of this warre, it is here ſpoken of the proceeding thereof, and firſt of the generall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly for the entire reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</note> the one vpon the <hi>iuſtice of the warre,</hi> the other vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>neceſsity:</hi> which both are throughly to bee conſidered, becauſe by ſeeing the grounds to be good, we conceiue the better hope of the ende which we pretend. Now it remaineth that we proéeed in the reſt, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall whereof dependeth vpon the will of the Princes, whence the generall vnion muſt grow. For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is it which beareth vp the whole frame and maketh it to moue. And in as much as the matter that may hinder it is to bee ouercome (as wee haue ſeene) we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that after diuers negotiations and iourneys too and fro, the Princes may in the ende growe to reſolution. This compaſſed, it were good to ſummon ſome notable aſſembly wherein to deliberate vpon the whole, &amp; to ſweare to whatſoeuer may be concluded. And ſith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor ſhould be one of the chief dealers &amp; withal of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt dignitie, he to appoynt the place (ſo as the Pope would not be ielous) where the Embaſſadours of the greateſt Princes might méete, whether alſo the meaner will come in perſon, for that the Emperour himſelfe ſhould be there. To which purpoſe the towne of <hi>Auſbourg</hi> (in my opinion) might well ſerue for them all, where
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:8683:136"/>
alſo with the aduice of many other ſkilfull Captaines they might better determine all matters.</p>
               <p>Hauing formed ſuch a confederacie, it were requifite to go on &amp; to prouide fit means to continue the warre at the leaſt foure yeres, <note place="margin">Of the meanes to continew the warres di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers yeares.</note> to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> end none might giue it ſoouer ouer without incurring reproch and diſpleaſure of al the other Princes, either elſe not to enter ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into at all. For to begin this warre, and then to leaue it vnfiniſhed, would breede too great inconuenience, as hauing forced a mighty enimie to play double or quit, wherinto being entred, he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture attempt ſuch deuiſes as before he neuer thought vppon. True it is that it is hard ſo ſure to bind thoſe Princes which depend but of themſelues, howbeit, all that might be muſt be done: for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie experience teacheth, that onely three or foure leagued toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, can hardly long agree. And ſometime before the firſt peece be performed, ſome one ſhrinketh, who then wanteth no reaſons nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes therefore.</p>
               <p>Then muſt they prouide for treaſure, for forein wars are neuer wel <note place="margin">Of treaſure to maintaine this warre.</note> conducted without abundance, &amp; want doth oft make them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caie. In the firſt warr againſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Mahumetiſts,</hi> the zeale &amp; affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ſo great y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> moſt men waged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues of their owne goods. Afterward they were holpen with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> treaſure which through y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſats</hi> that the Popes publiſhed, was leauied in ſundrie realmes and prouinces. This help, whether it now proceeded of the Popes or of the authority of princes, &amp; were tearmed either <hi>Croiſade</hi> or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, would be neceſſarie to helpe the Potentates to defray their charges. For hauing gathered among their ſubiects an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſumme (yet not immoderate) &amp; thereto laying part of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie reuenues, it would ſuffice to maintain great armies. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſith in our ſmal wars we ſtil find want of money, it were meet to lay a good foundation for treaſure a yere before the enterpriſiug of any thing: for beeing of ſufficient abilitie before they begin, they ſhould afterward hardly incurre any want. It may bee ſaid that to threaten the enimie ſo far before hand, were as much as to giue him time to prouide: but hauing well waied all, it were a greater incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience, according to the prouerbe, <hi>To take ſhipping without biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet.</hi> Beſides, it is to be imagined that their pride &amp; glory is ſuch, &amp; they ſo much contemne the Chriſtians, that they will take it to bee rather ſome brag to terrifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than any preparation to aſſaile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As for power, I thinke no man can denie but that Chriſtendome is at this daie verie mightie.

domeſtical warres haue greatly exerciſed in armes. The art of war is alſo better knowen than it hath bene theſe 150. yeeres, whereto the knowledge of hiſtories both Greeke &amp; Latine, conioyned with experience, haue bene a great helpe.

In this point we of force confeſſe that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome hath not now any of ſo great experience, as euen in our daies we haue ſeene: as the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> the Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> the Admirall of <hi>Chaſtillion,</hi> and for the ſea <hi>Andrew Dorie.</hi> Howbeit we cannot likewiſe ſaie that it is vtterly vnprouided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for although thoſe that remain be but yong, yet do they follow the ſteps of the others, neither want they any thing but the ſubiect of a braue war, the more to diſplay their vertue: beſides that many times good hap accompanieth young heads, as appeared in <hi>Don Iohn of Auſtria at Lepanto, the Duke of Anguien at Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolles, the Duke of Sanoy at S, Quintins, the Earle of Aigmo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at Graueling, &amp; eſpecially the Prince of Parma in Fla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders.</hi> We are to thinke that we liue in a time wherin the large ſchooles are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen for Captaines to learne to frame themſelues &amp; grow good. Let vs therefore content our ſelues with thoſe that yet liue, &amp; hope well of their conduct. I will name none particularly, for they be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently knowen, who in <hi>Spaine, France, Italy</hi> &amp; <hi>Germany</hi> haue pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed fame.</p>
               <p>Now are we to looke to diſcipline, wherof I wil ſay thus much, <note place="margin">Of Martiall diſcpline.</note> that without great care that it be diligently obſerued &amp; kept, we are not to look for any good iſſue of the war. We ſee how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ciuil wars haue quite corrupted it, and the infection is ſhed ouer all nations, though ouer ſome more than otherſome. It were meet therefore at the firſt to eſtabliſh rules which may be put in practiſe, &amp; thereto to ad both a puniſhment &amp; reward: for if we carry our accuſtomed diſor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders into theſe wars, we ſhal ſoone become a praie to the Turkes. <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> diſcourſing how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Romaines</hi> attained to their great conqueſts, among other things attributeth it to their good obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of order &amp; diſcipline. Yet do I not herein require as great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as in thoſe daies, but rather to fit the coat to the bodie, &amp; the laws to the vertue. I doubt not but ther is yet enough ſpred abroad among our Chriſtian nations: Whereof if a great part were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

into one armie, it would ſuffice to bring forth good fruit. Theſe <note place="margin">Of other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne withall.</note> be the principall preparatiues which the Princes ſhould conſider of betimes. For the reſt, which neuertheleſſe are neceſſary, as wepons, veſſels, artillerie, &amp; munition, they are much eaſier to bée gotten. <hi>Philip of Macedon Alexander</hi> the greats father prepared for ſuch things as he needed for his wars a yere or two before hand: but he died before he could begin, &amp; his ſonne finiſhed them: &amp; yet it ſerued his turne wel, that he found all things redie, but eſpecially he made great account of fiue or ſix old Captains whom his father left him. Another <hi>Philip</hi> the father of <hi>Perſeus,</hi> purpoſing wars againſt the <hi>Romaines,</hi> made no leſſe preparation, though his ſonne imploied it but badly. And we are as greatly to feare the Turkiſh nation as they did the others, for it holdeth at this day the greateſt Empire in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. Many there are y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being badly informed of their cuſtomes, <note place="margin">Againſt thoſe that thinke the Turkes eaſy to be ſubdued.</note> do take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be barbarous people, giuen to cruelty, &amp; wanting all other good qualities, wherin they are deceiued: for among all ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the world, they ſhew themſelues moſt ſober, obedient of their Captains, &amp; diligent.

I leaue it therfore to any good Captains iudgement, if they ſhould thus doe (conſidering their great numbers of people) whether it were poſſible to ſtande before them: if they ſhould arme but 50000. horſmen after our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſurely the ſame would ſuffice to fight with al the horſe in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome: but they put in their general armies well neere 200000 which is an incredible matter.</p>

admiration, ſeeing all the earth couered with horſe &amp; men as thicke as trees in a large forreſt. When we in our ſmal warres ſee 10. or 12000. horſe, we thinke them able to fight with the whole worlde, what then would we ſaie if we ſhould ſee theſe wonderfull troops? They haue euermore vſed to march thus: yea, the <hi>Sarazens</hi> whome they ſucceeded in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of <hi>Mahumet</hi> vſed mightie armies, though not ſo ſtrong in horſe. I will not ſtand vppon the deſcription of the large extent of their dominions, as being a thing ſufficiently know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, onely I will ſaie that in <hi>Europe</hi> they holde more land than all <hi>France, Spaine</hi> &amp; <hi>Italy</hi> doe containe, from whence they take theyr beſt men of warre, where alſo they keepe them, partly in garriſons and partly vppon their conquered landes which they diuide among them, with charge to bee alwayes readie to ſerue vppon anie the great Lords commandements, ſo as out of the ſayd Prouinces of <hi>Europe,</hi> they are able to bring into the field neere 100000. horſe, which is a token y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the barbarouſneſſe that we take to be in them, is not altogether deuoide of wiſedome and pollicie. They vſe not to fortefie many holdes, for no man dare enterpriſe to aſſault anie of their chiefeſt, but he ſhall ſtraight waies be aſſured of a mightie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer at hand readie to make him giue ouer quicklie.

To bee briefe, they be moſt mightie enimies: againſt whom whoſoeuer ſhall deale, he had not neede to forget anie thing at home (as wee vſe to ſay) but doe as they that enter the liftes, who before they do come, loke to increaſe their ſtrength &amp; courage: to ſee to ſee their defenſiue armes ſit, and their offenſiue ſharp, to the end either to ouercome, or die valiantly.</p>
               <p>Now are we to enter into the chiefe point of this matter, which is, of the meanes how to aſſaile theſe terrible enimies, in what pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <note place="margin">Of the manner how to aſſiuill the Turkes: in what places and with what power.</note> &amp; with what power, to the end within the time afore noted to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiue a happie concluſion.

not let as briefly as I may, to ſaie my minde, according as I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at the firſt, alwaies ſubmitting the ſame to the cenſures of ſuch as are more ſkilfull than my ſelfe, to correct the imperfections therof.

The better neuertheleſſe to behaue our ſelues in ſuch a warre, I thought good to ſet down ſome examples of but anceſtors, who ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times fought againſt the ſame nation, to the end that what they wiſely executed may be to vſe a rule, by fitting it to our time, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we may eſchue and auoid their ouerſights.</p>
               <p>I will not enter into ſearch of matters beyonde <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bolleine</hi> (albeit there were greate warres before betweene the Emperours of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and the <hi>Saracens)</hi> in whoſe daies the Chriſtian Princes beganne to confederate themſelues agaynſt them. The firſt armie that was ſent went vnder the leading of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> the Hermite, who paſſed euen into the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> and at the firſt acchieued a few valiant exploites: but he and all his men were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ouerthrowen by the <hi>Souldan</hi> of <hi>Nicee.</hi> Likewiſe two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther armies as they marched, were broken by the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> a nation which at that time had ſcarcely attayned the rudimentes of Chriſtianitie, and as yet did holde of the auncient fierceneſſe of the <hi>Hunnes:</hi> ſo as theſe firſt expeditions yeelded ſmall fruit and great hurt. The cauſe of which diſorders &amp; inconueniences proceeded (as I thinke) of the want of authoritie and experience of their leaders, who vpon a zeale, aſſembled al theſe troups gathered out of diuers nations, in whom peraduenture they founde not conuenient obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and wanting foundation both in purpoſe and prouiſion, could not long holde out, neither among their friendes, neither agaynſt their enimies.</p>
               <p>The hiſtories reporte that in the firſt expedition there were unleſſe than 100000. able men. And the <hi>Hungarians</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the others (which were not ſo many) becauſe by the way they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wee can therefore make no account of the greacneſſe of a multitude, if there be no order among them, which eſpecially fayleth when their Captaines be either inſufficient or want authoritie.

Many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were alſo once beſieged at <hi>Antioch,</hi> but they ſharply repulſed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Sarazens</hi> and <hi>Turkes,</hi> with great ſlaughter.

Neither wil I let ſlip the inconueniences of thoſe long iourneyes: for the tediouſneſſe of the way, the diſtemperance of the aire, &amp; the continual trauaile bred ſundrie diſeaſes among thoſe great troopes, which were holpen for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the exceſſe of the mouth too much vſed in theſe north parts.

               <p>But to proceede, we are to vnderſtand that after the poſteritie of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:8683:139"/>
                  <hi>Godfrey of Bolleine</hi> had inioyed the lande aboue 80. yeeres, ciuill <note place="margin">What was the cauſe that our forefathers loſt the aduantage they had of them, &amp; were driuen out of the eaſt.</note> diſſention crept in among them, and ſome of them calling the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi> to their aide, grew ſo ſtrong that they droue out the reſt. This afterward moued diuerſe Chriſtian Princes to ioyne againe in the recouerie of that which was loſt ſo as in fiue or ſix ſcore yeres they made ſixe or ſeauen notable voiages. wherein went perſonally the Emperours <hi>Fredericke Barbaroſſa, Frederick the ſecond, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade king of Germanie,</hi> ſome kings of <hi>France</hi> and of <hi>England,</hi> wherof neuertheleſſe grew ſmal profit. At the beginning the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had goodly victories, but in the end they had the foile, &amp; were neuer able to expell the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> out of the lands that they had recoueres. All theſe later loſſes proceeded of ſundrie cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as of particular warres leauied by ſome of the princes that ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed behinde in their lands that were gone y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> voiages: of want of wine &amp; other prouiſion: of the ſmall perſeuerance of them that were lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, of the peſtilence that fell in the armie: &amp; finally, of ſuch hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances as the Emperors of <hi>Greece</hi> did vnderhand work to the we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteru forces: enuying, as it ſhuld ſeme, their generoſity, &amp; being loth they ſhuld conquere the land which y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

But the Turkes great power vpon the ſeaneuer appeared ſo much as after the loſſe of: <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> For hauing ſo commodious a harborow, they thereof tooke occaſion to thinke vppon ſea matters, ſhewing themſelues terrible in the conqueſt of Ilandes and firme land, where they haue deſcended.

Then their loſſes in the <hi>Perſian</hi> warres haue much weakened them, whereof we are to gather that their great proſperitie which ſo long hath accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them, doth now begin to droope. Thirdly, <hi>Don Iohns</hi> victory hath eaſed vs of one errour wherein wee were, which is, that wee thought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be by ſea inuincible, &amp; withal taught vs what adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in ioyning we haue ouer them: wherein wee ſhould ſcarcelie haue bene confirmed but by this experience.

I know our ſinnes are the chiefe cauſes that God vſeth them as ſcourges to ſmite vs, but we neede not doubt but they haue like wiſe fourefolde procured his wrath. And who knoweth whether their time bee not come to receiue the ſame that they haue inflicted vpon others? We ought to be aſſured that in his iuſt iudgementes toward his, hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes mixeth his abundaunt mercie with his wrath, and they that be veſſelles of his wrath, ſhall ſoone or late feele his vengeance without mercie.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe I will alleade a fooliſh Prophetie contained in their <hi>Alcaron</hi> where I haue read it, not that I thinke anie truth <note place="margin">Prediction of the Turkes Alcoran.</note> to be harboured in theyr falſe Oracles vnderpropped with lies: but becauſe ſometime the wicked haue at vnawares foretolde thinges that haue afterward come to paſſe: This it is. <hi>In the later dayes it ſhal come to paſſe, that the Muſulmans, that is to ſay, the Turkiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               <p>I haue bene long before I could ſpeake of the meanes to aſſayle <note place="margin">The meanes to ſet vpon the Turkes.</note> theſe ſo mightie aduerſaries: and the rather becauſe I haue imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the former matters verie requiſite for the better vnderſtanding of that which I wil ſaie. To begin therefore I wil ſet to your view ſome counſayles of our forefathers, out of the which we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good inſtructions, who for the like cauſes haue often beene ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to frame braue purpoſes. <hi>Guic ciardine</hi> the hiſtoriographer, who well noted ſuch things as happened in his time, reporteth that when <hi>Selim</hi> had conquered all <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and obtayned ſundrie victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries elſe where, all Chriſtendome grew into great feare. His owne wordes becauſe they deſerue conſideration I will ſet downe. <hi>The Pope</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>with all the Court of Rome aſtoniſhed at ſuch ſucceſſe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Guicciard. lib. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>and to the end to prouide againſt ſo great a miſchiefe, ſhewing that he would firſt craue Gods helpe, commanded ſundrie deuout proceſſions at Rome, wherin himſelfe went barefoote: Then calling vpon the help of men, hee ſent his Mandats to all Christian Princes, admoniſhing them of this great danger, and perſwading them to laie aſide all diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and contentions, ſpeedely to attend to the defence of religion and their common ſafetie, which was continuallie oppoſed to great danger, if with courage and vnited force they tranſported not the warre into Turkie, and ſo inuaded not the enimie in his owne Countrie. Here vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the opinions of ſundrie ſkilfull men of warre and others that knew the Countries &amp; diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as wel of the Princes as of the power of the Turks, being taken, it was thought neceſſary to make great prouiſion of money by the voluntarie contributions of Princes &amp; an vniuerſal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtio be leuied ouer all Chriſtendome. That the Emperour with the Hungarian and Polonian horſemen, warlyke nations &amp; ſuch as were practiſed in continuall wars agaynſt the Turkes, as alſo with ſuch the ſtrength of Germanie as might beſeeme ſo great an enterpriſe, ſhoulde ſayle along Danowe into Boſina in olde time tearmed Miſia, and ſo into Thrace, and to approch vnto Conſtantinople, the imperiall ſea of the Ottomans.

That the Pope ſhould take the ſame courſe with an hundred great gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. With theſe preparatiues ſufficient to couer both ſea and land, the Turkes eſtates being inuaded in ſo many places, who make their chit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt account of defence in the plaine field, it ſeemeth (eſpecially adding therto the innocation of Gods name, that of ſo holy a warre there could not be hoped but a happie end.</hi>

               <p>This deliberation of the moſt excellent Captaines then liuing. I <note place="margin">To what vſe the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cards may ſerue, &amp; what is to be altered in theſe daies.</note> finde to be ſo well grounded, that I thinke we might borowe much of theirs but had the execution thereof inſued, we ſhould the better haue ſéene what it had ben, howbeit the death of <hi>Selim</hi> comming on, aſſwaged the feare of theſe Princes, &amp; ſo conſequently their deſire to proceed, whereby they paſſed but to wordes. Now as ſince there haue followed great alterations, ſo are we to frame our ſelues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſpoſition of matters, &amp; ſomwhat to vary from this platforme, but rather in the particularities, than principall pointes thereof.</p>
               <p>Firſt we may be certaine that it is to ſmall purpoſe to inuade the Turkes by lande onely, or by ſea onely: for leauing them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe gaps open, they will thereby ſo moleſt vs, as that they will turne vs from the other, in kindling the flames farther within our houſes, than we can do in theirs. In reſpect wherof it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to ſet their whole eſtate in <hi>Europein</hi> combuſtion, by following the wars in euery part thereof, which is vnpoſſible to be performed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out a mighty power as wel by ſea as by la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which our anceſtors thought expedient, as alſo it is (as <hi>Guicciardine</hi> ſaith) the perfect meanes to abridge any warre: for being ſtrong, ye ſhal ſoone bring your enimies to reaſon either by victory or compoſition: Wheras contrariwiſe when it is weakly followed, it groweth ruinous.

But becauſe it is an eaſie matter to know, that for the well inuading of thoſe countries, both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers muſt be matched together, I wil ſpeak no more therof. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> partition of theſe princes forces, which <hi>Guicciardine mentioneth,</hi> it is not amiſſe, nor the inuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of 3. ſides: albeit I think it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for vs to ſtick to two. For I conſider that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole defence of the Turks lands conſiſteth in 2. great armies, the one vpon the land, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea, neither hathhe anie fortified places as we haue, ſo as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loſſe of one of theſe props is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opening of a gate vnto vs, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reaſon why I would wiſh we ſhould make but 2. ſtrong bodies wherwith to attempt our enterpriſes.

This other reaſon wil I alſo adde: that if both our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as wel by ſea as by land do ſhoot at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and by winning litle &amp; litle do attaine therto, muſt it not needs follow, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in performing this purpoſe, they ſhal ſeaze not only vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:8683:142"/>
The other part of the land forces to come from the moſt <hi>Chriſtian king of France, the Queene of England, the king of Scots with the Suitzers and Griſons,</hi> who vnder ſome notable Captaine ſhould ioyne with the Emperor, and in my opinion, would amount vnto ſome 20000. footemen &amp; 5000. horſe. This power would I take to be ſufficient to obtayne ſome braue victorie, containing at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt 125000. fighting men, which ſeemeth to be a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but if we alſo conſider all Chriſtendome, it is to be thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſmall: neither doe I thinke they will be grieued with maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it foure yeeres, ſith ſo they may reape this benefit, to inioy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in peace and ſafetie. <hi>Charles</hi> the fift onely of his owne and part of the Empire brought before <hi>Metz</hi> 80000. men, and the armie that <hi>Maximilian</hi> laſtly raiſed againſt the Turks in the yere 1556. amounted vnto 60000. ſo as we ſhall performe no newe thing, but onely in the continuance thereof.</p>
               <p>Concerning Captaines ouer the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> the Emperour himſelfe might command, who cannot imploie his higneſſe in anie <note place="margin">What Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines were meet to com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mand in the Chriſtians ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</note> act more worthie his greatneſſe, and he to be accompanied with his vnkles and brethren. The <hi>Dukes of Saxonie, Caſimire</hi> and other Germaine Princes, Earles, and Colonels, among whom he ſhould finde both proweſſe and good conduct. As for the French and what ſhould thereto be adioyned, we may eaſily finde Princes enowe to command: but I will name but two, whome I take to bee moſt meete, namely, the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> who in deſire of wel doing and courage, giueth place to none: and the Duke of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> whoſe aunceſtours hauing bene ſcourges to the Turkiſh nation, it is to be preſumed that their auncient good hap may accompanie his valor. So as it ſhould reſt in the King to appoint which of them ſhoulde haue charge, or if he ſhould commit it to them both alternatiuely, I am ſure neither of them ſhould want a goodly traine, as wel of the one as of the other religion. The nauie likewiſe woulde haue ſome mightie Captaine. And in as much as many doe certainly beleeue that the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> (a Prince of great expectation &amp; an imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of his Fathers magnanimitie) will enter alliance in <hi>Spaine,</hi> it may be the Catholike king may honour him with that office: for that authoritie is requiſite to rule ſo much nobilitie and Gentrie as ſhould there be found of both nations, who are not eaſie to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned. Howbeit conſidering what experience ought to be in ſuch a head, I knowe none more capable than the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> who iuſtly deſerueth to be commended for the beſt Captain in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:8683:142"/>
But I feare that euerie mans deſire to be employed in this expedition, would moderate the iealouſies of the firſt and ſeconde places, alſo that ſuch debates would eaſily be decided.</p>
               <p>When I conſider what Princes, Lords, Gentlemen, Captaines <note place="margin">Of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall members of this army.</note> and notable Souldiours ſhall be in theſe expeditions, I knowe not how ſuch power can poſſiblie be beaten: For if in al Chriſtendome there were anie vertue, diſcretion, magnanimitie, arte or induſtrie, the moſt exquiſite thereof would vndoubtedly be brought thether by thoſe, who enflamed with a deſire of well doing, would liberallie in ſo noble an aſſemblie ſhew forth whatſoeuer the faireſt of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, one would ſeke by cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, another by boldnes, another by diligence, each to outgoe his companion. The like ſhall wee ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our nobilitie: not coutentious enuies, but honeſt emulations, who might be moſt notable in well obeying and better commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. When ye haue in an armie a number of ſuch people as can leade the waie to others, and take ſure holde without letting goe, they make all the reſt to fight well. Neither can I thinke that there be many ſuch among the Turks, who being for the moſt part ſlaues doe fight for feare of puniſhment, rather than for loue of true glorie.</p>
               <p>Theſe armies ſhould be readie as well by land as by ſea, to march <note place="margin">At what time the Chriſtian power ſhould begine their warre &amp; how.</note> whereſoeuer they ſhall be appointed at the beginning of May. But al the difficultie reſteth in knowing how to inuade, for we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede therein after ſundrie manees. I would thinke that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould wholy purpoſe at the beginning of their war to grow to battayle with theſe barbarous people: for ſith their Empire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth onely vpon the good will of nations, we ſhall ſee wonderfull alterations, if at the firſt ariual they may in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This doe I confeſſe to be often put in practiſe: but we are to hope with ſo mightie and proude enimies as the Turkes, that it wil fall out as with a greate Boare whome the dogges haue het: for what ſoeuer he firſt ſeeth, man or dogge, by and by he maketh towarde it with wonderfull furie.</p>
               <p>We neuer found in writing that they haue bene ſlowe to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, for that they ſtill ſeeke to vphold the reputation of their name and armies. When they heare of the Chriſtians preparation to wars, they proceede in lyke ſort, and before we can come within 50.

leagues of their frontiers, they are ſo diligent that they haue ſacked halte ours. Whereby we know that they would ſoone couer the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſard, as we ſaie: and hauing throughly conſidered heereof, I finde that it would be a great aduantage vnto vs: for the heare and furie of Northerne nations is at the firſt verie forcible, but by delayes quaileth.</p>
               <p>Now let vs ſee wherein the land armie ſhould conſiſt, namelie, in 18000. Reiſtres, 10000. ſpeares armed after the French &amp; I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian <note place="margin">The troupes of the army that ſhould march by lande.</note> manner, 2000. harquebuzes on horſeback, and 10000. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian and <hi>Polonian</hi> ſpeares to ſerue for light horſemen. For the power muſt be receiued, each after the manner of his owne nation. The footmen to be compoſed of 20000. harquebuziers and 30000 ſpeares, in all amounting to 40000. horſe and 50000. footmen, all fighting men.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe for artillerie for the fielde, twentie Canons, and twentie greate Culuerines, accompanied with the pioners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayd, and virtuall ſufficient for ſuch an armie. The thinking of all this maketh vs to reioyce, but when we dreame vpon the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it danteth vs: for it will require monthly 800000. Crownes, which riſeth to a great deale in a whole yeere. Furthermore, leaſt ſuch an armie if it ſhould go farre from the great riuers, or enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the land, ſhould be much hindred for want of victuals and forage, it ſhall be forced to keep along the riuer of <hi>Danow,</hi> and there to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their firſt purpoſes, ſo might they abound in all neceſſarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, which ſhould be brought by the ſame. It is alſo meete to haue a bridge of boates accompanied with armed gallies to follow it, ſo to keepe both ſhores of the ſaid riuer as well for forages as for the ſiege of ſuch places as ſtand thervpon.</p>
               <p>I thinke that <hi>Strigonia</hi> is one of the firſt places that the Turks <note place="margin">Their firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuors.</note> holde: but neither it, nor anie other that they poſſeſſe are (as I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand) of any ſtrength: for when they doubt that any ſhall be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalted they put in 8. or 10000. ſouldiours, and looke for no other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification: and it is harde with ordinarie meanes onelie to wreaſt from them anie that is in theyr handes. Wherefore whether they ſhould fortune to bee the firſt or the laſt in the fielde, I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to the ende to binde them to fight, it were good to make ſhew and that in earneſt, to ſet vppon ſome places of importaunce, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make them to approche with theyr armie, ſo as they ſhoulde hardlie eſcape battayle, when they are come ſo neere with theyr carriage, footemen, and artillerie. For when they come but with
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:8683:143"/>
thirtie or fortie thouſande horſe to ſuccour what ſo is beſieged, they cannot by anie meanes be ouercome by reaſon of the ſwifteneſſe of theyr horſe, which neuertheleſſe dooth greatly moleſt a campe. I woulde alſo lyke verie well, that in tenne or twelue dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Their exerciſes.</note> the armie ſhoulde marche, the Captaines euerie other daie ſhoulde caſt them into ſeuerall orders of battayle, whereby to chooſe the beſt to help themſelues withall when neede ſhoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. For it doe much better conceiue the trueth of thinges by liuely repreſentations, than by forecaſt figured vppon paper: And by them is the generall the better reſolued in his conception, and the inferiour Captaines to bee the better prouided to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
               <p>Heerein doo wee in our pettie warres ordinarilie faile, in that wee neuer looke to the ordering of battayles vntill within two dayes before wee muſt fight: and then dooth the Generall ſette downe a fayre order in writing howe bee will haue it, which hee ſendeth vnto the leaders of the regimentes as well of the horſemen as of the footemen. For ſuch ordering many times, as beeing made ouer raſhly and without ripe deliberation, proueth verie vnfit. <note place="margin">The ordering therof in warre.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is verie requiſite that a Generall bee in minde verie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte in the order which hee purpoſeth to obſerue as well in the large fieldes as in the ſtraightes, leaſt hee bee amazed, or dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into much conſultation when his buſineſſe commeth vppon him. For the chiefe groundes beeing well layde, if through a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie accident the order bee to be altered, it is eaſilie performed. There bee ſome that will ſaie, that in ſo dooing wee ſhall warne the enimie of our order, whereby hee maye prouide to preuent vs.</p>
               <p>I graunt if wee ſtill vſe but one forme, it may be ſo. But when wee practiſe ſundrie, wee ſhall put all men in doubt which we will cleaue vnto, ſauing the Generall, who is to reſerue the beſt in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie. For the well ordering of this armie, it were good to haue the aduice of ſuch Captaines as hauing ſerued in <hi>Hungarie,</hi> doe by experience beſt knowe the moſt conuenient formes. And ſith I am entered ſo farre into this point, I am content for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfying of thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be curious, to deliuer my opinion concerning whatſoeuer may ſerue agaynſt theſe barbarous people. In this caſe we are to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of two kinds of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one large, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:8683:144"/>
ſtraight. Concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> large or plaine, as we terme it, which is the moſt parte of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> the battayle may be ſo aranged, that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies innumerable ſtrength of horſe (which wil amou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to 200000 at the leaſt) ſhall not without great loſſe endomage them, and verie hardly breake them.</p>
               <p>The order were to diſpearſe the horſemen among the footmen, as <note place="margin">Their order in a large contry.</note> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the like conſideration the late Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> did at the battel of <hi>Dreux.</hi> I woulde therefore make a ſtrong bodie of my armie conſiſting of eight battayles of footmen, each comprehending 2500 pikes, ſo as the ſayd rankes ſhould euerie of them containe ninetie men, &amp; be 28. men thick, beſides the Enſignes, &amp; to the flanks wold I ioyne 1000 harquebuziers. They ſhould be all ordered in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual front with ſufficient ſpaces to ſet in araie 2000. horſe in foure ſquadrons, each of them of fiue hundred men, &amp; fortie horſe in front, two ſomewhat for warder than the other two. Theſe ſeauen ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might ſerue them for places of aduantage, and aſſured retraits to fall into order againe: for it would be too hot to come vpon them into place where they ſhould be ſo ſuccoured by the harquebuzerie and pikes: yea, in my minde it were meere raſhneſſe. Likewiſe in as much as the flankes of the battayles are not commonly armed but with harquebuziers, which is but a weake defence againſt a great armie of horſe, I would thinke it were good both the flankes of the two battayles ſtanding vppon the wings of the armie to bee fortefied with ſome other inſtrumentes like vnto thoſe which the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> inuented and vſed when the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ouer <hi>Meuſe</hi> or better, which might be eaſily brought thether by two hundred pioners, and thoſe ſhould ſuffice for one of each flanks: as for the reſt they ſhall neede none, as well for that the force of this order ſhall ſupplie that want, as alſo becauſe it would be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumberſome. On the right and lefte point without the battayles ſhould ſtand at each ſixe thouſand horſe, euery ſquadron of one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and in two bodies the one to ſupport the other. And if anie man aſke wherefore I make them ſo great, I ſaie, it is becauſe the Turkes, as I haue heard, doe make theirs (eſpeciallie in any great combats) of fiue or ſixe thouſand ſpeares, which ſwallowe vp three hundred horſe, as a lion would doe a mouſe. And therefore we muſt ſette ſtrength agaynſt ſtrength. Then woulde I diuide my 5000. harquebuziers into ten troopes, placing ſixe, as it were, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturers, at the heads of the battayles toward the wings, and the other foure at the taile. I would alſo place two thouſand harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:8683:144"/>
on horſeback at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head of the horſemen vpon the wings to ſerue in the firſt ſkirmiſhes. Thus doe ye ſee in this great bodie 28000. horſe, 20000. Corcelets, &amp; 13000. harquebuzes aranged which as I thinke, will not take aboue 4000. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon paces in length, wherin there is no great diſproportion: and I haue thus ſtretched it out to the ende to debarre the enemie from all hope of encloſing it. There would be likewiſe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt ranke of this great front almoſt 1900. men, which is ſufficient. The reſt of the men I would thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt. I would make two ſmall bodies, which ſhould be ſet in aray 800. paces behinde the two winges of the armie: becauſe the firſt ſhockes doe begin there. In either of them would I place 4500. Corcelets in two battailes and 2500. Harquebuzes: then in the ſpaces and poynts 4000. horſe in eight ſquadrons, which for the two bodies would amount vnto 22000. men: euery wherof ſhould ſtirre when they perceiued any of the firſt troopes to yeeld: for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly they ſhould ſo make them to holde faſt. I would alſo place betweene theſe two troopes and 500. paces behinde them 3000. horſe in three ſquadrons, whom the Emperour, or in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence his Lieutenant ſhould accompanie when it were requiſite to fight: And this ſhould be the <hi>Holy ancker,</hi> as we tearme it, which ſhould vpon great neceſſitie moue forward. Yet doe there remaine 1000. Corcelets, 2000. Harquebuzes, and 1000. <hi>Reiſtres</hi> or <hi>Hungarian</hi> horſemen, that ſhould be appoynted to the keeping of the Campe, which the Pioners ſhould fortifie with ſmall trenches for the ſafegard of the cariages: for if through negligence the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, who might appoynt twentie or thirtie thouſand horſe to doe the feate, ſhould peraduenture be ſuffered to ſacke it, wee ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward bee driuen through the inconueniences both generall and perticuler to breake vp our Campe. This armie thus ordered were able in my opinion to ſtand in a plaine fielde againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole power of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> who being deſtitute of Corcelets, Pikes and armed ſquadrons, can hardly ouerthrowe our battailes. Wee ſee likewiſe how our horſe are ſurely prouided for in the ſpaces: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I ſuppoſe that either the enemie muſt be endued with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie valour, or our men ſhewe great cowardlineſſe if they loſe the battaile. This order haue I not here ſet downe as the beſt of all: for other men may peraduenture deuiſe ſome more conuenient: but it is done to the ende to inuite ſundrie Captaines to ſeeke what may be more profitable.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian armie thus in preſence of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> they after
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:8683:145"/>
a few Canon ſhot I preſume they will begin, both becauſe they be <note place="margin">Of the battaile by lande be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Chriſtians and Turkes.</note> very proude, and alſo that they bee ordinarily fower againſt one, which greatly embouldeneth them, and will peraduenture come with ſome three or foureſcore thouſande horſe to charge gallantly vpon the flanckes of our formoſt horſe, yea euen in the middeſt of the head: but I would thinke they ſhould at this onſet be well bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and repulſed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loſſe of ſome fower or fiue thouſand horſe: howbeit their horſe being very ſwift, they wil returne behind their maine battell to fall in aray againe. Then I imagine that hauing diſcharged ſome two volees of their Artillerie, whereof they haue plentie, they will giue a ſtrong charge with their whole bodie: whereof ſo much as ſhould ſtrike into the battailes or ſpaces would bée handled God knoweth how. But peraduenture the horſemen on the flanckes may bee ouerthrowne: which ſo happening, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 2. ſmall bodies appointed for their ſupport ſhould mooue: who finding the victorers in diſorderly purſuite (which alwaies for the moſt part happeneth) ſhould ſo brauely inuade them, as alſo ſhould ſome of the Squadrons, who ſtepping out of the ſpaces aforeſaid, ſhould come vpon their ſlanckes, that they ſhould bée quite broken. So ſhould alſo their Harquebuzerie, being ioyned with ours, beare the puniſhment of their raſhneſſe. Neuertheleſſe, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould not vndiſcréetly purſue them, for they are very ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in rallying themſelues, and would peraduenture ſo doe within two Canon ſhot, and ſo encloſe fower or fiue thouſand of the moſt eager vppon the chaſe, as their forefathers did <hi>D. Iohn of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie,</hi> and all the <hi>French</hi> Nobilitie in their battaile againſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murathes.</hi> Wherefore, it were requiſite for the whole Chriſtian armie to march and ſende after them ſome twentie thouſand horſe by ſquadrons, each ſupporting other, except the <hi>Hungarian and Polonian</hi> horſe, who might goe more diſperſedly in chaſe. And it may ſeeme enough to chaſe them thus one league. To be briefe, I ſuppoſe that in ſo notable a iourney they might bée defeated of halfe their footmen, all their Artillerie and cariages, and aboue twentie thouſand horſe: but in caſe but one quarter of ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployt were at the firſt performed, yet would it breede great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and in the Souldiers harts confirme a confidence to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. For he who in warre winneth the firſt aduantages, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a great hope of the iſſue.</p>
               <p>Now muſt wee ſpeake one worde of the ſtraight countries. It <note place="margin">Of the ordring of the army in the ſtraights.</note> ſeemeth the armie to bée there in more ſafetie then in the large, by
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:8683:145"/>
reaſon of the great numbers of their footmen: and there if the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie ſhould offer vpon them, they might alter their order accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the places, being ſtill diligent to keepe their aduantages of the Woodes, Uallies and Artillerie. But eſpecially they ought to beware of aranging their bodie in any ſuch ſorte, that the firſt ouerthrowne ſhould ſtrike into the ſecond: for that was the loſſe of the battaile of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> where <hi>King Iohn</hi> had fiftie thouſande men, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were but tenne thouſand. This ſo fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſucceſſe once obteyned, no doubt afterwarde (the reſt of the great Artillerie prouided at <hi>Vienna</hi> being cauſed to march) wee might in three moneths take from them fower or fiue of the beſt townes ſtanding vppon <hi>Danowe,</hi> as <hi>Strigon, Bude, Peſt</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which the enhabitants there about do better knowe. True it is there would be great lettes, and the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> armie, being refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, would not faile to fauour their places, where wee might ſee braue ſkirmiſhes. In the meane tyme, wee to keepe that earneſt for our firſt yeeres worke: I leaue to your imagination whether all Chriſtendome would reioyce, when they ſhould heare of ſuch a victorie obteyned ouer thoſe who for theſe two hundred yeeres haue but tryumphed of our deſtruction. Yea euen the ſmall babes would ſing foorth the praiſes of ſuch valiant perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, by whome ſuch notable exploytes ſhould haue bene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>Now let vs come to the Nauie, which being ſo mightie muſt <note place="margin">Of the exploits of the nauy.</note> not the whiles lye idely in the Hauens, but make ſaile to execute matters worthie thereof. My beſt counſaile were that it ſhould conforme it ſelfe to the lande power, in trying to bring the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to a daie of battaile: which peraduenture might bee eaſely done, as being of no leſſe pride by Sea then by lande: ſo as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs drawe towarde <hi>Greece,</hi> they will by and by bee vpon our armie, neither ſhall wee neede to counterfaite the beſiedging of any place to bring them thereto. And ſith the battaile of <hi>Lepanto</hi> hath made them wiſe, the Chriſtians muſt alſo bee well reſolued in their inuentions and other neceſſarie meanes to attaine to the victorie. There are other reaſons, beſides the equitie of a cauſe and vrgent neceſſitie, that ſtirre vp men to fight couragiouſly: As the <hi>preſence of noble perſons</hi> which deteſt cowardlineſſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt proweſſe: ſecondly the <hi>Captaines</hi> orations, wherein they exhort their ſouldiers to behaue themſelues manfully in ſolemne iorneys: Thirdly, <hi>confidence</hi> which encreaſeth when we ſee men well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:8683:146"/>
and the armie well ordered: Finally <hi>hope of reward,</hi> which is a good ſpurre to ſuch purpoſes. And aboue all other the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Captaines are meeteſt to take order herein, in whom, being accompanied with choiſe of valiant perſons, we are to thinke that neither order, courage, nor prouocation ſhall want. I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to diſcourſe of the putting of Nauies in aray, as one not ſo ſkilfull in Sea matters, notwithſtanding the order by <hi>Don Iohn</hi> obſerued at <hi>Lepanto,</hi> I haue alwaies thought to bee moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and well inuented.</p>
               <p>Some too fearefull or ouer circumſpect perſon may ſay, that the <note place="margin">That the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as well by land as by ſea ſhould inuade, and how.</note> hazarding of all our ſtrength at once is the way to bring all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome into great daunger. Whereto I aunſwer, that he which voluntarily entereth the carrier, doth purpoſe to runne: and ſo he that ſhippeth himſelfe in a warre, as the aſſailant, muſt aduenture, otherwiſe all his former preparations and threates are in vayne. For it is a greater daunger to ſuffer a mans ſelfe to be by little and little deuoured and to do nothing. An other as farre too eager, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering of all this power, would to the contrary that wee ſhould march directly to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and not to ſtay els where: but as this ſpeech is a token of courage, ſo is it a ſigne of ſmall expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience (at the leaſt as I thinke) becauſe armies march not in poſte. Moreouer, they doe ordinarily meete with barres and ſtops which they muſt firſt breake. For vndoubtedly the <hi>Turkes</hi> being certified of theſe great preparations of the Chriſtians both by ſea and by land, will ſet againſt them three hundred thouſand fighting men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom they muſt march with leaden héeles and Iron hands, and take as great heede of ouerſight by raſhneſſe as by retchleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, eſpecially in actions of great importance.</p>
               <p>Now preſuppoſe the <hi>Turkes</hi> Nauie doe offer to fight with vs: I muſt not thinke our Souldiers to bee by ſea any whit of leſſe diſcretion, courage and felicitie then vpon the land: for I make cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine accompt of their victorie. But admit theſe barbarous people purpoſing onely to trye our men ſhould fight neere to their aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and then hauing loſt twentie or thirtie gallies ſhould retire to the couert of their Townes and Caſtles: yet ſhould we ſo winne great fame and bee thought bolde that durſt aduenture to inuade them euen in the face of ſome of their Houlds. Then if any mans courage ſo encreaſed as needes he would to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> wee might tell him that beſides the reaſons afore named, we ſhould bée too farre of, and that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> armie will ſtill be as ſtrong as the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:8683:146"/>
Chriſtian. Againe, that although we had more fauourable ſucceſſe, yet were it too much preſumption to thinke at once to winne that proude Citie, without any armie by lande, within two hundred leagues thereof: as alſo that if they ſhould perceiue that wee would take that courſe, they would preſently thruſt in twentie thouſand Souldiers, and bring as many horſemen into the fielde to fauour it, all which they might raiſe in <hi>Natolie.</hi> And herevpon wee are to note that <hi>Mahumet</hi> the ſecond at the taking thereof beſieged it with two mightie armies, one by ſea, an other by land: the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians hauing at that tyme but fifteene or ſixteene thouſand men to defend it. But our beſt counſaile were to beſtowe the time vntill the ende of September in conquering of <hi>Moroca,</hi> inuading the ſame at the head, namely by <hi>Coron &amp; Modon,</hi> either by thoſe Caſtles that kéepe the mouth of the gulfe of <hi>Leganto,</hi> to the end afterward to fortifie it after our beſt maner at the falling of that peece of an Ile where the famous citie of <hi>Corinth</hi> was in olde time builded. The like enterpriſe made <hi>Andrew Dorie</hi> in the yeere 1532. who by force tooke <hi>Coron, Patras, &amp; Lepanto,</hi> places which were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward loſt againe for lacke of ſuccour. Hauing therefore left a ſtrong garriſon of footmen in the conquered places, ſeuen or eight hundred horſes, and prouiſion of victualles ſufficient with thirtie gallies, whoſe ſlaues might ſerue for Pyoners, the reſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie might bee diſmiſſed vntill the ſpring. Theſe through Gods great fauour might be the effects of the firſt yeere.</p>
               <p>Now are we to diſcourſe of the effects of the ſecond yere, when <note place="margin">The continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the warre in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond yere with the order to be taken as well by ſea as by lande.</note> I thinke wee ſhould not finde the <hi>Turke</hi> ſo proude as before: but much more warie and aduiſed: for experience teacheth thoſe things which otherwiſe we neither would nor could knowe. The armies ſhould be readie to march in the beginning of May, with like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againe to come to battaile if the <hi>Turkes</hi> would offer it. But if they liſt to take a ſurer courſe and not to attempt any thing out of ſeaſon, then muſt the Captaines ſhewe forth their braue polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, whereby to force them to the combate without their Houlds, as <hi>Hanniball</hi> did, who by ſubteltie drewe the <hi>Romaines</hi> to three battailes, which he wonne ſoone after his ariuall in <hi>Italy.</hi> The moſt ordinary meanes to be practiſed to that entent, is to beſiege places of importance: for if this mooue not the enemie to hazard himſelfe, it is a ſigne of ſmall courage and leſſe force. I doubt not but into thoſe which they minde to vſe to delay vs withall, they will put 8. or 10000. Souldiers, well victualled and furniſhed with all ſortes

And to ſay the truth ſuch exployts will bee difficult, chiefly for any towne ſtanding vpon this great Riuer: But that muſt bee no let but that we proceede and with plentie of Pyoners, and inſtruments enowe to ſet teme thouſand men on worke, we raiſe trenches both offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue and deſenſiur, and builde as many Fortes as may bee requiſite for the more conuenient aſſaulting of the beſieged, and ſafe defence againſt the enemies armie, vſing withall whatſoeuer our bridges. And I think certainely that vp planting fiftie Canons before ſuch places as may be but weakely fortified, we ſhall in fower daies ſee breach ſufficient for a horſe to goe in at. Then comming to haudie blowes with them, wee being ſtrong and they weake, and withall hauing the aduantage of the qualitie and goodneſſe of our armour, may eaſely he we them in peeces, vnleſſe Chriſtian courteſie liſt to ſpare any. During theſe actions it will ſtande our horſemen on hande to bee very watchfull, in going to ſafeconduct the bictuall and forrage: wherein may bee braue enterpriſes, and either parte may lay great ambuſhes, to trye the ſufficiencie of the Captaines, together with the baliancie of the younger ſorte.

               <p>The third yeere comining on, I thinke the like cheerefulneſſe <note place="margin">Of the exploits and behauiors of both the Chriſtian ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the third yeare.</note> as had moued ſo many braue warriers to employe themſelues in the two former, would ſtill bee of like force in them. And albeit the enemies Iron, their owne paſſed labours and ſickneſſe ſhall haue taken ſome away, yet many other, who hetherto ſhall not haue ſtirred from home, being deſirous to perticipate in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon commendation, would goe to ſupplye the emptie roumes, ſo as there would bee no want of men. The tyme to take the fielde thus drawing on, the armie by land hauing paſſed <hi>Draue,</hi> ſhould march to the riuer of <hi>Saue,</hi> whether it is not paſt twentie <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> leagues: here doe I not thinke that the barbarous people will meete with them in groſſe by the way, but rather employe their whole ſtudies and endeuours to ſtoppe their paſſages ouer the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, which is ſuch an aduantage as (being good Captaines) they will preuaile of. Uppon thoſe tearmes may a man ſee on both ſides the practiſe of all ſortes of braue pollicies and inuentions. But becauſe experience hath alwaies taught that a mightie ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer can hardly bridle a mightie armie (for if they can not paſſe vnder the fauour of ſome commodious place together with their Artillerie; they will doe it by ſubteltie, dallying in one parte

while they caſt their bridges and doing their endeuours in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) I will ſpeake no more thereof, ſauing that I am perſwaded that they may compaſſe it in eight daies.

                  </gap>, in my opinion, of greater difficultie then this. For beſides that wee ſhall finde the-towne well prouided for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, wee muſt alſo haue an eſpeciall eye to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> armie, which will not bee farre of: keepe ſome great bridge vpon <hi>Saue:</hi> haue an other paſſage on the ſide of <hi>Danowe:</hi> make Fortes and Trenches: and goe ſafely on forraging with conducts, ſo as the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it were a notable peece of worke. And to iudge thereof, may wee not boldly ſay that thoſe that are accuſtomed to conquer, will ſurmount all theſe difficulties: This place once wonne, muſt ſpeedily bee repayred and a ſtrong garriſon left therein: as being the moſt conuenient place to eſtabliſh a great ſtorehouſe wherein to gather all neceſſarie prouiſion. There about doe there fall three great riuers not farre aſunder into <hi>Danowe:</hi> namely <hi>Draue, Saue, and Tibiſe,</hi> which ſpringeth about the borders of <hi>Tranſiluania,</hi> which are as great at the <hi>Rhine or Menſe,</hi> By theſe fower cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels might wee bring all commodities, in caſe wee firſt take order that the <hi>Turkes</hi> remayning in ſome places in the harte of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie moleſt not the boates. Alſo becauſe wee ſhall not haue ſpent paſt halfe the yere, the reſt may be employed in driuing them forth, which peraduenture may be eaſely done.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus ſpoken of the exployts of the land power, we muſt <note place="margin">The exployts of the nauy.</note> likewiſe ſay ſomewhat of the Nauie, which in the beginning of May ſhould make ſaile toward the conquered <hi>Ile of Negroponte:</hi> where if the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> were deſirous of battaile, it ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed: but if it would not aduenture, but lye in waite for good opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie, the beſt deuiſe were to ſurpriſe and force the towne of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nike,</hi> in olde tyme called <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> which is in the borders of <hi>Macedon</hi> vpon the ſea coaſt, and being but weake might ſoone bée wonne. Then by all meanes poſſible to deuiſe how to make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible, becauſe it were good there to leaue a ſtrong garriſon both of footmen and horſemen to ſcoure the countrie. Here it is to bée noted, that whatſoeuer were to bee left in the conquered Houlds ſhould bee an ouerplus of men aboue the number: for the armies both by ſea and land ſhould ſtill retayne their number furniſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as is preſcribed, to the ende to bee alwaies prepared to the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:8683:148"/>
battaile. Wee might as well haue enterpriſed vpon the coaſtes of <hi>Sclauonia,</hi> where the <hi>Turkes</hi> doe keepe many townes, but by ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vpon theſe, which are more eaſie to be taken, we ſhall come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them, and ſo make them thinke as well vpon flight as fight. Hauing thus ſoiourned there one moneth or two, it might ſcoure the Iles of the maine ſea, as well to the ende to ſacke all the <hi>Turks</hi> there to bee found, as alſo to aſſure the Chriſtian enhabitants. It may bee the <hi>Turkes</hi> fearing the firſt heate of the Chriſtians, may ſuffer our armie to trye it ſelfe two or three moneths in the ſiedges of Forts, and then while they be al occupied about ſome one place, to come vpon them freſh and luſtely as they did at <hi>Gerbes</hi> where the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> forces were defeated: for the which the <hi>Spanyards</hi> likewiſe toward the ende of the ſiedge of <hi>Malta</hi> in parte requited them and ouerthrewe fiue or ſixe thouſand <hi>Turkes.</hi> For this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience I hope the Captaines will well enough prouide for being ſurpriſed: and before our armie withdrawe to their winte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, it were good to leaue fortie gallies in the Ile of <hi>Candy,</hi> there to bée readie vpon neede. In the winter time likewiſe it were not amiſſe on the edge of <hi>Hungary</hi> to deale with the <hi>Walachians</hi> and <hi>Moldanians,</hi> the <hi>Turkes</hi> ſubiects, though his great enemies, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their remembrance of the iniuries and miſchiefes lately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon them, to procure them to riſe againſt them, and to ſend ſome choyſe of men waged to ioyne with the Chriſtian forces, or to worke any other profitable commotions. As for the <hi>Tranſilua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> the <hi>Turkes</hi> tributaries, they will alſo be eaſely ſtirred vp: ſo as this ſupplye would ſtande vs in great ſteade to withſtande the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> if peraduenture the <hi>Turkes</hi> ſhould procure them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade Chriſtendome, to the ende to turne away our power from them. For 50000. Duckats by moneth they can cauſe 50000. horſemen to march, who as Graſhoppers doe make innumerable waſte. It were good alſo at the ſame tyme to practiſe with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Greece</hi> to declare themſelues at the next ſpring, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhould ſee the armies both by land and ſea ſet forward, and ſo fall vpon the <hi>Turkes</hi> ſcattered and dwelling in thoſe Prouinces.</p>
               <p>The effects of the fourth yeere which wee haue appoynted for <note place="margin">Of the exployts and effects of both the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the fourth and laſt yere of their warres againſt the Turkes.</note> the ende of this glorious conqueſt, ſhould be more notable then the former: wherefore it were moſt expedient that the good vnion of the Princes ſhould continue, leaſt neceſſary prouiſion ſhould fayle. Neither is it likely but it ſhould perſeuer, conſidering that proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie hauing alwaies accompanied theſe enterpriſes, euery man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:8683:149"/>
with hope would ſtraine himſelf to attaine to the wiſhed ende. With greater courage therefore and the ſame men of other yeeres ſhould the whole armie by land take the fielde more tymely then aforetyme. At <hi>Belgrade</hi> ſhould there bee alreadie prouided plentie of munition for the Artillerie, with a ſurpluſage of two thouſand horſe to performe the furniture therof, and three hundred Chariots for victuals at the leaſt: for going from thence they muſt giue ouer the riuers. Thus ſhould they march to performe their worke toward the towne of <hi>Sophy,</hi> which is the beginning of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie:</hi> for that doe the Cardes ſhewe to bee the direct way to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> not paſt two hundred french leagues therfro. It ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in a plaine and is vnfortified. It is likely the <hi>Turkes</hi> will not there make their head, but hauing gotten out the enhabitants, and either conſumed or tranſported the victuals, that they will leaue quite emptie and goe to <hi>Philippopoli,</hi> there to make vp their whole campe. The ſame is a towne of <hi>Thrace,</hi> &amp; famous through the battaile that <hi>Brutus and Caſsius</hi> there loſt. It ſtandeth in a fruitfull ſoyle vppon a ſmall hill, at the foote whereof runneth a ſmall riuer ſcarce wadeable. This were a fit place and well choſen to make great reſiſtance, yea and to hazard a fielde: for it is not ſo neere their Empire that by the loſſe of a fielde they may being in feares bee preuented, neither ſo farre of but that they may, if For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſo farre frowne vpon them, there gather vp good relliques of their armie: wherefore I ſuppoſe they will fight there, yea and their Emperour came thether in perſon: And how can he ſuffer vs to inuade him euen to his denne and not defend himſelfe after the examples of the nobleſt beaſtes? Albeit alſo that this nation bee repleniſhed with al vniuſtice and crueltie, yet are they withall fierce and hardie, and ſuch as make great accompt of their reputation. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> likewiſe ſhould haue matter whereon to encreaſe their hope, conſidering there are no more great Riuers or ſtrong Houldes before they come to <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> their onely hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance will bee a mightie armie to reſiſt them, whereat valiant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons doe reioyce: neither is there any other thing that troubleth them but when they are forced to fight againſt <hi>Hunger, Thirſt, Sickneſſe, great heate or extreme colde,</hi> becauſe there is no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue but may be ſuppreſſed by ſuch inconueniences.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chriſtian</hi> armie may, as I ſuppoſe, ariue at <hi>Philippopoli</hi> about the middeſt of June, where if the <hi>Turkes</hi> ſhould be entren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and lodged in any ground of aduantage, it will be hard pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:8683:149"/>
of them foorth: But becauſe they haue neuer vſed ſo to doe, eſpecially their Emperour being preſent, I will rather preſume that they wil after their wonted maner come bouldly into the field, as did the firſt <hi>Baiazet</hi> againſt <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> notwithſtanding his armie were innumerable. I thinke the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> power would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount vnto 220000. men, and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to foureſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand: for ſome muſt haue bene left in the laſt warres in garriſons, and ſome to ſafeconduct victualles, &amp;c. And I dare aſſure that as well the one parte as the other will bee well bent to ouercome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this battaile ſhould bee as it were a definitiue ſentnce of the whole warre. Of the order I will not ſpeake, for if the ſame which I haue before preſcribed bee not good, they may deuiſe of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and there referre the euent to God, who (as wee are to hope) will fauour thoſe that worſhippe him, againſt ſuch as doe diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor him.</p>
               <p>When I conſider with my ſelfe of this great warre and ſtately <note place="margin">Of what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance this warre againſt the Turke is in reſpect of all other warres.</note> armies, and conferre them with our ſmall ones in theſe partes, I remember the aunſwer of <hi>Alexander to Antipater,</hi> whom he left in <hi>Macedonia</hi> at his going to the conqueſt of <hi>Aſia. Antipater</hi> wrote vnto him that certaine of his enemies were riſen againſt him and had alreadie brought into the fielde tenne or twelue thouſand men, and therefore did deſire him to ſende him ſuccour: he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him this aunſwer: <hi>All your ſmall warres in Macedonia, now that I fight againſt the mightie armies of Daryus, and am conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the great Empire of Aſia, doe ſeeme vnto me to bee battailes betweene Cattes and Rattes, and therefore reſiſt them as well as you may.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some man may ſay, that ſometime in our ciuill warres we may note ſome braue martiall exploytes, albeit with ſmall power, as at the battailes of <hi>Dreux, S. Denis, Montcontour</hi> fought in <hi>France,</hi> with the ſiedges of <hi>Roan</hi> and <hi>Rochell:</hi> alſo ſeuen or eight great ouerthrowes in <hi>Flanders,</hi> with the ſiedges of <hi>Harlem, Maiſtrict, Tournay and Oudenard:</hi> I graunt it: howbeit they are no whit to be compared to the battaile of <hi>Lepanto</hi> which <hi>D. Iohn</hi> wonne. As alſo I beléeue the ſiedge of <hi>Malta</hi> which withſtoode foure ſcore thouſand Canon ſhot, and that of <hi>Nicoſia</hi> in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which as ſome write bare out fifteene, are to be preferred before the afore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged. The wars againſt Infidels are the ſame which our braue Captaines &amp; ſouldiers ought to ſeeke 100. leagues of, where they ought likewiſe to flee 50. from the ciuill, which by their continuall
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:8683:150"/>
courſe doe deuoure and conſume, and that with ſmall huſbandrie the flower of kingdomes and Commonwelths.</p>
               <p>I neede not to deſeribe the maner of this great battaile, for wee muſt imagine that in the former conflicts were neuer ſeene ſuch <note place="margin">Of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal battaile againſt the Turkes.</note> ſtomackes or ſo furious charges. To be briefe, after three howers fight I ſuppoſe they will leaue vs but a bloodie victorie: But ſuch as may there periſh, ſhall build to themſelues more honorable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers than thoſe that are purchaſed by perticuler quarels, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſoules doe for the moſt parte encurre ſhipwracke. In this caſe ſhall their deſire be iuſt, and their cauſe good, both which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned with that excellent courage that many ſhall haue here ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, will breede perpetuall renowme, which ſhall yet crowne the poſteritie of noble perſons that ſtill may remayne. The <hi>Turkes</hi> thus ouerthrowne and their campe ſpoyled, wee ſhall bée driuen to ſoiourne eight or tenne daies at <hi>Philippopoli,</hi> which after this great loſſe would make no reſiſtance, to reſt our ſelues and prouide for the wounded: and there were it requiſite to hazard ſundrie <hi>Greekes</hi> ſeuerally to goe to carie newes of this good ſucceſſe to <hi>Salonike,</hi> as alſo to ſende the Nauie worde, to the ende the ſame might drawe toward <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> for it were hard to beſiedge it without both the powers togethers. The <hi>Turkes</hi> loſſe in this battaile cannot bee ſuch but he ſhall ſaue 130000. men, of whome ſome may ſcatter ouer the countrie to ſee to the preſeruation of their families which they may haue left ſo abroade, but the great bodie will drawe toward <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with their Emperour, there to make their laſt reſiſtance, for in the plaine fielde dare they ſhewe themſelues no more. Becauſe alſo the towne is nothing ſtrong, we muſt imagine they would with all diligence raiſe forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of earth, make their planes, &amp; erect their ſpurres to plant their Artillerie vpon: All the victuall alſo there about would they take into the towne, leauing for the defence thereof at the leaſt fortie thouſand men: but for their great Lord, it is to be preſumed that he would paſſe forward into <hi>Natolia,</hi> which is the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> with all his treaſure and Concubines, there to prouide for newe ſuccour.</p>
               <p>Our power by land according as they could make their prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, <note place="margin">The following of the victorie.</note> ſhould by little and little ſet forward, leauing a ſufficient garriſon in <hi>Philippopoli</hi> to keepe the waies. Thence ſhould it paſſe to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> a great Citie, which being very weak, would neuer make reſiſtance: where alſo it were good to leaue ſome gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:8683:150"/>
and there to lay vp whatſoeuer victualles might bee gotten, wherof, through diligence we ſhould neuer want. This order were likewiſe to be obſerued, That the Souldier ſhould neuer ſpoyle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> nation: alſo that all Chriſtians ſhould bee exempt from pillage and ſeruitude: ſo would they bring you in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals from fiftie leagues about. Alſo good order and ſeuere iuſtice ought to bee eſtabliſhed in great armies, otherwiſe through the multitude of wicked and vnthriftie perſons all would runne into confuſion, were not their mallice by ſuch meanes brideled and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. During three or fower daies reſt at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> wee muſt cauſe our Nauie to ſet forward, whereto, hearing of this good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe it will not be very ſlack. It ſhould draw toward the ſtraights of <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> where it is likely the <hi>Turkes</hi> remembring their loſſes and not willing raſhly to hazard, vſing the aduantage of the place, will ſettle themſelues to fight, where they may bee flancked with the artillerie of the Caſtles: beſides that they ſhall haue that commoditie that they cannot bee aſſailed without fower ſcore or an hundred gallies in front.</p>
               <p>The firſt day that our armie ſhould ſhewe it ſelfe to the enemie <note place="margin">The exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

In the euening they ſhould take counſaile, and the expert Marriners to giue their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions how to attempt nothing out of ſeaſon. Finally, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines ſhould reſolue to land ſome of their men and artillerie on the ſide of <hi>Europe</hi> to beate and take ſome one of the Caſtles, to the ende to diſplace the <hi>Turkes</hi> from this aduantage: conſidering they ſhall there finde but fower or fiue hundred horſe on that ſide, where on the ſide of Aſia they ſhall meete with aboue two thouſand. By breake of day they muſt put forth fower thouſand Corcelets, ſixe thouſand Harquebuziers, and thirtie Canons out of the gallies, landed by the forſats or gallie ſlaues. While they ſhal thus march, the enemies horſe will come to prouoke them, but the number of Muſket ſhot ſhall ſcatter them well enough: So ſoone as night is come they ſhall make their approaches to the fortereſſe and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie bring planted, they ſhall by breake of day fall to beating of it. This will make the <hi>Turkes</hi> to prouide to bring vppon them twentie thouſand men to cut them in péeces: or els with ſome 150. gallies to inuade our Nauie there to doe the like, ſith they ſhall finde it vnfurniſhed. But the <hi>Turkes</hi> liking beſt of this ſecond
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:8683:151"/>
counſaile, will ſeeke to put in execution. Which our armie percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, they muſt goe on halfe the way with their furniſhed gallies, which may bee about two hundred, and ſo each armie deuided into three parts to ioyne bouldly: but after a long houres fight our men hauing the victorie, ſcarce the third parte of the enemies gallies ſhall ſaue themſelues. The ſame tyme alſo may the Caſtle that our men ſhal haue beſiedged, after the brunt of a furious aſſault be taken. Thus ſhould wée become maiſters of this proude paſſage where <hi>Xerxes</hi> built a wonderfull bridge of veſſelles, and ſuch as ſhall bée eſcaped, amounting to ſome one hundred gallies, may ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the newes of their miſhappe to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Our men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing then ſoiourned there fiue or ſixe daies, as well to prouide for their wounded, as to take the other Caſtle, hauing put good gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons into both ſhall take the way to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where they may ariue within two daies after the armie by lande. Then on both ſides knowing of the arriuall of their long looked for and victorious forces, it is not to bee demaunded what ioyes there will be.</p>
               <p>But wee may in trueth affirme this laſt deede to bée more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult then the reſt. For a battaile, though well fought is but one <note place="margin">Of the ſiege, aſſaults and taking of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</note> daies worke, whereas the forcing of ſo many men, couered with rampiers and prouided of all prouiſion to be atchieued in two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, is a teſtimonie of the experience of the Captaines and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancie of the Souldiers. The land armie being come within two leagues of the towne, the beſt Captaines with 20000. horſe and 7. or 8000. Harquebuziers ſhould goe within halfe a league therof to diſcouer the lodgings, and well to conſider what may anoye or empeach their ſafetie. Neither is it to bee doubted but they may thereby growe to a hot ſkirmiſh: for the <hi>Turkes</hi> being ſo ſtrong in the towne will ſhewe their couragies and ſmall aſtoniſhment. The next day they ſhall come to take their lodgings betime, and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh themſelues with ſome ſleight trenches at the head and middeſt of the flanckes. To the ende alſo the Nauie may conferre with the land power, and ſafely ſende their prouiſions, it will bee good at euery thouſand ſteppes to make ſmall fortes with trenches for the ſafetie of the paſſages from the ſea, about which workes both the Pyoners and the moſt parte of the Souldiers may labour 7. or 8. daies. This done, they ſhould goe neerer to diſcouer the towne, whereon they muſt ſtay at the leaſt fower or fiue daies: for my ſelf haue ordinarily ſeene that of haſty and raſh diſcoueries haue enſued
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:8683:151"/>
great ouerſights. Now muſt wee looke what way will bee beſt to giue the aſſault, which I would wiſh to doe but in one place: for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating the armie the garde of the trenches may proue too weake, and ſo not bee able to beare their ſailies. I would not thinke it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe to place 6000. Corcelets, and as many Harquebuziers at the leaſt, with 3000. horſe vpon the flanckes in ſome place vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, hauing alſo the whole bodie of the armie to ſupport them, which ſhould not be aboue a Canonſhot of. The firſt trench ſhould bee made a thouſand paces from the Campe in forme defenſiue, with conuenient flanckers, and two long wings of fiue or ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces ſtretching toward the campe: alſo to the ende not to be eaſely enuironed behinde by any ſudden ſailie, it ſhould bee made large enough to take 10000. men. The ſecond ſhould come within 500. paces of the towne, in forme offenſiue, &amp; at euery 100. paces ſome ſmall circuite of Gabions for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Enſignes to retire into, with a ſtrong guard where they may fight a whole quarter of an houre. Within 20. paces farther they ſhould place 25. Canons on three Gabions to ſhoote at the defences, the ſame to be defended by day with the harquebuzery of the trenches, and by night by ſome ſmall defenſiue trench on each ſide. Now thinke ye how many of their peeces may be diſmounted in 5. or 6. daies from of their new forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications made in haſt. In this ſiedge it will be requiſite to procéed with all diligence and force: for when they giue a mightie people time, the ſame doth in one moneth build a newe towne, hauing to worke but the length of 500. paces. Being once ſure of the artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie within, they ſhould begin to make the great batterie, bringing their peeces within 200. paces of the wall, and there planting them with all poſſible aſſurance, they ſhould make but two brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, howbeit thoſe to bee both large and reaſonable, wherevpon fiftie Canons aſſiſted with the fauour of ten long Culuerings ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing plaide ſome ſixe daies, it is likely that the horſes may paſſe. I will not ſpeake of their ſaillies, ſkirmiſhes and other kindes of combats ordinarily to bee performed, as being generally better to bee imagined then perticulerly foreſeene. Then ought the olde to giue counſaile: the young to aduenture: and thoſe of middle age to preſerue: In ſomme, euery man ſhould looke for a ſhare in the well doing. By Sea likewiſe other enterpriſes as well great as ſmall wherewith to ſurpriſe were to bee delt in, in ſuch ſorte as this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and bloodie tragedie might bee beautified with the diuerſitie of ſo many newe actions.</p>

In as much alſo as great numbers of the Turkes may bee retired into ſundrie townes in the inwarde parte of the lande, it were good to ſend two armies, each conſiſting of fifteene thouſand men, with artillerie conuenient to ſcoure the ſame.

               <p>Theſe things thus executed, it were good (as is ſayde in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning) <note place="margin">Partition of the Conqueſt.</note> to looke to the partition of the lande that ſhall haue beene conquered: and according to the expenſes of each Prince and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth in theſe conqueſts, to adiudge to them theyr iuſt deſert.

And in caſe all Chriſtian Princes had not ſo many controuerſies among themſelues, and withal would haue taken more compaſſion of the miſeries of thoſe that reclayme the name of Jeſus Chriſt, long ſince had wee brooken off halfe the ſcorges which doe nowe ſtrike vs. This warre would breede no remorſe of conſcience, neyther ſhoulde wee ſee the miſchiefes and confuſions wherewith ours are repleniſhed: but euerie thing woulde bee guided by martiall orders: and puniſhmentes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes miniſtred according to reaſon.

The onely faulte why it is not put in practiſe, reſteth in the Kings, Princes and Potentates that beare ſoueraigne dominion ouer the people, and much more profitable and honourable would it bee vnto them, than to ſtand quarrelling with their neighbours, or to ſuffer ſo much of their ſubiects bloud to be ſhedde vnder coulour of pietie, and ſo make their warres domeſticall and perpetuall.

               <p>I haue hard ſome of them diſcourſe in this manner. <hi>There haue bene</hi> (ſay ſome of them) <hi>in time paſt ſundrie learned perſons as <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius Trimegiſtus, Geber,</hi> and diuerſe Arabians, that haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their time in the conſideration of both naturall and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, who in their bookes haue left written diuerſe goodly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions concerning the Philoſophers ſtone or pouder of proiection, which is of ſo wonderful a vertue, that albeit their ſpeeches be verie darke, yet are they of ſuch ſort, that ſundrie excellent wits haue ſince vnderſtood them, &amp; plainly expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded their higheſt conceits, in putting in practiſe that which others haue bene content to ſee into by ſpeculation: for both theſe conioyned they haue by ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry proofes deliuered to the view of the ſenſe that which in old time was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded only in imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence haue proceeded the diſcouerie of wonderfull ſecrets.</hi> Truly theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches bere a goodly ſhew and are built vpon the authorities of very braue perſonages, which theſe puffing bellowes do diligently note, to the end to ſet the better gloſſe vpon their merchandiſe. Neither can I tell whether I dare alledge that which one of their learned Alcumiſts did on a time tell me, namely, <hi>That they were the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes of their ſect:</hi> but I referre my ſelfe to the truth thereof. Now if the conſiderations of antiquitie haue ben able as ſparkles to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in their hearts the deſire which wee ſee doth conſume them, the receites and books written in our dayes of the like argument can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but haue greatly increaſed the ſame, and experience moſt of all: in ſuch manner as ſome do ſeeme to be euen rauiſhed in diſcourſing vpon the excellencie of this art.</p>
               <p>Now will I proceed in the courſe of their reaſons which are as doe follow. <hi>That God hath not in vaine indued man with the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, which he hath giu him to the end to conſider of the greatnes and beautie of his diuine workes, and thereof reape ſo much fruite as ſhoulde bee vnto him permitted, that afterward he might yeeld to him all praiſe. That in time paſt he reuealed infinite, wonderful, and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar things: alwaies reſeruing to himſelfe neuertheles ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry new ſecrets to diſcloſe, by the varietie whereof the more to ſtirre vp euerie man to confeſſe that the abundance of his workes are incomprehenſible. That the Weſt Indies which ſeeme to incloſe the whole treſures of the earth, vntill, before vnknowen, were not diſcouered within theſe hundred yeeres. Likewiſe that in theſe later yeeres the art of tranſformation of vnperfect mettals into perfect, &amp; the multiplying of the quantity ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which barbarouſneſſe and ignoraunce had long buried, is as it were
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:8683:154"/>
reuiued agayne. Alſo that men haue learned with fire to drawe forth the eſſence of ſundry things, whereof they haue conpounded moſt ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne medicines as well to preſerue health, as to cure diſeaſes.</hi> By which ſpeeches it ſeemeth the Philoſophers ſtone to conſiſt in ſuch tranſmutation and multiplication: and this doe all the ſchollers of this arte together with their bookes affirme: A matter of ſufficient admiration, which alſo miniſtreth argument ſufficient to diſpute v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. But firſt I muſt declare ſome of their principles: They ſaie <note place="margin">Their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> that according to the opinions of ſundrie auncient Philoſophers, <hi>the earth hath in her bowels encloſed a certaine ſubſtance common to all mettalls, and apt to receiue whatſoeuer the conuenient formes of the ſame. Alſo that the ſayd ſubſtance warmed with a certaine heat, ſhut vp in the ſame earth; doth in long proceſſe of time purge and waxe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quide, afterward that it congealeth and groweth hard. Thus hauing by little and little in this ſlow generation loſt the vnperfect qualities, in the end it attaineth to this perfection, whereto nature laboureth to bring euerie thing.</hi> This is their opinion of the ingendering of met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; which fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnperfect do afterward grow to perfection: among the which Golde hath the firſt place, and Siluer the ſecond. Theſe foundations thus laide, ſome ſpeculatiue minds haue imagined that it is poſſible by art to imitate nature, &amp; firſt that the matter requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and neceſſary may be found: next; that euen in ſhort time, with artificial fire that thing may be made, which the earth is long about with her naturall heat. With theſe goodly perſwaſions haue many as well in times paſt as now, made infinit experiments whereby to finde, as the Prouerbe goeth, where the beane is hidden.</p>
               <p>Truly ſuch men are to bee commended as doe dedicate their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours <note place="margin">Their curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie examined.</note> to the ſearch of whatſoeuer may tende to the reliefe of mans life, and wherein we doe ſee the euident tokens of Gods wiſedome to ſhine: but withall it is verie requiſite that they which finde that agilitie in their minds, do not vndertake to enter ſo far into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of ſo many vnknowen ſecrets, vnleſſe for their guides they haue vpright iudgement &amp; diſcretion, leaſt wandring amiſſe they loſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues as many haue done, who through a deſire of knowing too much, being caried vpon the wings of their raſhneſſe &amp; ſoaring too high, haue fallen down headlong with <hi>Icarus.</hi> Experience hath taught y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many things haue ben inuented as ſoone as ſought for, as Printing &amp; Artillery, neither is there any me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were long in deuiſing.

                  </gap>it and conuenient to be tranſformed into perfect mettalls, which is the true ſeede that yeeldeth the Gold, and the ſame (as the principal ground whereon they muſt build) it is requiſite to know verie wel. That in time paſt few men knew it, but that nowe ſome excellent ſchollers in this art are nothing ignorant therein: alſo that it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not to be ſo ſtrange and vnknowen a thing, conſidering that euen meane men are perfect in the knowledge of the ſubſtance, ſeed and vertues of plants, hearbes, and foules. Like wiſe that albeit moſt of theſe goodly operations of nature bee hidden in the deapth of the earth, yet is mans ſpirit able to penetrate into ſuch ſecretes, ſith it can alſo mount aboue the heuens. To deny the ſubſtance that they ſearch for I dare not, becauſe wee ſee the effects: but to affirme that it is knowen, there reſteth the difficultie: for although wee knowe many, as the aforenamed, yet followeth it not thereof that wee are able to comprehend the other, which hath ſo long beene hidden, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte by the diſcourſe of our imagination, vntill experience hath taught vs the truth of this matter. Some common Alcumiſtes haue in their pamphlets gone about to deſcribe the ſaide ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. One aſſureth it to be quicke ſiluer or brimſtone: the other egges or bloud: and others haue named ſundrie other kinds, which haue procured a thouſand and a thouſand experiments, all which haue proued falſe. Some of them doe affirme that the true matter muſt of neceſſitie haue in it a great vegetatiue power, and ſome ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude with that ſubſtance whereinto it ſhoulde be tranſformed. Concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>, vegetatiue power theyr ſpeech doth ſtand with ſome reaſon for ſith nature muſt be an agent and worke in this action, the matter muſt likewiſe haue the ſame propertie, and not reſemble a ſtone or a peece of wood. As for the ſimilitude, it is likely alſo that the ſubſtance that ſhould yeeld Gold muſt haue ſome correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence therewith: for it were a plaine mockerie to imagine that an
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:8683:157"/>
egge ſhould bring forth a tree, or an acorne a bird. Theſe two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties then are verie neceſſarie for the matter which we ſpeake of: neuertheles by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> onely diſcourſing vpon things conuenient therto, it is not founde, no more than is the Philoſopers wiſedome, albeit they haue in their diſcourſes qualified and formed it.</p>
               <p>But admit I graunt, they knowe the true ſubſtance (which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe <note place="margin">Whether they can miniſter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny forme to the thing by them imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> is a deepe point) yet are they to proue by what artificial meanes, that is to ſaie, by what regiment or helpe they can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force their wiſhed forme, which is not eaſy to be done: for albeit that arte doe imitate nature, yea, that in ſome thinges it can euen helpe her, yet dare not our common <hi>Alcumiſts</hi> affirme, that it can growe equall with her. Heereto they replie that experience teacheth that the vertue of the arte, duelie fitted with the force of nature, doth ſo helpe it, that thereof inſueth the bringing forth of the kinds in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as Nature alone may haue brought them forth. As in <hi>Egges</hi> which are the ſubſtance whereof foules are bredd, a man may mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to them an arteficiall heat ſo temperate: either in an ouen or by other meanes, that wee ſhall ſee them yeeld forth the like foules as nature woulde haue ingendered: as alſo in the Salte pits wee ſee that arte together with the ſea water and helpe of the natural heate of the Sunne formeth the Salt. If therefore in liuing things, yea euen in dead things, it hath ſo much power, why may it not lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe worke in the ſubſtance of mettalls? Heereto I aunſwere, that this is but a bad kinde of arguing, of a few particular examples in things knowen to make a generall rule for thinges as it were yet vnknowen: for that which may agree with one cannot agree with many. Wee may eaſilie ſee that there is great difference betweene the manner by nature obſerued in the ingendering of mettals, and the other kindes afore noted. For hauing made the ſeede of plants, hearbes, and foules ſo common vnto vs, ſhe alſo ſheweth vs the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of their generation: But in mettalles it is another caſe, for if their ſubſtance hath bene hetherto as it were hidden, it is no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle that their procreation is vnknowen. Who ſo liſt to conſider how a Wheate kirnell bringeth forth a fayre and greate eare, ſhall neuertheleſſe therein ſee but ſmall helpe of arte, ſauing ſome tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle and tillage of the ground with the ſowing therof, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly be ſayde to be the principall cauſe of the generation: for it is onely nature, who hauing receiued the ſeed into the ground as into a matrix, doth heate &amp; putrifie it, alſo it maketh it to ſprout, growe, and take that forme whereto it is moſt proper. The lyke ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:8683:158"/>
is to be noted in the generation of mettals, which is performed by the onely vertue and power of nature, neither can art worke any great matter therein. And whoſoeuer ſhould take the ſubſtaunce of them out of their matrixe, wherein nature by hidden meanes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, weening through art to make perfect the ſaide mettalls, ſhall greatly deceiue himſelf: for ſo would it looſe the whole force and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come lame.</p>
               <p>This might the Empirical Alcumiſts haue therby learned by ſo <note place="margin">To what vſe experience may ſerue the Alchumiſts.</note> many their falſe experiments made ſo long time: which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les haue not yet vtterly diuerted their mindes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> promiſing to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſomwhat more: for they affirme that this pouder of proiection once performed, they may by caſting a little of it among a greate maſſe of imperfect mettals reduce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole into gold. Now thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thereto by degrees, ſaying that one once of this pouder is able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert a thouſand ounces of other mettal into gold: &amp; that which is better purified will conuert ten thouſand: but that which is once brought to perfection, will multiply, as they tearme it, from one waight to 100000. Theſe be the braue fruites which they make the trees of their garden to beare, whereof the leaſt wil be worth 9000 crownes, &amp; the greateſt about 900000. Truly if theſe effects were as true as the diſcourſes of them are braue, wee ſhall ſee many gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens giuen themſelues to the tilling of ſo fruitfull a ſoyle.</p>
               <p>The common opinion of man doth account this ſame to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious <note place="margin">The examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the multiplication of their pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> matter, yea, ſundry learned men do meruaile how ſo many can ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be lead away with ſuch perſuaſions, of whom if a man aſke how this great augmentation can come to paſſe, they will anſwere that that ſhould not ſeeme ſo ſtrange, conſidering that daily we ſee as great matter as that after the ſame manner: <hi>for</hi> (ſay they) <hi>ae candle once light is able to impart her light to 100000 more, &amp; yet neuer diminiſh it ſelfe one whit: ſo likewiſe the vertue of this power is ſo great, that it communicateth the ſelfe ſubſtance thereof to other mettals apt to receiue it.</hi> This ſimilitude, in my opinion, is no great proofe hereof: for the tranſmutation of a maſſe of Lead into a maſſe of Gold, which is a conuerſion of ſubſtance, doth far differ from mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring vnto fire any matter that may nouriſh or maintaine it. Yea, it doth better appeare in this, that the fire hauing conſumed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miniſtred, they both doe periſh: whereas by the alleadged tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation ſo perfect a mettall muſt come of it as may haue a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual being.

But almoſt all that treaſure did riſe of the ſpoyles and ouerthrowes of the <hi>Canaanites and Amorrheans,</hi> whom <hi>Dauid</hi> according to Gods appointment made an ende of rooting out. And as for <hi>Salomon,</hi> hee was a King endued with perfect wiſedome, but he neuer vſed the ſame to theyr pretended effects, yea, in the holie Bible we find whence he had his Golde and ſiluer. It is ſayde that his ſhippes ſayled with the ſhips of <hi>Hyram king of Tyre into Ophir,</hi> which ſome interprete to bee the <hi>Indies,</hi> to fetch and the number of Golde that they brought did mount to ſix hundred ſixtie and ſixe talents of gold.

But ſome of theſe men doe imagine that the gold of <hi>Ophir</hi> was the ſame that was fetched out of their fornaces, which impudent affirmation deſerueth no anſwer. But I will vſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Salomon</hi> to prooue their arte to be falſe: for if he whoſe wiſedome was incomparable, who alſo was perfect in all whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer coulde fall into mans capacity, neuer writ that he gate this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete by blowing: but contrariwiſe ſetteth downe ſome of the meanes whereby he attained to his wealth, ſhall not we preſume that it is an euident abuſe to leaue to their experiences? Neither is the example of <hi>Midas</hi> of any greater credit then the other. For in his perſon the ancient writers purpoſed to ſet before vs a couetous prince, whoſe treaſure through his owne vice grew hurtfull to him ſelfe. And by the golden fleece the poets ment the veynes of golde or ſiluer which the Greeke Princes fetcht out of <hi>Chalochos</hi> in the ſhip of <hi>Argos.</hi> Now let vs come to the <hi>Romaines.</hi> For it can not be denied but the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> ouerflowed with wealth: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it proceeded of the ſacking of all the world, and not elſe where, as teſtifie the hiſtories. The alleaging of great <hi>Coſme</hi> of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> is but a little tickling to cauſe vs to ſmile. For he was a man iſſued from a very wealthy family, and with all diſcreete, a great dealer and of muche traficke, whereby he mightily increaſed his goods, and afterward vſed very ſtately liberality and expenſes as did <hi>Lucullus</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Cimon</hi> at <hi>Athens.</hi> Concerning <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> king of <hi>England,</hi> who coined ſo many Roſe nobles, no hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie reporteth it to haue bene done with <hi>Raymond Lullyes phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical</hi> gold, which maketh me y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rather to thinke that he dealt with minerals.

noua, no man can denye but they were learned both in <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie and Alcumie,</hi> and found out great ſecretes: but I am aſſured that in any their bookes it cannot be found that the ſubſtance of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall gould doth reſemble the ſame whereupon our common <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumiſtes</hi> doe worke, either that the forme thereof is to bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in Fornances: beſides, if we conſider of their liues, wee ſhall in the ſame ſee the tokens of pouertie, and not of aboundance: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is likely they rather laboured to finde what were neceſſarie for the health of mens bodies, then to reueale any ſuch matter as might encreaſe their couetouſneſſe. Beſides, if either themſelues or any other had bene ſkilfull in this tranſmutation, I thinke they concealed it as well for their owne ſafeties and quietneſſe, as alſo to the ende to eſchue ſo many inconueniences as ſuch plentie of gould might haue engendred by falling into cruell and ambitious hands.</p>
               <p>I would therefore entreate thoſe that are ſo hot in the purſuite <note place="margin">Of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes wherin the Alcumiſtes doe plague themſelues.</note> of theſe crooked waies, to conſider how many ritch men haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe hundred yeeres beggered themſelues in theſe miſerable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments. May not ſo many ſhipwarackes reclaime them: but they muſt néedes runne headlong after their owne phantaſies: yea, they are ſo fleſhed in this buſineſſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it wil be fower tymes more worke to withdraw them therfro, then to fetch a Maſſing hedge prieſt out of a Tauerne: ſo as wee may ſay that in this arte there lyeth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hidden power which charmeth thoſe that doe exerciſe it. And it is likely that ſuch as ſo vehemently doe hunt after theſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie meanes, are thereto prouoked rather by their owne diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered affections, then by any well guided motions of the minde. As alſo we ſee that for puniſhment to their errors all their labours vaniſh in ſmoake. Neither is that all: for ſome finding themſelues in this extremitie doe coyne counterfaite money: others trot vp and downe to deceiue thoſe that are readie to beléeue their goodly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, which they make in ſeeking to catch them in the ſame ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Some man may ſay that euery one that giueth himſelfe to this ſcience doth not caſt away himſelfe, no nor take any harme thereby: for we ſee Lords and Princes that haue not ſould one Crownes worth of land for it, but are deſirous only to learne, as it were in ſport, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Truely he that could learne the goodly diſcourſes that they make to themſelues what they would doe when they had atchieued their purpoſe, ſhould ſee mounts and meruailes. One would be a King, and an other a Duke: One would make warres whereby to exalt himſelfe, an other would build Townes and Caſtles, and the moſt part would liue in pleaſures and ſuperfluitie. To be briefe, ſuch as are the affections, ſuch would the effects be. But I can neuer think that any ſecret can be reuealed to thoſe that beare ſo bad mindes.</p>

Were it not alſo an honeſt exerciſe for Lords and gentlemen, who loſe ſo much time, ſometimes to recreate themſelues in ſuch extractions, not of hearbes only, but alſo of minerals and other ſubſtances, out of the which they may draw ſuch oyle and vertue, that two or three drops thereof may profite more then a whole heape of Apoticarie drugges? How many other braue ſecrets may be found out by the vſe of fire, whereof euen the greateſt Princes ſhould not diſdaine to be ſkilfull? Diuers printed bookes doe ſhewe of things yéelding both admiration, delight and profite. He then that liſt thus to vſe this arte ſhall bee free from repentance thereof, whereto all thoſe are ſubiect which ſeeke to make it by ſtrange deuiſes to bring forth gould, which is as much as if a man for his owne appetite ſhould ſeeke to fetch <hi>Manna</hi> from heauen.</p>

                  <hi>the diſcipline of God and choſeth his workes: I preferred her before Kingdomes and Thrones: and in compariſon of her accompted riches to bee nothing, neither haue I compared the precious ſtone vnto her: for all gould is in reſpect of her but grauell, and ſiluer ſhall be eſteemed as durt. I haue loued her aboue health and beautie, and haue purpoſed to take her for my light: for her brightneſſe cannot be extinguiſhed: and all my goodes are come together with her, and wonderfull honeſtie through her hands. She teacheth ſobrietie, diſcretion, iuſtice and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which are things moſt profitable to the life of man. If any man couet after plentie of knowledge, ſhe knoweth things paſt, and iudgeth of ſuch as are to come: ſhe is ſkilfull in the depth of ſpeeches and ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of arguments, in the chaunge of maners, deuiſion of times, the courſe of the yeere and order of the ſtarres, in the natures of beaſtes, the ſtrength of the windes and the imaginations of men: in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of plants and vertues of rootes: and of her I haue learned all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete things, and thoſe that were neuer ſeene before: for wiſedome the workmiſtris of all things hath taught me: for her ſake I ſhall be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull in the preſence of the mightie, and the countenances of Princes ſhall meruaile at me.

this heauenly pouder ſhall doe? Betweene gould and mettall there is ſome affinitie and correſpondence: but betweene vice and vertue, ignorance and knowledge reſteth a manifeſt contrarietie: and yet is that the place wherein wiſedome doth worke, for it tranſformeth the wicked powers thereof into good, and as is aforeſayd, teacheth thoſe principall vertues which <hi>Cicero</hi> in his offices ſo highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolleth: But what man is ſo groſſe and ſenceleſſe, as to compare euen the greateſt maſſe of gould with the leaſt portion of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or iuſtice? <hi>Plato</hi> the Philoſopher ſaith, that if with our bodily eyes we could perceiue the beautie of vertue, we would be rauiſhed with perfect loue thereunto: But the vaile of pleaſure and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſo blindeth vs that we cannot ſee it. And I like well y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Solon,</hi> who preferred the felicitie of a poore citizen named <hi>Telus,</hi> that was endued with wiſedome and vertue, before the good hap of <hi>K.

Here muſt we ſtay, as hauing no neede to dilate vpon the ſayings of <hi>Salomon,</hi> conſidering how amplie he expreſſeth the benefites proceeding of wiſedome: &amp; ſith ſhe bringeth the knowledge of heauenly matters, humaine actions, &amp; naturall effects, &amp; withall giueth honor, riches, vertue, praiſe, health, mirth and fame, what can a man ſay more?</p>
               <p>Now, God imparteth not theſe benefies onely to the mightie: <note place="margin">How liberally God doth communitate this treaſure to all men: alſo the vſe and abuſe of the ſame.</note> for euen the meaneſt doe participate therein, ſome more and ſome leſſe, according as it pleaſeth him to endue them with this ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne cauſe: as being aſſured that the knowledge of Mechanicall artes, induſtrie of Merchants, and experience of labourers, are no other but the ſmall effects thereof, which doe alſo appeare in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the gouernment of ſmaller families, and temperance of the maners of the pooreſt. But who can make a better ſhewe of the brightneſſe of this light then the very diſcourſes of the <hi>Alcumiſts?</hi> For ſometimes they wade into the depth of the earth, then doe they conſider the operations of nature, &amp; ſometimes for the extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their arte they climbe euen to the ſpirituall ſubſtances: And what hath opened their eyes to knowe ſuch difficult matters but that wiſedome which after an excellent maner doth ſhine in their vnderſtandings?

Howbeit, ſith all men will not finde ſo much leiſure, this my ſmall labour ſhall ſupply the default of thoſe ſlothfull perſons: wherein they ſhall finde the flowers readie gathered, which are ſo ſweete as no filthie ſtench ſhall be able to offend them.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe we ſhall neede no perticuler marke to knowe theſe of <note place="margin">How they may be knowen.</note> whome wee ſpeake, for their owne ſpeech will bewray them as the fruite doth the tree: neither to note the places where to finde them: onely this ſhal ſuffice, that although they be ſcattered euery where, yet are there three principall fieldes wherin they do moſt proſper: <hi>the Court, the Armies, and the Townes:</hi> and ſo long as vertue was in eſtimation their number was but ſmall, but through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt thereof, they haue abounded. Neither is it any meruaile: for as thornes ſpring vp among Roſes, and darnell with wheate: ſo doth vice intrude it ſelfe where vertue doth, or ought moſt to ſhine, to the ende to blemiſh the ſame. Among the three ſortes of enhabitants in the places aforeſayd, wee may peraduenture finde ſome difference in their diſcon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:8683:165"/>
a Croſbow man, &amp; a Harquebuzier ſhooting all at one but, though with ſundrie Inſtruments, yet in intent doe agree.</p>
               <p>The Courtiers are very delicate in their ſpeeches and pleaſant <note place="margin">Of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures of the Court.</note> quippes, powring foorth their reaſons ſo ſweetly and with ſuch a facilitie that a man ſhall be catcht ere he be aware. Neither do their countenances or courteſies, which are great helpes to perſwaſion, any whit varie therefro. Thus with theſe goodly ſpeeches they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer whatſoeuer is vnperfect in their opinions, not that they thinke them vnperfect: for they doe followe them, wiſhing others alſo to embrace the ſame. The ordinarie life that is led in thoſe Courts that are alienated from vertue, is in parte the cauſe of encreaſe of corruption in theſe men: for ſéeing pleaſure ſo highly eſtéemed, they are the more enflamed to enioy the ſame: alſo through lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g cuſtome in wiſhing and plunging themſelues therein, they doe eſteeme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, and to the ſame ende doe referre all their actions. Thus by little and little of ſchollers they growe to be maiſters in an arte that draweth thoſe that put it in practiſe into deſtruction. Among theſe doe I not meane to place the vertuous Courtiers, whome I take to bee as vnlike vnto them as gould is to leade. But I wiſh only they were admoniſhed not to permit their puritie to be conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with others corruptions. Albeit we are not to thinke plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to bee ſuch an outward imperfection, as faſteneth hould vpon vs ſo ſoone as we come neere to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. For the ſeeds therof are in our ſelues, where they redily doe ſproot and fructifie according as they be hett by ſuch obiects as preſents themſelues to our ſences, vnleſſe by the power of reaſon they be reſtrayned. Whoſoeuer ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or councelleth a yong man to goe to the places afore mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to learne any thing, ought firſt to admoniſh him that there he ſhall finde fewe good men, but many bad: alſo that the firſt ſorte will coldly induce him to al honeſtie, but the latter will continually ſollicite him to whatſoeuer is vnhoneſt, ſo may he preuent the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and prouide to reſiſt the ſame. For theſe ſubtile doctors haue no better ſporte then to meete with ſuch game, whome they aſſure themſelues of, if they but once giue them the hearing. Howbeit, although they hate true vertue, yet doe they ſometimes in wordes commende it, to the ende to daunt none, but by their deedes they ſhewe that they doe not much regarde it, as hauing no care but to take their pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Their ordinarie ſpeeches to thoſe whom they ſeeke to drawe to <note place="margin">Their ſpeches to thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſeeke to ſeduce.</note> their opinion are theſe. <hi>Mans life is ſhorte and repleniſhed with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:8683:165"/>
troubleſome euents: we are not aware that it is at an ende before we knowe how to guide our ſelues to finde any comentation. For ſome led by common custume and others by ignorance, doe entangle them ſelues in diuers miſeries which they might wel auoyde, and ſo doe leaue behinde them many pleaſures which they ſcarce perceiue: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which mans life is a waightie burden to him: yea and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to nature who by her ſecrete motions procureth all liuing things to delight in their being, and to ſeeke after that which may delight them. That as among all other creatures, man is the moſt excellent, ſo hath he moſt priuiledges: whereof one of the principall conſiſteth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creating himſelfe in the beautie and varietie of whatſoeuer is ſcattered ouer the face of the earth. That his minde is capable to learne and comprehend: but it many times happeneth that all haue not like good happe to meete with good ſchooles: which are to be found in the courts of Princes and good townes, the principall ſeates of conuerſation, where the beſt poliſhed mindes do chooſe to enhabite: howbeit that the Court only beareth the name, as the place where not good inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s only are to be had, but alſo all ſortes of obiects that may delight doe make their reſidence. That the country man who keepeth home, ſpendeth his daies in hunting ſome beaſt, or in eating the wortes of his garden, where as thoſe that flow in aboundance doe continually be hould goodly things, heare al melodies, &amp; ſmell all good ſauors: yea if there be any ſweet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the world the ſame are with them to be found. Likewiſe that whatſoeuer may tende to the exerciſe or contentation of the minde, is there more plentifull, as delightfull companie, amitie, courteſie, honor, fauor, wealth, rewardes, offices, dignities, commendations, tryumphes and all magnificence. To be briefe, which way ſoeuer a man turne him ſelfe, all doe laugh and reioyce: Theſe are the things which wee ought to ſeeke in this life, to the ende to burie ſuch heauineſſe as happen ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by ſo many vnlooked for accidents: And whoſoeuer taketh any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe reſembleth the couetous perſon, which hauing (as a man may ſay) all felicitie in his coffers, cannot enioy it: but daylie encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his cares and miſeries: ſo farre are his ſences out of frame. That it is great folly to preſcribe to mans life (as many doe) ſuch ſtraight boundes to coope it in, as a man would doe a priſoner: for ſo doe they make it like vnto death, which is repugnant vnto nature: and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doe bring it into that ſtate. For we ſee ſome of theſe Protestants that make a conſcience to laugh: on the other ſide, the Charterhouſe Munke dare not ſpeake, and the Nunnes doe nothing but weepe. But if no man may without thoſe paſſions haue place in the chambers and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:8683:166"/>
ſtately halles of Paradize, they are well content to leaue the preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence vnto them, and for their partes to take ſome roume in the ſmall corners of the outer courts. That thoſe men are too ſpeculatiue with in regard of things to come, do ſet themſelues in the ſtockes in this world, and reiect ſo many preſent benefites which are not created but to bee vſed.</hi> Theſe are the ſhort ſermons which theſe good Courtiers doo preach in good and poliſhed ſpeeches vnto the nouices whom they purpoſe to entrappe: neither is it to be doubted but they be drawne by this <hi>Epicurian</hi> doctrine, which is in theſe latter daies very plauſible to many. All theſe wordes, with many more deliuered with a grace and dexteritie in the middeſt of theſe theatres of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, vnto thoſe ſimple ſoules that yet doe walke in the pathes of youthfull innocencie, are of wonderful force to reſtraine them from all good motions, and certainely the moſt part are ſhaken and infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſame. Wherefore it is neceſſarie in this our age to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh the veſſels of our ſoules with all good liquours, to the end thoſe that bee poyſoned and ſtill flowe in many places may finde no entrie. Here would I anſwer the propoſition of the falſe Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, were it not that wee muſt alſo ſuffer his companions to vtter their ſpeeches, which are not much different from him and tende both to one ende: and then aunſwer them both together.</p>
               <p>Now let vs bring vnto the ſtage the enhabitants of the townes. <note place="margin">Of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines which enhabit the Townes.</note> One ſorte termed the <hi>careleſſe children,</hi> which are a kinde of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that paſſe not their legge of mutton, their flagon of wine, and a game at ſcailes I will not ſpeake of: but I purpoſe to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other ſorte which want neither learning, eloquence, nor ciuilitie: men worthie continual conuerſation, were not their ſoules polluted with this vayne <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> which tyeth true felicitie to ſenſible and corporall things. They doe ſome what differ from the Courtier that ſpake before, for he doth not vtterly reiect labour, but delighteth in diuerſitie of actions, &amp; doth ſomewhat aſpire to high matters: wheras theſe men loue idleneſſe, which they terme <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie,</hi> ſeeking to eſchue all cauſes of griefe, which is one of the priucipal fruites of the <hi>Epicurian</hi> doctrine: who alſo doe diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerue the precept proceeded out of the ſame ſchoole: <hi>Hide thy life.</hi> Now ſome of them being learned doe eaſely, by the ſubtletie of their arguments, drawe to them many ſchollers. But their ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt meanes is the practiſe of the delicious life that they leade. For ſo ſoone as any haue once taſted of the liquorous morcels that it yeeldeth, it is a great aduenture, but he euen glutteth himſelfe: And
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:8683:166"/>
the better to induce him thereto, they drawe him in with theſe ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches following. <hi>That men for the moſt parte haue bene wrapped in ignorance, which is one of the chiefeſt diſeaſes of the ſoule: whereof it</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Their ſpeeches.</note> 
                  <hi>hath followed that many times they haue taken the falſe for the true: yea euen in the choyſe of the life that is beſt for them they haue bene greatly deceiued: but that thoſe whoſe mindes haue bene illuminated with the documents of Philoſophie, haue better perceiued what were good for them to chooſe. That in them they haue learned that among all temporall things ſubiect to the ſundrie blaſtes of fortune, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt are the ſafeſt. For proofe whereof, that wee ſee the higheſt towers and trees moſt beaten with thunder, likewiſe the loweſt medowes for the moſt parte drowned with great floodes: but that the meaneſt buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings are freeſt from all ſuch inconueniences. Euen ſo is it in mans life. For ſuch as trot after the greatneſſe therof are toſſed with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand paſſions, and oftentimes with ſudden destruction: On the other ſide, the meaneſt ſorte are ſubiect to many oppreſſions and iniuries: But thoſe that keepe the meane, doe without the enuie of the one ſorte and contempt of the other, beſt preſerue themſelues, and withall enioy a ſweete peace both in bodie and minde, which conſisteth in the vſe of all delectable things, and in the want of ſuch as may bee noyſome. That albeit they enhabite the great townes, where they may ſee a vehement flowing and ebbing of wordly folly yet doth not the ſame toſſe this out corner of the world, where their nauigation doth lye, and where it is almoſt alwaies calme, whence they behould the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all, and ſmile at the vaine hope and diſordered deſires of the one ſorte, and bewaile the ſimplicitie that circumuenteth the other, while in the meane time they let the world ſlide, which paſſing in her wonted courſe, moweth downe all that hath had being: wherefore the beſt counſaile that a man can take is to poſſeſſe himſelfe, and not to become a bondſlaue to diuers things, which to no purpoſe doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue him of that ſmall libertie that he hath, which alſo he ſhould make ſo deere accompt of. That it is not in vaine that this braue ſpeech, Too much of nothing hath bene had in ſo great reputation, as being a ſentence that cutteth off all exceſſe in humaine actions, and not onely the bad, but alſo thoſe which vnder colour of goodneſſe, doe tende to transformations againſt nature, ſuch as many ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to perſwade to themſelues, who but ſimplie conſidering of the weakeneſſe and frailtie of man, doe imagine that they can liue heere belowe as Angelles, and to the ende to attaine thereto, doe endeuour to binde themſelues to vnpoſſible rules and obſeruations,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:8683:167"/>
albeit their bodies be compoſed of the elements and ſubiect to the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that followe that ſubstance: but they weening to aduance them ſelues doe recoyle backward, as the hammer wherewith a man ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth too hard vpon aſlithie. For, ſay they, what els are ſo many ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious custumes, ſuch austerities, deuotions, and propounded feares, but rauiſhments of ioye and recreation whereto mans affections doe tende? adding, that in ſeeking to make it perfect, they make it vnſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, after the maner of the Stoikes, which is, to destroy their owne fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure: That the beſt way therefore is to followe the rules which agree with nature, who is to bee guided without violence and left free: alſo that who ſo vſeth it otherwiſe, burieth himſelfe before he bee dead, which is a puniſhment that thoſe men haue well deſerued that haue ſo badly vſed the goodly priuiledges of life.</hi> Theſe bee the firſt ſpeeches that they propound: and then when a man is growne into domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call familiaritie with them, they doe more at large diſcloſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes that before they durſt not reueale: For (as ſaith <hi>Plutarke,</hi> ſpeaking of ſuch <hi>Epicures)</hi> they feare the people, and for a ſhewe doe embrace the religion allowed, to the ende to bee tollerated, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in corners they ſcoffe thereat.</p>
               <p>Let vs now heare alſo thoſe that are brought vp in the warres, <note place="margin">Of Epicures and Libertines brought vp in the warres.</note> for now is it their turne to ſpeake. But firſt I will ſay thus much: that I meane not to condenme the lawfull profeſſions wherto men apply themſelues, but only ſuch corruptions as fall out. The great labours of theſe warriours, together with the daungers whereinto they haſard themſelues, do procure them earneſtly to long for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as a moſt ſweete medicine for their paynes: alſo to eſchue all ſorowfull obiects, as being but too much affrighted at the images of death which they ſee ſo often. And when they haue catched ſome good bootie, it is not to be demaunded whether they ſtudie to make good cheere: for both daies &amp; nights are too ſhort for them. And this prouerbe which by the ſcripture is applyed to prophane perſons, is vſually in their mouthes, <hi>Let vs eate drinke &amp; be merrie, for perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture to morow we ſhal dye.</hi> This is a cloſe approbation of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of the ſoule together with the bodie, which they will reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh with all earthly goods, for that they be ignorant of the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. When a yong gentleman co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to learne the feates of warre, they faſhion his ſoule after a terrible maner, if he cleaue too much to them. Their ſpeech is not ſo much painted as the former, but as it <note place="margin">Their ſpeeches.</note> were enterlaced and full of ieſting. <hi>The Souldiers</hi> (ſay they) <hi>muſt aime at both pray and pleaſure, and eſchue all melancholy, which they
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:8683:167"/>
returne to the couetous miſers and Hermites, for couetouſneſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion can haue no abiding with the ſouldiours, the one making them to hate, the other to feare: likewiſe that they muſt not feede delicatlie, for that quaileth their courages. To be briefe, that thoſe which minde to bring into the Theatres where Mars playeth her bloudie tragedies, faſtings, portuaiſes, &amp; contemplation, doe but put forth themſelues for mocking ſtockes, conſidering that there is nothing to be looked for but triumphs, rewards, and commendations, which are atchieued by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie waies.</hi> Theſe be the pettie rudiments of their ſchooles wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may perceiue how all three ſortes doe agree in the reiecting of pietie, which is the worthieſt and moſt precious ornament of our ſoules.</p>
               <p>I know ſuch wicked ſpeeches do deſerue to be buried in ſilence, <note place="margin">Why the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures are heere ſet downe: alſo the meanes to eſchue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the ſame.</note> alſo that neither the mouth of man ſhould vtter them, neither the paper beare them: but now other farre worſe are ſo common, that we need not to make any doubt of reuealing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo as we do it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the end to warne others to beware, &amp; to ſhew the meanes how. For as men ſet manifeſt markes in certaine places in the greate ſtreames where the rocks do lie hidden vnder water, that the ſailers may eſcape them, ſo hauing marked the places where theſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſhelues are harbored, I thought good to ſet downe ſome ſmal deſcription of their forme. Many there are who beeing ignorant of theſe dangers do thruſt through the middeſt them: and theſe are to be moaned as much as the others are to be blamed, who perceiuing them, doe ſeeme to haue a pleaſure to make ſhipwracke thereon, as taking their beginning to be verie ſweet, though the end be ſower. The beſt way to ſcape without ſcath, is to carry with them the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, that is, wiſedome, and the card, which are the goodly precepts to diſcerne the true from the falſe. For when the vaile that couered this falſe life is taken awaie, and that the filthineſſe thereof appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that man is verie beaſtly that immediatly flieth not from it for feare of polluting himſelfe in ſo filthie a puddle. We haue alreadie ſcene the beautifull ſhew of this vayle which ſhineth in the painted and ſweet ſpeeches of theſe teachers: and eſpecially in thoſe which they make to runne downe ſo ſweetely in the beginning: for men woulde thinke they ſhould bring them to heauen: but when they gather to theyr concluſions, they make a ſodayne ſtoppe, taking the waie not to anie pleaſant places of the earth, but euen to the darkeſt dens therin. And in the meane time their intermingling of the fayre with the foule, and of the good with the badde, doe dazell
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:8683:168"/>
the eyes of the ſimple, and dim their iudgements, wherby they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at the firſt perceiue their iutentes, which in deede they ſeeke to couer, becauſe they cannot catch the birdes without counterfaicing ſuch pleaſant calls.</p>
               <p>But leaſt we might be deceiued, it is not amiſſe to ſhew the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies of their intangling argumentes, reducing them into a more briefe and manifeſt forme.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Courtiers</hi> is this. <hi>The inſtructions of the Court, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the quiokeſt wits doe teach man to follow ſuch things as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But deuotion and the ſtraight rules of religion doe plunge it in 1000 anguiſhes, make it melancholy, and hinder it from attaining to this ende.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We muſt therefore reiect them, and enſue thoſe that bring more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond argument gathered out of the <hi>Epicures</hi> ſpeeche is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The beſt rules to mans lyfe are the naturall motions of the ſoule, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what holpen with the precepts of Philoſophie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the ſuperſtitions which tranſport man to imagined perfections, ſtrange to mans reaſon doe turne it out of this waie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are therefore rather to follow that which is according to nature, and conformeth it ſelfe thereto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſouldiers is this. <hi>Thoſe things that effeminate the mindes and daunt the courages of the ſouldiers, taking from them their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted cheerefulneſſe which they ought to haue, doe in no wiſe agree with their profeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the rules of religion which commend humilitie, forgetfulneſſe of iniuries, &amp; a feareful meditation of death, do work all theſe effects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They are therefore vnconuenient thereto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this abrigement of ſpeech we may (as I thinke) better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <note place="margin">The examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſmes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going.</note> the ſpeakers meaning, as ſeeing it naked and cleere from that which before kept it diſguiſed: neyther doe I ſuppoſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie man, pare deaie that theſe argument are grounded vpon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietis and intemperancie: for as well thoſe mennes purpoſes tend onelie to let goe the bridle to bodilie affections, to the ende to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe and glut themſelues in all pleaſure, and to reiect the lawes and admonitions that labour to reſtraine them within the boundes

of vertue. But if we doe more neerely marke their arguments, we ſhall ſee that all their concluſions are falſe, as alſo are the moſt part of their propoſitions, which muſt not ſeeme ſtraunge, becauſe that in the approbation of wickedneſſe wee cannot proceede but by falſehoode and lying.</p>
               <p>The principall thing that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> propound to dazell mens eies withal, is that all creatures doe long after whatſoeuer may reioyce them, and eſchue whatſoeuer may make them ſorrowfull.

In beaſts this appetite is ruled by certaine inſtinctions which nature hath giuen them, whereby they order themſelues: and vſually wee ſee them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome change this order: But man is indued with reaſon to guide his actions, whereto he yeeldeth verie ſmall obedience: which alſo albeit it were much greater than it is, yet could it not eſcape ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The doctrine of Philoſophers teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there bee three ſortes of good, <hi>The pleaſant, the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and the honeſt.</hi> Alſo that as the <hi>profitable</hi> are to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the <hi>pleaſant,</hi> ſo the <hi>honeſt</hi> are to bee eſteemed aboue them both, as farre exceeding them in all excellencie: and theſe doe properly pertaine to man, who onelie among all creatures is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of vertue.

               </p>
               <p>In the court we may ſee many who when their maiſter hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them any reward, doe neuer ceaſe praiſing of him, ſaying: O <hi>what a good maiſter we haue, that giueth vs ſuch rewards? Are wee not bound to loue him heartely, and withall fidelitie to ſerue him?</hi> If men can then ſo delight in the acknowledgement of humane bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, what are they to doe for diuine? Undoubtedly thoſe that bee well taught do delight much more in heauenly: for they know that a Prince loueth to day &amp; hateth to morow: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>God</hi> neuer hateth thoſe whom he hath regiſtred for his in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> booke of life, but loueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a moſt perfect loue.

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:8683:173"/>
that my prince fauoureth me, and I haue reported the trueth vnto him: eyther that hauing had wealth I haue releeued thoſe whome pouerty was ready to thruſt downe into their graues: will not all this be vnto me an occaſion of greater ioy then if I had vſed theſe commodities to hurt my enimies, to eate more delicate morſelles, or to be coſtly clothed all ouer to make men gaze vpon me, as vpon as vpon an Oxe crowned whom men vſe to leade vp and down the ſtreetes? I referre it to the iudgement of the wiſe. A Chriſtian ſhal alſo finde further occaſion to reioyce when by outward benefites as well his mind as body are freed from ſorrow &amp; ſufferance which proceede of the want of theſe goods: but this is with a moderate ioy which continueth and reſembleth a calme and ſtil running wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wheras the ioy of the Libertines doth rather reſemble the inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of a ſwift ſtreame.</p>
               <p>I dare affirme that euen the bodily pleaſures (I ſpeake of ſuch <note place="margin">That the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which the Chriſtians do enioie, are more delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and firme then thoſe wherin the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibertines doe plague them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</note> as are lawfull) which they ſo ſtorme for, are not ſo pleaſaunt vnto them as vnto thoſe whome they take to be ſo entangled in ſorowe. The firſt place will I attribute vnto thoſe which they receiue in taſte and feeling, which are the two ſenſes that they ſeeke ſooneſt to ſatiſfy, notwithſtanding nature hath placed them further from the vnderſtanding then the reſt, as thoſe which are moſt repugnaunt thereto. In this carrier doe I already perceiue ſome not only run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning but euen dying after one <hi>Flora</hi> or <hi>Lays:</hi> but in their ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, yea and enioyings, they ſhall hardly perſwade me that their pleaſures doe ſurmount their paynes: for if there be any purgatory in the worlde, a man may ſay that it is there. One cryeth out that he burneth, another that he freezeth: one will goe hang him-ſelfe, another will baniſh him-ſelfe: thus doe they pay beere for ſuch wares. Such loues wil ſome man ſay, do not pierce ſo violently: but I ſay yes. For vnchaſte flames doe burne, where the ſhame-faſte do but heate onely. Againe, after they haue enioyed their purpoſe, what followeth? two very contrary effectes, according to the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of humors. For we ſhal ſée ſome not to loue women, but euen to worſhip them as Goddeſſes, ſubmitting them-ſelues to ſuch vile bondage, that eaſily they growe moſte vilely to vnworthy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Is not this then a worthy pleaſure that maketh the ſoule ſo ſenceleſſe &amp; aſtonied? Others contrariwiſe, after they haue once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of this foode doe diſdayn it: not to the end to taſte no more, but to long after chaunge. Wherein they very well declare the vanity and ſhortneſſe of bodily delights. Yet is not the tragedy ended, the

miſchéefe whereof we may ſay to conſiſt in the Cataſtrophe. For moſt of thoſe that haue beſt played their parts do finde themſelues rewarded according to their works, namely with debility of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, gowtes, pockes, paines in the ſtomache, and which is more, their life is ſhortned and their hearts and mindes weakened. Theſe be the fruites that growe in this goodly garden of pleaſure which theſe our maſters doe ſo honor: where in the beginning they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a fewe roſes, but after they haue a while ſported them-ſelues, they ſtep before they be aware into a Laberinth of pricking thor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Theſe amities may alſo be tearmed the kirnelles, which bring forth the fayre &amp; great families, whoſe end is ordinarily crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with contentation.

The ſecond ſort are not ſo diſordinate as theſe, but do intertain themſelues with much more ciuilitie and deſicacy, and in liew of ſwallowing downe all that they eate &amp; drinke, they will onely taſte of it, to the end thereof to haue the longer delight before they be ſatiſfied. Theſe men be ſomewhat carefull to hide the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of dronkenneſſe, but moſt diligent to ſeeke meanes of diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all meats, that by ſuch varietie their appetites may find more delight.

Likewiſe we may ſee what gaine is to be gotten in ſeruing a maiſter that is ſo liberallin all kindes of ſorrowes to thoſe that chooſe to cleaue rather to their bellies than to abſtinencie. Farre other is the pleaſure of thoſe that doe moderatly vſe the gifts of <hi>God</hi> which he ſendeth for our ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. For taking the ſame in ſuch ſorte, their ſoules are neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered with abuſe of them: ſo that remaining free in the conduct of their ſenſualitie, they ſometime giue it the raines, and ſometime reſtraine it neither more nor leſſe, but as a man would doe when he walketh a young horſe in the fields.

               <p>By this that I haue ſaide, it appeareth that the vſe of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation</hi> is not tyed to that life only which ſeemeth to be who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vowed thereto: for there bee many <hi>Monckes</hi> that fall to ryot, and many <hi>Artificers</hi> which contemplate: and without this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite which fewe ſeeke to enioye, humaïne miſeries and continuall cares would take from vs the greateſt parte of that felicitie which we labour for. This may be a beginning of aunſwer to the afore alleadged opinions: for in my mind it is more auaileable to declare what this contemplatiue power is and the true obiects thereof, to the ende wee may the better knowe how to helpe our ſelues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and the neede that we haue thereof.</p>
               <p>The reaſonable ſoule (to ſpeake familierly) conſiſteth of two partes: the one which is exerciſed in the baſe things of this world, <note place="margin">Of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue power and the true ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects thereof.</note> which being in maner innumerable may happen after ſundrie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions in reſpect of the mutabilitie of the ſubſtances, varietie of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, affections and operations of men: And they which beare themſelues well in theſe matters are termed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:8683:176"/>
But the other parte which is the ſame whereof I now meane to ſpeake, ſeeketh higher then theſe bodily eyes can penetrate: for it comprehendeth the ſubſtances, notwithſtanding the ſame be ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of all matter: then ſporting it ſelfe in the meditation of things which daylie doe fall out, it ſtayeth vpon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that is deuine &amp; eternal: The participants herein be termed learned men &amp; of great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thereby, as by a ſure guide, this moſt noble part of their ſoule, which is endued with moſt perfect intelligence, is led into thoſe places where it may ſomwhat comprehend thoſe things wherewith it hath ſome correſpondence &amp; ſimilitude: for that which is ſpirituall delighteth in ſpirituall things: &amp; herein conſiſteth the excellencie of the creatures that participate in reaſon, aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mortal and earthly creatures: that they can from farre though vnperfectly diſcerne things immortall and heauenly. This ought to ſollicite them not to ſtifle in them that naturall power which is giuen them to bee well employed. As for the obiects: the moſt ſoueraigne of them is <hi>God,</hi> beyond whom no man can looke, becauſe he is the ende of all endes and the cauſe of all cauſes, and that in him all fulneſſe of perfection doth abide. But there bee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other inferiour as the Angelicall natures, the heauenly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and whatſoeuer is immutable in the order of nature, wherein is a very large ſcope to exerciſe the ſame facultie, which by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall vſe groweth the more perfect.</p>
               <p>To ſee therefore how this may bée put in practiſe, wee are <note place="margin">Of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones as may entend thereto.</note> to conſider of what perſons euery politique bodie is compoſed: which I will deuide into three orders. In the firſt ſhall come the Noble men and Gentrie: In the ſecond, all that beſtowe their time in deuine or humaine learning: And in the third, all other the dwellers both in towne and countrie. As for the firſt, they ſeeme to bee borne with more quicke and plyant inclinations then <note place="margin">The Gentrie.</note> the others: becauſe their fathers hauing atteyned to honor through vertue as well intellectuall as morall, as it is to bee preſumed, haue left vnto them ſome ſmall ſeedes thereof (as neere as nature can forme them) meete to ſpring againe, ſo long as their bringing vp bee no hinderaunce thereto: for confirmation whereof wee doe many times ſee the children of Princes, Lordes and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at ſeauen yeeres of age ſhewe foorth euen pettie miracles of the ſoule. She bringeth them foorth in place where ſhe findeth the agents which ſhe vſeth to bee beſt diſpoſed: euen as wee ſee in a Lanterne that the brighter the glaſſe is, the more doth the inward
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:8683:177"/>
light thereof appeare, and being dimme, ſmall brightneſſe may be ſéené. Theſe therefore hauing ſo good groundes doe want but good inſtructions to bring them to the knowledge of the dignity of man, which conſiſteth in the lifting vp of his minde vnto the author of all his good. Whereto alſo their noble calling ought to exhorte them. And as in the actiue life that they leade, they keepe it ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily occupied in diuers honeſt and profitable things, ſo ſhould they goe forward and thence aſcend to ſpirituall: for he that is deuoyde of ſuch apprehenſions maketh his condition very bad.</p>
               <p>If any man ſaith: Why, are not we preſent at the religious ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies: <note place="margin">Aunſwer to a common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</note> It is but a colde excuſe, becauſe the moſt excellent parte of religion conſiſteth in the inward man. And this doth the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teach vs, when it ſaith that God is a ſpirite and will be woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in ſpirite and truth. And how may it be poſſible to caſte of the heauenly miſteries, if this ſpeculatiue power ſhould not bende as a bowe to the ſearch of ſo high trueths, more neceſſarie for the ſuſtenance of the ſoule then bread is for the bodie? Howbeit, there be but fewe of that degree that are very hot herein: whereof it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that many are ignorant of that which they ought eſpecially to knowe, and are ſkilfull in that which they ought rather to bee ignorant of. For proofe I will alleadge onely one example of a neighbour of myne, who in certaine companie talking of religion ſayd: <hi>Theſe Hugnenots would ſeeme to be great doctors, but knowe no thing. If you diſpute with them, they preſently denye Purgatorie: but then denye you the Trinitie and you neuer ſee men ſo amazed.</hi> This, I ſuppoſe, he ſayd thinking to haue ſayd very well: howbeit it is a lamentable caſe to ſee that he that ought to haue taught others, had neede to haue gone to ſchoole to learne the firſt principles of Chriſtianitie and Godlineſſe, ſith in matters of ciuilitie he was ſufficiently ſeene. The bodily exerciſes which tend to honeſtie are very conuenient for gentlemen, but they droope toward the ground if they be not ſuſteyned by the ſoule, which being deuout, doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene times eſtraunge it ſelfe from this element. Hereof are wee admoniſhed in the fourth Commaundement of the lawe, wherein God declareth that it is his will wee ſhould reſt the ſeauenth day, that is to ſay, that wee ſhould forget all worldly cares, and applye our whole minds to meditate vpon his wonderfull works, as well of our creation and conſeruation as redemption. Wherein we ſee that contemplation is a common duetie, whereto we may aduowe thoſe to be moſt bound that haue receiued moſt kinds of benefites.</p>

But there are alſo and that the greateſt parte whom profite and neceſſitie doe ſtirre vp. Among theſe ſome there are whoſe onely contemplation hath regard to their coffers: which the firſt ſorte regard not, as ayming at better endes. And in deede the chiefeſt duetie of a Philoſopher is to whet his wictes to the knowledge of whatſoeuer exquiſite things in the whole world: whoſe contentation, the higher that the ſpirite penetrateth, the greater it is. As for deuine knowledge which they that haue the Eccleſiaſticall offices doe perticulerly profeſſe, the ſame doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a ſoule free from worldly bonds and lettes, becauſe that in ſo high an argument it is to employ whatſoeuer the agilitie thereof. And to them more properly then to any doth <hi>contemplation</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine. Not that I meane that they ought continually to bee therein occupied as a quadrant to behould the ſunne, for ſo in vaine ſhould they be in office, if they diſcharge not themſelues to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of thoſe that are to receiue the vſurie of ſuch ſpirituall ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents as GOD hath imparted vnto them, namely, ſound doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. Thus doe we ſee that actiue life ought not to bée ſeuered for euer, or any long time from the contemplatiue. And this did the beſt Philoſophers well knowe. Alſo that great Deuine <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> well allowed this orderly compoſition of the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For although the ſpirituall actions are more worthie then the corporall, yet muſt they not be ſeparated.</p>
               <p>I knowe very well that the Munkes, eſpecially the begging <note place="margin">Aunſwer to the obiection of ſuch as i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine the contemplatiue life to belong onely to them ſelues.</note> Fryers and Charterhouſe (for thoſe of <hi>S.

For their Colledges and aſſemblies were as it were nource<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

to furniſh the Church of good miniſters, and out of the ſame were <hi>Gregorie Nazianzene, Baſil, Chriſoſtome,</hi> and many other notable perſons called to be Biſhops. It appeareth therefore that their liues were as well actiue as contemplatiue. For although moſt of them liued in ſolitarie places, to the ende the leſſe to bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted from their ſtudies and morall diſcipline, yet did one of their principall purpoſes tende to make them meete to ſerue in that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die whereof they were but ſmall members. Then being admitted into <hi>Eccleſiaſticall functions,</hi> it was lawfull for them to marie: <note place="margin">Of Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our daies and of Moncks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations.</note> neither was mariage in thoſe daies forbidden. Howbeit, although this auncient maner of Monaſticall life, when ſuch ſimplicitie of rules and hartes reigned, did beare a goodly ſhewe, yet may wee, and that truely, ſay that it was grounded rather vpon the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men then any examples taken out of the ſcriptures. But all theſe things are, by little and little, altered and corrupted: as by comparing them with our daies we may eaſely perceiue. For if we marke well what moſt of our <hi>Monckes</hi> haue ſtudied within theſe threeſcore yeeres, wee ſhall finde it to bée nothing but this, <hi>Hang and burne,</hi> whom: Euen thoſe men who by brotherly admonition wiſhed them not to ſtoope vnto ſo many corruptions as were crept in among them, and did not allowe of their newe found deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Thus are their chiefe contemplations conuerted into fire and blood, which euen to this day doe beare great ſway, though rather in will then effect. <hi>Rabelais</hi> who in his writings mentioneth ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie braue <hi>Monckes</hi> of his time, doth paint vs them out more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and tractable: for ſo farre were they from ſclaundering and hurting, that contrariwiſe they ſought to bee merie and make good theere with all men. Among the reſt he ſpeaketh of <hi>Frier Bernard Lardon,</hi> reſiant in the good towne of <hi>Amiens,</hi> whoſe like was not to be found againe in 36.

               <p>This is the fruite which theſe late worlds haue brought foorth, namely, to haue chaunged the integritie of ould time into the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puritie of theſe daies. The firſt Monkes of whom I haue ſpoken, being repleniſhed with charitie did good to all: moſt of them

Yet will I not ſay but that among that multitude which ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth al ouer the world there be many, who groning vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of ſo many traditions, do wiſh the reformation to the auncient obſeruations endued with great moderation.

Neither haue they bene therein deceiued, for it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to penetrate into high and deepe miſteries but by daily medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.

For whatſoeuer it be which the mind doth but lightly paſſe ouer, it is but a touching of the minde: but when it ſtayeth vpon it, it penetrateth through the thickneſſe of the wood euen to the marrow. He that ſhall conſider of ſpeech which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to man onely, will thinke nothing to bee ſo common and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier: but if he aſcendeth to the inward worde, which is the conceipt of the vnderſtanding, in which receptakle a thouſand images per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and vnperfect, true and falſe bee reſident and paſſe to and fro, which afterwarde be reuealed by the ſenſible ſpeech, he cannot but wonder at Gods ſo wonderfull workmanſhip.

He alſo warned all the <hi>French Churches</hi> to looke to themſelues: of whom the moſt parte imagining to haue alreadie obteyned ſome aſſured reſt, were more ententiue to the building of <hi>Churches,</hi> then to thinke vppon Militarie prouiſion for their owne defence.

Claud</hi> they marched toward <hi>Chaſtres and Angeruile,</hi> and by the way met fiue or ſixe troopes of gentrie. This bred ſome aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to the contrary parte, when they began to conſider the ſudden encreaſe of our bodie, which conſiſted not of leſſe then a thouſand gentlemen, who made 1500. good horſe better armed with courage then Corcelets. Then drew they toward <hi>Orleance,</hi> which was taken in ſuch maner as the Hiſtoriographers doe ſet it doune. This we muſt note, that if the <hi>Prince of Condé</hi> had at that time had but a ſmall power, he had bene oppreſſed or beſieged: but when they perceiued him to bee ſo mightie as to keepe the fielde in ſubiection, alſo that he ſpake as boldly to his aduerſaries as coldly to his King, they were not very earneſt vpon him, whereby he had oportunitie to preuaile in ſundrie attempts. This profite did he reape of being ſtrong in the beginning.</p>
                     <p>Some men haue imagined either that theſe things were long <note place="margin">Occaſion of the aſſemblie of his troupes.</note> before premeditated, or els to haue ſo happely fallen out through the dillgence of the Captaines: But I, as one that was preſent and made curious ſearch into the cauſes, dare affirme the contrary. True it is that moſt of the Nobilitie, hearing of the ſlaughter at <hi>Vaſsie,</hi> partly of a voluntarie good will, and partly for feare, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to drawe toward <hi>Paris,</hi> imagining (as it were at aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) that their protectors might ſtand in ſome néed of them. Thus did the moſt renowmed depart out of their countries with ſome tenne, ſome twentie or thirtie of their friends, ſecretly armed, and lodging in Hoſteries or Uillages, where they payd truely for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing, vntill they met both with the bodie and cauſe together. Many of them haue aſſured me that this only reaſon moued them: and I haue heard my Lords the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Admirall</hi> many times confeſſe, that had not this benefit happened, they had bene in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

The Lord <hi>Prince of Condé</hi> ſeeing how his brother the <hi>King of Nauarre</hi> was by little and little ſlipt into a delicious kinde of life, and had ſuffered himſelfe ſo much to be abuſed by the vayne and ritch promiſes and apparant honors of thoſe that ſkorned him, that he was growne ſo farre as to giue ouer his partie, whereof enſued a wonderfull quailing to many which both openly and ſecretly ſeemed to fauour him, and as great an encouragement to the leagued to withſtand him: did not thinke it good to leane to ſo rotten a fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lay a better els where. In as much alſo as the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> are the two great lights of <hi>France,</hi> the one reſembling the Sunne, the other the Moone (yet both ſubiect to ecclipſe) he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that hauing ſome light from the one, he ought to ſeeke for the light of the other: and therefore endeuoured to plant the preaching of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> in <hi>Paris:</hi> to the ende the ſame knowledge which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was hidden, and lay as it were buryed among the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble multitude of people, might bring forth aboundance of fruite, as ſoone after did it appeare: for ſometimes ye might ſee at the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies thirtie thouſand perſons. Theſe goodly beginnings cauſed thoſe of the Religion to ſeeke meanes to eſtabliſh it, wherein ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe they ſhewed themſelues ſomewhat negligent. But when the effects of the League brake forth, they euidently percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that it was meet to do that which through ouer much forflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was not now eaſely to be done: whereabout neuertheleſſe they ſomewhat employed themſelues, albeit with very ſmall hope.</p>

Hauing more narowlie examined this matter, I finde that as the execution of this purpoſe to anie profite was in the beginning nothing eaſie: ſo in the end it was moſt difficult. I will firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpake of <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſhewe the lettes therein to be found. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man knoweth it to bee the ſeate of <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> which is of meruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous authoritie, and as the fauour thereof woulde haue ſtoode the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in great ſteade, ſo would the miſlyke haue bredde won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull damage. Nowe all the Senate with their whole trayne, except a verie fewe, did alwayes ſhewe themſelues their capitall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cleargie</hi> of that <hi>Citie</hi> beeing moſt mightie and in greate reuerence, were euen madde to ſee thoſe thinges common which touched them ſo neere the quicke, and vnder hande wrought a thou, ſand practiſes there agaynſt. The bodie of the <hi>Townehouſe</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring alterations, which they imagined to proceede of diuerſitie of religion, endeauoured to banniſh and driue it awaie.

Neyther doe I yet ſpeake of ſuch as might happen to haue recourſe to the Citie out of other places, but onelie of thoſe that were then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. As for the aſſured ſtrength that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, it conſiſted of three hundred Gentlemen, and as manie trayned ſouldiours, foure hundred ſchollers, and a fewe voluntarie Burgeſes of no experience.

as <hi>Pompey:</hi> But if they marke it well, they ſhall finde that <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peyes</hi> ouerſight was without compariſon greater than his: For hee had all <hi>Rome</hi> at his becke, where the Prince had ſcarce a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at <hi>Paris.</hi>

                     <p>Before wee applie thoſe auncient examples to the deedes of theſe dayes, wee muſt conſider of the lykelyhoode betweene them. All the aforeſayde difficulties doe perſwade mee that the endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to eſtabliſhe the exerciſe of religion at <hi>Paris,</hi> was a haughtie and valiant attempt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but without the helpe aforeſayde to confirme it, it was vnpoſſible, as that which hath ſince fallen out, hath well declared.</p>
                     <p>Nowe let vs looke into the diſpoſition of the Court. It is wel <note place="margin">Why he could not poſſibly be the ſtronger about the: Kinge and courte.</note> inough knowen that at the conference at <hi>Poyſſy</hi> the doctrine of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> was propounded withall libertie, wherevpon many both greate and ſmal began to haue a taſt thereof: But as a fire of ſtraw maketh a greate blaze, and is by and by out againe for want of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce: ſo after that that which they had receiued as a noueltie was a lyttle growen olde in their heartes, theyr affections thereto quayled, and moſt of them retourned to the former courſe of the <hi>Court,</hi> which is more fit to procure mirth and paſtime and to breed wealth: yea, euen ſome <hi>Huguenots</hi> turnd theyr coates and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this path.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court</hi> wee are in generall to take for the true i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Prince: for as hee is, ſo is his traine. If hee bee wiſe, ſo will it bee: but if hee delyght in follie, it will alſo imitate him. And in caſe a houſeholder through vſe ſhapeth the manners of his children and familie by the patterne of his owne, what ſhall a King doe, in whome it lyeth to raiſe and caſt downe? Heerevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Courtiers ſeeing the King, his Brethren and Mother more inclined to <hi>Romiſh</hi> religion, alſo the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted, conformed themſelues to them, which redounded to the greate diſgrace of the Prince of <hi>Condie,</hi> and thoſe whome hee maintained.</p>
                     <p>Beſides that, if hee had come firſt, hee coulde not haue ſoiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there long without incurring much hatred: for if to a <hi>Court</hi> you propounde reformation, take awaie vaine pleaſures, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle it in buſineſſe, it will hate you euen vnto the death. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie, hauing manie enemies therein and more abroade, hee coulde not but haue verie ſmall aſſuraunce. This maketh mee to thinke that the fouudation of the <hi>Court</hi> was not of anie more
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:8683:184"/>
certayntie than that of <hi>Paris.</hi> Howbeeit hee attempted another deuiſe, (but it was not put in execution) in my opinion of more apparaunce: which was his moouing of the <hi>Queene</hi> mother, to goe and carrie the King to <hi>Orleance:</hi> and ſome writers doe ſaie that it was motioned to her when ſhee feared the motions of the league, alſo that ſhee hearkened thereto: but all vaniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie in ſmoake: neuertheleſſe I ſuppoſe that if the effect heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of had enſued, all theyr weapons had beene ſheathed vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne.</p>
                     <p>For had the <hi>Court</hi> beene in place where it coulde not haue beene ſurpriſed, in reſpect of ſuch force as might haue ben brought, and where it ſhoulde not haue beene forced, for no man durſt haue diſcharged the Canon agaynſt the walles that enuironed the King, they might haue parleyed and dealte on horſebacke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the affayres had beene ſomewhat reeſtabliſhed according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Edict of pacification: not withſtanding euen to imagine that this remedie coulde haue vtterly extinguiſhed the warres, I dare not preſume: onelie it had ſufficed if it had but delayed them for a while.</p>

                     <p>The firſt matter that I meane to ſhew, is in what ſort the Prince <note place="margin">How the Prince of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de ſeaſed vpon Orleance.</note> of <hi>Conde</hi> and his troope ariued at <hi>Orleance.</hi> The daie before hee came hee ſent the Lorde of <hi>Andelot</hi> to take the Towne, who comming vnknowen, perceiued there woulde bee ſome lette<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherevppon hee ſent worde to the ſayde Lorde to make ſpeede to aſſiſt him, for hee was lykelie to haue ſome bickering. Nowe the whole companie beeing loth to looſe ſo good a morcell deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to trot, but euen to galloppe, which was no ſooner ſayde but it was done. For ſixe leagues off beganne the courſe: The Prince hauing with him as well in maiſters as ſeruauntes aboute two thouſande horſe, taking the greate galloppe, the whole bodie did the lyke, and ſo continued euen to the verie gates.</p>
                     <p>Innumerable were the people that they mette by the waie going to <hi>Paris,</hi> who beholding the myſterie of this courſe, and withall, that none aſked them anie queſtion, did for the moſt part at the firſt thinke that all the fooles in <hi>Fraunce</hi> had beene there aſſembled, or elſe that it had beene for ſome wager: for as yet there was not anie noiſe of warre: Howbeit thinking better there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and conſidering both the number and nobilitie, they grewe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to greate admiration, yet ſo as they coulde not but laughe at ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible a motion, which did not beare downe the trees as the windes of <hi>Languedocke,</hi> but ſeemed rather to beare downe it ſelfe: for ordinarilie by the waie they might behold ſeruants caſt downe, horſes ſhouldered and tyred, and ſumpters ouerthrowen, which bred continuall ſporte euen in thoſe which did runne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="355" facs="tcp:8683:185"/>
But they that the ſame daie were thruſt forth of the towne did <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikly</hi> bewaile, their diſpoſſeſſion from the ſtaple of the pleaſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt wines in <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the ſecond point, the matter is of more grauitie, as conſiſting in both generall and priuate accuſations, defences, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <note place="margin">Of writinges publiſhed for the taking of armes in the firſt troubles.</note> and other pollicies to perſwade: which were the weapons wherewith ſo many great Captaines for the ſpace of two moneths fought together, as alſo to comfort and hearten their confederates and partakers. For in theſe ſo new and extraordinarie alterations of eſtate, it was verie requiſite to aboliſh all bad opinions out of the minds of thoſe that knew not the drifts of the enterpriſers: and as the aſſault was great, ſo was the defence forcible, as may appeare by reading the actions as well of the one part as of the other, which are inſerted into the Annales. Some there are that weene if their cauſe be good, that it will ſo ſhew it ſelfe to all men, and therefore will not publiſh the truth thereof: wherein they ouerſhoote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For albeit iuſt and true matters doe in time ſhew forth their light, yet is it in ſundrie occurrences meete to anticipate them, and that men ſhould betimes knowe that that will at length appeare, though not with ſo much fruit. Alſo as weedes doe many times for want of pulling vp, choke the good hearbes: ſo if the ſlanders which the aduerſaries doe ordinarily obiect agaynſt ſuch things as bee good, be not refelled, they would no doubt many times thereby bee ſuppreſſed, beſides that we are the more ſupported when (in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer caſe) we haue proued that we walke vpright and labour with an euen hand.</p>
                     <p>To be briefe, in this world men are ſo ſlothful in publike duties, that without continuall calling vppon, they remaine immoueable. But they that haue but a bad cauſe in hand, haue more need of arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall ſpeeches to cloake that which being reauealed will bring it out of fauour: neither do I thinke them to be tongue tied, whereby we may perceiue that eloquence reſembleth a two edged knife: but whatſoeuer men ſaie, it is a hard matter to diſguiſe falſehood or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh the truth.</p>
                     <p>The third point conſiſteth in the parley néere to <hi>Toury</hi> in <hi>Beauſſe,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Of the parlie betweene the Queene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Prince of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</note> betweene the <hi>Queene Mother,</hi> the <hi>king of Nauare,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Condie,</hi> to deuiſe vpon ſome meanes to appeaſe the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies fallen out.

Some who a parte did more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie conſider of theſe things, bewayled publike diſcord as the ſpring of future miſchiefes: Then waighing with themſelues that all theſe greetings would bee conuerted into bloudie murthers, vppon the leaſt token of battayle that the ſuperiours ſhoulde giue: that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Some will ſaie, that in the ſayd parlies the <hi>Prince of Conde</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded himſelfe into ouer great peril: but he was ſtill ſtronger than the enimie, and his men too warie to be deceiued, albeit in one point they ouerſhoot the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vpon ſimplicitie: which was in deliuering to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> when he came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parley the towne of <hi>Boiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie</hi> (which was nothing worth) for his fafety, but was neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored them again: this did greatly chafe them, as perceiuing that thence forth they muſt talke with the bridle in hand.

By eight of clocke at night the troops were in the field, who after publike praier (as was then vſed among the <hi>Proteſtants)</hi> began to march with ſuch a courage, as I may in truth affirme, that in ſouldiours I neuer ſee greater. Before the departure did a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman commit a moſt villanous act, in forcing of a maiden, whoſe calling together, with the ſhortneſſe of the time were cauſes that it could not be puniſhed. This did many take to be a bad ſigne in this enterpriſe. Preſuming to finde the enemies in their lodginges, the order to fight was this.</p>
                     <p>Firſt the Lord <hi>Admirall</hi> marched formoſt with eight hundred ſpeares, to ouerthrowe whatſoeuer horſemen hee ſhoulde finde in armes: then followed 1200. harquebuts in foure troopes, with charge to aſſayle the watch of the enimies footmen, and thence to enter theyr quarters. Next marched eight hundred harquebuts, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with two great battayles of pikes, to ſeaze vppon their artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie: after all came the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Condee</hi> with one thouſand horſe in foure ſquadrons, and the reſt of the harque buzerie: Now are we to vnderſtand that conſidering at what time they ſet forward, they ſhould by all reaſon haue reached to the enimies lodging by three of the clocke in the morning: for the waie lay ouer a playne field, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any ſtraight paſſage, but that the footemen might march a whole league in an houre and a halfe: but when they had gone two leagues, the guides perceiued that they went wrong, and thinking to recouer their waie, they ſtrayed farther out, remayning as men amazed, and not knowing where they were, to the no ſmall diſcontent of the Captaines. To be briefe, hauing thus trauayled vntill one houre after daie, they found themſelues a long league of from the enimies lodgings, whoſe ſcoutes deſcried the head of the <hi>Princes</hi> armie, and ſo returning with al ſpeed gaue a great alarum. Heerevpon tooke they counſayle what was beſt to bee done: but in the meane time they hearde the Canon diſcharged in the enemies campe, for a warning to call in their horſemen, which brake theyr deuiſe for paſſing any farther, as well for that they we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Lorde <hi>Marſhall of Anuille,</hi> a watchfull and verie ſkilfull Captaine, was with his light horſe lodged at the head of the <hi>Catholikes</hi> armie, wo tolde mee that hee waked and was in armes almoſt all the night, neuertheleſſe if our whole power had come in time, theyr armie had beene in daunger, which is not in deede to bée doubted: for albeit the hazardes of warre bee vncertaine, yet the aduauntage of a ſurpriſe, doth import apparaunt loſſe to thoſe that ſuffer themſelues to bee ſo farre ouertaken. All the faulte was layde vppon the guides, who to cleere themſelues ſaid that the Lord of <hi>Andelots</hi> putting the footemen in araie at the departure from the lodgings made their march the flower: but I thinke this excuſe more ſubtil than true, conſidering there was neither buſh nor hedge to ſtoppe them. In deede if the Countrie had beene ſtraighter, it might haue had ſome likelihood. Both armies, albeit ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder ſtoode in araie vntill two of the clocke afternoone.

Then fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be aſſayled by night, becauſe the <hi>Princes</hi> armie was ſtrong in footmen, and their owne lodgings verie vnfit for horſemen, they made at the head of theyr battayle grounde vppon the comming in, fiue or ſixe great heapes of fagots with ſtrawe inough vnder them, to kindle if they were aſſaulted, to the ende by the light thereof to diſcharge three or foure vollees of artillerie, which woulde haue greatly annoied the aſſaylauntes: There are that diſdayne ſuch inuentions, albeit they may ſometime be to good purpoſe.

The Captaines of both ſides perceiuing that it was harde to ſurprize one another, alſo that theyr lodgings were verie diſcommodious, and moued by a certayne kinde of neceſſitie to get ſome townes which might ſtande them in greate ſteade to continue the warre, as <hi>Bloyſe</hi> and <hi>Boiſgencie,</hi> did in the morning ſende awaie their carriage and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie,

Thereby were al men without conſtraint voluntarily brideled from committing thoſe actions which often times horror of puniſhment is not able to reſtraine: but chiefely the nobilitie in this beginning ſhewed themſelues worthie their name: for marching ouer the Champion Countries (where they haue without compariſon grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter libertie to ſpoyle, than in the Townes) they neyther ſpoyled nor miſuſed theyr hoſtes, but were content with a little: &amp; their heads and moſt of themſelues that had brought anie wealth from home paide honeſtly for all things: Then ſhould we not ſee anie running out of the villages, neither heare any cries or complaintes.

Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this ſo ſudden victorie, which, ſayd they, was the cutting off of one of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> armes, puffed vp and very ioyfull, they entered deliberation of their affayres.

That the ſtrangers that looked vp and euen tickled to come into France, when they ſhould but heare of the ſiege thereof, would not bee very willing to ſet forward. That they had men enowe to begin the ſiege: for placing and fortifying two thouſandmen in the little gate to bridle the towne on that ſide, they ſhould ſtill haue tenne thouſand footmen &amp; three thouſand horſe, who might ſuffice vnto the ariuall of other their power that was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. Finally, that the towne was but weake, as being neither well flancked, nor well diched, and hauing no counterſcarpe: Onely there was a rampier wherein thirtie Canons would in ſixe daies make a breach of two hundred foote. But, ſayd they, if ye giue thoſe Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes any respite to finiſh their fortifications, wherein they labour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, wee ſhall not bee poſſibly able to winne it.

of victuals was not eaſie to be taken. That in conſideration aforeſayd, it were to no purpoſe with twelue thouſand men to pitch their campe againſt it, conſidering how many ſeuerall campes for the well encloſing thereof they muſt make. Moreouer, that to vndertake ſuch a peece of worke without at the leaſt two hundred thouſand of poulder, twelue thouſand bullets, and two thouſand Pyoners, all which the Kings whole power was not able to gather together in one moneth, were as a man ſhould ſay, to take ſhipping without Biſcuit. That they had elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where more eaſie worke which was requiſite to be prouided for: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to take from the enemies the towne of Rcan whileſt it were yet weake, for that the Engliſhmen being by them drawne thether might there frame a great armie, to goe afterward where they liſt, in respect whereof that arme muſt be ſpeedily cut off. As for whatſoeuer power the Lord of Andelot might bring in, if they would ſend there againſt 1500. horſe and 4000. ſhot, the ſame vnder the fauour of the countries, townes and riuers might ſuffice either to ſtoppe or cut them in peeces. Then hauing atchieued al this, they ſhould haue a very fit time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daunger of empeachment to plant a notable ſiege before Orleance, wherewith to winne it either ſpeedily by maine force, or at the length, by mynes and ſappe, or finally by building fortes round about it.</hi> This laſt counſaile tooke place and was followed, and to bee plaine with you, I take it was the better: for in the towne there were for the defence thereof aboue fiue thouſand ſtraungers, beſides the enha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants: ſtore of munition: the Rauelines begunne and the fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Iles almoſt finiſhed.

There was alſo a fierce aſſault

giuen without any order, but at the third it was wonne. I haue heard that the <hi>Duke of Guize</hi> commaunded their leaders that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they forced the Rampier, they ſhould not neuertheleſſe runne ſcattered here and there whereſoeuer the ſpoyle of ſo rich a towne might drawe them, but to march in ſundrie troopes of two or three hundred men a peece ſtraight to the Market place: which if they found abandoned then the Souldier to ſeeke his aduenture: for he doubted that thoſe men who had fought ſo couragiouſly, would there yet worke their laſt ſpite, which neuertheleſſe they did not, albeit it was a wiſe foreſight. For it hath bene ſeene in other Townes, that when the aſſailants haue pierced euen to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place, they haue bene driuen backe beyond the Rampier with great ſlaughter of thoſe that were ſcattered abroad about pillage. It is alſo ſayd, that the ſpoyle laſted but three daies, which is ſuch an order as ought to bee taken with whatſoeuer townes a man liſt to preſerue: namely, one day to gather the bootie, an other to tranſport it, and the third to compound. Howbeit, in theſe affayres the ſuperiours doe lengthen or ſhorten the tearme as they pleaſe, or as they knowe that they may procure obedience: and this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience doth much ſooner appeare in poore and ſmall houlds, then in great and rich townes.</p>
                     <p>This was one of the principall acts of our firſt tragedies, and ſo much the more notable in that there was a King ſlayne, foure thouſand men on both ſides either ſlayne or wounded, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Citie in <hi>France</hi> for wealth, abandoned to the ſpoyle of the Souldier.

Now the <hi>Lord of Guize</hi> had ſome inckeling of this enterpriſe, that it ſhould be performed at midnight: whervpon he kept all his horſemen and footmen in armes al the night long in the trenches euery one in his quarter appoynted: But when the clocke had ſtroke foure in the morning and that they perceiued no noyſe from our campe, they all ſayd that it was but ſome falſe allarum, and that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> harts would not ſerue to ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, alſo that it was to no purpoſe (conſidering the extreame colde) to freeze them vp a whole nights ſpace vpon a ſimple ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, peraduenture without any ground.

The firſt thing that happened, albeit it were not of any great <note place="margin">1 The counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of both the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> importance, may yet be noted as an extraordinary matter. That is, that although both armies were aboue two long houres within a Canon ſhot each of other, as well to put themſelues in aray, as to comtemplate their aduerſaries, yet was there not any ſkirmiſh ſmall or great before the generall battell, albeit in many other bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels that haue bene fought the ſame haue bene the for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

There euery man ſtoode faſt, imagining in himſelfe that they that came againſt him were no <hi>Spaniards, Engliſhmen,</hi> or <hi>Italians,</hi> but <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> and thoſe of the braueſt: among whom were their companions, friends and kinſefolkes, as alſo that within one houre they were to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They were afterward alſo beſet with two Cornets of <hi>Reiſtres,</hi> whom they withſtoode, and laſtly with one of <hi>Reiſtres &amp; Frenchmen</hi> together, who made them to retire, albeit with ſmall diſorder, towarde their men that had bene behoulders of their valour. And notwithſtanding their Colonel and almoſt al their Captaines were left dead in the place, yet did they by ſuch reſiſtance purchace great glorie.</p>
                     <p>The third act was the <hi>Lord of Guizes</hi> long patience, whereby <note place="margin">3 The Lorde of Guizes pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. cauſe of his victorie.</note> he attained to the victorie: for after the bodie of the battell which the <hi>Lord Conſtable</hi> led was wholy ouerthrowne except the <hi>Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi>
                        <pb n="381" facs="tcp:8683:197"/>
and himſelfe taken, the ſayd Lord ſtood faſt, waiting whether they would rome to ſet vpon him: for as yet the <hi>Prince of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dées</hi> footmen had not fought, whereto alſo parte of his horſemen ſtill gathered into aray beſides thoſe that yet houered: but this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantgard thus ſetting a good face on the matter, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> durſt not bite: In the meane time ſome of them ſtayed to charge the <hi>Suitzers,</hi> as is aforeſayd: others to purſue thoſe that fled, and many to ſpoyle the cariages, wherein they ſpent an houre and a halfe. Sundrie euen of the <hi>Lord of Guizes</hi> parte ſeeing him ſtand ſtill ſo long while they that were ouerthrowne were purſued, wiſt not what to thinke of him, as if he had bene beſide himſelfe: and I beléeue ſome accuſed him of cowardlineſſe, as the <hi>Romaines</hi> did <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> almoſt in the like caſe: euen ſome of his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries began alreadie to crye that the victorie was theirs: but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that I heard the late <hi>Lord Admirall</hi> aunſwer: <hi>We are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, for by and by wee ſhall ſee this great clowde diſſolue vpon vs:</hi> And it ſo happened ſoone after, wherevpon enſued the chaunge of fortune. Hereby did the <hi>Lord of Guize</hi> well ſhewe that he did but watch for oportunitie: and could patiently behould the diſordering of the <hi>Prince of Condées</hi> great troopes (which at the beginning being ioyned againe might haue troubled him ſhrewdly) about theſe ſmall actions afore rehearſed: But after he did ſee them ſo ſcattered, he marched with ſuch a bould countenance that he found but ſmall reſiſtance. Wee are not therefore ſuddenly to iudge of the entents of theſe great Captaines: for the effects doe afterward diſcouer their conſiderations to bee otherwiſe then many would imagine.</p>
                     <p>The fourth thing worthie memorie was the long continuance of <note place="margin">4 The long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the battell.</note> the battaile: for ordinarily in battailes in one houre we ſee al wonne and loſt, yea that of <hi>Montcontour</hi> laſted not ſo long: but this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning about one of the clocke after noone laſted vntill fiue: yet muſt wee not imagine that they fought all this while, for they had many pawſes, and ſometimes gaue ſmall onſets, and ſometime great, which caried away the beſt men, and this continued vntill darke night. Truely the courage on both ſides was wonderfull, as the great number of the dead did ſufficiently teſtifie, which as many men ſay, amounted to aboue ſeauen thouſand men, of whome the moſt were ſlayne rather in fight then in flight. But the chiefe cauſe of the prolonging of it was as I thinke becauſe the Kings armie was ſtrong in footmen, and the <hi>Prince of Condées</hi> in horſemen.
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:8683:198"/>
For the one could not breake the great battailes, neither the other driue away the horſes. If wee doe well conſider all battailes that haue bene fought ſince the <hi>Suizers</hi> battell, which fought againe the next day, wée ſhall finde none comparable to this, yea the battell of <hi>S. Laurence</hi> was ended in halfe an houre.</p>
                     <p>The fifth accident was the taking of the two Generalles of the <note place="margin">5 The taking of the two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralles of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> armies, a rare matter, becauſe that they ordinarily doe neuer fight but in the ende and vpon extremitie: and many times a battell is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wonne before they came to this poynt. But theſe ſtayed not ſo long, for in the beginning each of them endeuoured to ſet his men an example not to dallie. The <hi>Lord Conſtable</hi> was firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ſore wounded, hauing likewiſe bene wounded in ſeauen battailes that he had bene in, which is teſtimonie ſufficient of his courage: and the Lord <hi>Prince</hi> was likewiſe taken toward the ende and wounded alſo. Herevpon may growe a queſtion, whether a Generall ought to aduenture ſo farre? Whereto it may bee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that this is not to be termed aduenturing, when the maine battaile marcheth to the charge, and ſo he departe not out of his place: Beſides that theſe hauing good ſeconds, did the leſſe feare the daunger of their perſons: for the one had the <hi>Lord of Guize,</hi> and the other the <hi>Admirall,</hi> who both alſo were farre enough in the conflict.</p>
                     <p>The ſix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> was the maner how both the armies parted, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">6 The retraite of both the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> times happeneth otherwiſe then there it did. Wee lightly ſee that the end of a battaile is the flight of the partie ouercome, which is withall purſued two or three leagues, and ſometimes farther. But here we may ſay was no purſuite, but the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> retired an eaſie pace and in order, hauing yet two battailes of <hi>Reiſtres</hi> and one of <hi>French</hi> horſemen, in all amounting vnto about 1200. horſe. But the <hi>Lord of Guize,</hi> who was weake in horſe, not willing to abandon his footmen, was content to haue followed fiue or ſixe hundred paces after them. Thus as well the one as the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wearie, the night comming on parted them. He tooke his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the fielde where the battaile was fought, and the <hi>Admirall</hi> went to a Uillage a long league of, whether his footmen with all his cariages were retired. Some hould opinion that the battaile was not loſt becauſe the loſers were not quite diſordered, but ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are deceiued. For he that getteth the field, winneth the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie and taketh the footmens Enſignes, hath tokens enowe of the victorie: albeit it may bee ſayd that it was not at the full, as if
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:8683:198"/>
plaine flight had enſued. If anie man ſhould replie that often times they had ſeene the two armies retire each from other in good order, as at <hi>Roche-abeille,</hi> alſo the fridaie before the battail of <hi>Moncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour:</hi> It is true, but then had they not had any maine fight as heere, but onely great ſkirmiſhes, wherein eyther parte kept their aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the ground. There are yet liuing many Gentlemen &amp; Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines able to remember what was there done, &amp; ſtil to deliuer ſome obſeruations thereupon.</p>
                     <p>Finallie, I thought good to ſet downe yet one thing aboue my <note place="margin">How the Lord of Guyze in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the Lord Prince of Conde.</note> number, as alſo it happened after the battaile, which was the curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and honeſtie that the Lord of <hi>Guize</hi> beeing the conquerour vſed toward the Lord <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Condie</hi> his priſoner, which moſt men of each parte did not thinke that hee would haue done: for it is well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough knowen how odious in ciuill watres the chiefe of either fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, as alſo what things are imputed vnto them, ſo as if they fall into their enimies hands, after many reproches which they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to beare, their liues alſo are in daunger. Howbeit here it fell out contrarie: for being brought before him, hee ſpake reuerentlie vnto him, and with verie modeſt ſpeeches, wherein hee coulde not gather that hee meant to gird or checks him. Alſo ſo long as he ſoiourned in the campe, he oftentimes did eate with him: likewiſe becauſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this daie of battayle they coulde haue but few beds brought, the rather for that the carriages were halfe rifled and ſcattered, be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him his bed, which the ſayd Lord <hi>Prince</hi> would not accept, but for the one halfe. Thus did theſe two mightie <hi>Princes</hi> beeing as it were capital enimies, both in one bed, the one triumphing, the other a priſoner, take theyr reſts together. It may be ſayd that the Lorde <hi>Marſhall</hi> of <hi>Anuill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus through yron, fire, and water aboue eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men were loſt: But the feare that was brought into the towne was greater than the hurt, and it was openly ſayde that the Iles which they had fortefied were wonne, yea, that they fought at the chiefe gate, which daunted euen the boldeſt.

But vndoubtedly if in the beginning they had made a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral head agaynſt the town, they had wonne it, ſo great was the feare and ſo ſmall the remedies: At the leaſt they had beene ſure of the Iles, which had bene as much as to haue had the towne within fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes after.

Thus did the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes</hi> looſe a braue occaſion, and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> eſcape as great a daunger.

Of ſo good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe did not onelie the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> but alſo his whole armie, which exceeded twentie thouſand, conceiue great hope.

ſome ſuch as are as true as the ſame that haue ben publiſhed, which I haue learned of thoſe that on the one ſide had in part the conduct of the affaires. The edict of pacification concluded before <hi>Orleance</hi> had greatly ſatiſfied almoſt all <hi>France,</hi> as well in appearance as in effect, becauſe thereby all miſeries ceaſing, euerie man inioyed reſt with ſafetie of bodie &amp; libertie of minde. Howbeit the hatred &amp; enuy of ſome, as alſo the miſtruſt of others was not quite extinguiſhed, but lay hidden and vnperceiued. But as time doth commonly bring all things to perfection, ſo theſe ſeeds together with many worſe, brought forth ſuch fruit as returned vs into our former diſcords: the chiefe of the religion who looked to the ſafetie as well of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues as of other made a general collection of all that was wrought &amp; ſtil practiſed againſt them, affirming that vndoubtedly their enemies endeuoured by little and little to vndermine them, &amp; then euen at once to giue them their deaths wound. Of the cauſes that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged ſome were manifeſt, and ſome ſecret. Concerning the firſt, they conſiſted in the razing of ſundrie townes, and the building of <hi>Citadels</hi> in the places were they had their publike exerciſe: alſo in murthers in ſundrie places co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, &amp; the ſlaughter of diuerſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Gentlemen, whereof they could haue no iuſtice.

And for the ſecret they propounded certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted letters comming from <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; <hi>Spaine,</hi> wherin the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that ſhould be put in execution were more plainly diſcouered: The reſolution concluded with the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> at <hi>Bayon</hi> to root out all the <hi>Huguenots</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Rogues</hi> in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> whereof they were aduertiſed by ſuch as were not doubted of. All theſe things with many more that I omit did greatly waken thoſe that were loth to be taken ſleeping: and I remember that the chiefe of the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> met thriſe at <hi>Vallery</hi> &amp; <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> whether came 10 or 12. of the notableſt Gentlemen to determine vpon theſe preſent wars, alſo to ſeeke ſome lawfull &amp; honeſt meanes of ſafetie among ſo many terrors without proceeding to the vttermoſt extremities. Howbeit rather by the counſaile of the L. <hi>Admirall</hi> than of anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euery one was deſired a while to haue patience, for that in ſo waightie affaires as theſe, which brought with them many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, men ought rather to be drawen by neceſſitie, than to runne headlong vpon will: withal that in ſhort time they ſhould ſee more.

Doe wee not alreadie ſee the foraine enemie march armed toward vs, and threaten to bee reuenged on vs, as well for ſo many iniuries done to them at Dreux, as alſo for thoſe harms which in our defences we haue done to the Catholikes?

approch. Some wiſhed the Captaines to ſeaze vpon <hi>Orleance,</hi> &amp; confederate towne, and then to certefie their maieſties that percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the approch of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thought it good abroade in the Prouinces to ſeaze vppon as many townes as they might, and then to ſtand vpon the defenſiue, whoſe aduice was not admitted neyther, becauſe that: (as it was ſayde) in the firſt troubles of a hundred that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> helde, within eight moneths they had not twelue lefte, for want of power to ſuccour them. Finally, they concluded to take armes, &amp; in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this warre to obſerue foure things. Firſt to ſeaze vpon fewe townes, but the ſame to bee of importaunce: Secondlie, to frame a Iuſtie armie: Thirdlie, to cut in peeces the <hi>Suitzers,</hi> vnder whoſe fauour the <hi>Catholikes</hi> would alwayes bee the maiſters of the field: Laſtlie, to indeauour to baniſh the <hi>Cardinall of Loraine</hi> from the <hi>Court,</hi> as him whome many did imagine to bee a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nua ſalliciour of the King to root out the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties were there propounded concerning the two laſt pointes. For, ſayde ſome, the <hi>Cardinall</hi> and the <hi>Suitzers</hi> did continuallie march with the Kings perſon, ſo as aſſayling the one, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring to terrefie the other, euerie man woulde affirme their enterpriſe to be directlie agaynſt the royall maieſtie and no other: but they were decided by this aunſwere: That the euent ſhoulde diſcouer their intentes, euen as they gaue teſtimonie of King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeauenth, who beeing but <hi>Dolphine</hi> tooke armes, but neyther againſt his Father nor the Realme. Moreouer, that it was well knowen that the French in bodie had neuer attempted againſt their Princes perſon: Finallie, that if this theyr firſt ſucceſſe fell out fauourable, it might cutte off the courſe of a long and ruinous warre, in that they ſhoulde haue opportunitie to open vnto the King the truth of matters, which yet was concealed from him, whereof might enſue a newe confirmation of the ediots, namelie, when they that purpoſed to preuent ſhoulde finde themſelues pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented.</p>

This was the reſolution taken among thoſe men that were then preſent, who albeit they were indued with great knowledge, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, valour, and diſcretion, yet al that they had ſo diligentlie fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt and examined, when it came to effecte, was wonderfull wide from their expectation, &amp; other things almoſt vnthought of, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted eyther to ſure or difficult, redou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to their greateſt benefit. Whereof it followeth that wee may heereby perceiue that good ſucceſſe doth not alwayes followe good deliberatious. Howbeit all this haue I not heere ſpoken to the ende to controll thoſe that I haue named, of whoſe vertue I haue euermore greatly admired, neither to cauſe men in their affaires to neglect diſcretion or dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but onelie to aduertiſe them that the accompliſhment of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie our workes conſiſteth not in the purpoſes of man, but in <hi>Gods</hi> diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>Now let vs marke the ſucceſſe of theſe enterpriſes. For the firſt <note place="margin">Of the ſucceſſe of the Princes attempts.</note> points which concerned the townes it was determined to ſurpriſe onelie three, viz. <hi>Lions, Tholouſe,</hi> and <hi>Troy,</hi> and that for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie in diuerſe reſpects enſuing of the ſame. But the purpoſes of thoſe that vndertooke the charge of ſeazing vpon them fell out to be in vaine. Concerning ſtrength of the field, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were in the beginning ſtronger than the <hi>Catholikes,</hi> but within a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and a halfe after the taking of armes the <hi>Catholikes</hi> were the mightier, whereby they forced them to haue recourſe to ſtraungers whom they had called to their ſuccour. The execution of the <hi>Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi> had as bad ſucceſſe, as well for that this purpoſe was diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as through want of power. Now reſted no more but the fourth point, which beeing of ſmalleſt importaunce was brought to paſſe, and that was the parting of the <hi>Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Loraine</hi> from the Court, who notwithſtanding was of as greate authoritie there as before time. But thereof grew another inconuenience to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes.</hi> Which was, that they ſtirred vp the Kings hatred and indignation agaynſt them, in that by theyr occaſion hee was forced with feare and ſpeed to retyre to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo as euer after he bare them a grudge. This had beene but an vnhappie beginning of the warre vnto them if other effectes had not recompenſed the firſt defaultes: which neuertheleſſe happened rather by the motions of diuerſe particular Gentlemen, together with the diſpoſition of ſundrie the inhabitants of townes, than through anie the great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations afore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cioned, wherof enſued the ſeazure of ſundry both good &amp; had, of which the neereſt were <hi>Orlea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, Auxerre</hi> &amp; <hi>Soiſſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</hi>

                     <p>The ſecond notable action conſiſted in that with leſſe than fiue <note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> hundred horſe, they durſt aduenture vpon ſix thouſand <hi>Suitzers,</hi> and make them to retyre.

Likewiſe as men can hardlie abandon their naturall inclinations, ſo the perſwaſions which their heads vſed were different: for the <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>Condie</hi> beeing of a pleaſant diſpoſition did ſo conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie gird theſe chollerike and buſie perſons that hee made euen thoſe that moſt exceeded either in the one or the other to laugh. On the other ſide the <hi>Admirall</hi> with his graue ſpeeches did ſo ſhame them that in the end they were forced to appeaſe and quiet themſelues. At the ſame time my ſelfe aſked him of his beſt counſayle in caſe <hi>Monſieur</hi> ſhould followe vs? <hi>We would march,</hi> ſayd he, <hi>towarde Bacchara, where the Reiſters ſhould make their aſſemblie:</hi> alſo that <hi>it were not for vs to fight without them, and that after the enimies firſt heat was ſomwhat quailed:</hi> But, what if the <hi>Reiſters</hi> were not there, would ſome man ſaie, what coulde the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> then doe?

Then was there nothing but ſinging and leaping, yea, they that had moſt cried out did leape higheſt. Theſe their behauiours did verie wel verefie the ſaying of <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

There was it expedient for him to make of neceſſitie vertue: and as well himſelfe as the L. <hi>Admiral</hi> being in great credice with the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> employed all their cunning, credite, and eloquence to perſwade euerie man to depart with whatſoeuer his abilitie would beare toward this ſo neceſſarie contribution, wherevppon depended the contentation of thoſe whome ſo diligently they had waited for. Hereof the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues gaue the firſt example in giuing their own ſiluer veſſel: The miniſters in their Sermons exhorted heereto, and the moſt zealous Captaines prepared their men: for in ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie a matter they had neede to vſe all kindes of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. There did ſundrie of the Gentry ſhewe a greate readineſſe to diſcharge themſelues loyallie: But the chiefe brunt of this
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:8683:207"/>
battaile appeared whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they came to vrge the ſcholers of <hi>Lady Pico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ree,</hi> whoſe propertie it was to be readie to take, and ſlacklie to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe: howbeit partly by loue &amp; partly by feare they quit themſelues better than men looked for: yea, this liberalitie was ſo generall, that euen the ſouldiours lackies and boies gaue euerie one ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, ſo as in the end it was accounted a diſhonour to haue giuen but little.

                     <p>To bee briefe, the whole beeing gathered together there was in monie, in plate, and in chaines of golde aboue foure ſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Frankes: which came in ſo good ſeaſon, that without it they could hardly haue appeaſed their <hi>Reiſters.</hi> I knowe that many of them were vrged to giue by example, ſhame, and perſuaſions, but certainlie a great part did it vpon zeale and affection, as appeared in that they offered more than was required of them.

All theſe ſmall helpes proceeding from fortie cornets (for there about wee then were) being gathered together, amounted vnto a great deale: yea, and thence ſometimes they ſent both fleſh and wine, whereto the Gentrie were ſo affectionate that from their lodgings they would not ſpare their carriages for conduct of whatſoeuer was requiſite.

                     <p>Now muſt I ſpeake of the lodging of the armie which they were <note place="margin">Of the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the armie.</note> forced to ſcatter abroade, and that for two principall reaſons. The one for the commoditie of virtuall, the other that it might be vnder couert, whereby to be defended from the iniurie of the winter: for without this help it could not conſiſt. I know this to be a verie bad kinde of lodging: alſo that in imperial &amp; royall warres men would beware of committing ſuch ouer ſights, leaſt they might be ſtraight wayes ſurpriſed: But in ciuill warres both partes were forced and accuſtomed ſo to doe, at the leaſt in <hi>France.</hi> The footmen were lodged in two bodies, viz. in a maine battayle and an auantgarde, and the horſemen in the villages next to hand. Uppon anie earneſt allarum the horſemen drewe to their quarters: likewiſe if one ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall lodging were aſſayled, the others went ſtraight to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue.</p>
                     <p>Among the Cornets there were many harquebuziers on horſback, and when they were come to their quarter, all the wayes were very well fortefied: and many times they prouided themſelues in the Churches and Caſtles, ſo to holde out two good houres vntill they might haue ſuccour. I haue ſometimes ſeene one of the Generals march with fiue or ſixe hundred men and beate back the enimie that had aſſayled ſome lodging. Howbeit notwithſtanding whatſoeuer watch on all ſides, yet there happened many ſurpriſes, albeit the waies were beaten both night and daie. Many times wee had our beſt aduice from the <hi>Picorers,</hi> who buzzing abroade like flyes did ordinarilie meet with the enimie, and ſo ſome one brought in word, for theſe men to flie are as ſwift as hares, and when they goe about ſome bootie they euen flie. The head towarde the enimie who had light horſmen did commonlie conſiſt of fiue hundred good horſe, and as many harquebuziers on horſebacke, with ſmall ſtore of carriage, except horſe of burthen, which was done to the end to keepe the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies buſie, that they ſhould make no enterpriſe, alſo that the armie might alwayes haue warning.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the order of the march, all the troopes had theyr meeting nominated at a certaine houre in place conuenient, for the <note place="margin">The march.</note> diuiſion of the lodgings: and thence they repayred each to his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as alſo they vſed greate ſpeede when they were to trauayle ſundrie wayes. One inconuenience there was in marching thus ſcatteringlie, namelie, that oftentimes they did vſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny falſe allarums. Neuertheleſſe it was neuer noted that the

But the ſureſt waie were to reforme our cuſtomes by the ancient militarie rules, wherin is more perfection than in thoſe which wee now a dayes doe practiſe. Yet muſt we not ſaie that theſe great Captaines ought to haue done otherwiſe than they did, for they neuer fayled in ought that either could or ſhould be done.

                     <p>This ſayde, they all promiſed not to fayle in theyr dueties, and in this reſolution they marched on.

There was giuen a braue charge, wherein the Lord of <hi>Martignes</hi> lieuetenaunt was ſlayne, and the Lorde of <hi>Ande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot</hi> forced to permitte him free paſſage. He ſuffered not his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours to ſpoyle the carryages that ſtoode in the waies, but made them to march on. Within one league of the ſame place hee mette a companie of Captaine <hi>Cognees</hi> horſe marching, whome with harquebuze ſhotte hee ſent backe a pace: agayne a quarter of a league from <hi>Roſiers</hi> there mette him two hundred harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers whome the Lorde of <hi>la None</hi> ſent towarde the allarum to ſuccour the reſt: but the Lorde of <hi>Martigues</hi> footemen beeing all olde ſouldiours and the others newe, did ſo diſorder them as they were forced to abandon the village, and leaue him free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
                     <p>Finallie, within two leagues of <hi>Saumure</hi> hee founde yet another companie of footemen lodged in a Church, whome hee forced and tooke theyr Enſigne, and ſo at the ſhutting in of the euening came ſafe with his men well wearyed with fighting and marching, hauing loſt but twentie of them, but ſlayne foure times as many of his enemies, and ſcarred aboue a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande.</p>
                     <p>This exploit did I thinke good to ſette downe, as ſeeming to bee repleniſhed with a braue determination: albeit it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Both parties therefore hauing appoynted their generall meeting at a great borowe named <hi>Pamprow,</hi> plentifull in victualles, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals of both the campes came thether much about one time with their troopes, from whence they beate each other forward and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward twiſe or thriſe, ſo deſirous was euery man to catch that bone to knawe vpon, which in the ende was giuen ouer. Howbeit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them knowing very well that they ſhould haue ſupport, ſtood ſtiffe, and would not flee but retired a quarter of a league of, where they ſet themſelues in battaile aray: Afterward came the <hi>Lord Admirall</hi> and <hi>d'Andelot</hi> with fiue Cornets of horſe onely, and on the behalfe of the <hi>Catholickes</hi> came ſeauen or eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Speares. <hi>It is now,</hi> ſayd the <hi>Lord Admirall, no ſpeaking of lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging but of fighting:</hi> and with all ſpeede aduertiſed the <hi>Prince,</hi> who was a long league of, to ſet forwarde, in the meane time he would ſet a good face on the matter.

Being thus in aray within a Canon ſhot each of other, he willed a Captaine of harquebuziers on horſeback to ſet forwarde fiue hundred paces, and to ſtay neere to a hedge, which he did: But as theſe people albeit they can diſcharge run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning are not neuertheleſſe ſkilfull ſouldiers, ſo had they not ſtayed there ſixe paternoſters while but halfe of them moued to ſkirmiſh, and after marched their whole Cornet to ſupport them: The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſeeing this, imagined they would haue comen to them, which made them to cloſe themſelues &amp; with three or foure great troopes of Speares begin to ſet forward. Truely at that time I ſaw theſe two Captaines very ſorie that they had not foreſeene the folly of that foole, but more becauſe they wiſt not what counſaile to take, ſeeing their enemies much ſtronger then themſelues: Howbeit, when they came to conclude, each of them concluded otherwiſe then his nature or cuſtome did import. The Lord of <hi>Andelot</hi> who neuer found any thing too hot, ſayd that they ought to retire the pace: that the enemie being the ſtronger would giue vs the foyle:

and that wee ſhould not reſpect the ſhame, conſidering that he that ſcapeth the perill, beſides the profite that he reapeth doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo enioy the honor. The <hi>Lord Admirall,</hi> a man of great conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, was obſtinatly bent to abide, ſaying that it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie with a good countenance to hide our weakeneſſe, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly ſent to reuoke the harquebuziers, wherevpon the enemie ſtayed.</p>
                     <p>Now, albeit this counſaile was profitable, yet was the <hi>Lord of Andelots</hi> the ſurer and to be preferred; at the leaſt in my opinion, <note place="margin">Aduice vppon the aforeſaid aduenture.</note> who thought it good to rehearſe this ſmall action ſomewhat at large, to the ende that ſuch as would bee inſtructed in deedes of armes may reape this fruite, viz.

The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were determined to follow the enemie euen into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie of his armie, alſo to fight with him wherſoeuer they might find him. Herevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>L. Admiral</hi> followed their ſteps which were euident enough, and the <hi>Prince</hi> marched after. But where as there
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:8683:217"/>
were two waies, the one leading to the borowe of <hi>Sanſay,</hi> the other to <hi>Iaſnueil,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> through a miſt that aroſe afore breake of day, ſtrayed and tooke the way to <hi>Iaſnueil.</hi> The forefront which being ſtrong, the <hi>Lord Admirall</hi> had ſet before him, about eight of the clocke in the morning came vpon the borowe of <hi>Sanſay,</hi> where fiue or ſixe hundred horſe were lodged, who were forced to retire more then the pace, loſt all their cariages, and were purſued very farre. In the meane time the <hi>Prince</hi> continuing the way that he had taken, after he had marched two leagues lighted vpon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front of <hi>Monſiers</hi> armie, not hearing any newes of his aduant-guard. Then ſeeing himſelfe beſet, he thought it beſt to ſet a good countenance, and ſeeing the countrie was ſtrong, he placed his Harquebuziers, who were aboue twelue thouſand, formoſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the ſkirmiſh: he alſo ſent word to the <hi>Admirall</hi> (albeit he wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Before the meſſenger was in the midde way, the <hi>Lord Admirall</hi> heard the Canon rore, wherevpon he doubted of that which was happened, and marched toward the noyſe with all that he could gather: but when he came to the place the Sunne was going downe, whereby they could haue no time to conſult, diſcouer, or enterpriſe any matter in groſſe: But al went away in great ſkirmiſhes as braue as any that had bene ſeene of long time, which ſomewhat amazed <hi>Monſiers</hi> armie by reaſon it ſtood vpon a very diſcommodious ground, which notwithſtanding it ſtill ſet a good face on the matter. They ſee not one an other, as being hidden with hedges and ſmall vallies, neither was there any but the looſe Shot perceiued. I could well note that our men were full of courage, but the conduct was not alike: for they diſcharged as it had bene for ſalutation and remayned too cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, yea a whole regiment aſſailed at once, where contrariwiſe <hi>Monſiers</hi> came ſcattered ſhooting ſlowly and marching in ſmall troopes, ſo as two hundred harquebuziers could keepe a whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> occupied. Howbeit, they could not keepe ſome of ours from entring euen into the firſt tentes, which their heate coſt them dere: for the Lord of <hi>la Valette</hi> twiſe charged them with three hundred Speares, and ſlewe ſome hundred and fiftie. Now may ſome man aſke, if the <hi>Princes</hi> whole armie had come with him what would haue enſued? I am of opinion that the other would haue bene ſhrewdly ſhaken, for their battaile ground was ſo
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:8683:217"/>
ſtraight that they had not enough to haue ſet them in aray: when they ſhould haue come to fight wee might haue caſt vppon their flanckes (which was al vpon a ſtrong ground) tenne thouſand har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers, ſupported with one thouſand horſe: Then with the reſt of the footmen and aboue one thouſand &amp; fiue hundred horſe haue charged vpon their front, who could hardly haue borne it. The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Captaines there preſent, if they liſt to ſay the truth cannot greatly gainſay this, for they neuer were ſo, peſtered as then, as my ſelfe haue heard euen of the beſt, who haue not concealed it from me. The night comming on the <hi>Prince</hi> went to take his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging at <hi>Sanſay,</hi> which was but a league and a halfe of.</p>

While wee houered, all our footmens cariage came and ſtayed along a woods ſide not farre from the taile of our men of warre, and there prouided them ſelues, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they ſhould haue pitched in that place, &amp; making aboue 4000. fires they perceiued not the retiring of the armie by reaſon of the night, whereby many maiſters had but had ſuppers. Some of the <hi>Catholickes</hi> watch haue confeſſed vnto me, that ſeeing ſo many fires and hearing ſuch noyſe they tooke it certainly to be our armie and expected the battaile in the morning: wherevpon they were the more diligent in fortifying all the waies. The late Captaine <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> alſo could me that himſelfe offered to goe and diſcouer what it might bee: but they would venture nothing againſt thoſe braue Souldiers. About midnight the <hi>Prince</hi> was aduertiſed that all the cariages were as it were encloſed and it was accompted loſt, neuertheleſſe, he ſent foure or fiue Cornets to get it away, and an houre after commanded one thouſand horſe and two thouſand har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers to goe to the reſcue if the enemie followed.

                     <p>Now muſt ye vnderſtande that vetweene the two armies there <note place="margin">The extreame could kept the 2. armies from execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſes.</note> was but a plaine fielde without any aduantage, which may make ſome man maruaile why they ioyned not: But on the other ſide ye muſt weete that there had not bene ſo ſharpe a winter ſeene in 20. yeeres before, neither was it only a hard froſt but withall there fell ſo terrible a ſleete that a footman could ſcarce march without fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, much leſſe the horſe, for it was ſo ſlipperie that a horſe could not paſſe a bancke of three or foure foote high. And whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the two armies there were many ſuch made for partition of lands, the ſame were as good as trenches: ſo as who ſo had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to aſſaile muſt of force haue bene wholy diſordered. This cauſed them to ſtand faſt each looking who would firſt begin this hazard or rather follie. No man would trie the paſſage, only there was ſome ſmall ſkirmiſh, and one houre before night they retired each into his quarter. The next morning they ſet themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in battaile aray diſcharging their artillerie as the day before: ſome alſo that went to ſkirmiſh, either brake or put their legges or armes out of ioynt, and more there were hurt by this inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience then by any harquebuze ſhot. The third day they ſhewed the like countenance, but could finde no meanes to ioyne without falling into great diſaduantage. But the fourth day <hi>Monſier</hi> retired a league of, not to refreſh his men (as we vſe to ſay) but to warme them vnder couert againſt the iniurie of time, for they were no longer able to beare the colde which killed diuers as well of the one as of the other. It is a manifeſt abuſe obſtinatly to labour to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſharpneſſe of the weather: for ſith euen the hardeſt things are thereby broken, much more muſt man who is ſenſible giue place: as alſo that which followed teacheth that we ought not, but vpon great neceſſitie, to make the ſouldier beare more then he may. For within a fewe daies ſuch violent and lanquiſhing diſeaſes ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon them, that in one moneth I am aſſured there dyed aboue three thouſand of ours, beſides thoſe that retired home: and I haue heard that on the other part there were as many or more that tooke the ſame courſe. Euery mans deſire to fight, together with the preſence of their Generalles, made them to beare euen to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:8683:218"/>
howbeit, if I ſhould not lye, <hi>Monſiers</hi> parte endured moſt through want of the couert and victuals that we had. Some Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of horſe of both campes were lodged within halſe a league or three quarters of a league each of other: howbeit when they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their lodgings they were all ſo ſterued with colde that they had no mindes to moleſt their enemies, not ſo much as to giue one alarum, as if there had bene ſome perfect truce betweene them.</p>
                     <p>On the morowe after the departure of <hi>Monſiers</hi> armie there <note place="margin">The Lord Admirals en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe voide of his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded effect.</note> fell out a braue occaſion, which the <hi>Lord Admirall</hi> had before fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene, and was reaſonably hotly purſued, which neuertheleſſe had not the hoped ſucceſſe. He geſſed that the <hi>Catholickes,</hi> who the daies before were lodged half along the hedges, would (being got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a little aloofe) ſcatter into the good villages, which in déede they did, ſo as in the bodie of the armie there remayned none but <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers</hi> owne perſon, the artillerie, the <hi>Suitzers,</hi> three or foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſe, and about twelue hundred harquebuziers. The reſt were ſome one league, ſome two leagues of. Now, about nine of the clocke in the morning, ſo ſoone as the Princes horſe were arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, they ſent foorth twelue or foreteene thouſand harquebuziers with foure ſmall peeces, determining to ſet full vpon the bodie of the enemies armie, which was but a ſmall league and a halfe of. They knewe well enough that there was a ſmall brooke with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers foords ouer it, which by the report of their guides they tooke not to bee very difficult: alſo hauing ouer night diſcouered and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the guardes thereof they found them forceable. Thus they marched making a braue head: and when they came to the paſſage which was within a quarter of a league of their campe, they found it kept by ſome footmen, who doubted no ſuch matter. The ſame did they charge very liuely, but could not force it, &amp; ſo ſtayed there vpon the ſkirmiſh. Their campe hauing hereof taken a very hot alarum, began to ſhoote of Canon after Canon to call in their ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered people, and very certaine it is that at the beginning they were greatly aſtonied: then their Captaines prouided for the reen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing of the guard of this paſſage: howbeit, within a good quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an houre after the <hi>Lord Admirall</hi> ſet vpon an other paſſage which was alſo as well defended: but could they haue bene wonne there was ſome likelihood that their armie might haue bene ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken: For before they could haue had the ſuccour of a thouſand men, wee ſhould at the firſt comming haue ſet in their faces 1500. horſe and 6000. harquebuziers, which would haue ſhaken them
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:8683:219"/>
ſhrewdly. About two houres after, being encreaſed they planted ſome peeces vpon a riſing: and after ſome ſhot on each ſide the colde cauſed euery man to retire.</p>
                     <p>As well the gentrie as common Souldiers on both ſides did <note place="margin">The retract of both the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies through the extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the colde.</note> much murmure againſt their Captaines, in that without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite they were made a pray vnto the froſtes and colde, as alſo they complayned that famine aſſaulted them, ſo as if they would not prouide for them in ſafe &amp; fortified places, they being no loger able to endure ſuch extremities, would place themſelues. Hereto was there no contradiction, for their Captaines entents did concurre with their deſires. The <hi>Catholicks</hi> went to lodge beyond <hi>Loyre,</hi> about <hi>Saumure:</hi> The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> returned to <hi>Montreuill-bellay and Touars.</hi> In this laſt action I conſider that many good occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions doe fall out when the armies are lodged ſcatteringly, which ſhould diſpoſe their leaders to watch diligently for feare of trying one vnfortunate houre. At the leaſt ought they to labour to be able with <hi>Alexander</hi> to ſay: <hi>I haue ſlept ſoundly, for Antipater hath watched for me.</hi> Some there are that thinke that the readers can gather but ſmall inſtruction in the view of things not performed, which they tearme vnperfect workes: but I am not of their minde. For whenſoeuer any action together with the circumſtances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is truely ſet downe, albeit it reacheth but halfe the way, yet may there ſtill bee ſome fruite gathered thereof: euen as men may take ſome examples by ſuch as liue but to the third or fourth parte of the common courſe of mans life: for vertue will ſomewhat appeare in all parts of mans age or actions, and this ſhall cauſe me yet to ſet downe here one bould attempt, which albeit it came not to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, is neuertheleſſe worthie to be knowne.</p>
                     <p>The Countie of <hi>Briſſack</hi> was the dealer and attempter thereof <note place="margin">The Earle of Briſſackes bould enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and what came of it.</note> during the aboade of both armies. He was bould, and for his age very wiſe: but his exceſſiue deſire of glorie did euen rauiſh him to high and difficult attempts. The Lords <hi>Admirall and Andelot</hi> were lodged in the towne of <hi>Montreuill-belay</hi> with their cornets which were great. In one of the ſuburbes at hand was there alſo two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies of footmen in the rou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

For by reaſon that vppon the way from <hi>Saumure</hi> there were in a great ſuburbe beyond the riuer ſixe or ſeauen regiments of footmen, the towne was couered on that ſide: On the other ſide
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:8683:219"/>
there were great mariſhes a league about, which could not be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but in certaine places, alſo nine or tenne Cornets of horſemen lodged in the villages on the hether ſide, who beate the waies both night and day. All this ſo aſſured the towne as there was ſmall likelihood that it could fall into any daunger. Now as in theſe ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warres men haue alwaies had good aduertiſements, by reaſon that the ſecrete enemies are ſtill hidden in the parties bowels, ſo the ſayd Countie was firſt aduertiſed of the ſmall watch kept in the towne: ſecondly that by going two leagues about out of the high way he might come, without the daunger of our horſemens watch. Howbeit he would not truſt hereto: but for his better aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance requeſted a <hi>French</hi> Captaine and an <hi>Italian</hi> by night to goe and diſcouer the truth. One of them did aſſure me that they came to the foote of the wall, and with a long pike and a corde with an yron hooke vpon it, they gat vp (for it was but lowe) and about nine of the clocke at night came euen to the <hi>Lord Admirals</hi> lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and returned againe vndeſcried. He vnderſtanding of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie was very glad thereof, and therevpon layed his purpoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid in maner following. Himſelfe would with a thouſand cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and nimble harquebuziers &amp; fiue hundred horſe depart in ſuch time that he might come to <hi>Montreuill-bellay</hi> by three of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clock in the morning, ſo to haue at the leaſt two houres of night to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour his retraict if he ſhould faile of his purpoſe: but in caſe he did compaſſe it he ſhould haue made great fires about the Caſtle, ſo to aduertiſe the <hi>Catholicke</hi> armie which was at <hi>Saumure</hi> to march with all ſpeede to his ſuccour, as aſſuring himſelfe not to be forced without the Canon, neither is it to bée doubted but in ſixe houres they might haue bene there. So doing he ſhould take two notable Captaines in the middeſt of their aſſurance, and 100. gentlemen of name: moreouer he ſhould diſperſe this aduantguard there lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, which would neuer haue abidden the comming of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> ſuccour, ſo ſore would they haue bene aſtonied, yea &amp; peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture other inconueniences might haue enſued. I for my parte who was then there &amp; haue wel viewed both the inſide &amp; the outſide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſtate of the affaires do not think the execution therof to haue bene vnpoſſible: But as it is requiſite that God ſhould watch ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſleep &amp; vpon the preſeruation of cities: ſo when the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was vpon his way to performe his enterpriſe, he light vpon an vnlooked for miſhap which ouerthrew all his entent. For hauing to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> effect ſee forward with 12. ladders &amp; his men well reſolued, being
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:8683:220"/>
within two good leagues of the towne, by chaunce he met with two hundred <hi>Proteſtants</hi> horſemen that were going to beate about who ſeeing this great troope of horſemen and footmen in the fielde, did ſuddenly returne and giue the alarum both to the towne and to the other quarters of the horſemen, whereby the Countie was forced to retire. Afterward the <hi>Lord Admirall</hi> cauſed greater watch vpon the waies and to beate the fieldes oftner, albeit he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knewe of this enterpriſe nor my ſelfe neither, vntill after the peace concluded. Truely I doe greatly commend this valiant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe of this yong noble gentleman, to whom the only daring to attempt it was an honor. Howbeit, I meruaile not that the <hi>Lord Admirall</hi> neuer doubted any ſuch matter, for he muſt, as a man ſhould ſay, haue foreſeene it by inſpiration. Neuertheleſſe, it is good for a man when he is neere a great power and ſuch reſolute Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to haue a double care, and to thinke that the deſire of honor will furniſh them of wings.</p>

Thus moſt of the troop departed to take their lodgings, ſo as there remayned but few vppon the place who ſetteled themſelues halfe a league from the paſſage: whereof it enſued that the gard was very weake, neither could it approch neere inough to heare or giue alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum to the enemies gard from time to time according as was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, ſo to haue made them beleeue that our whole auantgard had bene there lodged.

Nowe the Duke of <hi>Biponts</hi> caſe is farre otherwiſe: for notwithſtandinge he were a valyaunt
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:8683:222"/>
valyant Prince, yet did he not any thing neere approch the milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſufficiencie of the other: and a great helpe and eaſe it was for him that he was accompanied with the <hi>Prince of Orenge, Countie Lodowicke,</hi> &amp; <hi>Countie Wolrad</hi> of <hi>Mansfield,</hi> beſides other braue French Captaines, and two thouſand footmen and horſemen of the ſame nation that ioyned with him. His number of <hi>Germaines</hi> was fiue thouſand <hi>Lance knights</hi> and ſixe thouſand <hi>Reiſters.</hi> With this ſmall armie did he paſſe forward in purpoſe to ioyne with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces power.</p>
                     <p>The King vnderſtanding that he prepared for their ſuccour, did <note place="margin">The lets to keepe the Duke of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponts army from ioining with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> immediatlie appoint a ſmall armie vnder the leading of the Duke of <hi>Aumale</hi> to withſtand him: and doubting of the weakneſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he alſo ioyned thereto another vnder the gouernment of the D. of <hi>Nemours.</hi> Theſe two bodies vnited did in footmen exceede the Duke of <hi>Bipont,</hi> but in horſe were inferiour vnto him.

Howbeit howſoeuer the matter had fallen out, had it not bene wonderful in an aſſalt to ſee the horſemen fight among the footmen on either part?

In <hi>Fraunce</hi> wee haue alreadie had ſixe generall, like as wee had in the ciuill warres of <hi>Burgundie</hi> and <hi>Orleance,</hi> and as well the one as the other were infringed: but the ſeauenth which was concluded at <hi>Arras</hi> was durable and holpe to reſtore <hi>Fraunce:</hi> by which example it may bee inferred that our ſeauenth ſhoulde bee good: albeit it were to be wiſhed wee neuer came to thoſe tearmes: for to wiſh to bee ſicke that wee might recouer health may ſeeme impertinent. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech God to prouide therefore according to his good pleaſure: Trulie euerie man ſeeing the Realme flaming in warres ought to ſet before his eies Gods wrath and diſpleaſure, and the ſame againſt himſelfe rather than agaynſt his enemies: where nowe ſome doe ſaie <hi>Theſe bee the Proteſtants who through their hereſies doo ſtrrre vp Gods wrath againſt them:</hi> Others doe replie: <hi>They bee the Catholikes who with their Idolatries do prouoke the ſame.</hi> And thus in theſe diſcourſes no man accuſeth himſelfe. In the meane time the firſt thing that wee ought to doe is in theſe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſal calamities to examine and accuſe our owne imperfections to the end to amend them, &amp; then to loke vpon others mens faults. Likewiſe when we ſee a ſhort &amp; counterfait peace, we ſhould ſaie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we deſerue no better, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, according to the prouerb, when we are ouer the bridge wee mocke the ſaint, &amp; moſt of vs returne to our vanities and accuſtomed ingratitude.</p>

                        <pb n="457" facs="tcp:8683:233"/>
Howbeit it is a commendable affection which deſireth peace, I meane a good peace (for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bad are verie cut throats) becauſe therby <note place="margin">The diuers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of thoſe that long after warre and how they haue bene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for.</note> pietie and vertue doth ſeeme to reuiue: whereas contrariwiſe ciuill warres are the ſhops of all wickedneſſe, which good men doe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre. The time hath bene that of both parts their haue ben diuerſe that toke no great delight in hearing peace ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of; of whom ſome ſayd, <hi>That it was an vnworthie and vniuſt deede to make peace with rebols and heretikes who deſerued grieuous puniſhment:</hi> yea, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in their ſpeeches vntill their diſeaſe were cured on this ſorte. If they were warriors they were inioyned to march formoſt at an aſſault or in a ſkirmiſh, ſo to kill vp theſe wretched <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> of which puniſhment by that time they had twice taſted, they ſoone changed opinion. As for the reſt which were either cleargie men or of the long robe, by telling them that they muſt part with halfe their rents to paie the ſoldiour they conſented to the peace. To be briefe, whatſoeuer their pretence were, whether pietie or iuſtice, ſure their paſſions were cruell. Other there were euen among the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> which did no leſſe reiect the peace as tearming it to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but treaſon, but had it bene neuer ſo good they woulde haue ſaid as much, becauſe the warre was their nurſemother and riſing. One good waie to reduce them to reaſon were to propound (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of neceſſitie thereof) the cutting off of their paies, or the leaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome lones of them, ſo would they long after ſome good end: For take from many of theſe people their profites and honour, then will they iudge more ſincerely of matters. Alſo for counſayle in waightie matters we ought to chooſe thoſe that ſerue <hi>God</hi> and are endued with greateſt diſcretion, for they ſtill preferre the common wealth before their owne commodities and affections.</p>
                     <p>I will likewiſe ſpeake of another ſort of people who indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie <note place="margin">Againſt ſuch as like of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie peace and miſlike euery warre.</note> do like of all kinds of peace, and miſlike of euerie kind of warre: who if they might be aſſured in quiet to eate their wortes and laie vp their crops, could well enough let euerie time ſlide, yea albeit at euerie of the foure quarters of the yere, they ſhould haue halfe a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen good baſtonadoes. Theſe haue in my opinion, locked vp &amp; hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their honours and conſciences in the bottome of ſome coffer. The good Citizen ought alwayes to beare a zeale to the common wealth, alſo to looke farther than to liue in ſhamefull bondage. To conclude, in theſe affayres reaſon ought to be our guide, which doth admoniſh vs neuer to enter wars vnleſſe a iuſt cauſe and great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie conſtraineth vs, for warre is a moſt violent and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

remedie, which in healing one wound maketh more, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not to bee vſed but extraordinarily: whereas contrariwiſe we are alwaies to wiſh for peace: I meane not ſuch peace as may be preſumed to be ſtedfaſt &amp; not vniuſt: for the falſe ons do not deſerue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> title but rather to be tearmed traps &amp; ſnares, as was the ſame of the ſecond troubles.
