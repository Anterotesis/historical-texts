            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Where many of the People of God, in Scorn called <hi>Quakers,</hi> came to appeal for Juſtice from the Illegal Proceedings of the Cruel Informers, who acted by Virtue of ſeveral Warrants granted forth by <hi>Robert Thoroton</hi> Juſtice of the Peace; there being about 20 Appeals which were promiſed to be tried at this Seſſions, and but three of them put in, the manner of their Trials was as followeth, as near as can be remembred.</p>
                  <p>Upon the 8th day of the 11th Mo. as afore-ſaid, the Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93326:33"/>
ſate the Council for the Informers ſpoke to the Juſtices and the reſt of the Court, that <hi>it would be a Diſhonour to the King, and to his Honourable Juſtices of Peace, that the Appeals ſhould be tried; for if they were, it was as much as if the Iuſtices had not done according to Law, and if it ſhould be brought in for the Appellant, it would be a Diſhonour to them,</hi> or Words to that Effect.</p>
                  <p>The Council for the Appellant, <hi>It is not any Diſhonour to the King, or his</hi> Juſtices, <hi>but whether the Informers acted according to Law or no, that is the Queſtion; and if any look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be grieved contrary to Law, they may be tried by a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of twelve men, which the Law doth allow;</hi> and further, he deſired the Tryals might be in the Informers Name, and not in the Name of the King, but it would not be granted. So when the Juſtices had ordered the Appeals ſhould go on to Tryal, a Jury was impannelled and ſworn, and the Warrant of <hi>Robert Thoroton</hi>'s Conviction of the Meeting at <hi>Blythe</hi> ſuch a Day, betwixt the King of the one Part, and <hi>Iohn Sayton</hi> and the other Appellants on the other part, by which Warrant the ſaid <hi>Iohn Sayton</hi> was fined 20 l. for ſuffering a Conventicle at his Houſe (as they ſaid) in the Pariſh of <hi>Blythe.</hi> So the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were called and ſworn.</p>
                  <p>Witneſs, <hi>I was there on that Day, and there were ſeveral People met, but were all ſilent, and no Words ſpoken amongſt them but did not ſee Iohn Sayton there.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Council for the Appellant,</hi> Now in the firſt place, foraſmuch as there was neither Preaching, Praying nor Reading, as their own witneſs doth teſtifie, therefore it was no Conventicle.</p>
                  <p>2dly, Being they cannot prove he was there, therefore how can it be judged, that he did either wittingly or willingly conſent to that Meeting, if they could make it a Conventicle, with much more to that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Informers Council,</hi> Now as to the firſt, although there was neither Preaching, praying nor Reading, yet it was evident enough that they met under a pretence of a Religions Exerciſe, &amp; ſeeing there was more then five, &amp; not of <hi>Iohn Sayton</hi>'s Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, therefore it muſt needs be a Conventicle. And as to the 2d,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93326:33"/>
ſeeing they cannot prove he was there, we muſt leave it to the Conſciences of the Jury, whether he did willingly conſent to that Meeting, or no.</p>
                  <p>So when the Council had ſpoke on both ſides, <hi>Peniſton Wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> one of the Juſtices, who ſate in the Chair, as Judge of the Court, ſtood up and ſpoke to the Jury to this Effect, and ſaid, <hi>Although there was no viſible Exerciſe that can be proved, yet the</hi> Quakers <hi>ſay, they worſhip God in Spirit and Truth, and we know their Manner is, to ſit ſighing and gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Counſellor <hi>Leake</hi> being for the Appellant, asked the ſaid <hi>Thomas Sharpe, VVhether he was to have part of the Fine by the Oath he had taken?</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>Nay:</hi> He was then asked, <hi>VVhat he did at</hi> Blythe <hi>that day, and what was his Ruſineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and he anſwered, <hi>To look after Meetings.</hi> So this we leave to ſober People, to judge whether he was concerned or nay, he being one of the Informers.</p>

                  <p>Jury, <hi>For the Appellant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this Verdict coming in, <hi>Peniſtone VVhaley,</hi> one of the Juſtices (the reſt of them being pretty moderate) bid them <hi>Go forth again;</hi> but one of the Jury-men ſtood up &amp; ſaid, <hi>They were agreed, and they had conſidered it very well;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he fell into a great Rage, and flung off the Bench, and ſaid, <hi>You deſerve all to be Hanged,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>they were as ill as Highway-men,</hi> and Curſed them, and further ſaid, as if <hi>He hoped the King would take away Iuries, for this way will not do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then Lawyer <hi>Athrop,</hi> the Appellant's Atturney, anſwered and ſaid to the Court, <hi>You know how Iudges have been reproved for threatning Iuries, and ſtriving to force them contrary to their Conſciences,</hi> or words to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>So the ſecond Jury came in, and was asked, <hi>If they were agreed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They ſaid, <hi>Yes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Court, <hi>Do you find it for the King or the Appellant?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Jury, <hi>For the Appellant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which Verdict was to the great Satisfaction of moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who had heard or known of the Informers Cruelty and Ungodly Proceedings.</p>
                  <p>Upon the nineth day, being the next Morning, the Court ſate, again, and proceeded in order to a Tryal of <hi>VVilliam Hudſon</hi>'s of <hi>Little-Greenley,</hi> near <hi>Redford,</hi> for which he ſtood convicted by <hi>Robert Thoroton,</hi> and fined 20 l. and <hi>VVilliam Hudſon</hi> was called, and did appear, and was bidden to come up to the Bar, but as he was coming up, one pulled off his Hat, and <hi>Penistone VVhaley</hi> ſeeing that, bid <hi>give the man his Hat again,</hi> ſo <hi>VVilliam</hi> put it upon his Head, and for ſo doing <hi>P. VVhaley</hi> fined him 5 l. and committed him to Priſon, and ſaid, <hi>VVe need no Iury for that.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:93326:34"/>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> That theſe two former Juries were impannelled by the Sheriff according to Law, being all ſubſtantial Men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Exception when they were ſworn, and only intended to try the Cauſes depending; but the judicious Care of the Jury men not ſuting the Humour of ſome of the Juſtices in bringing in their Verdicts the day before, muſt now all be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned off, and to work they go to impannel a new Jury to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their Ends; and one <hi>Billige</hi> was called and placed the Fore-man, which is or hath been Bailiff to <hi>P. VVhaley,</hi> and one <hi>Howett</hi> that is his Clark, and others whom they pleaſed. So the Jury being ſworn, and the Witneſſes alſo, which were two Informers, viz. <hi>Thomas Sharpe</hi> and <hi>Obadiah Anthony,</hi> and another poor man, which did ſay, <hi>VVe ſaw many people met together about ſixteen, but they were ſilent, without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any words; but they could not ſay, they ſaw</hi> William Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>there. Thomas Sharpe</hi> was asked, <hi>If he knew</hi> William Hudſon? and he ſaid, <hi>Yea, and that is he,</hi> pointing at one, of which ſeveral took notice of him, <hi>VVilliam Hudſon</hi> being then in Priſon [A Notorious Forſworn Informer.]</p>
                  <p>The Appellant's Council ſeeing their Illegal Proceedings in impannelling another Jury, whom they pleaſed, and would not admit of any Exception, nor have regard to Law, would plead no more, but did forthwith riſe up, and ſaid, <hi>If this be your Law, I have done,</hi> or words to that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>But the Informers Council made uſe of his Silence and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture to their own unjuſt Ends, &amp; wronged him, ſaying to the Jury, <hi>You are upon the Matter of Fact, and you ſee the Caſe is ſo clear that their Council hath nothing to ſay; therefore you need not ſtand long about it, but bring it in for the King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the Jury went out, but notwithſtanding their illegal choice of them, in hopes of a ſpeedy and free Verdict to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their Ends, yet it proved far otherwiſe, as will be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the ſequel.</p>
                  <p>For after they had waited a long while, and the Jury came not in, they ſent a Bailiff to know <hi>if they were agreed?</hi> then he returned and ſaid, <hi>They are not agreed, and they think they ſhall not agree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:93326:35"/>
So when they had waited very long, and had done their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Buſineſs, they ſent again to them, <hi>That if they would have Information in matter of Law, they would inform them:</hi> So the Bailiff brought them into the Court, and <hi>Peniſtone Whaley</hi> ſaid, <hi>Are you agreed?</hi> and <hi>Billidge</hi> the Foreman ſaid, <hi>We are Eight that would bring it in for the King, and there are Four that will not agree thereto.</hi> Peniſtone Whaley, <hi>Why, what Four are theſe that will not agree?</hi> One of them ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>In the firſt place, I am not ſatisfied that</hi> William Hudſon <hi>did wittingly and willingly conſent to the Meeting at his Houſe; and 2dly, there being neither preaching nor pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor any viſible Exerciſe of Religion, it cannot be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Informers Atturney ſaid, <hi>That as concerning it being a Conventicle, the</hi> Quakers <hi>themſelves did grant, and ſeveral of them that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> This was falſe; for none that were at that Meeting had paid any Fines; but by virtue of <hi>Robert Thoroton</hi>'s War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the Officers and Informers had taken their Goods, and becauſe they did not put in their Appeals, this is called a Confeſſion of the Fact.</p>
                  <p>And ſo they went out again, but could not agree, and about Eight by the Clock at Night one of the four being weak, and ill of a Cold, and wanting Refreſhment, ſomething condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, partly through the Threats of <hi>Peniſtone Whaley,</hi> threatning them, who ſaid, <hi>If they could not agree, there they were likely to ſtay until they dy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>So at laſt they delivered in a Private Verdict againſt the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellant, after the Court was adjourned which t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Court: So the next day the Jury appearing at <hi>Newark,</hi> ſome of them being diſſatisfied with what was done, deſired to know of the Juſtices, <hi>If it was not lawful to go out again, that they might conſider better of it, in regard they had agreed to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Verdict, becauſe they were threatned to be kept without Meat Half a Year, and believing the other part of the Jury would have more Liberty?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Juſtices told them, <hi>It was not lawful to do it, but was a Cheat to the King, and a Diſſembling with God Almighty.</hi> But the Appealant's Atturney deſiring to prove the Lawfulneſs of it, was threatned to be <hi>Bound to his Good Behaviour if he ſpoke anything before the Verdict was delivered in open Court.</hi> So at laſt they were forced again to condiſcend, and the Verdict was given in againſt the Appealant, although it was contrary to their Conſciences, being Forced thereunto, as ſome of them declared in open Court, and to this day ſome of them remain diſſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>So the Court being now ſate at <hi>Newark,</hi> and a Jury im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pannelled in order for another Tryal of <hi>William Hudſon,</hi> he being the Appealant, the Goaler gave <hi>William Hudſon</hi> leave to be there.</p>
                  <p>The Jury being now impannelled, <hi>Pen.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Robert Thoroton</hi> replyed, <hi>That's the</hi> Quakers <hi>Worſhip, the Wickedeſt Thing in the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſaid the Man, <hi>I would gladly do Equity.</hi>

                  <p>So they went out, and ſome of the Jury being not ſatisfied concerning the Meeting, being it was in Silence, did think to have found it for the Appealant, as they have confeſſed; but preſently they procured one <hi>Obadiah Anthony,</hi> an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who told them, <hi>That there was Preaching, and they were kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
