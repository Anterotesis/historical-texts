            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="1">i. The fyrſt token is, when the day in ſomer often dooeth chaunge: as in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning inclinyng to rayne, after to darkenes and after to winde, ſpecially windes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge fourth of the Southe.</p>

               <p n="3">iij. The thirde, when vpon the grounde are many Flies fliynge nere the grounde, that is a token that the ayre is corrupte.</p>
               <p n="4">iiij. The fourth, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtarres are like ofte to fall or ſlippe, this is a token that the ayre is inflamed, and full of venimous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours.</p>
               <p n="5">v. The fifte, when there doth appere in the ayre a Comete or a ſlidyng Starre, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaieth in <hi>Mytauris.</hi> It ſignifieth greate warre, ſheddinge of bloud, and the death of a greate multitude of people, the deſtruction of many Townes, drownynge of ſhippes thorow greate tempeſtes of the

               <p n="6">vi. The ſixte figure is, when it dooeth often lighten and thundre, and ſpecially when it commeth out of the South.</p>
               <p n="7">vij. The ſeuenth, when many windes blowe or come forth of the South, for they corrupt the ayre.</p>

               <p n="2">ii. Sometimes it doth ingender thorow the vapors and corruption of the Skie and Elementes, or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

               <p n="3">iii. Sometimes it doth ingender throw the mixting of them bothe.</p>
               <p n="1">i. The plage is ſomtime ingendered, thorowe the vapours and corruptions co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the earth, as we doo dayly ſe out of Priues, Dikes, filthy Canels, ſtandinge muddy waters, being neare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where the people doth reſt and ſleape a nightes, &amp; thorow this the ayre becometh infect in hir ſubſtance and qualitie, and that onely in ſome places. And this particuler corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion commeth euery day. And thorow the ſame commeth often Peſtilente Feuers, whiche often doo deceyue the Phyſicion, which doo not take them for to be the feuer peſtilenticall. The Plage or Peſtilence commeth likewiſe ſometimes thorow the ſtinke of deade bodies, aſwell of mankinde as of beaſtes. Alſo it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth thorow ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Mudde, ſtinking Pooles and waters, and this dooeth corrupt the ayre, and this peſtilence is ſomtimes vniuerſall, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perticular.</p>
               <p n="2">ij. Secondarely, the Plage is ſomtime ingendred thorowe the vapoures and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions

               <p n="1">i. And firſt for the ſame euery chriſtian creature ſhalbe aduertiſed by the word of Ieremy the prophet, which commaundeth that euery creature ſhall eſchewe the euil and folowe the good waies, and that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentantly with a meke harte ſhal confeſſe him of his offences and this is the moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt medecine in the plage time.</p>
               <p n="2">ii. The ſecond, that euery perſon flie the places infect if it be poſſible. And they that can not avoide the place, let them abſtain
<pb facs="tcp:2690:7"/>
of all thynges cauſing putrefaction, aſmuch as is poſſible, like as is ouermuch copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion between man &amp; woman, and the ſouth winde whiche naturally is infectiue. And therefore ſhall euery perſon kepe the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes locked in the morninge till eyght of the clocke ſtanding againſt the ſouthe.</p>
               <p>Alſo they ſhall auoyde all maner of ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng ſauours, as of ſtables, ſtréetes, kanels welles, ſtanding mudde waters, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of all maner of foule ſtinking carion, or dead bodies. And moſt of all of all maner of olde ſtinking Vrines and waters, for in ſome houſes, they doo keepe it two or thrée dayes longe, and in ſome houſes are ſome kanels running vnder or aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grounde: where greate ſtinke ingendreth &amp; remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and all this doeth ingendre great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction. And that is the cauſe that more people be infected &amp; diſeaſed more in thoſe places where ſuche are, then in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where none ſuche is. Likewiſe do the people more die and be infecte where pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are where they doo ſell cabuſhe &amp; wur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, for that ingendreth a daungerous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which doth infecte mankinde, when they be rotten or periſhed. And as thorow
<pb facs="tcp:2690:7"/>
odours aromaticke or good ſauours are the hertes and other the ſpiritual partes recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, renued, comforted and ſtrengthened: Likewiſe thorow euell foule ſauours, are they debelitated and infected.</p>
               <p>Therefore euery perſon ſhal ſo vſe their houſes, that no ſuche ayre or ſauour come in beyng corrupte as is aforeſayde, for the corrupt ayre is moyſt, and ingendreth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row his owne nature a putrifaction in the houſe and in the places wher they do ſlepe. And therefore ſhal you ayre and clenſe the houſes and chaumbers with light flames of fyre, beyng made with Oken wood. Alſo you ſhall after that perfume the place with theſe herbes folowynge, as Bayes, Iuniper buries, Organum, wormewood, Yſope, Rue, and Moogworte. Lignum A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes perfumed is beſt of all, were it not ſo coſtly or dere. Al theſe ayres and perfumes conforte and ſtrengthen the inward parte of the body, when the ayre entreth thorow the mouth or noſethrilles.</p>
               <p>You ſhall alſo clenſe and abſtayne of all maner of fulſumneſſe or replecion of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. For the bodies that are replete with humors are ſone infected and inflamed.
<pb facs="tcp:2690:8"/>
For <hi>Auicen</hi> ſaieth in <hi>quarto canone.</hi> That people whiche will be often filled with meate and drinke doo ſhorten their life. Alſo you ſhall avoide muche bathinge or ſweating in baumes or hote houſes. Alſo for to be conuerſant emong great congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion of people to the intent other being corrupt and infecte: doo not corrupte and infecte you, you being cleane. And when you come not emong the congregacion or company of people, then ſhall you vſe this followinge.</p>
               <p n="1">i. Firſte in the morning, when you doo riſe, you ſhall eate a quantitie of hearbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace or rue, well waſhed with a litle ſalte and one or two cornels of nuttes wel clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And when you can get none of this, then ſhall you take a crumme of bread dep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in good vineagre and eate nexte your hert, and ſpecially when the aire is darke, miſty and not clere. And it is not good in the plage time for to walke in the townes or vilages, but rather to tary at home with in the houſe, then to goo forthe.</p>
               <p n="2">ii. Secondarelye, you ſhal ſpreade or ſprinkle the houſe (and ſpecialy in ſommer) with vinegre, with roſes, with vine leues.
<pb facs="tcp:2690:8"/>
And it is good that you dooe often waſhe your handes in water and vineagre, and then often to ſmel the handes when they be dried. Alſo al ſoure and ſharpe ſauoures are then holſome for to be ſmelled on, as well in winter as in ſommer. And it was for bodden me to ſhew it vnto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons in Rome, where I was conſtrayned for to go from houſe to houſe I beyng a ſtudient and prentes there, where I went dayly to miniſter and dreſſe the people, and tooke but onely a crumme of bread, or a pece of a ſpounge beyng depped in ſtrong vyneagre and the ſame helde I before my mouth &amp; noſe for to ſmel. For all ſoure ſauours ſtop the fluxe of humours, and dooe not ſuffre the venemoſite or corrupcion to entre the bodye.
