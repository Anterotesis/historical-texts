            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Mr. <hi>Stevins</hi> the Meſſenger, whoſe Induſtry firſt diſcover'd and ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed it, prov'd that ſhe own'd it to him, pretending at firſt that the Copy was her own hand-writing, but afterwards he ſaw her write, and found hers a ſcrambling ugly hand, far different from the Manuſcript; and then ſhe told him, ſhe kept two men in her houſe to write it as ſhe dictated to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of whom the notorious <hi>Sing,</hi> formerly a Coffeeman and Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, was one.</p>
            <p>4. Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> declar'd upon his Oath the utter falſhood of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious ſtory of his being Rack'd or in any kind Tortured but that on the contrary he was very civilly Treated at all times by Capt. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> and alſo by his Lady in the time of his ſickneſs, and that he made his diſcovery freely and voluntarily, and was only led thereunto by the Power of Truth, and to disburthen his Conſcience of ſo horrid a Crime. And Mr. <hi>Boyce</hi> and ſeveral others were preſent to have teſtified and confirmed the ſame, but it was not thought neceſſary, that <hi>Lie of hers</hi> Stabbing it ſelf by its own improbabillity, and being ſo notoriouſly Contrary to the Laws and Practice of this Nation. 'Tis Popery that needs an Inquiſition to ſupport it, and delights in Cruelties and Tortures, and Extorts Confeſſions by Racks and Strapado's; the Proteſtant Religion, and the generous Engliſh temper, disdain ſuch Barbarities.</p>
            <p>5. Mr. <hi>Fowler</hi> the Vintner upon his Oath inform'd the Court, with the grounds of his ſuſpecting <hi>Corral</hi> the Coach-man mentioned in the Libel pag. 3. <hi>viz.</hi> From his own words, but denied utterly that he ever bid him lay it upon any, or told him of any Money that was to be got by it, or any thing of that kind, giving ſo punctual an account of the whole matter, that the Court was ſatisfied. Mr. <hi>Fowler</hi> did nothing but what became and was the duty of every honeſt Man in that affair.</p>
            <p>As to the Priſoners defence, it was very inconſiderable, her Romantick Spirit was much abated, and ſhe talk'd abundantly more like a <hi>Midwife,</hi> than ſuch a <hi>Politician</hi> and <hi>Stateſwoman</hi> as ſhe would be accounted; only ſhe called two Women and a Man as Witneſſes, but two of them could ſay
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60327:3"/>
nothing material, the third was the before mentioned Coach-man's Wife, who ſaid her Husband was at the time mentioned in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and had Irons on, but acknowledged ſhe had acceſs to him and never was beaten, or any thing of that kind, as in the Libel is pretended.</p>
            <p>'Tis alſo obſervable, that the ſaid Coach-man had upon Oath diſown'd all that Tragical ſtory that <hi>Cellier</hi> reports of him, but did not appear now in Court.</p>
            <p>Then the BARON in a grave and ſolid diſcourſe ſumm'd up the Evidence, and the Court being ſo full that the Jury could not conveniently come together to Conſult, did for that reaſon withdraw, but preſently return'd, and brought her in <hi>Guilty.</hi> At which the People gave a general ſhout, yet ſhe had the Confidence, even after Conviction, to mov'd to be <hi>Bailed;</hi> but that not being Grantable by Law, ſhe was ordered back to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where ſhe now remains, with much better accomodations from the Captains Civility, than ſhe deſerves or could expect from a Perſon ſhe had ſo baſely and cauſleſly abuſed, were not his <hi>Generoſity</hi> as imcomparable as her <hi>Malice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the 13 of <hi>Sept.</hi> ſhe received the judgment of the Court, which was to ſtand Three times in the <hi>Pillory,</hi> Firſt at the <hi>May-pole</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> Secondly in <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> and Thirdly at <hi>Charing-croſs,</hi> and ſome of her Books to be Burnt at each place before her face by the Common Hangman, and alſo was fined 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and one Years impriſonment, and after that time expired, and the Fine paid, to give ſecurity for the good behaviour during Life.</p>
            <p>There were at this Seſſions Eleven Perſons Condemned to die, Six Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Five Men, one burnt in the hand, and Three to be Whipped.</p>
