         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TRVE RELATION
OF THE
Proceedings of the Governour and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of the Massachusets in New: England, against
Samuel Gorton and his Accomplices; with the grounds
and reasons thereof, examined and allowed
by their Generall Court holden at Boston
in November, 1646.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>AMVEL GORTON lived sometime at
<hi>Plymouth,</hi> where his behaviour was so turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and offensive both to the Magistrates
and others, as they were necessitated to
drive him out of their Jurisdiction. From
thence hee went to <hi>Roade-Island,</hi> where hee
began to raise sedition, and to make a party
against the Authority there; for which hee
was apprehended and whipped, and so sent
away. From thence (with some others whom hee had gathered
to his part) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee removed to <hi>Providence,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Roger Williams</hi>
then lived. Hee (with some others) opposed his sitting down there
as an Inhabitant, onely in regard of his present distresse, they gave
way for his abode for a time. But being once housed, hee soon
drew so great a party to him, as it was beyond the power of Mr.
<hi>Williams</hi> and his party to drive them out, or to rule them there; so
as both parties came armed into the field each against other, and had
fought it out, had not Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> used meanes for pacification.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100163:4"/>
Hereupon many of the chiefe of <hi>Providence</hi> sent messengers with a
Letter to the Governour and Councell of the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> desiring
aide against <hi>Gorton</hi> and his company; but they were answered, that
not being within our Jurisdiction nor consederation we had no
ground to interpose in their quarrells. Soone after some of those
men tendred themselves and their lands to come under our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and were received.</p>
            <p>There live neere to <hi>Providence</hi> two small Indian <hi>Sachims</hi> called
<hi>Pumham</hi> and <hi>Socononoco,</hi> who though they are as free as the great
<hi>Sachim</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Nanohigganset:</hi> Yet <hi>Myantonimo</hi> the then <hi>Sachim</hi> of
of <hi>Nanoligganset</hi> (being a very proud and sterne man) kept them in
great awe. This poore <hi>Sachim Pumham</hi> had a large parcell of land
neer <hi>Providence,</hi> very convenient for plantation, which <hi>Gorton</hi> and
his company (being now about 13, or 14.) taking notice of, and
fearing they should not be able to keep their power long where they
were, dealt with <hi>Myantonimo</hi> for this parcell of land, promising him
a good parcell of <hi>Wampam</hi> for it. And because they knew that
<hi>Pamham</hi> was the true owner of it, they dealt with him also; but he
refusing to sell it (for hee dwelt upon it, or very neare to it) they
caused <hi>Myantonimo</hi> to send for him, and having drawn a Writing
purporting the sale thereof for a certaine consideration to bee given
to both of them, <hi>Myantonimo</hi> signed it, and hee for feare of <hi>Myanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo</hi>
set his mark to it also, not knowing what it was. But when
<hi>Gorton</hi> tendred him the consideration for it, hee utterly refused it, it
being the Indians manner not to account any thing sold, till the
party have received the thing it is sold for.</p>
            <p>But upon this colourable title <hi>Gorton</hi> and his company enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the land, and build some houses, and withall much wrong the
Indians with their cattle, and having <hi>Myantonimo</hi> their friend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
themselves very insolently toward the poor Indians, who (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no friends or meanes to relieve themselves) came and tendred
themselves and their lands to the government of the <hi>Massachusets,</hi>
who (by order of the Court) gave notice thereof to <hi>Myantonimo,</hi> and
appointed him to come or send to the next Court at <hi>Boston,</hi> to shew
his title or interest (if hee had any) to the said <hi>Pumham</hi> and <hi>Socono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

or their lands. At the time appointed hee came, and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that they were his vassalls, but it appeared clearly both by a

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lting from Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and the testimony of some other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
in those parts, and of divers other Indians no way related to

them, that they were free <hi>Sachims;</hi> so as <hi>Myantonimo</hi> having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to reply, the Court received the two Indian <hi>Sachims</hi> with their
subjects and lands under the government and protection of the
<hi>Massachusetts;</hi> and upon that writ to our neighbours of <hi>Providence,</hi>
intimating the same to them, and advising <hi>Gorton</hi> and his company,
that if they had any just title to the lands they possessed, they should
come, or send some for them to shew the same to the Court, and
offered them safe conduct. This letter from the Court they tooke
in great disdaine, and returned scornfull and menacing answers by
word of mouth, and a good time after they wrote a letter to the
Court full of reproach and blasphemies, not onely against the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
but against the Churches and Ordinances, as by the Copy
thereof hereafter following will appeare. Notwithstanding these
provocations and daily wrongs offered to those few English their
neighbours (who had formerly submitted themselves to our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment)
wee sate still neare halfe a yeare, and before we attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
any thing against them, wee advised with the Commissioners of
the united Colonies, who (upon testimony of their insolent and
injurious courses, and perusall of the letter they sent to us) left them
to us to proceed according to Justice. Whereupon the Court sent
againe to them by two of their members, who carryed letters (to
require and perswade them to come and give satisfaction,) and a safe
Conduct withall; but they entertained those Messengers as they
had done the former, threatening to whip one, whom they tooke
along with them; and sent us word, that if wee had any thing to
say to them, wee should come to them, and wee should have justice
there, and that if wee came with force, they would meet us half the
way. Our messengers returning with these scornfull answers, the
Court resolved to send some force to fetch them in; and in the
mean time there came a second letter from them; (the Copy whereof
is hereafter also set downe) but before wee sent forth our souldiers,
wee wrote to them to this effect: <hi>Viz.</hi> That although the injuries
and provocations wee had indured from them were very grievous,
yet that our Justice and moderation might appeare to all men, wee
had condescended so farre to their owne proposition, as wee would
send some Commissioners to them, to heare their answers and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
and if thereupon they would give us such satisfaction as
should bee just, wee would leave them in peace; if otherwise, wee
would right our selves by force of Armes: And signified withall,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100163:5"/>
that wee would send a sufficient guard with our Commissioners; for
seeing they would not trust thems<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lves with us upon our safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
wee had no reason to trust any of ours with them upon their
bare curtesie. Accordingly about a week after wee sent three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
and 40 Musqueteers with them, with instructions, first
to speak and treate with them, and to require satisfaction according
to Justice, and if it were denyed, then to take them by force, and
bring them prisoners to <hi>Boston;</hi> and to take with all so much of their
substance as should satisfie our charges. By the way as they went
they met with another letter from them, letting them know, that
they feared them not, but were prepared for them: And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they had fortified themselves in one house (some 12 of them)
and had lined the walls with earth (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>usket proofe) and had made
Flanckers, and provided victualls, &amp;c. to indure a siege. So that
when our Commissi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ners came to the place, they would admit no
parly. But after a while, by the mediation of some of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
they were content to parley, and offered to referre the cause
to Arbitrators, so as some of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hem might bee of <hi>Providence,</hi> or of
<hi>Roade</hi> Island. Our Commissioners were content to send to us
to know our minds about it, and in the meane time sate still. Such
of the Court as could meet, returned answer that their Proposition
was neither seasonable nor reasonable, nor could it bee safe or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
for us to accept thereof: 1 Because they would never
offer nor hearken to any terms of agreement before our souldiers
had them in their power. 2 Because the ground of their Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
was false, for wee were not parties (as they pretended) but
equall Judges between the <hi>Indians</hi> and others who were complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
and themselves, (and yet in a case of warre, parties may bee
Judges.) 3 They were no State, or Body politique, but a few
fugitives living without Law or Government, and so not honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for us to joyne with them in such a way of reference. 4 The
parties whom they would referre it unto, were such as had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by us, and all the Governments in the Country, and so not
likely to bee equall to us, nor able to judge of the cause: and their
blasphemous and reproachfull writings, &amp;c. were not matters fit
to bee composed by Arbi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ement, (being deeply criminall) but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to bee purged away by repentance and publique satisfaction, or
else by publique punishment. For these and other reasons, the
Commissioners were required to proceed according to their Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100163:5"/>
And thereupon they intrenched themselves about the
house, and in few dayes forced them to yeeld, and so brought them
to <hi>Boston,</hi> where they were kept in prison till the Court sate, and
had their dyet from the Cookes (as good meat and drinke as the
Towne afforded.) The next Lords day they refused to goe to the
Church assembly, except they might have liberty to speake there, as
occasion should be. They were answered by some of the Magistrates
that it appertained to the Elders to order the affairs of the Church,
but they might presuppose they should not bee denyed such liberty,
speaking words of truth and sobernesse. So in the afternoon they
came, and were placed in a convenient seate before the Elders.
Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> the Teacher taught then (in his ordinary course) out of
<hi>Acts</hi> 19. of <hi>Demetrius</hi> speech for <hi>Diana</hi> her silver shrine. After Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Gorton</hi> desired leave to speake, which being granted, hee tooke
occasion from the Sermon to speake to this effect, That in the
Church now there was nothing but Christ, so that all our Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
Ministers, and Sacraments, &amp;c. were but mens inventions,
for shew and po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p, and no other then those silver shrines of <hi>Diana.</hi>
He said also, that if Christ lives eternally, then he died eternally, and
other speeches of like kinde. And indeed it appeareth both by his
speeches and letters, that it was his opinion, that Christ was incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in <hi>Adam,</hi> and was that image of God, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and that the chiefe worke and merit lay in his <hi>Inanition,</hi> when
he became such a thing, so meane, &amp;c. and that his being borne
after of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and suffering, &amp;c. was but a manifestation
of his suffering, &amp;c. in <hi>Adam.</hi> Another of them said that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
was Christ, and so was borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> They cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Magistracy among Christians an Idol; yet they did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
a Magistracy in the world to bee subjected to as an Ordinance
of God, but onely as naturall; as the father over his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and an hereditary Prince over his subjects.</p>
            <p>Their first appearance before the Court was upon the Lecture day
at <hi>Boston,</hi> before a very great Assembly, where first the Governour
declared the cause and manner of all the proceedings against them,
and their Letters were openly read, and they had liberty to object,
and anwers were given, as followeth:</p>
            <p>First, to their plea, That they were not within our Jurisdiction;
it was answered: 1 If they were not within ours, yet they were
within the Jurisdiction of one of our confederates, who had refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100163:6"/>
them to us. 2 If they were within no Jurisdiction, then was
there none to complaine to for redresse of our injuries in way of
ordinary Justice, and then we had no way of relief but by force of
Armes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to their plea <hi>Of persecution for their Conscience, &amp;c.</hi> It
was answered, that wee did not meddle with them for their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
otherwise then they had given us occasion, by their owne Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and free speeches amongstus, for wee wrote to them about ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Controversies onely, and gave them no occasion to vent their
blasphemies and revilings against the Ordinances of Religion set up
with us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for their title to the <hi>Indians</hi> lands: wee had divers
times desired them to make it appeare; but they alwayes refused,
even to our Commissioners, whom (according to their owne
motion) wee sent last to them: and since they were in prison,
wee offered them to send for any witnesses they would name
to us for that end, but this also they refused. So that our
title (by the Indians surrender) appeareth good, and having
regained possession, we need not question them any further about
that.</p>
            <p>Their Letters being read and their Subscriptions acknowledged,
they were demanded severally if they would maintaine those things
which were contained therein. Their answer was, that they would,
in that sense they wrote them, and so were returned to prison. The
next day they were brought before the Court severally to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
upon particulars, (many of the Elders being desired to bee
present) because they had said they could give a good interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of every part of their Letters. But the interpretation they gave
being contrary to the words, they were demanded if they would
then retract those words, so plainely different from their pretended
meanings. But this they refused to doe, saying, that then they
should deny the Truth; for instance in one or two. Their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were directed, one of them, <hi>To their Neighbours of the Massachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets:</hi>
and the other, <hi>To the great honoured Idoll Generall of the Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chusets,</hi>
and by a messenger of their owne delivered to our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and many passages in both Letters particularly applyed to
our Courts, our Magistrates, our Elders, &amp;c. and yet upon their
examinations about their meanings in their reproachfull passages,
they answered that they meant them, of the corrupt estate of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100163:6"/>
in generall, and not of us. So, whereas in their Letter they
charged it upon us, as an errour that we teach, <hi>That Christ dyed
Actually onely,</hi> when he suffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate;</hi> and before,
onely in <hi>Types,</hi> &amp;c. upon their examination they said, that their
meaning was, that his death was actuall to the faith of the Fathers
under the Law, (which is in effect the same which we hold:) Yet
they would not retract their words they had written. The Elders
conferred many houres with them before the Court, and by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
there of they discovered divers blasphemous opinions, which
they maintained, we will instance one which was mentioned before,
delivered by <hi>Gort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, viz.</hi> that the Image of God wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was
created, was Christ; and <hi>Adams</hi> loosing that Image was the death
of Christ, and the restoring of that Image in the Regeneration, was
the resurrection of Christ: and so the death of him that was borne
of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was but a manifestation of the former. Master
<hi>William Tompson</hi> one of the Elders had spent some time with them
before in the prison about the opinions which they held forth, and
they had professed their agreement with him (for substance) in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
point, so as he came to the Court with a purpose to speak in their
behalf, but when he heard themselves discover thus upon their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
examinations, he shewed how he had beene deluded by them,
For they excell the <hi>Iesuites</hi> in the art of equivocation, and regard
not how false they speake, to all other mens apprehensions, so they
keepe to the rules of their owne secret intentions. Being asked why
they spake against the Ordinances of the Ministery, Sacraments, &amp;c.
seeing the Scripture allowes them? They answered that they were
ordained onely for the time of Nonage, but after the Revelation
was written, they were to cease, because we finde no mention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of
them in that booke.</p>
            <p>They were unlearned men, the ablest of them could not write
true english, no not in common words, yet they would take upon
them to interpret the most difficult places of Scripture, and wrest
them any way to serve their owne turne. As for instance, Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
pressing <hi>Gorton</hi> with that in <hi>Act.</hi> 10. Who can forbid water, why
these should not be baptised. &amp;c. He interpreted thus, who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
but these h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve beene baptised, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eing they have received the Holy
Ghost, &amp;c. so he allowed them to have beene baptised. This shift
he was put to, that he might maintaine his opinion, <hi>viz:</hi> that such
as have beene baptized with the Holy Ghost, need not the baptisme
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100163:7"/>
of water. Divers dayes were spent both by the Court and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in labouring to bring them to repentance, but all in vaine. They
continued obstinate. Whereupon they agreed to sentence them,
but first they brought them in publique before a great Assembly,
and there (out of their Letters and Speeches) they laid upon them
this charge, <hi>viz.</hi> they were found to be blasphemous enemies of the
true Religion of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of all his holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and likewise of all Civill Government among his people, and
particularly within this jurisdiction. Then they were demanded,
if they did acknowledge this charge to be just, and would submit
to it, or what exception they had against it? They answered, they
did not acknowledge it to be just, but they fell into some cavilling
speeches, so they were returned unto prison againe. Being in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
they behaved themselves insolently towards their keeper, and
spake evill of the Magistrates, so as the keeper was forced to threaten
them with Irons, to keepe them quiet.</p>
            <p>After all meanes used to reclaime them, and not prevailing, they
were brought before the Court to receive their sentence, which was
this. <hi>Gorton</hi> and six more of them, were to be sent to severall townes,
there to bee kept to worke for their livings, and to weare an Iron
chaine upon one leg, and not to depart the limits of the Towne,
nor by word or writing to maintaine any of their blasphemous or
wicked errours upon paine of death, except in conference with any
of the Elders, or any other allowed by some Magistrate to conferre
with them; and this to continue during the pleasure of the Court.
Three of the Company (because they had not their hands to the
Letters) were set at libertie, two of them upon a small ransome as
prisoners taken in warre, and the other, freely, for that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them in his Masters house, where they were taken; a fourth
being found to be a plaine ignorant young man was discharged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
onely enjoyned to abide a time in one of our Townes, but hee
went away and returned no more, contrary to his promise. There
were two other who were brought in after; (but not by force) the
one of them disclaiming to have any hand in the Letters, was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
presently; the other was kept a while in prison, and after
upon his submission &amp;c. was released.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on</hi> and the other fix remained in the severall Townes all that
Winter; and then in regard of their wives and children (who were
like to be much distressed by their husbands absence) they were set at
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100163:7"/>
liberty, and banished upon paine of death if they were found in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part of our jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>After the Court had passed sentence upon them for their confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we sent to fetch so many of their Cattle, as might defray the
charges they had put us to, which amounted to about one hundred
and sixty pounds, but the Cattle came not to so much, for we left
every of them a part for the support of their families, and some of
them had no Cattle at all.</p>

                  <head>To our Neighbours of the Massachusets.</head>
                  <p>VVhereas we lately received an irregular note, professing its
forme from the Massachusets, with four mens names
subscribed thereunto, as principall authors of it, of the chiefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
you; We could not easily give credit to the truth thereof,
not onely because the conveyers of it unto us, are knowne to bee
men, whose constant and professed acts are worse, then the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting
of mens hands; but also, because we thought that men
of your parts and profession, would never have prostrated their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to such an act. But considering that causlesse enmity you
have against us; the proofe wherof, every occasion brings forth;
Wee cannot but conclude, that no act so ill which that ancient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will not bring forth her seed unto. For wee know very well,
that it is the name of Christ called upon us, which you strive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst;
Thence it is that you stand on tip-toe, to stretch your selves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
your bounds, to seeke occasion against us; (So) as you might
hide your sinne with <hi>Adam,</hi> bearing the world in hand; it is not
your desire to contend with us; But some civill breach in our cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which you onely seeke to redresse. Whereas neither you, nor
any (in way of truth) can finde wherewith, to bring us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Censure of a disorderly course of walking amongst
men: And as for the way of that ancient spirit of accusation of
the brethren, we weigh it not, knowing him to be a lyer, (or in the
abstract, a lye) from the beginning, yea and the father of it also,
which thing you cannot know, though it were told unto you.</p>
                  <p>Whereas you say, <hi>Robert Cole, William Arnauld</hi> with others, have
put themselves under the Government and protection of your Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100163:8"/>
which is the occasion you have now got to contend; we
wish your words were verified, that they were not elsewhere to be
found, being nothing but the shame of Religion, Disquiet, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
of the place where they are. For, we know neither the one
nor the other, with all their associates and Confederates, have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to enlarge the bounds, by Kinge <hi>Charles</hi> limited unto you.</p>
                  <p>Behold therfore in this your act, a Map of your spirituall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
(to use your owne phrase) for we know that the Spirituality
of your Churches, is the Civility of your Commonweale, and the
Civility of your Comonwealth, is the spirituality of your Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
the wisdome of man, being the whole accomplishment of them
both; of which Tree, you delight dayly to eate (finding it faire and
beautifull) to gaine Conformity with your maker. In these
your Dissembling subjects; grossly profane amongst us, but full
of the spirit of your purity, when they are with you, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the brand your selves have set upon some of them, the Cause
wherof was never yet removed, though it abide not upon their
backe; Nor yet the Cause of your Commitment of them unto <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
according unto your Law, for if that were removed, you
should doe them wrong, in not resuming your vomit into its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Concoction againe; Nor are we ignorant of those disgracefull
tearmes they use, and give out against you, behind your backes,
their submission therfore can bee to no other end, but to satisfie
their owne lusts, not onely conceived, but in violent motion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Neighbours, who never offered the least wrong unto
them, only the proposition of Amity, is object sufficient, for these
mens enmitie.</p>
                  <p>Even so the passions of sin, which are by the Law, having force
in your Members; you going about with great labour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
to satisfie them by your submission unto the word of God,
in your Fasting, and feasting, in Contributing, and treasuring, in
retirednesse for Study, and bowing of the backes of the poore, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth in labour to maintaine it, and in the spirit of that hireling,
raising up, your whole structure and edifice, in all which you
bring forth nothing but fruit unto death, some labouring for a price
to give for the keeping of their soules, in peace and safe estate and
Condition, and some to have their bodies furnished with riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and ease, and further then the Lord Jesus agrees with these,
you mind him not, nay you renounce and reject him, and with

nor who they are, professing them under a mediate Call of Christ,
though formerly, they have beene Called immediately by him, her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
showing your selves to be those, that destroy the Sacred ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God: For if you make Christ to be that to day, in state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ministers; which he was not yesterday, and that in the
tyme of the Gospell also, (to speake acording to your Law) to be
found in them both, you therin affirm, that he hath beene that to
his ministers, which now he is not, and to make the Son of God to
have beene that which now he is not, is to make a Nullitie of
him, not to be at all, for he is the Lord that changeth not, no not
a shadow therof is found in him, so that you plainely Crucifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

So that as you know not, how Christ, conversing with his
father in heven, is found on the earth, amongst the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers,
no more do you know, how in his conversing with <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi>
on the earth, he concludes himselfe to be in heaven, with
his father. On this foundation hangeth the whole building of
your Doctrine, concerning the sufferings of Christ, you Annihilate
the Cros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and prepare no better a place then Purgatory, for the honourable
fathers of our Lord: For you conclude, that Christ dyed in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
and purpose God, in the time of the Law, but actually onely
when he hanged on the Crosse in the dayes of <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>

                     </gap>pes and shadowes of the law, but
in the truth, and substance, when hee appeared borne of the Virgin
<hi>Mary:</hi> So must you also conclude that the fathers under the law,
were only saved, in purpose and Decree, in Type and shadow, but
actually and substantially onely at the Comming of Christ in the
flesh: therefore deale plainely with those that depend upon you for
instruction (as your Ancestours in the papacie have don) and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
a place of purgatorie, provided for them in the meane, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, your Doctrine hath no foundation. For if you raise up

                  <p>So that as farre as these men are from beinge honourable and

the things that concern the Kingdom of our God, they are infinitly

is right that we are about to do, neither is our purchase a pretence,
but precedentiall, not onely in this Civill respect, but may also
admonish all men, to take heed, how they depend upon false and
self-seeking interpreters, when both themselves, and they that
have the vision, are ignorant of the Contract, and Covenant of
God. Thence it is, that you teach, that the spouse of Christ, upon
Contract with her Lord, may conceive the seed of immortalitie, and
bring forth fruit unto God, when as yet the day of mariage, that
great Feastivitie, and solemnization, of the Consolations of God,
is not yet comne, witnesse your prorogation thereof, if not to
the Descension of Christ from heaven unto the earth, to Raigne
certaine years, yet to the Calling of the Jewes, whom yee your
selves are, according to the flesh, and to the destruction of that Man
of sinn whom yee so stoutly maintain, What is this, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime

yet subdued, for that is the right they expect to injoy by you,
for some of them committed part of their supposed right unto us,
professing it was, that they might have help, to injoy the rest; But
when they saw, wee would not be Abetters unto them without,
much lesse contrary unto Covenant, then they flye unto you for
help, Their possession, beeing a meere intrusion, as all the Natives
know and ever exclaymed against them for the same, And so may
our Countrymen also, whose eyes are not dazled with envie, and

                  <p>But wee profess right held, according to no such interest, but

with the nature of all fruit arising from their accord and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie,

Shame and Contempt of the people, shall (thorow that angell of

(though earthly) Orations that are made amongst you, by your so

Death: they are all for mercy and forgiveness, when they are out of
the Judgment hall, but let <hi>Pylat</hi> enter in thither; and then, nothing
but Crucifie him, Crucifie him; be their accusations, and witnesses,
never so false: even so, in your dealings with men, in way of your
Jewish brother hood, your law is all for mercie, to Redress, reform,
and for preservation, both of soule and bodie; Do but enter into
the Common hall, and then, as <hi>Pylat</hi> asked (am I a Jew?) so do you,
Doe I sit, or speake here, as a brother? I tro not, I am now in a
higher sphere, then that (though they be acknowledged coheirs
with Christ) can ataine unto, therfore if witness be brought in,
and Oath taken, though never so untrue, your consciences are
purged by law, and your power must have tribute payd unto it, so
far as mens Names, to bee branded with infamie, estates, depryving
women and children of things necessarie, and precious lives of men
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100163:11"/>
can extend themselves, to contribute any thing thereunto; so
that the professed mercie, and Clemencie of your law, to exercise
censures only for amendment of life, and recoverie, comes unto this
issue, as much as in you lies, to send both soule and body downe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hell for ever without redresse, and all hope of recovery.</p>
                  <p>But your houre, and the power of Darknesse, is known what it
is, either to have mens persons in admiration because of advantage;
or else, to seek all occasions against them, to brand them with all

in the Temple, you know not how to streatch out your hand, or

those two olive trees, and two candlestickes, standing before the God
of the earth? are thesegu ltie and vile persons, out of whose hands
(by the power of your ministries) you are delivering and releasing
the world? then indeed are your wayes justifiable: But if these bee
the Just, Chosen, and peculiar friends of God, yea such, as without
which, his truth and Righteousnesse are not justified, his wisdom,
and holinesse maintained and upheld in the world, in point of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by Christ, then are your wayes wicked, and to bee abhorred;
for in your professed Course, you are they, by whom these are

Corpes unburied in your streetes, and yet you know not what you
are doing, no more then you know what these witnesses are, whom
you are altogether ignorant of, for your Libraries never saw them,
and you see not but by their eyes, for these are two, and never more,
nor yet lesse, yea ever the same, they are olive trees, else no witnesses,
and also Candlesticks, else both the former faile, yea, are not at all.
Wee must tell you what these are, else wee cannot declare how you
kill them, for it is not our intent to open unto you the house of the
treasures, the silver and the gold, and the spices, and the precious
oyntment, nor the house of our armour, because you take all as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100163:12"/>
execrable, and put all to a profane use that commeth from us; but
these two witnesses are the life and death of our Lord Jesus; or, in
the true language of heaven also, the strength and the weaknesse of
Christ, for hee was crucified through weaknesse, but hee liveth by
the power of God: this is the word of the Lord in <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> Not
by an army, nor by power, and so deprives him of all strength, but
by aspirit, that the greatest mountaine, or loftiest hill in the world
cannot stand before, but becomes a plaine, which with facility and
ease hee passeth upon; thence it is that hee doth not onely lay the
top or the head stone of all, but also the lowest in the foundation,
and then onely is the voice of shouting heard, Grace, grace in the
house for ever; and then doth the day of small things become the
day of joy and triumph, yea, of parting the rich spoiles and prey
of all the world, for then hee that doth but turn and lift up his eyes
he cannot looke besides that great flying book of the Curse that is
gone forth over the whole earth.</p>
                  <p>Without these two witnesses jointly uttering themselves in every

nor testimony of God is given, or brought in at all, but a meere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge

these two pipes of the olive trees emptying themselves into the

Most impious it is to put to death two such Noble witnesses, that
have power to shut heaven that it raine not in the dayes of their
prophecying; to turne the waters into bloud, and to smite the earth
with all manner of plagues as oft as they will, whom that spirit that

God, as above, which is infinite, not admitting of circumscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
or containment, for the heaven of heavens cannot containe
him, yet have you not dared to graspe and inviron that power in the
heavens, and therefore have resolved and concluded that hee onely
rules upon the earth in these dayes by his Deputies, Lievtenants,
and Vicegerents, whereby you limit, and so destroy the holy One
of Israel; for give him that in one time, or place, which afterwards,
or elsewhere you deny him, and you make a nullity of him unto
your selves, and in so doing, you kill that other witnesse, namely,
the death or weaknesse of the Lord Jesus: for you must have man
to bee honourable, learned, wise, experienced, and of good report,
else they may not rule among you; yea and these things are of
man, and by man, as appeares, in that they onely officiate so, as
man may disanull and take it away againe; witnesse your change of
officers, constantly speaking for us herein; thus have you slaine
also the death or theweaknesse of Christ, who professeth himselfe
to bee a worm and no man, the shame and contempt of the people;
and these faith full and true witnesses thus slaine, you must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
deny buriall, and keep them both in open view in your streets,
or other wise all your pompe and glory falls to the dust whence it
came, and on which it feeds. Nor can you send your presents one
to another of your acts of Justice, power to protect, wealth, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and friends where with you gratifie each other; and where
these are thus slaine, and their corps lie in open view, none of the
gentiles, peoples, tongues, and kindreds suffering their carkasses to

and <hi>Egypt,</hi> where our Lord is crucified; but after there dayes and an
half, the spirit of life from God shall enter into them, and they shal
stand up upon their feet to the terrour of you all: Nor doe you
thinke that wee onely inveigh against the great ones of this world
for thus doing, for wee know that the basest peasant hath the same
spirit with the greatest Princes of this world, and the greatest of the
Princes of this world, hath the very same spirit wherewith the

the things you doe, whereby you cast reproach upon all the
world, in that you professe your selves a choice people pickt out of

committed adultery with her in his heart already: so also it hath
beene sayd of old, Thou shalt not forsweare thy self, but I say unto
you, sweare not at all: so that if it be adulterie, to looke to lust, it
is also forswearing a mans self, to sweare at all; if the one be adultery,
the other is perjury, if one be admitted in some cases, the other also,
so that in preaching the toleration, nay the duty of an oath, you
preach the toleration, yea the duty of adulterie it self; So that our
Lord plainly evinceth unto all mens consciences, not onely the guilt
but the folly and madnesse of the oath of man, shewing how farre
it is, either from investing into place, or demonstrating Causes, so
that hee that concludeth upon honour, and power, received from
the oath of man, or upon knowledge and bouldness, to judge in
a cause, from that testimony without the which he could not have

those shamefull lies and falsities gone out against us, and the daily

it in such a way of painted hypocrisie and false glosse unto the eye

for wee have wronged no man, unlesse with hard labour, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide

courses; what their businesse is, wee know by proofe sufficient, to
bee nothing else but that ancient errand of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> that rebellious

not bee dealt with as before, wee speake in the Name of our God,
wee will not; For if any shall disturb us, as above, secret hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites

thorow which you thinke to bee saved, which is a name given by
our Lord unto the Devill himself, as our English translate it, and
the Lord never gives name, as an empty title, but according to the
nature of the thing named; so that if hee speake, I have said yee

onely the name, but the very nature of the god of this world, and
therefore hee saith, they shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as one of those princes of <hi>Midian,</hi> whose carkasses became dung
for the earth; and hee that gives that title unto any but the true
God (that made heaven and earth) in any other sense but as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
a flat opposition against God, is re-acting that ancient spirit
of the serpent, if yee eate, you shall bee as gods, to judge of good
and evill, for which all men are set up in that kinde; even so, while
you tell the people, that by sorrow, compunction, and anxiety, and
trouble of minde, they communicate in the sufferings of Christ,
out of which condition their comfort is to flow, is nothing else
but to conclude the sonne of God to be belial, yea, to affirme him
to bee <hi>Seghnirim</hi> himself; this doth hee receive at your hands in
your ministries, for all your fawning upon him with a kisse; so
that if you will know how farre you are from communicating in
the death of Christ, take it in this parable, verily, as farre as the
weakness of God is stronger then man.</p>
                  <p>Country-men, for wee cannot but call you so, though wee finde
your carriage towards us to bee so farre worse then these Indians,
wee advise you to take things together, and what God hath joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
let none dare to put asunder: So that if you bee ashamed of
the crosse in Baptisme, bee ashamed of the Baptisme also, for such
as the crosse is, such is the Baptisme, therefore your ancestors goe
beyond you in that, to joyne crossing of the aire, and sprinkling
with the element of water together, but where ever Baptisme ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

they can no more bee separated, then his scepter and kingdom can,
for where the one is, there is the other also, and as they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident,
so are they co-apparant; So that if ever you see the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of Christ truly in use, and exercised upon any, you do as truly

and to conclude that afterwards they may bee worthy of censure,

a totall and finall falling away from the grace of God, as
your fathers have done before you; for no grace greater then the

                  <p>Behold therefore you despisers, the vanity and abomination of
all your baptismes, how prejudiciall they are to the crosse of

they never complained to us of any thing done unto this day, but
they had satisfaction to the full, according to their owne minde, for
oft wee know, in what they expresse unto us, although our wrongs
insufferable done by them lie still in the deck, for wee know
very well, wee have plenty of causelesse adversaries, wanting no
malice that Satan can inject, therefore wee suffer much, that in the
perfection and heighth of their plots, they may receive the greater

                  <p>To which end wee have not onely committed our condition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

governments of this Country, as formerly they have beene, that so
our wrongs might not appeare; therefore never picke a quarrell

wee are void of your benediction also, sprung out of the same stock

to come up to us, and bee employed according to our pleasure, in

since our comming into this Country, you have beene the violent
agents, and we the patients. To feare therefore to come amongst
you as such as have done wrong, the cause vanisheth in us, so must the

you know nothing at all, therefore such as can delight themselves
in preaching, professing, and executing of such things, as must end
as the brute beasts doe, nay take them away for present and they
have lost their honour, religion, as also their God, let such wee
say, know themselves to bee that beast and false prophet, no man of
God at all. In the meane time wee looke not on the things that
are seene, but on the things that are not seene, knowing the one are
temporary, the other eternall. Nor doe wee thinke the better of
any man for being invested into places or things that will in time
waxe old as doth a garment, neither judge we the worse of any man
for the want of them: for if we should we must condemne the Lord
Christ, as so many doe at this day.</p>

was so bad, as it would scarce have been understood, I
left it to bee corrected by the Printer, but no word to be changed:
And the reason of the word here left out, is, because it was worne

out, and so soyled in the originall as wee could not read it, and
thought good rather to leave it a blanck, then to put in a word of
our own that was not theirs.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I present thee here with certaine Observations
collected out of both their Letters, by a godly and reverend Divine,
whereby the Reader may the better understand them, and indeed
try the spirits of these men, whether they be of God or no. Now
these his Observations are ranked into three Heads: <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, their reproachfull and reviling speeches of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Magistrates of the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> which in <hi>Gortons</hi> Booke
hee pretends so much to honour, because their Government is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the State of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore I desire thee to
take the better notice of it.</p>
            <p>The second Head of his Observations directs thee to their revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
language, not onely against that particular Government, and
the Magistrates of it, but against Magistracy it selfe, and all Civill
power.</p>
            <p>And in his third Head, thou art directed to take notice of their
blasphemous speeches against the holy things of God. All which
because they are of great concernment, I beseech the Reader to
take a little paines to compare them with Mr. <hi>Gortons</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies

their purity.</p>

               <p>12 That the whole structure and edifice among us (<hi>i.</hi> the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

and that by submission to the Word of God in fasting, feast-sting,
retirednesse for study, contributing, treasuring (<hi>i.</hi> for Church
uses in severall Churches) they doe nothing else but bring forth
fruit unto death.</p>
               <p>13 That farther then the Lord Jesus agrees with riches, honour
and ease, our Magistrates minde him not, nay, renounce, and reject
him.</p>
               <p>14 That they plainely crucifie Christ,<note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> and put him to an open
shame, which the Apostle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. applies to the worst of men,
who commit the unpardonable sin, and for whom men are not to
pray.</p>
               <p>15 That our Magistrates are as farre from yeelding subjection to<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note>
Christ, as <hi>Cole</hi> and <hi>Arnold</hi> from being honourable and loyall-sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
whom they call the shame of Religion, the disturbance and
disquiet of the place, dissembling subjects, <hi>Pag.</hi> 10. as also deboist,
rude, inhumane <hi>Nabals,</hi> il-bred, apostatised persons, and felloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<hi>Page</hi> 23. with many such like speeches.</p>
               <p>16 That the things of Gods kingdome are infinitely beyond
the reach of their spirit, nor can they heare the lively Oracle, and
therefore are dumb in telling Justice.</p>
               <p>17 That the Magistrates are Jewes according to the flesh, and
stout maintainers of the man of Sin.</p>
               <p>18 That they know our Magistrates eyes are dazled with envy,<note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note>
and their ears open to lyes.</p>
               <p>19 That they judge them before their cause be heard.<note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>20 That in inviting them to their Courts for their equal-ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Justice (as they scornfully call it) they thereby strike at Christ
their life.</p>
               <p>21 That our Magistrates are like <hi>Herod,</hi> whom God smote with<note place="margin">Pag. 16.</note>
wormes, for seeking by an out-reaching and circumventing policy
to subdue <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> and like <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and the people
who out of the Judgement hall are all for mercy, but in it nothing
but crucifie him, bee their accusations, and witnesses
never so false, so (say they) in your dealings with men in way of
the Jewish brotherhood, your law is all for mercy, to redresse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
for preservation of soule and body, doe but enter into the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100163:23"/>
Common-hall, then if witnesses bee but brought in, and oath taken
though never so untrue, your Consciences are purged by law, and
your power must have tribute paid it, so far as to brand mens names
with infamy, and deprive women and children of things necessary.</p>
               <p>22 That the professed clemency and mercy of their law, is as
much as in them lyes, to send both soule and body downe to <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol</hi>
(<hi>i.</hi> the grave and hell) for ever, without redresse and all hope of
recovery.</p>
               <p>23 That their houre and power of darknesse is knowne, what
it is either to have mens persons in admiration because of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
or else to seek all occasions against them, with all manner of
reproach and ignominie.</p>
               <p>24 That their wayes are wicked,<note place="margin">Pag. 17.</note> and to bee abhorred, because
in their professed course the two witnesses are slaine by them, and
put to death; and that all their glory is to keep their corpse unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried;
and these two witnesses are the life and death of the Lord
Jesus.</p>
               <p>25 That the light appearing among them,<note place="margin">Pag. 18.</note> is nothing but the
light of <hi>Balaam,</hi> so that in seeing, they see not, but communicate
onely in the light of that Beast who put the witnesses to death.</p>
               <p>26 They tell our Magistrates, that they never come amongst
them, but they see themselves in a regiment of grosse and palpable
darknesse, and discern you to scrabble on the wall for the door of
<hi>Lots</hi> house.</p>
               <p>27. That they know not what a true witnesse is.<note place="margin">Pag. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>28 That the whole Word of God is a parable to them,<note place="margin">Pag. 22, 23.</note> as their
conversation in all points daily declare it.</p>
               <p>29 That they will not come neare our Magistrates, until they
know they beare another minde from their neighbours, whom
they call robbers, grosse dissembling hypocrites, who doe nothing
but goe about to establish such wayes as may maintaine their owne
vicious lusts, whose laws are pretended and devised, and whose pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
(they say) they renounce as diabolicall.</p>
               <p>30 Yee blind guides (say they to our Magistrates) as your fathers<note place="margin">Pag. 24.</note>

               <p>31 You set up <hi>Segnirim (i.</hi> as themselves interpret) feare and<note place="margin">Pag. 25.</note>
horrour, or the devill, by, and for the which you hope to bee

               <p>32 That their carriage towards them,<note place="margin">Pag. 26.</note> is farre worse then that of

the <hi>Indians,</hi> whom themselves cry out of to bee thieves and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; <hi>Pag.</hi> 32.</p>

               <p>34 Yee think (say they) that the crosse of Christ is nothing but
bowing down the back to every burden, and cringing and crouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the lust of every man.</p>
               <p>35 They call the generall Court,<note place="margin">Pag. 28.</note> the great Idol Generall, whose
pretended equity in distributing Justice is a meer device of man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the sleights of Satan.</p>
               <p>36 They tell the Court, that out of the kingdome of darknesse

pride and folly.</p>
               <p>37 For taking <hi>Pumham</hi> and <hi>Sachanonoco (Indian Sachims</hi>) under
their protection; they tell the Court they might have done well to
have proved themselves Christians before they had mixt themselves
with the heathen; but this was too hard for them to doe.</p>
               <p>38 They advise the Court (in scorn) to keep the <hi>Indian</hi> with them,<note place="margin">Pag. 29.</note>
where he and they might perform that worthy work of distributing
Justice.</p>
               <p>39 They tell the Court that they live by bloud.</p>
               <p>40 They tell the Court, they renounce the kingdom of darkness,
and the devill, wherein the Court delights to trust.</p>
               <p>41 They call the Court, Oye generation of Vipers.</p>
               <p>42 They tell the Court,<note place="margin">Pag. 30, 31.</note> they are not a cup fit for their appetite,
but a cup of trembling either to make them vomit up their owne
eternall shame, or else to make them burst asunder with their fellow
confessor <hi>Iudas Iscariot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>43 That the Court is either blind or audacious in desiring them

the Court, that they shall come down to them and return in safety;
which they call a verball and perfunctory offer.</p>
               <p>45 They tell the Court, that if their lusts had not prevailed
over them, they might thinke they had better employment then
to trot to <hi>Massachusets</hi> as their factors, and ordinary hackney<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:100163:24"/>
the soules and bodies of men, is nothing else but a continued act
of accusing and excusing (like the horse in the mill) which (say
they) you doe by circumstances and conjectures, as also your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have done before you, the Diviners and Necromancers of
this world, who are gone to their owne place, and have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>47 They accuse our Magistrates for maintaining <hi>Indians</hi> in<note place="margin">Pag. 33.</note>
their lying, sabbath-breaking, grosse whoredomes, stealing, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>48 That they are hypocrites,<note place="margin">Pag. 34.</note> having eyes and see not, eares and

               <p>Now had these men returned a rationall answer, it might have
been meet perhaps by a few marginall Notes to have returned some
short Reply; but both their Letters being fraught with little else
then meer raylings, and reproachfull language, it may be sufficient
thus to present them in one view together, that so the wise and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
may take a taste of their spirits, and learne from what fire it
is that their tongues are thus highly inflamed. If our Courts and
Magistrates had been in any thing to blame, what a faire and easie
way had it been to have first convinced them, before they had thus
bitterly reviled them; but thus to cut and shave, and cast all this
filth in their faces without proof or reason, argues a bold and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
spirit fitted to make combustions and confusions in the place
where they live. If indeed the Magistrates had given them any sore
provocations of returning ill language, there might have been some
excuse, but alasse, all the cause that can bee given of most of this
ill language, is nothing but writing friendly unto them, to send
some from themselves to clear up the differences between them and
the <hi>Indians,</hi> and to shew their just title to the land they possessed;
if they had kept this flood within their owne bankes, or been but
moderate in revilings, it might have been winkt at; but to fly out
into such extremity on so small provocation against their betters,
so as to call them Idolls, blind-guides, despisers, generation of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
such as crucifie Christ, men that serve their owne lusts, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
the seed of the Devill, Necromancers, Judasses, men that
live by bloud, robbers and thieves, men without mercy, among
whom Justice is dumbe, delighting in the kingdome of darknesse
and the devill, like <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> in administring Justice, whose

               <p>IF any shall say for them (as themselves now for their owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage

               <p>Now this strikes at all Magistracy, for if the office of ministring

               <p>If it bee objected, is it possible that any men should bee so grosly

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. These men seeme to acknowledge some way of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
Justice, but the mysterie lies in that word <hi>Office,</hi> they would
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100163:25"/>
have no man set up in the Office of Magistracy, distinguished from
other men, but would have such a power common to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
so that a man may judge as a brother, but not as an Officer,
and therefore they slily justifie him, who called one of our chiefe
Magistrates in the open face of the Court, <hi>Brother,</hi> and condemne
all our Magistrates, because every man doth not sit there to judge as
a Brother, <hi>Pag.</hi> 16. and their reason seems to bee drawne from this,

                  </gap>eire with
Christ, <q>is a higher sphere then to bee a Civil Officer,</q> as their
owne words intimate, <hi>Pag.</hi> 16. Now the rule is evident à <hi>quatenus
ad omne,</hi> that if ministration of Justice and judgement belongs to
no officer, but to a man as a Brother, then to every Brother, and if
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o every Brother, whether rich of poore, ignorant or learned, then
every Christian in a Common-wealth must bee King, and Judge,

ministration of Justice and righteousnesse by men as Brethren, yet
some Cakes of these mens dough have been so farre leavened and
sowred against all Civill power, as that in our Publike Courts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
demanded how murderers, theeves, and adulterers should bee
punished if there should bee no Civill power coercive, they openly
and roundly answered before many witnesses, that such persons
must be left to the judgment of God, both which not long after God

it may yet more fully appeare that these men doe abandon all civill
authority, (although this secret they will not impart unto all, but
rather professe the contrary) there is extant to bee shewen if need
were, the writings betweene a prudent man in this Country, and
one of the chiefe, and most understanding of this peculiar fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

these three assertions, 1. That there are no Ordinances, 2. That
there are no relations neither in the Common-wealth betweene ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers

nor in the families betweene husband and wife, master and servant,

               <p>6. Against Christ Jesus himselfe: <hi rend="margQuotes">they condemne our doctrine
for affirming that Jesus Christ actually dyed and suffered onely in
the dayes of <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Puntius Pilate,</hi> when hee hanged on the

               </p>

being asked in open Court what was that Christ who was borne

hee was <hi rend="margQuotes">a semblance, picture, or a shadow of what was and is done
actually and substantially in Christians;</hi> and hence the meaning
of the words may bee gathered <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. which otherwise the wise
reader may thinke to bee non-sence. <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>that they are Wisards
and Necromancers who raise a shadow without a substance (<hi>viz.
to make Christ to bee slaine in types since the world began</hi>) or
who raise the substance of him who dwels in light without a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</q>
(making no more of Christ but a semblance and shadow, as
themselves call it) for further explication of which they affirmed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100163:28"/>
in open Court that <hi rend="margQuotes">as the Image of God in <hi>Adam</hi> was Christ, (for
God they said had but one Image) so the losse of this Image by
man was the death of Christ,</hi> and therefore 'tis no wonder if they
deny Christ to dye actually onely when crucified under <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi>
because man sinned actually (which they make to be Christs death)
long before; meane while the reader may take notice with a holy
astonishment and horrour of the heavy curse of God in blinding
these bold men with such a palpable and grosse spirit of delusion
and mad phrenfies, who will make mans sinne and fall, which is the
cause of perdition of men, to be the cause of the Salvation of man, for
so Christs death is which they blasphemously make mans sinne to
bee.</p>
               <p>For further proofe that they make little use of Christ and his
death, then as hath been said, their owne interpretation of the slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the two witnesses, <hi>Pag.</hi> 17. 18. seemeth to confirme, for they
make these two witnesses the life and the death of Christ in men, the
life of Christ they call his strength, and the death of Christ they call
his weaknesse, <hi>viz.</hi> as it is, and appeares in weake, foolish, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
unexperienced, and ill-reported of men, and therefore they
blame us for killing of Christs death (for it seemes it is such a death
as may bee killed) in that wee chuse honourable, wise, learned men,
and of good report to place of rule, excluding others.</p>
               <p>Now some of these blasphemies might have been the better borne
if they had let Christ and his death alone, and his word alone, but
to call the holy word and Sermons of Salvation <hi>tales,</hi> the Sacrament
an abomination, madding and making drunke the world, to call the
Ministers of Christ who dispense Word and Sacraments, Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers

so much abused their Government in the face of the Country, yea in
open Court, their owne eyes and eares bearing witnesse thereunto,
they I say presented these abuses to the Court, as such which they

the Delinquent.</p>
               <p>And therefore that thou maist see the occasion thereof, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that an ancient woman having a Cow going in the field where
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100163:29"/>
                  <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi> had some land. This woman fetching out her Cow,
<hi>Gortons</hi> servant maid fell violently upon the woman beating and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
abusing her by tearing her haire about her, whereupon
the old woman complaining to the Deputy Governour of the place,
hee sendeth for the maid, and upon hearing the cause, bound her
over to the Court. The time being come and the Court set, <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
appeares himselfe in the defence of his maid, and would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
his maid to appeare or make answer, but said expresly she should
not appeare, and that if they had any thing against her they should
proceed with him. And though hee was lovingly disswaded by
some of the Bench not to engage himselfe but let his maid appeare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yet hee refused: but when hee could not bee prevailed with, the
action was called and witnesses produced, sworne, and examined:
which being done, hee moved for another witnesse to bee called,
which hee perswaded himselfe and the Bench was an honest wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and would speake the truth. Now shee being sworne, said,
Mr. <hi>Gorton,</hi> I can speake nothing will helpe your maid. And indeed
her whole testimony was against her and for the old womans cause,
whereupon hee openly said, Take heed thou wicked woman, the
earth doth not open and swallow thee up. And then hee demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Court if hee should have equity and justice in his cause or
no? To which was answered, if he had either plea or evidence to
produce in his maids cause it should be heard. Then hee nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one <hi>Weekes</hi> who could say something to it. <hi>Weekes</hi> was called
and required to take his oath before hee spake; at which <hi>Gorton</hi>
and <hi>Weekes</hi> both of them jeered and laughed and told the Court they
were skilled in Idols, and that was one, and stood stoutly a long time
to makeit good. Hereupon some of the Court put him in mind how
they had forewarned him of such carriages fearing he would fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
some extreames. At length the Governour gathering up the
summe of what was witnessed, commends it to the Jewry. At which
time <hi>Gorton</hi> said, the Court had perverted Justice and wrested the
witnesses, with very many high and reproachfull termes; and in
the midst of his violence throwing his hands about, hee touched the
Deputy Gove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nour with his handkerchiefe buttons about his
eares (who it seemes sate at a Table with his backe towards him)
whereupon the Deputy said, what will you fall about my eares? To
which <hi>Gorton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> answered I know not whether you have any eares or
no? and if you have, I know not where they stand; but I will not

touch them with a paire of Tongues. The Governour often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon the Jewry to attend the Cause, was as often interrupted
by him. Where upon many of their Freemen being present, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Court they would not suffer such insolencies, professing they
were troubled the Court had borne with them so long. For which
in briefe, hee was committed, but when the Governour bade the
Marshall take him away; hee bade take away <hi>Coddington,</hi> which
was their Governours name: a thing I thought meet to explaine, lest
thou shouldst not understand it by the Heads of the Presentment
here following, abusing all and every particular of the Magistrates
with opprobrious terms. But note when hee was committed upon
his mutinous and seditious speeches, <hi>Weekes, Holden, &amp;c.</hi> his abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
stopped the way with such insolency, as the Governour was
forced to rise from the Bench, to helpe forward the Command
with his person, in clearing the way, put <hi>Weekes</hi> in the stocks, and
was forced to command a guard of armed men to preserve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and the peace of the place: And this they did because of
some fore-going jealousies; and now taking occasion to search the
houses of that party that adhered to him, they found many of
their peeces laden with bullet: and by meanes hereof they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to continue their guard, whilst upon their banishment they were
forced from the Island.</p>
               <p>And however it were enough for a Book alone to relate all the

               <p>A second thing to be observed, was, that after hee had been so
deservedly whipt, some of his faction said, Now Christ Jesus had
suffered.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, although the weather was very cold, the Governour
going away after execution of Justice upon him, yet he ran a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <p>VVEe the Inhabitants of the Town abovesaid, having faire
occasions, counted it meet and necessary to give you true
intelligence of the insolent and riotous carriages of <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi>
and his company, which came from the Island of <hi>Aquednick;</hi> which
continue still as sojourners amongst us; together with <hi>Iohn Greene,</hi>
and <hi>Francis Weston,</hi> two which have this long time stood in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against us, and against the fairest and most just and honest ways
of proceedings in order and Government, that wee could rightly
and truly use, for the peaceable preservation and quiet sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
of our selves and families, or any that should have
faire occasion to goe out or come in amongst us. Also six or seven
of our Townsmen which were in peaceable Covenants with us,
which now by their declamations doe cut themselves off from us,
and jointly under their hands have openly proclaimed, to take
party with the afore-named Companies, and so intend for ought
wee can gather, to have no manner of honest order, or government
either over them or amongst them, as their writings, words, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100163:31"/>
actions doe most plainly shew. It would bee tedious to relate the
numberlesse number of their upbraiding taunts, assaults, and threats,
and violent kinde of carriage daily practised against all that either
with care or counsell seek to prevent or withstand their lewd licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
courses. Yet in briefe to commit some few of them to your
moderate Judgements, lest wee our selves should bee deemed some
way blinded in the occurrences of things, here is a true Copy of
their Writing inclosed, which <hi>Francis Weston</hi> gave us the 13. of
this present Moneth, they having also set up a Copy of the same
on a tree in the street, in stead of satisfaction for fifteene pounds,
which by way of arbitration of eight men orderly chosen, and
all causes and reasons that could bee found, daily and truly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and considered jointly together, when hee the said <hi>Francis
Weston</hi> was found liableto pay, or make satisfacton in Cattle or
Commodities, but on the 15. of this present moneth, when wee
went orderly, openly, and in a warrantable way to attach some of
the said <hi>Francis Westons</hi> Cattle, to drive them to the Pound, to make
him, if it were possible, to make satisfaction: which <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi>
and his company getting notice of, came and quarrelled with us
in the street, and made a tumultuons Hubbub; and although for our
parts wee had before-hand most principally armed our selves with
patience, peaceably to suffer as much injury, as could possibly be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

born, to avoid all shedding of blood, yet some few drops of blood
were shed on either side: And after the tumult was partly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and that we went on orderly into the Corne-field, to drive the
said Cattle, the said <hi>Fran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry,
and hollowing and crying, Theeves, theeves, stealing cattle,
stealing cattle, and so the whole number of their desperate compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
came riotously running, and so with much striving in driving,
hurried away the cattle, and then presumptuously answered, they
had made a rescue, and that such should bee their practise if any
men at any time, in any case attach any thing that is theirs. And
fully to relate the least part of their such like words and actions,
the time and paper would scarce bee profitably spent, neither need
wee to advise your discretions what is likely to bee the sad events
of these disorders, if their bloody currents bee not either stopped,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100163:32"/>
or turned some other way. For it is plaine to us, that if men
should continue to resist all manner of order, and orderly answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
one of another in different cases, they will suddenly practise,
not onely cunningly to detaine things one from another, but, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
in publike, justly or unjustly, according to their own wills
disorderly take what they can come by; first pleading necessity, or
to maintaine wife and family; but afterwards boldly to maintain
licentious lust, like savage brute beasts, they will put no manner of
difference between houses, goods, lands, wives, lives, blood, nor
any thing will bee precious in their eyes: If it may therefore please
you of gentle curtesie, and for the preservation of humanity and
mankinde, to consider our condition, and lend us a neighbour-like
helping hand, and send us such assistance (our necessity urging us to
bee trouble some unto you) to helpe us to bring them to satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ease us of our burden of them, at your discretions; wee
shall evermore owne it as a deed of great charity, and take it
very thankfully, and diligently labour in the best measure wee can,
and constantly practise to requite your loving kindnesse, if you
should have occasion to command us, or any of us in any lawfull
designe: And if it shall please you to send us any speedy answer, we
shall take it very kindly, and bee ready and willing to satisfie the

our Towne aforesaid,</head>
               <p>These are further to give you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand; Viz. That</p>
               <p>I Doe not onely approve of what my neighbours before me have
written and directed their Reasons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to a serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with us, concerning <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi> and his Company: but
this much I say also, that it is evident and may easily bee proved,
that the said <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi> nor his Company are not fit persons to
bee received in, and made members of such a body, in so weake a
state as our Town is in at present.</p>
               <p>My Reasons are, <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi> having shewed himselfe a railing and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
person, not onely in and against those states of Government
from whence hee came, as is to bee proved; but also here in this
Towne since hee have sojourned here; Witnesse his proud chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
and his upbraiding accusations in his vilifying and oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious
terms of, and against one of our Combination most wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and shamelesly reviling him, and disturbing of him, and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with him, who was imployed and busied in other private oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
having no just cause so to revile and abuse him, saying also
to him (and that of another state) in a base manner, they were
like swine that held out their Nose to suck his blood, and that now
hee and the rest of his Company would goe and wallow in it also;
which are indeed words unsufferable; and also despitefully calling
him Boy, as though hee would have challenged the field of him,
in such an inhumane behaviour as becomes not a man that should
bee thought to be fit by any reasonable men to be received into such
a poor weak state as we are in at present.</p>
               <p>Secondly, another of his Company, one who is much in esteem
with him, who openly in a scornfull and deriding manner, seeing
one of the five men that was chosen by the Towne, and betrusted in
the Towne affaires, comming towards him in the street, hee asked
of one that stood by him, who that was, the other answered him,
it was one of the five men appointed for managing of our Towne
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100163:33"/>
affaires, or the like: Yea, said hee, Hee lookes like one of
the five, which words import not onely a scorning and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of his person of whom then hee spake, but also a despising and
scorning of our Civill State, as it were trampling it under foot,
as they had done by other States before they came hither, who
were of greater strength then wee are; for which cause I cannot
see such persons to bee fit to bee received into such a State as our
Towne is.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I cannot finde these men to bee reasonable men in their
suite unto the Towne, to be received in as Townsmen, seeing they
have already had a plaine denyall of their request, and that by the
consent of the major part of the Towne, or very neare, &amp;c. and
are yet unanswerable; and also that they seeing that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to our Towne, hath brought the Towne into a hurry,
almost the one halfe against the other, in which estate no Towne or
City can well stand or subsist; which declareth plainly unto us,
that their intent is not good, but that their abode so long here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, is in hope to get the victory over one part of the Town,
but specially of those that laid the first foundation of the place, and
bought it even almost with the losse of their lives, and their whole
estates, and afterwards to trample them under their feet, as some
of their words hold forth, or else to drive them out into the same
condition, to seek out a new <hi>Providence,</hi> and to buy it with the like
hardnesse as they first bought this place; these, and many other
like reasons that may be shewed, declare that they are not fit persons
to be received into our meane and weake State.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and seeing hee who is so well knowne to bee the
ring leader unto the breach of peace, that have been so notoriously
evill to bee a trouble of Civill States where hee hath lived, that are
of farre greater force then wee are of, specially that State who have
their Commission and Authority from the Higher Powers; what
may wee then expect if he could get himself in with, and amongst so
many as wee see are daily ready to tread us under their feet, and
his, whom he cals friends, &amp;c. Surely, first a breach of our civill peace,
and next a ruine of all such as are not of his side, as their daily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
doth declare; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are not fit persons to be received into
our Towne, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If it bee objected, as some have blasphemously said,
that wee are per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecutors, and doe persecute the Saints, in not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100163:33"/>
receiving of them into our Towne-fellowship, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To this I answer, there cannot bee proved the least shew
of any persecution of those persons, either by us, or by any other
amongst us to our knowledge. For 1 they have quiet abode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, none molesting or troubling of them, nor any thing
they have. 2 It cannot bee proved but by their owne relation, the
which hath been disproved; that they were sent out from those
places from whence they came for Religion, neither are they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with here for any such matter, but rather that they themselves
in their bravery are more ready to meddle with others. 3 They
themselves and others of their followers, have rather been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers
and persecutors of the Saints of God that lived here before
they came, and doe but waite their opportunity to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
manifest in that they intend; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it cannot bee truly said of
any, that any persecution is offered by us unto them, if it could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be said of them that they are Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But if it be further objected, that we doe not give them the
liberty of men, neither doe wee afford them the bowells of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
to give them the meanes of livelihood amongst us, as some have
said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To this I say; 1 there is no State but in the first place will
seeke to preserve its owne safety and peace. 2 Wee cannot give
land to any person by vertue of our combination, except wee first
receive them into our state of combination, the which wee cannot
doe with them for our owne and others peace-sake, &amp;c. 3 Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
their necessity have been so much pleaded, it is not knowne that
ever they sought to finde out a place where they might accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
themselves, and live by themselves, with their friends, and such
as will follow after them, where they may use their liberty to live
without order or controule, and not to trouble us, that have taken
the same course as wee have done for our safety and peace, which
they doe not approve nor like of, but rather like beasts in the shape
of men to doe what they shall thinke fit in their owne eyes, and
will not bee governed by any State. And seeing they doe but here
linger out the time in hope to get the day to make up their penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths
in advantage upon us, we have just cause to heare the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of so many of our Neighbors that live in the Town orderly
amongst us, and have brought in their complaints, with many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
against them, and not to admit them, but answer them as unfit
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100163:34"/>
persons to bee received into our meane State, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now if these Reasons and much more which have been truly
said of them, doe not satisfie you, and the rest of our neighbours,
but that they must be received into our Towne-state, even unto our
utter overthrow, &amp;c. then according to the order agreed upon by
the Towne, I doe first offer my house and land within the liberty of
the Towne unto the Towne to buy it of mee, or else I may, and
shall take liberty to sell it to whom I may for mine advantage, &amp;c.</p>

scandalls held forth therein, to the great amazement of many ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
consciences in the Kingdom, who are not acquainted with his
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100163:35"/>
proud and turbulent carriage, nor see the Lion under his Lambe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skinne
coate of <hi>simplicity and peace.</hi> The Lord knowes how unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
I was personally to engage: and I trust hee will also guide mee
in answering his booke, as I shall bee farre from bitternesse: tis
true, time was when his person was precious in mine eies, and
therefore I hope and desire onely to make a righteous and just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to the many unworthy things by him boldly, ignorantly,
proudly, and falsly published to the great dishonour of God in
wronging and scandalizing his Churches, which the Lord Jesus
Christ will not leave unpunished.</p>
            <p>I know the world is full of controversies and tis my great griefe to
see my dear native Country so engaged in them, especially one god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
person against another. 'Tis my present comfort I come not to
accuse any; but to defend <hi>New-England</hi> against the injurious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of <hi>Samuel Gorton, &amp;c.</hi> but as it comes to passe oftentimes
that men wound others unavoidably in defending their persons
from the violent assaults of such as draw upon them, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they would never have done: so if Mr. <hi>Gorton</hi> receive any
such hurt (which is unavoidable) hee becomes an accessary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
by forcing mee to defend the Country, without which I
should bee unfaithfull.</p>
            <p>I know the world is too full of bookes of this kinde, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
however I am unfitted of many things I have and could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
at home would well become a relation of the late and present
state of <hi>New England,</hi> yet I shall now onely with as great brevity as
may bee give answer to such injurious complaints as hee maketh
of us. And however his Title, Preface, and every leafe of his booke
may bee justly found fault with, I shall clearely answer to matters
of fact, such as hee chargeth the severall Governments withall, so as
any indifferent Reader may easily discerne how grosly wee are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused,
and how just and righteous censures were against him for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing
the civill peace of all societies where hee came, in such a
manner as no Government could possibly beare: and for the <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies</hi>
for which hee was proceeded against at <hi>Massachusets,</hi> they
fell in occasionally by his owne meanes without any circumstance
leading thereunto.</p>
            <p>And first whereas hee accuseth us in the first page of his booke to
goe over to <hi>suppresse hereticks.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 1.</note> 'Tis well knowne we went thither

tyranny, and the heavy burthens they imposed, to which sufferings
the kingdome by this ever to bee honoured Parliament have and
doe beare witnesse to, as religious and just. And that wee might
also hold forth that truth and ancient way of God wherein wee
walke, which Mr. <hi>Gorton</hi> cals heresie. Next in the same <hi>Pag.</hi> hee
chargeth us with <hi>affection of Titles, &amp;c.</hi> To which I answer, either we
must live without Government, or if wee have Governours wee must
give them wee call such Titles as are sutable to their offices and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

Assistants, Pastors, Teachers, Rulers, Deacons, &amp;c. these are our

            <p>In his second <hi>pag.</hi> hee chargeth the <hi>Massachusets to unite with other

troublesome, (after meanes used to remove the offences taken
by Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> but to no purpose, growing still more insolent) Mr.
<hi>Smith</hi> desired him to provide elsewhere for himselfe: but <hi>Gorton</hi>
refused, saying, hee had as good interest in the house as Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>
had. And when hee was brought before Authority, stood s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to maintaine it to our amasement. But was ordered to depart and
provide other wayes by a time appointed. And not long after
there comming a woman of his acquaintance to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> divers
came to the Governour with complaints against her, being a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
for unworthy and offensive speeches and carriages used by her.
Whereupon the Governour sent to her to know her businesse, &amp;c. and
commanded her departure, and ordered the Sea-man that brought
her, to returne her to the place from whence shee came, at his next
passage thither. But <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rton</hi> said shee should not goe, for hee had
occasion to employ her, &amp;c. Hereupon the Governour (it being in
the time of a Court) sent for him, and because hee had hidde her,
stood in justification of his practiseand refused to obey the command
of the Court (who seconded the Governours order.) He was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
till hee could procure sureties for his good behaviour till the
next Court which was a generall Court, and there to answer to this
contempt. The time being come and the Court set, <hi>

               </gap>quested one of his Assistants who was present at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment

leave of the Governour to speake, complaining of his sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
carriage, and requested the Court not to suffer these abuses, but to
inflict condigne punishment. And yet notwithstanding all wee did
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100163:37"/>
to him was but to take the forfeiture of his foresaid bonds for his
good behaviour. Nay being but low and poore in his estate, wee
tooke not above eight or ten pounds of it, lest it might lie too heavy
upon his wife and children. But he must either get new sureties for
the behaviour till the next generall Court, or such time as he departed
the Government, or lie in orison till hee could: now hee knowing
his outragious passions which hee could not restraine, procured
suretles, but immediately left <hi>Plimoutb</hi> and went to <hi>Roade Island,</hi>
where upon complaint of our persecutions hee found present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
there: yet soone afterward he abused them in a greater measure
and had heavier yet too light a punishment inflicted on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and all
for breach of the civill peace and notorious contempt of Authority
without the least mention of any points of Religion on the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
part, but as before.</p>
            <p>And whereas in <hi>pag.</hi> 4. Mr. <hi>Gorten</hi> further accuseth us that they
were deprived and taken away from their quiet possessions, &amp;c. Such
was his carriage at <hi>Plimouth</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> at his first settling as
neither of the Governments durst admit or receive him into cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
but refused him as a pest to all societies. Againe in the same
<hi>pag.</hi> he accuseth <hi>Massachusets</hi> and <hi>Plimouth</hi> to have denyed them to be
in our Government, <hi>but when wee perceived the place to bee a refuge for
such as were oppressed then,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis true that <hi>Plimouth</hi> gave way to

upon <hi>Weekes</hi> his sollicitation when I was at <hi>Providence</hi> for the reasons
before mentioned, &amp;c. And for those particular relations he makes of
<hi>Robert Cole, William Arnold,</hi> and <hi>Benedict</hi> his sonne, I wave, as
not being so well acquainted with their cases, but see hee writes
with a venomous pen; onely take notice he would make it a great
crime in them to trade on the Sabbath (as it is) when himselfe at
that time denyed the sanctification of it.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 5. hee complaines that powder was traded to the Indians
and denyed to them, <hi>Answ.</hi> If it were traded to the Indians, for
my part I approve it not, it being against the expresse law of the
Country, and a large penalty annexed: but there was good reason
to refuse it to them which held such familiarity with Malignant
Indians especially during the time of their confederacy against

               <hi>Massachusets</hi> at the time of the warrant there by him specified, how
truly copied I know not: but am sure at this time he was personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under no censure of theirs.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 7. hee accuseth Magistrates and Ministers for bringing in
all the accusations that came in against them. Who but publique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
should take notice of publique insolencies? And as for Mr.
<hi>Collens</hi> his story I am a stranger to, but beleeve it is misreported as
well as others.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 8, hee manifests hee durst not live under a forraigne Prince,
meaning the Dutch, having never been false to his King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
&amp;c. with many ignorant swelling words; as if it were treason
to ones Prince to live under a forraigne State though an Ally. And
in the same <hi>pag.</hi> hee would lay the death of Mistris <hi>Hutchenson</hi> who
was mother in law to Mr. <hi>Collens,</hi> on us: although they went from
<hi>Road Island</hi> which is not under the <hi>Massachusets</hi> where shee had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
some years after her remove from the <hi>Bay,</hi> and not from the
<hi>Massachusets</hi> to the Dutch of her owne accord where they were cut
off by the Indians.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 9. he shewes how they bought lands of <hi>Myantonimo</hi> Prince
of those parts. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Hee was not the Prince of that part as
was proved publiquely at <hi>Massachusets</hi> himselfe being present. 2. He
had no proper right in it, as is shewed at large elsewhere.</p>
            <p>In the same <hi>pag.</hi> he beginneth a large letter full of railing blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
which continueth to <hi>pag.</hi> 31. and however it bee not exactly
set downe as it was sent, yet I admire at Gods providence, for hee is
falne into the snare he laid, this being brought against him to accuse
him of blasphemy, before a Committee of Parliament, who called
in his book, and referred him to the House, &amp;c. but I forbeare to shew
his folly here, which is referred to another place and his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
discovered therein.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 32. hee saith the Government of the <hi>Massachusets</hi> had no
shew of any thing against them but Religion, and yet the whole
carried on in his owne way as well as what wee now print, shewes
it was in the right of two Indian <hi>Sachims,</hi> namely <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who placing themselves under the protection of the <hi>Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chusets</hi>
complained of violence offered them by Mr. <hi>Gorton</hi> and his
company; it being our manner both in Capitals and Criminals
to dot them the like justice wee doe one to another, wherein walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the same rules of righteousnesse towards them, they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100163:38"/>
have the lesse cause to take offence at us.</p>
            <p>From <hi>pag.</hi> 33. forward, are many Letters which I cannot beleeve
al is in them, and therfore remain jealous of his sincerity in Printing
them.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 37. hee holds forth conversion to be the ground of the
<hi>Massachusets</hi> sending to them, now to that end, saith hee, they sent
a Minister. 'Tis true, there was a gracious young man one Mr. <hi>Ioh.
Bulkley</hi> then a Student, but in no ministery, went to teach to the
Company they sent to guard their owne Commissioners, and to
bring in <hi>Gorton</hi> if need required: but I dare not beleeve what hee
affirmes. And for the Copy of a Letter hee fathers upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
sent by the Government of the <hi>Massachuset;</hi> I conclude
'tis rather set downe upon memory then right, because of some at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations
I have by me to make use on elsewhere, which seeme to
hold forth the contrarry, and so I doe not credit it.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 38, &amp; 39. hee relates how their wives were frighted at
mens presenting their muskets at them, &amp;c. and suffering such hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
as occasioned death, &amp;c. Which must also bee false, for honest
men have deposed there was no such presentment, and that their
wives came freely and familiarly to them, both before and after they
were taken. So also hee affirmes our men would allow of no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
but private, or else they would dispatch them in a quarter of an
houre, which I will never beleeve, because I know the men to bee
men fearing God, and durst not proceed as hee relateth it.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

is made to the contrary, which I shall make use of before my

as though there were <hi>feare of some combination between the Indians and

conspiracy: but this I thinke you dare not deny, that <hi>Weekes</hi> one
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100163:38"/>
of your stoutest Champions, lent <hi>Myantonimo</hi> an Armour, in which
he was taken in battell against <hi>Vncus,</hi> who was under the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the English united Colonies: for which <hi>Vncus</hi> put him to
death; and in your own book you hold forth more familiarity then
becomes you.</p>
            <p>But here it will bee necessary for mee to shew you the ground of
this warre. There was a people called by the name of the <hi>Pecoats,</hi>
being a stout warlike people, who had been at warre with the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nohiggansets</hi>
many yeares, and were too strong for them; so also
were they at some distance of affection with this <hi>Vncus,</hi> who was
<hi>Sachim</hi> of a people called the <hi>Mohegans,</hi> neare the head of a River
falleth into the sea at <hi>Pecoat,</hi> The chiefe <hi>Sachim</hi> of this people of
<hi>Pecoat,</hi> was called <hi>Tatobam,</hi> a stout man. The <hi>Nanohiggansets</hi> and
these strove who should be greatest. This <hi>Tatobam</hi> envied the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
and was the first stirrer and contriver of this generall Plot,
that they might all joyne together to destroy the English; but the
<hi>Nanohiggansets</hi> refused to joyne with them, knowing if that were
once done, the next ruine must be their owne. Afterward having
subdued many small peoples, and one as great as themselves, and
and some English planting more neare then the body of our Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
though without wrong to him, or any of them, hee cut off
Captaine <hi>Stone</hi> his Barke and Company, and after this killed divers
stragling English. This st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it was against their comon Enemy, offered their service to joyn with
the English: the <hi>Nanohiggansets</hi> did no considerable service in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of the <hi>Moheges,</hi> who did as much as could bee expected, but
the <hi>Nanohiggansets</hi> rather gathered up the spoile, to the great offence
of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Moheges,</hi> seldome ingaging in any fight. The
English killed and destroyed this people utterly, so that those that
were left remaining utterly deserted the Countrey, and the English
wonne it, and are now possessed of it. After this victory, <hi>Myan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Covenants rant to this purpose, To confirme their League between
the English and them, and either to other, and to hold forth a
league of perpetuall peace between them. And in case any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
should arise between them. And in case any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
should arise between these two Indian <hi>Sachims,</hi> or their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the party offended should complaine to the Governour of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neetacut,</hi>
who was to mediate and to determine the controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his two friends and their people: And in case the injury were
great, and the party wronging would not stand to the foresaid
award and determination, then it should not onely bee lawfull for
the wronged to right himselfe by force of Armes, but for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
party also to assist the innocent in that kind. And to this they
all firmed as before.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nanohigganset Sachim</hi> never regarded this Covenant, the
<hi>Mohege Sachim</hi> ever faithfully observed it. But <hi>Myantonimo</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nohigganset</hi>
had thoughts now to prosecute the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to destroy the English, (the <hi>Pecoets</hi> Nation being rooted out by
Gods just judgement as before) and travels farre and neare to draw
all the Indians in the Countrey into this horrid confederacy with
him; but this <hi>Vncus</hi> would not bee wonne, though he would have
taken his daughter in marriage, but ever acquainted the English
with his working. At length an inferiour <hi>Sachim,</hi> subordinate to
<hi>Nanobigganset</hi> affronts him and his men, hee complaines to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
they send to this inferiour <hi>Sachim,</hi> hee sleights their admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
goes on his course; whereupon the other demands leave to
make warre upon him, not requiring any aide. Still the English
forewarne the other party of the evill they were like to bring upon
themselves; till at length they professe they have had peace enough, &amp;
now it is time to war, Whereupon the English give way to <hi>Vncus</hi> to
revenge himselfe, he doth it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other are beaten. Now <hi>Myantonimo</hi>
he prepares an Army of above 1000 men, and comes upon a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
upon <hi>Vncus</hi> without any respect to Covenants, and took <hi>Vncus</hi>
at advantage, not with above 300 men; by which meanes they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
him every way in his Fort, which stands upon a point of Land
between two Rivers. <hi>Myantonimo</hi> so dispersed his men to prevent
their flight, as <hi>Vncus</hi> making a desperate salley with almost his full
force, routed the other, slew neare upon an hundred, and forced
them to fly: But Mr. <hi>Weckes</hi> one of <hi>Samuel Gortons</hi> company (as I
am credibly informed) lending the Great <hi>Sachim</hi> a complete Armor;
and having it on in the fight, was not able to fly so fast as his men,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100163:39"/>
and was taken by this meanes. Yet such was <hi>Vncus</hi> respect still to
the English, as hee kept him till hee sent to the English, <hi>viz.</hi> to the

doe with him, who lived next to him, Hee wished him to follow
their owne Custome, and to deale with him, as if hee had not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
with him, or there were no English in the land to advise with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
Hereupon hee resolved to have killed him forthwith, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their Custome. But no sooner were the <hi>Nanohiggansets</hi> got
home, who had lost divers Sachims, Captaines, and chiefe men in
this fight, but they send to Mr. <hi>Gorton,</hi> &amp;c who sent a Note to <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
with a command by the bearer, that they put him not to death,
but use him kindly and returne him. This the Messenger either said
or they supposed came from the <hi>Massachusets</hi> Governour, and did

                  </gap>eetacut,</hi> who wished him to keep him priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and to advise with the Commissioners of the United Colonies
whereof they were part, whose meeting would bee ere long by
course at the <hi>Massachusets:</hi> which counsell hee followed, and entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Governour of <hi>Coneetacut (Myantonimo</hi> also desiring it) to
keep him safe for him till then, whereupon hee was brought to
<hi>Hartford:</hi> And many gifts were sent to the prisoner; which hee
bestowed like himselfe, some on him that took him, some on <hi>Vncus,</hi>
some on his wife, some on <hi>Vncus</hi> brother being a great Captaine,
and some on others where he had received kindnesses, and this was
all the ransome was paid, there being not so much as a ransome
proposed by the <hi>Nanobiggansets,</hi> nor set down by <hi>Vncus.</hi> But hee
advising with the Commissioners, they considering how many ways
besides open hostility he had sought the life of <hi>Vncus,</hi> by poyson,
secret murther, witchcraft, &amp;c. advised him to put him to death,
there being no safety for him whilst hee lived, being so restlesse in
his practice against his life; and therefore wished <hi>Vncus</hi> to proceed
with him according to their owne Custome towards prisoners of
Warre, which is to put them to death; according to which advice
he proceeded, knowing now that none of the <hi>Engl.</hi> would intercede
for him. And hereupon <hi>Vncus</hi> went to <hi>Hartsord</hi> and demanded
his prisoner, and led him to an house of his owne, out of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of the English, and there killed him, where was an English
man or two by to prevent their accustomed cruelties, in cutting off
not onely the head and hands of their prisoners when they are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100163:40"/>
dead, and make bracelets of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ore-joints of their fingers, &amp;c. but
to torture them whilst living with most inhumane cruelties. After
this, the <hi>Nanohiggansets</hi> would warre upon him in revenge of his
death; wee forbade them, and at our next meeting of Commissioners
to consult about the Weale publike of the United Colonies, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the <hi>Nanohiggansets</hi> pleaded they had taken a ransome for his
life, and his life also, which the other denyed; Wee sent for <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
and sent to the great <hi>Sachims</hi> of <hi>Nanohigganset</hi> to come also, or
appeare by Commissioners; but they sent foure Commissioners with
full authority to treate, where we found neither ransome, nor co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of ransome in the least measure. And so a truce was agreed on, &amp;
if <hi>Vncus</hi> brake it, we were then freed from our engagement to defend
him any further, for they desired no more: And if the <hi>Nanohiggan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets</hi>
broke it, then it should be lawfull for us the United Colonies to
take part with him, &amp;c. But the truth is, though before they had
so neare neighbours of the English, as <hi>Gorton,</hi> &amp;c. and till <hi>Myanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo's</hi>
Government, as they were the most in number, and most
peaceable of all the <hi>Indians,</hi> yet now they were changed, as if they
had not been the people, and had their Tutors, Secretaries, and
promptors to suggest their greatnesse and our weaknesse to them, as
his Book witnesseth, in such manner as I am confident if the <hi>Gorto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
(for I take the phrase from his owne Book here, never hearing
it before) bee suffered to live so neare them, it will bee our ruine, or
these <hi>Indians</hi> (which we desire not) in short time. I thought good
to insert this Narration thus briefly, that the Reader might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the ground of his many charges, calling God to witnesse I
know not the least falshood related in it, but many things for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities
sake omitted worthy a history; but I am now about an answer,
not an history, and therefore thus briefe. But to return.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 47. see how he scoffes at the Sabbath as if there were no
other ground for our religious observation of it, then Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi>
judgement. And in <hi>pag.</hi> 48. hee is full of many scoffs, as if hee
and his <hi>Gortonians</hi> would not, nor did shoot at all, when as I
have oath to prove they shot also at the other, but the truth is, I
heard some say that their powder was so dampe and moist as they
could not without great difficulty discharge a peece, which I well
beleeve might bee the reason they shot no more then they did.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 49. hee chargeth Captaine <hi>Cooke</hi> with breach of Articles:
And yet I have it attested upon oath, that there were none agreed on;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100163:40"/>
onely they desired they might not goe bound; which was easily
assented to, they behaving themselves quietly. And for their cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
I never heard the number to be so great by farre; but asking the
Governour of the <hi>Massachusets</hi> about them, hee professed they did
not amount to halfe their charges. And if any aske by what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
they went out of their own Government to do such an act?
Know that his former seditious and turbulent carriage in all parts
where he came, as <hi>Plymouth, Roade-Island,</hi> a place of greatest liberty,
<hi>Providence</hi> that place which relieved him in that his so great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and his so desperate close with so dangerous and potent ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and at such a time of Conspiracy by the same Indians, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the wrongs done to the Indians, and English under the

               </gap> contempt
of all Civill Government, as well as that particular, and his blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
against God needlesly manifested in his proud letters to
them, one whereof hee hath printed, and the other I have herewith
published for him. All these considered, you shall see hereby cause
enough, why they proceeded against him as a common enemy of
the Countrey. And as such an one, the said Commissioners being
then met together at <hi>Massachusets</hi> by course, for the Weale of the
whole, upon just complaint ordered and thought meet that the
Government of the <hi>Massachusets</hi> should call them to accompt, and
proceed with them so farre as stood with righteousnesse and justice:
And by their declaration thou maist easily see they went no further,
for they refusing safe conduct to come to answer to the matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, forced them upon this charge needlesly, which they
made them beare part of as before. So that here's cause enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
blasphemy for their proceeding with them I suppose.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 51. he chargeth <hi>New-Engl.</hi> Ministers to pray in the streets:
but take notice I have been there these 26 yeares, and better, but
never heard of such a practise, till I now reade it in his Book.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 52. he saith, the Governour to satisfie the people, said, <hi>we
were apprehended for divers grosse opinions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Answ.</hi> You may
see in the last Section but one there was cause enough. And yet for
Opinions, let mee tell you that you held, That that Image of God
after which man was created was Christ; and that when <hi>Adam</hi> fell
Christ was slaine, &amp;c. And as for your opinion concerning Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> by way of sad complaint told me, you denyed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100163:41"/>
any true Churches of Christ to be in the world: also Baptisme it
selfe, and the Lords Supper, Sabbath, Magistracy as it was an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
used amongst Christians. And for the Lords Supper, that
it is but a spell, the Ministers Necromancers, and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants
drunke with the juice of the grape, &amp;c. And for this last
passage here mentioned, the Reader shall have it at large in a second
Letter sent by him and his companions to the Government of the
<hi>Massachusets,</hi> concealed by himself in his Book, though he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to have printed all, &amp;c.</p>

affirming that Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> put himselfe into a passion, and stirred up

him to this effect: That hee should doe well and wisely to make such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement

that Mr.</hi> Cotton <hi>Whom hee had so much reverenced in</hi> Old England
<hi>and</hi> New,<hi> had given him a godly example in that kinde, by a publique
acknowledgement upon a solemne Fast day with many teares; That in the

their watchfulnesse over him, and faithfulnesse towards him: wherein hee

in <hi>p.</hi> 55. his great respect manifested to that government, because deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the State of <hi>England,</hi> which what it was thou maist largely
see in certaine Observations of a godly Divine annexed hereunto,
upon his owne two contemptuous and blasphemous Letters, or

found faulty.</p>

<hi>pag.</hi> 58. and come to 59. &amp;c and so the rest of his Answers to the
Questions to 64. I answer, though I know not whether hee doe
right as hee states things; yet this I know, being attested by reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
persons, That hee then maintained, <hi>that God made man after
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is owne image; and that God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> but one image, and that is Christ; and
this was the Incarnation of Christ, his exinanition by which we are saved.</hi>
And when it was objected, wee are not saved by the incarnation of
Christ, but by the death of Christ. <hi>True, saith hee, therefore</hi> Adam
<hi>fell, and so destroyed Gods image, and that was the death of Christ.</hi> When
it was objected againe, <hi>Adams</hi> fall was not our salvation, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
but the death of Christ was our salvation: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Adams</hi> fall could not be the death of Christ. Hee would by
no meanes either revoke or explaine his speech (though much ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
thereunto) to agree with the principles of Christian Religion.
Being further demanded what he then thought of that Christ in
whom we beleeve, borne of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and who suffered under
<hi>Pontius Pilate?</hi> He answered, <hi>That that Christ was a shadow, and but
a resemblance of what is done in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e and every true Christian.</hi> And now
judge good Reader, whether this be like what hee mentioneth, or
whether it were a trifle not worthy the mentioning: But if he will
be so unfaithfull as to omit it, I dare not.</p>

and yet have lived in <hi>New-England</hi> from the beginning, being
now above 26 yeares. I wish hee study not, nor affect these things,
but I much feare it.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 80. Hee tels a tale of a tub, of <hi>Myantonimo's</hi> being slain
as hee marched, which is false, for hee was put to death, and in an
house, but not upon a march. And is it to bee wondered at, that
two English were present to see the manner of their proceeding in so
weighty a cause as one Prince putting another his perfidious enemy
and captive to death, especially when they were required by the
Commissioners to forbeare their accustomed torments and to give
him honourable buriall, which they did and had thanks returned
by the <hi>Nanhiggansets</hi> for those particulars. Now if any would know
how it was done? It was onely at one blow with an hatchet on the
side of the heade as hee walked easily in the roome (expecting no

which fully dispatched him at once. And thus mnch for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

though I dare not say, nor doe I thinke they joyne with them

in many of their Councels, contri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e their sturdy answers by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,

cannot write? and who knowes not their owne answers from those
that come under your hands? And if the State of <hi>England</hi> (which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100163:43"/>
God defend) should establish your and their joynt propositions:
then were their plot accomplished: for they might and would
worke freely our ruine when as wee might not take up armes against
them, but by vertue of warrant or writ from hence procured upon
our complaints here, which also would bee six months, in ordinary
course in procuring and returning, when as in one of these all our
throates might bee cut, and those hopefull beginnings so much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by our gracious God hitherto in a high way to bee
overthrowne. Indeed wee heard further, and for my part
I beleeve it, that for the better accomplishment hereof, <hi>Samuel Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
and some of his company had perswaded the <hi>Nanohiggansets</hi> to
send the King a very large Present of Beaver and otter skins which
they should bring in, and accordingly did: but withall the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
reporter saith, that if he could finde favour with the Parliament,
then hee would rest there: but if they frowned on him, hee doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to but obtaine what was meet from the King. But the times
would not suffer him to publish this also, else I see wee should have
had all: and this take notice of, That (as the same report testified)
at his departure hee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wished them by no meanes to warre with us
the <hi>Vnited Colonies,</hi> but compound though it cost them never so deare,

the <hi>Nanohiggansets</hi> in their strength against us, yet are they neither so
many men not have so many arms, but have too many and are very
expert in them: being continually supplyed by the French and
Dutch, whose aime is chiefly at the trade of Furs, and hereby not
onely robbe us of that should helpe to maintaine our plantations
which are growing up into a Nation, but furnish the Indians with
all manner of armes, which I would to God, and humbly beseech
this High Court of Parliament to take into serious consideration,
and treate with their severall Ambassadors about it, as a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable

their Charter for the limits of it now granted, was contained
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100163:44"/>
within our line of Government: and trust I shall now receive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
Tis true also that we sent Mr. <hi>Iohn Brown</hi> furnished with these
following instruction to signifie to all that were interessed in that
new erected Government as followeth by Commission given at
<hi>New-Plimouth, Nov.</hi> 8. 1644.</p>
            <p>1. That a great part of their supposed Government is within the line of
the Government of <hi>New-Plimouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That wee assuredh knew that this ever to hee honoured House of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
would not, nor will when they shall know of it, take from us the most
ancient Plantation, any part of the line of our Government formerly granted;
it being contrary to their Principles.</p>
            <p>3. To forbid them and all and every of them to exercise any authority or
power of Government within the limits of our Letters Patents.</p>
            <p>4. To certifie them that Coweeset is not onely within said limits,
but that the <hi>Sachim</hi> thereof and his sonnes have taken protection of his our
Government. And therefore to forbid them to cuter upon any part of his or
their lands without due order and leave from our Government.</p>
            <p>Now these instructions were signed by the Governour. And Mr.
<hi>Browne</hi> going to <hi>Roade Island</hi> for this end came very seasonable
when a publique meeting was appointed for your new Magistrates
and people, (but as he reported, for a most vile end; <hi>viz.</hi> to take into
consideration a new disposall of the lands formerly given out, as if
some had too much and some too little, and for no respect of persons,
and their estates was to bee laid aside.) And here note that Mr. <hi>Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington,
Mr.</hi> Briuton, &amp;c that we at <hi>Plimouth</hi> had speciall eye to,
when wee commended them thither, abhorred their course, abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from their meetings, looked upon themselves as persons in great
danger, and bemoaned their condition to divers their friends, being
now overwhelmed with cares and feares what would bee the issue
of things. And note that now also Mr. <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi> that before
had suffered so much by authority for his evill doing, and was
come to deny it and preach against it, being now by these Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
called to place, accepts it, and became a Magistrate amongst
them, &amp;c. But whereas hee intimates, as if Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> had onely
done his message (according to his instructions) in a private way
from house to house, therein hee wrongs him: for hee did it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
in the place of their Assembly, who were so daunted at it as
they brake up, and did no act intended for that day, as hee rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it: but some would have had him imprisoned, others punished,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100163:45"/>
others sent to the Dutch and so for England. Yea Mr. <hi>Gorton</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
told Mr. <hi>Brownes</hi> sonne that his father had done that which he
deserved to die for, and were hee in any other place it would cost
him his life. So fit for Government were these men, as to judge a
peaceable claime of right without any further disturbance or stirre
made should thus deserve, Neither indeed have wee further stirred
then as before, ever resolving to rest in the determination of the
right honourable the Governour in chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Assistants of that Committee bee trusted with the affaires
of the Forraigne English Plantations, assuring our selves what ever
might proceed either from misinformation or want of due know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
what was formerly done, would bee rectified upon the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
and complaint made: Such were our thoughts of
them, and the justice wee expected, and still hope to receive from
them. And thus much for answer to that complaint.</p>

first Thursday in <hi>Septemb.</hi> sent for both the <hi>Nanohiggansets</hi> and
<hi>vncus,</hi> who appeared, and a league agreed on: but the <hi>Nanohig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gansets</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:100163:45"/>
broke againe, and warred upon <hi>vncus</hi> needlesly. The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Colonies admonished them againe and againe: and after no
admonition nor perswasions would serve, wee were then forced
to call the Commissioners together at an extraordinary season on
purpose, who finding it meet to take up Armes in the behalfe of
<hi>vncus</hi> our Confederate, whom by the agreement of the <hi>Nanohig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gansets</hi>
sundry times, at divers meetings wee were bound, and
it was made lawfull to doe. Hereupon the Commissioners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
as before, sent out their Warrants to their severall
and speciall Governments, and accordingly Forces were raised
at a dayes warning. But before this, in stead of hearkening
to righteous Counsell, they threatened also the English, saying,
they would make heapes of our dead bodies and cattle, as high
as their houses, burne our habitations, make spoile of our
goods, and used our Messengers very discurteously, &amp;c. And
for Captaine <hi>Standish,</hi> this I heard him relate, that being at
the place of <hi>Rendezvouze,</hi> before the <hi>Massachusets</hi> Forces came,
observing that some of the Inhabitants of <hi>Providence</hi> received
the <hi>Indians</hi> into their houses familiarly, who had put themselves
also into a posture of Armes, and the place within a mile of <hi>Secunck</hi>
or <hi>Rhehoboth</hi> where Captaine <hi>Standish</hi> lay; hee sent to <hi>Providence,</hi>
and required them to lay aside their neutrality, and either declare
themselves on the one side or other: For the warre being once
begun, hee would not beare with their carriage in entertaining, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,
and relieving the common enemy, but would disarm them,
&amp;c. And whether necessity put him not upon this course, or no, let
the Reader judge.</p>
            <p>And for the five hundred pound, 'tis true their hearts fayled to
see <hi>Plymouth</hi> Forces appeare, and <hi>Massachus.</hi> both Horse and Foot
upon their march on the one side their Countrey, under Mr. <hi>Edw.

and <hi>Pumham</hi> and <hi>Secononoco</hi> with reference to <hi>Massachusets</hi> with all
their men, attending the English word of command. And on the
other side their Countrey the forces of <hi>Cone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Commissioners to fall on. Now I say they were daun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed especially
because it came so suddenly upon them, wanting Mr. <hi>Gorton</hi> and his
friends who were not yet come; Hereupon they resolved to go to the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100163:46"/>
Commissioners to <hi>Massachus</hi> and compound, and did signe new
Articles to observe the peace not onely with the United Colonies
but with <hi>Vncus, Woosamequin, Pumham,</hi> and <hi>Socononoco,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our Confederates, including all the English in the land, to
make satisfaction for wrongs to <hi>Vncus,</hi> and to pay five hundred
pounds to the united Colonies, for the charge they put us to, which
indeed would not neare make it good, if they had paid it; but as
at other times, so now, not with standing their Hostages, they abused
us grosly, first sending <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> secondly, breaking all other
their Covenants, and came at last to a resolution, they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
give the money (which is a Beade, as current as coin in all that
part of <hi>America,</hi> of their owne making) to the <hi>Mowhakes</hi> at once, to
cut us off, then to pay it according to Covenant.</p>
            <p>And thus contrary to my resolution, I see a necessity of more
large answers then I intended; and indeed other wife I should speak
riddles, and not satisfie the Reader. Although were it an History,
I have many remarkable passages which here for brevity sake I must
omit. And if any think wee doe needlesly ingage in the troubles
betweene the <hi>Indians?</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, Let them know if wee should not here
and there keepe correspondency with some of them, they would
soone joyne all together against us. 2. The quarrall betweene
<hi>Vncus</hi> and <hi>Nanohigganset,</hi> arose upon his cleaving to us: For the
great <hi>Sachim Myantonimo</hi> would have marryed <hi>Vncus</hi> daughter, and
since <hi>Pessachus</hi> that succeeded him would have marryed <hi>Woosamequins</hi>
daughter, and all in policy to take them off from us; so that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
wee are necessitated to it. And 3. we are not out of hope in
time to bring them to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by a small Treat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se of that kinde. But this one thing I desire
the Reader to take notice of, that when that great Prince <hi>Myanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo</hi>
hee so much admires, had offered violence to <hi>Woosamequin</hi> (who
was under the protection of <hi>Plymouth</hi>) and missing his person, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
onely with the plunder of his goods: Upon <hi>Woosamequins</hi>
complaint to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> that Government alone, it being before the
Union, sent Captain <hi>Standish</hi> with a few men, not above 20. who
sent a message over the Bay of Salt water which parts <hi>Woosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mequin</hi> from them, <hi>Either to make restitution of his goods so injuriously
taken, or else to expect him to fetch them with a vengeance to their co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they sent over every particular that could bee demanded, even
to a woodden dish, and salved up all againe; but this was before
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100163:46"/>
any malignant English sate down so neare them, and held counsell
with them, before they had violated our persons to them, reported
us to bee base and low, out of favour with the King and State, &amp;c.
things very unworthy, abominable to be named, but that in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the abused Governments of the Country, I am forced to dang
such strokes at these proud and turbulent enemies of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>Next in <hi>pag.</hi> 94. that hee relateth of Mr. <hi>Williams; viz,</hi> the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
taking him with them that were sent to the <hi>Nanohiggansets,</hi>
in that troublesome time, <hi>viz. being one cast out of the Church (Mr. Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
should preach) <hi>It was all one to take counsell of a witch, and that
those that did it were worthy to die.</hi> Upon which Mr. <hi>Wilbour</hi> one of
the messengers <hi>was ready to die,</hi> saith hee, <hi>for feare hee should have been
hanged.</hi> This I cannot beleeve for these two Reasons: 1. Because
all men that know Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> know his moderation, wisdome and
piety to bee such, as such an expression was not like to drop from
him. 2. The strictest Government in <hi>New-Engl.</hi> that I know, takes
no advantage in the law at a mans person for being excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
insomuch as if he have an office, he holds it neverthelesse, and
this, I know practised, and therefore his relation unlike. But that
the Messengers were directed to another for their interpreter I know,
and that some took offence at their<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> practise I know also, but upon
different grounds, which I forbeare to mention, being now to
answer Mr. <hi>Gorton,</hi> and not Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 93. which is the last <hi>page</hi> in his Booke that I shall need to
make answer to, and the thing hee there brings against us is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to a doctrine one of their wives should heare delivered at <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sachusets</hi>

                  </gap> That the Ministery of the Apostles was and should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movel,
&amp;c.</hi> which I desire the Reader to turne to; but bee assured
through Gods mercy, by meanes of the late Bishop of <hi>Canterburies</hi>
persecutions of the godly here, wee are so excellently furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with shining Lights of the Gospel, as no such blasphemous
trash as this could bee there delivered, and so many able hearers,
as if it should have been delivered by any, the Lord with-drawing
his presence from him, it would have been forthwith excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
and published to the world. But I am confident if such a
thing were there heard, it was either from one of their owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100163:47"/>
or disciples made by them. And therefore I will passe by
the answer also, as not concerning any difference between him and
us, and so the rest of his writings to that end, and could wish that
<hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rcissus-like</hi> hee were not so much in love with his owne shadow,
lest it prove his ruine; there needing no other matter against him
then his owne words and writings to render him odious to the
State here, as well as to <hi>New-England</hi> from whence he came.</p>
            <p>AND now that I have finished what I conceive necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Mr. <hi>Gortons</hi> scandalous and slanderous Bookes, let me
briefly answer some objections that I often meet withall against the
Country of <hi>New-England.</hi> The first that I meet with is, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the rise and foundation of our <hi>New-England</hi> Plantations; It
being alledged (though upon a great mistake by a late Writer) that
division or disagreement in the Church of <hi>Leyden,</hi> was the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nay cause of the first Plantation in <hi>New-England;</hi> for saith the
Author, or to this effect, when they could no longer agree together,
the one part went to <hi>New-England,</hi> and began the Plantation at
<hi>Plymouth,</hi> which he makes the mother, as it were, of the rest of the
Churches, as if the foundation of our <hi>New-England</hi> Plantations
had been laid upon division or separation, then which nothing is
more untrue: For I perswade my selfe, never people upon earth
lived more lovingly together, and parted more sweetly then wee
the Church at <hi>Leyden</hi> did, not rashly in a distracted humour, but
upon joynt and serious deliberation, often seeking the minde of
God by fasti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g and prayer, whose gracious presence we not onely
found with us, but his blessing upon us from that time to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
to the indignation of our adversaries, the admiration of
strangers, and the exceeding consolation of our selves, to see such
effects of our prayers and teares before our pilgrimage here bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
And therefore briefly take notice of the true cause of it.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that that poor persecuted flock of Christ, by the malice
and power of the late Hiera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>chy were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yden</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi>
there to beare witnesse in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to the Kingly Office of
Christ Jesus in his Church: and there lived together ten yeares
under the United States, with much peace and liberty: But our
Reverend Pastor Mr. <hi>Iohn Robinson</hi> of late memory, and our grave
Elder <hi>Mr. William Brewster,</hi> (now both at rest with the Lord) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100163:47"/>
sidering amongst many other inconveniences, how hard the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
was where we lived, how many spent their estate in it, and were
forced to return for <hi>England;</hi> how grievous to live from under the
protection of the State of <hi>England;</hi> how like wee were to lose our
language, and our name of English; how little good wee did, or
were like to do to the Dutch in reforming the Sabbath; how una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
there to give such education to our children, as wee our selves
had received, &amp;c. They, I say, our of their Christian care of the
flock of Christ committed to them conceived, if Godwould bee
pleased to discover some place unto us (though in <hi>America)</hi> and
give us so much favour with the King and State of <hi>England,</hi> as to
have their protection there, where wee might enjoy the like liberty,
and where the Lord favouring our endeavours by his blessing, wee
might exemplarily shew our tender Country-men by our example
(no lesse burthened then our selves) where they might live, and
comfortably sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>iet and enjoy the like liberties with us, being
freed from Antichristian bondage, keep their names and Nation,
and not onely bee a meanes to enlarge the Dominions of our State,
but the Church of Christ also, if the Lord have a people amongst
the Natives whither hee should bring us, &amp;c. Hereby in their
grave Wisdomes they thought wee might more glorifie God, doe
more good to our Countrey, better provide for our posterity, and
live to be more refreshed by our labours, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ever wee could doe in
<hi>Holland</hi> where we were.</p>
            <p>Now these their private thoughts upon mature deliberation
they imparted to the Brethren of the Congregation, which after
much private discussion came to publike agitation, till at the length
the Lord was solemnly sought in the Congregation by fasting and
prayer to direct us, who moving our hearts more and more to the
worke, wee sent some of good abilities over into <hi>England</hi> to see
what favour or acceptance such a thing might finde with the King.
These also found God going along with them, and got Sir <hi>Edwin
Sands</hi> a religious Gentleman then living, to stirre in it, who procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Sir <hi>Robert Nawnton</hi> then principall Secretary of State to King
<hi>Iames</hi> of famous memory, to move his Majesty by a private moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to give way to such a people (who could not so comfortably
live under the Government of another State) to enjoy their liberty
of Conscience under his gracious protection in <hi>America,</hi> where
they would endeavour the advancement of his Majesties Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100163:48"/>
and the enlargement of the Gospel by all due meanes. This
his Majesty said was a good and honest motion, and asking what
prosits might arise in the part wee intended (for our eye was upon
the most Northern parts of <hi>Virginia</hi>) 'twas answered, Fishing. To
which hee replyed with his ordinary asseveration, <hi>So God have my
Soule 'tis an honest Trade, 'twas the Aposties owne calling, &amp;c.</hi>
But afterwards he told Sir <hi>Robert Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ton,</hi> (who took all occasions
to further it) that we should confer with the Bishops of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
and <hi>London, &amp;c.</hi> Whereupon wee were advised to persist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his first approbation, and not to entangle our selves with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which caused our Agents to repair to the <hi>Virginia</hi> Company, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o
in their Court demanded our ends of going; which being
related, they said the thing was of God, and granted a large
Patent, and one of them lent us 300 <hi>l. gratis</hi> for three yeares, which
was repaid.</p>
            <p>Our Agents returning, wee further sought the Lord by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
and solemn Fast, for his gracious guidance. And hereupon
wee came to this resolution, that it was best for one part of the
Church to goe at first, and the other to slay, <hi>viz.</hi> the youngest and
strongest part to goe. Secondly, they that went should freely offer
themselves. Thirdly, if the major part went, the Pastor to goe with
them; if not, the Elder onely. Fourthly, if the Lord should
srowne upon our proceedings, then those that went to returne, and
the Brethren that remained still there, to assist and bee helpfull to
them, but if God should bee pleased to favour them that went, then
they also should endeavour to helpe over such as were poore and
ancient, and willing to come; these things being agreed, the major
part stayed, and the Pastor with them for the present, but all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
(except a very few, who had rather wee would have stayed)
to follow after. The minor part, with Mr. <hi>Brews<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er</hi> their Elder,
resolved to enter upon this great work (but take notice the difference
of number was not great;) And when the Ship was ready to carry us
away, the Brethren that stayed having againe solemnly sought the
Lord with us, and for us, and we further engaging our selves mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
as before; they, I say, that stayed at <hi>Leyden</hi> feasted us that were
to goe at our Pastors house being large, where wee refreshed our
selves after our teares, with singing of Psalmes, making joyfull
melody in our hearts, as well as with the voice, there being many
of the Congregation very expert in Musick; and indeed it was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100163:48"/>
the sweetest melody that ever mine eares heard. After this they
accompanyed us to <hi>Delphs Haven,</hi> where wee were to imbarque,
and there feasted us againe; and after prayer performed by our
Pastor, where a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ood of teares was poured out, they accompanyed
us to the Ship, but were not able to speake one to another for the
abundance of sorrow to part: but wee onely going aboard (the Ship
lying to the Key) and ready to set sayle, the winde being faire) wee
gave them a v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lley of small shot, and three peeces of Ordinance,
and so lifting up our hands to each other, and our hearts for each
other to the Lord our God, we departed, and found his presence
with us in the midst of our manifold straits hee carryed us tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
And if any doubt this relation, the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as I heare, at
<hi>Delphs</hi> Haven preserve the memory of it to this day, and will inform
them.</p>
            <p>But falling with <hi>Cape Cod</hi> which is in <hi>New-England,</hi> and
standing to the Southward for the place wee intended, wee met
with many dangers, and the Mariners put back into the Harbou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the <hi>Cape,</hi> which was the 11. of <hi>November,</hi> 1620, where
considering Winter was come, the Seas dangerous, the season
cold, the winds high, and being well furnished for a Plantation, we
entered upon discovery, and setled at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where God being
pleased to preserve and enable us, wee that went, were at a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

and in providing there for them till they could reape a crop of their

               </gap> the <hi>Dutch</hi> offered us, either to have removed into <hi>Zealand,</hi>
and there lived with them: or if we would go on such adventures, to
goe under them to <hi>Hudsons</hi> River (where they have since a great
plantation, &amp;c.) and how they would freely have transported us,
and furnished every family with cattle, &amp;c. Also the English Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
that joyned with us in this expedition, whom wee since
bought out, which is fitter for an History, then an answer to
such an Objection, (&amp; I trust will be accomplished in good time.) By
all which the Reader may see there was no breach between us that
went, and the brethren that stayed, but such love as indeed is seldome
found on earth.</p>

shew them whereupon our practice was grounded; and if they
found upon due search it was built upon the Word, they should be
willing to take up what was of God. We accordingly shewed them
the Primitive practice for our warrant, taken out of the Acts of the
Apostles, and the Epistles written to the severall Churches by the
said Apostles together with the Commandements of Christ the
Lord in the Gospell, and other our warrants for every particular
wee did from the booke of God. Which being by them well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and considered, they also entred into Covenant with God and
one with another to walke in all his wayes revealed, or as they
should bee made knowne unto them, and to worship him according
to his will revealed in his written word onely, &amp;c. So that here
also thou maist see they set not the Church at <hi>Plimouth</hi> before them
for example, but the Primitive Churches were and are their and our

            <p>Having thus briefly shewed that the foundation of our <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>

as is seldome found on earth: And having shewed also that the

to judge the harder of <hi>New-England,</hi> and the Churches there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(say they) <hi>The Church of Plymouth which went first from Leyden,

counsell he gave that part of the Church which went for <hi>New-England</hi>
at their departure and afterward, might easily resolve the
doubt, and take off the aspersion.</p>
            <p>For his Doctrine, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> living three yeares under his Ministery, before
we began the worke of Plantation in <hi>New-England;</hi> It was alwayes
against separation from any the Churches of Christ, professing and
holding communion both with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches, yea,
tendering it to the <hi>Scots</hi> also, as I shall make appeare more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly anon.
Ever holding forth how wary persons ought to bee
in separating from a Church, and that till Christ the Lord departed
wholly from it, man ought not to leave it, onely to beare witnesse
against the corruption that was in it. But if any object, he separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and wrote largely against it; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
hee wrote largely against it, but yet let me tell you, hee
allowed hearing the godly Ministers preach and pray in the publick
Assamblies; yea, hee allowed private communion not onely with
them, but all that were faithfull in <hi>Christ</hi> Jesus in the Kingdome
and else where upon all occasions; yea, honored them for the power
of godlinesse above all other the professors of Religion in the
world, nay, I may truly say, his spirit cleaved unto them, being so
well acquainted with the integrity of their hearts, and care to walke
blamelesse in their lives, which was no small motive to him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us to remove from <hi>Holland,</hi> where wee might probably not
onely continue <hi>English,</hi> but have and maintain such sweet communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the godly of that Nation, as through Gods great mercy we
enjoy this day.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, I confesse he was more rigid in his course and way at
first, then towards his latter end; for his study was peace and union
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100163:50"/>
so far as might agree with faith and a good conscience; and for schi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
and division, there was nothing in the world more hatefull to him:
But for the government of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it was in the
Episcopall way, the Liturgy and stinted prayers of the Church then;
yea, the constitution of it as Nationall, and so consequently the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt

to this day. And if the Lord would be pleased to stir up the hearts
of those, in whom (under him) the power of Reformation lies, to
reform that abuse, that a distinction might once be put between the
precious and the vile, particular Churches might be gathered by the
powerfull preaching of the Word, those onely admitted into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
whose hearts the Lord perswades to submit unto the Iron
rod of the Gospel; O how sweet then would the communion of the
Churches be! How thorow the Reformation! How easie would
the differences be reconciled between the Presbyterian and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

and good agreement smile upon this Nation! How would the subtle
underminers of it be disappointed, and the faithfull provoked to
sing songs of praise and thanksgiving! Nay, how would the God
of order be glorified in such orderly walking of the Saints! And

and in the praises of our God who hath been so good to his poore

out of all their troubles. But I have made too great a digression, and
must return.</p>
            <p>In the next place I should speak of Mr. <hi>Robinsons</hi> Apology, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he maketh a briefe defence against many adversaries, &amp;c. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is both in Latine and English, of small price, and easie to bee

for the differences between his congregation, and other the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches.</p>
            <p>The next thing I would have the Reader take notice of, is, that
however the church of <hi>Leyden</hi> differed in some particulars, yet made
no Schisme or separation from the Reformed Churches, but held
communion with them occasionally: For we ever placed a large<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100163:50"/>
between those that grounded their practise upon the Word of
God (tho differing from us in the exposition or understanding of it)
and those that hated such Reformers and Reformation, and went
on in Antichristian opposition to it, and persecution of it, as the late
Lord Bishops did, who would not in deed and truth (whatever their
pretences were) that Christ should rule over them. But as they often
stretched out their hands against the saints; so God hath withered
the Arm of their power, thrown them down from their high &amp; lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

that he might become an example to all those that rise against
God in his Sabbath, in the preaching of his Word, in his Saints, in
the purity of his Ordinances, And I heartily desire that others may
heare and feare withall.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> it was usuall for our Members that understood
the language, and lived in, or occasionally came over to <hi>London,</hi> to
communicate with them, as one <hi>Iohn Ienny</hi> a Brewer long did, his
wife and family, &amp;c. and without any offence to the Church: So
also for any that had occasion to travel into any other part of the
Netherlands they daily did the like: And our Pastor Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi> in
the time when Arminianisme prevailed so much, at the request of
the most Orthodox Divines, as <hi>Poliander, Festus, Homlius, &amp;c.</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
daily against <hi>Episcopius</hi> (in the Academy at <hi>Leyden</hi>) and others
the grand champions of that error<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had as good respect amongst
them, as any of their own Divines; Insomuch as when God took
him away from them and us by death, the University, and Ministers
of the City accompanied him to his grave with all their accustomed
solemnities; bewayling the great losse that not onely that particular
Church had, whereof he was Pastor; but some of the chief of them
sadly affirmed, that all the Churches of Christ sustained a losse by
the death of that worthy Instrument of the Gospel I could instance
also divers of their members that understood the English tongue, and
betook themselves to the communion of our Church, went with us
to <hi>New-England,</hi> as <hi>Godbert Godbertson, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, at this very instant,

<hi>Samuel Terry</hi> was received from the <hi>French</hi> Church there, into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with us; also the wife of <hi>Francis Cooke</hi> being a <hi>Walloone,</hi>
holds communion with the Church at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> as she came from
the <hi>French,</hi> to this day, be vertue of communion of Churches; There

to <hi>New-Plymouth,</hi> who comming to age of discerning, demanded
also communion with us, &amp; proving himself to be come of such pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
as were in ful communion with the <hi>French</hi> Churches, was here

the Church; and upon Letters of recommendation from the Church
at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> hee was also admitted into fellowship with the Church
at <hi>Duxburrow,</hi> being six miles distant from <hi>Plymouth;</hi> and so I dare
say, if his occasions lead him, may from Church to church through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>New-England.</hi> For the truth is, the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Churches
either of them being a people distinct from the world, and gathered
into an holy communion, and not Nationall Churches, nay, so far
from it, as I verily beleeve the sixth person is not of the Church, the
difference is so small (if moderately pondered, between them and
us) as we dare not for the world deny communion with them.</p>
            <p>And for the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> however wee have had least oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
offered to hold communion with them; yet thus much I can
and doe affirme, that a godly Divine comming over to <hi>Leyden</hi> in
<hi>Holland,</hi> where a Booke was printed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the nullity of <hi>Perth,</hi> Assembled, whom we judged to bee the Author
of it, and hidden in <hi>Holland</hi> for a season to avoid the rage of those

conversant with our Pastor Mr. <hi>Robinson,</hi> and using to come to hear
him on the Sabbath, after Sermon-ended, the Church being to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take

               </gap>and our participation in that Ordinance; To which our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor

you may not onely stay to behold us, but par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k with us, if you please, for
wee acknowledge the Churches of Scotland to be the Churches of Christ, &amp;c.</hi>
The Minister also replyed to this purpose, if not also in the same
words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That for his part hee could comfortable partake with the Church,
and willingly would, but that it is possible some of his brethren of Scotland
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100163:51"/>
might take offence at his act;</hi> which he desired to avoid in regard of the
opinion the English Churches which they held communion withall
had of us: However he rendered thanks to Mr. <hi>Robinson,</hi> and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in that respect to be onely a spectator of us. These things I was
earnestly requested to publish to the world by some of thè godly Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
party, who apprehend the world to bee ignorant of our
proceedings, conceiving in charity that if they had been knowne,
some late Writers and Preacher would never have written and spoke
of us as they did, and still doe as they have occasion: But what they
ignorantly judge, write, or speak of us, I trust the Lord in mercy wil
passe by.</p>
            <p>In the next place, for the wholsome counsell Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi> gav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
that part of the Church whereof he was pastor, at their departure
from him to begin the great worke of Plantation in <hi>New-England,</hi>
amongst other wholsome Instructions and Exhortations, hee used
these expressions, or to the same purpose; We are now ere long to
part asunder, and the Lord knoweth whether ever he should live to
see our faces again: but whether the Lord had appointed it or not, he
charged us before God and his blessed Angels, to follow him no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then he followed Christ, And if God should reveal any thing
to us by any other instrument of his, to be as ready to receive it, as
ever we were to receive any truth by his Ministery: For he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
confident the Lord had more truth and light yet to breake forth
out of his holy Word. He took occasion also miserably to bewaile
the state and condition of the Reformed Churches, who were come
to a period in Religion, and would goe no further then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of their Reformation: As for example, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> they
could not be drawne to goe beyond what <hi>Luther</hi> saw, for whatever
part of Gods will he had further imparted and revealed to <hi>Calvin,</hi>
they will rather die them embrace it. And so also, saith he, you see the
<hi>Calvinists,</hi> they stick where he left them: A misery much to bee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented;
For though they were precious shining lights in their
times, yet God had not revealed his whole will to them: And
were they now living, saith hee, they would bee as ready and
willing to embrace further light, as that they had received. Here
also he put us in mind of our Church-Covenant (at least that part of
it) whereby wee promise and covenant with God and one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to receive whatsoever light or truth shall be made known to us
from his written Word: but withall exhorted us to take heed what
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100163:52"/>
we received for truth, and well to examine and compare, and weigh
it with other Scriptures of truth, before we received it; For, saith
he, <hi>It is not possible the Christian world should come so l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tely cut of su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h
thick Antichristian darknesse, and that full perfection of knowledge should
breake forth at once.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing hee commended to us, was, that wee should use
all meanes to avoid and shake off the name of <hi>Brownist,</hi> being a meer
nick-name and brand to make Religion odious, and the professors
of it to the Christian world; and to that end, said hee, I should be
glad if some godly Minister would goe over with you, or come to
you, before my comming; For, said hee, there will bee no difference
between the unconformable Ministers and you, when they come
to the practise of the Ordinances out of the Kingdome: And so
advised us by all meanes to endeavour to close with the godly party
of the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and rather to study union then divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>viz.</hi> how neare we might possibly, without sin close with them,
then in the least measure to affect division or separation from them.
And be not loath to take another Pastor or Teacher, saith hee, for
that flock that hath two shepheards is not indangered, but secured
by it. Many other things there were of great and weighty conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
which he commended to us, but these things I thought good
to relate, at the request of some well-willers to the peace and good
agreement of the godly, (so distracted at present about the settling
of Church-government in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi>) that so both
sides may truly see what this poor despised Church of Christ now
at <hi>New-Plymouth in New-England,</hi> but formerly at <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi>
was and is; how far they were and still are from separation from
the Churches of <hi>Christ,</hi> especially those that are Reformed.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, we professe and desire to practise a separation from the
world, &amp; the works of the world, which are works of the flesh, such
as the Apostle speaketh of, <hi>Ephes. 5. 19, 20, 21. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11. and
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 11, 12. And as the Churches of Christ are all Saints by
calling, so wedesire to see the grace of God shining forth, (at least
seemingly, leaving secret things to God) in all we admit into church
fellowship with us, &amp; to keep off such as openly wallow in the mire
of their sins, that neither the holy things of God, nor the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Saints may be leavened or polluted thereby. And if any
joyning to us formerly, either when we lived at <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> or
since we came to <hi>New-England,</hi> have with the manifestation of their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100163:52"/>
faith and profession of holiness held forth therewith separation
from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I have divers times, both in the one
place, and the other, heard either <hi>Mr. Robinson</hi> our Pastor, or <hi>Mr.
Brewster</hi> our Elder stop them forthwith, shewing them that wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
no such things at their hands, but only to hold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orth faith
in Christ Jesus, holinesse in the feare of God, and submission to
every Ordinance and appointment of God, leaving the Church
of <hi>England</hi> to themselves, and to the Lord before whom they should
stand or fall, and to whom wee ought to pray to reforme what was
amisse amongst them. Now this Reformation we have lived to see
performed and brought about by the mighty power of God, this
day in a good measure, and I hope the Lord Jesus will perfect his
work of Reformation, till all be according to the good pleasure of
his will. By all which I desire the Reader to take notice of
our former and present practise notwithstanding all the injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and scandalous taunting reports are passed on us. And if
these things will not satisfie, but wee must still suffer reproach,
and others for our sakes, because they and wee thus walke,
our practise being for ought wee know, wholly grounded on
the written Word, without any addition or humane invention
knowne to us, taking our patterne from the Primitive Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as they were regulated by the blessed Apostles in their
owne dayes, who were taught and instructed by the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, and had the unerring and all-knowing Spirit of God
to bring to their remembrance the things they had heard: I say, if
wee must still suffer such reproach, notwithstanding our charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them who will notbe in charity with us; Gods will be done.</p>
            <p>The next aspersion cast upon us, is, that we will not suffer any that
differ from us never so little to reside or cohabite with us; no nor
the Presbyterian Government which differeth so little from
us. To which I answer, our practise witnesseth the contrary.
For 'tis well knowne that Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Noyce</hi> who are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Church at <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

farre as a single Congregation can bee exercised in it; yet never

or Primitive way. 'Tis knowne also that Mr. <hi>Hubbard</hi>
the Minister at <hi>Hengam</hi> hath declared himselfe for that way: nay
which is more then ever I heard of the other two, hee refuseth to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100163:53"/>
baptize no children that are tendred to him (although this liberty
stands not upon a Presbyterian bottome) and yet the Civill State
never molested him for it: onely comming to a Synod held in the
Country the last yeare, which the Magistrates called, requesting
the Churches to send their Elders and such other as might bee able
to hold forth the light of-God from his written word in case of
some doubts which did arise in the Country: I say hee comming
the last sitting of the Assembly which was adjourned to the eighth of
<hi>Iune</hi> next, was in all meeknesse and love requested to bee present and
hold forth his light hee went by in baptizing all that were brought
to him, hereby waving the practise of the Churches; which he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to take into consideration they rested in his answer. So also 'tis
wel known, that before these unhappy troubles arose in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> there were divers Gentlemen of <hi>Scotland</hi> that groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the heavy pressaries of those times, wrote to <hi>New-England</hi> to
know whether they might freely be suffered to exercise their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall
government amongst us. And it was answered affima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
they might: and they sending over a Gentleman to take
a view of some fit place; A River called <hi>Meromeck</hi> neare <hi>Ipswich</hi>
and <hi>Newberry</hi> aforesaid, was shewed their Agent, which he well liked,
and where wee have since four townes settled, and more may bee
for ought I know, so that there they might have had a compleate
Presbytery and whither they intended to have come: but meeting
with manifold crosses being halfe Seas thorow they gave over
their intendments, and as I have heard these were many of the
Gentlemen that first fell upon the late Covenant in <hi>Scotland:</hi>
by all which will easily appeare how wee are here wronged by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and the harder measure as wee heare imposed upon our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
for our sakes, nay pretending our example of their president.
And last of all, not long before I came away certaine discontented
persons in open Court of the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> demanding that liberty,
it was freely and as openly tendred to them; shewing their former
practices by mee mentioned: but willed not to expect that wee
should provide them Ministers &amp;c. for the same, but getting such
themselves they might exercise the Presbyterian Government at their
libertie, walking peaceably towards us as wee trusted we should doe
towards them. So that if our brethren here shall bee restrained they
walking peaceably, the example must not be taken from us, but arise
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> some other principle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:100163:53"/>
But it will not bee objected though you deale thus with the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
way, yet you have a severe law against Ana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aptists, yea one
was whipt at <hi>Massachusets</hi> for his Religion? and your law banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them? <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>Massachusets</hi> Governement have
such a law as to banish, but not to whip in that kinde. And certaine
men desiring some mitigation of it; It was answered in my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
'Tis true, we have a severe law, but wee never did or will exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the rigour of it upon any, and have men living amongst us, nay
some in our Churches of that judgement, and as long as they carry
themselves peaceably as hitherto they doe, wee will leave them to
God, our selves having performed the duty of brethren to them. And
whereas there was one whipt amongst us; 'tis true wee knew his
judgement what it was: but had hee not carried himselfe so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously
towards the Authority God hath betrusted us with in
an high exemplary measure, wee had never so censured him: and
therefore he may thank himself who suffered as an evill doer in that
respect. But the reason wherefore wee are loath either to repeale
or alter the law, is, Because wee would have it remaine in force to
beare witnesse against their judgement and practice which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them to bee erroneous.</p>
            <p>And yet neverthelesse said the Governour to those preferred the
request, you may tel our friends in <hi>England,</hi> whither yee are some of
you going, since the motion proceedeth from such as wee know
move it in love to us, wee will seriously take it into consideration at
our next Generall Court. So that thou maist perceive good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the worst is spoken of things in that kinde.</p>
            <p>Furthermore in the Government of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> to our great griefe,
not onely the Pastor of a Congregation waveth the administration
of baptisme to Infants, but divers of his Congregation are fallen
with him, and yet all the meanes the civill power hath taken against
him and them, is to stirre up our Elders to give meeting and see if
by godly conference they may bee able to convince and reclaime
him, as in mercy once before they had done by Gods blessing upon
their labours. Onely at the foresaid Synod, two were ordered to
write to him in the name of the Assembly, and to request his presence
at their next meeting aforesaid to hold forth his light hee goeth by
in waving the practise of the Churches; with promise if it be light,
to walke by it: but if it appeare otherwise, then they trust hee will
returne againe to the unity of practice with them. And for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100163:54"/>
two Governments of <hi>Coneetacut</hi> and <hi>Newhaven,</hi> if either have
any law in force against them, or so much as need of a law in that
kinde, 'tis more then I have heard on.</p>
            <p>For our parts (I mean the Churches of <hi>New-Engl.</hi>) we are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
through Gods mercy, the way of God in which we walke, and
according to which wee perform our Worship and service to Him,
concurreth with those Rules our blessed Saviour hath left upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
by the Evangelists and Apostles, and is agreeable with the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of those Primitive Churches mentioned in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by the same Apostles, as appeareth not onely in that Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
Histiory, but in their Epistles to the severall Churches there
mentioned; yet neverthelesse if any thorow tendernesse of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
be otherwise minded, to such wee never turn a dease eate, nor
become rigorous, though we have the streame of Authority on our
sides. Nay, if in the use of all means we cannot reclaim them, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>wisdome that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easie
to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without
hypocrisie, and the fruit of righteousness is sonne in peace, of them that make
peace,</hi> according to <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 17, 18. And if any differing from us bee
answerable to this Rule in their lives and conversations, we do not
exercise the Civill sword against them. But for such as <hi>Gorton</hi> and
his company, whose wisdome seems not to be from above, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in that it is <hi>full of envyings, strife, confusion, am.</hi> 3. 15, 16. being
therein such as the Apostle <hi>Iude</hi> speaks on, <hi>v.</hi> 8. viz. <hi>earthly, sensuall,
devillish,</hi> who <hi>v. 16. despise dominion, and speak evill of dignities.</hi> These
<hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. are <hi>murmurers, complayners, walkers alter their own lusts, and
their mouth speaketh great swelling words,</hi> being <hi>clouds without water, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
about of winds, trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead,
plucked up by the roots, raging waves of the sea, foaming out their owne
shame, wandring starres, to whom</hi> (without repentance, which I much
desire to see, or hear of in him, if it may stand with the will of God)
<hi>is reserved the blacknesse of darknesse for ever.</hi> These I say are to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
with by another rule, and not to bee borne: who suffer as evil
dores, and area shame to Religion which they professe in word, but
deny in their lives and conversations. These every tender conscience
abhors, and will justifie and assist the <hi>higher Powers God hath ordained,</hi>
against such carnall Gospellers, <hi>who heare not the sword in vaine, Rom.</hi>
13. but execute Gods vengeance on such: for the Civill Magistrate is
<hi>the Minister of God, a Revenger to execute wrath on him that doth evil.</hi> And
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100163:54"/>
therefore a broad difference is to be put between such evill doers, and
those tender consciences who follow the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight of Gods Word in
their owne perswassions, (though judged erroneous by the places
where they live) so long as their waliking is answerable to the rules
of the Gospel, by preserving peace, and holding forth holinesse in
their conversations amongst men.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought good to signifie, because we of <hi>New-England</hi>
are said to be so often propounded for an example. And if any will
take us for a president, I desire they may really know what wee doe,
rather then what others ignorantly or malitiously report of us,
assuring my self that none will ever be losers by following us so far
as we follow Christ: Which that we may doe, and our posterities
after us the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, &amp; our Father, accept in
Christ what is according to him, discover, pardon, and reform what
is amisie amongst us; and guide us and them by the assistance of the
holy Ghost for time to time, till time shal be no more; that the Lord
our God may still delight to dwell amongst his Plantations and
Churches there by his gracious presence, and may goe on blessing
to blesse them with heavenly blessings in these earthly places, that
so by his blessing they may not onely grow up to a Nation, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
exemplary for good unto others. And let all that wish wel to
<hi>Sion say Amen.</hi>
