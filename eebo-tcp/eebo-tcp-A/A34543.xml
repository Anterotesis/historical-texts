            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Second
DISCOURSE
OF THE
RELIGION of ENGLAND.</head>
            <head>SECT. I.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Of the Foundation of our Peace already laid in the Religion of
the Nation, and the Structure thereof, to be perfected by the
Vnity of that Profession.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>COncerning Religion in this Kingdom, there have
been, and still are great thoughts of heart, and the
troubled state thereof hath much disturbed the
Minds of Men, and the whole course of Human
Affairs. Doubtless, Religion it self is not in fault, which
in its right and sound state, being an Institution holy, just
and good, must needs be of great efficacy to compose and
quiet our minds, and to heal and settle the Nations. But that
which in it self is Excellent, is by the Errors and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men, made subject to much vanity. And the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53300:3"/>
of Mankind being not able to raze out the deep impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
thereof that are in our Nature, hath made it his Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
so to corrupt or discompose it, as to disorder the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Men, and the Affairs of the World about it.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Cure of these Distempers, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
of the Evils thence arising, there is no cause of Despair
or Despondency, if Men cease from their high Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and God from his righteous Indignation. The most
effectual means of Reconciliation between the Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Parties, is, For all of them to be reconciled to God.
Then would that Spirit of Perversness, which by the Divine
Displeasure hath been mingled in the midst of us, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troled
and vanquished; and Offences and Prejudices being
removed, we might discern the Way of Peace. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
that Sentence should pass upon this Generation, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and misery is in their paths, and the way of peace they
have not known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, under the Divine Favour and Blessing, our Help
standeth in the Wisdom and Piety of our SOVEREIGN
and His PARLIAMENT. But this Grand Affair is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be full of difficulties, caused by the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Prejudices and Interests of the several Parties. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
the Prudence and Patience of those that sit at
the Helm of Government, is able to Master it: For, the
Ground-work of Peace is laid to their hands, in the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Nation; and the Impartial may descry the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of such a Settlement as may accommodate all those
Parties in which the Nation's Peace is bound up.</p>
            <p>The true Interest of Soveraignty, is the self-same with
that of the Universality, or whole Body of the Kingdom;
and this is founded in such a Common-Good, as belongs to
all sorts of men, by whom the Publike Weal consists. And
where there are, and inevitably will be different Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
among them, the Wisdom of the Government is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53300:3"/>
and lessen their differences, as much as it is possible;
but, howsoever, to prevent or heal divisions, and to hold
them united among themselves, in the common Benefit, and
all of them necessarily dependant upon the State. This is a
firm Basis of the perpetual stability of Empire, as also of
the Subjects Tranquility and Prosperity; and the present
Discourse rests upon this Principle as its sure Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now in this Realm, the joint Stock of those several Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
for matter of Religion, is <hi>REFORMED CHRISTIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITY,</hi>
for which they are all jealous, even unto discompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
upon any Encroachments of the Popish Party. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it is the Wisdom of this Government, to remove or
lessen the Differences, and to cure the Divisions which
now disturb and divide the Protestants, and to hold them
united among themselves, and all of them in firm depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
upon this State, and consequently, to give them all
their due encouragement, not indeed in loose and irregular
wayes, but in a ruled Order, consistent with stable Polity,
and agreeable to the Government of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Ground-work being already laid in the Protestant
Religion, which is the general and grand Interest of this
Nation, the Structure and Fabrick of the Unity and Peace
of this Realm, is more or less perfected, as the Unity of this
Profession, and the Peace and Concord of its Professors, is
more or less acquired. And now this great Question lyes
before us, <hi>Whether the Vnity of Religion be obtained by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
a Conformity of Judgment and Practice in matters of
perpetual difference from the beginning of the Reformation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this very day; or, by permitting a latitude of Opinion and
Practice in those points; and that not infinite and inordinate,
but limited by the Publike Rule.</hi>

            <head>SECT. II.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The Good of the several Parties is best secured by common
Equity, and the good of the Vniversality.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HOw happy might the disposition of Human Affairs be,
if that were acknowledged in mens Practice, which
is most clear and obvious to Human Understanding, <hi>That
things of common Equity and regard to all sorts, who are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
included in the Publike State, be preferred by each
particular Party, before great Advantages to themselves apart,
with disregard of all others.</hi> For, all particular Interests
which are uncorrupt, and will hold firm, are imbarked in
the Interest of the Universality, and must sink or swim
therewith: Whereupon, not onely the Commonwealth,
but the more appropriate Concernments of men, are better
secured for continuance, by this Moderation and common
Equity.</p>
            <p>There lye before us the Protestant Religion, (which is
the true Primitive Christianity) and the Ancient, Equal
and Happy Constitution of the Government of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
The Conservation and Advancement of both These,
are infinitely more valuable than the prevalence of Parties,
by all true Protestants, and true <hi>English</hi> men. A publike
Spirit is that which is truly pious and generous. But, over
and above this Noble and Christian Consideration, this also
should be very prevalent, That those Two great things
before named, in which all do share, and by which all
subsist, are the Basis even of the more private and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Benefits of the several Parties; and by disturbing these,
they weaken their own hold, and disturb their own safety.
Those that hate Moderation, and follow Extremes on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand, consider not the true state of <hi>England.</hi> It is an
unhappy Error when divided Parties, who when all is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53300:4"/>
done, in their divided state, can be but Parties, and not
the Whole, shall so act in their turns, as if they took
themselves to be the whole Body of the Nation, or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
thereunto. And it is a calamitous aversness, when
such as must live together either as Friends or Enemies,
shall refuse lawful and safe terms of mutual agreement.</p>
            <p>As for Conscience, and its high Concernments, if it
be guided by that <hi>Wisdom which is from above, which is
first pure, then peaceable,</hi> it puts in no caution against the
healing of this breach: For, Order and Peace may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
upon terms not repugnant to the Principles of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Party. His Majesty's Wisdom hath rightly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
this matter, in His Declaration concerning Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Affairs, where He saith, <q>
                  <hi>We are the rather indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to take this upon Vs,</hi> (that is, to give some deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to the matters in difference) <hi>by finding upon a
full Conference that we have had with the Learned men of
several Perswasions, That the Mischiefs under which both
Church and State do at present suffer, do not result from
any formed Doctrine or Conclusion which either Party
maintains or avows; but from the Passion, Appetite, and
Interest of particular persons, which contract greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to each other by those Affections, than would natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
arise from their Opinions.</hi>
               </q> It is apparent, that the
avowed Doctrines on either side, could not set the Parties
at this distance, if their Spirits and Interests were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="3" type="section">
            <head>SECT. III.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>What may be esteemed a good Constitution of the State Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>AS concerning the publike Order, it imports exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
to discern and make a difference between
things desirable, but morally impossible, or extreamly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53300:5"/>
improbable, and things necessary and attainable. Perfect
unanimity about matters of Religion, and a harmony of
Opinion in all Theological Truths, is very desirable; but
it was never yet found in any Age of the World, among
those that owned the same Religion, and consequently it
cannot be necessary in all those that ought to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in the same Church, or Religious Communion.
For which cause, a precise Uniformity in matters of meer
Opinion, will hardly ever pass with general satisfaction:
Neither is it of that importance, that some make it to be,
for Peace and Edification. There is another thing not
onely desirable, but the indispensable duty of all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
persons, which is Brotherly Love among all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>the common Faith once given to the Saints.</hi> This is of
far greater consequence than the former, and more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attainable, because it is a Catholick Disposition, and
the right Spirit of true Christianity; and indeed, the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hereof is lamentable and reproachful. Howbeit, this
excellent Christian Vertue is commonly much interrupted
and impaired in many, by prejudicate Opinions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
Affections; and it must not be expected, but that
Animosities and Jealousies may remain between men of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Perswasions, by reason of the corruption of man's
nature, and the infirmities of the best of men. Aud there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the foundation of a solid National Settlement, must
not, and need not be laid in mens good dispositions and
inclinations: For, although the distemper of many minds
continue, yet publike Order, and steddy Government, is
in no wise impossible.</p>
            <p>Things are necessary, either as the End, or the Means.
The things here considered, that are necessary as the End,
are, The Advancement of the Protestant Religion, and
the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> the Tranquility of Church and
State, and the Security of all sound Protestants, and good
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53300:5"/>
Subjects. That which is necessary as the Means, is the
Publike Rule and Standard by which these blessed Ends
may be obtained; that, notwithstanding the remainder
of mens Perversness, the common high Concerns of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion, and of this Kingdom, be not disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
impaired, or cast back by the Altercations that may
chance to arise between men of different private Opinions,
and different partial Interests. The high Importance and
Necessity of a stated Rule of such Force and Efficacy,
evinceth the possibility thereof: For, so Noble and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Ends, cannot be destitute of all possible Means
leading thereunto. Evil Dispositions and Manners are the
rise of Good Laws: And Law-makers, that are subject
to like passions with other men, have the Wisdom to limit
themselves and others, for the Universal Good, wherein
the good of every Individual is secured.</p>
            <p>The Publike Rule being to be framed to the proportion
of the People that are to be setled under it, the chief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
must be had to their fixed and unmovable Perswasions
and Inclinations, lest They should break the Rule, or the
Rule break them. In a Nation whose Active Part is zealous
of Religion, and able to discern, and addicted to discourse
the Grounds thereof, the Order of Things ought, in the
first place, to be directed to the satisfying of the Just and
Reasonable Demands of Conscience, which being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
is a restless thing; and then to the outward Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
of Piety and Learning, and withall, to the brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Ambition, Avarice, Faction, and all depraved
Appetite. It must be expected, That divers Obliquities
and Deficiencies may remain, and Troubles will arise: but if
that which is Wholesom and Good, be so predominant as to
Master the Evils, though not to extinguish them, it is to be
esteemed a Good Constitution.</p>

            <p>THere was lately published a Discourse for a due Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in Religion, by Comprehension, Toleration and
Connivence, directed to this End, That the occasions of
those Discords which divide the Members, and distract the
whole Body of the Protestant Profession, might cease; and
that the common Concernments, wherein the disagreeing
Parties have a large joint Stock in things of greatest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
might be pursued. This is encountred with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Discourse, which is here to be examined, and the
state and reason of the aforesaid Latitude, is to be further
cleared.</p>
            <p>Toleration being commonly understood of the permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of different ways of Religion, without the Line of
the Approved Way, <hi>A Discourse of Toleration</hi> doth not
hit <hi>the Discourse of the Religion of England,</hi> in the main
thereof, whose chief Design is the Extension of the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Order, and the Moderation therein required; and
then Toleration is treated of analogically, with respect not
only to common Charity, but to the Safety of the setled
Polity. It is no less besides the mark, to argue from the
Mischiefs of a boundless and licentious Toleration, against
that which is Limited and well Managed, and hath for the
Subject thereof, nothing that is intolerable.</p>
            <p>But, if under this Name be comprehended also the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of diversity of Opinion in the same Established
Order, let it be considered, Whether any ample Polity
can consist without such Permission. For, it is a thing ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unknown, and seems morally impossible, for any
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53300:6"/>
numerous Society of Inquiring men, to be of the same
judgment in all points of Religion. And though the <hi>Sons
of the Church,</hi> as they are called, agree in those points
wherein they all differ from the <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> yet they
differ among themselves in far weightier Matters, and such
as have caused great Schisms, and have been the subjects of
the Debates and Determinations of some Synods in the
Reformed Churches. Now if Charity among themselves,
and their appropriate Interest, dispose them to this mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
forbearance, a more extensive Charity, and the common
Interest of Reformed Christianity, should incline them to
a forbearance in those other matters.</p>
            <p>There is yet a greater Error committed about <hi>the Subject
of Toleration,</hi> which the <hi>Answerer,</hi> by mistake, will have
to be <hi>Dissentions in Religion,</hi> but is nothing so in the design
of that Discourse to which he pretends an Answer. And
this hath brought forth a large Impertinency, which takes
up more than a third part of his Book: For, those whose
Liberty He seeks to withstand, are not touched with that
which he writes at large of the nature of Dissentions, with
their Causes and Consequences, and the Magistrates duty
concerning them, whether it be right or wrong, setting
aside the injurious application thereof. And all that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
had been spared, if he had put a difference between
<hi>Dissention</hi> and <hi>Dissent,</hi> words that are near in sound, and
perhaps, sometimes, promiscuously used; but in their strict
and proper sense, far distant: For, <hi>Dissention</hi> is no sooner
presented to the mind, but it is apprehended as something
either culpable and offensive, or calamitous and unhappy:
But <hi>Dissent</hi> is of a better notion, and is not necessarily on
both sides, either a Fault or a Grievance. But if this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
means by Dissentions, no more then dissents or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of Opinion, with what truth and justice can he
charge them all (as he doth) with such execrable Causes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53300:7"/>
and Effects. Dissentions have been, and may be remedied,
and their fuel being taken away, those flames will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished:
But diversity of Opinion seems in this state of
Human Nature, to be irremediable. It is therefore hoped,
that the state of this Church and Kingdom is not so deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
as to want a Settlement while these Dissents remain.
Moreover, there are private dissents between particular
men, within the latitude of the Publike Rule; and there
are dissents that may be called Publike, as being from the
Publike Rule, or some parts thereof. Now the broader
and more comprehensive the Rule is, the fewer will be the
Dissenters from it. And the permission of private diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of Opinion, in a just Latitude within the Rule, is
the means to lessen Publike Dissents, and consequently,
Dissentions much more. And this was the main scope of
the first <hi>Discourse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great importance of <hi>Vnity in the Church of Christ,</hi>
is acknowledged and contended for as much on this side, as
on the other: Howbeit, we do not believe that Christ
our Head hath laid the Conservation and Unity of His
Church, upon unwritten and unnecessary Doctrines, and
little Opinions, and Sacred Rites and Ceremonies of meer
Human Tradition and Institution. But He hath set out the
Rule and Measure of Unity in such sort, as that upon Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
in those things, the Members of this Society might
not break into Schisms, to a mutual condemnation and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency.
The imposing of such things (except in those
Ages whose Blindness and Barbarism disposed them to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
and gross security in their Religion) hath been ever
found to break Unity, and to destroy, or much impair
Charity, Goodness, Meekness and Patience, which are
Vital Parts, and chief Excellencies of Christianity.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Whether the present Dissentions are but so many Factions in
the State.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ONE grand Objection is, <hi>That the Dissentions among us,
are but so many several Factions in the State.</hi> But, meer
dissents in Religion, are no State-Factions at all, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a more lasting Cause, than particular Designs,
or any temporary Occasions, even from the incurable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
of our Nature. And if it were granted, That the
Dissentions were State-Factions; yet, they are not so ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
and radically, but by accident. Some may take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to raise and keep up Factions by them. For this
cause, take out of the way the stumbling-block of need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
rigors, and then Dissentions will cease or languish, and
consequently, the State Factions (if there be any such that
are kept up by them) will come to nothing.</p>
            <p>It is so evident, that <hi>Toleration,</hi> which came not in till
after the breach between the Late King and Parliament,
<hi>did not open the avenues to our Miseries,</hi> that one may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any should say it did. But, meet Indulgence to all sound
Protestants, is the likeliest means of stopping such avenues.
And, <hi>if it be for the Interest of England to have no Factions,</hi>
the best way is to remove those burdens, which, like a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition-wall,
hath kept asunder the Professors of the same
Religion: Then <hi>the Masters of our Troubles</hi> (whosoever
they be) <hi>cannot have that advantage by their Eminency in
their Parties, to drive on their Designs in the State.</hi> Factious
Spirits are disappointed, when Honest Minds are satisfied
and secured.</p>
            <p>This Author relates the Aims of several Parties on this
manner: <hi>The Papists are for the Supremacy of the Bishop of</hi>
Rome; <hi>some of the other Sects are for a Commonwealth;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53300:8"/>
others are for the Fift Monarchy.</hi> But, if the true state of the
<hi>Nonconformists</hi> be well considered, it will be found, that
in Them, as well as any others, the King and Kingdom is
concerned, and the good of Both promoted. It is not with
them, as with the Popish Party, who have such a severed
Interest to themselves, that the State is little concerned in
it, save onely to beware of its Incroachments. But the
Protestant Dissenters, are such as do much of the Business
of the Nation, and have not their Interest apart, but in
strict conjunction with the whole Body-Politick. Yea,
they have no possible means of ensuring their Interest, but
by Legal-Security obtained from the Higher Power, and by
comporting with the general tranquility both of the Church
and State of <hi>England.</hi> They cannot flye to the Refuge of
any Foreign Prince or State, (as the <hi>Papists</hi> have done fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently)
they acknowledg no Foreign Jurisdiction, (which
is a Principle of the <hi>Popish Faith)</hi> but all their Stake lies at
home, and they can have no sure Hold that is aliene from
the Happiness of the King and Kingdom. An Impartial
Observer cannot but discern this. If it be lawful to name
a thing so much to be abhorred, as a Change of the Ancient
Laws and Government, they could not be happy, nor do
their Work by such an unhappy Change. Experience wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth,
That their Interest is not for hasty and unstable
Victory, or unfixed Liberty; but, for a state of firm Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
and Security; and that they cannot hold their
own, but by the common Safety both of Prince and
People.</p>
            <p>The summ of this Matter is, That a Party not onely
comporting with the good Estate of this Realm, but even
subsisting by it, and therefore firmly linked unto it, should
not be cast off.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Whether the NONCONFORMISTS Principles tend to
Sects and Schisms.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>SOme Reasons were offered to shew, That Indulgence
towards Dissenting Protestants, did much concern the
Peace and Happiness of this Realm. And the Prudent
will judg Arguments of that sort to be of the greatest
weight in the Affairs of Government. There is no need to
reinforce the cogency of those Reasons: The Adversary
hath wrested them to an odious meaning, contrary to their
manifest true intent; but whether he hath indeed evinced
them to be of little or no moment; or, whether they stand
in full force, let judicious men consider. The whole reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that particular, rests upon this Maxime, That it is the
SOVEREIGN's true Interest, to make his divided People
to be one among themselves, and to keep them all in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
upon Himself, as the Procurer of their common
safety.</p>
            <p>The Prejudices that have been conceived, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
that have been raised against the <hi>Nonconformists,</hi>
gave occasion of resolving this Question, <hi>Whether they be
of a judgment and temper that makes them capable of being
brought under the Magistrates Paternal Care and Conduct, to
such a stated Order as will comport with this Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</hi>
This, by the <hi>Answerer,</hi> is termed <hi>a Dialect of Canting,</hi>
and is wilfully wrested into a Question of another nature.
Whether he had occasion given him to speak so scornfully,
let any judg that understand sober language. But, that
they might appear uncapable of a Comprehension, he
sticks not to affirm, <hi>That the Principles of Presbyterian Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
do not admit of any stability, but may be drawn out
to patronize the wildest Sects that are or have been.</hi> And his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53300:9"/>
main proof is taken from the bare word of Two of their
Eminent Adversaries. He might have remembred, That
the same Reproach is cast upon the Principles of <hi>Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi>
by <hi>Romish</hi> Writers. One may well ask, Where is
the Truth and Candor of those men that write after this
manner? Consider the <hi>French, Dutch, Helvetian</hi> Churches,
how intire they keep themselves in Orthodox Unity, from
the Gangrene of Sects and Schisms. The Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
whilst it was <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> was inferior to none in the
Unity of Doctrine and Church-Communion. Did <hi>Prelacy</hi>
ever effect the like Unity in the Church of <hi>England?</hi> And
shall the Sects that now are, or lately were in this Nation, be
charged upon <hi>Presbytery,</hi> that was never setled among us;
and against which the Sectaries had the greatest indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Though that Way never obtained in <hi>England,</hi> nor was
favoured with the Magistrates vigorous aid, yet it is very
untrue, <hi>that the first admirers and friends thereof, grew
sick of it, and hissed for the other Sects to affront, reproach
and baffle it.</hi> It is well known, that it received those disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from another sort of men.</p>
            <p>The asserting of this Government, is far from the design
of this or the former Treatise; yet it may be lawful to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
it from unjust aspersions. The <hi>Answerer</hi> is pleased to
stile it, <hi>No other but a Sect.</hi> I hope he doth not intend to
make the Foreign Reformed Churches, but so many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations
of Sectaries. If his meaning be, that is no better
than a Sect in <hi>England, because another Government is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by Law,</hi> let him tell us, Whether <hi>Episcopacy</hi> would
be a Sect, if it should appear in those Countries where <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi>
is the Legal Government? No less will follow, if the
Notion of Sect be extended so far, as to fetch in whatsoever
dissents from the Order by Law established.</p>

            </p>
            <q>
               <p>We humbly beseech Your Majesty to believe, That
we own no Principles of Faction or Disobedience, nor
patronize the Errors or Obstinacy of any. It is granted
us by all, That nothing should be commanded us by man,
which is contrary to the Word of God: That, if it be,
and we know it, we are bound not to perform it, God
being the Absolute Universal Sovereign: That we must
use all just means to discern the Will of God, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Commands of Men be contrary to it: That, if
the Command be sinful, and any through neglect of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
search, should judg it Lawful, his culpable Error
excuseth not his doing it, from being sin: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as a reasonable creature must needs have a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of discerning, that he may rationally obey it;
so is he with the greatest care and diligence, to exercise it
in the greatest things, even the obeying of God, and the
saving of his Soul: And that where a strong probability
of a great Sin and Danger lieth before us, we must not
rashly run on without search: And that to go on against
Conscience where it is mistaken, is sin and danger to him
that erreth. And on the other side, we are remembred,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53300:10"/>
that in things no way against the Law of God, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of our Governors must be obeyed; but if they
command what God forbids, we must patiently submit
to suffering, and every soul must be subject to the Higher
Powers for Conscience sake, and not resist: The Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Judgment, Civil or Ecclesiastical, belongeth only
to publike persons, and not to any private man: That
no man must be be causlesly or pragmatically inquisitive
into the reasons of his Superiors Commands; nor by
Pride and Self-conceitedness, exalt his own understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above its Worth and Office; but all to be modestly
and humbly self-suspicious: That none must erroneously
pretend to God's Law, against the just Command of his
Superiors, nor pretend the doing of his duty to be a sin:
That he who suspecteth his Superiors Commands to be
against Gods Laws, must use all means for full informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
before he settle in a course of disobeying them:
And that he who indeed discovereth any thing comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
to be a sin; though he must not do it, must manage
his Opinion with very great care and tenderness of the
Publike Peace, and the honour of his Governors. These
are our Principles: If we are otherwise represented to
Your Majesty, we are mis-represented: If we are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of contradicting them, we humbly crave that we may
not be condemned before we be heard.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This is sound speech that cannot be reproved. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the Clemency of their Superiors shall remit those
Injunctions that may wellbe dispensed with, and unto which
they cannot yeeld conformity for fear lest they sin against
God; their Principles will dispose them with an humble
and thankful acquiescence, to receive so great a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>

               <p>Of placing them in the same rank for Crime and Guilt, with

            </argument>
            <p>THE <hi>Answerer</hi> hath not feared to set the <hi>Papists,</hi> and
the <hi>Protestant Dissenters,</hi> upon the same level, in the
guilt of Rebellion, Cruelty and Turbulency. For a high
Charge having been made good against <hi>Popery, That it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposeth
Subjects to Rebellion: That it persecutes all other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
within its reach: That wheresoever it finds encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it is restless, till it bear down all, or hath put all in
disorder:</hi> He comes and tells the World, That the <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists
are no more innocent of the same Crimes.</hi> Can men
of sound minds and temperate spirits, believe this? And
what greater advantage can be given the <hi>Popish Party,</hi> then
that a <hi>Protestant Writer</hi> should declare and publish, that so
great a part of <hi>Protestants</hi> are equally involved with them
in those heinous Crimes with which the <hi>Protestants</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
charged them? And that such a one should tell them,
<hi>That it will seem unequal to deny a Toleration to them, and
grant it unto others that are here pleaded for;</hi> which is in
effect to say, They have as good reason to expect an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
from this State, as others that maintain the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yea, such as communicate
in her publike Worship. Is there no better way of exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Prelacy,</hi> and disgracing its supposed Adversaries, then
by this Reproach and Damage done to the whole <hi>Protestant</hi>
Profession? Yea, he so far extenuates the guilt of <hi>Papists,</hi>
and brings it down so low, as to make it common to all
other Sects. In which one would think he should have
been more wary, who in one place stretcheth the notion
of <hi>Sect</hi> so far, as to make its reason to lye in being different
from the Established Form of Church Government. Now
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53300:11"/>
for matter of practice, he imputes the same guilt to all other
Sects; <hi>And if the Papists</hi> (saith he) <hi>have any Doctrines
which countenance those Practises, that is to be accounted as
the issue of their insolency in their own greatness.</hi> And he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
That it is onely the want of strength, that other
Sects are not so bad as they for such kind of Doctrine, as
well as Practice. Such passages falling from a <hi>Protestants</hi>
Pen, may do the <hi>Papists</hi> better service than their late Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.
But why doth he say, <hi>If the Papists have any such
Doctrines?</hi> Doth he not know they have? The Church of
<hi>England</hi> was assured of it, when concerning the Adherents
of <hi>Rome,</hi> she used this expression in a publike form of
Prayer, <hi>Whose Religion is Rebellion, and whose Faith is Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
We wish their eyes were open, who cannot see more
permanent and effectual causes of the aforesaid Crimes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to that Religion, and rooted in the Principles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
The evidence hereof given in the former <hi>Discourse,</hi>
is not needful to be rehersed in this place.</p>
            <p>This Author (as others that oppose the wayes of Amity
and Peace) loves to grate upon a string that sounds harsh,
To renew the remembrance of the late Warr. Those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
Times, are the great Storehouse and Armory, out
of which such men do fetch their Weapons of offence;
and the great Strong-hold, unto which they always retreat
when they are vanquished by the force of Reason, and
then they think they are safe, though therein they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
the true intent of the Act of Oblivion. Some of those
that now so importunately urge the Injury and Tyranny
of those Times, did then suf<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iciently comply with Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;
and left <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to sink or swim; and did partake
of the chiefest Favours and Preferments that were then
conferred. And on the other hand, such as they upbraid,
and are now Sufferers, did as little comply with those that
subverted the Government, and did as zealously appear
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53300:11"/>
for the rescue of our late Sovereign, and for the restitution
of His present Majesty, as any sort of men in the Realm.
But to intermeddle in the Differences of those Times, and
to repeat Odious Matters, and to use Recriminations that
will disturb the minds of men, and tend to a perpetual Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
is aliene from, and opposite unto my Pacifick Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
As for his charging the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> with certain
Doctrines and Positions by him there mentioned (which I
know none that maintains) and other Accusations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
relating to the time of the Warr; the Truth or Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
the Equity or Iniquity, the Candor or Disingenuity
of his Testimony in those things, is left to the judgment of
the Righteous God, and of Impartial Men.</p>

            <p>ANother part of the Proceeding is very Unrighteous
and Presumptuous. The Dissenting Ministers appeal
to God, That they dare not Conform for Conscience sake.
This Author hence inferrs, <hi>The force of the Argument is,
There is a Necessity of Toleration, because they Will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
Is a Cannot for Conscience sake,</hi> of no more force than
a bare <hi>Will not?</hi> But who best knows their hearts, themselves
or their Adversaries? He would make the world believe,
that not Conscience, but Obstinacy and Faction, is the
cause of their holding out, <hi>and that the greatest part were
trapann'd into Nonconformity.</hi> That trifling story of their
being trapann'd, is not worthy of serious discourse. It is so
evident, as not to be denied, That about the time the Act of
Uniformity was to be put in practice, there were motions
and overtures of Indulgence from the King and some of the
great Officers of State, who were known to have high af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and esteem for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53300:12"/>
and promote those Overtures as the best Expedient
for the setling of this Church and Kingdom. But to let
that pass, Can men of Understanding and Candor think,
that so many serious persons, who as well as others, may be
thought to love themselves, their Families and Relations,
should continue such egregiously obstinate Fools, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
the Comforts of their Temporal Being, for a Humor,
and remain in a state of Deprivation, into which they had
been meerly trapann'd? As for the objected <hi>unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their returning,</hi> how doth it appear? What hinders
their Capacity of gaining Benefices, yea and Dignities, if
they could Conform? Why should they not find as good
acceptation as others, in their Preaching and Conversation?
It may be they would enter too fast, for the good liking of

much as in any others, of a National Settlement, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Composure, did accelerate His Majesty's Peaceable
Restauration. Surely they were not so stupid as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that great Turn of Affairs, without the thoughts of
their own yeilding, and such as they hoped would be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
with those of the other Perswasion. Their early and
ready Overtures of Reconciliation, which are publikely
made known, will testifie their Moderation, to the present
and future Ages. Their Offers of Acquiescing in <hi>Episcopacy</hi>
Regulated, and the <hi>Liturgy</hi> Reformed, was on their part, a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53300:12"/>
good advance towards Union. His Majesty hath given this
Testimony of them in His Declaration: <hi>When We were in</hi>
Holland, <hi>We were attended by many Grave and Learned Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
from hence, who were looked upon as the most able and
principal Assertors of the</hi> Presbyterian <hi>Opinions, with
whom We had as much Conference as the multitude of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
which were then upon Vs, would permit Vs to have; and
to Our great Satisfaction and Comfort, found them persons
full of Affection to Vs, of Zeal for the Peace of the Church
and State, and neither Enemies (as they had been given out to
he) to</hi> Episcopacy <hi>or</hi> Liturgy, <hi>but modestly to desire such altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as without shaking Foundations, might best allay the
present Distempers which the indisposition of the Time, and
the tenderness of some mens Consciences had contracted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wonder at the confidence of that Assertion in the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That it is sufficiently known, That none of the present
Nonconformists did in the least measure agree in the use of those
little things; and though desired by the King to read so much of
the Liturgy as themselves had not exception against, and so
could have no pretence from Conscience.</hi> For it is well known,
that some of them did in compliance with the Kings desire,
read part of the Liturgy in their Churches. As for others
that did not, perhaps for the prevention of scandal they
might use their liberty of forbearance till some Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were obtained. The truth is, the Concessions on this
side have been abused, to the reproach and disadvantage
of the depressed Party; and from their readiness to yeild
so far as they can, for the common peace sake, a perverse
inference is made, That they might yeild throughout, if
Humor and Faction did not rule them. Is there any Justice
or Charity in such dealing? May not men of upright Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
and peaceable Inclinations, forbear the insisting
upon some things to them very desirable, and give place to
some things not approved by them as the best in that kind,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53300:13"/>
if so be they might obtain their Peace and Liberty, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
granted them in other things, wherein Conscience
binds them up that they cannot yeild? Moreover, some
Concessions made by particular men of very Catholick
spirits, in the earnest pursuit of Peace, have been wrack'd
and wrested to a sense beyond their true import; and then
they that so handle them, triumph in their own conceit,
over them, as if they had given up the whole Cause. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasnly
they are ill employed, who from their Brethrens
yeelding offers, raise Opposition against them, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to set them further off.</p>

it is unnecessary; for Prejudices being removed, and the

And indeed, the generals that are expressed, are a sufficient
indication thereunto. His Majesty's Declaration concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

on both sides, and that Harmony of Affections
therein, He calls excellent Foundations to build upon. The
Moderation and Indulgence there specified, would do the

            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:53300:13"/>
The former <hi>Discourse</hi> had this position, That the Ends
of Church-Discipline do not require a Constitution of
narrower bounds, then things necessary to Faith and Life,
and Godly Order in the Church. The <hi>Answerer</hi> saith,
That <hi>this Establishment is not enough for a Settlement, because
it doth not secure the Peace.</hi> And to shew the insufficiency
thereof, he giveth two instances of Discord between the
Parties; First, about <hi>the Persons to whose care the great
things of Christianity should be intrusted to see them conveyed
unto Posterity, whether they shall be a Single Person, or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory,
or each single Congregation.</hi> Secondly, About <hi>the
means of conveying those things, the Worship of God, and the
Circumstances thereof.</hi> From hence he draws this Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Therefore to preserve Peace among her Members, the
Church had need to determine more then the great things of
Christianity; and to injoyn more then what is barely necessary
to Faith and Order.</hi> Verily, it may much amuse one to think
what that thing should be in the Ecclesiastical Polity, which
is not necessary to Christian Faith and Life, and godly Order
in the Church, and yet necessary to secure the Church's
Peace. And if the aforesaid Instances of discord between the
<hi>Church of England</hi> and the <hi>Dissenters</hi> are not necessary to
Faith or Order, what reason can be rendred of the inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Imposition thereof, upon dissenting or doubting
Consciences? Can it be necessary to the Church's Peace,
to exclude or deprive men for such Differences in which
neither Faith nor Order are concerned? Or is this the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer</hi>'s
meaning, That the Church's Peace consists in the
exclusion of the <hi>Nonconformists;</hi> and that the necessary use
of some Injunctions, stands in keeping them out; so that
not their Conformity, but their Exclusion is the thing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
intended?</p>
            <p>The Comprehension doth not suppose (as it is mis-report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<hi>That Presbytery should be permitted or encouraged.</hi> All
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53300:14"/>
intermedling with the Form of Church-Government, was
declined; only the prescribed Uniformity was considered.
Besides, for the exact <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Form to be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> is contradictory; yet that something of
<hi>Presbytery</hi> should be included in it, is not repugnant. And
such a Comprehension is approved in His Majesty's afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Declaration. Likewise King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the First,
in His Discourse touching the Differences between Himself
and the Two Houses, in this point, declares that <hi>He is not
against the managing of the Episcopal Presidency in one man,
by the joint Counsel and Consent of many Presbyters; but that He
had offered to restore it as a fit means to avoid those errors, and
corruptions and partialities which are incident to any one man;
also to avoid Tyranny, which becomes no Christians, least of all
Church-men.</hi> But neither this nor the former Treatise, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
in this Matter, but leaves it to the Wisdom of our
Superiors.</p>
            <p>The desired Latitude leaves not the Concernments of
Church or State <hi>to the Ingenuity of Men,</hi> nor casts out any
Injunctions that are means of Peace and Unity; yea, or of
that necessary Decency which the Apostle requires; only
of Rites and Opinions long disputed, it would take in no
more then needs must; and not meerly because they have
been long disputed, but because they are also of little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
(and here confessed not to be necessary to Faith and
Order) yet are matters of endless Controversie in this
Church, and occasions of great separation from it.</p>
            <p>It being asserted, That the indisputable Truths of
Faith, and the indispensable Duties of Life, are the main
Object of Church-Discipline, the <hi>Answerer</hi> demands, <hi>What
are those indisputable Truths, since there is scarce any Truth
of Faith that hath not been disputed against?</hi> What manner
of arguing is this? Because All Truths have been disputed,
doth it follow, that there are no indisputable Truths? That
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53300:14"/>
is called Indisputable, that cannot reasonably or justly be
disputed, though men of corrupt minds, and reprobate
concerning the Faith, will call the greatest Truths in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
and resist the clearest Evidence. When the Apostle
mentions matters of doubtful disputations, he implies there
be matters that are indubitable.</p>

               <p>Of acquiescence in the Commands of Superiors, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
matter of their Injunctions.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN the former Treatise this Argument was used. The
Church doth not claim an Infallibility, therefore the
cannot settle the Conscience by her sole Warrant, but still
leaves room for doubting. The <hi>Answerer</hi> makes this to be
either a piece of ignorance, or <hi>of portentous malice,</hi> and
an Assertion <hi>that would disturb all Government both in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
and in the State, that would confound all Society, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
Faith and Justice from among the sons of men.</hi> But
this his strange Inference rather is portentous. That the
Church cannot settle the Conscience by her sole Warrant,
is it not a Principle maintained by all <hi>Protestants</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to the <hi>Popish</hi> implicit Faith, and blind Obedience?
But is this person consistent with himself? For after he hath
a while expatiated in his imaginary hideous Consequences,
he comes himself to deny that the Church bindeth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
by her own Authority. And yet it is a lesser thing
to <hi>bind</hi> the Conscience, than to <hi>settle it, and leave no room
for doubting.</hi> For Conscience may be obliged, when it is
not setled. And if the Church cannot oblige, doubtless she
cannot settle the Conscience by her sole Authority. How
then could a man of reason draw such hideous Inferences
from that Position? If I may give way to conjectures, I su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
that he might take check at the word <hi>Infallibility,</hi> by
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53300:15"/>
which I intend no more then Infallible Direction; and I
fear not to own this Assertion, That whosoever have not
Infallible Direction, or the certain assistance of an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Guide, so as to be exempted from all error in what they
propound for Belief or Practice, cannot settle the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
by their sole warrant.</p>
            <p>I still aver, That in prescribed Forms and Rites of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
the Conscience that doth its office, will interpose
and concern it self. And it is matter of astonishment that
a Learned <hi>Protestant</hi> should say, this Position must needs be
false. For Conscience guided by the fear of God, will use
all just means to discern his Will, and cannot resign it self
to the dictates of men in the points of Divine Worship.
If the Judgment of Discerning, which makes men differ
from Brutes, be to be exercised in any case, it is chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
in these matters wherein the Glory of God, and the
Saving of the Soul is so much concerned.</p>
            <p>It is granted, That to maintain Peace and Unity in the
Church, and to be obedient to the Higher Powers in those
things which are proper matter for their Commands, are
most strictly injoined Duties. But the Injunctions here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
(though to the Imposers they are but things Indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
that is, neither Commanded nor Forbidden of God) in
the Consciences of Dissenters, are Unlawful. To instance
in some controverted Ceremonies, They think that God
hath determined against them, though not in particular,
yet in the general Prohibition of all uncommanded Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
And they reply, <hi>Whether it be right in the sight of God
to hearken unto men more then unto God, judg ye.</hi> To restrain
that of the Apostle, <hi>He that doubts is damned if he eat,</hi> only
to things wherein the Church hath not interposed her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
is a false gloss, and a begging of the Question.
What human Authority can warrant any one to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
an unlawful or suspected Action, or to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53300:15"/>
of a known or suspected Falshood? As concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Rights of Superiors, it is the Church's Duty and
Honour to teach and command her Children to do whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Christ hath commanded. And it is the chiefest Glory,

            <argument>
               <p>Of the alledged Reasons of the Ecclesiastical Injunctions in
the beginning of the Reformation.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE <hi>Answerer</hi> relates at large the proceeding of this
Church in the beginning of the Reformation. The
sum of the Relation is, <hi>That there being Two sorts of men,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53300:16"/>
one that thought it a great matter of Conscience to depart from
the least Ceremony, they were so addicted to their old Customs;
the other so new-fangled, that they would innovate all things,
and nothing would satisfie them but that which was new; It
was necessary for the Church to interpose for Peace sake, and
casting off neither Party, to please each to their edification;
and also to injoyn some things to the common observance of all,
and therefore she took away the excessive multitude of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
as those that were dark, and abused to Superstition
and Covetousness, but retained those few that were for Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Discipline, and apt to stir up the dull mind of man to the
remembrance of his duty to God.</hi> We have good warrant to
call in question the truth of his Narration in things of the
greatest weight. First, It is not true that <hi>the Party that
were for Ceremonies, comprehended all those who staid at
home, and did not flye in the time of Queen</hi> Mary's <hi>Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
For such as dissented from the Ceremonies in the
time of that Persecution, had their Assemblies for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God in this Land, and indured among others, in
the Fiery Trial. And we can find but little zeal in the
Martyrs of those days for this kind of Conformity. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it is not true <hi>that the Party that were against Ceremonies,
were but small, as being but some few of those that fled beyond
Sea:</hi> There is clear evidence to the contrary. An Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
zealous for Conformity, even unto bitterness, reports
in his <hi>Ecclesia Restaurata,</hi> That in the beginning of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, many that were disaffected to <hi>Episcopacy</hi>
and Ceremonies, were raised to great Preferments. Besides,
those that were in Ecclesiastical Dignities, he observes, That
the Queens Professor at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the <hi>Margaret</hi> Professor
in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> were among the <hi>Nonconformists.</hi> For the
multitude of <hi>Dissenters</hi> in those dayes, there is a notable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of a Friend of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> in his Letter to Mr. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Hooker,</hi> about the writing of his <hi>Ecclesiastical Polity,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:53300:16"/>
in these words: <hi>It may be remembred, that at the first the
greatest part of the Learned in the Land, were either eagerly
affected, or favourably inclined to that way; the Books then
written, savoured for the most part, of the Disciplinary stile;
it sounded every where in the Pulpits, and in the common
phrase of mens speech; and the contrary Part began to fear
they had taken a wrong course.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is as little Truth and Justice in that report, <hi>That
the Party that were against Ceremonies, caused the Troubles at</hi>
Frankford, <hi>and brought a Dishonor to the Reformation, and
Infamy upon our Nation.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> Congregation at
<hi>Frankford,</hi> was setled after the Discipline of the Foreign
Reformed Churches, and enjoyed much Peace, till certain
eminent men, zealous of the <hi>English</hi> Forms and Rites,
came among them, and by a high hand brought in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
and brake them to pieces, and forced away the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
and those Members that were in the first forming
and setling of that Church. Afterward, they that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and received the Liturgy, continued not long in unity,
but in a short time an incurable and scandalous Schism
brake out between the Pastor, and almost the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
            <p>Lastly, There is a great mistake in the main business of
the Narrative, in representing things as setled by the
Church of <hi>England</hi> in the beginning of the Queen's Reign,
to please each Party in the abolishing of some, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of other Ceremonies: Whereas at the reviving
the Reformation at that time, the Ceremonies then abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
were offensive to all Protestants, and nothing appears
to be done in favour of the <hi>Anticeremonial</hi> Party, about
the points in difference. But things were carried to a
greater height against their Way, than in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s
time, whose Reformation was thought to incline more to
that which was afterwards called <hi>Puritanism.</hi> For which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53300:17"/>
cause the Historian before mentioned, hath written, <hi>That
that King being ill principled, his Death was no infelicity to
the Church of England.</hi> The truth of the matter is, That
in the first Times of the Queen, whose Reign was to be
sounded in the Protestant Religion, the Wisdom of the
State intended chiefly the bringing over of the whole Body
of the People, and to settle them in that Profession; and
therefore thought fit to make no more alteration from their
old Forms, then was necessary to be made. Care was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that no part of the Liturgy might be offensive to the
<hi>Papists,</hi> and they accordingly resorted to our Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
for the first Ten years. Also the retaining of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
was a matter of condescention to the <hi>Popish</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the State thereby testifying how far they would stoop
to gain them, by yeelding as far as they might in their own
Way. Now long Experience hath shewed, That what
was done with respect to the Peace of former Times, and
reconciling of <hi>Papists</hi> to <hi>Protestants,</hi> is become an occasion
of dividing <hi>Protestants</hi> from one another, without hope
of converting <hi>Papists.</hi>

               <p>The alledged Reasons, why the Ceremonies are not to be taken

            </argument>
            <p>DIvers Reasons are alledged to prove a continued ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
for these Ceremonies, as, <hi>Because they that
are for the Church, are unwilling to have them taken away:
To revoke them, is to comply with those that will never be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
Imputations have been laid upon the Things injoyned, as</hi>
Antichristian, Idolatrous, Superstitious: <hi>A Warr was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to remove them: And it is a reproach to the Church,
whose Foundation is upon the Truth, to be various.</hi> Hereunto
we make answer: Whosoever delight in the use of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53300:17"/>
Ceremonies, may enjoy their liberty; but let it suffice
them to use it, without laying a stumbling-block before
others, or intangling their Consciences, or hindring all of
a contrary Perswasion from the Ministry, from teaching
School, yea, and from taking any Academical Degree.
With what soberness can it be said, the <hi>Dissenters</hi> will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be satisfied, when hitherto they were never tryed
with any Relaxation or Indulgence, although they have
given evident proofs of their unfeigned desires of Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation?
They do indeed esteem the Ceremonies an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
in the Worship of God; but suppose that some have
been immoderate in disparaging those Rituals; on the other
hand, shall their value be so inhansed, as to be thought
more worth then the Church's Unity, and the exercise of
mutual Charity among its Members? May not the Church
salve her Honour, by declaring, That in remitting these
Injunctions, she meerly yeelds to the infirmity of weak
Consciences? As St. <hi>Paul</hi> declared concerning abstaining
from meats, who had as much power to make a Canon,
as any sort or number of Ecclesiastical persons can now
pretend unto. As concerning the late Warr, it is easier
said then proved, That it was undertaken to remove the
Ceremonies; and it was not so declared by those that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
it. But if it were so indeed, as it is here suggested, let
this Argument be well weighed, A dreadful Warr that
had a dismal issue, was undertaken to remove certain Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
that at the best are but indifferent, therefore let
them never be removed, but still inforced to the uttermost
upon Consciences that disallow them. As for the reproach
of the Church by the appearance of being various, we
conceive the controverted Ceremonies are no Foundation
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor any substantial part of her
Religion, and do therefore hope, that some Indulgence
therein will not fix upon her any brand of Inconstancy.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53300:18"/>
It is objected, That the <hi>Popish</hi> Priests would hereby take
advantage. It seems then, that greater care must be taken
that the <hi>Papists,</hi> who are implacable Adversaries, be not
offended, then that many thousand honestly minded <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
should be relieved. But the strangest Reason comes
up last. <hi>Dissentions about things indifferent, have necessitated
the Church to make these Injunctions:</hi> That is, say the things
are but indifferent, yet great dissentions have risen about
them, and are like to continue without end; therefore the
Church hath been necessitated to impose them with great
severity upon multitudes who esteem them unlawful, and
all for this end, That dissentions may be removed. We
are astonished at this Argument from the Pen of a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man. The truth is, these alledged Reasons have more
of Animosity in them, then of Equity; Charity, or good
Advice. Indeed the Apostle saith, <hi>Mark those that cause
divisions and offences contrary to the Doctrine that ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;</hi>
but he doth not so brand those that scruple unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Traditions, and needless Ceremonies, but adhere to the
intire Doctrine of Christ, and all Divine Institutions.</p>

               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:53300:18"/>
But there is no such difference in the case. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of things Indifferent, hath been mistaken for the
<hi>Grand Case</hi> of the <hi>Nonconformists;</hi> for those points which
are the main reason and matter of their inconformity, are
by them accounted not indifferent, but unlawful, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to be admitted in their practice, till their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
be better satisfied. And it is not irrational to think,
that serious doubtings may arise in sober minds about some
parts of the injoyned Uniformity, and particularly, about
those Ceremonies which seem to draw near to the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy
and moral efficacy of Sacraments, and thereupon
may appear to some not as meer circumstances, but as parts
of Divine Worship, and their Consciences may be struck
with Terror by the sense of God's Jealousie about any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
Worship which Himself hath not prescribed.
Moreover, these Orders and Ceremonies have been matters
of dispute in all times since the beginning of <hi>Protestant</hi>
Reformation. But under the degenerate state of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Churches, by the great Apostacy of the later times,
there could be no occasion of disputing these things, when
Will-worship was generally exalted, and the grossest Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries
had prevailed.</p>
            <p>I question the truth of that Assertion, <hi>That the Dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
cannot name one Church besides ours, in which there was a
Schism made for a Ceremony.</hi> For a great Rent was made
in the Christian Church throughout the World, about a
Ceremony, or as small a matter, to wit, the time of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating
the Feast of <hi>Easter.</hi> But whensoever a Schism is
made, let them that cause it, look to it, and lay it to heart.
<hi>Wo to the world because of offences, and wo to that man by
whom the offence cometh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But we still insist upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That these Rites being at the best but indifferent in
the opinion of the Imposers, the observation of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in reason be esteemed of such importance to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53300:19"/>
of Religion, as the different Opinions about the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
aforesaid are. And who knows not with what animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
and vehemence the Parties that are called <hi>Arminian</hi> and
<hi>Antiarminian,</hi> have fought against one another; and what
dreadful and destructive Consequences they pretend to draw
from each others Opinions? Now put case the more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Party in the Church of <hi>England</hi> should go about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
those Controversies on the one side, or the other,
(and truly they were sometimes determined by a Synod in
His Majesty's Dominions, namely by that of <hi>Dublin</hi> in the
year 1615, also by the greatest Prelates, and most eminent
Doctors in <hi>England,</hi> in the <hi>Lambeth-Articles;</hi> and what
hath been, may again come to pass) would not that side
against whom the Decision passeth, be ready to cry out of
Oppression? Yea, how great a Rent would be made by it
through the whole Fabrick of this Church? Furthermore,
in Ceremonies publikely used, and matters of open pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath thought good to indulge
<hi>Dissents,</hi> as in that of bowing toward the Altar, or the East,
unless it be required by the local Statutes of particular So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.
And in this the Sons of the Church do bear with
one another, according to the direction of the Canons made
in the year 1640. Unto which may be added, That
the Mode of Worship in Cathedrals, is much different
from that in Parochial Churches. Likewise some Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
before their Sermon use a Prayer of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving;
others onely (as the phrase is) bid Prayer. If
these and other Varieties, be no reproach to our Church,
will it reproach her to suffer one to Officiate with a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliss,
and another without it?</p>

               <p>Men differently perswaded in the present Controversies, may
live together in Peace.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT is no vain speculation, <hi>to think we may have peace, if
men perswaded in their Consciences that the controverted
Ceremonies are superstitious, or at the best but Trifles, and that
the Liturgy and Ecclesiastical Polity, need some Reformation,
should be joined with men far otherwise perswaded.</hi> And the
preserving of Peace in that case, doth not suppose or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<hi>that all these differently perswaded men, will be wise on
both sides to content themselves with their own opinions:</hi> But
it supposeth the State, and the chief Guides of the Church,
to be wise, (as it is always requisite they should be) and
that many of Reputation and Eminency on both sides, will
be prudent and temperate, and examples of Moderation to
others, (and not to suppose this is to disparage and debase
our present Age) but above all, it supposeth the Publike
Constitution so well stated and setled, as to be able to curb
the Imprudent and Unsober, and to encourage the Modest
and Well-advised.</p>
            <p>Surely all Dissenters upon Conscience, <hi>will not be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with by the same Conscience, to endeavour the propagation
of their own way in these differences, to the depression of others.</hi>
If some offer to disturb the Peace, can no Rule of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
restrain them? It is a deplorable case indeed, if
there be no remedy but for those that are favoured by the
Higher Powers, utterly to exclude and reject those that
want the like favour and countenance.</p>
            <p>At this day the Church of <hi>England</hi> by Her present La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
or at least Connivence, keeps peace among Her
Sons of such different Perswasions, as formerly stirred up
great Dissentions in this Church. Who is ignorant of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53300:20"/>
Contentions raised about the <hi>Arminian</hi> Controversies in
the several Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and
King <hi>Charles</hi> the First? But in the present Times, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
forbearance on both sides, but chiefly the Church's
Prudence, hath lay'd asleep those Controversies; whereas
if one side presuming upon its Power and Prevalency,
should go about (as formerly) to decry and depress the
other, and to advance and magnifie themselves, and ingross
the Preferments, doubtless the like flames would break
out again. For there is a great dislike and abhorrency
setled at the Heart-root of both these Parties against
each others Opinions; and a sutable occasion would soon
draw it out to an open Contestation. Now if the Church's
Peace and Unity be already maintained in such seemingly
dangerous diversity of Opinion among her Members and
Officers, and those not of the meanest rank, why should
her Prudence and Polity he suspected as insufficient to
maintain Unity and Peace in the indulging of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
perswaded in the now disputed Rites and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions?</p>

               <p>Of DISSENTERS of Narrower Principles, and of
TOLERATION.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE Latitude discoursed in the former Treatise, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
impeached, as providing onely for the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,</hi>
and relinquishing all other Dissenters; for it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
within the Establishment, those of all sorts that
are of Principles congruous to stated Order in the Church;
so that no sort is excluded, whose Principles make them
capable. And was this Capacity any where restrained to
the <hi>Presbyterians?</hi> Some <hi>Nonconformists</hi> are for Moderated
<hi>Episcopacy,</hi> after the form of the Ancient Churches; and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53300:20"/>
divers others, as to particular forms of Government, are
<hi>Latitudinarians;</hi> and others there are besides these, who
would live peaceably under the present Hierarchy, might
they be spared from the personal profession or practice of
some things which they think unlawful or doubtful.</p>
            <p>Moreover, beyond the Established Order, the Latitude
includes a Toleration for those that are of sound Faith,
and good Life, but have taken up some Principles of
Church-Government less congruous to National Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I cannot yeeld to that position, <hi>That only Necessity
can give colour to Toleration, for that it is by the confession of
all, one of those things that are not good in their nature.</hi> I
suppose that Christians bearing with one another in tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
differences, is a branch of Brotherly Love; and
therefore Charity, as well as Necessity, may plead for this
Way of Indulgence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it is objected, That</hi> we want an instance of the safety
of Toleration, in any Nation where the Supreme Governour
had not a standing Army to circumscribe and confine the
Heats of Dissenters in Religion, to their own breasts, and
keep off the destructive Effects of Schism.</p>
            <p>Let me reply, That this Maxime, That no Toleration
of Dissenters, howsoever regulated, can be safely granted
by the Supreme Governour that hath not a standing Army,
makes little for the Safety and Liberty of true Religion.
The <hi>Protestants</hi> that live under the Princes of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Faith, are little beholding to one that publisheth to the
World, That those Princes can with safety tolerate them
no longer then they keep up a standing Army to keep off
the destructive effects of that which they call Schism. One
may see by this and other instances, what bias the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath, by the Zeal of a Party, and how it is brought
to assert such things as may expose the true Religion to the
danger of Suppression or Extirpation in many Countries.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53300:21"/>
But hath the <hi>French</hi> King less assurance of the Loyalty of
His <hi>Protestant</hi> Subjects, then of the <hi>Roman-Catholicks?</hi>
Would a Necessity be laid upon Him to maintain constant
Forces to keep the <hi>Protestants</hi> in obedience, when he could
rule the rest of his People without such Terror? Or is To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
the reason of a standing Army in the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of the <hi>Netherlands?</hi> In this Latitude no other To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
is pleaded for, then what can be made safe and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
by the ordinary ways of Legal Government.</p>
            <p>Both Duty and Interest obligeth all sorts to proceed as
far as it is possible in complying with their Superiors; and
if the uncontrolable Power of Conscience inforce them
to lye without the Pale of the Established Order, they
should deem that Exclusion their great Unhappiness. But
so it is, that Prudent and Pious men may be of exceeding
Narrow Principles about Church-Order and Fellowship.
Christian Charity pleadeth for Indulgence towards them;
and we hope Political Prudence doth not gainsay it. For
although their Way may fall far short of setling a Nation,
yet they may have Spirits and Principles very consistent
with Publike Tranquility. And their Indulgence may be
obtained by a good Understanding and Confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Them and the Higher Powers, the Clemency of
the One shewing Favour in that extent which the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Order may safely tolerate; and the Humility and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion
of the Other, causing them to prise the Favour,
and to use it rightly. That such Condescention and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
should be used on the One side, and such Humility
and Modesty on the Other, why should it seem impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
For the One may see, that by granting some Limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Liberty, the Protection of Christs Flock, and the
Satisfaction of well-minded Subjects may become more
Universal: And the Other may likewise see, that a
smaller Party, and those of Narrow Principles, are of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53300:21"/>
themselves in no wise proportionable to the State of this
Nation; and therefore that they cannot well subsist, but
in conjunction with, and subordination unto an Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more commensurate to the whole Body of the People.
This necessary Subordination, may beget a mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and Security. If it be said, The Tolerated Party
may become Dangerous or Suspected, it is always suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that they stand by their Good Behaviour, and the
Rulers Favour. But they are not like to prove Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
if the Establishment be large enough. For the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowness
thereof makes the <hi>Dissenters</hi> numerous, and still
encreaseth their Number.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>It is the Interest of the NONCONFORMISTS to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Comprehension before Toleration, where Conscience
doth not gainsay.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IF it can be made evident, That the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> should
embrace a Comprehension as the surest means of their
particular Good, it will conduce exceedingly to evince,
That the Favour of Rulers will not be in vain towards
them; and that their Petitions, Discourses, and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
for Moderation, were not feigned, because ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on their true Interest that cannot lye.</p>
            <p>Were they united among themselves, and did the Times
highly favour them, even then it were their Wisdom not
to insist too far upon their own Perswasions, but to comply
with such moderate Order as is most passable in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(their Consciences not gainsaying) much more doth
it now behove them, by Moderation and Submission to
dispose themselves for the Favour of their Superiors.</p>
            <p>They should chuse rather (if it be possible for them) to
be Comprehended in the Approved, then to be Tolerated
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53300:22"/>
in a Severed Way. For there is not so much lost thereby in
point of Liberty, but as much or more is gained in point of
Safety.</p>
            <p>It is a happiness to be secured from dangerous wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
perplexities, breaches, and manifold inconveniences,
into which they may be led that are wholly left without
the Line of the Established Order. Those persons that
by their Wisdom and Learning can the better defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the aforesaid Evils in a severed State, cannot
be ignorant how precipitate and unadvisable many of their
Number may be, and not so easily to be governed by their
more prudent Guides. Men of discerning and stable judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
would do their uttermost to preserve the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate
people from falling into a full and absolute
Separation from all Christian Societies that are not of their
Perswasion. For they may easily apprehend into how great
and dangerous Errors that <hi>Vortex</hi> may carry about those
that fall into it.</p>
            <p>They that are best able to govern themselves, do see
most need of a Publike Government, and how necessary
it is, that both People and Teachers be under the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and Influence of Authority, for the avoiding of
many and great Inconveniencies. And there are many and
great Benefits, by being comprehended in the Approved
Order, not otherwise to be obtained. Their Peace is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
insured, their Influence is more diffusive, their Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Motions for the Common Good, will be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.
They have a larger scope for imploying their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Talent in the Publike Service of the Gospel, and
they may speak with more Authority, and better success
among all ranks and sorts of men, who will look upon
them as theirs, when they hold their Publike Stations.</p>
            <p>Unto all this may be added, That the Ancient <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi>
earnestly opposed the Separation of the <hi>Brownists,</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:53300:22"/>
and held communion with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in its
Publike Worship.</p>
            <p>And doubtless it is the Ministers Interest, not to have
their Subsistence by the Arbitrary Benevolence of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and so to live in continual dependance upon their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
dispositions for a Maintenance that is poor and low
in comparison of the Publike Encouragements. Hereby
one may partly judg, whether Learned and Prudent men
be <hi>Nonconformists</hi> by the pleasure of their own will, or the
constraining-force of Conscience.</p>
            <p>Now their Consciences may be relieved, if they be not
made personally to profess or practice any thing against
the dictates thereof. And retaining their own private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they may well hold to this Catholick Principle,
That in a Church acknowledged to be sound in Doctrine,
and in the Substance or main Parts of Divine Worship,
and not defective in any vital part of Christian Religion,
they are bound to bear with much which they take to be
amiss in others Practice, in which they do not personally
bear a part themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>As concerning a Form of Church-Government, and
Rule of Discipline, Men that understand their own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
cannot for self-ends (as they have been upbraided)
couet the Power of such a Discipline as inevitably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
envy and ill-will, without any temporal profit or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
And if the Higher Powers will not admit such a
Form, (I deliver my own private judgment, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to other mens) this may tend to satisfie the Subjects
Conscience. That Ecclesiastical Government is necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more directed and ordered in the exercise thereof, by
the Determinations of the Civil Magistrate, in places
where the true Religion is maintained, then where it is
persecuted or disregarded. And they that have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Power, must answer to God for it: They that

            <argument>
               <p>It behoves both the Comprehended and the Tolerated, to prefer
the common Interest of Religion, and the setling of the
Nation, before their own particular Perswasions.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>AS those <hi>Dissenters,</hi> whose Consciences will permit,
will best comply with their own good, by entring
into the Establishment, if a door be open for their access:
So they of Narrower Principles, that cannot enter into it,
will be safest within the Limits of such Indulgence as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
would vouchsafe to grant them, with respect to the
Common Good. Men of all Perswasions should rather
chuse to be limited by Publike Rules, with mutual Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
between their Governors and Themselves, then to
be left to the liberty of their own Affections, upon terms
uncertain and unsecure.</p>
            <p>Besides the Concernment of their own Peace, there is
this great Perswasive, That this Advice is a compliance
with that state of things which will best satisfie and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
the Nation, and maintain Reformed Religion against
Popery, and Christianity against Atheism and Infidelity.</p>
            <p>True <hi>Englishmen,</hi> and Lovers of their dear Countrey,
which is impaired and reproached by these breaches, should
yeeld as much to its Wealth and Honour, as their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
can allow. Loyal Subjects and good Patriots should
consider what the Kingdom will bear, and prefer such
bounded Liberty of Comprehension and Indulgence, as
tends to Union, before a loose, though larger Liberty,
that will keep the Breaches open, and the Minds of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
unquiet and unsetled. And it is not of little moment
to mind this, That the high Concerns of Conscience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53300:23"/>
be better secured then in the Peace and Safety of the
excellent Constitution of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>For the Amplitude of Reformed Religion, all true
Protestants should promote an ample Establishme<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
both for the incompassing of all that be sound in that
Profession, as also for the more capacious reception of
those that may become Converts thereunto. And not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the encrease and glory thereof, but its stability in these
Dominions, is promoted by such an ample Establishment.
Witness our great Defence against <hi>Popery,</hi> by the common
zeal of all <hi>Protestants</hi> of the several Perswasions, for <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testancy</hi>
in general. By this concurrent Zeal, the insolencies
of the <hi>Papists</hi> have been repressed, and their Confidences
defeated. Could the <hi>Protestant Conformists</hi> or <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi>
either of them upon their own single account, if one
should exterminate, or utterly disable the other, be so well
secured against <hi>Popery,</hi> as now they are by their common
Interest? And to imagine by rigor to compel the depressed
Party to incorporate with the Party advanced, so that one
should acquire the Strength of both, would in the issue be
found a great Error. By such proceeding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indeed, a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may be wounded and broken, and rendred unservice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the common good, but shall never be gained as an
addition of Strength to those who have so handled them.
But an Accommodation would make both to be as one.
And seeing in their present divided state, the concurrent
Zeal of Both hath been so formidable, as to dash the hopes
of the <hi>Popish</hi> Party, how much more in a state of Union,
might their Strength increase against their common Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries!
Wherefore, the One should open the Way, and
the Other should readily come in upon just Terms. This
should be the rather minded on both sides, because the
Considerate <hi>Nonconformists</hi> will never promote their own
Liberty by such ways and means as would bring in a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53300:24"/>
of <hi>Popery;</hi> yea, they would rather help to bear
up the present Ecclesiastical state, then that <hi>Popery</hi> should
break in by <hi>Anarchy,</hi> or the Dissolution of all Church-Government.</p>
            <p>Moreover, an ample, fixed state Ecclesiastical, is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to uphold and encrease true Religion, as well against <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,</hi>
as against <hi>Popery.</hi> The loose part of the World would
turn to a weariness and contempt of Divine Institutions,
and Christianity it self would be much endangered in a
state of Ataxy and unfixedness. By what ordinary means
hath the Doctrine and Institution of Christ been propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and perpetuated in large Kingdoms and Nations, and
in the Universe, but by incompassing under its external
Rule and Order, great Multitudes that may fall short of
the Life and Power thereof. And it doth not root and
spread in any sort considerable, in a Region, where the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Order is set by the Rigid and Narrow Principles of
a small Party, and the general Multitude lyes open as wast
ground, for any to invade or occupy. Let considerate
men judg how much the ample state of a meer Orthodox
Profession, is to be preferred before <hi>Infidelity,</hi> or <hi>Popery,</hi> or
any other Sect of the Christian Name, that is Idolatrous or
Heretical. There be few Converts to the Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
from Infidelity or Popery, or any Heresie, but they
are generally made out of the Mass of People of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Profession.</p>
            <p>If it be the will of God that one must suffer for the
Cause of Religion, it is more for the Honour of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to suffer from Infidels, then from <hi>Papists;</hi> likewise it
is more for the Honour of Reformed Religion, to suffer
from <hi>Papists,</hi> then from <hi>Protestants.</hi> And if it were at ones
own choice, One should much rather <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi>
suffer in defence of the main Truths of <hi>Christianity,</hi> then
for refusing a Ceremony, or for any other part of <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</hi>

in its return after a proscription of Twenty years;</hi>
and concludes <hi>it must be a Generation or two, not seven
years, that can wear out all those Difficulties.</hi> On the other
side he saith, <hi>Presbytery languished almost as soon as it had a
being,</hi> &amp;c. I perceive <hi>Presbytery</hi> is a great Eye-sore. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
I may be reckoned a <hi>Presbyterian;</hi> and to say
the truth, I am not ashamed of their company that are
commonly called by that Name; yet I have no pleasure
in such Names of distinction. I am of a <hi>Perswasion,</hi> but
not of a <hi>Party;</hi> and whatsoever my <hi>Perswasion</hi> be, it is
Moderate, Catholick and Pacifick. Neither my Design
nor my Principles engage me to maintain the <hi>Presbyterial</hi>
Government. Nevertheless I cannot but take notice with
how little reason the intrinsick Strength of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> or
Weakness of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> is argued from the duration of
the one and the other in this Kingdom. Had <hi>Presbytery</hi> the
Strength of the Civil Power? Or was it ever formed in
<hi>England?</hi> Was it not crush'd while it was an <hi>Embryo,</hi> by the
prevailing Potency of its Adversaries? Look into those
States where it hath been Established, if you would judg
aright concerning it. On the other hand, hath not <hi>Prelacy</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:53300:25"/>
had all the Strength of Law and Power engaged in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
by the Encouragements of Worldly Grandure for its
Favourers, and by Severities inflicted on its Impugners for
above Fourscore years? In which space of time, none
could appear against it without the hazard of utter undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or great Suffering. And though it were thus born up,
not for Seven years, but almost a Century, yet we do not
find that it had worn out the Difficulties of those Times,
which were not so Many and Great as this Author reports
its present Difficulties to be, in its return after a proscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Twenty years. But there is a more excellent and
surer Way, which, it is hoped, may attain to a happier End
in less time then a <hi>Generation or two.</hi> If the Distemper of
Minds were healed, and Unchristian Enmities laid aside,
then Moderation being sincerely begun, would hold on,
and make the Disagreeing Parties to be still more yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and mutually obliging; those Provocations and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
would then cease, by which they have been mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
alienated, and hurried into such Hostilities, and
they would not be tempted in their own Defence (as they
think) to strengthen themselves by Evil Advantages.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Episcopacy</hi> yeeld to a Moderate Course, why should
any prudent <hi>Dissenters</hi> go about to molest it? For in so
doing they would but perpetuate their own trouble and
unquiet state, seeing that diversities of Opinions, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of Discord are like to continue about Forms of
Church-Government, until Forms shall be no more. On
the other side, Why should the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Clergy dread
that Moderation that would render <hi>Episcopacy</hi> more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
inoffensive and acceptable, and put some end to the
hitherto uncessant struglings against it? Are they jealous
that the Structure of their Government may be weakned,
and at length dissolved? They might rather apprehend
it might gain Assistance and Reputation from many that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53300:25"/>
now either by constraint and necessity, or by provocation
and prejudice are made its Adversaries. Who so search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the root of the matter, shall find, That not so much
the <hi>Species</hi> of Government, nor the Forms that are used
as weightier matters, have been the chief stumbling-block,
and the occasions of the greatest disgust and aversation.
Neither the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Office nor Habit, doth affright this
sort of People from hearing a Bishop preach to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification.</p>
            <p>The right and sure way to establish <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in a Land
where <hi>Reformed Christianity</hi> is established, is not to urge
precise Conformity in Opinions and Orders, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things of meer human determination; but to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
soundness in the Faith, Ability and Industry in the
proper Work of the Ministry, and a Conversation becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Gospel; and to discourage Pluralities, Nonresiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
Licentiousness and Idleness in all sorts, who serve not
Christ, but themselves, in their Sacred Functions, and
whose End is onely to live in Pomp, Wealth and Pleasure.
Will the Church-Governors say (as it hath been answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<hi>they are bound up by the Laws; and if Patrons present
unworthy persons which have the Qualifications the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
the Bishops must not reject them; nor can they turn
them out at their pleasure, but must give an account to the
Laws.</hi> To this I reply, If the Admission and Permission
of unworthy Ministers, comes to pass not by the Bishops
Administration, but by the defectiveness of the Laws, why
hath not their Zeal excited them in the space of so many
years, and several Princes Reigns, to endeavour the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of Laws effectual on that behalf, as it hath to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
and make, from time to time, stricter and stricter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
about Conformity and Ceremonies? For we
know no reason why as full and vigorous Laws may not
be made against Ignorant, Negligent and Scandalous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53300:26"/>
as against <hi>Nonconformists.</hi> Conscience, Honour and
Safety, obligeth the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Clergy to turn the edg of
their Discipline the right way, and to shew its energy
and vigor, not about Ceremonies, but the great and
weighty matters of Christian Religion. And I believe that
many worthy Ministers of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> are so
perswaded. Wherefore, in the former Discourse I cast no
evil reflection upon the <hi>Latitudinarians,</hi> or any moderate
persons; nor represented them <hi>as conforming not sincerely,
and as becomes the Ministers of Christ.</hi> They may sincerely,
according to their Principles, submit to these Impositions,
and yet not like the Imposing. The expression of their
<hi>lukewarmness in Conformity,</hi> signified no more but this,
That they set a rate upon these Matters according to the
value, and that they bear but an indifferent respect to things
that at the best are but indifferent.</p>
            <p>It is objected against me, That <hi>having provided a place
of rest for my self and my Party, in the stated Order, I am
little sollicitous for others.</hi> I do here solemnly profess, That
I am chiefly sollicitous for the Tranquility and Rest of a
troubled Nation. As for my own Concernment, my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation
is an Affliction to me; and I would do any thing
that were not sin to me, to recover the liberty of my pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Service in the Church: But if it cannot be, I submit
to His good pleasure, by whose determinate Counsel all
things are brought to pass, and am contented to remain a
Silenced Sufferer <hi>for Conscience towards God.</hi> Yea, I should
much rejoice in such Enlargement of the Publike Rule, as
might give a safe entrance to others, though I my self by
some invincible strictness of Apprehension, should remain
excluded; for I have no Faction to uphold, and by others
Gain I am nothing lessened. And in my opinion, it will be no
dividing of the <hi>Nonconsormists,</hi> or weakning of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
if a part of them might close with the Approved
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53300:26"/>
Order of the Nation, enlarged to the latitude of their
judgments, when others of streighter judgments are left
without. Indeed, if they were a Faction, they might lose
or lessen themselves hereby: But Reformed Christianity is
their Grand Interest, and their main Cause lyes not in any
avowed difference of Doctrines between them and the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal
Protestants,</hi> nor in any Secular Advantages to hold to
themselves in a divided state, but in the Advancement of
Gods Kingdom by the encrease of true Christian Faith
and Piety.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Answerer</hi> hath used many hard speeches against me,
and charged me with Malice in divers passages, which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
not in particular, because the innocence and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siveness
of my words will clear it self; and because I would
not make this <hi>Discourse</hi> tedious, by replying to things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to the main scope. It shall suffice me to add, That
I have written these things, as knowing that <hi>the Judg stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
before the Dore.</hi>
