            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

euerlastingly to haue or

not for our body, euen so must
thys hungrynge &amp; thursting,
be hunger and thurste of the

Wherefore it is conuenyente
that fyrst and foremost I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
vnto you, how the soule
of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made hungry &amp; thur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sty,
&amp; also when it is hungry &amp;
thurstye. Whiche lesson shall
geue a great lyght to all the
rest of our purpose.</p>
            <p>For declaration whereof
ye shall vnderstande that the
<pb facs="tcp:15452:5"/>
soule of man is made hungry
and thurstye by the meanes
and workyng of the law, and
that after thys sorte as I shal
declare vnto you.</p>
            <p>The law worketh foure<note place="margin">Ro. iij. b vij.</note>
thynges for and in the soule
of man, Fyrst and formost the<note place="margin">Gal. iij. Heb. vij.</note>
law maketh the soule of man
knowe and see her offences
and synnes committyd and
done againste the mayestye
of almighty god. And it shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them as lyuely to the eye<note place="margin">i. Co. xiij. Iac. i. c.</note>
of the soule, as a glasse shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the spotes and markes of
mans face vnto hys bodylye
eye. And if the lawe did not
shewe to our soules, oure syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
after thys sort, we should
not know that we be synners
(as Saint Paule witnesseth
<pb facs="tcp:15452:6"/>
to the Romayns.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Peccatum non cognouissem nisi per lege<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
            </q>
            <p>I had not knowen synne but<note place="margin">Ro vij. b</note>
by the law. Therfore is
thys one office and worke of
the lawe to make mans soule
knowe here offences.</p>
            <p>The seconde thynge that
the law worketh for the soule
of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, that it sheweth vnto
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goddes displeasure &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
punishement for synne, &amp;
euerlastinge death &amp; hell fyer
for her offences. <hi>Stipendium peccati
mors</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reward of syn is death.<note place="margin">Ro. v. b. vi. c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The third office &amp; worke
of the law is to make man dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
quiet of hym selfe. For
when the law of God hath ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen
thus muche knouledge to
the soule of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then doth ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
soule begyn, to dispaire and to
<pb facs="tcp:15452:6"/>
thinke verely that there is no
way with her but one which is
euerlasting damnacion.</p>
            <p>Now when mans soule se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
her self in such great daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
then is man in a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
agony and sorow, &amp; quiet
out of all comfort, and is driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to seeke som other meanes for
helpe then at the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of the
law whiche sheweth no mercy<note place="margin">Deut. xxvij. c. xxviij. b. Ie. xi. a.</note>
but extreme punishment. And
for this forssyng that the lawe
straineth man with al, the law
is called pedagogus ad christu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a sholemaster whiche teacheth
man to goo to christ for helpe &amp;<note place="margin">Gal. iij.</note>
this is the fourth office of the
lawe but all men cannot by &amp;
by se christ in this agony, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
nature is so naturally by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
blinded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first man seketh
all other means for helpe and
<pb facs="tcp:15452:7"/>
comfort before it seke for the
true and right helpe. For de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claracion
whereof ye shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande
that when mannes
soule seeth her selfe in suche
daunger, first and formost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture
man will fall to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this or that kynde
of meate, and once or twice a
weeke, or els at some such time
in the yere whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pleasan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenes
of the bloud increaseth
see whether he can pacify God
the father, by that meanes for
that thing wherwith the law
doth charge his conscience or
not. But the law replieth vnto
hym and telleth hym that that
abstine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce whiche he now vseth
wil not satisfie and make ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
for his former offendyng
almighty God. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb facs="tcp:15452:7"/>
him that in absteining now
he doth no more but his duty.
For if absteining from this or
that kynde of meate were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
in the sight of God for
it self, then shoulde man bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
bound to asteine from
this or that kinde of meate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> man is alwaies bound
to doo that thinge whiche is
acceptable in the sight of God.
And so man doing that thyng
whiche semeth to hym accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in the sight of almightie
God, doth nothing els but his

When all thys wyll not serue

And in conclusion she percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

And it is called in scripture y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. xiij.</note>
hungring &amp; thurstinge of the

            <p>So doth our sauiour Christ

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ calleth the desyering

So is this desier called hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gringe
and thurstinge in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
other places of the scryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
As the desier to heare

in the .viij. of Amos.</p>

            <p>He fylled them that were
hungry with good thinges,
That is to say, he satisfied the
desier of them, which instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them selfes and ther own
worckes, and dyd put there

contrarywyse, suche as dyd
put some trust in themselues,

<pb facs="tcp:15452:12"/>
so hungry as the other were,
them he sent away empty, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge
them to themselues.
And in the seuenth of Saynt
Iohn.<note place="margin">Ioh. vij.</note> This desier is likened

saye, if his soule be desierouse
to haue remission of synne, let
hym come to me and dryncke.
And also in the .21. chapter of
the Apocalypse.</p>
            <q>Ego sitienti dabo de fonte aque uite.<note place="margin">Apo. xxi</note>
            </q>
            <p>A will geue to him that is

all these places it is playne,
that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> desier which the soule

               <pb facs="tcp:15452:13"/>
Now then agayn, the scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture
calleth that thing which
doth comfort and satisfye this
desier of the soule, meate and

of man hath that same thinge
geuen vnto her that she desie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

            <p>My metes (sayeth he) is to

            <p>Then he feedeth and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

hungre &amp; thursty soules with

saith our heauenly father to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
man &amp; all men whiche be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortles

Man dispaire not for thy syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

Folow my counsel &amp; although
thy synnes be neuer so greate

not dampne the. Be sory for
thyne offenses, euen from the
botom of thyne hart and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
earnestly to amende thy
former lyfe, &amp; beleue that my
sonne Christe Iesus hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the paynes vpon hym,
that thou hast deseruid for thy
synnes, and thou shalt not be
<pb facs="tcp:15452:15"/>
dampned, but thou shalt haue
life euerlasting. Let his death
ease thy stomake, comfort thy
fearfull and sorowefull hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gringe
soule with the puny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of hys body, and the she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of hys preciouse bloude.
And euen as meat doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

euen so let hys punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,

to saue both the and all the

            <p>I will no more be angrye

Christ will take vpon him to

thy hungrye stomake w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thys

            <p>Feare not any of those daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that sinne, that fleshe, the

            <p>Fyrst and formoste he hath
ouercome synne for thy sake,
in that he hath payd his deth
to me, not for his own sinnes,
but for thy sinnes, and for the
synnes of all the world, so that
allthough thou hast commit-may
<pb facs="tcp:15452:16"/>
so be that he will tempte
the, as in dede he doth daylye
tempt all such as I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
to possesse my kingedome,
but of this thing thou maiest
be well assuerid, that he can
not hurte the, because my son
hath made him, both hys and
thy bonde seruaunt with hys
death.</p>
            <p>The deuell in tempting the
shall be my seruaunt, for I wil
vse him as an instrumente to
trye thy faieth, and to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
thy belefe from tyme to

I suffer him to tempt the
from tyme to tyme, that by
that meanes thou shouldeste
waxe stronger in thy fayeth
and stronger.</p>
            <p>Now seest thou that where
<pb facs="tcp:15452:16"/>
as before tyme thou waste a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed
of the deuell fearinge
that he had rule and power
ouer the: Nowe my sonne
Christe and I do vse hym for
our slaue and bond seruaunt,
to exercyse the fayeth of the

&amp; to punishe the wicked with
continual affliccion and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye.</p>
            <p>My sonne also hath for thy

not after suche a sort as thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gh
it were vtterly take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away,
but he hath so taken it awaye,
that it can not hurt the.</p>
            <p>For whereas before suche
as hath deyed without belefe
in my sonne, went out of thys
lyfe into eternall death: Now
shall death be a dore for the
<pb facs="tcp:15452:17"/>
and them to euerlastinge lyfe,
in so much that thou shalt con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fesse

            <p>It is an vnreuerente, and

immediatly, saiynge:</p>
            <p>How can this fellow geue
vs his fleshe to eat? Is not he
the sonne of Ioseph? Thys
grosse opinion of thers, Saint
Austen calleth heresye, as it is
a playne heresye in dede to
say, that we must eat of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie.
Christ after such a grosse
sort.</p>
            <p>They thought that Christ
had offered hys bodye to be
eaten, as fleshe that hangeth
in the bucherye, so that the
fleshe of his armes, and sydes
that stode there before them,
shoulde be chewed and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of them.</p>
            <p>But (sayth Saint Austen,
that was not hys meaninge:
<pb facs="tcp:15452:21"/>
For that kynde of eatinge of
Christes fleshe, profeteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng

            <p>Caro non prodest quicquam:</p>
            <p>But that they whych were
made sorowfull and hungrye
by the terror of the law, shuld
be fed, and comfortedwith the
death of his fleshe, and wyth
his blessed bloudshedynge.</p>
            <p>And he that feedeth not
hys soule after this sort wyth
Christes fleshe, and bloude, is
not alyue in Christe, but he is
in desperation,</p>
            <q>Manet in morte.</q>
            <p>He dwelleth in death.<note place="margin">Ioh. iii. v. xi.</note> yea

he hath a taste of hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hys conscyence is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortles,
and the worme byteth
him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually, so that he hath

he is alltogether comfortles,
because there is none other
meet &amp; comfort, that can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
oure soules, but onely the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort that we haue by Christ.
And whosoeuer eateth thys
fleshe, and drinketh this bloud
wyth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of belefe, that
thys very fleshe of Christ was
put to death for him, and this
very bloud was once shed for
him: He shall haue euerlasting
life, and the lord will raise him
againe at the latter day. And
he had a tast of the kingdome
of God,<note place="margin">Ioh. vi</note> euen beyng alyue. He
hath peace and quyetnes in
his conscyence. Whyche is
<hi>Gaudium &amp; pax in spiritum sanctum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thys kind of eatinge,<note place="margin">Ro. xiij.</note>
is called of learned men, an
<pb facs="tcp:15452:22"/>
of Christe, <hi>Spiritualiter</hi> (that is to
say) a comfortinge with oure
soules wyth Christ spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And as oft as we comforte
oure soules of thys sorte, we
haue a sure knowledge, and a
felinge that the wrath of god
the father against vs is pacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed,
and so be we of oure for
more hunger eased.</p>
            <p>There is another kinde of
eatinge of Christes body, and
drinkinge of his bloud, &amp; that
is called eatinge and drinking
Sacramentaliter. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally.
And we eate Christ
on this fashion, as oft as we
Ioyne the outward signes of
breade and wyne, (that is to
say) the sacrament of the holy
communion, wyth oure fayth
and inward belefe, receauing
<pb facs="tcp:15452:23"/>
a visible testimony of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
belefe in the face of the
congregacion.</p>
            <p>And if it chaunce any man, to
receaue this outward pledge
and testimony of the lordes
death, &amp; haue not this inward
belefe: the same man, in taking
of that visible Sacrament in
the face of the congregacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth
a lye to the holy gost, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he sheweth him self out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
as though he comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
his soule inwardelye
with Christ, and yet in deed he
doth not and therfor when he
taketh this heuenly Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
his conscience co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
hum, and telleth him that
he is not inwardly so affected,
and disposed as his outward
<pb facs="tcp:15452:23"/>
receauinge of the Sacrament
doth pretend. Wherfore saint
Paule geueth sentence of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
suche man, and sayth.<note place="margin">i. Cor. xi.</note>
            </p>
            <q>Iudicium sibi manducat et bibit.</q>
            <p>He eateth and drynketh his
owne condempnacion and iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gemente
whiche is an vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
kynde of eatinge.</p>
            <q>Quia non diiudicat corpus domini.</q>
            <p>Because he hath no considera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion
why he eatith of that bred
and drynketh of that cuppe,
wherof he eatith &amp; drynketh
for an outwarde Sacrament
and testimony before the hole
congregacion, that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
fed and confortith by
Christus death, but inwardly
indeed he feleth no suche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15452:24"/>
Wherefore thus I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
he that beleueth, eateth:
And he that beleueth not, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not, although he eate the
Sacrament euery day in the
weeke.</p>
            <p>And S. Austen beyng of the
same minde, saith:</p>
            <p>Quid paras dentem &amp; uentrem, crede &amp;
manducasti.</p>
            <p>Why doest thou prepare
thy teeth, and thy bely, beleue
and thou hast eaten.</p>
            <p>Therfore should man proue
hymself (as S. Paule saieth)
and examen diligentlye hys
owne conscience, within hys
breste, and way with him selfe
wel, before he come to this ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
communion, whether he be
indued with the spirit of god,
and lyuely fayth in Christe or
<pb facs="tcp:15452:24"/>
not. And if he perceaue hym
selfe to be a fleshly &amp; a sensuall
man, without faith, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the spirit of almighty god
he ought not to receaue thys
holy sacrament: but to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
him self vntil such time,
as almighty God shall more
plentyfullye indue him wyth
his most heauenly grace. But
if he perceaue by his faith that
he is knyt holly to Christ, and
that he is a liuelye member of
him, let him then goe forward
and eat of this bread &amp; drynke
of this cuppe to his most hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
comfort. And lette hym
say to him selfe on thys wyse,
when he goeth to receaue the
communion. I goe now to
make a solempne professyon
before God and his congrega<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:15452:25"/>
of my fayeth, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
that comfortable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
and misticall pledge
that Christ hath appointed.</p>
            <p>And besydes the quyeting
of myne owne conscience, to
declare to other of the flocke
of Christ, that I beleue assue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redlye,
that oure Sauyoure
Christe shedde hys precyouse
bloude, and dyed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missyon
of my synnes, And
that he, and none but he, hath
geuen me a wysdome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I am returned againe into
the fauor of God. The lawe
told me, that I was not able
of my selfe (searchinge all the
wittes that I had) to returne
againe to God, but Christ.</p>
            <p>Factus est mihi sapientia a Deo.</p>
            <p>Hath geuen me a wisedome
<pb facs="tcp:15452:25"/>
and a knowledge howe to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
with hys helpe agayne to
God. I was altogether wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and vnholly and he hath
made me holy in that he hath
made me partaker of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes.
I was alltogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightuouse,
and he hath made
me rightuouse, in that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
him to make me partaker
of his rightuousnes. By mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
wherof my former offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
shall not be imputed vnto
me. I thought that I coulde
by no means haue pacified the
wrath of God the father, and
haue made amendes for mine
offences, but nowe I am sure,
that Christe is become my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demer,
and hath made a quiet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
&amp; an attonement betwene
almighty god &amp; me. So that
<pb facs="tcp:15452:26"/>

For this ende was the holy

(that is to say for the doiynge

            <p>The right vse of this holy sa

I am not ignoraunt that the
prynted copy of saynt Austen
<pb facs="tcp:15452:31"/>
hath in that place, <hi>Vno loco esse
potest.</hi> (that is) maye be in one
place. But I praye you
what is he that douteth of
that thing, that Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
maye be in one place.</p>
            <p>Surelye Saynt Austen
woulde neuer haue vsed so
vayne a sentence in so weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
a matter, and it is playne
in the decrees.</p>
            <p>De consecratione, distinctionei. ca. Prima
quidem heresis.</p>
            <p>And in the maister of the
sentence in the fourth booke
distinctione decima, that S.
Austen is faslye prynted in
that pointe. For in both these
places ye shal haue these plain
wordes.</p>
            <p>Corpus enim in quo resurrexit in uno loco
esse oporter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15452:31"/>
The body of Christ, in which
he arose, must be in one place.</p>
            <p>These two of there owne
schole be sufficiente witnesses
to me, and to all men, that S.
Austen was playnely of thys
opinion, that Christes bodye
muste be at one tyme in one
place, and can not be at one
tyme in sundrye places.</p>
            <p>In uno loco esse oportet.</p>
            <p>It must be in one place.</p>
            <p>The best waye to confute
this sorte of men, is to set the
one of them agaynst another,
him that sayth that Christes
body is ther naturaliter, natu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rally
against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that say, it is
the natural body of Christ, but
not naturallyter. And them
whiche sayeth that there is a
<pb facs="tcp:15452:32"/>
transubstanciation in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
agaynst them that say,
that ther is the body and the
bread together.</p>
            <p>And them that say, the mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
may eat the Sacrament,
agaynst theim that saye, the
mouse ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not eat it. And them
that say it may moule agaynst
them that say it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not moule.</p>
            <p>And so shal we ease our selfes
of a great deale of paynes, in
sufferinge the one of them to
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute the other, who as they
haue many hedes so haue thei
many wittes, and their is eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as great a confusion amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest
them, as their was amongest
the tonges in babylon, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they striue to hit the
matter, they lightly alwayes
misse eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as men that threshe
<pb facs="tcp:15452:32"/>
heynes blyndfyld.</p>
            <p>But ye wyll say to me.</p>
            <p>Syr ye haue told vs what
some saye, but what say yow?
Forsoth, Sir I say as I haue
sayeth, that Christes blessed
body is not eaten with oure
teeth so grosly and so carnally
as they take it to be.</p>
            <p>But I beleue that that very
body whiche was borne of the
virgine Mary, and was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed,
ded, and buried, and that
very body whiche arose agay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
the third day, and that was
felt of Thomas after Christes
resurrection, that it had fleshe
and bones otherwise then spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
hath, &amp; that whych dyd
eat and drynk with the duci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
after his resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Io. xxi.</note> And
that whiche was seen of the<note place="margin">Act. x.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:15452:33"/>
disciples when it ascendid into
heauen, and that whiche sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
at the right hand of God
the father accordynge to the
article of our Creed: I beleue
(I say) that that body is in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
only, and is not in the earth
accordyngly as Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten<note place="margin">August. tract. L. in Io.</note>
sayth in the 50 treatyse
vpon Iohn.</p>
            <q>Conuersatus est secundutu corporis presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam
quadragintaa diebus cum discipulis suis,
&amp; eis deducentibus uidendo ac sequendo as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendit
in celum: &amp; non est hic, ibi enim sedet
ad dextram patris.</q>
            <p>That is to say. He was here
conuersant wyth the presence
of his body forty dayes with
his disciples, and they goyng
with him, and folowynge him,
he ascendid into heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their
sight: and he is not here, for he
<pb facs="tcp:15452:33"/>
sitteth ther on the right hand
of his father.</p>
            <p>By his diuinitie, his godhed,
hys diuyne mayestye, hys po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and his prouidence, he
is here and euery where.</p>
            <p>But his manhod is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and is in heuen only, and
ther shall he remayne vntyll
the latter day. And yet is it
trew that Christes very body
is present at the mynistracion
of the lords supper. Yea euen
flesh blud and bone as he was
borne of the virgyn Mary.</p>
            <p>Why but what mean I to say
so? Thys geer semeth to be
quiet contrary, to al that euer
I haue sayth befor, his body is
in heuen, and his body is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at the mynistracion of the
Sacrament of hys Supper,
<pb facs="tcp:15452:34"/>
These sayenges seme to be
directly repugnant the one of
them to the other.</p>
            <p>To put you out of dout in
this poynt, ye shal vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
that euen as the sonne which
is far of dystand, is absent
from myne eye and yet is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to my syght euen so is
Christes body absent from
my mouth, and yet present to
my belefe.</p>
            <p>For my belefe ascendith in
to heuen, euen to that body of
Christ, whiche sytteth ther at
the ryght hand of God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whiche is his very trew
and no fantasticall body fleshe
blud and bone as it was bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
of the virgyn Mary.</p>
            <p>And when I receaue the
holy communion,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15452:34"/>
Mea conuersatio est in celis.</p>
            <p>My conuersacion is in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
Wher Christes body is
euen so present to my fayth
as the sone is present to my
sight and as the bred and wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
bepresent to my mouth.</p>
            <p>So that yf I haue no fayth
Christ is not present to me
when I receaue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the body and blud of
Christ:</p>
            <p>Yf I haue fayth Christes
body beynge in heuen in one
onely place is present to my
fayth: and when I receue the
holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion I inbrase him
by fayth, euen fleshe blud and
bone as he was borne of the
virgyn Mary. And so doth al
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through out the hole worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
hange vpon hym and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb facs="tcp:15452:35"/>
them selues with that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
body, beynge in one place of
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though they be disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into neuer so many sundry
places through out the world.</p>
            <p>Thus farre I haue declared
vnto you (most noble audie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce)
The heauenly banket that all
mighty god hath prepared for
the ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of the soule of man,
which notwithstandyng that
it is so comfortable a doctrine,
yet this many yeres it coulde
not be receaued of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, &amp;
therfore may it wel be likened
to that seed, whiche hath bene
lost in the way, &amp; couldnot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to take rote, growe &amp; bring
forth fruite, accordyng to the
expectacion of the seed sower.</p>
            <p>Now because I haue deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to speake somewhat of
<pb facs="tcp:15452:35"/>
the fourth paynt for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyenge
of my promes, I will
leaue &amp; make an end of my for
more matter. and procede to
the latter pece of my purpose
this day. Which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning
what burdes they be, &amp; what
men they be, that hath troden
and deuowered this seed. As
touching the burdes our Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiour
Christ maketh it plaine
sayng, that they figure the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
who inueigleth &amp; inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
so the eares and hartes
of many people with heretical
doctrines and false opinions,
that the good seed of Goddes
most holy word can fynde no
place ther, to take rote grow,
and bring forth fruite. But as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone
as it is sowen, it is by &amp;
by forgotten, and (as it were)
<pb facs="tcp:15452:36"/>
drowned and swalowed vp
amongest wicked opinions of
the martians, the manycheis
the arrians, the Pellagyans
the Libertines, the Annabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes,
and so fort.</p>
            <p>These and suche lyke hath
been the deuelles instrument,
the deuels throte, wherby he
hath deuoureth the seed of
Gods most holy worde.</p>
            <p>And as touchyng the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
of thesame worde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneth
the feete of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people.</p>
            <p>The chefe &amp; arche capitayn
tread worde is the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Biishope of Rome who
(as they report) neuer sayth
masse but he treadith the holy
bible vnder neth his feet in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that he &amp; his ministers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
an aucthoritye greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:15452:36"/>
is thaucthoritye of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
or rather that he and
his mynisters wilbe alwaye
ready to treade downe the
word of god vnderneth their
feet, and wyth their wycked
doctrines, stop vp the hartes
of the people that they shalbe
made vnapt to receaue it.</p>
            <p>Ther be a greate nomber
(god knoweth) that stampe
and tread downe gods word
vnderneth their feet.</p>
            <p>And very hard they be to be
knowen. Yet shall ye knowe
them by two tokens common<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
whether they be stampers
and treaders of Gods worde
vnder neth their feet or not.</p>
            <p>The one is by their talkes,
and the other is by their lyfe.</p>
            <p>As thouchynge their tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
<pb facs="tcp:15452:37"/>
they be of many sortes,
yet all tend to thys one end,
that is to say to the pullynge
down of Christ, and to the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge
vp of Anthechrist.</p>
            <p>And Amongest sundry other
of ther talkes this is one.</p>
            <p>Christ say they is not sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
but we must haue some other
bye merites, and bye satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
not meaning ciuile satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions
betwene man and
man, but satisfaction to god
the father for ther offences.</p>
            <p>And they contend playnly
that god can not saue man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
man helpe hym.</p>
            <p>And for this they brynge out
a place of Saint Austen.</p>
            <p>Whiche in deed is in his .xv.<note place="margin">de uerbis apostoli sermone xv.</note>
sermon de verbis Apostly and
these be hys wordes.</p>
            <q>
               <pb facs="tcp:15452:37"/>
Qui fecit te sine te, non saluabit te
fine te.</q>
            <p>(That is to say) he that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
the without the, shal not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
the without the.</p>
            <p>But the lyuynge almyghty
god he knoweth that holy S.
Austen myndyd no thynge
lesse, then by this or any other
sentence in his workes, to rob
be god of hys omnipotentie,
as thoughe he were not able
as well to saue man, without
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s helpe as he was hable to
make man without ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s help.</p>
            <p>But for the defence of thys
holy doctor Saynt Austen,</p>
            <p>Ther is one who hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a tragedy. <hi>De libero arbitrio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Italian tonge, and is
not translated into any other
<pb facs="tcp:15452:38"/>
thonge to my knowledge: he
is an ytalian and semeth to be
singularly well learned.</p>
            <p>He sayth that at Rome in
that worthy library (most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to be in so wycked a
place) named, <hi>Biblioteca Vaticana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their remayneth an old
written copy of Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten,
wher in thesame senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
is word by word, as I haue
rehersed it vnto yow: but in
the ende of the sentence (he
sayth) that ther is an intero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatif
poynt, that so it is not a
determinynge sentence, but
a question. Thus.</p>
            <p>Qui fecitte sine te, non saluabit te sine te?</p>
            <p>He that made the without
the, shall he not saue the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the? Oh lorde what a
change here is now in thys
<pb facs="tcp:15452:38"/>
sentence.</p>
            <p>How smal aduantage now
can our merit prechers, &amp; our
satisfactioners take of thys
doctrine? Trewly none ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
at all, for the wordes
sound now to thesittingforth
of gods omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, and they
declare that God is euen as
hable to saue man withoute
mans helpe, as he was to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
man withoute mans helpe
Saint Augusten confuteth
this opinyon of thy merites
no man more, and namely in
his workes agaynste the pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians.<note place="margin">Ambro. 1. Cor. x.</note>
And Saint Ambrose
vpon the fyrst Epistle to the
Corynthes vtterly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that opynyon of other
satisfactions besydes Christ,
saynge.</p>
            <q>
               <pb facs="tcp:15452:39"/>
               <hi>Hoc est constitutum a Deo, ut qui credit
inchristum saluus sit sine opere, sola fide,
gratis accipiens remissionem peccatorum.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>This is thapointeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of god,
that he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beleueth in Christe,
shalbe saued without work, by
faith only, frely receauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of his sinnes. So that
although our workes declare
our at tonement with almigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty
god, yet do they not make
satisfaction &amp; attonement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
god and vs. Such as
vse this talke of satisfactions
besydes Christ for ther sinnes
be sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pers &amp; treders of Christ
and his word vnder ther feet
with ther talke. Another talk
ther is, wherby ye shall know
them to be treaders doune of
gods word, which is thesame
in effect as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other was but in
words diuerse: They say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we
shal be saued &amp; iustified in the
<pb facs="tcp:15452:39"/>
sight of god by our workes, &amp;
not by faith only. &amp; here they
condemne al prechars, which
teach the doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings
Mai. homelies of saluation, &amp;
of good workes, saing wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they condempne
al good workes, which thinge
is very vntrue. For the true
prechers of goddes most holy
word, (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they take for this
point as heretiques) doo not
condempne good workes, but
they set faith in her place, and
good workes in ther place, tea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching
a diuerse office of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one,
from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other (y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is to say) that
fayth maketh a man iust in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

doth declare a man iust in the
sight of god y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> faith maketh a

a man to be a good tree.
And therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet dauid
<pb facs="tcp:15452:40"/>
lykeneth the good man to the<note place="margin">Psal. 1. a</note>
tree that is planted by the

            <p>That man sayth, he hath
fayth, and lyueth vngodly, he
sayth, vntreuly for fayth can
not be frutles, no more then
fyer with out heat.</p>
            <p>And therfor is fayth in the
scripture alwayes lykned not
to barren and frutles trees,
but to herynge, and frutfull
trees, as to the fygge tree the
olyue,<note place="margin">Ioh. xv.</note> and the vyne, whiche
exede in plentifulnes of frute
aboue other trees.</p>
            <p>In the .xxi.<note place="margin">Mat. xxi.</note> of saint Math.
gospell oure sauioure Christ
cursed the figge tree when he
found no fruyt vpon in why?
<pb facs="tcp:15452:40"/>
Not because the fygge tree
had offendid, but to geue vs
example that all suche as be
frutles trees be accursed of
God. Wherfore ye see that all
good men wyldoe good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
euen as a good tree wyll
brynge forth good fruts, they
wyl cloth the naked, feed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,

and so foorth geuynge almes
though they haue neuer a
penny in their purse, so that
when they be of habilitie, they
wyll brynge forth frute and
geue almes and doe all other
good workes accordyngly.</p>
            <p>Thys is the doctrine of the
trew preachers whom these
<pb facs="tcp:15452:41"/>
that tread doun gods woord,
&amp; hinder the goyng forward
of it with ther talke, impeache
as teachers of false, and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus
doctrine, to the intend
to make the people vnapt to
receaue the sead that is sowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>I beseche god stoppe them of
ther talke when it shalbe hys
pleasure.</p>
            <p>Another talke ther is wherby
ye shall knowe suche as tread
the sead of Gods most holy
word, vnder their feet. I can
say (say they) my pater noster,
mine Aue mary, and my creed,
and the ten commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes,
and that is enoghe for me.</p>
            <p>Let them preche and teache,
as muche as they wyll I care
for none of them all. But S.
Paule saith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye must fele a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
<pb facs="tcp:15452:41"/>
quiknes in your hartes
of your belefe, which quiknes
shal make you confesse Christe
with your mouthe when so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
tyme and occasion shal ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue,
So that it is not enoge to
say these lessons of our fayth
with out the booke, but these
lessons must procede out of a
quike fayth, without whiche,
it is impossyble to please al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God.</p>
            <p>Another talke ther is wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they tread the seed of gods
most holy worde vnder their
feet, whiche is thys. Beleue
say they as your fore fathers
hathe done before yow.</p>
            <p>And in this mynd they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
al men to stand and remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
styl styfly without searchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
any further.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15452:42"/>
To these I say that if it were
a sufficient excuse for men to
say: We beleue as our fathers
hath belefet, then had the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes,
the Turkes, and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fydelles
a sufficient excuse, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
that they beleue as ther fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
belefet before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And by this reason, if our fore
fathers denyed Christe, we
must also deny Christ: if oure
forefathers acknoweledged
the bishop of Rome, to be the
supreme head of the churche,
we must doe the lyke, and so
forth of the popishe masse, and
all such lyke trumpery, which
is to great an inconuenience
to graunte.</p>
            <p>Therfore for Christes sake
good people from henceforth,
geue no eare to such talkers,
<pb facs="tcp:15452:42"/>
as say they will doe as ther fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers
hath done before them.
Some other say, looke howe

For he that doth as most men
doeth shalbe blameles.</p>
            <p>This saynge also beynge
blowen abrode into the eares
of the people. Doth stey them
from the hearinge and recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge
of Goddes moost holy
worde. For a confutation of
this founde talke, ye shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that the great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

ignoraunt, then if we shoulde
folow most men we should fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the ignorant sort. Agayn
if the good men should folow
the most part, then should the
good men become noughte,
for the moste parte of all the

            <p>And agayne yf such me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
ther fayth grounded vpon
the multitude had been in the

not haue receauyd Christ,
for the multitude of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

            <p>But cried <hi>Crucifige, crucifige eum.</hi>
Crucyfy hym, Crucify hym.</p>
            <p>Moreouer yf suche men as

not but that they wold doe
as most men doth? What is
that? For soth worshipe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometh,
for so dothe the most

            <p>Yea and yf the matter went
by the greatnes of the number
and foloweth the multitude:
Then should the Turkes, the
<pb facs="tcp:15452:43"/>
Iewes the hethen and al infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deles
be sauid, for they be most
in number.</p>
            <p>But our Sauior Christ saith:</p>

            </q>
            <p>Many be called but few be

                  <hi>Pauci sunt qui saluabuntur.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>They be but few in number
that shalbe saued.<note place="margin">Luc. xiii.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Yesee, that this sentence is
an vn meet saynge to be in a
Christian mans mouth.</p>
            <p>Wherfor for Christes sake
let vs both shune it our selues,
and aduertise and counsell all
other to take head, that they
vse it not. Another sayng and
talke they haue whereby
they occupy the eares, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
the hartes of the people,
<pb facs="tcp:15452:44"/>
and make them vnapte to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seed of goddes word,
by meanes whereof the good
seed is loste, troden, and caste
awaye: and that is thys.</p>
            <p>I beleue saye they as the
Churche beleueth, then aske
them, howe the churche bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth?
&amp; they say as I beleue,
and so they teache all men to
make answere, as it were in a
circule. Truely this answere
might peraduenture be borne
and alowed, if they meant by
this word churche, none but
the chosen flock of Christ.</p>
            <p>Which church in dede can
not erre. But they meane the
church of Rome, by this word
churche, though they pretend
otherwise.</p>
            <p>Notwythstandynge for
<pb facs="tcp:15452:44"/>
the confutacion of there tread
worde talke, I will vse there
generall diuision of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
whyche is thys. They
deuide the churche into the
Greke, and into the Latyn
churche.</p>
            <p>Nowe if I can proue, that
bothe these members of the
church haue erred, then haue
I proued, that suche as saye
they will beleue as the church
beleueth (meaninge eyther
the greke, or the latinchurch)
may be deceaued.</p>
            <p>Fyrste then touchynge
the Greke churche, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeste,
that it dyd erre in sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge,
that the holy ghost pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaded
from the father onely,
and not from the father, and
<pb facs="tcp:15452:45"/>
the sonne,<note place="margin">Libro. l. dist. xi.</note> as it apperyth by
the maister of the sentence, &amp;
bysundry places, in Basill, and
Nazianzen, and especially by
the creed which was made in
the Nicen counsell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
these wordes be.</p>
            <gap reason="foreign">
               <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
            </gap>
            <p>And I beleue in the holye
ghoste, the lord and geuer of
lyfe, whiche procedeth from
the father.</p>
            <p>This opinion is vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned,
and Nicen Creede
is amended with an addicion,
that the holy ghost procedeth
from the father, &amp; the sonne.
So that it can not be denied,
but that the Greeke churche
was in a manyfeste error in
<pb facs="tcp:15452:45"/>
thys poynt.</p>
            <p>Now as touchyng the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn
church, whosoeuer sayth
that it can not erre, lett hym
consider well the scriptures,
which geue iustly and truelye
vnto the kinges Maiesty hys
tytle of the supreme hed of the
church: and he shall perceaue,
that he is both an heretyque,
and a traytor.</p>
            <p>And that may be proued by
two reasons, which be of such
strenght, that they can not be
auoyded, And this kinde of
reasoninge the Logicians call
Syllogismus, it was my
chance to vse them ones in a
lyke argumente at Paules
crosse. The fyrste of them is
thys.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15452:46"/>
Who soeuer concluded that
the kynges mayestye is not
supreme hed of the churche he
is a traytor: but whosoeuer
saith the latine church can not
erre concludeth that the kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
mageste is not supreme
hed of the churche. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whosoeuer sayth that the
latyn churcche can not erre he
is a traytor.</p>
            <p>And agayne: Whosoeuer
concludeth the bushop of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
to be supreme hed of the
churche he is an heritique,
but whosoeuer sayth that the
latyn church can not erre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
that the bushop of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
is supreme hed of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,
<hi>Ergo.</hi> Whosoeuer sait that
the latyn churche can not erre
is an heretique.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15452:46"/>
The partes of thys Sylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme
be so trew, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentes
doth folow, insuche
a dialecticall forme that al the
Sophistry in christendom can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not

            <p>Then good Christian au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,

            <p>Your fayth must not be

Yet is necessary for euery
