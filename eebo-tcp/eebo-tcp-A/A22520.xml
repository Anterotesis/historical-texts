         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas Our late Royall Father of happy Memorie deceased,</hi> Hauing vnderstood by the generall complaints of his louing sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects from the seuerall parts of His Realme of <hi>England,</hi> that of late yeeres theretofore, the Woolles of this Kingdome were excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly fallen from their wonted values, and that the Cloth and Stuffe of the same had not that vent in forreigne parts, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they had, and taking into his Princely consideration the weighty consequence thereof, as of a matter of very great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for the wealth and welfare of this Kingdom, also being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to prouide a speedy and effectuall remedie against such a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euill, did by aduice of his Priuy Councell, and after informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and report made by diuers persons of qualitie, and knowen abilitie trusted in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, finde amongst other things of moment, That the exportation of Woolles, Wool-fels, woollen Yarne, Fullers earth, and Woad-ashes, were a great means to enable the forreigne making of cloth, and a principall impediment to the vent of our clothes made in <hi>England:</hi> And that the false and deceitfull making, dying, and dressing of our cloth and stuffes here made of Woolles, did exceedingly disgrace, and discredite the Draperie of this our Kingdome, and did very much hinder the vent of those Commodities. Therupon Our said late Father, did by his royall Proclamation, bearing date the twentieth day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> in the twentieth yeere of his reigne ouer <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> straightly charge and command, that no manner of Woolles, Wool-fels, Woollen Yarne, Cornish haire, Fullers earth, or Woad-ashes, should be at any time or times, thereafter exported out of this Realme of <hi>England,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> Towne, or Port of <hi>Berwicke,</hi> or any the Isles, Ports, Creekes, or places thereof, into any forreigne parts, or into the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland:</hi> nor that any of the sayd Commodities should be transported out of our Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> into any other parts, then into the
<pb facs="tcp:28636:2"/>
Realme of <hi>England</hi> onely vpon such paines as in the sayd Proclamation are contained. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the sayd Proclamation was by Our Fathers decease determined: And yet Wee finde that the reasons and necessitie doe still remaine.</p>
            <p>Wee therefore, out of the great desire We haue to aduance the wealth of Our people, and by all meanes possible to cherish and comfort their labours, haue thought fit by the aduice of Our priuie Councell to renew the said Proclamation, with further prohibition of the expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Hydes both tand, and rawe, by reason of the exportation whereof, as Wee are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, diuers the like abuses and inconueniences haue, and doe dayly happen.</p>
            <p>Wherefore Our will and pleasure is, and We doe by these presents straightly charge and command, that no manner of Woolles, Wool-fels, Woollen yarne, Cornish haire, Fullers earth, Woad-ashes, or Hydes either raw, or tand, be at any time, or times hereafter expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of this Our Realme of <hi>England,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> Towne, or Port of <hi>Berwicke,</hi> or any the Isles, Ports, Creekes, or places thereof, into any forreigne parts, or into Our Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor that any manner of Woolles, Wool-fels, Woollen yarne, Cornish haire, Fullers earth, Woad-ashes, or Hydes, either raw or tand, be transported out of Our Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> into any other parts, then into the Realme of <hi>England</hi> onely: vpon paine of confiscation of all such Woolles and other the Premisses so transported, or endeauoured to be transported, as also of Our highest indignation, and the seuerest censure of Our Court of Starre-chamber, and of such other paines and penalties as by the Lawes, and Statutes of this Our Kingdome, and by Our Prerogatiue Royall may be inflicted.</p>
            <p>And to the end that all Officers and Ministers in, or about Our Ports of <hi>England</hi> may the more strictly looke to the obseruance of this Our will and pleasure, for the Weale of this Our Kingdome: We doe further straightly charge and command, that if any Officer, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, of, or belonging to Our Customes, or Ports, or attending at any the Hauens, Creeks, or places adiacent, or carrying to the sea, shall consent or conniue at the vnlawfull exportation of the Premisses, or any of them; or if any of them, shall make any certificate vpon any Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, of the landing of any Wools in any ports of this Our R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alme, vnlesse the Officer himself, who shal make such certificate, doe first see the same Wools landed, according to the contents of the said certificate: Or if the said Officers, or any of them shal make any Cocket, which shall not containe the number of Sackes, and the weight of the Wooll in euery Sacke, contained in such Cocket, that then euery such Officer, and Minister who shall offend in any the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, shall not onely forfeit his Office, place, and imployment, but shall also incurre all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the paines and penalties aforesaid. And if any Minister or Officer of, or in any Ship, or other Uessell, shall permit, and suffer any Woolles, Wool-fels, or any other of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses to be transported in any Ship, Bottome, or other Uessell, wherein or whereof he shall be a Master, or other officer: That then euery person so offending shall be subiect to such paine and penaltie as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>And in case there be now in force any former Licences or Authorities heretofore giuen and granted by Us, or any of Our Predecessors for transportation of Wools, or any other the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, We doe hereby reuoke and disanull the same. And are resolued that none such hereafter shall be granted.</p>
            <p>And for the better vtterance of Cloth within this Our Kingdome; Wee doe straitly charge and command, that when, and as often as vpon the occasion of any Burials, or Funerals, any Blackes be hereafter giuen or worne; That then such Blacks and mourning stuffes shall bee onely of Cloth and Stuffes, made of the Wool of this Kingdome, and not elsewhere, nor otherwise.</p>
            <p>And for that We are informed, that the false Dying of Cloth and Stuffes made of Wools, is a great hinderance to the vent of those commodities. Therefore Wee straitly will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, That no person whatsoeuer, in, or towards the Dying of any Cloth of what sort soeuer, or of any Stuffes made of Wool, shal vse any Logwood or Blockwood the vse whereof about the said Clothes or Stuffes, hath so often by seueral Lawes and Proclamations beene already condemned.</p>
            <p>And for the better discouery of false and deceiueable Dying, and the suppressing of the said Logwood and Blockwood, in and about the Dying of Stuffes made of Wool; We doe strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charge and command the Wardens of the Dyers of <hi>London,</hi> within the compasse of their
<pb facs="tcp:28636:3"/>
Search, and all other Officers in other places; That from time to time they make carefull and diligent Search for the discouerie of all false and deceitfull Dying, and if in their Searches they shall finde any Cloth or Stuffe Dyed with Logwood or Blockwood, either in all, or in part, That they seaze the same, and informe Our Attourney Generall for the time being thereof, that such proceeding may be speedily had against the Offendors, as so great a contempt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth.</p>
            <p>Further Wee doe hereby straightly charge and command all Iustices of Peace, Mayors, Sheriffes, Bayliffes, Officers, and other persons whatsoeuer, to doe their best endeauours to discouer all and euery the Offendors against this Our Proclamation.</p>
            <p>And for the better encouragement of all such as shall take care and paines to make such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coueries, Our will and pleasure is, that euery such person that shall bee the first discouerer of such Offendor, shall be rewarded with the moity, or one halfe of such summes of money as shal come vnto Us by vertue of any forfeiture incurred vpon this Our Proclamation: Giuing also like Charge and Command that all persons of what degree, qualitie or place soeuer, to whom it shall appertaine, doe diligently obserue, and readily assist the due performance of this Our Proclamation in all things.</p>
