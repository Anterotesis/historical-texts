            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE here preſent you with a Medal of an <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Author,</hi> which moſt properly belongs to you; (he being at this time hired to Lye and Libel in your ſervice) and in his laſt Eſſay, has perform'd it ſo dully, that if you put him away (as it is ſaid of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-Uſher</hi> and the Doctor in the <hi>Rehearſal</hi>) No body elſe will take him; No, No body elſe will take him. We cannot ſay his Portraicture is done at the full length, or has all its Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſince there are many touches to be added to it, which we ſhall reſerve for the occaſions he ſhall give us hereafter. But we dare ſay, theſe rough ſtrokes have made the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and proportions ſo true, that any one that knows him, will find there is a great reſemblance of him; and will believe that he has ſate above five times for it. Though indeed he is ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral of ſhewing himſelf, that in an hours ſpace, he will expoſe all his Parts; and a good Drawer, in that time, may obſerve enough to make a <note n="*" place="margin">So the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters call a naked Picture.</note> 
               <hi>Nuditie</hi> of him.</p>
            <p>You may know he is no concealer of himſelf, by a ſtory which he tells of himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> That (when he came firſt to Town) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a young <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>midable Cripple.</hi> The unpuniſh'd audaciouſneſs of this front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Scribler, would be a reproach to any Government; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man can think him too hardly dealt with in the following <hi>Medal:</hi> eſpecially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince he knows, and ſo do all his old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that there is not an untrue word ſpoken of him.</p>
            <p>There is not ſo vile an employment, as that of a Hired Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, an Executioner of mens Reputations: the Hangman is an Office of greater Dignity. Were all which your Poet ſays of this great Peer true, yet the Libeller ought to be whipt out of a Countrey for his Inſolence: but what does he deſerve, when he himſelf knows every word of it to be falſe! and ſcarce a Papiſt in <hi>England</hi> believes any thing of it to be true.</p>
            <p>He is as unlucky in his alluſion to the Turks wearing of <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begs</hi> Bones, as he is afterwards in his bungling Simile, about the feign'd Aſſociation. They were the Turks, <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> Enemies, that wore his Bones; and therefore he thinks this Lords Friends muſt do the ſame.</p>
            <p>According to the example which he cites you, <hi>Tories</hi> ſhould do it and I doubt not but ye would be glad on't; but we hope he will laſt, till by a happy Agreement of the King with a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, your Party will hide their heads, or become of no ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which for that very reaſon ye endeavour all ye can to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>I know not what good his Bones might do ye, were he dead; but I am ſure his Brains, while he is living, would be very much to the advantage of the beſt of ye: thoſe would keep ye from the ridiculous Follies and mad Extravagancies ye daily run into.</p>
            <p>'Tis you that are apparently the Faction; ſince ye are the Few that have divided from the Many. 'Tis you who in your Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Clubs vilifie the Government, by audaciouſly railing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Parliaments,</hi> ſo great and ſo eſſential a part of it. They ought to loſe the uſe of Speech, who dare ſay any thing irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently of the <hi>King,</hi> or diſreſpectfully of <hi>Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61815:3"/>If any thing could make the <hi>King</hi> loſe the love and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his people, it would be your unpuniſh'd boldneſs, who preſume to call the <hi>Freeholders</hi> of <hi>England</hi> the Rabble, and their <hi>Repreſentative</hi> a Crowd, and ſtrike at the very Root of all their Liberty. Ye are thoſe who abuſe our gracious Prince, and endeavour to delude him with falſe Numbers, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſerve him when ye have no Intereſt, as in all the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Parliaments</hi> (his <hi>Majeſty</hi> has been pleaſed to promiſe us) will plainly appear.</p>
            <p>If any thing could diſhonour him, it would be the bloudy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of your Spirits; your unpuniſhed Exorbitances, and breach of Laws; your Huzzaing, Roaring, Quarrelling, and Damning by much the greater part of the Nation, and their whole Repreſentative Body. Who made ye Judges in <hi>Iſrael?</hi> but whatever ye might have been in <hi>Judea,</hi> ye will find very few of ye will be made, in <hi>England,</hi> Truſtees for the Liberty of the people, as your Poet ſays, who (as if he had been hired for the whole Popiſh Plot) vilely caſts dirt upon the beſt reformed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in his next Page,</p>

Nor was this Calumny ſo much faſtened by them upon <hi>Beza,</hi> as upon the Admiral <hi>Coligni,</hi> who was known to be a man of more Vertue and Honour, than to allow the leaſt acceſſion to ſo baſe a Crime. Had this vile Libeller but common honeſty and ingenuity, he would (at the ſame time he preſumes to revive this calumnious Accuſation) have taken notice of the vindication which the Admiral publiſhed to juſtifie his innocency.

            <p>And for <hi>Buchanan,</hi> the character which Archbiſhop <hi>Spotſwood</hi> has given of him, is enough to ſecure and preſerve his memory from the ſtains which ſuch Fellows as this, or any Enemies to truth
<pb facs="tcp:61815:4"/>
and Learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could throw upon him. Nor will <hi>Calvin</hi> loſe the reverence he has from good Proteſtants, for this Libeller's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Reproaches.</p>
            <p>For the Aſſociation, which he next mentions, dropt out of the Clouds, entred into, and ſubſcribed by no body, and ſeen by no one of our Party that ever we could hear of, (and we believe, by none of yours, but thoſe that contrived the putting it into the Earls Cloſet) it renders you more ridiculous and extravagant than ever ye were; to ſet up an Abhorrence through all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> of a Paper, which you can lay to the charge of no Party, nor at one ſingle mans door.</p>
            <p>But we doubt not but if you had found or put the Libel your Poet was Cudgell'd for (though few of your Loyal Cloſets, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, are without that, and other Libels upon the King) into the Earls Cloſet, ye would have ſet up an abhorrence of that, rather than not have kept up the Fermentation and Diviſion amongst the people. When this is run out of breath, we ſuppoſe ye will ſet up the Ticket for the Forbidden Dinner, and ye will abhor Factious, Schiſmatical, Seditious, Fanatical, and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Dining, or ſome new Red-Herring out of his Lordſhips Kitchin will come forth.</p>
            <p>The inſolence in the ſame page of your Libeller, in comparing the Jury (that gave in <hi>Ignoramus</hi> to the Bill against our Noble Peer) to a Jury taken out of <hi>Newgate,</hi> deſerves the Pillory, ſince 'tis evident to the whole City, they were all men of ſingular Honeſty and Integrity in all their dealings, of ſignal good Lives, of good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings, and of great Wealth; and, in the Memory of man, the City has not ſeen a Jury bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter qualified; nor was there one Diſſenter amongst them, to prevent your weak Cavils; Cavils, I ſay; for it had been no Objection if they had been all ſo, ſince they value their Oaths and Conſciences as much as any ſort of men and have no Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations to go against them.</p>
            <p>And this Clamour against the Jury, is becauſe they would not believe an incredible matter from incredible Witneſſes, who either were then, or had been lately, moſt of them <hi>Papiſts;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61815:4"/>
who were ſo inconſiſtent in their Teſtimony with one another an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> themſelves, that I am confident not one of the reverend Benc believed them: if they did, they must be very ſhallow, and muſt take this Lord to be little better than an Ideot. If ye look upon the Oath of a Grand Jury-man, ye will find that the meaning of thoſe two words <hi>Billa Vera</hi> is, they do believe the matter of the Bill in their Conſciences to be true; which if they did not, they muſt have been perjur'd if they found, the Bill. The Law provides, that in capital Caſes, a man ſhall not be wrongfully accuſed, and therefore appoints two Juries, both which are bound to find according to their belief; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice is as great, though the injury be leſs, for the former to accuſe by Indictment, if they believe the party innocent, as for the latter to hang him with the ſame belief.</p>
            <p>If ye had had the diſpoſal of the Juries, we doubt not but there are Conſpirators would have found Witneſſes to have ſworn that most of the Nobility and Gentry who have been zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and active againſt Popery, had entred into this feigned Aſſociation. Heaven keep us from Juries, ſuch as will give 800 l. dammages to a Powder-monkey, without any Dammage proved, (for words ſpoken by a Magiſtrate in rebuking the ſawcy Fellow) as if it were <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> to abuſe a Tory, though a ſeller of Waſh-balls: And from that which gave 1000 l. to a Knight for being called Papist, whom it would not, perhaps, have cost 100 l. if he had been convicted: Or 500 l. to a notorious Varlet, for being ſix hours detained by a Meſſenger, (after notice of the Diſſolution of a Parliament) and perhaps no legal notice neither. Our Juries are zealous to preſerve the Innocent, and yours to ruine and deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>Ye ſee what manner of Spirit it is that actuates ye; and by the Fruits we can gueſs whether it be good or evil: it ſeems to us to breath forth nothing but Ruine, Murther, and Maſſacre. And, for your underſtanding, 'tis ſufficiently ſhewn, by your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to believe a Proteſtant Plot (to Seize and Depoſe the King, and deſtroy the Government) without any other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance proved, than that of a Joyner riding with Sword and
<pb facs="tcp:61815:5"/>
Piſtols to <hi>Oxford,</hi> who had uſed to ride ſo armed many years before; and yet ye have the face to deny a Popiſh Plot, (for the deſtruction of the Kings Perſon and Government) after <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters, and the others publiſhed by the Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (by command from the Houſe of Commons); the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> the Aſſaſſination of Mr. <hi>Arnold:</hi> After a general Report among the Jeſuites in all forein Popiſh Countries, of the Kings being dead (it ſeems they thought themſelves cock-ſure) at the time Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears he was to be murther'd here; and a multitude of other convincing Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which were of that force, that there were at leaſt ten of the Kings Proclamations that affirmed it, a publick Faſt was enjoyned for it, and three ſucceſſive Parliaments, <hi>nemine contradicente,</hi> upon a full hearing of the Evidence, reading all the Letters, and weighing all the Circumſtances, declared it to be a horrid Conſpiracy against the Kings Life and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment What impudence or ſtupidity is this, let the world judge!</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Tories,</hi> fare ye well; apply your heads to thinking a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and do not, like young Whelps, run away with a falſe Scent, and cry out <hi>Forty One</hi> and <hi>Ignoramus;</hi> and in time ye may be wiſer; and let your Poet know, that the first occaſion he gives, he ſhall hear from us farther.</p>
