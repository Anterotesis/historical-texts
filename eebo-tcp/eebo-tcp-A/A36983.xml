            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>OLd Plays like Mistresses, long since enjoy'd,</l>
               <l>Long after please, whom they before had cloy'd;</l>
               <l>For Fancy chews the Cudd on past delight,</l>
               <l>And cheats it self to a new Appetite.</l>
               <l>But then this second Fit comes not so strong,</l>
               <l>Like second Agues, neither fierce nor long:</l>
               <l>What you have known before, grows sooner stale,</l>
               <l>And less provokes you, than an untold Tale.</l>
               <l>That but refreshes what before you knew,</l>
               <l>But this discovers something that is new;</l>
               <l>Hence 'tis, that at new Plays you come so soon,</l>
               <l>Like Bride-grooms, hot to go to Bed ere noon!</l>
               <l>Or, if you are detain'd some little space,</l>
               <l>The stinking Footman's sent to keep your place.</l>
               <l>But, when a Play's reviv'd, you stay and dine,</l>
               <l>And drink till three, and then come dropping in;</l>
               <l>As Husband after absence, wait all day,</l>
               <l>And decently for Spouse, till Bed-time stay!</l>
               <l>So, ere the Brethren's liberal Fit was spent,</l>
               <l>The first wise <hi>Nonconformist,</hi> underwent</l>
               <l>With ease, and batten'd in Imprisonment.</l>
               <l>For greater gains, his zeal refus'd the less;</l>
               <l>Each day to him was worth a Diocess.</l>
               <l>But he who now, in hopes of equal gain,</l>
               <l>Will needs be Pris'ner, tryes the Trick in vain;</l>
               <l>He melts in durance half his Grease away,</l>
               <l>To get, like us, poor twenty Pounds a day.</l>

                     <p>UPon my Honour, Sir, I have observ'd him in <hi>Britain;</hi> he was then of a declining fame, and not expected to reap the additional Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Fortune has since bless'd him with: I could have look'd on him then, without the help of admiration, tho' the Catalogue of his Endowments had been tabl'd by his side, and I to peruse him by Items.</p>

                     <p>You speak of him when he was much less accomplish'd than now he is. Consider, Sir, he was young, he was young.</p>

                     <p>This business of marrying his King's Daughter, wherein he must be weigh'd by her youth and weakness, rather than his own value, ecchoes him, I doubt not, a great deal above his true worth.</p>

                     <p>I, and the approbation of those that weep. This lamentable Divorce to comply with her, seem wonderfully to extend him: But I shall shortly be better inform'd; for I design a speedy Journey to <hi>Britain,</hi> where perhaps I may spend the best part of this Summer.</p>

                     <p>Sir, You o're-rate my poor kindness; I was glad I did attone my Countreyman and you; it had been pity you should have been put together,

                     <speaker>Ursa.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, I was then but a young Traveller, and rather desir'd to be silent in what I heard, than to be guided by others Experiences; but upon my riper judgement, (if I offend not to say it is riper) my Quarrel was not altogether slight.</p>

                     <p>Safely I think: 'Twas a Contention in publick about the praise of our Countrey-Mistresses; this Gentleman at that time vouching, and upon warrant of bloud affirmation, his to be more fair, vertuous, wise, chast, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, qualifi'd, and less contemptible, than any the rarest of our <hi>Spanish</hi> Ladies.</p>

                     <p>Methinks as fair, and as good, a kind of hand in hand Comparison were somewhat too good for any Lady in <hi>Britany;</hi> for as that Diamond of yours there outshines some I have seen, so perhaps may she; but I have not seen the most precious Diamond that is, nor you the Lady Sir.</p>
