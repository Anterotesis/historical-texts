            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Reverend Brother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE time of Lent now approaching, which has been anciently and very Christianly set apart, for penitential humiliation of Soul and Body, for Fasting and Weeping and Praying, all which you know are very frequently inculcated in Holy Scripture, as the most effectual means we can use, to avert those Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments our sins have deserv'd; I thought it most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that Character which, unworthy as I am, I su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain, to <hi>call you</hi> and all my Brethren of the Clergy to <hi>mourning;</hi> to <hi>mourning</hi> for your own sins, and to <hi>mourning</hi> for the sins of the Nation.</p>
            <p>In making such an address to you as this, I follow the example of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that blessed Bishop and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, who from his retirement wrote an excellent Epistle <note place="margin">Ep. 11. Edit. <hi>Oxon.</hi>
               </note> to his Clergy, most worthy of your serious perusal, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them, by publick Prayers and Tears to appease the Anger of God, which they then actually felt, and which we may justly fear.</p>
            <p>Remember that to keep such a <hi>Fast as God has chosen,</hi> it is not enough for you to <hi>afflict your own soul,</hi> but you must also according to your ability, <hi>deal your bread to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Isa. 58. 5, 7.</note> 
               <hi>the Hungry:</hi> and the rather, because we have not onely
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49978:3"/>
Usual objects of Charity to relieve, but many poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Strangers are now fled hither for Sanctuary, whom as Brethren, as members of Christ, we should <hi>take in</hi> and Cherish.</p>
            <p>That you may perform the office of a publick Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour the more assiduously, I beg of you to say daily in your Closet, or in your Family, or rather in both, all this time of Abstinence, the 51<hi>st.</hi> Psalm, and the other Prayers which follow it in the Commination. I could wish also that you would frequently read and meditate on the Lamentations of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> which Holy <hi>Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi> was wont to doe, and the reading of which melted <note place="margin">Orat. 12.</note> him into the like Lamentations, as affected the Prophet himself when he Pen'd them.</p>
            <p>But your greatest Zeal must be spent for the Publick Prayers, in the constant devout use of which, the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Safety both of Church and State is highly concern'd: be sure then to offer up to God every day the Morning and Evening Prayer; offer it up in your Family at least, or rather as far as your circumstances may possibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, offer it up in the Church, especially if you live in a great Town, and say over the Litany every Morning during the whole Lent. This I might <hi>enjoyn you</hi> to doe, on your Canonical Obedience, <hi>but for Love's sake I rather beseech you,</hi> and I cannot recommend to you a more devout and comprehensive Form, of penitent and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Intercesson than that, or more proper for the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49978:3"/>
Be not discourag'd if but few come to the <hi>Solemn Assemblies,</hi> but go to the <hi>House of Prayer,</hi> where <hi>God is well known for a sure Refuge:</hi> Go, though you go alone, or but with one besides your self; and there as you are God's <hi>Remembrancer, keep not silence, and give Him no</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Isa. 62. 6.</note> 
               <hi>rest, till He establish, till He make Ierusalem a praise in the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first sacred <hi>Council of Nice,</hi> for which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world has always had a great and just veneration, ordains a <hi>Provincial Synod to be held before Lent, that all</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Can. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Dissensions being taken away a pure oblation might be offer'd up to God,</hi> namely of Prayers and Fasting and Alms, and Tears, which might produce a comfortable Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at the following Easter: and that in this Diocese, we may in some degree imitate so Primitive a practice, I exhort you to endeavour all you can, to reconcile differences, to reduce those that go astray, to promote universal Charity towards all that dissent from you, and <hi>to put on as the Elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Col. 3. 12.</note> 
               <hi>of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering, forbearing one another and forgiving one another, even as Christ forgave you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I passionately beseech you to reade over daily your Ordination Vows, to examine your self how you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them; and in the Prayers that are in that Office, fervently to importune God for the assistance of His good Spirit, that you may conscientiously perform them.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49978:4"/>
               <hi>Teach publickly, and from house to house, and warn every one night and day with Tears; warn</hi> them to repent, to fast and to pray, and to give Alms, <hi>and to bring forth fruits meet for repentance; warn</hi> them to continue stedfast in that <hi>faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> in which they were baptiz'd, <hi>to keep the word of God's Patience, that God may keep them in the hour of Temptation; warn</hi> them against the sins and the errours of the age; <hi>warn</hi> them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate publick judgments, and to mourn for publick provocations.</p>
            <p>No one can reade God's holy Word but he will see, that the greatest Saints have been the greatest Mourners: David <hi>wept whole Rivers;</hi> Jeremy <hi>wept sore, and his Eyes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 136. Ier. 9. 1.—13. 17. Dan. 9. 3.—10. 2.—</note> 
               <hi>ran down in secret places day and night like a Fountain;</hi> Daniel <hi>mourned three full weeks, and did eat no pleasant bread, and sought God by prayer and supplications, with fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and sackcloth and ashes; St.</hi> Paul <hi>was humbled and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 21.—3 Phil. 18.—</note> 
               <hi>bewailed and wept</hi> for the sins of others; and our Lord himself when He <hi>beheld the City wept over it.</hi> Learn then <note place="margin">Luke 19. 41—</note> of these great Saints, learn of our most compassionate Saviour, to weep for the publick, and weeping to pray, that <hi>we may know in this our day, the things that belong to our peace, lest they be hid from our eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To mourn for National Guilt, in which all share, is a duty incumbent on all, but especially on Priests, who are particularly commanded <hi>to weep and to say, Spare Thy people, O Lord, and give not Thine Heritage to reproach,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioel 2. 17.</note> 
               <hi>that God may repent of the evil, and become jealous for His Land, and pity His people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49978:4"/>
Be assur'd that none are more tenderly regarded by God than such Mourners as these; there <hi>is a mark</hi> set by <note place="margin">Ezek. 9. 4.</note> Him on <hi>all that sigh and cry for the abominations of the Land,</hi> the destroying Angel is forbid to <hi>hurt any of them,</hi> they are all God's peculiar care, and shall all have either present deliverance, or such supports and consolations, as shall abundantly endear their Calamity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the God of all Grace, who hath called you unto His eternal Glory by Christ Iesus, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you</hi> in the true Catholick and Apostolick Faith profess'd in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and enable you to adorn that Apostolick Faith with an Apostolick Example and Zeal, and give all our whole Church that timely repentance, those broken and contrite hearts, that both Priests and People may all plentifully <hi>sow in Tears,</hi> and in God's good time may all plentifully <hi>reap in Ioy.</hi>
