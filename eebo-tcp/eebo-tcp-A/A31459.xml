            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

unto us, that we have in all times, both of proſperity and adverſity men emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently gratious, who have gone before us through the wilderneſs of this world to glory. For as young Scollars are edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in learning by ſeeing Rules veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Examples; ſo are Chriſtians built up in their faith and obedience, by perceiving the conſcienciouſneſs and confidence of others in their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

In his whole converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both perſonal and relative, he held forth much ſweetneſs, with meekneſs of wiſdom, and the power of godlineſs. Notwithſtanding the variety of changes with which he was exerciſed, in regard of the Times, and manifold Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he was ſtill ſteady in his courſe, walking with God, and by faith ſeeing him who is viſible.

               <hi>THOMAS CAWTON,</hi> Late Miniſter of the Goſpel at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>THomas Cawton</hi> was born at <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in <hi>Norfolk</hi> in the year 1605. of honeſt Parents, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe tuition and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation he remained, til the immature part of his life was ſomething ripened, and made capable of being improved for higher deſigns than thoſe of his Infancy. The grain of his nature from a child lay towards the Miniſtry, to which he had ſo ſtrong an inclination, that nothing could unbyas or divert the current of his affections from an eager deſire of following that imployment.</p>
            <p>His Parents ſeeing him indued with ſo good a principle, were very ſolicitous how to bring him up in learning, but being much
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104265:6"/>
diſcouraged by the ſmalneſs of their eſtate, want of friends and counſel, how to manage their affairs moſt for his good: they were in ſuſpence, having their eyes towards God, whoſe good hand of divine providence fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring their intended enterpriſe, ſtirred up friends above expectation, and particularly procured the Patronage of Sir <hi>Robert Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end,</hi> a Knight of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> eminent for parts and piety, whoſe rare endowments both for Religion and Learning, as they did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his Perſon, ſo they ſounded forth his praiſe in that County. This munificent <hi>Moecenas</hi> having encouraged his Parents by his bounty, he was ſent to the Trivial School to be inſtructed in ſuch kind of literature as might fit him for the Univerſity: during which time, I cannot but note the ſweet carriage and condeſcention of his worthy <hi>Moecenas,</hi> who would call him up into his own chamber and pray with him, and often give him Verſes to make, and correct them himſelf. When he came a little to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand himſelf and the uſe of Learning, he was ſo unwearied in the further purſuit of it, that to out-ſtrip others, he did conſtantly riſe very early ſummer and winter; inſomuch that (though he had a great way to go to School) yet he would be there before his Maſter was ſtirring, and had admittance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Maſters chamber, where he did every morning conſtrue a Chapter in the Greek

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104265:8"/>
yet he was ſo modeſt as to preferr every one before himſelf, and to ſlight his own excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; he was, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>To inſtance in particulars, he being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a deep judgment, made a famous Logician, and would handle an Argument with extraordinary dexterity: for the Arts and Sciences he was well skilled in them too, eſpecially in thoſe of them that concern a Divine.</p>
            <p>He was an incomparable Linguiſt, for the Oriental tongues; few in thoſe times (none almoſt) of his ſtanding went beyond him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he took much delight in the <hi>Chaldee, Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick,</hi> and to gain more and more skill in them, got acquaintance with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Wheelock,</hi> then <hi>Arabick</hi> Profeſſor: but his greateſt and chiefeſt endeavours were ſpent upon the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> in the ſtudy of which (as the moſt profitable) he quickly conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the difficulties of the tongue, and was Maſter of it, inſomuch that he was a great help to others: for that was his manner
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104265:8"/>
when he intended to be excellent at any thing, he taught others what he himſelf had learned, thinking it the beſt way to get learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give learning: he was even in his Youth apt to teach; and I may ſay, to my knowledge, that many eminent in God's Church at this day owe all the Hebrew they have to his inſtructions.</p>
            <p>He learned and underſtood the <hi>Saxon,</hi> high and low <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Italian, Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> tongues perfectly, and read many Books in them all, after he left the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
            <p>And it is worth the taking notice, that he got the skill he had in languages moſt by his own induſtry, having little or no aſſiſtance or encouragement but his love to tongues, which put him upon turning every ſtone, and uſing every means needfull and fit to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his end, which labour of his was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly crowned with ſucceſs, and he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Maſter made Maſter of the tongues, which to his dying day he kept bored to his mind as perpetual ſervants to be ſubſervient to their Miſtreſs Divinity.</p>
            <p>As his profound reaſoning ſhewed the depth of his judgment, ſo his readineſs in langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in underſtanding ſo many, and that ſo well as he did, does evince and evidence the ſtrength of his memory; judgment and memory ſeldom meet together in one and the ſame perſon, but in him they kiſſed and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104265:9"/>
embraced each other, and with a ſiſterly complyance dwelt together in unity, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, and both conſpiring to make him throughly furniſhed to every good word and work.</p>
            <p>But that that made his parts ſo eminent was his eminent piety, his holy, ſtrict, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe converſation; he never thought much of doing or ſuffering much for God: he was a noted Profeſſor both in the Town and Colledge, and went through much oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though but a young Diſciple; yet he was truly conformed to his Maſter in indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the contradictions of ſinners; as adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity was his Univerſity to teach him more of God, ſo the Univerſity was his adverſity for teaching the waies of God: for he was an early Champion for Holineſs, and could better bear the reproaches of men for his holineſs, than the wrath of God for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſs, behaving himſelf ſo that none could ſpeak truly and reproachfully of him at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>He was naturally inclined to ſolitude, and having through deſire ſeparated himſelf, he intermedled with all wiſdom, he loved to withdraw and retire from the world, giving himſelf much to meditation and prayer, thinking he had ſtudied well when he had prayed well: in this ſolitude he entertained his Saviour, and by his refreſhing ſociety was more and more in love with his ſolitary

as I may ſay) ſociety; he could ſay with <hi>Cyprian, Solus non eſt cui Chriſtus comes eſt,</hi> he wants no company that hath Chriſt for his Companion: and indeed though ſolitude <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſociety he converſed with was of thoſe that were painful and pious, he kept no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with bad company, ſuch as loved God were his friends, ſuch as would come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pray, and confer about religion, and ſtrengthen one anothers hands againſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs and ungodlineſs, ſuch were his delight, and with ſuch he would be very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and open-hearted; If there be a <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah</hi> under Heaven it is evill ſociety, this (as one ſays) will bind us, betray us, blind us and undo us: but the Lord being merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him preſerved him blamleſs and ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the midſt of a wicked generaton of Schollars, his righteous ſoul being vexed for the unlawfull deeds of thoſe amongſt which he dwelt. The ſtream of example was never ſtrong enough to make him ſtirr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it, when a gale of cuſtom would carry others with full ſails to the port of endleſs and eaſleſs miſery: <hi>alienis perimus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplis,</hi> we moſtly borrow our own ruine, and

            <p>As he was carefull of himſelf leſt he ſhould at any time fall into bad company, ſo he was very deſirous and laborious to keep others out of it, and reclaim thoſe that were inveigled in it. Particular and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall notice was taken of one thing for which he was eminent and exemplary, which was this, that when any young youths came to the Univerſity either from his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or elſe where, ſuch as he knew, or was informed were well educated under godly Parents, or a godly Miniſtry, he would be ſure to get acquaintance with them at their firſt coming to the Univerſity, before they were ingaged, intangled, or infected with bad company, and would bring them into the ſociety of ſome pious Schollars of which he himſelf was: he was ſo pious as to lead them from the ſnare, and ſo prudent as to take them at their firſt coming, ſhewing them the danger before they fell into it,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104265:10"/>
and thereby diſingaging them from the company and acquaintance of vain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Schollars, of which that Colledge was then full, and who were as ſo many Factors for the Devil, venting the wares which that grand Malefactor had to ſell to young Schollars: ſeverall there were in the Colledge at that time who drew away new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Students from their books and ſtudies to their ungodly company and ſo made them debauched like themſelves, they were not content to go to Hell alone, but they muſt force others to go many miles in the broad way, who of themſelves would not have gone one; yet though this might ſeem to diſcourage him to ſee what Merchandize was made of ſouls, he conſcienciouſly, and conſtantly laboured to counterwork theſe Factors of Hel, and drove a trade for God in beſtirring himſelf to inſinuate into any lad that was ingenious, and was very ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full therein, to the aſtoniſhment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of his oppoſers: many had great cauſe to bleſs God for him, and their firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, for his bringing them to Dr. <hi>Preſtons,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sibbs</hi> his Lectures in thoſe times, and ſome (to the knowledge of a Reverend and learned Divine, his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friend at the Univerſity, from whom I have this part of the narrative) that are yet alive have bleſſed God for their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him; this his unwearied di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104265:11"/>
in trafficking for God in his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger years was ſo generally obſerved in the Colledge, that it grew almoſt into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb among the lewd and profane Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that <hi>ſuch and ſuch a youth was poiſon'd by Cawton's faction, and was become a Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſt,</hi> which nevertheleſs could not in the leaſt deterr him from proſecuting the work of the Lord, or from abiding and abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, but rather rooted and grounded him, eſpecially when he conſidered his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was not in vain in the Lord, and that God did graciouſly let him ſee of the travell of his Soul, in the welfare of thoſe Souls which he had been a means to deliver from being taken captive at Satans will.</p>
            <p>He remained faithful in this good imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as alſo in following his private ſtudies in the Univerſity, till he took his degree of Maſter of Arts, ſeldom abſenting: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſerved an apprenticeſhip of ſeven years to humane learning, he found it prov'd but a blear-ey'd <hi>Leah</hi> (as an ingenious Author loves to ſpeak) and not ſo amiable as was expected; therefore now he reſolves to ſerve for <hi>Rachel,</hi> that is Divinity, which is more beautiful and quick-ſighted.</p>
            <p>In order to his ſtudy of Divinity he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for a time from the Univerſity to a place called <hi>Aſhwell,</hi> twelve miles from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to live in the houſe of that Reverend and holy man of God Mr. <hi>Herbert Palmer,</hi> then

            <p>About this time his worthy <hi>Moecenas</hi> (ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be mentioned without a Preface of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) Sir <hi>Roger Townſend</hi> being very ſick unto death, ſent for him, but he could not come, (though he made all poſſible haſt) ſoon enough to ſee him living: yet Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> had not forgot him, for juſt before his death he ſealed a preſentation of him to living in <hi>Eſſex</hi> called <hi>Wivenbo</hi> not far from <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> that being then void.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104265:13"/>
than to diſobey God the Creator.</p>
            <p>He was inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, preaching againſt that ſin, reproving them with much zeal, meekneſs and compaſſion to their Souls: perſwading them not to go to ſea on Saturday, which they moſtly didin regard of a Market near by kept on Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, which they ſaid was the beſt market thereabouts for their profit: ſuch and the like cavils he eaſily removed, ſhewing the weakneſs of them, and bringing arguments againſt their ungodly courſes, to confute their ſpecious pretences which Satan ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to them to defend their ſins withall, and to defeat the reaſons that were brought on Gods ſide for their eternall welfare.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding his publick preaching, and his private admoniſhing, he found it a very difficult work to bring them off from that ſinful practice, (ſea-men of all men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt obſtinate) yet he gave not over, he was not ſhort breath'd in the work of the Lord, but ſtill was importunate with them to look to Soul-work and eternity work, and proceeded to ſharp and cutting rebukes plainly ſtating their caſe here, and their caſe hereafter. Many of his Pariſh would ſend him fiſh in the evening of the Lords day, but he never would receive any: he would not be bribed to ſtop his mouth, but more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently declaimed againſt their fin, and gave them no reſt, till there was ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation

wrought in the place, as cauſed the admiration of ſuch as knew that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Thus it pleaſed God to give a bleſſing to his unwearied labours amongſt them in a plentifull Harveſt of converts, many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in to him, and ſeeing the evil of their ſins, were ſavingly wrought upon, and given in to him as the ſeals of his Miniſtry: others were reſtrained to an aſtoniſhment: the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of godlineſs did ſo ſhine in his Doctrine and life, that it had a commanding autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the conſciences of thoſe with whom he converſed: It was well ſaid of one, that a good Miniſter will reform a Pariſh better than a Juſtice of peace, he ſpits fire into mens conſciences and binds them over to the great Aſſizes: I am ſure the change that by his means was made in the People of <hi>Wivenbo</hi> was ſo remarkable that it deſerves to be regiſtred in Marble, if that be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable enough to perpetuate ſo famous an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of ſo profane a generation of drunkards, ſwearers and Sabbath-breakers: that an <hi>Aegypt</hi> for darkneſs and ignorance ſhould be turned into a <hi>Goſhen</hi> of light and knowledge, a <hi>Bethaven</hi> changed into a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel</hi> deſerves to be written in immotall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.</p>

an infirm conſtitution; the badneſs of the air at <hi>Wivenho</hi> did not a little add to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers. At the end of the ſeventh year of his abode in <hi>Wivenho,</hi> he had a very great fit of ſickneſs, in ſo much that his Phyſitians and friends did even deſpair of his recovery: but it pleaſed the great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian who was his Maker, as he had built the cottage of his body, ſo to ſhoar up the building, and he was in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to health: whereupon the advice of his Phyſicians was, he ſhould change the air, and get out of that could wateriſh place he was in, and the more becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly was troubled with an ague twice a year at leaſt. <hi>London</hi> was the place which was thought might beſt agree with his thin body: a great many arguments were uſed by his friends to perſwade him to leave <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venho,</hi> but none could prevail but that of neceſſity, by reaſon of the intire love he bore to his people, and the great bleſſing he ſaw God gave to his Miniſtry in that place. Neceſſity urging him more and more to look after his health; he was at length brought to hearken after a place to ſerve Gods Church in at <hi>London:</hi> and his intentions being made known, he was quickly called to the Pariſh of <hi>Bartholomews</hi> behind the Royall Exchange: the main inſtrument of his ſettlement in that living was Sir <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottle Grimſtone</hi> who at that time dwelt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104265:17"/>
in the ſame Pariſh, and was his exceeding good friend.</p>
            <p>In <hi>London</hi> it pleaſed God, he had his health farr better than at <hi>Wivenho,</hi> and quite loſt the ague he was uſed to have twice a year all the while he was there.</p>
            <p>His health did not a little encourage him to his former painfulneſs in the work of the Miniſtry, in which he now laboured more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly than ever, he was more carefull of himſelf than ever, knowing he had now more eyes obſerving him than ever, and <hi>that the ſins of Teachers were Teachers of ſins:</hi> he was well acquainted with the meaning of the Ceremony, <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. 24. where <hi>Moſes</hi> put the bloud on the lap of the Prieſts right ear, on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot; Miniſters muſt hear, work, and walk right: and therefore he dayly went out and in before his people, as an enſample to the flock: the very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane of the Pariſh would ſay, they believed Mr. <hi>Cawton</hi> did really believe what he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, when they were ready to bark and ſnarl at others, and ſay of them (as one ſaid of vicious Miniſters) that when they are in the Pulpit it's pity they ſhould ever come out, they are ſo good in their Inſtructions; when out of the Pulpit it's pity they ſhould ever come in again, they are ſo bad in their converſations.</p>
            <p>Having preached ſome time, he began to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104265:17"/>
reſume his old Theme of oppoſing Hereſies which crept in a pace into the Kingdom: He proved a true <hi>Malleus Haereticorum,</hi> and a <hi>

            <p>In the year 1648. the <hi>February</hi> after King <hi>Charls</hi> the firſt (of glorious memory) was moſt inhumanly and unnaturally beheaded, he was deſired by the Mayor of the City (then in being) to Preach before him and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Aldermen of <hi>London</hi> at <hi>Mercers Chappel</hi> on the 25. of that Month; which he undertook, and accordingly performed. In his Prayer, as he thought it his duty, he prayed for our <hi>Legall Sovereign</hi> and the <hi>Royal Family.</hi> In his Sermon he laid nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Auditory but Goſpel-truths; but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of Souldiers too much (as they thought) to the Divine rule, and ſhewing them how in their places they ought to adorn the Goſpel, which was a thing too preciſe for them that could violently do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing: he was much threatned by them, ſwearing they would moleſt him as ſoon as he had done, but God ſo reſtrained them that they were hindred in their deſign at that time: he did in his Sermon glance at
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104265:18"/>
mens pretending <hi>an impulſe of ſpirit</hi> and thinking <hi>the ſucceſs of their cauſe was an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of its goodneſs,</hi> and in ſeverall expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did much croſs the ſectaries, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killers of that time: I have added the heads of that Sermon (as full as he writ them) to this narrative, hoping they will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome to the world.</p>
            <p>For that time he eſcaped the hands of unreaſonable men, or rather the paws of roaring Lions, and raving Wolves; but not long after having a faſt at his own Church, and he concluding the day, there was a warrant procured by ſome malicious ſectaries and Soldiers, that had given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of what they had heard at <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers Chappel,</hi> (ſtiling his preaching there ſeditious) ſummoning him to appear before the Councill of State, (it might well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Councill of Eſtate, for they conſulted much together how to take away men eſtates, if not lives) when he had concluded the faſt, the warrant brought by ſome Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats was preſented to him in the very Church, ſo greedy they were of their prey, the warrant ran thus:</p>

ſomething to refreſh himſelf, having faſted all the day: this they though unwillingly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to, and they were followed with whole multitudes of people, which thronged about the houſe (crying out againſt their unjuſt dealings) to ſee him go with the Soldiers: having refreſhed himſelf and prayed, he ſent for a Coach, and with unparallel courage and cheerfulneſs, taking a friend or two with him, went to the Councel of Eſtates, &amp; though the Warrant was only for <hi>Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Preaching,</hi> yet when he came before them they had nothing to lay to his charge but thoſe words in his Prayer for our <hi>LEGAL SOVEREIGN</hi> and the <hi>ROYAL FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MILY.</hi> He told them he came to anſwer for a ſeditious Sermon, not for his Prayer according to their Warrant, but they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed him no other way, than by telling him he had proclaimed the King, and that was high treaſon according to an Act of their own making, which made all loyalty Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when they themſelves were the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
            <p>Hereupon that compleat Hypocrite <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> did with extremity of indignity &amp; ſeverity admoniſh and command him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant of what he had ſaid: but Mr. <hi>Cawton</hi> no whit daunted by his proud inſolent car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, was Mr. <hi>Cawton</hi> ſtill, <hi>ſemper idem,</hi> and told him, <hi>If I have done any thing not becoming a Miniſter of the Goſpel, I hope I</hi>

He could confute an eye of ſence by an eye of faith, and truſt providence where he could not trace it. Indeed it were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be a believer if every thing were ſeen here, but to put a holy confidence in that unſeen power that does ſo mightily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us, that is to believe. He promiſed himſelf but little from the creature, and ſo was never much deceived by it, he could ask himſelf that queſtion, and anſwer it with the advice of the wiſe Hebrew.</p>

He would often ſay, <hi>I do obſerve ſome profeſſors give a great deal of ſcope to the fleſh, which they of all men ſhould not do, but ſhould tye, up their affections ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and if God be God, live as thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</hi> It was (as one obſerves) <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his ſpeech that ſince men could not bring the

He could ſtrip him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his <hi>poſſe</hi> and <hi>poſſidere,</hi> all his abilities and enjoyments, and lay himſelf and them down at the foot of his Saviour: he was ſo much above himſelf that all things were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and thought he was never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly himſelf, till he had perfectly put off himſelf, his intereſt, his judgment, his will, his affections, his relations, his all went at a word from Chriſt, he denyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and denyed all, now judge whether this were not true ſelf-deny-all.</p>

This his patience was boiled up into joy and triumphing in tribulation, he expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more joy in parting with the world, than ever he did for the enjoyment of it: He was ever contented with a little of the creature; but when God called him to it he cared not for any thing of it, thinking thoſe wants well ſupplyed that were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with contentedneſs: It's not abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance that contenteth and enricheth, but want, to wit, the want of deſire, for he that is poor in deſires is rich in content, <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae opes inopia cupiditatum,</hi> He that deſires nothing, is in ſome ſort like God and thoſe that are already bleſſed, who are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py not becauſe they have all, but becauſe

fortitude, and through the power of his might he could defie every thing beſides and below God, the joy of the Lord was his ſtrength, he had not only his armour on him but in him. Reſolution (as one ſpeaks) as a ſtrong ſtream carries down all before it, little good is done in Religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and with it, all is as good as done: his chriſtian generoſity and magnanimity fitted him for any encounter, and put him upon a <gap reason="foreign">

I grieve for my dear friends in the Pariſh that will be left as ſheep without a ſhepheard, but God will provide for them; remember my dear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to them all, they ſhall have my prayers; and I hope I ſhall have theirs.

Preſently after the writing of theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, (in which above all things I cannot but take notice of his humility and vile e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of himſelf) he made preparation for his voyage, and ſecretly departed by ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> from whence he and Mr. <hi>Nalton</hi> went to the Univerſity of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> intending to ſit down a while there, till the ſtorm in <hi>England</hi> was blown over: yet Gods providence ſo ordered it (that though they came ſomthing under a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe) yet they were quickly known, and ſpeedily meſſengers were ſent from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Congregation at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> to find them out, and bring them thither, the place being at that very time by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence deſtitute of a Miniſter.

            <p>No ſooner had <hi>Nimrod,</hi> that mighty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, chaſed theſe lambs out of their Native Land, but he and his creatures ſent Mr. <hi>Love</hi> out of his earthly into an heavenly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by beheading that faithfull Antipas, for his love and Loyalty to his Majeſty's ſervice, to the diſhonour of Religion, and grief of Gods People all over the Nation, and eſpecially of his two baniſhed Brethren.</p>

This holy man of God ſo accuſtomed himſelf to the Scriptures that he never roſe in a morning but the firſt thing he did was to take his Bible into his hand,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104265:33"/>
and ſo lifting up his eyes to heaven in a moſt ſerious manner, he prayed ſhortly, and then read ſome portion of Scripture or other: which being obſerved by his loving Conſort, ſhe asked him why he uſed that practiſe? and he told her, <hi>

was ended, he had the cup admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to himſelf alone, thus he was ſick of love for him that dyed out of love to him: ever ſince he was Miniſter he celebrated the Lords ſupper with ſo much heavenlineſs, and ſeriouſneſs that all his Communicants could not chooſe but obſerve and admire him, as if they had received Angels food from the hand of an Angel, for at that work he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf more than man.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In writing his ſermons he uſed to ſet down nothing but his heads and places of Scripture, ſo that his notes are very ſhort, and ſo very unfit for the publick: he never read any thing in his Sermons, but always laid his notes behind him, and would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort young men from reading, telling them that <hi>memory loved to be truſted:</hi> he could ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aptly and affectionately enlarge upon his ſhort heads <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and with a little prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation would (even when he was young) inſiſt two hours upon ſo many heads as might be contained in leſs than half a page in ſmall octavo, as I have books and papers of his to ſhew. This his brevity has hindred the publiſhing of any of his works though they were much deſired, eſpecially his Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemes of Divinity, and ſeverall excellent Sermons on aſſurance: only I have here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a ſpecimen, one Sermon annexed to this Narrative which was never intended by him for the preſs, that the Chriſtian

Reader may have ſomthing of his, it being the fulleſt written of any Sermon of his I could find, though in it ſelf it be very ſhort.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He himſelf obſerved that Providence kept him about ſeven years in every place he was in, God ſo ordered his affairs that he was ſeven years at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> ſeven at <hi>Wivenho,</hi> ſeven at <hi>London,</hi> and as many at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> He would often ſay towards the end of the ſeventh year in <hi>Holland, where ſhall I be next?</hi> but God had no more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiſhips for him to ſerve; The good and faithfull ſervant that had his Maſters joys entering into him here, is now entred into his Maſters joy, he could not contain them all, and therefore they contain him: the leſs was laid out for him here the more was laid up for him in Heaven. He that thought Heaven to be perfect without the Earth, and Earth without Heaven to be Hell, is now above Earth and Hell: his ſeven years are now turned into eternity, and all his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſwallowed up in glory, glorious things are ſpoken of thee, (and now by thee) O man of God! thou art gone to preach Heavenly Sermons, and art become of a Miniſter a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring ſpirit before the Lord, verily I ſay unto thee, thou haſt thy reward.</p>
            <p>Thus as a Miniſter.</p>
            <p>As a Maſter, he was a Prophet, Prieſt, and King in his Family, a Prophet to teach, a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104265:35"/>
Prieſt to pray for, and a King to govern it, he was a true <hi>Pater familias,</hi> not ſo much a Maſter as a Father of a family; though he could truſt God when Gods cauſe required it with his family, yet he did provide for it (God inabling him) in a plentifull manner, though he thought him worſe than an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del that provides not for his own houſe, yet he counted him no better than an Infidel that does it by Infidelity, or any other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable means. He could not abide to trouble himſelf with worldly affairs, but committed all to his ſecond ſelf: He thought it below a man, much more below a Miniſter, to be at leiſure to take account of what was ſpent in his houſe: He was given to hoſpitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, even in <hi>Holland</hi> where his means were ſmal in compariſon of his charge; he never dined on a Sabbath day without ſome of the poorer ſort of his Congregation, and he would be ſure not to forget to call upon them when he came out of the Church, to come and take part of what God had given him. He was ſo milde and meek natur'd to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that he did ſeem rather to love than to rule them; he thought <hi>impetrare melius quam imperare,</hi> it better to deſire than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them: by which ſweet diſpoſition he wrought ſo deeply upon them, that they could not but love him and ſpeak well of him, nay ſome of his ſervants, next to God, owe their Salvation to his Miniſtry and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104265:36"/>
He was the ſame at home he was abroad, and the ſame in his heart as he was in his houſe: He kept a conſtant hour morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and evening for reading the Scripture to, and praying with his family, thinking that they that kept no ſet time were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to keep no time. Company coming in at the time ſet a part for family duties, if they were ſuch as he knew would join with him, he deſired them to ſtay with him and defer their buſineſs till after prayers; if they were ſuch as he thought would not joyn with him, he would ſend his ſecond ſelf a part with his children to pray with them. Thus this man of God behaved himſelf as a Maſter.</p>
            <p>As an Husband, he was loving and tender; he choſe a Wife for her lovely vertues, and loved her with the greateſt affection; he found not only his Rib, but his Heart when he found her; they wedded one anothers humors as well as perſons, and ſo went the ſhorteſt way to perfection. He never denied her any thing in all his life that was conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with his Miniſtry, and ſhe never deſired any thing but what was becoming the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. He made her his Collateral, not his Servant; if he were the Head, ſhe was not at his feet, but at his ſide, and in his heart. He would be ſtirring her up to reſolution for God, not that he thought her backward, but to make her more forward. He would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his ſecrets to her whom he knew to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104265:36"/>
be faithful, and of his mind. He would not ſlight her advice and counſel in any buſineſs, but if good, embrace and execute it. As for Temporals, he gave her the diſpoſing of all, himſelf ſeldom medling with any ſuch affairs unleſs they were too hard for her to do. In all things he behaved himſelf ſo as in all the 20 years they were married to one another there was not the leaſt jar or diſcord, no, not diſſent or diſlike between them, but a perfect ſympathy and union, nay unity of affections.</p>
            <p>As a Father, he was very carefull for his childrens good, training them up in the way they ſhould go; he took a great deal of pains to inſtruct and catechiſe them, to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; he counted good education the beſt portion, it's well ſaid of one, that a little grace will make a great ſhew in a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred perſon, whereas a great deal of grace will make but a little ſhew in an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred perſon.

To his example he added many encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both by ſpeeches and gifts; he never let any ſparks go out for want of blowing up either by commendation or reward; he was wiſely indulgent, and would diſpenſe with any ſlip but breaking of God Laws. If he came to correct his Children, he did it with ſo much love, that his ſweet admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and pathetical inſtructions, ſhewing the evil they had done, and his lothneſs to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, but that it was Gods Ordinance, did more break their hearts than the correction it ſelf: He was often ſo moved with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, his fatherly bowels did ſo yearn over them, that the tears would trickle a pace from his eies when he was correcting them: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ever wrought upon me like this ſight, which did plainly convince his Children of his unwillingneſs to chaſtiſe, but that he was forced to it; his tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>To return from whence I digreſſed, This Man of God had not been long at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> but his fame was ſpread abroad all over the united Provinces, eſpecially <hi>Holland;</hi> He that valued Gods glory above his Name in his own Countrey, received his own name in a ſtrange, and Gods glory in an heavenly Countrey. He ſhone in that Firmament as a Star of the firſt magnitude, and was highly eſteemed of by the Dutch, French and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Miniſters round about. He had corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with moſt of the famous Profeſſors, particularly with Dr. <hi>Gisbert Voetius,</hi> Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Profeſſor, and Mr. <hi>Leuſden,</hi> Profeſſor of the Oriental Languages at <hi>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104265:38"/>
the one of <hi>Leiden,</hi> the other of <hi>Breda:</hi> ſeveral Letters there paſſed between them, ſome of which I have to ſhew.</p>
            <p>From <hi>England</hi> he had whole ſhowers of Letters from his Brethren the Miniſters, and his friends congratulating his ſafety, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſpeak boldly in the name of Chriſt. He was much honored, and often written to by Dr. <hi>Walton,</hi> &amp; was not a little uſeful in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the great work of the <hi>Polyglot</hi> Bible, partly by procuring ſubſcriptions, partly by ſending over Manuſcripts. He was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards written to by Dr. <hi>Caſtell,</hi> whoſe <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glot Lexicon</hi> got ſeveral Subſcriptions by his means: and by Mr. <hi>Samuel Clark</hi> concerning another Volume to be added to the Oriental Bible: he was known to be of ſo publick a ſpirit in any thing that was for the profit of the Common-wealth of Learning, and the good of Gods Church, that he was ſought to of moſt that did any ſingular matter in order to the encreaſe of learning.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Rotterdam</hi> were a place very wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh and could, yet He took great notice of Gods great goodneſſe in reference to his health, which was better the five firſt yeares, than ever it had bin in any place in his own Country. It's not an healthful climate but a good Phyſitian, even the Lord that healeth us, that makes us healthfull. He would ſay, <hi>I thank God I have preached twice a day every Lords day</hi> (beſides faſt and thankſgiving days,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104265:38"/>
as alſo his monthly adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament) <hi>for five years together, and have not had five</hi> (three was the moſt) <hi>Sermons given me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the two or three laſt yeares he was weak, and for half a year together went with a continuall pain at his ſtomack, ſo that it was a very difficult thing for him to Preach, yet he left not off, but cheerfully and conſtantly preached, as at other times: though he never went up into the Pulpit, but every one thought he would either faint or die before he came down: he was indeed weary in his work, but never weary of his work. Once he did faint in the Pulpit, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that his voice failed him, and he was taken down, being unable to proceed, but by the means of cordial Waters given him he recovered his Spirits in ſome meaſure, yet not ſo as to Preach in the afternoon: when his Friends came about him in the evening, he told them, <hi>the Pulpit is a good place to die in.</hi> By the next Sabbath he was (by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing) recruited, and preached forenoon and afternoon with much vigour and zeal: but from that time till within half a year of his death I ſaw him evidently decay.</p>
            <p>About this time he had an only Son al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fit for the Univerſity, whom he did always, but eſpecially now much inſtruct, and forward in his ſtudies: Mr. <hi>Robert She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringham</hi> being then in exile at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> he

ſent his ſon to him to learn the <hi>Hebrew, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack,</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> tongues, before he went to the Academy: and would every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing call him to his bedſide, to expound a Greek or Hebrew chapter: He ſpent much time in catechizing him in particular, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning him with the knowledge of God, and charging him to walk as in Gods ſight, when he was from under his Fathers eye. The time coming, he went with him to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>

He gave his ſon much good counſell and directions in his ſtudies, and was very deſirous of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs: He would ſtrive to enflame this young ſchollar's heart with an Heroick ambition to get learning, and as he himſelf had done; and would exhort him moſt affectionately to ſtrive to be <hi>inter eruditiſſimos non inter medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres.</hi> He gave him theſe four rules, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved, were very effectuall to get learning, and to keep it in readineſs.</p>

I do intend to conſider, what paper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>books you muſt have for all ſorts of learning: in the mean time I would have you note things in a quire of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that you may tranſcribe them when you have ſetled your method: you may call your book of daily notes

            <p>The Latine Tranſlation of this Letter was ſent at the ſame time from the King, which for brevities ſake I omit.</p>
            <p>The laſt half year he was taken notice of, to look better, and ſome ſaid fatter in the face than ever before, inſomuch that many of his friends were not a little deceived: the truth is, he himſelf found himſelf better than ever, yet did many times caſt out ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as if he could not live long.</p>
            <p>The laſt Sabbath he ever preached was the third of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1659. that day he admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104265:45"/>
the Sacrament of the Lords Supper with his wonted heavenlineſs, and preached fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon and afternoon, with as much zeal as ever he was known to do: his Text was that of our Saviour to his Diſciples, <note place="margin">John 15. 3.</note>
               <hi>Now ye are clean through the Word which I have ſpoken unto you:</hi> ſhewing, that the uſual means whereby men are made clean, was the preaching of the Goſpel, <note place="margin">Auguſtin.</note>
               <hi>the Word which I have ſpoken, non quia dicitur, ſed quia creditur:</hi> not becauſe it's ſpoken, but becauſe it's believed: the Word is the Inſtrument by which men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and believing, they are made clean. He made two excellent Sermons on thoſe words; and if he had known he ſhould have concluded his Miniſtry that day, he could not (me thinks) have choſen a fitter Text to conclude withall. Now ye are clean, now ye have heard me preach ſo often; now ye are ſo diligent and attentive to what I preach: now I ſhall preach no more, now ye are clean, though the word believed, embraced, and accompanied with Gods Spirit: at leaſt, now I am clean and clear from your blood, I have Spoken unto you, and my words will judge you at the laſt day, if you will not hear, the privledge you have had above others to hear will aggravate your ſin and puniſhment. Theſe were the laſt words of this man of God to his people, and I queſtion not but they have taken ſome impreſſion on their hearts.</p>

               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:104265:46"/>Having ſpent himſelf much with preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and being wearied by the great pains he had taken that day, after the afternoon Sermon (according to his uſual manner) he laid himſelf down upon his bed to reſt and repoſe himſelf a little: after he had ſlumbred about half an hour, he awaked and having ſome warm thing brought him to drink, he drank heartily, but ſaid not any thing, being a little ſleepy. He laid down again about a quarter of an hour, and had another little ſlumber, and then riſing, got up alone, and ſat upon his bed-ſide: his Wife perceiving him to look very ill, (though ſhe did not in the leaſt ſuſpect or expect any more danger than formerly) asked him how he did? he anſwered, <hi>I cannot tell how:</hi> ſhe leading him to a chair two or three ſteps off, he ſat down and ſuddenly fainted. He was a good while rubbed, and chafed, having his mouth opened by force to pour in ſtrong waters, and coming a little to himſelf, he lifted up his eyes and ſaid, I ſhall never come to my ſelf again: whereupon his Wife ſaid to his Son fetch the Doctor quickly, but he ſaid no, no, Mr. <hi>Shepheard,</hi> a loving friend very near him: yet when he came he could not ſpeak to him. The Doctor was juſt gone by his door, and coming back, gave him ſome little Phyſick which wrought well: but he was very ſick, and faint, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpeak, ſo that about ſeven a clock he
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104265:46"/>
was had to bed, and continued ſlumbering all night, not once ſpeaking to any, or ſo much as opening his eyes, but refuſing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing the Doctor appointed him to take.

It proved to be a palſey all over his right ſide, and tongue, and ſo he lay till four a clock on Thurſday morning being the ſeventh of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1659. and then gave up the ghoſt. Yet obſervable it is that on Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday he called for all his children by name and bleſſed them, laying his hand on their head, and lifting up his eyes, and had his memory ſo well, that one of his children being wanting, (ſleeping in its cradle) he ſaid <hi>one more,</hi> and ſo it was brought to him. He had his eye fixed for a great while toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on his eldeſt ſon, and ſtroked him often as he ſtood by him, lifting up his eyes to Heaven, in token of his praying for him. And now if tears were words I could be both fluent, and eloquent, if my tears could do him good they might ſeem juſt, nay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my tears are juſt becauſe I cannot do him good. But I muſt (as one ſays) when I have deplored the death of my friend as a friend, learn to bear it as a Saint, <hi>it's a wretched virtue not to know what to do elſe than bewail the dead.</hi> I have not ſo many tears to

Not <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his death, but his riſing to the miſeries of the world again drew tears from Chriſts eies.<note place="margin">Chriſtus non pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And thus I have (Chriſtian Reader) run over the ſeveral parts and paſſages of this man of Gods life, and followed him from his Cradle to his Grave: He was about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years old when he died, of ſtature tall and thin, in countenance lean and pale, of a very weak conſtitution, yet very active and ſtirring: of a courteous nature, very affable and eaſie to to be intreated; in his

faſhions neither rude nor fantaſtick: He was both morall and gracious, and in all his actions gracefull, Earth hath loſt and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath gained a Saint by his death. <note place="margin">
