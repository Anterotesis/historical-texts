            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READERS.</head>
            <p>THis Title <hi>no body can think is meant
to condemn all</hi> Contention about
matters of Religion as carnal; <hi>but
since there is</hi> too much <hi>which is apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
so, <hi>it only signifies it to be the Design of
the</hi> following Discourse <hi>to shew</hi> what
Contention that is, <hi>and when, or in what
case, tho' it hath</hi> Religion <hi>for it's</hi> Object, <hi>it
may not have it for it's</hi> Principle, <hi>but that</hi>
very frequently, <hi>the</hi> Lust of the Flesh
<hi>hides it self</hi> under that specious Name.
<hi>And to shew</hi> wherein, <hi>while it affects to</hi>
hide, <hi>yet unawares it</hi> discovers <hi>it self in
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:96046:3"/>
the management of Affairs of</hi> that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
kind.</p>
            <p>Thus it often really is; and then is that
noble Cause as ignobly served, as when (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that Fathers Observation) a
man proves to be <hi>unfaithful even for the
Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cypr. de Simplie. Prael.</note> and <hi>Sacrilegious for Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVhen <hi>in one place (Jude 3.)</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are <hi>exhorted</hi> to <hi>contend earnestly
for the Faith;</hi> and <hi>in another, (2 Tim.
2. 24.)</hi> we are told the Servant of the
Lord <hi>must not strive;</hi> 'tis plain there is
a Contention <hi>for Religion,</hi> which is a <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and there is a Contention, even <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Religion</hi> too, which is a <hi>Sin.</hi>
And <hi>that Sin</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> in <hi>this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,</hi>
out of which our Discourse arises,
doth deservedly <hi>expose</hi> by the <hi>Name of
Flesh,</hi> and of the <hi>Lust,</hi> or of the <hi>Works</hi>
thereof; such as <hi>Wrath, Variance, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
Hatred,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VVhence it is easie to collect</hi> in what
sense <hi>it is said in the mentioned place,</hi>
The Servant of the Lord must not
strive, <hi>viz. As</hi> that striving <hi>excludes
the</hi> Gentleness, <hi>the</hi> aptness to instruct,
<hi>and the</hi> Patience, <hi>which are</hi> in the same
place <hi>enjoyned, where</hi> that striving <hi>is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:96046:3"/>
               <hi>And from thence it is equally easie to
collect too, in what sense we ought</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for the Faith earnestly, <hi>i. e. with
all that</hi> earnestness <hi>which will</hi> consist
with these, <hi>not with such as</hi> excludes
them. <hi>As</hi> earnestly <hi>as you will, but with
a</hi> sedate Mind, <hi>full of</hi> Charity, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
Kindness <hi>and</hi> Benignity <hi>towards
them we strive with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We ought, we see (in the mentioned
place) to</hi> be patient towards all Men.
Towards Fellow-Christians <hi>there should
certainly be a more peculiar</hi> Brotherly-kindness.</p>
            <p>The difference is very great, and most
discernable in the <hi>Effects</hi> between the
<hi>Churches</hi> Contention against <hi>Enemies
without it,</hi> and Contentions <hi>within it
self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>former</hi> unite it the more, increase
it's strength and vigour. The <hi>latter</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
and enfeeble it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to</hi> those of this latter kind, <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is</hi> more evident, <hi>or deserves to be</hi>
more considered, <hi>than that as the</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church <hi>hath grown</hi> more carnal,
<hi>it hath grown</hi> more contentious, <hi>and as
more</hi> contentious, <hi>still more and more</hi>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:96046:4"/>
carnal. <hi>The</hi> savour <hi>hath been lost of
the</hi> great things of the Gospel, <hi>which
have less matter in them of</hi> Dispute <hi>or</hi>
Doubt, <hi>but which only did afford</hi> proper
Nutriment <hi>to the</hi> Life of Godliness, <hi>and
it hath diverted to</hi> lesser things, <hi>(or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
such as were, otherwise,</hi> none at
all) <hi>about which the</hi> contentious, dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
Genius <hi>might employ, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it might entertain, feed and satiate
it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thereby hath it grown <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,</hi>
and acquir'd the <hi>Power</hi> to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the <hi>Church</hi> from a <hi>Spiritual Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
enliven'd, acted and govern'd <hi>by the
Spirit of Christ,</hi> into a meer <hi>carnal
thing,</hi> like the rest of the World. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality</hi>
hath become, and long been in it a
<hi>Governing Principle,</hi> and hath torn it
into God-knows-how-many Fragments and
Parties; <hi>each of which</hi> will now be
<hi>the Church,</hi> inclose it self within <hi>it's
own peculiar Limits,</hi> exclusive of all the
rest, claim and <hi>appropriate</hi> to it self the
Rights and Priviledges which belong to the
<hi>Christian Church in common,</hi> yea, and
even <hi>Christ himself,</hi> as if he were to be
so inclos'd or confin'd: And hence is it
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:96046:4"/>
said, <hi>Lo here is Christ,</hi> or <hi>there he is,</hi>
till he is scarce to be <hi>found any where;</hi>
but as, through merciful Indulgence, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking
our sinful Eollies, he is pleased to
afford <hi>some Tokens</hi> of his Presence both
<hi>here</hi> and <hi>there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet also how manifest are the <hi>Tokens</hi> of
his <hi>Displeasure</hi> and <hi>Retirement!</hi> And
how few will apprehend and consider the
true Cause!</p>
            <p>I will now adventure to offer these things
to serious Consideration.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Whether</hi> for any Party of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to make unto it self other Limits
of Communion than Christ hath made,
and hedge up it self within those Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
excluding those whom Christ
would admit, and admitting those
whom he would exclude, be not in it
self a real sin?</p>
            <p>When I say, <hi>[make to it self]</hi> this
<hi>more peculiarly</hi> concerns those who form
their own <hi>Communions,</hi> having nothing
herein impos'd upon them by <hi>Civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
Let others censure themselves as
they see cause.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They have an</hi> Holy Table <hi>among them,
the</hi> Symbol <hi>of their</hi> Communion with
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:96046:5"/>
one another in the Lord. <hi>I would ask whose
is this Table? Is it the Table of this or
that</hi> Man? <hi>or</hi> Party of Men? <hi>Or is it
the</hi> Lord's Table? <hi>Then certainly it
ought to be</hi> free <hi>to</hi> his Guests, <hi>and</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
<hi>to them. And who should dare
to</hi> invite others, <hi>or</hi> forbid these?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>If it be a Sin, is it not an hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
one?</hi> This will best be understood by
considering what <hi>his Limits</hi> are. Nothing
seems plainer than that it was his mind
<hi>Christianity it self</hi> should measure the
<hi>Communion of Christians, as such:
Visible Christianity</hi> their <hi>visible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>
It will here then be enquired, (as
in all reason it should) what <hi>Christianity</hi>
is. And if it be, every one will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Enquiry concerning <hi>that,</hi> as
they would concerning any thing else, what
is it's Essence? Or what are <hi>it's Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,</hi>
or wherein doth it <hi>consist?</hi> Not what
are all the <hi>several Accidents</hi> it may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of? As you would do, if it were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<hi>What is Humanity?</hi> Now
here it will be readily acknowledged that
<hi>Christianity</hi> (as all things else that are
<hi>of moral Consideration)</hi> must be esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
more principally by <hi>it's End,</hi> and
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:96046:5"/>
that it's <hi>final reference</hi> is not to <hi>this
World,</hi> but to the <hi>World to come,</hi> and
to an <hi>happy state there.</hi> And that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the <hi>miserable state</hi> wherein it
finds the Souls of Men <hi>here,</hi> and the
<hi>greater misery</hi> they are hereafter liable to,
it must design their <hi>present recovery,</hi> and
<hi>finally,</hi> their <hi>eternal Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That in order hereto it must propound
to men</hi> some things necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
<hi>some things necessary</hi> to be done.
<hi>And that</hi> both <hi>must intend the</hi> making
of them good <hi>in order to the</hi> making
them happy, <hi>or the saving of them from
eternal misery. That both are sufficiently
propounded by the</hi> kind <hi>and</hi> great Author
<hi>of this Constitution,</hi> Christ <hi>himself,</hi> in
his Word or Gospel. <hi>Yhat</hi> this Gospel,
<hi>besides many incidental things, expresly
represents some things</hi> as of absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to Salvation, <hi>by which are settled
the</hi> very Terms of Life and Death, <hi>unto
Sinners, and as a</hi> Principal, <hi>most</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive,
<hi>and most</hi> fundamental thing
<hi>to all the rest, requires men's</hi> resigning
and subjecting themselves <hi>unto</hi> him;
<hi>or putting themselves</hi> by Solemn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<hi>into his Hands,</hi> or under his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:96046:6"/>
               <hi>to be by him brought to God, and
made finally happy in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whatsoever therefore is of</hi> absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to this end <hi>is</hi> essential to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.
Christians <hi>then are a sort of
Men</hi> tending to God <hi>and</hi> Blessedness <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the</hi> Conduct of Christ, <hi>to whom they
have by</hi> Covenant devoted themselves,
<hi>and to</hi> God in him. Visible Christians
<hi>are such as are in</hi> this visible Tendency,
<hi>with</hi> their Children, <hi>yet</hi> in Minority,
<hi>and not capable of making an</hi> Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Profession <hi>themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such as have arrived to <hi>that Capacity</hi>
are no longer to be considered in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
but a part by themselves.</p>
            <p>They that have been sufficiently instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Principles of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that have devoted themselves to
God in Christ, and live in their general
course conformably to his Holy Rules, are
<hi>visible personal Covenanters.</hi> 'Tis
plainly the mind of Christ, that those be
receiv'd into <hi>that plenary Communion</hi>
which belongs to the <hi>Christian state;</hi> and
particularly, unto that <hi>Sacred Rite</hi> which
is the <hi>Communion of his Body and
Blood,</hi> and wherein the <hi>New Testament
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:96046:6"/>
or Covenant</hi> hath it's <hi>Solemn Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and wherein as <hi>Foederati,</hi> or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in Covenant, they have more express
<hi>Communion</hi> with him, and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>They that are yet unacquainted with the
<hi>most necessary things of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
are to he held as <hi>Cateohumens,</hi>
under Instruction, if they be willing.
They that live licentiously in the state of
<hi>Penitents,</hi> till they give that Proof of
their serious Repentance, as that their
Profession thereof appear not to be slight
and ludicrous.</p>
            <p>They that <hi>refuse to learn,</hi> or <hi>be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd;</hi>
that <hi>live in open Hostility</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>known Laws</hi> of Christ, are not
<hi>Visible Christians,</hi> are not visibly in the
way of Salvation. <hi>Visible Subjection</hi> and
<hi>visible Rebellion</hi> are <hi>Inconsistencies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore any Society of Men, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
Christian,</hi> do make <hi>other Limits</hi>
of their <hi>Communion; admitting</hi> those
that <hi>Christ's Rule excludes, excluding</hi>
them whom it would <hi>admit;</hi> especially, if
the <hi>Alteration</hi> be, not only by the <hi>making
those things necessary</hi> which he hath not
<hi>revealed</hi> or <hi>enjoyned</hi> as <hi>necessary,</hi> but
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:96046:7"/>
which he hath not <hi>revealed</hi> or <hi>enjoyned
at all;</hi> and so is not only to add to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion</hi> taken <hi>at large,</hi> but even
to <hi>it's Essentials:</hi> This is substantially to
change the Evangelical Covenant, to make
it another thing, to break Christ's Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and set up another. If they be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
things only that we add, we must know
there is <hi>nihil minimum in Religion.</hi>
What, if as little as they are, many think
them sinful, and are thereby thrown off
from our Communion! The less they are,
the greater the Sin to make them necessary,
to hang so great things upon them!
Break the Churches Peace and Vnity by
them, and of them to make a <hi>new
Gospel, new Terms of Life and Death,</hi>
a <hi>new way to Heaven.</hi> And is, as much
as in us lies, to make things of <hi>highest
Necessity,</hi> depend not only upon things of
<hi>no Necessity,</hi> but that are, in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<hi>perfect Nullities,</hi> not having <hi>any
place</hi> there at all. And thereupon is, <hi>in
effect</hi> to say, If you will not take <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>
with these <hi>Additions of ours, you
shall not be Christians;</hi> you shall have no
<hi>Christian Ordinances,</hi> no <hi>Christian
Worship;</hi> we will as far as in us is, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:96046:7"/>
you Heaven it self, and all means
of Salvation. And upon the same ground
upon which they may be <hi>excluded one
Communion</hi> by such <hi>arbitrary, devised
measures,</hi> they may be excluded <hi>another</hi>
also, and be received no where.</p>
            <p>And if their <hi>measures</hi> differ, they all
exclude one another; and hence, so many
<hi>Churches,</hi> so many <hi>Christendoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this be <hi>sinful,</hi> it is <hi>Sin</hi> of the <hi>deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Die.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi>
speak with such Severity as we know they
do, of the altering of <hi>Man's Landmarks,</hi>
what may me think of altering <hi>God's!</hi>
And the Sin is still the greater, if the things
of <hi>highest necessity</hi> are overlook'd in
the mean time as <hi>Trisles, tything of Mint</hi>
is stood upon, but <hi>Judgment, Faith, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and the Love of God pass'd over,</hi>
(as <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 23. Luke 11. 42.) <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi>
pour'd in upon the <hi>Church! Wolves
and Bears</hi> under the name of <hi>Sheep,</hi> and
the <hi>Lambs</hi> of Christ, (which he requires
to <hi>be fed)</hi> thrown out into the <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. But if we suppose it a <hi>Sin,</hi> and so
<hi>hainous a one,</hi> how far doth the guilt of
it spread! How few among the <hi>several
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:96046:8"/>
sorts</hi> and <hi>Parties</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
if the <hi>measures</hi> of their <hi>several
Communions</hi> were brought under just
and severe <hi>Examination!</hi> How sew that
lay their Communions open to <hi>visible Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
as such,</hi> excluding none of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Denomination, nor receiving any
that <hi>by Christian rational Estimate</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be judged such.</p>
            <p>4. How few that consider this as the
<hi>provoking Cause</hi> of Christ's being so
much a Stranger to the <hi>Christian Church!</hi>
And how little is it to be hoped we shall
ever see good days till this <hi>wasting Evil</hi>
be redress'd! Or that our <hi>glorious-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi>
who is <hi>Head of all things to
the Church,</hi> should ever own it by <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Favours,</hi> should protect, cherish, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
it, or make it spread in the World,
(and how little it is <hi>naturally</hi> in any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of doing so) or that he should treat
it <hi>as his,</hi> while it is so little <hi>it' self,</hi> and
so little <hi>one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>present</hi> (most deplorable) <hi>state
of things,</hi> private, (that is <hi>carnal) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi>
is the thing every where designed,
by <hi>one Party,</hi> and <hi>another.</hi> And by
wishing the Prosperity of <hi>the Church,</hi> or
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:96046:8"/>
endeavouring it, is only meant seeking the
Prosperity of <hi>our own Party.</hi> So that
there can be no <hi>United Prayers,</hi> nor <hi>joynt
Endeavours</hi> for any <hi>truly Common
good;</hi> but what seems <hi>desirable</hi> to <hi>some,</hi>
is <hi>dreaded</hi> and <hi>deprecated</hi> by <hi>all the
rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus for <hi>thirteen</hi> or <hi>fourteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years</hi> hath the <hi>Church</hi> been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
growing a <hi>Multiform, mangled,
shatter'd,</hi> and <hi>most deformed thing;</hi>
broken and parcell'd into no body knows
<hi>how many several sorts of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
The <hi>Measures</hi> whereof how <hi>strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alien</hi> have they been from those which
were <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>primitive,</hi> i. e. from
<hi>substantial Christianity,</hi> and the things
that must concurr to make up <hi>that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Instead of <hi>sound Knowledge</hi> of the
<hi>few, clear,</hi> and <hi>great</hi> things of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
a great many <hi>doubtful Opinions;</hi>

the determination of a <hi>Logical questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
understanding, or <hi>saying one under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands</hi>
(whether we do or no) a <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical
Nicety;</hi> and sometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
to believe somewhat that <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
never <hi>said,</hi> or shews it self never to

               <hi>have meant,</hi> and that is most manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contrary to all <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>common
sense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Instead of</hi> reverent, decent, grave,
Worship; affected, scenial, ludicrous
Formalities, uncouth gesticulations, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised
Countenances, <hi>with I know not
what</hi> empty shews <hi>of a</hi> forced <hi>and</hi> feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Devotion; <hi>which things also were to
serve instead of</hi> orderly, unreprovable
Conversation, <hi>of</hi> serving God, <hi>and of</hi>
doing good to other Men; <hi>and to</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
<hi>the Crimes of</hi> a very bad one, <hi>to
make amends, and atone for the</hi> lewdest,
<hi>the most</hi> licentious, <hi>and most</hi> misehiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Practices.</p>
            <p>In summe; not only are <hi>things most
alien</hi> from <hi>real Christianity added to
it,</hi> but <hi>substituted</hi> in the room of it, and
<hi>preferr'd</hi> before it. Yea and things most
<hi>destructive</hi> of it, indulged and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
in opposition to it.</p>
            <p>This is too generally the state of the
<hi>carnalized Christian Church.</hi> And ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
were there more fervent Contentions
<hi>among all sorts,</hi> whose <hi>Notions, Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
Modes,</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xv" facs="tcp:96046:9"/>
The Word of God tells us <hi>that to be
carnally minded is Death.</hi> These Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests
seem therefore to express great soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude
how most neatly to <hi>adorn a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kass,</hi>
or at best how with greatest Art and
Curiosity to <hi>trim,</hi> and <hi>apparel</hi> gorgeously,
a <hi>languishing Man,</hi> in the <hi>feared ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of Death,</hi> instead of endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>save his Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if <hi>any endeavour</hi> to that purpose
were yet to be used; what should it be?
That any Man should go about to <hi>propose</hi>
to the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> were both <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous,</hi>
and <hi>hopeless.</hi> We can only
speak our <hi>Wishes,</hi> to <hi>Men,</hi> and offer them
in <hi>solemn Supplications</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> And
it were an happy <hi>Omen,</hi> if good Men could
once agree what, <hi>in particular,</hi> to Pray
for; it being out of question that <hi>such
Men,</hi> would not be guilty of so much <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,</hi>
as to their uttermost, not seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to endeavour, what they durst ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
and thought it necessary to make
the Subject of their Prayers.</p>
            <p>And one would think it should not be
difficult to <hi>Men of sincere Minds,</hi> upon
serious Consideration of the present sad
State of things, not only <hi>in general</hi> to
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:96046:10"/>
pray for the <hi>true spiritual</hi> Welfare of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in the World; but
<hi>so far to be particular,</hi> as to Pray in
order thereto, that it may be <hi>more entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
One.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4 4.</note> We are told there is <hi>one body,</hi>
and <hi>one Spirit.</hi> That the <hi>Spirit, is but
One,</hi> we are sure is true <hi>in fact;</hi> and so
we are that <hi>the Body</hi> animated by <hi>that
Spirit,</hi> as <hi>it is such,</hi> can be but <hi>One</hi> also.
But the <hi>Apostles</hi> business <hi>in that place,</hi>
is not merely to <hi>assert</hi> such <hi>an Union,</hi> as
there <hi>already was,</hi> but also to perswade
to <hi>such a one</hi> as there yet <hi>was not;</hi> i. e.
that it might be more entire, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
than hitherto it was; and that such
an <hi>Unity might be preserved in the
Bond of Peace;</hi> and this is order to its
<hi>growth to the Measure of the Stature
of a perfect Man in Christ:</hi> Implying
plainly enough that the less it was <hi>One,</hi>
the less it would <hi>grow.</hi> Which also is
sufficiently evident <hi>in it self.</hi> For it is
<hi>first</hi> plain <hi>in the Nature of the thing,</hi>
that by how much it is more <hi>divided</hi> and
<hi>multiform,</hi> it will appear the less conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in the World, and so be less apt to
<hi>attract,</hi> and draw in others. Yea, and
its appearance and aspect will not only be
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:96046:10"/>
less <hi>inviting</hi> and <hi>attractive;</hi> but it will
be <hi>offensive,</hi> and create prejudices in the
minds of men against <hi>Christianity it self.</hi>
Which appears the plain meaning of that
<hi>Petition</hi> of our <hi>Blessed Lord,</hi> when he
was leaving the World, <hi>John 17. 21.
That they all might be one, as thou
Father art in me, and I in thee, that
they also may be one in us, that the
World may believe that thou hast sent
me.</hi> Implying manifestly, that if they
did not <hi>appear one,</hi> it would strongly
tempt the world to <hi>Infidelity.</hi> VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
all good men have a mighty Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to unite in <hi>this request;</hi> for more
entire <hi>visible Oneness</hi> in the Christian
Church, not only from <hi>the Example of
our Lord</hi> leading them in <hi>this Request,</hi>
but from <hi>the Reason</hi> also by which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces
it, that otherwise the rest of the
World must be confirmed and obdured in
their Infidelity. Who sees not therefore
that the <hi>Christian Interest</hi> is <hi>naturally</hi>
obstructed in it's <hi>extensive Growth</hi> by
the <hi>Visible Disunion</hi> of the <hi>Christian
Community?</hi> (for it can scarce admit
to be called a <hi>Society</hi> in it's present torn
and shatter'd state.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:96046:11"/>
And again, <hi>it's Divisions</hi> being (as
they cannot be other, than) <hi>criminal,</hi> the
effect of <hi>indulged Carnality,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to serve the <hi>carnal</hi> Interest of this
or that <hi>Party,</hi> in opposition to the rest;
they hereby not only offend and give Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
to the World, who thereupon discern
nothing of peculiar Excellency in the
<hi>Christian Profession,</hi> when under it they
see men driving but such low Designs, as they
themselves (more honestly) do without
any such Vail; but they offend the <hi>Spirit
of Christ</hi> too, who, thereupon, in great
degrees, withdraws it self; not <hi>totally,</hi>
which could not consist with the <hi>Promise,
[I am with you always,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 20.</note> 
               <hi>unto the end
of the world;]</hi> but unto such degrees
as shall testifie <hi>Displeasure.</hi> And hence is
the <hi>growth of the Church</hi> obstructed,
not only <hi>naturally,</hi> but <hi>penally</hi> too.
Whence it is most evident, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>with Judgment</hi> pray for the Spiritual
welfare of the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> who
pray not for it's Vnion; nor <hi>with Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
who to their uttermost endeavour it
not also.</p>
            <p>Nor can there be <hi>true Seriousness,</hi> in
<hi>so much,</hi> but the Consideration must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:96046:11"/>
what course is most likely to serve so
desireable an end. And since <hi>necessary
things</hi> are <hi>most plain,</hi> and less liable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>dispute</hi> and <hi>doubt;</hi> and it is <hi>matter of
Fact,</hi> obvious to every observing Eye,
that the <hi>Disceptations</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> in
the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> which are, and
have been, from <hi>Age</hi> to <hi>Age,</hi> do for the
most part arise from the <hi>Addition</hi> of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
things</hi> to it, which belong not
to <hi>it's Constitution;</hi> and which while
some think <hi>lawful</hi> only, and, at best, but
an <hi>Ornament</hi> to it, others think <hi>sinful</hi>
and a <hi>Deformity;</hi> it cannot hence but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
a thing much to be desired, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
that <hi>these occasions</hi> of <hi>Offence</hi>
and <hi>Division</hi> might cease, and be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Which even they that think <hi>such
Additions,</hi> to be, <hi>for the matter</hi> of them
lawful, might yet see reason enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and to endeavour should be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
yea, though they apprehend them of
some <hi>use;</hi> it being so manifest that the
<hi>hurt</hi> which accrues by them is unspeakably
<hi>more.</hi> And besides, one would think it
should not be unapprehensible to any Man
that allows himself the free use of his
Thoughts, that though he should continue
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:96046:12"/>
of the Judgment, that <hi>such Additions</hi>
were in <hi>the matter of them</hi> lawful, yet
the making them <hi>Additional Terms</hi> of
<hi>Christian Communion</hi> must be highly
sinful, as being the Introduction of a <hi>new
Christianity.</hi> Christian Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Christians as such.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>this Amputation</hi> is, according to
the present posture of men's minds all the
Christian World over, a thing equally to
be <hi>desired</hi> and <hi>despaired</hi> of. As a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Union</hi> therefore is, <hi>in the mean
time.</hi> We cannot unite with them who
insist upon <hi>Terms of Union</hi> that we judge
<hi>unlawful, in those things.</hi> For those that
insist upon Terms that we think not simply
<hi>unlawful,</hi> while yet they are <hi>different,</hi> in
several Christian Societies; we cannot,
<hi>therein,</hi> unite with any; but we must,
for ought we know, divide from as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>That only which the present state of
things admits of, is, that we keep our selves
united <hi>in Mind and Spirit</hi> with all <hi>seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Christians,</hi> in the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
things</hi> wherein they <hi>all agree:</hi> That
we preserve in our own Spirits a <hi>resolved
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:96046:12"/>
unaddictedness</hi> to <hi>any Party,</hi> in the
things wherein <hi>they differ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That for <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>local Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
(which we cannot have with all the
Christians in the world, and can have
comparatively but with <hi>a few)</hi> we joyn
with them that come nearest us, <hi>i. e.</hi> that
we judge come nearest to our <hi>common
Rule.</hi> That (as some means hereto) we
especially labour to <hi>center</hi> in some such
<hi>Scheme</hi> of <hi>Doctrinals,</hi> as for which <hi>all
these</hi> profess to have a common Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
that while <hi>our Union</hi> cannot as
yet be <hi>so extensive as it ought,</hi> it may be
<hi>as extensive as we can; that the Gospel
be not hindered,</hi> and that <hi>our Ministry</hi>
may be the more successful and profitable to
the promoting of the <hi>common Salvation,</hi>
among those that attend upon it.</p>
            <p>Such <hi>Schemes</hi> or Collections of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi>
reduced into an Order (as <hi>Gold
formed into a Vessel,</hi> whereas Truth, as
it lies in the Holy Scriptures is as <hi>Gold in
the Mass)</hi> may be of use (as they have
always been used in the Church in all
Ages) more distinctly to <hi>inform others</hi>
concerning our Sentiments (tho' the use is
less, that after thorough search and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:96046:13"/>
they can be of to <hi>one self)</hi> provided,
they be avowed to be lookt upon, but as a
<hi>mensura mensurata,</hi> reserving unto the
Scriptures the Honour of being the only
<hi>mensura mensurans;</hi> and so that we only
own them as <hi>agreeable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
And again, that we declare we
take them to be agreeable thereto <hi>in the
main,</hi> or <hi>for substance,</hi> without attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
a <hi>Sacredness</hi> to the <hi>very Words</hi>
of a meer humane Composition; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we cannot attribute to the words used
in the Translation of the Bible it self.
And that <hi>for the things</hi> we believe them
with a <hi>degree of Assent</hi> proportionable to
their <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>less Evidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, through the blessing of God, such
as have used a <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>ingenuous</hi>
freedom with one another, have found an
effectual Expedient to deliver their minds
from <hi>mutual doubt,</hi> concerning each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that because of some different modes
of expressing their Sentiments, they held
very different <hi>Opinions,</hi> which they have
found to be a Mistake on one hand and
the other; and have given and received
satisfaction, they intended nothing that
ought to be reckoned into the <hi>Account</hi> of
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:96046:13"/>
               <hi>Socinian, Pelagian, Popish, Arminian</hi>
or <hi>Antinomian</hi> Errours. That fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and unjust way of making the Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
being justly exploded, <hi>that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shall in some things that touch
not the main Points of difference, say
as some other of these do, must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be of their minds thorough-out.</hi>
VVhich <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Judging</hi> would make
<hi>any Christian</hi> be taken for a <hi>Jew,</hi> a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan,</hi>
or a <hi>Pagan.</hi> There being no
intelligent Christian, but must say many
things that they do.</p>
            <p>But it is to be hoped this <hi>Engine</hi> of the
Devil's is by the mercy of God broken, so
as that the People shall be no more fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from attending to the <hi>Ministry</hi> of such
(be their Denomination what it will) as
use apt and proper methods to awaken, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
and save Souls, by being told they
are <hi>Antinomians</hi> or <hi>Arminians,</hi> &amp;c. It
being upon enquiry found, that persons so
and so charged, by the rash Folly of some
that understand nothing of the difference,
besides the different sound of those odious

not only a <hi>System of Doctrines</hi> (and
those reducible within a little compass) but
of <hi>Precepts</hi> also, not concerning the <hi>Modes
of Worship</hi> only, but <hi>Men's ordinary

given</hi> where he is <hi>sought for,</hi> and <hi>not
affronted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let this be taken for <hi>Christianity</hi>
and avow'd to be so, and seriously endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to be propagated <hi>as such,</hi> and it
will not always be put to vye (but as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
equal Terms) with <hi>Mahometanism,

whatsoever else shall exalt it self into a

            <p>And let whatsoever comes not within

Christian,</hi> be resected and cut off
from it, and so it will appear an entire
self-agreeable thing; and the <hi>Christian
Church</hi> be but <hi>One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While it is not so, it will be the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and design of the most, only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Party.
And if their sense were put into plain

<hi>Division</hi> which (on the one side at least,

            <p>THE last time I spake to you
from these Words, having
largely opened before the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of <hi>[Walking in the Spirit,]</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to shew you how <hi>the Flesh</hi>
here is to be understood, against the
Lusts whereof such walking in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96046:20"/>
Spirit is the prescribed Remedy. In
the General you have been told, that
<hi>Flesh</hi> is here to be taken <hi>morally,</hi> and in
that Latitude, as to signifie <hi>all sorts of
moral Evil,</hi> or the general Depraved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our Corrupt Nature: For
though sometimes <hi>in the moral Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
the Sense is limited (as hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been shewed) to <hi>grosser Sins,</hi> in
contradistinction to <hi>more refined,</hi> as
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 16. yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
also it is so far extended, as to
signifie <hi>all Sins,</hi> as <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11. compar'd
with <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. And in this Context
it is plain the Apostle comprehends
Sins of <hi>both these sorts</hi> under this one
Expression.</p>
            <p>But what particular Evils he more
especially intended here to censure and
caution these <hi>Galatian</hi> Christians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
under <hi>this one Name,</hi> cannot
better be understood than by consulting
this Context it self; in which, tho' we
cannot say we have a full <hi>Enumeration;</hi>
we have yet very many <hi>Instances,</hi> of
the <hi>Carnalities</hi> against which this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
is directed. Some of them <hi>more
gross,</hi> (as we have told you they might
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96046:20"/>
be distinguished) <hi>Adultery, Fornication,
Vncleanness, Lasciviousness, Idolatory,
Witchcraft, Murther, Drunkenness, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellings;</hi>
and <hi>some other</hi> that may seem
<hi>more refined,</hi> not as having <hi>less,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <hi>more subtle</hi> Malignity in them;
such as <hi>Hatred, Vartance, Emulation,
Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Heresies, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyings,</hi>
&amp;c. It may here be thought
strange, that <hi>such Sins as these</hi> should
be animadverted upon in <hi>Christian
Churches,</hi> (as this Epistle is inscribed to
such, the <hi>Churches of Galatia,</hi> Chap. 1.
2.) so soon after the Gospel was come
among them, the Apostle himself
thought it strange; for you find him
wondring at it, <hi>Chap. 1. 5. I marvel
that you are so soon removed from him
that called you into the Grace of Christ,</hi> to
another Gospel. Yea, and after that,
with the Gospel, <hi>they had received</hi> the
Spirit too. For 'tis said, <hi>Chap. 3. 2, 3.
This only would I learn of you, received ye
the Spirit by the Works of the Law, or by
the hearing of Faith? And are you so
foolish, having begun in the Spirit, do you
think to be made perfect by the Flesh?</hi>

sort of Persons and Doctrines they were
that had corrupted and depraved those
Churches; and whereby it will be
the more apprehensible by what kind
of Insinuations they so far prevailed:
And we may collect, in very great part,
what they were, from divers Passages
of this <hi>Epistle</hi> it self; and indeed, <hi>from
this very Context.</hi> Some would have
us think the Persons were <hi>of that Sect
called Gnosticks,</hi> from their pretended
and highly boasted Knowledge. We
have no Evidence that this Sect was so
early known by this Name; but it is
very likely they were that sort of Men
that were afterwards so called: The
Characters here given them in <hi>this</hi>
and the <hi>other Apostolical Epistles</hi> do
much agree with what divers of the
more <hi>Ancient Christian Writers,</hi> and one
<hi>Pagan one, (Plotinus)</hi> say of that Sect:
Which Pagan, an Interpreter, and
great Admirer of his<note n="*" place="margin">Marsil. Ficinus.</note> would sain
have pass for a <hi>Christian,</hi> because living
in a time when the Controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christianity and Paganism was
at the height, he says nothing against
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96046:21"/>
Christianity it self, but speaks very
much against these <hi>Pseudo-Christians,</hi>
whom tho' <hi>that Author</hi> mentions not
by that Name, this his Interpreter
often doth it for him, inserting <hi>[The
Gnosticks]</hi> even when he is but transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
into the Body of the Work it
self.</p>
            <p>But this less concerns us: It is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
out of question, that this sort of
Men very anciently called <hi>Gnosticks,</hi>
did highly vaunt their great <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
A very tempting specious Pretence!
Tho' their sublimer <hi>Notions,</hi> (about the
<hi>Aeons,</hi> &amp;c.) were <hi>Imaginations</hi> only:
<hi>Phansie</hi> and not <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
Knowledge misnamed, or
falsly so called, (as we may borrow
the Apostles Expression, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 20.
tho' <hi>those Inventions</hi> were later) and
could only serve to fill the Minds of
their <hi>Pros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lytes</hi> with Wind and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>But their Doctrines upon which the
Apostle animadverts in <hi>this Epistle,</hi> we
may collect from the manifest Scope
and Design of it; and that was to
assert <hi>Justification by Faith without the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96046:22"/>
works of the Law,</hi> which they greatly
perverted; and <hi>Sanctification by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ,</hi> or the Doctrine of the
<hi>New Creature,</hi> which they even quite
subverted.</p>
            <p>With which false Doctrines they
conioyned a most impurely vicious <hi>Life</hi>
and <hi>Practice;</hi> falling in much with the
<hi>Jews</hi> in their corrupt Doctrines, and with
the <hi>Pagans</hi> in their Licentious Practice.
Which must be equally tempting to
carnal Minds.</p>
            <p>And this may make it appear less
strange, that all these sorts of Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that are here mentioned in this
Context from <hi>ver.</hi> 15 to the <hi>21st.</hi> should,
in reference to the same sort of Men,
be so put together.</p>
            <p>For it is evident they were partly
a <hi>Judaizing,</hi> and partly a <hi>Paganizing
sort of Christians;</hi> as (for ends of
their own) they affected to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
They held it lawful for <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
to joyn with <hi>Pagans</hi> in their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities
of Worship, which they
were wont to Celebrate in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of their Idols. It is notorious how
gross Impurities and Immoralities were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96046:22"/>
in those days incorporated into the
<hi>Paganish Worship;</hi> such as made it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
reasonable that Idolatry should
have in conjunction with it <hi>Fornication,</hi>
and <hi>Adultery, Vncleanness</hi> and <hi>Lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viousn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Witchcraft,</hi> it was not unaccountable,

Rites</hi> and <hi>Diabolical Incantations</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to have been intermingled with
the <hi>Sacra</hi> of the <hi>Pagans.</hi> And for which
these <hi>(misnamed) Christians</hi> might have
the greater kindness also, for the sake
of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> the Father of their
<hi>Sect,</hi> by whom the Affectation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was transmitted to some of his <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
Followers, that thought it a glorious

            </p>
            <p>Nor is it alien from this purpose to
take notice, that those Diabolical Rites
are said to have obtained among the
<hi>Paganish Idolaters</hi> of drinking the warm
Blood of their Sacrifices, and of eating
things strangled with the Blood in
them, upon the Imagination that in
their so doing, they did partake of the
very Spirit of their Gods whom they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96046:23"/>
worshipped; and 'tis not altogether
unsupposable that rhe Devil might, in
some unusual manner, enter into them
at those times, more violently agitating
their Blood and other Humours; in
the higher Ferments whereof, if by the
directer Influence of the great Enemy
of Mankind Quarrels and <hi>Murders</hi> (as
was not unlikely) should also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ensue, it could not but heighten
the Sport and Triumphs of Hell.</p>
            <p>And that the <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi>
and <hi>Elders, Acts</hi> 15. might have such
a Reference, prohibiting these things
conjunctly, <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>Fornication,</hi>
and <hi>things strangled,</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi> that
they should by no means mingle with
the Pagans in these Horrid Rites, a
learned Modern Writer of our own hath
rendred very probable<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> de Riti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Hebrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum.</note>. And hereto
those vehement Dehortations of the
Apostle must answerably be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to refer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating
to them, that they <hi>could
not have fellowship with the Lord's Table,
and the Table of Devils.</hi> And I would
not, says he, <hi>that you should have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with Devils.</hi> For tho' he did
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96046:23"/>
not judge it unlawful to eat of the <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytha,</hi>
i. e. things offered to Idols, being
<hi>sold in the Shambles,</hi> he yet most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
protests against their presuming
to mingle and partake in the horrid
Diabolical Rites, and impure Practices
that were wont to be used at their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals
in the Idols Temples.</p>
            <p>All thoughts of being by their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
obliged and enabled unto strict
Purity and Holiness of Heart and Life,
were out of Doors with these Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and endeavoured to be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
in such as they could work to a
compliance with them: Whereof the
Apostle seemed deeply apprehensive,
when he so earnestly inculcates, that
<hi>in Christ Jesus</hi> (or in the <hi>Christian state)
neither Circumcision nor Vncircumcision</hi>
were of any avail, <hi>but a new Creature,</hi>
and <hi>Faith working by love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it must seem of all things the most
unaccountable and incongruous, that
Men of so profligate <hi>Sentiments</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,</hi>
should be for introducing a <hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by the works of the Law, in opposition
to that by the Faith of Christ.</hi> 'Tis manifest
they hated the holy Design of Christian
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96046:24"/>
Religion, which they profess'd; and
profess'd it, that they might have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opportunity to undermine it. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
(not opening at once all the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana</hi>
of their way) they carry answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
to persons and oc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>sions as they
occurr'd; and as the Apostle was all
things to all, that he might <hi>save some,</hi>
so were they, that they might pervert
and <hi>destroy.</hi> To the <hi>Christian Jews</hi>
one thing, to the <hi>Christian Gentiles</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In this their Doctrine they did
most plausibly <hi>Judaize,</hi> in their impure
Practices they verged more to Paganism.
Pretending to Christian Converts from
among <hi>them,</hi> that Christ never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to tie them to strict Severities, or
hold them under an uneasie Bondage;
whereto the Apostle seems to refer,
<hi>Chap. 5. 13. Ye have been called</hi> (he
grants) <hi>to liberty, but use not</hi> (saith he)
<hi>your liberty for an occasion to the flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we must suppose that they
differently apply'd themselves to such as
they design'd to make their Proselytes,
endeavouring to accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the one of these to one sort of
Men, and to another sort in the other. In
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96046:24"/>
dealing with the <hi>Jewish Christians</hi> they
not only deny'd the <hi>Doctrine of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by Faith,</hi> (opposing thereto that
of <hi>Justification by the works of the Law)</hi>
but calumniated it too, as if it tended
to infer a liberty to sin, and make <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
subservient to wickedness,
whereof they knew <hi>their own</hi> to be
more guilty. A piece of monstrous
Impudence (but usual with Men of such
Foreheads) to endeavour the averting
that Charge from themselves, to
which they were most manifestly lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by <hi>first</hi> charging it on the Innocent.</p>
            <p>Hereto the Apostle hath manifest
reference, when having <hi>first</hi> asserted
against them <hi>Justification by Faith only,</hi>
Gal. 2. 16. <hi>Knowing that a man is not
justified by the works of the Law, but by
the Faith of Jesus Christ, even we have
believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be
justified by the Faith of Christ, and not by
the works of the Law; for by the works of
the Law shall no fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh be justified.</hi> He
<hi>then</hi> vindicates the Assertion against
their Imputation, that it made Christ
a Patron to Men's Sins; <hi>If</hi> (saith he)
<hi>while we seek to be justified by Christ, we
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96046:25"/>
our selves also are found sinners. Is Christ
therefore the minister of sin? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.
For if I build again the things that
I destroyed, I make my self a Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor:
For I through the Law am dead to
the Law, that I might live unto God. I am
crucified with Christ,</hi> and am in and with
him dead unto all Sin, so as not to be
under the Dominion of any; and
Death never more had Dominion over
him, when he had once died. And
whereas they thus objecting against
the Doctrine of Justification by Faith
in Christ, that it ministred unto sin, or
<hi>made Christ a Minister</hi> thereunto, were
liable to have the Objection retorted
upon them, being a sort of Men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so very infamously wicked; for
this they had a double <hi>Salvo,</hi> both of
which the Apostle doth <hi>industriously</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sute.
That is, from the <hi>two parts of
the Law</hi> given by <hi>Moses,</hi> and the two
sorts of the <hi>Works of the Law</hi> enjoyned
thereby, that is the <hi>Moral,</hi> and the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
or <hi>Ceremonial part.</hi> In reference to
the <hi>former,</hi> they fall in with those <hi>Jewish
Conceits</hi> of the <hi>Merit of their good
Works, done from the Principle of Free-will:</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:96046:25"/>
And that in order to their <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification</hi>
this Merit was to be measured
<hi>by the Preponderation of their good works
to their bad</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">See at large to this purpose <hi>Smith's Select Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</note>; and that it was possible
that <hi>one good Work</hi> in some cases might
turn the Scale: That is, if they were
equal before. Now <hi>this</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs
to, by shewing <hi>that they that were
under the Law were under a Curse:</hi> For
that if they <hi>continued not in all things
written in the Law to do them,</hi> All they
did was nothing, as you may see,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 3. of this Epistle, <hi>ver.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>And then as to the <hi>Ritual</hi> or <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
part,</hi> because their Sacrifices were
in great part expiatory of Sin, and
divers of their other Performances car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
a great shew of Sanctity and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
in them: Which their Expiatory
Sacrifices could only be, as they were
representative of the <hi>One Propitiation;</hi>
and their other Observances were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to their Sanctity, if the thing
they were designed to signifie, did not
accompany the Sign. <hi>They</hi> imagin'd
they were not to signify it's Presence,
but to supply it's Absence. This No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did obtain even with the stricter
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96046:26"/>
sort of them, <hi>the Pharisees themselves,</hi>
who thereupon made very light of the
<hi>weightier matters of the Law,</hi> reckoning
that tho' they were guilty of many
Immoralilies in Practice, their exact
observance of the Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
enjoyned by <hi>Moses,</hi> would go far
to make an amends; and that their
<hi>Praying Tythe of Mint, Annis</hi> and
<hi>Cummin,</hi> would serve in stead of
<hi>Judgment, Faith, Mercy,</hi> and the <hi>love
of God,</hi> which they are said to pass
over as very light and small matters.
See <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 23. compared with
<hi>Luke</hi> 11. 42. And herein the <hi>Apostle</hi>
Contests with these <hi>Galatian</hi> Christians,
not only with Vehemency, but with
some kind of Wonder, that when Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
Light had come among them, and
that <hi>having known God, or rather been
known of him,</hi> as <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 9. they should
attribute any thing to so beggarly Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
as these were; that is, <hi>being
circumcised,</hi> and <hi>keeping Days,</hi> and
<hi>Months,</hi> and <hi>Years,</hi> &amp;c. the things
whereon they laid so great stress. And
because they did so, he tells them in
that <hi>4th</hi> Chapter, <hi>That he was afraid
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96046:26"/>
that he had bestowed labour in vain among
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Summ therefore, he makes it his
business to evidence to them, that both
<hi>their Justification</hi> and <hi>their Sanctification</hi>
must be conjoyned and arise together
out of one and the same Root, <hi>Christ
himself,</hi> and by Faith in him (without
the <hi>Works of the Law)</hi> as that which
must vitally unite them with him, and
that thereby they should become actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
interested in all his Fulness; that
<hi>Fulness of Righteousness</hi> which was to
be found only in him, and no where
but in him; and withall, <hi>in that fulness
of Spirit and Life, and holy Influence,</hi>
which also was only in him; so as that
the Soul being united by this Faith
with Christ, must presently <hi>die to Sin</hi>
and <hi>love to God, Chap.</hi> 2. 19, 20. And
at the same time when he delivered a
Man from the Law <hi>as dead to it,</hi> he
became to him a continual living
Spring of all the Duty, which God
did by his Holy Rule require and call
for, and render the whole Life of such
a Man a Life of Devotedness to God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:96046:27"/>
And 'tis here by the way worth the
while to observe how the Apostle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
expounds that Phrase of being
<hi>dead to the Law by being delivered from it,</hi>
Rom. 7. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And no man
can be said to be <hi>delivered</hi> from any
thing, as it is a <hi>good,</hi> or an advantage
to him, but as it is an <hi>evil,</hi> and doth
him hurt. And the Law hurts no man
as a <hi>Rule of life.</hi> But as <hi>to one stated
under the full Power of it,</hi> 'tis a Barr
against that great Blessing of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 13, 14. which by it's yet
abiding Curse it keeps off from him,
hereby occasioning his continuance in
sin, and then condemning him for it.
Whereupon how clear is the Current
of the Discourse in these Words, <hi>viz.
By the Law I am dead to the Law, that I
might live to God; I am crucify'd with
Christ, yet I live,</hi> q. d. The Law it
self hath slain me, and killed all my
Hopes and Expectations from it: The
same Law that slew Christ, hath slain
me. <hi>I am crucify'd with him;</hi> which
supposes his being in him by that
Faith by which he was to live ever
after. In this Faith stood his Marriage
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96046:27"/>
to Christ, who succeeds into the room
of the Law, as the case is stated, <hi>Rom.
7. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</hi> They that were settled,
in reference to each other, in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
state,</hi> as <hi>the Law</hi> and <hi>the Sinner</hi>
were; upon the death of the one
(which soever it be) the Relation
ceases, and so the Obligation which
depended upon that Relation. And
thereupon, says he, The Law it self
having given me my deaths wound,
and killed me <hi>as to it,</hi> in the Article
of Dying, I joyn my self to Christ,
and yield to be <hi>crucified with him,</hi> but
therein acquire with him a New Life.
<hi>Nevertheless I live;</hi> And how? <hi>Not
I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life
that I live in the flesh, is by Faith in the
Son of God, who hath loved me, and given
himself for me.</hi> And this Life I now
thus live, is a Life of pure and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
devotedness to God; terminated
upon his Interest and Glory as the <hi>End
of it,</hi> governed by his <hi>declared Will,</hi>
as the <hi>Rule of it.</hi> i. e. In summe, <hi>'tis
an holy Life,</hi> or (as before) <hi>'tis a living
to God.</hi> Whereupon he so copiously
distinguishes, <hi>Ch.</hi> 3. between <hi>Jews</hi> and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96046:28"/>
               <hi>Jews,</hi> those that were <hi>born after the
Flesh,</hi> and <hi>those born of the Spirit,</hi> the
Sons of the <hi>Bond-woman,</hi> and <hi>of the Free,</hi>
(as he allegorically speaks,) signifying
the <hi>latter</hi> only <hi>born into this new State of
life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all which he shews the connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be most necessary and inviolable,
between <hi>being justified by Faith in Christ,</hi>
and <hi>a life of Holiness;</hi> So little oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
were these <hi>to one another,</hi> that
<hi>one and the same Faith</hi> was to infer
<hi>both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now that the <hi>large extent</hi> of this
<hi>Holiness of Life,</hi> might more fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
the Apostle signifies, that it
must not only exclude <hi>those grosser
lusts and works of the flesh,</hi> but also
such, as because they might seem some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more refined, might be reckoned
by some <hi>less Criminal,</hi> he therefore inserts
divers of this other kind also: And the
state of the Case did equally require
it. For it appears (as it might well be
supposed) that so far as any were
tainted with the <hi>false Notions,</hi> and
with inclinations to the <hi>impure practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
before mentioned, they were filled
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96046:28"/>
with animosities, with wrath, envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and hatred towards them that
had not received the taint; and they
might have too much place with <hi>these</hi>
back again towards <hi>them.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
there could not but be very
great and high Ferments in these
Churches. Nothing therefore could
be more requisite, or seasonable, than
that several Instances of this sort of
Carnality, should be put into <hi>this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue,</hi>
viz. <hi>hatred,</hi> variance, emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
wrath, strise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For they
were not to be thought (as was said)
more refined, as having <hi>less,</hi> but a
<hi>more subtle</hi> Energy, or <hi>penetrative</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of malignity in them. Nor indeed
hath <hi>Christianity,</hi> and the <hi>Christian
Church</hi> suffered more by any sort of
Evils, than by those of this sort.
<hi>Others</hi> destroy <hi>particular Persons: These,</hi>
besides their doing so, do <hi>more directly</hi>
hurt the Community, and tend to
wast and destroy the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as to <hi>those grosser Carnalities</hi>
mentioned in this Context, I did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
say somewhat briefly, and so I
did as to that which seems the <hi>central
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96046:29"/>
one</hi> among those of <hi>this latter sort,
viz.</hi> that of <hi>Heresie:</hi> Which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
<hi>according to what it doth import
in it self,</hi> and did design also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it in <hi>this its Concomitancy,</hi> viz.
of the things here mentioned in so
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear conjunction, and that are of near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
affinity with it, <hi>hatred. envyings,</hi>
and the like. I have indeed been since
in some suspence whether I should pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
that intention or no; But upon
serious consideration, and solemn look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up to Heaven for direction, I
have determined not to let <hi>this sort of
Carnality</hi> pass without just Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
For I consider that I speak to a
<hi>Christian Assembly,</hi> who must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
all to profess equal, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
reverence to the Word of God,
as to a Revelation come down from
Heaven, for our Direction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
thither: And therefore none dare,
upon serious thoughts, allow in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
any kind of regret or disgust,
as to so material and important a part
of <hi>this holy Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d.</hi> We are assured <hi>the

ones,</hi> who it must therefore he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
will walk or deal uprightly in their
attendance thereunto. And I cannot
but hope that God will graciously help
us to speak, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d hear with that Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness
and Integrity of Heart that
<hi>this word of his</hi> may do good to some,
without doing hurt to any.</p>
            <p>In speaking therefore to <hi>this sort of
Carnality,</hi> (for we must mention it by
such a Term as the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> hath
thought fit to be put upon it) I shall
<hi>First</hi> note to you some previous things
more generally. Then shall, <hi>Secondly,</hi> let
you see what Appearances there may
be of it in such a Case as the <hi>Apostles</hi>
present Discourse hath reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>First, It will be of use to us, more
generally, to note these few things:</p>
            <p>1. That the several Expressions of it
which we find in this Context, in clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
Connection with <hi>Heresie,</hi> as it were
guarding it before and behind, <hi>viz.
Hatred, Variance, Emulation, Wrath,
Strife, Seditions, Envyings,</hi> do all note
but <hi>one radical Evil,</hi> and do all agree in
<hi>one root:</hi> Whereupon it will be the less
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96046:30"/>
needful to insist upon them severally, or
to give you the <hi>Criticism</hi> of each Word
by it self; which it were a great deal
more easie to do, than it will be useful,
or of any avail to us. What I shall say
therefore will be more general; but will
however give you the occasion of cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Eye upon the Particulars,
whereby you will have the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
account of <hi>that Carnality,</hi> which
is here referr'd to by the <hi>Apostle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This is needful to be noted too,
that this <hi>Precept</hi> of the Apostle consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<hi>as a prescription against fulfilling
the lusts of the Flesh,</hi> has more <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and direct reference</hi> to this <hi>sort of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality.</hi>
This is plain, if you will but
again peruse the Words as they lie in
their closest connexion. For when he
had said in the <hi>14th</hi> Verse, That <hi>all the
Law is fulfilled in this one word, even in
this, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy
self,</hi> (most of all, no doubt, ones <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Neighbour)</hi> he adds, <hi>But if you bite
and devour one another, take heed ye be not
devoured one of another.</hi> Then immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come in the Words of the Text,
<hi>This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96046:30"/>
you shall not fulfil the lusts of the Flesh:
q. d.</hi> The Lust of the Flesh will be
working <hi>this way,</hi> putting you upon
<hi>biting and devouring one another.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as Sentiments begin to differ,
and Minds are divided, <hi>Inclinations</hi> will
carry one <hi>this way,</hi> and another <hi>that;</hi>
and then you will be too prone to
be <hi>at biting,</hi> and be ready to fall to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
one another:</hi> Now I have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Remedy to prescribe you against
<hi>both</hi> than this, <hi>Walk in the Spirit, and
you shall not fulfill the Lusts of the Flesh.</hi>
I should have been a very unfaithful
Interpreter of this Context to you, if I
had not taken notice of <hi>this so immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Connexion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. This is further ro be noted, That
this sort of <hi>Carnality</hi> that lies in <hi>Strifes,</hi>
in <hi>Emulations,</hi> in <hi>Envyings,</hi> in <hi>Hatred,</hi>
&amp;c. may come to have it's occasion of
being exercised, of working, lusting, and
exerting it's self <hi>about the Doctrines of
the Gospel:</hi> Than which nothing is
more evident, in that you find that these
things are put in Connexion with <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,</hi>
which must be understood to be
a Corruption of <hi>Gospel-Doctrine.</hi> Very
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96046:31"/>
true indeed it is, that that Word <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,</hi>
among the more <hi>ancient Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>
was used in a more gentle, and
no way infamous Sense, signifying on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this or that <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct</hi> of <hi>Philosophers:</hi> But
the Word coming to be borrowed and
transferred by <hi>Sacred Writers</hi> into the
Holy Scriptures, there it is mostly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in <hi>a very ill Sense,</hi> (tho' not always)
as signifying <hi>Error</hi> or <hi>Corruption</hi> in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
of a very high and destructive
Nature, as <hi>Tit. 3. 10, 11. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 1. For
tho' all <hi>Heresie</hi> be <hi>Error,</hi> or carry <hi>Error</hi>
in it. yet all <hi>Error</hi> is not <hi>Heresie;</hi> that
must be such Error as strikes at the
Root, and is conjunct with <hi>Heart dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection</hi>
and <hi>Malignity,</hi> (as was noted
the last time) standing in opposition to
<hi>Faith,</hi> which is not a meerly Mental
thing, but lies very principally in the
Heart. <hi>Doctrinal matters</hi> are however
here referr'd unto, even in the <hi>very
Notion of Heresie,</hi> and therefore about
<hi>those</hi> matters these <hi>Carnalities</hi> may have
place. For when the several Passions
here mentioned are raised, and do tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuate
in the Breasts of this and that
particular Person, they soon and easily
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96046:31"/>
spread and propagate themselves to
<hi>others,</hi> so as to insect the Community.
And then it comes to the forming of
it into Parties, or dividing it <hi>into two
sides,</hi> as the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (which we
translate <hi>Seditions)</hi> signifies; the one
stated and posited as in an hostile Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
against the other, till at length the
matter arrive to that height and pitch
of contumacious and fixed Obstinacy,
as in matters so important as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Discourse reflects upon, will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
the <hi>Notion</hi> of Heresies, <hi>viz.</hi> on
<hi>one side,</hi> at least; not, perhaps, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>great Faultiness</hi> on the other, which
comes next to be noted.</p>
            <p>4. As <hi>such Carnalitie</hi> may have place
and exercise about Gospel-Doctrine, so
it is very possible it may shew it's self
on both sides, even on their part who
have the <hi>Truth</hi> with them, as well as
on theirs who oppose it, and make it
their business to propagate the contrary
Error or false Doctrine: The very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of Truth it self may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with such Carnalities, such
Strife, Wrath, Malice, Envy, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
the Guilt between the divided
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96046:32"/>
Parties, and leaves neither side inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
            <p>I am, you know, by meer Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
in the Series and Tract of a
Discourse long continued upon this
Context, led to say what I now do;
and I have therefore the more hope,
that, through the Blessing of God, it
may be of some use to us. But this
comes most directly under our notice;
and let it be noted, that whereas in <hi>such
Contests</hi> both sides are wont to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
they are in the right; neither the
one nor the other may be over-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
or careless of not being in the
wrong, in what may be of equal or
greater importance than the matters
themselves, disputed among them that
agree in the Substantials of Religion,
(or <hi>that hold the Head)</hi> can be. Let us I
say, deeply consider it, that such sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Carnality may have place, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
not only about Religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments,
but even on that side,
where the Truth lies; which is from
hence evident, that the Apostle imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
before the Text, as I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
says, <hi>If you bite and devour</hi> one
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96046:32"/>
another, <hi>take heed that ye be not bitten
and consumed</hi> one of another. A great
aptitude he therefore observed there
was, to be biting on both sides, even
where the Truth lay, and where it lay
not.</p>
            <p>For we are here further to observe,
that whereas our <hi>Apostle</hi> sadly considered
that many among these <hi>Christians of
Galatia</hi> were lapsed, and fall'n from
the Purity and Sincerity of Religion;
he apprehended too, that they who
were not so fallen, took not the best
course for the recovery of them that
were. Which that Admonition of his
must mean, <hi>Chap. 6. 1, 2. Brethren, if
a man be overtaken with a fault, ye which
are Spiritual, restore such an one in the
Spirit of meekness, considering thy self,
lest thou also be tempted. Bear ye one
anothers Burdens, and so fulfil the Law
of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seems he reckoned that the
sounder part among them, and that
ought (and 'tis like thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
to be more <hi>Spiritual,</hi> while they
shewed not more of a <hi>Spirit of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
towards the lapsed, were not so
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96046:33"/>
Spiritual as they should be, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
more <hi>Carnality</hi> than became
them, more Wrath and Bitterness of
Spirit than could comport with the
<hi>Law of Christ.</hi> They will be little aw'd
by this, and be apt for all this to indulge
their own furious Passions, that think <hi>he
hath no Law.</hi> But tho' one were never so
sure he hath the Truth on his side, 'tis
in it self a dreadful thing, to whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shall allow himself the liberty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
to think of it: For what must
we conceive of <hi>such Truth,</hi> that is to be
defended in some cases, I say, that in
some cases ought to be so? We must
surely conceive of it as <hi>a Divine, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
thing,</hi> an <hi>Heaven-born thing, a thing
of Heavenly descent,</hi> part of a Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
immediately come forth from the
very Bosom of God; so is the whole
Gospel-revelation to be look'd upon.
Now here is <hi>Carnality that lusts;</hi> such a
kind of <hi>Carnality</hi> as the Context speaks
of, <hi>Wrath, Strife, Hatred,</hi> &amp;c. Here is
such Carnality, lusting, actually <hi>lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
seeking Prey, ravening for Food:
And what doth it feed upon? No
meaner thing than Divine Truth!
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96046:33"/>
Evangelical Doctrines! Monstrous
Thought! Consider, I beseech you, my
Friends, what this comes to? The
feeding an impure <hi>Lust</hi> upon Sacred
things, or upon that which is Divine!
I must have my Lust satisfy'd, says the
proud, contentious Spirit: Wrath
burns, Anger boils; Sacred things are
not spared, but fall'n upon, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
Food of Lust. It will be fed,
they are not forborn. All Reverence of
God is forgotten, Heaven is ravag'd,
the most Sacred Mysteries of God's own
Kingdom are violated, and torn this
way, and that (O horrid thing!) by
Harpies, Vultures, by most fierce and
furious Lusts. And if a Man would
know, recognize, take knowledge of
the most deeply inward Sensations and
Intention of his own Heart, thus it
is, I must now apply my Thoughts,
bend my Mind, to consider a Revelation
come from Heaven; what? for the end
for which it was given, to enlighten,
purify, quicken my Soul towards God,
renew and form<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it for God, to serve
and enjoy him? no, but on purpose
to feed, to gratifie a Lust! We can
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96046:34"/>
(too often) make neither better nor
worse of it, but just so it is.</p>
            <p>These things being premised, I would
now go on a little more particularly to
shew you wherein <hi>Carnality</hi> may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
exerting it self, even about <hi>such
things,</hi> or what will be manifest Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of such a Carnality, as is here
referr'd unto, acting about, or in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the things of God, the most
sacred and important Truths and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of his Gospel.</p>
            <p>1. First, When in comparison of
some less things, wherein we find oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
or pretence to differ, little Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
is made of the incomparably
greater things, wherein all serious
Christians are agreed, and wherein
they really cannot but be agreed. Let
it be considered whether pains be not
taken to devise some matter or other
to contend about: (that shews a great
Disposition!) And then having found
out some minuter things about which
to differ, our Differences, as little as
they are, quite swallow up our Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
The whole Gospel signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
(tho' full of the most glorious
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96046:34"/>
Wonders) in comparison of some
Punctilio's, either that we have invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or that it may be doubted whether
there be any thing in them or nothing.
Here is some <hi>Mystery</hi> in all this! A <hi>Lust</hi>
is to be gratify'd; an <hi>Appetite to contend.
This</hi> winds and wriggles, this way and
that, loath to appear but under some
specious Disguise of <hi>Zeal for Truth, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation</hi>
against <hi>False Doctrine,</hi> or the
like; but it bewrays it self, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,
shews it's ugly Serpentine
Head. For if the thing chosen out to
be the matter of Contest be thought
worth so much, when it is manifestly
either in comparison, little, or nothing
but a Figment, Why are not <hi>the things</hi>
on all hands most <hi>confessedly great,</hi> and
most evident, more highly esteemed,
lov'd, relished, and with Gust and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
fed upon? Why do not the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
things</hi> signifie more to <hi>unite</hi> us in <hi>Love</hi>
and <hi>Communion</hi> with all that agree with
us in them, than the <hi>lesser things</hi> to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide</hi>
us, about which we <hi>disagree?</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Disagreements were in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
vastly great between the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
Christians</hi> of these <hi>Galatian
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96046:35"/>
Churches,</hi> and <hi>that horrid S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct</hi> that the
<hi>Aopstles Discourse</hi> has manifest reference
unto. Blessed be God there are not
such Disagreements amongst us. But
while there is <hi>less</hi> Taint of Error <hi>in our
Minds,</hi> (as to these things) are we nor
concern'd to take heed there be not <hi>as
great</hi> a Taint of <hi>this vicious Carnality in
our Hearts?</hi> It speaks <hi>too much</hi> of it;
when having devised a difference, we
are prone to overlook and make little
account of the great things wherein
we are intirely and most professedly
agreed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If we consider the things which the</hi>
Doctrinal part <hi>of</hi> this Epistle <hi>doth more
expresly refer to, as I have noted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
how great things</hi> in reference
hereto <hi>are we fully agreed in? We are
all agreed, that</hi> a Sinner, an Apostale
lapsed Creature, can never be saved and
brought to a blessed state, but he must <hi>be
justified,</hi> and he must <hi>be sanctified:</hi> He
must be justified, <hi>to make his</hi> state safe;
He must be sanctified, <hi>to make the</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of his Spirit good, capable of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God in this World, and of final
eternal Blessedness with him in the other.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96046:35"/>
               <hi>We are agreed,</hi> that such Justification
and such Sanctification are both the effects:
<hi>of most absolutely free</hi> and <hi>Sovereign
Grace,</hi> that none could be ever justified,
but by freest Grace; that none can ever be
sanctified but by freest Grace, most abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
and most Soveraignly free. <hi>We are
agreed,</hi> That the highest Perfection of
Sanctification that can ever possibly be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
unto, signifies nothing at all to
<hi>deserve,</hi> to <hi>procure by Merit</hi> our <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
We are agreed,</hi> that both, at
they are from the most free and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Grace, so do come <hi>through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
of Jesus Christ,</hi> the alone Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
between God and Man: That the
<hi>Righteousness</hi> is intirely and only <hi>Christs,</hi>
by which we are justified: That the <hi>Spirit</hi>
is most entirely and only <hi>Christs, by
which we are sanctified; according to
that in</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Such as are
mentioned there were before the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
and vilest of Sinners,</hi> Fornicators,
Adulterers, Idolaters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And such
<hi>(saith the Apostle)</hi> were some of you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified;
but ye are justified in the Name of the
Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96046:36"/>
               <hi>You cannot but be in all these agreed.
We are agreed,</hi> that whoever does sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,
Evangelically believe in God
through Christ, receive Christ, is united
with him, or is in him; who doth by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Repentance turn to God, whose
Heart is won to love him in Truth as his
highest and best Good, who is conformed to
the Image of his Son; <hi>and who having
been</hi> made willing in the day of his Power,
<hi>doth now render a</hi> sincere Obedience to
him; every such one is in a <hi>safe state,</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with God, has found Grace in his Eyes.</p>
            <p>For no Words of Scripture can be
plainer, than that they that <hi>believe on
Christ shall not perish, but have everlasting
Life,</hi> John 3. 16. Yea, that they <hi>have
it,</hi> ver. 36. <hi>That Life</hi> is begun with
them, which is never to end, or which
is in the sure way to be continued till it
<hi>become everlasting.</hi> That <hi>they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and turn from all their transgressions,
their Iniquities shall not be their ruine,</hi>
Ezek. 18. 30. That <hi>God hath prepared
the things which Eye hath not seen—for
them that love him,</hi> and will give them
the <hi>Crown of Life</hi> according to his <hi>own
Promise,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 9. Jam. 1. 12. That
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96046:36"/>
Christ <hi>doth become the Author of eternal
Salvation to them that obey them,</hi> Heb. 5. 9.
<hi>That there is no Condemnation to them
that are in Christ, that walk not after the
Flesh, but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 1.
<hi>That</hi> it must turn wholly <hi>to the praise
of the glory of his Grace, that God makes
them accepted in the beloved,</hi> Eph. 1. 6.
We do all agree, <hi>That they that do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
believe, they that never repent, they
that never love God, they that are never
brought to obey him, that live in Enmity
and Rebellion against him to the last breath,
must needs be in a lost state, are never
justified, never accepted with God, are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto coming,</hi> and <hi>abiding Wrath,</hi>
and remain under Condemnation,
<hi>John 3. 16, 36. Luke 13. 3. Col.</hi> 3. 6.
We agree, <hi>That such Faith, such Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
such Love to God, such Obedience,
even in the most entire Sincerity, are not
to be considered at all, as any cause of such
a Persons Acceptance with God: They do
characterize the accepted person, but they
cause it not, they deserve nothing; nay,
they could not, if they were perfect. No in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Work of the Holy Ghost, tho' in
this our present state, it were most absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96046:37"/>
perfect, so as to exclude every thing of
sin, could be any part of that righteousness
that must justifie us before God.</hi> To sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that it could, would be manifestly
to confound the <hi>Offices</hi> of the <hi>Redeemer,</hi>
and of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> It was <hi>Christ</hi>
that was to merit for us; the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>
was never to merit for us. It was not
the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> that died for us, nor can
his Operations or Productions in us
have any <hi>causative Influence</hi> to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting
the justified and accepted state of
any Person before God. They were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meant for that purpose, nor have
any aptitude or accommodateness
thereunto. They cannot make us <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to have sinn'd;</hi> nor can at one for
<hi>our having done so.</hi> We cannot but be
agreed in this, for 'tis plain, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
it's own Evidence in it self: <hi>i. e.</hi>
Suppose we a Person, as soon as he is
converted, made perfectly free from
Sin, that very moment, by some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
powerful Work of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost on his Soul, how shall that
expiate for his having been a Sinner?
Now where there are so great things
wherein we agree, and we make little
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96046:37"/>
of them; things that should raise up
our Souls, and awaken all our Powers
unto highest Acts of <hi>Love, Gratitude</hi>
and <hi>Praise</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and
fill us with wonder and pleasure as oft
as we think of them; an Indisposition
of Mind to take notice of, and consider
such things, so as to improve and use
them to the great purposes of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Life, as Incentives to the love of
God, an entire devoting of our selves
to him, vigorous and diligent serving
of him, and walking holily and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
with him in our daily course;
through a greater Disposition to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
about we well know not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
too plainly shews much of that <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Disaffection,</hi> which the Apostle doth
here animadvert upon. There are other
things belonging to <hi>this same purpose</hi>
that I find I cannot reach to at this
time.</p>

and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Have begun to shew you by what
Indications much Carnality may
appear, and show it self in and about
Spiritual matters. As, (for instance) in
the <hi>controverting,</hi> yea, even in the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending</hi>
the <hi>Truths of the Gospel,</hi> and
intend now to proceed. You have heard</p>
            <p>It does so, 1. When Christians, who
are very far agreed in the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
things, make little of the things
wherein they are agreed, tho' never so
great; in comparison of the much less
things wherein they differ, As all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96046:38"/>
Christians must be understood
to agree in far greater things than it is
possible for them to differ in. I lately
mentioned to you sundry great Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that I cannot doubt to be very
common with serious and intelligent
Christians; which I shall not now stay
to repeat, but add,</p>
            <p>2. Such Carnality shows it's self,
<hi>when there is too much aptness to lay
greater stress than is needful upon some
unscriptural Words</hi> in delivering <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-doctrine.</hi>
Here we may take Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality
as the Apostle doth, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 3.
While there are divisions among you, are
you not carnal, and walk</hi> (or act) <hi>as Men?</hi>
There is more of the <hi>Man</hi> in it than of
the <hi>Christian.</hi> When we can make a
shift to divide about a Word, and
that (in the present Use of it) devised
only by Man. When Words that are
meerly of <hi>Humane Stamp,</hi> and used in
no such Sence, or to no such purpose in
Scripture; however they may be sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant,
yet too great a stress and
weight is laid upon them, either by too
stiffly adhering to them on the one
hand, or too vehemently decrying them
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96046:39"/>
on the other hand; while (perhaps,
and it is a certain and a known case)
the meaning may be the same on both
sides, and would be so, or would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be so, if such and such Words
were waved, and others more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
were chosen and used in the
room of them. It's true, we are not
to think (and no Man of Sense can)
that we are obliged never to use other
Words in such matters, but such as the
<hi>Translators of the Bible</hi> have hit on in
their Version of it, as if that must <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
those Words,</hi> and leave all other
under a Profane Character: But if it
appear that any Word of a doubtful
signification, is misunderstood by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
creates offence, and through some
fixed, immovable Prejudice, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possession
that some other Notion of it
hath obtained in the minds of many,
it will always be otherwise under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by them than we intend, let it
rather go for a <hi>Nehushtan,</hi> than that the
Peace of the Church should be broken,
and Men's minds be disturbed and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted
by it. This is the Case, when
any such Words that might be arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96046:39"/>
used or laid aside, are made <hi>so
necessary,</hi> or <hi>so destructive,</hi> as if <hi>all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
were <hi>saved</hi> or <hi>lost</hi> by them. When
one so cries up such a Word, as if he
would say, <hi>The Heavens must fall if I
have not my Word.</hi> And another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries
it as much, as if he said, <hi>They must
fall if it be admitted, or if I have not
mine.</hi> Sure there must be in this Case
that forbidden <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of which the
<hi>Apostle</hi> speaks in that 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 4. which
they are usually most apt to be guilty
of, that are also guilty of what is put
in Conjunction therewith, <hi>perverse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putings
of men of corrupt minds;</hi> with
these falls in this <hi>strife of words:</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that be to be understood <hi>objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
or <hi>instrumentally, Strife about words,</hi>
or <hi>wordy strifes,</hi> I shall not here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.
But that whole Context is
worth our considering, <hi>ver. 3, 4, 5.
If any man teach otherwise,</hi> do <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
teach other, or <hi>alien</hi> things, or
after another or <hi>alien</hi> manner, <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
not to the words of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and the Doctrine which is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Godliness: 4. He is proud, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing, but doting about Questions,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96046:40"/>
and strife of Words, whereof cometh En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
Strife, Railings, Evil Surmisings:
5. Perverse Disputings of men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Minds, and destitute of the Truth,
supposing that Gain is Godliness; from
such withdraw thy self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therewith agrees what we find
also mentioned, with the Charge of
avoiding them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 23. Foolish
and <hi>unlearned Questions that gender
strifes.</hi> Some may fancy they make
themselves considerable for <hi>Learning</hi> by
such Altercations: But the Apostle slurrs
that Conceit, calling them <hi>unlearned.
So</hi> I remember<note n="*" place="margin">De Brev. Vitâ.</note> 
               <hi>Seneca</hi> says of the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> (calling it their Disease) that
they made much ado with certain idle
Questions, (as, <hi>How many Rowers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to the Vessel that carry'd</hi> Ulysses?
and such like, that he there mentions)
whereby (says he) they did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<hi>more learned,</hi> but only <hi>more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>When we consider with too little
Indulgence one anothers mistakes and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applications,
in the use even of Scripture
words,</hi> placing them as some may do,
upon things to which they do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96046:40"/>
belong, when yet they agree
about <hi>the things</hi> themselves. There
are Words in the Scripture-revelation,
that it may be the one or the other of
disagreeing Persons may apply to <hi>one
thing,</hi> when the other (perhaps truly)
thinks they belong more properly to
<hi>another.</hi> There is an Inconvenience in
this, the Case is much; as if one should
have an <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>all the Streets of</hi> London
in his Mind as they lie, but he mistakes
the Names, and transposes them: As
for Instance, calls <hi>Cheap side Cornhill,</hi> or
<hi>Cornhill Cheap-side:</hi> He does not speak
so intelligibly to another, but at the
same time may have the <hi>same Idea</hi> in his
Mind of <hi>London</hi> that another has. And
this however, when it occurs in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Disceptations, ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
(though there be an Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
in it) with Indulgence, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we are all liable to mistakes in
greater matters. And as it is possible
there may be <hi>somewhat of Carnality,</hi>
some Perverseness, some Cloud arising
from infirm Flesh that darkens the
Mind, and occasions it so to mistake;
so 'tis <hi>much greater,</hi> not to be able to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96046:41"/>
bear in another <hi>such a mistake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>When there is an agreement about
the main and principal things that the
Scripture-Revelation contains and carries
in it; but there is not that agreement about
their mutual respects and references unto
one another.</hi> This is a matter indeed
of greater Importance; there can be
no <hi>true Scheme</hi> given of <hi>Gospel-Truths</hi>
and <hi>Doctrines,</hi> if such <hi>their references</hi>
and <hi>respects</hi> to one another be not <hi>right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood:</hi> But an <hi>entire true Scheme
of Christian Doctrines</hi> will not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all minds; and for the most part
they are particular Passages, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Truths, that strike Hearts, and
that God makes use of to do Souls good
by. And if so <hi>entire a Scheme</hi> will not
enter into the minds of many, whether
through their <hi>Darkness</hi> or <hi>Ignorance,</hi>
or whether through any thing of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,</hi>
that was as it were forelaid in
their Minds; nothing remains but to
be patient of it, and to do them what
good we can, even upon their own
Terms, and in the way wherein they
are capable of it. There was such an
Obstruction in Minds among these <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:96046:41"/>
even upon this very account
<hi>of their Carnality,</hi> as we we see in that
<hi>3d.</hi> of the <hi>1st.</hi> Epistle, That <hi>the Apostle</hi>
tells them, <hi>I could not speak to you as
Spiritual,</hi> (it must be understood com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively)
<hi>but as unto Carnal;</hi> and
therefore as a <hi>wise Instructer,</hi> thought it
needful to keep back, to with-hold
some things from them that he reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
might be <hi>Meat</hi> to them, solid Meat,
<hi>strong Meat,</hi> because they had been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
<hi>unable to bear it, nor were yet able.</hi>
It is in that case needful rather some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to with-hold some
things, or suspend, than by a continued
and too urgent Inculcation to frustrate
ones own design; and while we would
have <hi>all enter</hi> into less capable Minds, to
have <hi>nothing enter.</hi> It may sometimes
be, that when too much is endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>at once</hi> to be born in upon them
against an invincible Obstruction, we
only engage them to fortifie the more
strongly, and shut out <hi>all;</hi> and so we
defeat our selves: They <hi>gain</hi> nothing,
and our whole Design is frustrated and
lost. In all our Applications to the
Souls of Men, there must be <hi>patient
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96046:42"/>
waiting,</hi> and very gradual Endeavours
used, without force and furious stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
yea, in our having to do with
such as are yet the very Vassals and
Captives of the Devil. So the Apostle
speaks, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 24. The Servant of the
Lord should not strive, but be patient
towards</hi> (even <hi>all) men, and wait</hi> (even
in reference to them that are hitherto
altogether impenitent) <hi>when God
will give them repentance, that they
may recover themselves out of the snare of
the Devil, that are led Captive by him at
his will.</hi> Much more are such Methods
to be used towards them, <hi>who call on
the Name of our Lord out of a pure Heart,</hi>
as he speaks a little above in the same
Context, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. And consider the
<hi>Extent</hi> and <hi>Endearingness</hi> of <hi>this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</hi>
'Tis to be deplor'd that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
not further: But so far as it doth
extend, God forbid it should not have
a most perswasive Efficacy and Power
upon our Spirits, to make us <hi>follow
Righteousness, Faith, Charity, Peace,</hi>
even with all them that bear that
Character, <hi>i. e. That call on the Lord
with a pure Heart. Their Lord</hi> (as 'tis
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96046:42"/>
elsewhere) <hi>as well as ours;</hi> be they of
what Party, or Denomination, soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>5. Much of <hi>this Carnality</hi> appears
<hi>about such matters,</hi> when <hi>we are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intent
to mould and square Gospel-truths
and Doctrines by humane measures and
models,</hi> and too earnestly strive to make
them correspond: That is, when we
aim, beyond what things can admit,
to stretch (or rather to shrink and
contract) God's Transactions with
Men, unto the Scheme and Model of
our own <hi>abstract Notions</hi> and Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or of meerly Humane, Civil or
Political, Occonomies, Administrations
and Transactions; <hi>such</hi> I mean as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
among Men towards <hi>one another.</hi>
And so labour to have the <hi>same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>
take place throughout in reference
to <hi>Divine things,</hi> as do in <hi>Humane.</hi>
Whereby more than is needful, useful,
(or indeed so much as possible to agree
and quadrate) of <hi>Logick, Metaphysicks;</hi>
and of <hi>Civil and other Law</hi> is introduc'd
into <hi>Theology. Illustrations</hi> indeed may
be taken thence, but not <hi>Strict Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</hi>
It is impossible sometimes they
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96046:43"/>
should be so. Divers things are taken
<hi>among Men</hi> in <hi>such Notions,</hi> as, <hi>in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the Doctrine of the Gospel</hi> cannot
have a full and adequate place: <hi>They of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
will not exactly agree or correspond.
As if in speaking of God's <hi>pardoning</hi>
and <hi>justifying</hi> a Sinner, we should take
our measures of <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
strictly from what obtains amongst
Men, we shall find a great difference
and disagreement: For plain it is,
that, according to <hi>Humane measures,</hi>
the same Person cannot be both <hi>pardoned</hi>
and <hi>justified.</hi> He that is <hi>pardoned</hi> cannot
be <hi>justified,</hi> and he that is <hi>justified</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be <hi>pardoned:</hi> But <hi>according to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Gospel-measures</hi> both are truly
said of the same Person: In the <hi>one
case</hi> there is an <hi>Inconsistency,</hi> in the <hi>other</hi>
a fair <hi>Agreement</hi> of the same things.
He that is at an <hi>Humane Barr</hi> a <hi>justified
Person,</hi> needs no <hi>Pardon,</hi> his Case ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of <hi>none:</hi> If he were <hi>justified, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
were absurdly talked of: And so
if he were <hi>pardoned,</hi> that does plainly
imply that he <hi>was not justified.</hi> It is
quite otherwise if you bring these
things to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and <hi>God's dealing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96046:43"/>
with Sinners.</hi> I cannot now spend time
in shewing you distinctly how these
things do lie, and are very capable of
being accommodated in the Sinners
case; some <hi>resemblance</hi> will appear, not
an exact or entire <hi>Correspondency.</hi> The
Instance however serves our present
purpose, to shew that <hi>God's procedure
and methods</hi> in his Dispensations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
men, will not in all things square
with <hi>Humane measures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, If we speak of the <hi>Doctrine
of God's Covenant in Jesus Christ,</hi> we
cannot take our measures from <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Covenants</hi> that pass between <hi>Man</hi>
and <hi>Man,</hi> especially one <hi>private Man</hi>
and <hi>another:</hi> For there the Persons are
under no Obligation before their <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Consent.</hi> It is not so between
<hi>God and Man, God's Covenants</hi> are <hi>Laws</hi>
as well as <hi>Covenants;</hi> and so a Man is,
before he consents, obliged to consent.
Therefore here again it appears Gospel-Doctrines
are not to be exactly mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by <hi>Humane Models.</hi> Nor should
this be too earnestly endeavoured, we
should not too much set our Minds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; 'tis to offer at a thing in it's own
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96046:44"/>
nature not practicable, and there is
too much of <hi>Man</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>When there is a discernable Prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to oppose the great things of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
to one another,</hi> and to <hi>exalt or mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
one, above or against another.</hi> It is
too plain this may more commonly
come <hi>under Observation,</hi> than it doth
<hi>under that reprehension</hi> which it deserves.
For instance, those two great things
that I mentioned at first, <hi>Justification</hi>
and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> both very great
things, of most apparent and confessed
necessity to the Salvation and Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Souls of Men: <hi>Justification,</hi>
that a man's <hi>state</hi> may be good; <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,</hi>
that the <hi>temper of his Soul</hi>
may become so. But is it not too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to magnify <hi>one</hi> of these <hi>above</hi> or
<hi>against</hi> the <hi>other?</hi> To contend and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with great Fervour concerning
the <hi>higher Value</hi> and <hi>Excellency,</hi> the <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
or <hi>Precedency</hi> of <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> and
to which the Preference belongs; to
be so much taken up about the one,
as seldom to think of the other; and
it may be not well to <hi>savour</hi> and <hi>relish</hi>
the mention of it? Some are so taken
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96046:44"/>
up about the business of <hi>Justification,</hi>
(that admirable <hi>vouchsafement of Grace
to Sinners!)</hi> that they care not to hear
of <hi>Sanctification;</hi> and so all their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is <hi>Foreign</hi> to them, or lies in
<hi>somewhat without them,</hi> or in a <hi>meer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
thing,</hi> that alters not their Spirits.
A strange Religion! that makes a man
nothing the better man. Or notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
which he is <hi>in the habitual
frame of his Soul,</hi> as bad as ever, vain,
terrene, worldly-minded, proud, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate,
wrathful, malicious, vindictive,
false, deceitful, perhaps (for that is
not worse than the rest) very impurely
sensual. But (no Man can tell why,
nor to be sure he himself) he takes
himself to <hi>be a justified person:</hi> And
perhaps his Imagination of it raises in
him a sort of rapturous, unaccountable
Joy, without ground or root, and
which will not only <hi>wither,</hi> but <hi>turn</hi>
(without a seasonable and merciful
change) <hi>into endless horror, weeping,
wailing, and gnashing of teeth!</hi> A fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and most surprizing Issue and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment
of an high and unmis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
Confidence, and expectation to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96046:45"/>
be saved! With others, whose <hi>Temper,
Circumstances</hi> or <hi>Temptations</hi> have less
inclin'd them to <hi>rejoycing,</hi> their <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is made up of tormenting Anxieties
and Fears, and consists in the daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving
of perpetual endless Doubts,
whether they are justify'd or no; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any direct, formed design of <hi>being</hi>
or <hi>doing good;</hi> by which they might
in due time, come to have more truly
comfortable apprehensions of the <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their state.</hi> They more care <hi>to
be pardon'd for being bad,</hi> than <hi>to become
good!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, on the other hand, there may
be some so wholly taken up about what
they are <hi>in themselves to be and do,</hi> and
in the earnest, but too abstract, or less
Evangelical (and therefore less fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful)
endeavour after higher pitches of
<hi>Sanctity,</hi> without due reference to the
<hi>Grace, Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of a <hi>Redeemer,</hi>
that they neglect, and look not afer
their <hi>Justification,</hi> and acceptance with
God <hi>in him;</hi> nor do relish and savour
as they ought, the <hi>Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi>
herein. Do more incline to a
<hi>Philosophical</hi> (and <hi>scarcely Christian)
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96046:45"/>
Christianity;</hi> forgetting <hi>Christ</hi> to be
their <hi>Redeemer,</hi> their <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Vital
Head,</hi> and that they are (or ought to
be) under his Conduct, and through
his Mediation, daily tending to God
and Blessedness.</p>
            <p>But now upon the whole, when there
appears an aptness or disposition to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
these two, <hi>Justification</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi>
from one another, or either
of them from <hi>abiding in Christ,</hi> or to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them to one another, or contend
about the Priority of the one or the
other (when no doubt they go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
and about the Preference or
Excellency of the one above the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which is the more conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
thing: Herein appears much
Carnality of Mind, an unsound, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
distempered Spirit. And 'tis
a like case, as if a <hi>Malefactor</hi> at the
same time is <hi>under Sentence,</hi> by which
he is condemned <hi>to die,</hi> and under a
most <hi>dangerous Disease,</hi> that appears
very probably <hi>mortal</hi> to him: He has a
<hi>compassionate Prince,</hi> willing to save his
Life, and he at once <hi>vouchsafes him his
Pardon,</hi> and provides a very skilful and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96046:46"/>
able Physician <hi>for the curing of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease:</hi>
The wretched Creature hearing
of this, falls a disputing which of
these is the greater Favour, to <hi>have my
Disease cured,</hi> or, <hi>to have my Crime par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned;</hi>
and in the heat of the Dispute
he neglects both, looks after neither.
This is indeed less supposeable, <hi>in the
instanced case;</hi> but how great a <hi>Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
doth it shew, that it should be so,
<hi>in this,</hi> which is of so unexpressibly
greater importance!</p>
            <p>And now further it is agreed on all
hands, that <hi>Faith in a Redeemer</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation, with those that
<hi>are Adult,</hi> and capable of attending to
the Gospel Revelation: But here, what
Disputes are there raised? With what
Fervor are they managed, concerning
the <hi>place</hi> of <hi>it,</hi> or the <hi>kind</hi> of that <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi>
which <hi>this Faith</hi> is of, in order to
the safe state of a Sinner? A like
Case again, as if such a <hi>Condemned
Malefactor</hi> is told of his <hi>Princes</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
gracious Intendments towards
him, but he doubts the Sincerity of
his Professions. He gives him all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable
Assurances, and tells him, Do
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96046:46"/>
but trust me, and all shall be well.
But he presently falls a disputing, Yea,
but how am I to consider <hi>this trust?</hi>
(We suppose it only such a Trust as may
be fitly enough placed upon a Man)
Which way is it to contribute towards
my Safety or Welfare? Is it to be an
<hi>Instrument</hi> or a <hi>Condition?</hi> How absurd
an Abuse were this of the Clemency
of a Propitious Prince? If there were
a publick Proclamation of Pardon to
many Offenders at once concerned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and they all agree only to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree,
to vie with one another their
skill in criticizing upon the Words, or
in disputing the Method, contending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Order and Coherence of Parts,
and make it their business not thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to accept, but cavil at, to tear and
mangle and pluck in pieces the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and defeat the kind Design and
gracious Tender of their Prince?
What Clemency would not this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
to the highest Resentment and
Indignation? And what now can be
stranger, or more perverse, than that
a Revelation from Heaven <hi>of so much
good will to men,</hi> in the substance so
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96046:47"/>
plain, and that so directly concerns the
Salvation of Souls, should be so torn
and mangled? Consider'd for no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
less than that for which it was
vouchsafed, and that the very end it
self should be in so great part eluded,
that was so kindly designed in it?
Tho' yet the Endeavour of salving
Difficulties that occur, by <hi>earnest
Prayer, diligent Study,</hi> and by <hi>amicable
and placid Collation,</hi> among Brethren,
or comparing of Sentiments, sincerely
designed for a clearer understanding
the <hi>Frame of the Gospel-truth,</hi> or how
it may be with most advantage repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to Men for the promoting of the
<hi>Common Salvation,</hi> can be liable to no
just Reprehension, being managed
with <hi>that Reverence</hi> that so Sacred
things challenge, and with a due sense
of our own Ignorance and Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
That only which is blamable in
this case, and whereof I reckon no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
can be given, or Defence made,
is that when, for the substance, the
Gospel propounds and lays before us
so plain a way wherein men are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the saving of their Souls, as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96046:47"/>
wherein <hi>the wayfaring man, tho' a Fool,
needs not err,</hi> i. e. That there must be
<hi>Repentance towards God, Faith in our
Lord Jesus Christ, a renewed Heart, an
Holy Life.</hi> One comes and pretends to
shew that Order of these things <hi>one
way,</hi> so as to compose a <hi>Scheme</hi> of them
that is represented as most necessary
to be observed and held to. No, saith
another, I'll give you a righter Scheme
of Salvation, <hi>another way,</hi> and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
presses the Necessity of <hi>that,</hi> and
the dangerous mistakes of the other:
And thus they cover a <hi>plain way</hi> with
<hi>Thorns and Briars,</hi> do not instruct, but
perplex and distract whom they should
direct, create <hi>Distinctions</hi> and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of <hi>Scheme</hi> to <hi>Scheme,</hi> not only
<hi>without necessity,</hi> but almost <hi>without a
difference,</hi> and yet insist with Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
and lay Men's Salvation upon
their understanding the matter so or so,
when it is hoped thousands have been
saved, that never heard of the <hi>one
Scheme</hi> or the <hi>other,</hi> as they are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
and opposed to each other.
Who can justify this? Again in the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96046:48"/>
7. Place: When any do <hi>with great
Zeal contend for this or that Opinion or
Notion, as very Sacred and highly Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi>
(as they account) <hi>with no other
Design, than that under that pretence they
may indulge their own carnal Inclination
with the greater liberty.</hi> It was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>this sort of men</hi> against
whom this Epistle was meant, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were then called <hi>Gnosticks</hi> it
matters not. The Name well agreed
to them, and they were known by it
afterwards. They were Men of much
preten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to Knowledge and <hi>sublime No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
(as they counted them.) And
<hi>herein lay their Religion;</hi> and under this
pretence, they indulged themselves in
all manner of Licentiousness. When
any do take up with <hi>meer Notions,</hi>
which they are zealous for, accounting
them very highly Spiritual; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretext of these, they indulge the
Carnality of their Hearts, if not of
their Lives and Practices too: And
their <hi>sine Notion,</hi> (as they account
it) which they <hi>(more uncertainly)</hi> father
upon the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> must be <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted</hi>
in the room of all that <hi>Love,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96046:48"/>
Meekness, Humility, Heavenliness, Self-denial,</hi>
which are the most certain and
undoubted Fruits of <hi>this blessed Spirit:</hi>
When under the Pretence of <hi>being No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Men,</hi> and of knowing a great
deal more than most others do, any
neglect their own Spirits, and suffer
<hi>Pride, Avarice, Ambition, Vindictive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Falsehood,</hi> to shelter themselves
under the thin Cobweb of a few sine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spun
Notions; and they can now
hereupon live at random, with more
case to their own Minds, and they think,
with better Reputation as to other
Men.</p>
            <p>Here is a <hi>glittering shew</hi> only of an
aiery, imagin'd, pretended <hi>Spirituality,</hi>
drawn over (but which doth not hide)
corrupt, rotten, putrid <hi>Flesh.</hi> Have you
never known such a case, when it might
be said there goes a <hi>proud, ambitious M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n,</hi>
a <hi>covetous</hi> Man, a <hi>false</hi> Man, a <hi>malicious</hi>
Man; but he is a Man of <hi>rare and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Notions,</hi> knows a great deal more
than most others do; and this must
atone for all his Crimes with God and
Man, and both <hi>quiet his Conscience,</hi> and
<hi>salve his Credit</hi> together! And who can
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96046:49"/>
doubt but this man must be very fond
of his <hi>own Opinions,</hi> and zealously <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
and dispute</hi> for them upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
(tho' he never so ineptly make
it) when they are to do him <hi>so great
Service,</hi> and to stand him in so much
stead, <hi>i. e.</hi> to supply the room for
him of all real <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Morality.</hi>
And if he have happened upon <hi>such
Notions</hi> as are really <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>revealed
by God himself,</hi> by how much the <hi>more
certainly Divine</hi> they be, so much the
greater is the Wickedness, so basely
to prostitute <hi>Sacred things,</hi> Truths that
are the very Off-spring of Heaven, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
so vile purposes. It were Fault
enough to make them serve different or
other purposes than they are capable
of, <hi>i. e.</hi> to supply the room of <hi>Religion
and real goodness.</hi> What an Indignity
is that to <hi>Religion,</hi> to suppose an <hi>empty,
spiritless Opinion</hi> can fill up it's place!
A thing that does a man no good, for
which his Mind and Spirit is nothing
the better! Much more, that shelters
what is so very bad? Can this serve for
Religion? That Religion that consists
with being <hi>proud,</hi> with being <hi>deceitful,</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:96046:49"/>
with being <hi>malicious,</hi> with being <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful,</hi>
learn, learn, to despise <hi>such
a Religion!</hi> Much more that is taken
up to vail over these, and exclude all
real goodness! Again,</p>
            <p>8. When, <hi>in the maintaining any
Doctrine of the Gospel in opposition to
others, we industriously set our selves to
pervert their meaning, and impute things
to them that they never say.</hi> Or again,
<hi>If we charge their Opinions whom we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
with Consequences which they disclaim,</hi>
professing, it may be, rather to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
their <hi>former Opinion,</hi> and change
their Judgment, than admit <hi>such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,</hi>
if they could discern <hi>any
Connexion</hi> between <hi>the one</hi> and <hi>the other.</hi>
This surely argues a mighty Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to contend, when we will quarrel
with one that is really of our own
Mind; for herein he appears to be
<hi>virtually</hi> already of the same mind in
a greater matter, at least, than he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
with us about; because no man
charges another's Opinion with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
designing thereby to oblige
him to change his Opinion; but as
supposing it to be an agreed thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96046:50"/>
them both, that the <hi>Consequence</hi>
is worse than the Opinion. When
therefore the Consequence I charge is
disclaimed by him whom I oppose, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it is <hi>justly</hi> charged, or it <hi>is not.</hi>
If it be not, his Opinion <hi>may be true,</hi>
notwithstanding what I herein say to
the contrary, and I am certainly so far
in an <hi>Error.</hi> But if it be justly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
being yet disclaimed, we are <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi>
agreed concerning the <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi>
and are <hi>vertually</hi> agreed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the disputed Point too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he professedly disavows it upon
supposition such a Consequence would
follow, which yet perhaps he sees
not; and so the Agreement must
be much greater than the Difference.
And yet commonly this signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in order to Peace: That is, it is
not enough, that I see the same things
that you do, unless I also see it too
with your Eyes.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>When sucb Disputes do arise</hi> at
length <hi>to Wrath, to angry Strife, yea,
and even to fixed Enmity.</hi> What dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Carnality</hi> is here! Most deservedly
so called, if you only consider <hi>Flesh</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:96046:50"/>
or <hi>Carnality</hi> as an <hi>unreasonable,</hi> a <hi>brutal</hi>
thing. For what can be more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
or unaccountable than to fall
out with another man, because he
thinks not as I do, or receives not my
Sentiments, as I also do not receive his.
Is it not to be considered, that he <hi>no
further differs from me than I do from
him?</hi> If there be cause of Anger, upon
this account, <hi>on one side,</hi> there is the
<hi>same cause</hi> on the <hi>other</hi> too; and then
whether shall this grow? And how
little can this avail upon a rational
Estimate? Can any good come of it?
Doth it tend to the clearning of Truth?
Shall we see the better thorough the
Clouds and Dust we raised? Is a good
Cause served by it? Or do we think
it possible <hi>the Wrath of Man should
ever-work the Righteousness of God?</hi>
And when <hi>such Carnalities</hi> as these do
exert themselves, and the <hi>hot Steams</hi>
and <hi>Fumes</hi> arise, which the Apostle
here calls the <hi>Lusts of the Flesh,</hi> the
Flesh <hi>lusting to Envy, lusting to Wrath:</hi>
What is the Product, (or even the
productive Cause) but <hi>that sort of
Fire</hi> which is without Light? And
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96046:51"/>
you know <hi>what Fire that resembles!</hi> And
if a Man once find any Fervour of this
kind stir, or kindle in his Breast, if he
aright consider, he would no more
cherish it, than one would do a <hi>Brand</hi>
thrown into his Bosom from the Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Fire. One would think in this
case, <hi>What have I stirring within me?
Something a kin to Hell!</hi> Can this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the Service of <hi>Divine and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Truth?</hi> And let it be sadly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered;
our being, upon such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
<hi>angry with one another,</hi> is a <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
token</hi> of God's being angry with
us all, and a <hi>provoking Cause</hi> of it too.
Methinks that should be a <hi>qualmy
Thought!</hi> and strike our Souls with a
strange Damp! Shall I indulge that in
my self, that is a mark upon me of
Divine Displeasure; and upon all in
whom it is found? To have his Holy
Spirit retire, that blessed <hi>Spirit of
Love, and of a sound mind,</hi> and to leave
us under the Power of rebellious lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Flesh! Can this be grateful, or not
be a dismaying, frightful thing? And
whereas a <hi>right Scheme</hi> of <hi>Gospel-Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
is the thing pretended to be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96046:51"/>
striven for, I beseech you consider:
The more entirely, and the more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>the true Scheme</hi> of <hi>Gospel-Doctrine</hi>
is inlaid in a man's Soul, the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it must form it into <hi>all Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Humility, Gentleness, Love, Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Benignity</hi> towards <hi>Fellow-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
of whatsoever Denomination;</hi> not
confined, not limited, (as that of the
<hi>Pharisees)</hi> unto <hi>their own Party;</hi> but
diffusing and spreading it self to all that
<hi>bear the Charaster and Cognisance of
Christ. The Spirit of our Lord Jesus
Christ</hi> is a Spirit of <hi>greater amplitude;</hi>
extends and diffuses it self through the
whole Body of Christ.</p>
            <p>Nor can any Man more effectually
disgrace his own Cause, or make
sure to worst himself in it, than
by defending it wrathfully. For ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that he erre whom I oppose, a
thousand to one but that <hi>my Wrath</hi> is
worse than <hi>his Error,</hi> probably thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times worse. I go about there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to take away a <hi>Moat from his Eye,</hi>
having a <hi>Beam in my own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or am more
concerned for a <hi>misplaced Hair upon his
Head,</hi> than I am for a <hi>Fiery Vlcer in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96046:52"/>
my own Breast.</hi> We are not, 'tis true, to
be so <hi>Stoical</hi> to condemn the <hi>Natural
Passion</hi> of <hi>Anger, as such</hi> for sinful. But if
it exceeds it's Cause, and <hi>sets not with the
Sun,</hi> it becomes <hi>strange, unhallowed, Fire.</hi>
But again in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>10th</hi> place, There is still a further
appearance of great Carnality in such
cases, <hi>when any do adventure to judge of
the Consciences and States of them whom
they oppose, or from whom they differ.</hi>
When they <hi>ascend the Tribunal, usurp
the Throne,</hi> pass Sentence upon them,
as Men of no <hi>Conscience,</hi> or of no <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,</hi>
or <hi>Vprightness of Heart with God.</hi>
As if <hi>theirs</hi> were to be the <hi>Vniversal
Conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the measure of all Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
and he that cannot be govern'd
by their Conscience must have none at
all: Or he be stark blind towards
Truth, towards God, and towards
himself, that sees not every thing they
see, or fancy themselves to see.</p>

With what Reverence and Dread
should it strike a Man's Soul in such
a case! When we have the <hi>Rights</hi> of
the <hi>Redeemer</hi> asserted in those whom
he hath bought with his Blood? And
are told that <hi>for this end Christ both
died and rose, and revived, that he might
be Lord both of the Dead and Living,</hi>
ver. 9. And it's thereupon further
said to us, <hi>Who art thou that judgest
anothers Servant,</hi> as <hi>ver. 10. Why dost
thou judge thy Brother, or set at nought
thy Brother? We must all stand before
the Judgment-seat of Christ.</hi> We are
all of us <hi>his,</hi> he both <hi>died, and revived,
and rose again,</hi> that he might be <hi>Lord
of all,</hi> as Acts 10. 36. And here of

be <hi>Owner of all,</hi> which is the first No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

he is to finish all things <hi>by the last Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>

is the ground of the Expostulation
laid. Who art thou who presumest
to justle him out of <hi>this his Supream and

disputed about may be <hi>doubtful,</hi> but
there is <hi>no doubt</hi> concerning this <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
Authority</hi> of our Lord Christ,
or concerning his Law against such

What Tenderness of offending, of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting

            <p>To <hi>judge other Men's Consciences,</hi> is of
so near affinity with <hi>governing them,</hi>
that they that can allow themselves to
do the former, want <hi>only Power,</hi> not
<hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Inclination,</hi> to offer at the other
too. Which puts the matter out of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96046:53"/>
doubt, that when Men of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
complain of such Usurpation, 'tis
not that they think it an Offence <hi>in it's
self,</hi> but <hi>against them</hi> only; and that
no Consciences ought to be free, but
<hi>their own.</hi> The Proof of an honest and
equal Mind herein is, when we judge
this to be <hi>Evil,</hi> not being <hi>hurt by it;</hi>
or abhor to hurt others in this kind,
when we have Power to do it. Upon
which account that <hi>Passage</hi> is memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

<hi>compare our selves with our selves,</hi> never
letting it enter into our Minds, that
others have their Sentiments too, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
wiser than ours; but abound in
our own sense; and while (as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi>

and perhaps are the only Persons that
think our selves so, we yet take upon
us, as if we were fit to dictate to the

Men, and Wisdom must die with us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a sort of Evil, than which
there is none more common, and none
less observed; none wherewith <hi>the
guilty</hi> are so little apt to charge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or admit Conviction of it. For,
I pray, do but consider; All the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
differing Parties amongst us do
with one voice pretend to be for
Peace; but <hi>how,</hi> and upon <hi>what Terms?</hi>
Why, that all the rest are presently to
be of their Mind; and that is all the
Peace that most are for. For where
(scarce any where) is the Man to be
found? Or how great a Rarity is he!
that entertains the Thought <hi>that there
may, for ought I know, be much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
and corrected in my Apprehensions
of things,</hi> to make me capable of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in with that Truth which ought
to be common to all. There is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
with many, <hi>of a good time,
and state of things, before this world end,
when all shall be of one mind and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
But the most think it must be
<hi>by all men's becoming of their mind and
Judgment.</hi> And of <hi>this Self-conceit</hi> it
is usually a harder thing to fasten Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96046:55"/>
upon Men, than of most other
Evils. We have more hope in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against Drunkenness, Murder, or
any the grossest kind of Wickedness:
For there the Conscience of the guilty
falls in, and takes part with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover.
But we can more easily and
more frequently do (tho' not frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough) observe the Faults of the
<hi>Inferiour Faculties,</hi> or of our <hi>External
Actions,</hi> than of the <hi>Faculty it self which
should observe.</hi> Our <hi>Mind,</hi> which is
naturally <hi>like</hi> our <hi>Eye,</hi> is, in this, <hi>too
like, i. e.</hi> That it can see every thing
but <hi>it self.</hi> It doth not, by using it,
preserve it's <hi>peculiar, self-reflecting Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
Is blind towards it's self, beyond
what naturally belongs to it. An Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
may be too near our Bodily Eye
to be seen. Our <hi>Mind</hi> is herein <hi>too
bodily,</hi> too much carnaliz'd, sunk too
deep into <hi>Flesh.</hi> It is the next thing
to it self; and <hi>here,</hi> not by it's <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Nature,</hi> (by which as an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Sun it could revert it's Beams,
and turn them inward upon it self)
but <hi>by Depravation, it</hi> for the most part
<hi>sees nothing;</hi> or <hi>doth worse,</hi> thinks it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:96046:55"/>
self to see what is not to be seen, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>imaginary</hi> Excellencies, which
make the Man his <hi>own Idol;</hi> an Object
of <hi>a sort of Adoration to himself;</hi> and
of <hi>Scorn and Derision</hi> (most probably)
to every one else. In this case every
Man is, however, most commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
in his own Eyes, or still thinks
he is in the right, amidst the so vast a
variety of Apprehensions and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
no one suspects himself to be in
the wrong. All are <hi>for the Truth,</hi> and
they are all for <hi>Peace and Vnion.</hi> By
which some indeed, more gently, mean,
they hope all will quit their former
<hi>mistaken Opinions and ways</hi> (as in great
kindness to themselves they take for
granted all Men's are but their own)
and come wholly over to them. Others
that have not Breasts capable of even so
much <hi>Charity</hi> as this, not only are as
much <hi>Lovers and Admirers of themselves,</hi>
but so <hi>vehement Haters</hi> of all that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to differ from them, that they
think them not fit to live in the World
that durst adventure to do so. The
meaning therefore of their being <hi>for
Peace,</hi> is, that they would have all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96046:56"/>
that are not of their minds: And
then (as the <hi>Roman Historian</hi> speaks)
<hi>Quando solitudinem fecere appellant pacem.</hi>
When they have made a <hi>Desolation,</hi> so
that they themselves are left alone in
the World, <hi>that</hi> they will call <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will say, What is to be
done? Or what would I persw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de in
this case of <hi>differing Apprehensions and
ways</hi> still remaining among Christians?
I answer, Not presently to <hi>unbelieve</hi> all
that ever a man hath believed before;
or to abandon on the suddain his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Sentiments, or to find fault with
himself for having thought them right.
For 'tis a Contradiction to be of any
Opinion, and not then to think it
right. Nor (therefore) is it <hi>Scepticism,</hi>
by any means, that I would advise to;
as if there were nothing to be thought
certain. <hi>But this:</hi> That whereas the
greatest and most necessary things in
<hi>Religion</hi> are most plain, that is, either
<hi>most plain in themselves,</hi> or most expresly
revealed in the Word of God. Here
let us be stedfast <hi>our</hi> selves, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>severe</hi> towards <hi>other men. Other
things,</hi> that are more <hi>matter of doubt</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:96046:56"/>
and <hi>dispute,</hi> by how much the less
plain they are, we should count so much
the less necessary. In reference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to these loss momentous things,
about which there is with us most of
Jangling, there ought always to be
<hi>great modesty,</hi> and <hi>distrust</hi> of our own
Understandings, and a continued readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to receive Information, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
looking up to the <hi>Father of Lights</hi>
for further <hi>Illumination,</hi> and a Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherein we, with others, have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<hi>to walk by the same Rule, minding
the same</hi> (agreed) <hi>things,</hi> hoping God
will reveal his Mind to the otherwise
minded in his own time, as the <hi>Apostle,</hi>
in 3 <hi>Phil.</hi> 16, 17, But to hasten to a
Close, I further add in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Last place, Such Carnality</hi> greatly
shews it's self in an <hi>Affectation and Desire
of having such Disputes still kept a-foot,
and the Contests continued without</hi> either
<hi>Limit,</hi> or rational <hi>Design.</hi> This shews a
<hi>deep Tincture;</hi> and is a plain Indication of
a Mind to a very great degree <hi>carnaliz'd,</hi>
when a mighty pleasure is taken to see
the <hi>Saw drawn,</hi> and the <hi>Ball kept up.</hi>
And if the Question be ask'd, <hi>Pray
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96046:57"/>
how long?</hi> So little of reasonable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
can be given, that it might as
well be said in plain terms, <hi>Till all
Words be spent,</hi> till <hi>Speech or Language
fail,</hi> till <hi>Elias come,</hi> or <hi>Dooms-day come.</hi>
So that if there were never so much
reason to commend the having said
somewhat in defence of this or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
disputed Point, we might yet say as
<hi>Seneca</hi> did of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s so much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praising
his own <hi>Consulship, I blame him
not for praising it</hi> without <hi>Cause, but for
doing it without End;</hi> or that he could
never give over, or tell when he had
said enough. Upon the same Terms
upon which it is <hi>now</hi> so much desired
such Disputes should be continued,
when what is truly enough is already
said, they might as well <hi>wish they always
should.</hi> Which signifies that when we
say, we would have Men contend for
Truth, we wish it not so much for
<hi>Truth's sake,</hi> as for the <hi>Contention's sake.</hi>
By all means, say they, strive for the
Truth: Not that they care so much
for <hi>Truth,</hi> as for the <hi>Strife.</hi> For in
some Circumstances there is not an
End in view, that is rationally to be
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96046:57"/>
designed or served by it on this side
the <hi>End of all things.</hi> Nor consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
any <hi>good Principle</hi> that is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd
or gratify'd thereby. What is
needful to be said in the matters alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
referr'd to, for the informing and
satisfying of tractable Minds, sincerely
willing to understand the Truth, lies
within a little Compass. And when,
in Controversie, that is once said which
truly belongs to the very Point in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
the rest is commonly <hi>trifling</hi> and
<hi>reflexion,</hi> or the <hi>perplexing</hi> of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
more, and <hi>darkning Counsel by words
without knowledge.</hi> If <hi>Love to Truth</hi> be
alledged for the Principle that prompts
Men to covet so continual Altercations
about it, I would say this shews <hi>more
want of love to it.</hi> For hereby they
are diverted from that which renders
it most of all amiable, and for which
it ought chiefly to be loved. As it is the
<hi>Truth according to Godliness, and by which
we are to be sanctify'd,</hi> and <hi>begotten</hi> more
and more (as of an <hi>Immortal Seed)</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Divine Likeness.</hi> Experience
shews how little Disputes better Men's
Spirits. If we love <hi>Divine Truth,</hi> why
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96046:58"/>
do we not feed and <hi>live</hi> upon it, and
<hi>enjoy</hi> it's pleasant Relishes? But <hi>relish
Gravel</hi> more, or <hi>Chaff</hi> and <hi>Bran.</hi> For
<hi>thither</hi> the Agitation of continued Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
about it doth <hi>soon sift it,</hi> the
Grain or Floure (the <hi>Kidney of the
wheat)</hi> being pass'd away, and gone
from us. Can none remember when
the <hi>Disputative Humour</hi> had even eaten
out the Power and Spirit of <hi>Practical
Religion and Godliness?</hi> Thither things
are again tending, if either by Severity
or Mercy, (one may say rather than
not otherwise, <hi>by merciful Severity)</hi> God
do not prevent and repress that Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.
As yet I fear the Humour is
violent, when the Fervour of Men's
Spirits is such, as to carry them over
all Scripture directions, and Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,
that they signifie nothing with
them: Only make it their business each
one to animate the more vogued Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
of their own Party into the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Ferments, and cry, Dispute, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute,
Write, Write; Preach, Preach
one against another; let not the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
go over so, do not keep silence.
Thus are many, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96046:58"/>
puft <hi>up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for one against another,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.
6. And what, has such a <hi>Text of
Scripture</hi> as that no <hi>Edge?</hi> no <hi>Point?</hi>
by which to <hi>lance,</hi> to <hi>pierce</hi> such a <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour?</hi>
No, when the Humour is once
up, and has inwrapt Men's Hearts, is
settled there, and hath obdur'd them
to a brawny hardness: Such Texts of
Scripture, though so mighty <hi>pat</hi> and
<hi>apposite,</hi> are esteemed by them but as
<hi>Leviathan</hi> esteems <hi>Spears</hi> and <hi>Swords,
like Straw and rotten wood,</hi> they do not
enter into Men's Heares. A strange
kind of Obduration!</p>
            <p>And how supposeable is it, that they
who are so <hi>puft up for others,</hi> may also,
through the known Corruption of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
even in the best, do herein not a
little to the <hi>puffing up of them too.</hi> The
Apostle's concluding of <hi>this Chapter</hi>
with those <hi>Cautions, Let us not be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of Vain glory, provoking one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
envying one another,</hi> immediately
upon his renewing of the Precept,
<hi>ver. 25. Of walking in the Spirit:</hi> And
immediately before those Words, <hi>Chap.

ye which are Spiritual, restore such a one
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96046:59"/>
in the Spirit of meekness,</hi> shews how he
understood the Case to be with these
<hi>Galatian Christians,</hi> that as to <hi>Doctrinals</hi>
were yet <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>unfall'n.</hi> That there
was yet such Carnality working in
their <hi>continued Contests, (tho' for the
Truth)</hi> such <hi>Pride,</hi> such affectation of
<hi>Vain-glory,</hi> such <hi>wrathfulness,</hi> as shew'd
it was not <hi>meer love to Truth</hi> that kept
up the Contest, but <hi>some such worse
Principles.</hi> Nothing is plainer than
that <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> measure one
another. And when that <hi>is done,</hi> or
<hi>coveted to be done,</hi> that serves no <hi>good
End;</hi> or is <hi>so done,</hi> as not to <hi>serve</hi> but
<hi>destroy,</hi> or hinder any <hi>end that is truly
good;</hi> the <hi>Principle</hi> must be <hi>very bad,</hi>
that moves the Wheel. <hi>Disorderly Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrick
Motions</hi> bewray their <hi>Principle</hi>
and <hi>End</hi> together. When the Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
and Conduct of an Affair that
carries with it the appearance of <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Truth,</hi> is <hi>impetuous, eager, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitant;</hi>
when there is no good End
in view of the present <hi>so modify'd En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour;</hi>
when enough is <hi>agreed alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
to serve the most important Ends,
<hi>Vnity among Brethren,</hi> the <hi>Salvation of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96046:59"/>
Souls,</hi> and yet things are further insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on, <hi>unnecessary</hi> to either, yea, <hi>preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dscial</hi>
to both, and upon which the
weight and stress of either of these
cannot be laid <hi>without sin;</hi> it too plainly
appears <hi>Vain-glory</hi> to <hi>ones self,</hi> or the
<hi>slurring</hi> of a <hi>(designed) Adversary</hi> is the
<hi>End;</hi> and then the <hi>Principle</hi> is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.
Yet even <hi>in the Light,</hi> and
<hi>when matters are thus open and in view,</hi>
Oppositions are push'd on, and Men's
Spirits rise to that pitch, as to bear
down what-ever is proposed, only with
design to make their Career a little
slower: Yea, and they are apt, rather
than hearken, to put opprobious <hi>Names</hi>
and <hi>Characters</hi> upon them that are not
altogether so furious as themselves.</p>
            <p>Nor have they themselves the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to consider Consequences, and
whether these things tend; that is,
that God is provoked, that the Souls of
Men are endanger'd, greatly endan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger'd.
I have found in my own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
that some even in Distress,
in Agonies, have said, <q>Lord, be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to us, I know not which way
to go; one preaches one thing, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96046:60"/>
reaches the quite contrary.</q> I
know they mistake; we do generally
in substance preach the <hi>same Gospel.</hi>
Thanks be to God his Gospel is not
confin'd to a few Men, or to this or
that Party of Men. But in the mean
time, it is a thing of very ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to lay <hi>Stumbling-blocks before the
blind,</hi> Barrs and Obstructions in the
way of the <hi>weak and the lame,</hi> whereby
they may <hi>be turned out of the way, who
should rather be strengthened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not considered, that where the
danger is less of an <hi>utter Ruine</hi> to the
Souls of Men, there is however occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd
a great <hi>Languor</hi> and <hi>Enfeeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
They should be considered, and
treated, not only <hi>as being weak,</hi> but lest
<hi>they should be made so.</hi> When they are
diverted from the <hi>proper means</hi> of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
and Growth, and their
Minds are <hi>alienated from those means</hi>
being otherwise engaged, an <hi>ill Habit</hi>
is contracted; and when the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
hath <hi>seized some,</hi> it spreads, and
soon <hi>infects more.</hi> Nutriment is dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<hi>from the Head through the Body,</hi> by
the Co-operation of the several parts,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96046:60"/>
as those <hi>Texts, Eph. 4. 16. Col.</hi> 2. 19.
do with great <hi>Emphasis</hi> and <hi>Elegancy</hi>
speak. Understand it so, that how far
soever <hi>there is,</hi> or <hi>ought to be actual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>
every <hi>Limb</hi> and <hi>Joynt</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
something to the strength and
vigour of the rest. So is Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ministred, and spreads it's self in
the Body <hi>to it's edifying it's self in love:</hi>
Which <hi>Love</hi> if it fail, an universal Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor
cannot but ensue, the free Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Vital Spirits being obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and stopt. And those that are most
sensible, if they be not so much <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi>
damnified, cannot, when they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it, but be grieved, and take it
bitterly to Heart; when the Tokens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to their View of a general Decay.
The living Members of any Body are
pained, when the Body is wasted and
rent; dead or stupify'd and benummed
Members feel it not, are unapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive.
But above all, it ought to be
considered, (and how little is it?) that
the Holy Spirit is grieved, and doth (as
we may fear it will more) sensibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.
The Gospel in which it is wont
to breathe is trifled with: <hi>The glorious
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96046:61"/>
Gospel! The Gospel of the Grace of God!</hi>
(Can Men find nothing else to play
with?) by which that blessed Spirit
hath begotten many a Soul to God, and
nourish'd them unto Life Eternal. <hi>That
precious thing</hi> designed for so great, and
sacred purposes, (as pampered, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
Children do with their Food) they
dally with, or quarrel about it, or
squander and throw it away. How can
this but offend? The self-procur'd Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
which did precede, and those
that ensue, encrease the Offence. When
'tis said, <hi>Eph. 4. 30. Grieve not the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit of God</hi>—and presently sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
<hi>ver. 31. Let all bitterness, and
wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking
be put away.</hi> Is it not less to us
to collect, that <hi>these things do more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
grieve the Spirit? That Spirit of
Grace,</hi> of all Love, Goodness, Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Benignity. There is but <hi>one
Body, and one Spirit,</hi> a Spirit that spreads
vital Influence in the Body. What
can you think of that Spirit that feels
every where? <hi>That is in the Body an
universal Sentient?</hi> How can that Spirit
but be grieved! <hi>Passion</hi> it is not capable
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96046:61"/>
of, hut <hi>just and sedate Displicency,</hi> that
matters should be so. How should any
of us like it, to have our living Body
torn Limb from Limb, and part from
part! Though with him <hi>real Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and <hi>Disturbance</hi> can have no place.
<hi>Intellectual Resentment</hi> is infinitely
greater and deeper than we can either
<hi>feel</hi> or <hi>conceive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But where this angry, tumify'd
<hi>Proud Flesh</hi> is the governing thing, none
of these tremendous Consequences or
Considerations, <hi>while it is so,</hi> take any
place. The litigious quarrelsom <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>

               <hi>How little</hi> any of us <hi>know,</hi> or are

their <hi>want of Love,</hi> or their <hi>Hellish Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity</hi>
makes them <hi>Devils.</hi> That as by

would contribute more to <hi>Peace,</hi> (and
to the discerning of <hi>Truth</hi> too) than
the most <hi>fervent Disceptation.</hi> That
there is no hope of proselyting the
