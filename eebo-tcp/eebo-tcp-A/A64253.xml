            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE AVTHORS PREFACE:</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter we have shewed the <hi>gaine</hi> of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (out of <hi>1 Tim. 6. 6.)</hi> now we come to speake of the <hi>priviledge</hi> of it, that it brings Contentment with it, whereby the heart of a godly man is stayed, and resteth in God, well apaid with that estate and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of goods which the Lord hath made his portion, be it more or lesse. A most rare vertue, and full of sweetnesse: when as the minde, grounded upon Gods providence and promises, reposeth
<pb facs="tcp:43759:8"/>
it selfe in GOD, and hath learned with <hi>Paul</hi> in every estate to be Content, to want and abound, to be full and hungry, &amp;c. <hi>Phil. 4. 11, 12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctr.</hi> True Contentation is the daughter of Godlinesse. One ly <hi>delight in the Lord</hi> can give us our <hi>hearts desire, Psal. 37. 4.</hi> He that drinks of this water, shall thirst againe: but he that drinks of the water that I shall give him, <hi>shall never thirst, Iohn 4. 14.</hi> And <hi>blessed</hi> is he whom thou choosest, and makest come unto thee: he shall dwell and <hi>be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> with the pleasures of thy house, <hi>Psal. 65. 4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason 1.</hi> Because true Con tentment is a fruit of Faith, ari sing through perswasion of there mission of sinne, and reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God; together with as surance of our Adoption, whereby
<pb facs="tcp:43759:8"/>
wee become sons, and are interes sed in the fatherly providence of God, which will watch over our good, and reserve for us such an estate as his wisedome and love shall see meet for us.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is the disease of corrupt hearts (which all of us carry) that they cannot but insatiably long and covet after worse things if they be not filled with the best: even as a bad stomacke not filled with wholesome food, will sucke in w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd to torment it. But if once God and his grace take up our hearts, that by Faith and Hope we can sat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3 No earthly thing can bring Content; and therefore it must be the daughter of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

               </gap>e and drossie; whereas the minde is of a divine and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall nature. Can earthly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures fill the soule, as they doe a Chest? or can you fill a Chest with graces and vertues? Can you fill the stomack with wisdome, as with meat? These be not capable one of another: there is no proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene them. These earthly things are unnaturall nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the soule of man, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not satisfie the hunger of the minde. So saith <hi>Solomon, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles 5. 10. Hee that loveth money shall not be satisfied with it.</hi> It is onely the bread of Life, and Christs righteousnesse, a spirituall nourishment, that can replenish emptiesoules. Nothing lesse then God can fill the heart, being of a spirituall substance, created to his Image, and to
<pb facs="tcp:43759:9"/>
be a Temple for his Spirit.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It is proper to godlinesse, if the estate be not fitted to the minde, to fit the mind to his estate. And this is partly by the <hi>Rules</hi> it affordeth for every afflicted condition, partly by the <hi>power</hi> it hath to give the soule Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though other comforts faile: those in the generall body of this Treatise, this in the last Chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse I.</hi> It followes hence, that an ungodly man can have no content, but is as the raging Sea, casting out myre and dirt. He may have riches; but no rest. He may fill his Chest, but not his minde. For it is not in those things, to give peace; nay, as the curse attends him in other things, so, in this spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, He eates, but is not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as the seven leane Kine ate the seven fatones, but were never the fatter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43759:10"/>
               <hi>Vse 2.</hi> This teacheth us, how a man may be rich without riches (which is a riddle in Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) namely, when godlinesse and contentation meet together. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1 He is rich, whom God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth rich, and that is the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Hee is rich, who hath enough, not who hath much. For it is better to have enough, then to have much: and he hath enough whose estate agrees with his minde: As he is poore, not who hath little, but who not being sufficed is ever craving more. <hi>Ahab</hi> had a Kingdome, yet was not content without poore <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths</hi> Vineyard: whereas <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi> had but a little, yet was so content and rich, as he wished not the Kings substance. Of every poore godly man may be said, as the Spirit speakes of the Church
<pb facs="tcp:43759:10"/>
of <hi>Smyrna, Revelat. 2.</hi> verse <hi>9. I know thy poverty, but thou art rich.</hi> This it is, which makes a man whole without health, warme without cloathes, and in cause of outward heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to be glad. Whereas with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it men turne peace into trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, riches into poverty, health in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sicknesse. No happinesse where contentment dwels not. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience lets our eyes see many of them, whom the world hath with her best meanes made as happy as it can, yet pressed downe with the weight of their owne felicity, thinking themselves unhappy sad, and complaining, and cannot tell of what. It is nothing for <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom</hi> to be the Kings sonne, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he may have the Crowne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently from his fathers head. <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> can abide no superiour, nor <hi>Pompey</hi> an equall.</p>

               <p n="1">1 The multitude of mercies in God, who is rich in mercy, as able and willing to forgive <hi>ten thousand talents</hi> as one, as in the parable of the servant indebted, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 27. all is one with him. He hath a <hi>multitude of mercies</hi> and compassions, and will <note place="margin">Psal. 51. 1.</note> cast all our sins into the <hi>bottome of the Sea. Isaac</hi> had but one blessing in <note place="margin">Mic. 7. 19.</note> comparison of this multiplicity.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Oppose the price, value, and merit of the Blood of Christ, which <note place="margin">2 1 Ioh. 1. 7</note> 
                  <hi>cleanseth from all sins,</hi> be they never so many. We are not redeemed with <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 19.</note> corruptible things, as silver and gold,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43759:27"/>
but the <hi>precious Blood of Iesus Christ.</hi> And if the blood of Bulls and Goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkled on the uncleane, sanctified as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the purifying of the flesh, how much more shall the <hi>blood of Christ,</hi> who through the eternall spirit offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himselfe without spot, <hi>purge the conscience from dead workes to serve</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 9. 13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>the living God?</hi> This blood is never dry, the vertue of it never wasted: the good Samaritan will pay all.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The promise of God is, that <note place="margin">3</note> upon our repentance the multitude of our sinnes shall be no barre to his mercy, <hi>Ezek. 18. 21. If the wicked man shall turne from all his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, all his transgressions shall not be mentioned unto him.</hi> Nay rather, where <hi>sin abounds, grace shall super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abound,</hi> Rom. 5. 20.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Mercy pleaseth him, yea, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinted <note place="margin">4 Mat. 18. 21.</note> mercy: when <hi>Peter</hi> asked our Saviour, how oft his brother offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding should be pardoned, whether unto seven times, our Saviour answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>I say not unto thee, till seven times, but unto seventy times seven times,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:43759:28"/>
that is, so oft as he repenteth. If God require in man (in whom is but a drop of mercy) that he should not pardon by tale and number, but, so oft as the brother returneth, he must have all forgiven; how much more must the Lord, <hi>whose wayes are above</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 55. 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>mans,</hi> and with whom is the Ocean of mercy, and who delighteth in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then mercy, be infinite and unstinted in pardoning when we truely returne?</p>
               <p>Indeed the number of our sinnes is such, as may well set us in a maze, and astonish us: and when wee see them grow to so great a reckoning, if the Lord did pardon by number, and not beyond such a number, wee might sinke under them: But when when we see him a Chirurgion that hath salve enough for all wounds, and infinite playsters of compassion to heale all our sinnes; this upholds us, and make us sue to him for pardon. We have a sea of rebellions, but he hath a farre more bottomelesse sea of compassions to drowne them in.</p>

               <p n="5">5 It is good for a Christian to be hated of the world for well-doing. First, for the triall of his sincerity, whether he will hold out with Christ. Secondly, to weane him

from the world, and lift up his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to heaven; whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he is hardly plucked from the breasts of it. Thirdly, to fence against many alluring temptations. Is it possible to have familiar conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation with a wanton Harlot, and not be inveigled with her bands and snares? The smiles of an enemie are worse then the wounds of a friend. Were we friends with the world, we should walke together; which is not safe, seeing the whole world lyeth in wickednesse. Fourthly, it forceth the Christian to get and keepe God his friend, the onely shield against the worlds hatred: as <hi>Abraham</hi> was called <hi>the friend of God, Iam.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Fiftly, it is a testimony, and spurre to him in goodnesse, to have wicked men his enemies. Hee is a good man who carries the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of evill ones.</p>
               <p>From these grounds a godly heart will thus conclude. Was Christ
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43759:37"/>
hated in the world? is the cause such, because I run not the wayes of the world? and because I am chosen out of the world? Have I professed hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to it in my baptisme? Will God take my part, and give me victory? yea, is it overcome already? Doth God bring me such light out of darknesse, and his owne love and friendship out of the worlds frownes and hatred?

If they called the Master <hi>Belzebub,</hi> may they well not call me <hi>Divell?</hi> is the Disciple above his Lord? <hi>Matthew</hi> 10. <hi>verse</hi> 24.</p>
               <p n="2">2 I suffer not this reproach as an <note place="margin">2</note> evill doer, nor of good, but evill men: and therefore I am neither sorrowfull, nor ashamed.

This contented <hi>David, Psal. 69. 7. for thy sake</hi> have I suffered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, and shame hath covered my face. See <hi>Esa.</hi> 8. 18. and <hi>Iere.</hi> 20. 7. So a godly heart hath the testimony of a good conscience, that it hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven no just cause, but suffereth for Gods sake: thence contentment. How glad may a good heart be, when it can appeale to God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him to witnesse the innocency of it?</p>
               <p n="3">3 It appeares not now, what <note place="margin">3</note> godly men are: their worth is not known: therefore are they coursely used. But the time comes, wherein it shall be manifest what they are, 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 1, 2.

me to be his sonne? what care I, if the sonnes of men turne my glory into shame? There is a day, when it shall appeare that I am a sonne of God. A Pearl cast into dust or clay, loseth not the vertue, nor the shine; but a day will finde it, and see it in the due price of it: So the godly, now darkened in the dirt of calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, at length shall be revealed, and according to their worth respected. In the meane time we must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that our glory be hid, even as our Lords was. And indeed, shame and infamy from evill men is no shame, but a crowne: <hi>Iob</hi> would carry the booke of libels upon his shoulders, <hi>as an ornament, c.</hi> 31. 36.</p>

               <p>The Crosses of severall Callings. are sundry and burthensome, which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43759:50"/>
sometime so distract men, that they are ready to cast off all. But godlinesse worketh contentment against them, on these grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It judgeth aright, which are <note place="margin">1</note> true Crosses of the Calling indeed, and not rather vices of the person ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising it. It wil be sure it be a crosse. For some men thinke so well of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as they grow discontent with their calling, as not sufficient or good enough for their deserts, and so affect higher places, which oftentimes they are crossed in. But this is the ambition and vice of the person, and not a cross of the calling. Againe, it is common, that men thinke themselves greatly crossed, if they see one whom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves judge equal, or inferior to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to be placed in an an higher place then themselves, &amp; so vexe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and are troubled if they rise not to his pitch at the least. But this is but the envy of the person, not the crosse of the calling. But if godlinesse step in, it will teach that callings are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed, not for the private, but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke and common good: and that the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43759:50"/>
greater place a man is in, the greater is the charge, and the straiter the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It teacheth a man, that every <note place="margin">2</note> one must walke in a personall calling, in performing the duties, of which he must avoyd both idlenesse, which omitteth the duties of it, and <hi>sloth</hi> which doth them negligently, It is a generall law, In the sweat of thy <note place="margin">Gen. 3 19.

Secondly, to teach men to begin their calling with God, that they may bee able to say, God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>vate course should not want admonitions and motives, to joyne his generall and speciall calling together. Fourthly, that he should sanctifie it by the word and prayer, which is a daily arming of himselfe against these troubles.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Godlinesse beateth backe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience and discontent, when a man <note place="margin">4</note> is opposed and reviled by men for doing his duty. A great tryall: but Godlinesse holds up the heart to God

as to the owne Lord, and makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the workes of the calling, not so much to men as to God. Also it makes a man intend them in love to men as well as faith in God: so as the offence is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Further, when a man is crossed in his calling, that all his labour will scarse maintaine his mouth, and is stil kept under poverty, here is a great trouble, but godlinesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe second sort of trialls concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our selves, which godlines fenceth the heart against, respecteth our estates: reduced to three heads; namely, the want or losse, <list>

               </p>
               <p>In the want or losse of riches, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse perswadeth contentment, thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:43759:55"/>
First, it turneth up the eyes of the soule unto God, and beholdeth in him many things, all which afford sweet contentment: as,</p>
               <p>First, his providence and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling hand, in which are the heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the earth and creatures. It is he that layeth the lines for the sonnes of men: but his eye especially is upon them that feare him, to whom so long as he granteth them life, hee will provide sufficient maintenance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, his affection to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is such, as cannot let them want what is fit for them. For, whom he chose to be his children before they were, and those for whom he sent his Son, being enemies, will he withhold good things from them, being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled? Hence Christ perswadeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, <hi>Mat. 6. 31. your heavenly father knoweth what you stand in need of.</hi> Marke the Evangelist saith not, <hi>God</hi> knoweth, but <hi>your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> by that loving name the more to strengthen and assure us, that if wee who are evill, can give to our children good things, much more our heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43759:55"/>
Father will give good things to his children, asking them of him. <hi>Can a mother forget her childe, &amp;c. Esa.</hi> 49. 15. no, say as <hi>David, the Lord is my shepherd, I shal want nothing. Ps.</hi> 23, 1.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, his unchangable truth, which never faileth, but standeth for ever. He hath promised that <hi>no good thing shall be wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that feare him;</hi> but he will increase their stock &amp; state <hi>in his time, viz.</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it shal make for his glory &amp; their good. <hi>Ioseph</hi> was made next man unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that without him none should lift up his hand or foot in al the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: but he must first be sold of his brethren, accused of his mistresse, bound fast in the prison, where the irons entred into his soule. Our Saviour Christ did not presently turne the water into wine at his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers desire, because <hi>his houre was not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 24.</note> 
                  <hi>come.</hi> If Gods houre be come, thou shalt see thy water turned into wine, thy want into wealth: or else he will give great blessing on small meanes, that the <hi>little which the just man hath,</hi> shall be better then the abundance of <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 8.</note> the wicked.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:43759:56"/>
Secondly, it looketh up to Christ our head, who was poor, and had not where to <hi>lay his head,</hi> when Foxes had their holes, and Birds their nests, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 20. And many of the faithfull were ever <hi>poore,</hi> or else <hi>made</hi> poore, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. and 11. 37. Yea the stock of Christ, the posterity of King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> of whom <hi>Ioseph</hi> &amp; <hi>Mary</hi> came, were brought to great poverty: and yet it never impeached the promise, or love of God to that family. Yea Christ hath sanctified our want and poverty: and as his Father loved him never the worse for it, no more doth he his members. Hee accepts not the person of the rich or poore because they are so, but in <hi>every nation</hi> he that <note place="margin">Act. 10. 135.</note> feares him and workes righteousnesse is accepted of him. To him a godly poor man is in more request then wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Kings.</p>

               <p n="2">2 Godlinesse causeth the heart <note place="margin">2 Good ends for this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</note> to looke unto Gods ends, and so, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes to better it selfe:</p>
               <p>As, first, to supply wants of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with increase of grace: so <hi>Zache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> being low of stature, climbed up into a tree to see Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by imperfections and deformity of body to see and hate the deformity of soul by sinne, which was the Parent of it. <hi>Lots</hi> wife for her sinne was turned into a senselesse pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43759:62"/>
of salt. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> for his sinne was made in conversation like a beast. Good <hi>Zachary</hi> for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust was made speechlesse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, not to rest in our selves, since wee have a continuall badge of imperfection, but in the perfection of Christ, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 9. my grace is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thee.</hi> And so much the more to labour in the decking of the soule, that the Lords strength may be perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted through weaknesse.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Faith teacheth the heart, and <note place="margin">3</note> upholdeth it unto that time, when all imperfections and blemishes shall be done away. For when sinne shall bee cast into the lake, all the deformities and infirmities of it shall bee aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and soule and body shall be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in most absolute perfection and beauty, in the resurrection of the just: and that body which is now far wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of other mens in feature and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, shall be made like the glorious body of Iesus Christ. That eye which is now blinde or blemished, shall perfectly and cleerely behold God as he is, and see his Redeemer.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43759:63"/>
The stammering tongue shal resound the praises of the Lord in all eternity. The lame shall bee restored to his limbes, to walk in white with Christ. And that body which is now defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yet is now a member of Christ, and shall bring no blemish to Christs glorious body.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Deformity of body may be a blemish in respect of man, it is not so <note place="margin">4</note> in regard of God: for he judgeth not acording to the outward appearance, but according to the frame of the heart. For as in a wicked man the Lord seeth no beauty, but accounteth of them as if they were transformed into the shape of beasts <hi>(Nero</hi> a lion for cruelty, <hi>Herod</hi> a foxe for craft and subtilty, and <hi>Peter</hi> calleth them dogs and swine for filthinesse:) so the Lord seeth no deformity in the godly, but of the church consisting of her mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, is said, <hi>Thou art all faire my love, thers is no blemish in thee.</hi> Beauty <note place="margin">Cant. 4. 7.</note> without Gods feare is as a Pearle in a swines snout: but Gods feare without beauty of body is as a Diamond, which is never lesse pretious if it
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43759:63"/>
were set in clay.</p>
               <p n="5">5 If deformity come by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <note place="margin">5</note> as by persecution of Tyrants, by racking, dismembring, or the like, godlinesse will make a man content; yea, and glad he is worthy to <hi>beare the markes of Christ Iesus in his body:</hi> so was <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 6. 17. These defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are rather ornaments to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. And seeing our Lord did beare in his body the print of the speare and nayles, why should we be ashamed of the like? Nay, these markes have been highly esteemed of Gods children. We read in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall history, that <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperour kissed the wounds of their eyes, which in time of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution were pulled out for constant bearing witnesse to the truth, and <note place="margin">Theodlib. 1 cap. 2.</note> received and entertained them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably. The markes of a souldiers wounds for his King and Countrey, are his glory.</p>
               <p>But if deformity or defect come otherwise, a godly heart resteth it selfe in this, that all things fall out and shall be turned to the best <hi>to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43759:64"/>
them that love God.</hi> God can in his wisedome tell how to prevent grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evill from his children, by Jesse, and to draw them good out of evill. For example: <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> was lame by birth, but God disposed it to good for him. If he had been of a strong and able body, it was likely enough hee might have affected his Grandfathers Kingdome, as his uncle <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> did to his owne destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but now being lame, and unfit for the Kingdome, he is contented with his condition, without any aspiring attempts, and so lives in peace long dayes and to old age, who else might have perished yong. Experience gives us store of examples of such as being like <hi>Absalom,</hi> who was the fairest young man in all Israel, of strength and valour, it had bin better for them to have been perpetually lame or bed-rid, then have enjoyed that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, which not being able to weild hath proved their overthrow.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. Of Orbity or Barrennesse, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment therein.</head>
               <p>THe second personall evill, in <note place="margin">Grounds of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Barrennes.</note> which godlinesse no lesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth then in the former, is Orbity or Barrennesse. Thus.</p>
               <p>First, promotion of children makes <note place="margin">1</note> none blessed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, children are not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <note place="margin">2</note> blessings, nor alwayes given for a blessing, but often prove a curse, <hi>Iob</hi> 27. 15, 16. Wee read of children multiplied for the sword, and for famine. Wee often see some one childe, not onely the sorrow and shame of godly Parents, but the ruine and overthrow of the whole family. Wee have heard of <hi>Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loms</hi> that have risen in rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their parents, according to our Saviours prophecy, <hi>Matthew, 10. 21. children shall rise up against their Parents.</hi> Better were it to bee without Children, then
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43759:65"/>
to be parents of such, as for whom the Lord made a Law, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents should follow them to the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and cast the first stone at them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 18, 19, 20. Numbers of such roiotous sons are every where at this day.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the case often so fals out, that they are at best <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ase, who have <note place="margin">3</note> no children; especially if troubles and persecutions arise for the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. When Ierusalem was to bee besieged, woe was to them that gave sucke in those dayes. And in ordinary times, the Parent charged with children must have trouble in the flesh, for the godly educating, and also providing for them. And such as have none, have lesse care, and more liberty and opportunity to serve God, &amp; to care for the things of God, how he may please him: the Apostles reason, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 32, 34.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, children are the gift of God. The fruit of the wombe is <note place="margin">4</note> a blessing from God, whose wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is such, as he disposeth them where he knoweth it is fit for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43759:65"/>
and good for his children: and where it would make for neither, he withholdeth them. <hi>Elkanah</hi> was not God, to give <hi>Annah</hi> children. And a good heart will rest in Gods wise disposition, who openeth, and no man shutteth, and shutteth the wombe and no man can open it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, though sometimes it was <note place="margin">5</note> a curse to be childelesse, and infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for sinne, as <hi>Coniah</hi> was <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43759:66"/>
how much health' (which is next to life, the best earthly blessing of God) is overprized. But godlinesse suggesteth many motives to content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in this estate.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It looketh up unto the hand <note place="margin">1</note> of our Father, lovingly chastening in measure, not above our strength; in mercy, not to our desert; and to a good end, for his <hi>own glory,</hi> as <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his sicknesse was, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 4. and for our glory too, even as our Head Christ must first suffer, and so enter into his glory, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Sicknesse is the Lords schoole, wherin we learne not only the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but the practise of many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <note place="margin">The good uses of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. 1</note> vertues.</p>
               <p>First, it telleth us, that wee carry about with us a body subject to death, upon which sentence is past, that being dust it must returne to dust. It sheweth the frailty of man by bringing downe the lustiest bodies, abating the strength, and abolishing the beauty of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it humbles men, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">2</note> a confession from them, that all
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43759:66"/>
flesh is but as grasse, and the grace thereof as the flower of the field.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it abates selfe love in men, <note place="margin">3</note> and tames the ranke flesh, when health, strength and prosperity lift up the minde, and make men over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weane themselves, and kicke against the Lord.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, sicknesse of the body is the medicine of the soule, which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours <note place="margin">4</note> more with weaknesse of faith, hope, love, then the body with disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. And therefore as physick, though it be unpleasant to the Patient, yet is profitable, so is it with the sicknesse of the body to the soule: For then (as all men can witnesse of themselves) they are most wise, most humble, most sorrowfull for sinne, most earnest for pardon, most fervent in prayer, most watchfull against sinne, and in one word, best affected in soule in the sicknesse of the body. Did not <hi>Naamans</hi> sicknesse of lep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>osie bring him to the Prophet <hi>Elisha,</hi> where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing healed he confesseth there was no God in the world, but in Israel? 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 15, 16. Was not that a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43759:67"/>
most notable prayer of <hi>Ezekiah</hi> in his sicknesse? <hi>Esa.</hi> 38. 9. How many hearty prayers did <hi>David</hi> poure out to the Lord in his sicknesse? <hi>Psal.</hi> 6. and 32. and 38. Looke upon <hi>Iob</hi> in his sicknesse, a mirrour of patience, confidence, humility, other holy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and as a modell of grace he came tryed and refined out of the furnace.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, sicknesse is a preservative <note place="margin">5</note> against many sinnes; in that it makes us thinke of the cause of sickenesse, which is sinne; and of earnest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the waster of sinne; and of seeking to the Physitian of soules, which is Christ himselfe, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a confection of his owne heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloud to cure all our sinnes, which are our spirituall diseases and sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, in that it lets us see that the house of this Tabernacle must <note place="margin">6</note> be dissolved, it moveth us to bid adieu to the world, and seeke for that life which is everlasting, not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of age, sickenesse, or any grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. The nurse in weaning the childe layeth mustard on her breast:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43759:67"/>
And this life must have some bitter tang, to make us seeke for a better.</p>
               <p>Were not my sicknesse so lingring <note place="margin">

               <p n="1">1 Thou lingrest in the cause, which is thy sinne. Hasten thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2 See thou get soundnesse of <note place="margin">2</note> soule so much the more, and the spirit of a man will beare his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Make sure remission of sins, get faith, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Christ hath not taken away the lingring of diseases, but the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity <note place="margin">3</note> and poison of them. It may long exercise and molest thee, it shall not hurt thee, nay bee turned to the best: neither can the sicknesse belong, where the life is so short.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Perhaps thou hast abused or <note place="margin">4</note> forfeited thy health, or wouldst abuse it to Gods dishonour. See wee not numbers, it were better for them to be bound on their beds, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually sicke or bedrid, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to pursue wickednesse with high hand as they doe? And assure
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43759:68"/>
thy selfe, were health as good for thee as it is in it selfe, thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest have it. Better to bee broken with griefe to salvation, then enjoy health to condemnation.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Thinke not God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thee, if hee longer hold thee <note place="margin">5</note> under. Looke upon that godly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that laboured of a bloudy is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue <hi>eighteene yeares,</hi> and was bowed together, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 8. Another whom Christ cured, that had an issue <hi>twelve yeares, c.</hi> 8. 43. Behold the man that was lame <hi>thirty eight yeres, Iohn</hi> 5. 5. And <hi>Aeneas</hi> that was sick of the palsie eight yeares, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 33. and yet were respected and cured in due season.</p>
               <p>But of all examples, most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable is that of our Lord and <note place="margin">Esa. 53. 3.</note> Head, Gods deare Sonne, who was a <hi>man of sorrowes,</hi> and his whole life nothing but a burthen of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes: and never was any sorrow like unto his, and yet he ceased not to be deare to his Father. And the same is the condition of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. <note place="margin">6</note>

Lastly, God hath just causes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <note place="margin">6 Why God suffereth sicknesse to linger long on his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. 1 2</note> help, and seem to hide himselfe.</p>

               <p n="2">2 It seeth the death of Beleevers, <note place="margin">sanctifies it:</note> not onely altered, but sanctified by Christs death: that it becomes of a curse a blessing, and as a stage where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Christian manifesteth his faith, fortitude, love, patience, and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and openly triumpheth over death, as his Head hath done before him.</p>

               <p>Another necessity of death is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause without it wee can never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine immortality and eternall life.

               <p n="1">1 Because it is an end of all evils and wretchednesse.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Because it is a beginning of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and happinesse.</p>
               <p>For the former:</p>
               <p n="1">1 It is an end of misery, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, <note place="margin">1 An end of all misery 4 wayes.</note> cares, feares, teares: an end of sicknesse, paine, poverty, shame, persecution, and the like: for in death attended with teares, God wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth away all teares from the eyes of his children: and then shall bee <hi>no more death, neither sorrow, nor wecping, nor paine, Rev.</hi> 21. 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It is an end of temptations by Satan. The soule in this world is in the bonds and snares of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and the law of sinne in the members ministreth strength to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan against our selves.

               <p n="4">4 It is an end of our owne pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 19 Heb. 11. 13.</note> and absence from the Lord, wherein wee stand in so doubtfull and dangerous a battell, not onely with enemies without us, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our owne bosome, our owne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse, wrath, ambition, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuousnesse, lust, envy; and not a head can bee cut off from this Hydra, but another riseth in the roome: and no watch can be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient

               <p>Now what man being absent from his owne house doth not long to dispatch his businesse, so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home? And thus the Saints, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 2.

               <p>First, that by these two wee are raised, as by two stayres, to the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of full happinesse. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there be three degrees of life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;</p>

Secondly, because the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <note place="margin">2</note> Christ and the Christian la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth, and cannot be dissolved when death dissolveth all naturall bonds: for the bond is mysticall and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, neither knitteth the soule onely to Christ the Head, but the body also even the whole person: so as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the faithfull, being dead and turned into dust many thousand yeres agoe remaine the members of Christ; still cared for by the Head, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be <hi>made like to his glorious body, by that mighty power whereby hee is able to subdue all things to him selfe, Phil.</hi> 3. 21. In the winter, all the sap being in the root, there appeares no difference betweene a living tree and a dead: but in the spring there is a sap which will ascend, and revive the decayed branches. So our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies turned not to nothing, but to dust, and devoured, by beasts, fishes, or the elements, seeme to bee peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, but by reason of the former union must bee raised, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the glorious life of Christ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as the death of the god ly
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43759:76"/>
is a quiet sleep, so the grave is a resting chamber, yea a sweet bed perfumed by Christs buriall for the bodies of all the Elect; out of which they must awake (for the earth and sea must give up their dead) and bee admitted into the presence of God, and of Christ. Neither can the grave ever hold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the members of Christ, no more then it could their Head: but as he gloriously rose againe from the dead, so shall they in glory and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Much lesse can the grave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the body, of which Christ hath said, <hi>O grave, I will bee thy</hi>

               <p n="1">1 Consider the <hi>affection</hi> of God, If thou beest as thou professest, Gods childe, he is thy father, and thou, if thou beest a good childe, wilt relye on him, and content thy selfe with his allowance. Every master of a family may dispose his goods as he pleaseth.</p>

               <p>And both these our Saviour <hi>(Mat.</hi> 6. 32.) coucheth together to worke contentment: <hi>your heavenly Father knoweth, what ye stand in need of.</hi> He that can give riches without content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, knowes also to give content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without riches.

               <head>CHAP. XXI. Of the power of godlinesse to breed contentment, whence it is.</head>
               <p>VVHereas in the former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course <note place="margin">Whence godlinesse hath power make con tented.</note> we have referred the whole strength and benefit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment unto godlinesse, it will be good in the close of this Treatise to enquire, wherein the great power of this <hi>Sampson</hi> lyeth, and whence it is, that godlinesse draweth so great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to give the Contentment above specified.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>without controversie, great is the mystery of godlinesse: God was manifest in the flesh, &amp;c. 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 16. And this is the foundation of al Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, even God incarnate, God with us, God in our nature, Iehovah our righteousnesse, our Peace-maker, our Advocate and Mediatour, our King, Priest &amp; Prophet, our portion and great reward; wholly ours, what ever he is, or hath, or can doe,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43759:82"/>
or hath done, or suffered, to make us happy; as namely redemption, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliation, justification, adoption, &amp; all his benefits. These are complete every way, &amp; adequate to the nature, need, and desire of man. Mans soule, being a divine particle, is infinite in desires, and cannot be satisfied but with an infinite good. This good is not to be found in any creature, nor in all the creatures put together, which are all finite, &amp; changeable, and if God pleased, reducible to their first no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Onely the glorious and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite God can give satisfiction to the soule, and make it rest in his love, as a contentfull and sufficient Object of delight. After the resurrection, and in his heavenly kingdome, there is an absolute fulnesse to the creature in the fruition of the Creator: as <hi>Psal. 17. 15. I shall be satisfied when I awake, with thy likenesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here in this life the onely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is by faith, which layeth hold on the promises, and on Christ by whom God is certainely and comfortably made ours: that though
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43759:82"/>
there was a great breach made by mans sinne, God estranged and provoked infinitely, the creatures yeelding vexation of spirit, the best not able to helpe, nor man to helpe himselfe; yet now, upon atonement made, the Lord wholly returnes to man, with all the good he hath and is able to doe for him: <hi>Genesis 17. 1. When Abram was ninety yeeres old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am God all suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, walke before me, and be thou up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and I will make my Covenant betweene me and thee, and I will mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply thee exceedingly.</hi> Afterward, as this Covenant is more firmely beleeved, and application of the promises more stedfastly made, and assurance of Gods love more comfortably gathered; the beleeving soule growes to bee more quiet, and filled with joy unspeakeable, and full of glory; and, seeing God hath dealt so graciously with it in the maine, therefore whatsoever shall bee his portion of temporall or spirituall
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43759:83"/>
gifts, it will be well contented, and rest satisfied. Not an attribute of God, but yeelds abundant matter of sweet repose in the bosome of our heavenly Father: infinite mercy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power, infinite holinesse, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wisedome, infinite truth, every excellency infinite and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, must needs ravish and swallow up the soule with infinite admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and contentation.</p>

perfectest good, being the end of all our actions: and perfectest, because it is sufficient to it selfe, without any further desireable good. But this they affirmed blindely, not reaching at that which is the top of mans felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore fell into other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of perfect vertue, perfect life, contemplation and the pleasure thereof, and the society of man, by the which they expected their blessednesse. Onely the beleever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines this <hi>autarkey,</hi> being in fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient Iehova; and this blessednesse, because his sins are forgiven, and his person accepted in Christ, and withall enriched with so goodly endowments, that he may well be both contented and thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full abundantly.</p>

                  </gap>n do you go about to comfort an impenitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and worke him to Contentment in such and such afflictions. Your first labours should be, to drive him out of himselfe, and get him to make his peace with God, in whom alone he can obtaine a sufficient stay and supply for his sad condition. True: numbers content themselves with their riches, honors, friends, children, other comforts: but how often is it seene, that one <hi>Mordecai</hi> not bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (one slight crosse or other) marres <note place="margin">Est. 5. 13.</note> the fashion of all their glory? and, though the evill spirit goe from <hi>Saul</hi> at the Musicke which <hi>David</hi> makes, yet soone afterward he returns again, and torments him as much as ever?
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43759:84"/>
Adde hereunto the pricking thornes of covetousnesse, the gnawing paines of envie, the torturing fits of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, fury, frenzie, which often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the seemliest Contentment of a naturall man. All which doth hold, even in the stollen waters of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who either in the Ministery or by private conference receive a prop for their miserable estate, that they are both contented and comfortable; yet, for want of Christ dwelling in the heart by faith, they soone returne to their old distempers, or after a while shew plainely they used a wrong phrase or method for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, godlinesse hath this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note place="margin">2</note> to breed Contentment in all estates, while it is of power to change a man into another man, by the grace of regeneration and conversion unto God: thrusting the old man out of doores, and putting the new man into pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, which after GOD is created in knowledge, righteousnesse, and true holinesse: laying the foundation
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43759:85"/>
of all in selfe-deniall, in resigning the owne will to the will of God, and in care to please him, though himselfe and all the world be displeased. None but the new creatur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Another hath his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified and unsubdued passions (in the goodliest civility that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Art, or Education can afford) which in time of vehement trouble wil have a vent, and make a great commotion in the soule and life. Well may such discourse of the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the quieting of them; but shall never obtaine what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, till they consult Religion and power of godlinesse, which sets up a new frame in the soule, in which Contentment may be harboured.</p>
               <p>It is true: sundry godly persons are many times distempered, and subject to great discontents. But this is onely by the imperfection of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse. If they were so good as they might be, and should be, they should not so often goe out of tune as they doe. As any are <hi>partakers of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>

                  <hi>nature</hi> more fully, so they are
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43759:85"/>
more rid of these discontents. They that have learned well to deny their owne will, wisedome, reason, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall resonings, have learned also to be quiet in greatest afflictions, as those holy men, It is the Lord, let him doe as he pleases: and, good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken. Pride, passion, selfe-willednesse, envy, earthlinesse, other corruptions being almost dead and gasping, needs must the soule remaine in good temper and quietnesse; as the Sea is quiet, when no windes are abroad to tosse it. Whereunto adde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> strength of faith, of hope, of patience, of humility, and other graces, which as godlinesse bringeth nearer to their perfection, so the soule shall have more benefite by them to rest wel contented with Gods good pleasure in every thing. And the very exercises of godlinesse (when rightly performed) are nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diversions to put off discontents: the Christian can fall to prayer when he is likely to be surprised with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, anger, feare, or the like passion, can sit and sing a Psalme, can take a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:43759:86"/>
Bible and read a Chapter, can goe and conferre with his Minister, or some faithfull friend; and thus, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other imployment, he forgets the matter of discontent. And, is it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Gods will, that he should not be more rich, healthy, high, befrien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, accommodated with outward blessings, or endowed with inward gifts of the Spirit, better ability of minde, &amp;c? his will is laid down long ago, and therefore he can traffick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly with his two Talents, as wel as another with his ten. Not my will, but thy will be done, O Father.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, godlinesse (after those two <note place="margin">3</note> things so setled, I mean justification &amp; sanctification) hath power to frame the heart to Contentment by those manifold Rules of Christian mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which we have above rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: all being Shields and Targets out of the Lords Armory, able to guard and keepe the heart in the love of God, against all assaults of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, godlinesse proposeth, <note place="margin">

                  </note> and also perswadeth the heart of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43759:86"/>
excellency of spiritual things; namely the favour of God, the image of God, the providence of God, his Son, his spirit, his Angels, his Word, his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures sanctified, his corrections miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and made profitable, his glory worth having, thogh we stay long for it, &amp; though in the mean time we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure many and sharp trials. When the palate is oncein a good relish (as god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines is able to set it) it finds the Word in all the blessed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tents of it sweeter <note place="margin">Psal. 19. 10.

Now the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is able to make a right estimate of things, and be affected toward them according to their worth. A world of advantage, above men of the world.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, godlinesse doth two things <note place="margin">5</note> about earthly matters, which are the ordinary causes of discontent. One, to shew the vanity of them: that they are the slenderest and slightest fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which God bestowes on his
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43759:87"/>
children, and many times thinkes good to bestow most largely on his very enemies: Which if we shall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and earnestly thinke of, we shall be the better contented either to want them, or be scanted in them. The like of cSmon gifts, of illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, memory, utterance, eloquence, courtlinesse, and the like. The other, to teach us to accustome our selves to have what we have, <hi>as if we posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not,</hi> and to use the world <hi>as not using it,</hi> namely, with much weigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and retyrednesse, as those that are forced to make use of them, and not those that come willingly and eagerly to an enjoyment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 30, 31. Contempt of the world brought some of the Philosophers to a strange kinde of resolution, for quieting their mindes in all sad accidents. Pitty it should not doe the like for true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, who have better Principles, better Evidences and matters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and better assurance of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and felicity of heaven.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, godlinesse teacheth, that <note place="margin">6</note> we must goe farther then Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43759:87"/>
namely, to be thankefull and blesse God, even for afflictions: to rejoyce in the Lord alwayes: to count it a mercy, that we are not consumed, and already in hell: to esteeme our selves lesse then the least of all Gods mercies: to rejoyce in tribulations, and account it all joy when we fall into divers temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: to make our selves equall to them of the lower sort, who, though they deserve as much as we, or more, yet fare not so well: and, How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deare children hath God in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places, who would be glad of our scraps, together with the peace of our Sion, and prosperity of the Gospell? And finally, to suffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions with Ioy and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as did the Martyrs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors in those bitter dayes: which how shall they doe, who have not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Contentment in a better and quieter condition? they that cannot runne with a footman, how can they thinke to keepe company with an Horseman?</p>

Plut.</note> of skill or care, in the midst of great meanes are very beggers and bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts in grace, finde nothing to doe, and all the day long stand idle in the market-place. For whose better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, I will in few words shew, that the LORD ordereth such a multitude of good occasions to waite on every part of our life, for doing good to our selves or others, that if we were wise to apprehend and take them up, no houre of our many daies could passeus without accomplishing some notable good,</p>
               <p>First, what time is there, in which <note place="margin">Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of good.</note> the Lord holds not out one benefit or other to us, spirituall or temporall, wherwith he stretcheth out his hands all the day long? Where can a man goe, but he enjoyes the creatures of God, the Sunne, the ayre, meate drinke, or the like helpes of nature, or of grace? Where may he not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these benefits, to provoke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to thankfulnesse? <hi>Lord what is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43759:90"/>
man, that thou art mindefull of him, or the sonne of man, that thou visitest him! Psal.</hi> 8. 4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, where shall a man goe, but he may finde an altar to offer the <note place="margin">2</note> sacrifice of almes, even some object of mercy? and <hi>with such sacrifices God is well pleased, Heb.</hi> 13. Oh how might an able man (that is willing withall) be ever furthering his rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, and drawing on himselfe the prayers of poore Saints, and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God himselfe who is ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating his goodnesse to the creature! and in conclusion, helpe himselfe into everlasting habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, through the day a man <note place="margin">3</note> may meet with some rubbes, crosses, afflictions: And how should these help to keep him humble &amp; lowly in his owne eyes, and set him a new on examining his owne heart, and turne all other sorrow into godly sorrow, for sinne which is the cause of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, at other times God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth <note place="margin">4</note> cause of rejoycing for some
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:43759:91"/>
blessing on a mans selfe or his, or some speciall worke of mercy to the land, to the countrey where he lives, to the Church, to the Churches abroad, &amp;c: And now a Psalme would relish well. <hi>David</hi> would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rise at midnight to praise the Lord, then slip such a season: and would ask himselfe, <hi>What shall I render unto the Lord? Psalme</hi> 116. 12.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, sometimes through the day a Christian may heare of, or see the <note place="margin">5</note> misery and affliction of others, in their soules or bodies. And now if he would goe into the <hi>house of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccles 7. 2.</note> hee might come forth wiser, more mortified, more weined from the world, more fit for death, and for giving up his accounts with joy. And to put on bowels of compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, remembring the afflictions of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> and be affected as true and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling members use to be, would argue him a sound and living member of that mysticall body whereof Christ is the head.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, who is he, that hath not <note place="margin">6</note>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:43759:91"/>
some good motion through the day, by meanes of the Spirit moving with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or the Word sounding without, or some other occasion from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe or others, by conference or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample? Now were a good time to worke with God, to follow the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit whither soever he leadeth, to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster his motions, and cheerefully and readily goe on in holy obedience, even to perfection. While the Sun shines, make Hay. Take the Tyde of grace: perhaps it will not bee long.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, sometimes a man is <note place="margin">7</note> solitary: and then the most know not what to doe with themselves, but consume their time in roving and ranging thoughts: whereas now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Christian may watch and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his owne greatest advantage: Now that he is alone, separated from company and businesse, he may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden his soule of sinne in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, by free confession. In any want he may be bold with God, in as powerfull manner as hee can: and freely enjoy his fellowship, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43759:92"/>
communing with God, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction. And, can that man bee alone, who is with God in the mount? Or if the heathen could say hee was <hi>never lesse alone then when alone,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Nunquam minùs sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Eighthly, sometimes in the day he is in company, and then he shal make use of his time, to waite for some fit occasion that he may speake of the workes of God which are fresh in memory.

               <p>IT is true: our time is short and vaine, even as a day; and by our sinne it is full of vanity and vexation of spirit: yet withall, it is most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and if it be well employed, it is a gainfull day. <hi>Moses</hi> maketh so

We number things of value. Men tell money af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their father: and if there bee a small piece of suspected coyne, they touch, and try, and weigh, and will be sure of the currence of it: reason teaching them sensibly, that mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king brings an apparent losse. So for our dayes, times, and opportunities of good, the Lord teacheth to weigh them, and be well advised before we part with them, and not exchange them without something answerable to their worth.</p>
               <p>Even the dimme light of Nature and common experience teacheth men to set a dear rate and reckoning of time, for some outward profit to be gotten by it. One utters his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pophthegme, <hi>No day without a line,</hi>

               <p>The husbandman observes his seasons accurately, and it is his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome so to reckon of his seasons, as that the Seed-time slip him not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath sowen, nor his harvest come upon him before he be ready; and this he watcheth and provideth for, because he seeth these times yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him againe and increase which he will not lose. The like of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant and all other occupiers: they know not the place onely where, but their season when their commodities may be had at best hand, and will not come short in times of their chiefe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne: they will be sure the ships shall not be gone, before their packs be ready: and all because they see an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and increase of outward profit.

               <p>
                  <hi>TO number our dayes</hi> may seeme <note place="margin">God alone teacheth, rightly to prize time.</note> easie, and soone done: yet is no such plaine point of knowledge, but of singular skill, which none but God can teach. Moses himselfe, a man of greatest reach, and learned in all the learning of the Egyptians, the man of God, an holy man, a friend of God, can neither teach himselfe this skill, nor any other of Gods people, but goes to God to be taught; who challengeth to be the God hearing prayer, and in the <hi>want of Wisdome</hi> hath appointed his servants to come and <hi>aske</hi> it of him. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
               <p>And if we consider, we shall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily finde, that nothing in the world can make men wise, without the speciall teaching and grace of God. <note place="margin">Not nature.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Nature teacheth it not. Never did naturall man attaine this skill,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43759:96"/>
to benefit himselfe by his owne or others frailty. The voice of nature rather is, <hi>Let us eate and drinke, for</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 22. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>to morrow we shall die.</hi> And that speech of David in temptation is the speech of nature, <hi>In my prosperity I said, I</hi>

                  <hi>shall never be mooved,</hi> though it see taller and stronger oakes shaken, and overturned every day. Or how comes it to passe, that children seeing their Fathers mortality, can yet live in their Fathers sinnes? Who is it, that hath not something to shew of his deceased Parents? either lands, or houses, or jewels, or garments, or some other remembrance: by which he might be put in minde of their and his mortality: And yet how few make this use of it for reformation of their lives, or bestirre themselves to lay hold on this point of wisdome for their spirituall advantage? And all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, as nature cannot reach it, so they goe not to the Sanctuary of God, where onely this skill is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained?</p>
               <p>Neither doth the sence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience <note place="margin">Not sence.</note> of a mans owne or others

mortality teach a man thus to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his dayes, if the Lord instruct him not. For in <hi>Moses</hi> time the plague had oft broken out against the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and licked them up by thousands and ten thousands: yet could not all this get within their hearts, unlesse the Lord pleased to carry it deeper then the sense and impression could.</p>
               <p>For if the <hi>Word</hi> without the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit cannot prevaile, nor open the eare, much lesse can the <hi>Workes</hi> of God. And all see, that if the Ministery bee not a Ministery <hi>of the Spirit,</hi> it is not <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 6.</note> saving, but a dead letter.</p>
               <p>As for experience, that may teach the shortnesse and uncertainty of life, and make a man say as <hi>David, I am</hi>

                  <hi>a stranger here, as all my fathers were:</hi> and every man seeth numbers of his neighbours, friends, kindred, and acquaintance, laid up daily in the house of death: and this which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth into their senses, can draw out thus much, that we shall all dye, and death is most certaine. But where is this skill of numbring, urging men
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:43759:97"/>
by burials and executions to reforme their own lives? where is the living man, that layeth this to heart? that hence laboureth to make God his portion, before himselfe <hi>have no more portion</hi> of all things done under the <note place="margin">Eccles 9. 6.</note> Sun? or that stirreth up himself to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his Creator in the dayes of his youth,</hi> before his sun be darke, and his <note place="margin">12. 1.</note> pitcher be broken at the Well: What is the reason, but because Gods Grace and teaching goeth not with sense and experience? he hath spoken to the eyes and eares, but not to the heart: and nothing that a man seeth or heareth, or that is before him, can make him wiser, unlesse God nurture him, and teach him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite thereby.</p>
               <p>All which must draw us before God daily with that petition of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> in our mouthes, <hi>Lord teach us so to number our dayes, that wemay ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our hearts unto wisedome, Psal.</hi> 90. 12.</p>

               <p>TIme being short and precious, it were good to make account of <note place="margin">1 Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> it, for which account must be made unto God: and ever hold it in thy hand, or let it goe, for something better then it selfe; as wise Chapmen part with their mony.</p>
               <p>Or if thou hast lost any time, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme</hi>

Exchange those lusts, by which thou hast lost thy time, with better courses: Christ mourned, that Ierusalem had lost her day, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 42. and how should we bewaile the losse of many dayes?</p>
               <p>Be more carefull of time for the future, and waste not prodigally so <note place="margin">3</note> precious a commodity. Consider and meditate. <note place="margin">1 Motives to be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of time.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, what reason to be niggardly of wealth, and prodigall of time,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43759:98"/>
whereas all the wealth in the world cannot purchase one day to live lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?</p>
               <p>Secondly, why wilt thou not know <note place="margin">2</note> the <hi>worth</hi> of time before the <hi>want</hi> of time, as the most doe, who let it run irrecoverably from between their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and never know what they lose, till it be too late?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, why shouldest thou not spare before the bottome, before the <note place="margin">3</note> vessell be drawne out, whereas thou canst as easily draw backe the sunne in his course, as call backe an houre of time when it is past?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, were it not more wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <note place="margin">4</note> to set an high price on time in earth, then in hell? Where (as Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard saith) time were a good commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and the trafficke of time most gainefull: where for one day a man would give ten thousand worlds if he had them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, why do we complain of the <note place="margin">5 V. Stob. c. 98.</note> shortnesse of our lives, and not of the losse of time, seeing there is none but hath more time then he useth well?</p>
               <p>Sixtly, why do we put any time <note place="margin">6</note>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:43759:99"/>
into the account of our lives, but that <note place="margin">Simonides. Diu fuit, non din vixit Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascen.</note> which we carefully passe, and well, spend? seeing the heathen could say, He <hi>was</hi> long, he did not live long: and one <hi>Barlaam</hi> being asked of <hi>Iosaphat</hi> how old he was, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Five and forty yeeres old;</hi> to whom <hi>Iosaphat</hi> replyed, thou seemest to be <hi>seventy:</hi> true (quoth he) if you reckon ever since I was <hi>borne:</hi> but I count not those, which were <hi>spent in vanity.</hi> If wee should thus reckon the lives of some old men, we might esteeme men of seventy yeeres scarce ten dayes old.</p>
               <p>Lastly, consider how God in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice sometime cuts off those, who <note place="margin">7</note> make no reckoning, nor set price on their time, as they ought: <hi>Iob</hi> 15. 32. the wicked shall die before he hath accomplished his dayes, and his hand shall be <hi>cut off as the Uine in the bud,</hi> that is, young and tender.</p>
               <p>All which, together with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousnesse of time, should make us carefull, and to doe for time as we doe <note place="margin">Prevent theeves that steale away time.</note> for things of price; even beware of theeves who would steale it away, as namely.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:43759:99"/>
First, worldly cares and covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <note place="margin">1</note> whereby the minde is surchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and sunke in the gulfe of earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and whereby men live as if time were made for nothing but the getting of wealth, and laying up treasure in Chests, and no time to lay up treasure in heaven, as our, Saviour commandeth. Oh what a pilfering theefe is worldlinesse, which engros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth all the time! The Oxen, the Farme, the Wife, the like vanities take up the whole man, while the supper of the great King is despised. The thorny ground choakes all seed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Pleasures and Pastimes, <note place="margin">2</note> which waste and drive away time, even that precious time which can never be won againe. A wofull thing, that men should devise and doat on Pastimes, seeing the Scripture speaks of no pastime, but onely of passing our time <hi>in feare,</hi> and onely time well <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 17.</note> past is good pastime. A wofull thing, that professed Christians should dare to spend halfe dayes, whole daies, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes together, yea, the dayes of Gods solemne worship, in vain sports
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43759:100"/>
and pleasures, which rob them of their heart, wit, time, and grace, that they can scarce willingly afford themselves an houre in a wèeke to do their soules good in. A fearefull snare of Satan there is in it, and a sorcery in gaining, that holds a man a willing prisoner to his lusts so many houres together, that he would thinke himselfe in wofull bondage to be held the hundreth part of the time in any good duty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Eating, drinking, and feasting. This eates up much of our <note place="margin">3</note> time, and makes leane and starven soules. For, while men drinke in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, how is wisdome banished out of the soule? how is the time insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly stollen away? besides that these cast a man into excessive sleeping, by day as well as by night, wherin he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his time as in a shadow of death.</p>
               <p>These, and many other pilferers of time must a good husband of time watch against: as idlenesse, roving thoughts, bad companionship, distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and unprofitable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>First, unto youth. Young men and maydens, who thinke it a fine life to looke upon their rising sunne, must consider what price they set on their dayes. Why doest thou that art young, account thy life more precious then an old mans? is it because thou art in thy strength and vigour, which in him is past? If these were the price, the life of a brute beast should be more precious, then of any man: for the beast hath more sensible and violent pleasures then he, and is lesse restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them. But the price in truth stands in this, that now thou hast good wit, fresh senses, and all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of nature quick, to be the servants of grace, and means to enrich thee in godlinesse; wherein thou art before the aged, if thou knowest thy season.

                  </gap> mine owne lusts which fight against my soule? Whether hath grace seasoned my young yeares, that if I should be taken away young, I should be fit for God? Whether have I sowed to the flesh, or to the spirit? If to the flesh, I must looke to reape destruction: for, as a man soweth, so must he reape. And why doth God continue my youth, and give me all the powers and quicknesse of nature, and strength, and beauty? What, to fight for sinne? was this the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant I entred into in Baptisme? and when I have done, will it be a good answer to say, I did but as other youth did?</p>
               <p>How stands the case with me? doe not I see my mortality in many of mine owne degree? young men and maides cut off in their vigour and beauty? see I not youth to be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine as age? yea, the flower of youth to be but as the flower of the field? How had the case stood with me, if God had summoned me, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43759:101"/>
cut me off, when he cut off such and such of my yeares and acquaintance? Oh therfore I will now remember my Creator in the dayes of my youth, and grow to this point of wisedome, while I have meanes to be the better for them.</p>
               <p>Say not, I am young, and God lookes not for much at my hands: for God accepts no mans person, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause old or young, but according to the knowledge, faith, vertue, subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and grace, he accepts both young and old: which how little it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in our youth, is too plain and wofull.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to those of more yeeres, <note place="margin">2 To the aged.</note> whom young ones looke on for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, as such as should be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in the word of life, and should have more experience, as they have had more warning then the other. It behooves them to consider, how they have prized and husbanded their time. Let me aske an ancient man or woman: Why hath God given thee more yeares then those that are younger? is it not, that thou should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43759:102"/>
exceed them as farre in piety and grace, as thou doest in yeares? and also in means? and to be an ensample to them, in making a good account of both?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> puts the Colossians in minde, <note place="margin">Col. 1. 21.</note> what they <hi>were in times past:</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> to bring the Iewes to shame <note place="margin">Pet. 4. 3.</note> for that they had formerly done, tells them, that it was <hi>sufficient they had spent the time past in the lusts of the Gentiles, walking in wantonnesse, lusts, drunkennesse, gluttony, revellings, and abominable idolatries.</hi> So every man of yeares should recount his time past: What, have I lived thus long, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ainly, sinfully, and earthly? Have I all this time little thought of Gods wayes, of treasuring in heaven, of my latter end, and of my reckoning? Oh therefore, so much time as remains in the flesh, I will have care to spend according to the will of God.</p>
               <p>To this end, consider to whom <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> wrote: to new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, who had lately heard of God and his Gospell. But thou hast had daily meanes, wast bred up
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:43759:102"/>
in them, wast in the cradle entred into the Covenant, and daily mustred and reckoned amongst Gods servants: In all these yeares thou hast had a great many talents and receipts, many bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed opportunities, and it wilbe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected thou shouldest be so farre from living in lusts, as to bring in a good returne of knowledge, vertue, and grace. It is not now <hi>sufficient</hi> to thee, but too too much, a great shame for thee, to be so long, and under such meanes, and yet neglect only the one thing necessary. Yet how many, after so many yeares, can scarce thinke of any one thing backwards, soundly to comfort them, but all things may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cause them to hang downe their heads? How many riots, surfets, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders in their lives? Night and day too little to spend in the effusion of their lusts: What escapes them una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused to Gods dishonor, their owne harme, and spoile of the creature? What waste of time, thoughts, and means, in pride, gaming, and the like? Can there be more horrible drunkards and adulterers among Turks and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells, then among us?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:43759:103"/>
Let the conclusion then be, that though by examination in many yeeres thou findest many errors, and much time lost, yet bewaile what is past, as sufficient, and too much, and be carefull for time to come: The one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to have thy sinnes blotted out, and be able to hold up thy head in the day of reckoning.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To those that (beside <note place="margin">3. To the rich.</note> their yeares) are great and rich, They are double bound to this duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have double means &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. For being freed from such cares &amp; distractions, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> poore men are folded in, it is not that they may be the freer to wallow in their lusts, but that they may intend so much the more to piety and the making up of their account. A poore man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not heare, read, conferre so much: he hath not so many spare-houres in a day, but must labour perhaps his twelve houres, whereas the rich hath five, or sixe, or more, and some are freed most of the day: such therefore must thinke to give up their account after sixe or seven or twelve houres
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43759:103"/>
release, to heare, read, conferre, and pray proportionably, and so have sixe or seven, or twelve times so much grace, as they have so much more time and opportunity. And oh that you could bring in such a reckoning, as more houres, more grace!</p>
               <p>Another helpe that rich men have, is the having portion and meanes to helpe themselves into <hi>heavenly habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 16. 9.</note> and therefore to make a good account, they must see they be not onely not worse for their wealth, as the most are, but better. Let them see how they have strengthened their lusts by riches, sweld in pride, bathed themselves in pleasure: whereas they ought to bring in their reckoning, how they have inquired into the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the poore, to clothe, harbour and feed them, that themselves may be clothed and harbored in heaven: and how they have done good, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abounded in good workes to the stributed, yea, praise of God. This is another care, then to devise how to spend them upon lusts, and by them shut heaven upon themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:43759:104"/>
Fourthly, For the poore: howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">4. To the poore.</note> the Lord hath dealt unto them a weake estate, and they may thinke themselves hardly used, as wanting, meanes to make up their reckoning yet are they not exempted from the practise of this point of wisedome: And for their encouragement let them know, that though they want those houres, and that wealth which the rich have, yet may they bring in as good a reckoning as the best: Be thou never so poore, thou hast the Word of God, and all the publike meanes; thou hast also some private meanes, thy family-exercises: and hence thou mayest treasure knowledge, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish good conscience: the case being with thee, as those that gathered Manna, every man even to the poorest gathered for his necessity, <note place="margin">Exod. 16. 18.</note> and whosoever gathered, had no want. Neither can poverty prejudice salvation, so much as wealth: for, to whom is the arme of the Lord revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and who receive the Gospell, but poore weake ones?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But I can give nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:43759:104"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, as much as the rich. Hast thou a desire? canst thou pray? hast thou bowels of love in thee, and compassion in thy heart? hast thou commended his comfort unto God, whom thou wouldest, but canst not comfort? Even this shall stand on thine head as a sufficient reliefe, and be returned abundantly. The poore Widow cast in a mite or two, and it was more then all the superfluity of the rich: the least gift was the best, because it had the best affection; and let the rich want this, their work hath no reward. In one word, let riches, and poverty meet with like affection, the latter gets as farre into heaven as the former.</p>

                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:43759:105"/>
Thirdly, consider the benefit. How <note place="margin">3</note> rich might the soule be by time well watehed and spent, and by awaking the heart continually to take hold of God? how plentifull in good works? how many fervent prayers might bee stored up in heaven, if men would stirre up their desires hereto? how ready might they bee to give up a cheerefull and comfortable reckoning, and receive a large retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, consider thou carriest <note place="margin">4 Vnius cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tè diei in dolentia magnum lucrum est.</note> mortality in thy nature ever about thee, as <hi>Uriah</hi> in <hi>Davids</hi> letters. Thou hast no priviledge above other, no lease of thy life, death not bound to give thee warning: and therefore while it is day, doe thy worke, and doe it to the uttermost: while the day of Gods grace and thy life lasteth, walke and worke. Now is the Sun-shine of the Gospell: <hi>to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 95. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>day</hi> heare his voyce. Thy Sunne also yet lasteth, while thou hast life, health, youth, memory, and strength of body, treasure up instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and comforts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:43759:106"/>
Earthly men care for age, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall contentments: but doe thou get a better stocke to spend upon, which will never faile thee: then shall the latter dayes, and dayes of sicknesse be passed with more content and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse: and an happy death must needs succeed a godly and carefull course of life.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, consider how much of thy life thou hast wasted out already, and <note place="margin">5</note> that the patience of God still spareth thee to recover what thou hast lost. Think it now too much, that thouhast spent so much time in the lusts of the Gentiles, and now enjoyne thy selfe a constant taske of prayer, reading, meditating, reckoning: and doe it to purpose, not by halves, not for forme: for then thy other practises will bee answerable. And for time to come labour to set before thee in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of time an image of eternity; this life being but as a <hi>moment, on which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note>

                  <hi>Sixtly</hi> great is the danger of omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">6</note> and slipping this season. How can they be acceptable to God, who

refuse his <hi>acceptable time?</hi> Is not his <note place="margin">Esa. 49. 8.</note> Axe laid to the root of the Tree, to hew it downe, if it be still unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? And doth not the Master of the evill servant come in an houre, which he knoweth not?</p>
               <p>Oh thinke often of the reckoning and account of your time, and thus resolve: Oh how farre am I behinde with God for my time! such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift I have beene of it, as I cannot give account of one day among a thousand: Now therefore while I have time, I will live every day as if it were my last day, and doe that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day which I would have found in my hands on my dying day.

            <epigraph>

               <q>No man that warreth, entangleth himselfe with the affaires of this life, because he would please him who hath chosen him to be a souldier.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He parts of the Chapter are two: one hortatory, to the 16 verse: The other dehortatory, thence to the end.</p>
            <p>In the third verse the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth <note place="margin">Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
               <hi>Timothy</hi> to suffer affliction;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:43759:108"/>
and addeth a reason drawne from his calling, because he was a <hi>Souldier,</hi> a place of paines, of perill, and molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Vpon which occasion he makes a description of a souldier by two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties in the verse read unto you including two duties more, which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly he commendeth to <hi>Timothies</hi> practise, and in him to every faithfull Minister: 1 Not to entangle himselfe with secular affaires: 2 To please his Captaine.</p>
            <p>But what have we to do with war? we are men of Peace, Ministers of the <note place="margin">Object.</note> Gospell of peace, and expected not this day an Herald of Armes, or a Trumpet to call us into the field: and doth not your Text forbid us to be <hi>entangled</hi> with such secular affaires?</p>
            <p>First, Comparisons serve for illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The use of compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> and conviction. For the first: high points are made plaine by them: for we cannot see the Sun in his own body, in water we may: and therfore it is, that Christ makes us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand our spirituall union, by the Vine &amp; branches. For the second: high <note place="margin">2</note>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:43759:108"/>
spirits are plained and checked by them: and therefore Christ, when he saw that neither <hi>Iohns</hi> austerity, nor his owne lenity would a whit move the Iewes to amendment, especially the Scribes and Pharisees, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them to little froward and sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len children, whom neither piping nor mourning could prevaile withall, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 17.</p>
            <p>This serves notably for both: and it is an argument <hi>à minori ad majus,</hi> If earthly souldiers doe thus, a shame for spirituall not to lay aside distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and seeke to please their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, our Warre is a most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <note place="margin">2 2 Tim. 2. 3</note> Warre: <hi>We warre not after the flesh, 2 Cor.</hi> 10. 3. We are souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as may be seene in the former verse. We are not pressed into the field by a temporall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, nor stand in the face of bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemies, nor arme our selves with <hi>carnall</hi> weapons, <hi>verse</hi> 4. But wee fight the Lords battels, stand under CHRISTS Colours, contend against spirituall wickednesses,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43759:109"/>
covered with Gods armor of proofe, and having our Captaine in the field before us for encouragement, and with us for victory. Why should we be heavy to be led out after him? Good <hi>Vriah</hi> would not goe home to his house, because his Lord <hi>Ioab</hi> did lie in the field: and if our Lord Iesus be in the field, what should wee doe at home?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Peace is <hi>dulce nomen,</hi> but <note place="margin">3</note> especially that peace with God, and men, and our own consciences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are Preachers. But as peace is procured by warre, and the end of warre is peace, so we can never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure or preserve this peace, unlesse by warre we keepe under the enemies of peace: so that preaching of warre I ayme at peace, and to heare of a rumour of warre, which hath no other hurt then to establish our peace, is profitable.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, a good and teachable heart will learne something from <note place="margin">4</note> every thing. Christ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earthly things taught heavenly: and not any thing but it ministred him matter of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:43759:109"/>
the sun, bread, water, other. And so must we, as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this day of Visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on consider the day of Gods Visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein we shalbe countable of that we heare, or speake, or doe this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No man that warreth entangleth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">What this entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not.</note> 
               <hi>himselfe.</hi> Souldiers must be free from distraction. Not according to the glossses of Papists, who say,</p>
            <p>First, tstat Ministers must be free <note place="margin">1</note> from marriage. If marriage be a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction or defilement, as they say it is, then is it not a Sacrament. Besides, the Prophets, Aposties, Bishops, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, in and after the Apostles time: were married.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That they must bee Monkes, and live a part, shut up from <note place="margin">2</note> the world. But how then shall they <hi>bee examples to the flocke? 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that they must be voluntary beggars, which is a state of perfection, and freedome from encombrance. But <note place="margin">3</note> with greater encumbrances, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles had famililies, and Bishops must be such as can <hi>rule their owne fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> wives, and children: and in old Canons the proper goods of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:43759:110"/>
must be distinct from the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches goods.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it is not meant, that hee must not have any knowledge in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <note place="margin">4.</note> affaires: for then how shall hee resolve Cases of Conscience, and compound Controversies, which are <hi>Appendices</hi> of his calling?</p>
            <p>But this is the meaning: He must <note place="margin">What it is.</note> absteine from such things as hinder his Calling, the course of his publike Ministery, for these causes:</p>
            <p>First, because of the greatnesse of his function, whence S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Who is sufficient for these things?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 16</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Because of his owne weaknesse: being an <hi>earthen vessell,</hi> though filled, with heavenly treasure. <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Because of the contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Word and the world: no man can <hi>serve these two Masters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of the Title or Appellation of <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 24.</note> a Minister we may learne that,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Every faithfull Minister is a souldier, warring under Iesus Christ;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> Good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are Christs souldiers.</note> 
               <hi>not onely as he is a Christian, but also as he is a Minister.</hi> As a Christian, hee begins his strife in Baptisme,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:43759:110"/>
and ends with life. As a Minister, it begins so soone as ever he sets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe faithfully to discharge his dutie. <note place="margin">In two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</note> Christ no sooner inaugurated, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins combat with the devil. As a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, the place of battell is the world: as a Minister, the place is his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall standing &amp; office in the Church. As a Christian, his chiefe strife is <hi>with himselfe,</hi> his reason with his reason, his will with his will, and every part with other: as a Minister, his greatest strife is <hi>without him,</hi> fighting with the corrupt reason and wils of the wicked angels and men.</p>
            <p>The Apostle especially aymeth at this latter, and so must we. A mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster by vertue of his spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iall calling is a <hi>souldier</hi> of God; and, not a common one, but a leader.</p>
            <p>First, His Ministery is a warfare: <note place="margin">The war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare it selfe</note> a speciall calling set apart to batter the walls of the Devils kingdome, and maintain Christ in the right of his kingdome: so that every good Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster must imitate <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, hold the sword in one hand, and the trowel in the other; fight with one hand, and build with the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:43759:111"/>
Secondly, his weapons are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall <note place="margin">Weapons.</note> gifts, of sanctification, and of his function; the use of which is, to stablish truth, and convince error. His contention stands not in the exercise of the strength of the body, but of the graces of the minde, faith, prayers, and teares. Nor his victory in shewing greatnesse and headinesse of Spirit, but in modesty, charity, humility, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and suffering. Christian forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is <hi>in ferendo, non in feriendo:</hi> not in smiting, but suffering.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, his enemies are, <hi>Satan himselfe who</hi> stands at his right hand <note place="margin">Enemies. Zech. 3. 1.</note> to hinder him, as Iehoshua in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery; and all the <hi>bands of Satan,</hi> or troups in which his chief power consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth, as idolatry, empiety sin, error, the stubbornnes and pride of mans heart, which ever resisteth the truth of God; and <hi>all such persons</hi> as are more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall agents and negotiators for Satan, as first, Heretickes, who are souldiers, but the divels Champions, and under <note place="margin">1</note> his pay. Among them all, that which we must most oppose, is the heresie of Popery, which hath many great and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:43759:111"/>
resolute Defenders; who are souldiers too, but not of Iesus Christ, but of Antichrist, his arch enemie: and yet, because Popery should be manifest to be the <hi>mystery of iniquity,</hi> under the colours of Christ it fighteth against <note place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 7.</note> Christ. Secondly, openly wicked and <note place="margin">2</note> profane persons, who under a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Christianity sticke not to live as heathens, following the fashions of the world, and trading in the lusts of their owne hearts. Thirdly, secretly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicked men and hypocrites, who in <note place="margin">3</note> shew professe Christianity also, but in heart cleave to the world, and their owne lusts, as Iudas did. Fourthly, Apostates and revolters, traytors unto <note place="margin">4</note> Christ, who after they have taken his pressemony and good wages, turne into the enemies campe. Fifthly schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes <note place="margin">5</note> and Separatists, who are not able to distinguish betweene the City and the wall, the body and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, the face and the spot, <hi>id est.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene substance and ceremonie, and with as great heat fight against our Church, as against a Synagogue of Antichrist.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:43759:112"/>
Against all these, as every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian else, so especially the Minister must <hi>contend for the faith, which was once given to the Saints, Iude</hi> 3. But one rule must be observed in all these, We must intend <hi>paecem cum hominibus, cum vitijs bellum:</hi> peace with the men, warre with the vices.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they never want the just and lawfull causes of a necessary <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Causes of warre.</hi> Bellum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i paci praefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendum est. <hi>Demosth.</hi> 1 2</note> warre: as First, to suppresse spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall enmities, as the Iudges did the heathens. Secondly, to deliver the oppressed: such as are <hi>taken captives</hi> of Satan and sinne, and laden with the bolts of lusts, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. So <hi>Abraham</hi> rescued <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> his two wives. Thirdly, to recover things wrongfully taken: Gods <note place="margin">3</note> image, holinesse, righteousnesse, grace, and the Kingdome of glory. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, warre is <hi>publica quaedam vindicta:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">4</note> so Israel revenged the wrong done to the <hi>Levites</hi> wife. Fiftly, breaking of leagues is a just cause of warre: <note place="margin">5</note> as 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24. 1, 2. when <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> rebelled against <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> God sent against him the <hi>Chaldees,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:43759:112"/>
Syrians, Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Ammonites.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> served <hi>Hanun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if the Ministery be a warfare, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Use. 1. Ad agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum nati milites. Cicero.</hi> Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. 1. Israel go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Egypt had no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: but into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, never free.</note> certainely it is no calling of ease; but he that is to enter into this calling, must looke for labour, paines, perill, disgrace, persecution, and, as a good souldier of Iesus Christ, suffer afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Never was there a more difficult and doubtfull warre undertaken.</p>
            <p>First, in respect of the adversaries, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan &amp; all wicked men, who continually bend their forces against a godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister. Christ was no sooner baptized, but tempted: nor <hi>Paul</hi> sooner conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but persecution arose. They are <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes iurati,</hi> the unholy, and yet that that calleth it self the <hi>holy league.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, In respect of the invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible <note place="margin">2</note> holds they are to assault; even the kingdome and throne of Satan, which he hath been fortifying almost 6000. yeares, and hath so entrenched him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the world, as onely the power of God is able to cast downe his tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Besides, what paines is required to subdue the stubborne heart of man, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> standeth diametrally opposite to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:43759:113"/>
the Gospel, and will not easily yeeld up it selfe? With what sweat and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour are those <hi>high thoughts,</hi> that are <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 5</note> erected against god, brought under?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In respect of the aydes <note place="margin">3</note> and fortifications, which the adverse party daily receiveth from Allyes and Confederates. The world (the devils faithfull Armour-bearer) sets upon a Minister on the right hand, with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements, preferments, and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, and ministereth a thousand occasions to call him from his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that the devill may make ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocke of the flocke: On the left hand it besets him with persecutions (if the former succeed not) as <hi>Iosephs</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse first used faire entising speaches, and, these not prevayling, fell foule with him presently.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in respect of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters <note place="margin">4</note> function and standing. He is a leader in the foreward, and forlorne hopes, that must stand the first encounter with fresh, fierce, and furious enemies. The chiefe ayme of an Army is against the standard-bearer: and <hi>David</hi> knew what it
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43759:113"/>
was to set <hi>Vriah</hi> in the first ranke.</p>
            <p>No marvell then, if the Apostle would first of all arme <hi>Timothy</hi> against afflictions. What doe we souldiers dreame of ease and delicacy? What stand we upon sweat and paines, who are called to hazzard our blood? What, will we part with blood, and not with sweat? He mistakes his <note place="margin">Cowards delight more in plumes of feathers, then marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all armes 01 service.</note> marke, who thinkes the Ministery on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a matter of maintenance and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And people also, that thinke it an easie life to be a good Minister. A souldier must stand in continuall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his life, yea to the losse of his life: as <hi>Paul,</hi> whose life was <hi>not deare</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 20. 24.</note> to him, that he might fulfill his course with joy. Looke for rest and ease, when the field is won. In the meane time, the souldier of Christ must <hi>doe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Militi mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta agenda, patienda plura.</note> 
               <hi>many things, and suffer more.</hi> And as the markes of blowes and wounds are truest notes of a souldier, so are the markes of Christ, of a good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.</p>
            <p>Againe, if Ministers be souldiers, <note place="margin">Use 2.</note> let them (with other parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:43759:114"/>
Armour) put on these Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall <note place="margin">Ministerial weapons to be put on. 1 Courage.</note> weapons.</p>
            <p>First, courage and resolution. For, <hi>strength</hi> is for the warre: namely, of the minde. They must not be timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and fearefull, as most of Gedeons souldiers (a nation whereof would do no good in this war) but couragious, like leaders and Captaines. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is, <hi>Tutiores cervi duce leone, quam leones duce cervo:</hi> It is more likely, that Harts will get victory, with a lion to their leader, then lions with a leading Hart. <hi>Ioshua</hi> a Captaine of the Lords battels must <hi>be of good courage, cha.</hi> 1. 7. So must Ministers be bold and confident in every good cause. And as a souldier goes out with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile minde against his enemies: so must we against sins and vices. <hi>Num. 25. 17. vexe the Midianites, and smite them,</hi> let them know you are enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they evill intreated you. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! the Midianites know not many Ministers to be their enemies, they are so cowardly and faint-hearted.</p>
            <p>This valour and prowesse will keepe a Minister from recoyling and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:43759:114"/>
retyring, and make him say with <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Neh. 6 11.</note> 
               <hi>Should such a man as I flee?</hi> should I be weake as another man? no, I will dye rather. <hi>Pulchrior in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio occisus miles, quam fugâ salvus.</hi> Better be slaine in the bed of honour, then be safe by running away.</p>
            <p>Secondly, wisdome and counsell. <note place="margin">2 Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell. <gap reason="foreign">

Counsel with God: 1. With the word, that teacheth thy fingers to fight. 2. By prayer: as 1 <hi>Sam. 17. 45. David</hi> went against the <note place="margin">

               </note> Philistine <hi>in the name of the Lord.</hi> Fight with sword &amp; shield, word and prayer. Some wish <hi>a praying</hi> Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not <hi>preaching. Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> sheweth, how the heathens <hi>commended</hi> the prayers of a captain that prayed for victory, with his sword in his hand, and fighting called for ayde; and <hi>condemned</hi> them that withdrew from the battell, under colour of praying for good successe: because the gods accept not the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:43759:115"/>
prayers of Cowards; and because they were unreasonable prayers. Vnreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able they thought it, that he who shoots not, should hit the marke, or that he should winne victory, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides not the battell. Thirdly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult with expert souldiers, by diligent reading the Scriptures, Expositors, Fathers, Controversies: these will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct a man, which weapon to use, how and when, and agreeing with Scripture are like the sling and stone, by which <hi>David</hi> overcame <hi>Goliah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, sobriety. What good use <note place="margin">3 Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.</note> in warre can be made of a drunken and intemperate souldier? he runnes into the field without his weapons, or rather not able to beare up himselfe, much lesse to overthrow his enemie. If he strike, he is as ready to strike and wound his next fellow, as any enemy. How great reason had the Apostle to charge <hi>Titus,</hi> that Ministers should <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 7, 8.</note> be <hi>temperate, sober, no drinkers,</hi> that is, affectedly and excessively, either of wine or tobacco?</p>
            <p>And one branch of sobriety is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation</hi> with a mans estate: not
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:43759:115"/>
to be covetous, but take up the lesson of Iohn Baptist (to the souldiers that asked him, what they should do) <hi>Luk. 3. be content with your wages.</hi> A litle will serve a souldier, much is a burden. Roman Captaines were poote themselves, and enriched their soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: insomuch as Publicola, Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, and Menenius Agrippa (great souldiers) kept not so much as to discharge their funeralls. They would enrich the State, not themselves. So we the Church.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, conscience, and religious <note place="margin">4 Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> affections: <hi>Deu. 23. 9. when thou goest out against thine enemies, keepe thee from all wickednesse: for the Lord walketh in the midst of the Campe.</hi> These souldiers must not only have <hi>morall</hi> vertues, as <hi>Cesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> who were rarely gifted, but <hi>Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> godlinesse and holinesse; on these stands the prosperity of this warre: <hi>Deu.</hi> 28. 3. He that hath so many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies incamping against him, had not need make God his enemy too: nor be his owne enemy, as Bellonaes Priests who used to lance and cut
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:43759:116"/>
themselves like the Baalites. A soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier <note place="margin">Tertul. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologet. cap. 9.</note> standing in the face of his enemie must never be in such an estate, as wherein he dares not dye: no more must a Minister. And besides, a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Minister weakeneth the whole army, as <hi>Achan</hi> did the Israelites.</p>
            <p>Of such souldiers, thus qualified, we may justly say, <hi>One shall chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, Deu.</hi> 32. 30. Because they go in the armour, strength, cause, and name of God; they shall surely prevaile.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if Ministers be souldiers, serving in the warres of Christ, then <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Use</hi> 3. All must joyne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </note> must they learne to unite their forces against the common enemy. Vnited forces prevaile much. It is a Maxime in policy to sow seeds of discord, and cast bones of dissention amongst ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: for a Kingdome divided against it selfe cannot stand: discord in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty makes of one City two: and the same doth mutiny among souldiers, <hi>it makes of one Army two.</hi> Faction among souldiers was the overthrow of Ierusalem, which, while they agreed among themselves, was so invincible
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:43759:116"/>
and impregnable, as no man on earth <hi>would have thought,</hi> that ever the enemy should have set foot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the gates of Ierusalem, as <hi>Lam.</hi> 4. 12. but when the fire of mutiny and faction was kindled in <hi>Sion,</hi> that one slew another, and burnt the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries and storehouses, then were the foundations of it devoured; that <hi>Titus</hi> himselfe, viewing the City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonne, cryed out, <hi>We have had</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>God to fight with us, and if God had not fought against them, they had never been foyled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The light of nature could say, that the thickest wall of a City in peace, and the safest rampart in warre, is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>Would to God we that are led by the life of grace, would all labour to reare up and thicken this wall of the Church, the City of God. We cannot be all one <hi>in iudgement,</hi> having divers gifts both for kinde and measure: but we may be one <hi>in affection,</hi> and must. We cannot all thinke one thing: but we must all embrace charity.</p>
            <p>Would God that wholesome law,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:43759:117"/>
called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>immemory</hi> were <note place="margin">Justin Hist. 5.</note> brought in, that all former heats and injuries were forgotten, and buryed and rotten in the dust of Oblivion. Let the Midianites thrust every man his sword into his fellowes side: but let our swords, and pennes, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and arguments be sharpned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Popish Midianites.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if Ministers be souldiers, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 4. Honor due o Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, hreefold.</note> then people owe unto them <hi>double,</hi> yea treble honour. First, of reverence and respect. Commanders in the field are in places of honor. <hi>Elias</hi> was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured as the horsemen of Israel and the chariots thereof. It is a signe of secure times, when souldiers arenot set by. How necessary a Captaine is in time of warre, a Physician in time of sicknesse, a reaper in time of harvest; so necessary is the Minister. Secondly, of prayer for their forces: while <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> held up his hands Israel prevailed. Thirdly, of maintenance: that they be not entangled with worldly affaires: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2, no man goeth to warre, <hi>of his owne cost.</hi> A labourer deserveth wages, and the souldier his pay. And
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:43759:117"/>
seeing Tythes are appointed by law, as the most equall pay, the Law of God is, that the labourers hire stay not in thy hands all night. And the people shall finde the fruit, when without distraction the Minister doth apply himselfe unto them. But now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adayes, many that tend the flockes, scarce taste of the milke. And pity it is on the other side, if people justly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of their Minister, saying, Oh he is an hard man, he reapes where he sowes not, and gathers where he scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not; he takes pay, but serves not in the field; feeds not the flock, but feeds upon it; preyes upon it, seldome prayes with it.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, if Ministers be souldiers, we <note place="margin">Use. 5. In re mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam anar chia colera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Plato de leg. 12.</note> must learne to keepe our rankes, and not runne out of our owne aray and standing. The campe is the souldiers City: the safest, fittest, and most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable place for him: and an army out of order is as a body, whose mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are out of joynt, which can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther march nor fight. No captaine can in reason command one souldier to two services in severall places of the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:43759:118"/>
field at once, nor can one souldier serve in two fields at one time. God likewise is not so unreasonble. And it is a sin for <hi>Ionas,</hi> who should goe to Ninive, to flee to Tarshish.</p>
            <p>What have Priests to doe to bee Popes, heads of the Church, warriers, and welders of the two swords? Christ gave Peter a key, not a scepter. What have the Iesuites to do, to medle with all State-matters in Christendome, to dispose and transplant Kingdomes? which medling of theirs in other mens matters hath brought just hatred on them, to be cast out of many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Is Christs Commission changed? Absolving of men from sinnes, into absolving them from civill obedience? Are these Iesuiticall Synonimies? I will give thee the keyes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, and I will give thee the thrones and earthly Kingdomes, to set up and depose whom and when you please? Is it all one, to be a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher of men, and to fish for King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes?</p>
            <p>To come home to our selves: we
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:43759:118"/>
must heare alwaies, <hi>Propter quod ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, hoc age,</hi> Hold this plough. We are called out from home into the field, and set apart by God to call o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of the world. Why then should we be inordinate in our care for the world? Aboveall other men, our speciall calling must not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with inferior cares. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites were of Gods finding, to waite on the Altar. Why should we entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ourselves with other mens affaires, as <hi>Peter, Master what shall this man</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 21. 21.</note> 
               <hi>doe?</hi> Or with contentions and brab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in law, like common barreters? Why should any be a Minister of peace with <hi>Iacobs</hi> voice, and a man of warre, or a rough-handed hunter, as <hi>Esau</hi> was?</p>
            <p>What are you, our Governours Commissioners, but sent to see to the keeping of our rankes and order in this battell? An Order established by Gods word, and example. When the Church was but <hi>in herba,</hi> or in the seed, and grew crooked in Paradise, God was the first Visitor, who set it in order again by the promise. When
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:43759:119"/>
it was but in a family, the Patriarkes were Visitors. <hi>Iacob</hi> in his house which was then the Church, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them <hi>to put away</hi> their idolls, if they would feare the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 2. When it was in the Kingdome of the Iewes, the Prophets were Visitors: as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. the Prophet went farther. into the Temple, and still found more abominations. The son of God was the most honourable Visitor of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Temple, who made a whip, and cast out buyers and sellers. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles after him <hi>(Act.</hi> 15. 36.) were Visitors of the Church, and were glad to see their <hi>order, Coloss.</hi> 2. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: the word signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the Array of souldiers, well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed against the enemy: Vpon which words Chrysostome hath an <note place="margin">Chrysost in <hi>Col</hi> 2. 5.</note> excellent Glosse, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>All good Visitations ever tended to the purging of the Church from idolatry, urging of men to Gods house and service, the casting out of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:43759:119"/>
buyers and sellers, the driving out of insufficient men, and planting a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and able Ministery, the removing of scandalous and hurtfull men, as no Leper might come before the Lord, to stand before his Altar; the repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of strange and corrupt Doctrine, which as strange fire might not bee offered before the Lord; the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the diligent hand, and the censure of open sinners, that others may feare.</p>
            <p>These things set before you, and when the great Visitation-day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, wherein righteousnesse shall be remunerated, and iniquity be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to hide her head, if the hills would be perswaded to fall upon her, and hide her, you shall be remembred in goodnesse for all the goodnesse you have done to the house of God, and the Offices and Officers of it.</p>

            <head>Postscript.</head>
            <p>FIrst, souldiers must be called, &amp; do all by authority, warranting them to doe things which otherwise were unlawfull. To kill, sacke, and spoile, without calling, were murder, robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and oppression. Command is the key of warre, whrch else were a <hi>Chaos,</hi> or <hi>Akeldama,</hi> a confused field of blood. Apply it to the Ministery.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As Souldiers must bee trained, armed, united, honoured, and ordered, so must Ministers, spiritually; and all for the glory of Christ in the Church. Looke at him, who for our good despised ease, and for our exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple sent not his servants onely, but came himselfe in person: And a souldier being pressed must not send a Deputy, but serve in his own person. Or wilt thou be (as <hi>Arnobius) abs<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

            <p>Thirdly, As good Leaders, we must lead our people out of dangerous
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:43759:120"/>
wayes, and be sure all passages bee cleared; for that there are many times more dangers in odde meetings and skirmishes, then in open field.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We must not scorn plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, wherein our company may goe along with us: Not mount up aloft in high and Scholasticall speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as if we would lead men over the Alpes to heaven. Nor in rough and craggy wayes of knotty Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, or abstruse passages: But in a faire and beaten path, that with our selves our company may come safely and speedily to the end of our march and journey. And wisedome will teach people to live, not to <hi>dispute,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome them rather to fight with their <hi>owne vices,</hi> the other <hi>mens opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> The most profitable combat is that, which every man makes with with himselfe: And if with others, then, when not victory, but truth is sought: else both truth and charity are lost together.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Vse allowed weapons of <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Lastly, Take heed we let not <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad</hi> goe, <hi>id est,</hi> men committed to our trust and keeping; lest our lives goe for their lives.</p>
