         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOU canst not be such a Stranger to thy
own Countrey, as to need my commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Learned, Worthy and Famous
<hi>AUTHOR</hi> of these following Sheets; or
that I should tell thee, what a Scholar, a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lologer,
a Humanist, a Linguist, a Lawyer,
a Critick, an Antiquary, and (which proves him an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Master of all these and many other Knowledges) what
a Writer, the Great <hi>SELDEN</hi> was. Since it is liberally
acknowledged by every body, that knows any thing (not
only at home, but abroad also among Foreigners) that <hi>Europe</hi>
seldom hath brought forth <hi>His Fellow</hi> for exquisite Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Nature, Attainments of Study, and Accomplishments
of Ingenuity, Sagacity and Industry. And indeed, to save
me the labour of saying any more concerning this <hi>Non-pareil</hi> in
all kinds of Learning, His own <hi>WORKS,</hi> which are now
<pb facs="tcp:108530:4"/>
under a Review, and will e're long be made Publick in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Volumes, will sufficiently speak his Character, and be a
more prevailing Argument to indear Him to thy good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and firm Acquaintance, than mine or any other <hi>Words</hi>
can.</p>
            <p>My business now is only to give thee some Account of
the Author's design in this little <hi>Treatise,</hi> and of those mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
I took in Translating Him, that is, in restoring him to
his own Native Language; though his great <hi>Genius</hi> had made
the <hi>Latin</hi> and several other <hi>Tongues,</hi> as natural and familiar to
Himself, as the <hi>English</hi> was.</p>
            <p>To speak first of the <hi>Author,</hi> I do take this Piece to have been
one of his first Essays, if not the very first; wherein he launched
into the World, and did not so much try the Judgement, as
deservedly gain the Approbation of the Learned: which
was certainly one Reason, why, though the whole matter of
the Book be of an <hi>English</hi> Complexion and Concern, yet he
thought fit to put it forth in a <hi>Latin</hi> dress. That this was his
first <hi>Specimen,</hi> or at least one of the first, I gather from the time
of his Writing it, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Six and Twentieth year of his
Age; when I suppose he was not of any very long standing in
the <hi>Temple;</hi> I mean, in all likelihood, whilst he was on this
side the Bar. For having fraught himself with all kind of
Learning, which the <hi>University</hi> could afford him (which could
be, we must imagine, no small time neither; as I may be
allowed to guess from that passage of his in this Book, where
he so affectionately recognizeth his Duty and Gratitude to his
dear Mother <hi>OXFORD;</hi> who, if she had no other <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
to boast of, is and ever will be Famous for This Her Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
our great <hi>Antiquary;</hi> who hath also such a Monument to
be seen in her publick <hi>Library,</hi> as will make her Glory and his
Memory ever to flourish) I say, having after some compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
time taken leave of <hi>Academical</hi> Institutions, and being
now engaged into the Study of <hi>Law,</hi> he thought he could not
do his Profession a better service, than by looking back into
former times, and making a faithful Collection of what
might be Pertinent and Useful, to bring down, along through
all Changes and Vicissitudes of State, the Light and Strength,
the Evidence and Reputation of old Institutes and Precedents
to our present Establishments under our Gracious and Happy
Monarchy. May It, as it is in its Constitution to the <hi>English</hi>
people <hi>Gracious;</hi> so be ever in its Success to It self, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
<pb facs="tcp:108530:4"/>
to Us all, <hi>Happy!</hi> Here then thou wilt find the
Rights of Government through all Ages, so far as our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
will help us; Here thou wilt see, from the first, our
<hi>KING</hi> setled in his just Power, even in his <hi>Ecclesiastical su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction</hi>
against the <hi>Papal Usurpation;</hi> one shrewd Instance
whereof is, the forbidding Appeals to the <hi>Pope,</hi> at such a
time when the <hi>Popish Religion</hi> was at its Zenith in this Island;
that is, when People in all probability were most Ignorant.
Here thou wilt easily be brought to acknowledge the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Usefulness of <hi>Parliaments</hi> (though under other Names
till after the Conquest) when all the <hi>Barons,</hi> that is, as that
Title did at first import, all Lords of Mannors, all Men of
Estate assembled together for the determination of publick
Affairs: which Usage, because it produced too numerous and
cumbersome a confluence, was afterwards for better conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
retrenched into a popular Election by the Kings Writ
to chuse some of the Chiefest to act for all the rest. And
sure enough, if we in Duty keep up the <hi>Royal Prerogative,</hi>
and our Kings, as ever they have done, and ever, I hope, will,
in Grace and Clemency oblige the <hi>Peoples Consent</hi> in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives;
we shall alwayes have such Laws, such a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
such a Correspondence betwixt Prince and Subjects,
as must (according to the Rules of Humane Prudence, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
our Piety to it) make this Kingdom of Great <hi>Britanny</hi>
(maugre the malice of the Devil and his Agents whatever, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi>
or <hi>Fanaticks</hi>) a flourishing and impregnable Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Having said this in General of the Author's design, I shall
not descend to Particulars, which I leave to thy self, <hi>Reader,</hi>
to find out, in the perusal, that may be of good Use and
great Consequence to the Publick; but fearing, thou maist
think I am so much taken up with the <hi>Author,</hi> that I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
<hi>My self,</hi> I have two or three words to speak of that sorry
subject, before I leave thee.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Translator;</hi> I confess, it is no great credit for any one
to appear in that Figure; a Remark, which I have learn't from
one, who hath translated another excellent Piece of this <hi>Noble
Author, (Noble</hi> I call him, sith Nobility is rais'd by Parts and
Merits, no less than continued by Birth and Descent) it was
his <hi>Mare Clausum,</hi> wherein he, I spoke of, hath acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
very well, abating for his Villanous <hi>Dedication</hi> to the
<hi>RUMP-Parliament,</hi> which was then setting up for a <hi>Republick;</hi>
in which Dedication of his, he hath vilely and like himself (I
<pb facs="tcp:108530:5"/>
speak in Charity, as to his Interest, I mean, not his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Conscience at least, if there were any) aspersed the
<hi>Royal Family</hi> with Weakness and Collusion, to have lower'd
the <hi>British</hi> Renown.</p>
            <p>I am bid by Him, who puts this into thy hands, to tell
thee, that when he was embark'd into this Employ; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it was, upon the coasting of it over, he was surprized to
find, he had undertaken such a difficult and hazardous Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and did presently conclude, That none but a <hi>Selden</hi> (that
is, a Person of omnifarious Reading) was fit to be a <hi>Selden</hi>'s
Interpreter. For no other person, but one so qualified, can
be Master of his Sense, Master of his Expression. His ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Style, where he delivers himself plainest, is as to the
Matter of it, so full of Historical and Poetical Allusions, and
as to the Method (and hath that of Crabbed in it besides) so
Intricate and Perplex, that he seems, even where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to Teach and Instruct, to have intended only to Amuse
and Confound the Reader. In very deed, it is such a Style, as
became a Learned <hi>Antiquary,</hi> which is to be <hi>Antique</hi> and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
that one would think, the very Paper, he wrote upon,
was made of the <hi>Sibyll</hi>'s old-worn Sheets, and that his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
could not be fisht out without the assistance of a <hi>Delian</hi>
Diver. However the <hi>Translator</hi> (though so much Inferiour
to the Undertaking, as to be almost Unacquainted with some
considerable parts of it) did presume (whether rightly or
no, must be left to thy judgement) that he was not utterly
unfurnished with those Skills and Helps, which might make
the Work Intelligible and Acceptable even to Plebeians. For
though it was at first designed by the Excellent Author in his
<hi>Latin</hi> for such as were meerly Lawyers and Scholars (they must
be both, that mean to understand it as he wrote it) yet now
it being done into <hi>English,</hi> it was to be calculated to the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
of common Capacities and vulgar Understandings.
Which end he hath, he hopes, in some good measure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered;
and in order to which end, he hath, to supply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of his <hi>Translation,</hi> at the end of the Book subjoyned some
<hi>Annotations,</hi> which may serve partly to clear the Author's
meaning, and partly to vindicate himself in the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He did think once to have affixt those <hi>Annotations</hi> to the
places they belong to; but upon second and better thoughts,
he consider'd, that the Authors <hi>Quotations</hi> would be enow of
themselves to charge the <hi>Margin</hi> with, and a further superfoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb facs="tcp:108530:5"/>
would but cloy and surbate the Reader; though in the
body of the Work, there are up and down many Explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
inserted, to excuse him from the trouble of having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to those Notes, which are added out of pure necessity,
and not from any vanity of Ostentation, since the whole, if it
had its due, might seem to require a perpetual <hi>Comment.</hi> In
the main, which is enough for a <hi>Translator,</hi> be his <hi>Author</hi> what
he will, he doth assure thee, that the meanest Subject of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
may now read one of her greatest Champions and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
(for Learned Pens sometimes do as good and as great
service as Valiant Swords do) so understandingly, that he
may edifie and learn, what duty and deference he ought to
have for the Best of Governments.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>Reader,</hi> excuse me in a Digression, and do not
impute it as a Levity to me, that I follow my Grave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
It is my Duty so to do; it is my Happiness, if I can:
He doth not despair, now he appears in <hi>English,</hi> to have <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male-Readers</hi>
too, to court him so far at least as to peruse his
Translation, who hath so highly courted them with Noble
Caresses in that Chapter, wherein he hath so learnedly plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Excellencies and Rights of that <hi>Angelical Sex,</hi> (if
Angels have any Sex) to the abashment and overthrow of
the <hi>Salick</hi> Law. To what purpose did the <hi>Author</hi> write so
much in their Commendation, if they were not to know it?
which, if the poor <hi>Translator</hi> hath any Obligations upon the
Sex, he hopes they will own this as an Addition: not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that other Chapter of his, where, like a Gentleman and
a Lawyer both, he maintains that freedom peculiar to our
<hi>English Ladies,</hi> and which with Lawyers leave, I may call <hi>The
Courtesie of England,</hi> in receiving of Salutes, against the censure of
Rudeness on the one hand, and the suspicion of Wantonness on
the other. Though I must confess also, that some of his Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in that defence, are so free, that I thought fit rather to
leave them as I found them, than by putting them into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi>
to expose the Modesty of the Sex.</p>
            <p>I have no more to say, <hi>Reader,</hi> but to beg thy Excuse, for
any thing, wherein I may appear to have come short of the
Weighty and Abstruse Senses of our Great and Worthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
and that I may detain thee no longer from his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
to bid thee <hi>Farewell.</hi>

he is in the humour to declare both the Occasion
of drawing the first Furrow of this Enterprize, and
also the Model and Frame of the whole Work, what it is, finished and
compleated. It is a long while ago, considering how young a man I am,
since from the first I have made it my hearty wish, that the ancient Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
and Procedure of our <hi>Civil Law</hi> might more fairly and clearly be
made out; as far, I mean, as the thing will bear, and as what store we
have of publick Records affords assistance.</p>

Some spare hours have been spent by me in reading over <hi>Historians,
Chronologers, Antiquaries,</hi> Foreigners and our own Countrey-men,
those of Ancient date and the more polite of the Modern sort: those
especially who seem'd to make out the quickest course to that Goal and
design I spoke of. I have carefully cull'd out whatsoever I met with,
that lookt like the Orders and Decisions of <hi>Praetors</hi> or Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices,
and whatsoever concerns the <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Prophane Law. (Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane</hi>

                  </gap>xtus Pompeius</hi> hath taught me.) I did judge that there were a
great many things in those Writers worth the knowing, and which might
deserve to be digested into a kind of Volume according to order of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology,
I did in the first place advise, and took that special order with
my self, that as to this undertaking, I might with the greater ease have
my Attendants ready at hand to wait upon my Studies. I went about to

               </gap> and cement, such as it is, (<hi>i. e.</hi> some method and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion)
to the scattered and disjointed bulk, and I brought it to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion;
and assoon as it came into my mind to publish it, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
according to that meanness, which it appears in, to finish it
(that I may make use of a Mathematick term) with its Complement.
I have set the model and frame upon a sure account (not upon mine
<pb facs="tcp:108530:7"/>
own credit neither, who am too apt to take on trust things suspected)
<hi>and in a compendious way:</hi> I have writ my self compendiously and

purpose vouch the credit, I go upon, to be none of mine, but the Authors,
I have taken out of, that I may not be accused of false dealing by unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
or careless Readers. I have applyed my self not only to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Writers, or to their historical account, but even to the very
words and syllables, which they spoke, and have inserted them printed
in a different character; those, I confess, unless it be from them of the
middle age, many times sufficiently barbarous, that miserably want po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing,
such as Criticks cannot away with, and do very well agree with
the Records and Reports of Law, which we converse with. However

they are of a far more ancient Date. For it is a remark amongst
Statesmen, That new acquired Empires, do run some hazard by attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to make new Laws: and the <hi>Norman</hi> did warily provide against
this danger, by bestowing upon the yielding conquered Nation the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital
of their ancient Law: a requital, I say, but more, as it should
seem, for shew than use; and rather to curry favour with the people at
the present, than in good deed for the advantage of the <hi>English</hi>
Name. Wherein he in some measure followed well near the practice of
<hi>Alaricus,</hi> who having conquered the <hi>Romans,</hi> and finding that they
took it in dudgeon to be bound up by the Laws of the <hi>Goths,</hi> though in
other things they were compliant enough, restored to them the <hi>Roman</hi>
Laws, but by sly interpretations against the sense and meaning of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Laws he drew these Laws back again to the <hi>Gothish.</hi> For
the times on this side the <hi>Normans</hi> entrance, are so full of new Laws,
especially such as belong to the right of Tenancy or Vassalage; though
other Laws have been carefully enough kept up from the time of the

Decrees of that Blazing-Star, which appeared in the <hi>Easter</hi> of that

Kingdom (a thing which Astrologers affirm) so the abolition of our
Laws; and yet in some sense peradventure an alteration of them both;

without a world of rubs in the way and slips or distances of years, I saw
I was not able to put upon the work the face of a History, and to muster
up all things that are wanting. Very many things are so effaced by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
of time, several things have been lost through neglect, nor is the
Learned World under a small discontent, or at small variance by reason
of this loss. These remains, which are left us, to be handled upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
I have alwayes accounted pleasant researches: I, and perhaps one
may say, that those Learned Pieces, which <hi>Pomponius, Rivallius,
Zasius, Oldendorp, Brissonius,</hi> and others, have published concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Twelve Tables, and the Laws written upon Oaken Planks,
upon Elephants Skins, and in former Ages upon Brass, are not of more
use and advantage for the City <hi>Spire</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> than these Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may be for <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> amongst us. We have said enough
and to spare, concerning the model and frame of the Work. For me
now to beg the Readers pardon, that I may speak a little concerning my
self, seeing it was at my own choice, whether I would give him trouble
or no, would be silly. I so be that any one shall shew himself more

               <p>Well, as the Commentary of <hi>Annius</hi> has it, <q>This <hi>Samothes</hi> was
Brother to <hi>Gomar</hi> and <hi>Tubal</hi> by their Father <hi>Japhet,</hi> from whom first
the <hi>Britans,</hi> then the <hi>Gauls</hi> were called <hi>Samothei;</hi> and especially the
Philosophers and Divines that were his followers.</q> And out of
<hi>Laertius</hi> he tells us, <q>For it is evident, that among the <hi>Persians</hi> the
<hi>Magi</hi> flourished, among the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Assyrians</hi> the <hi>Chaldeans</hi>
were famous, among the <hi>Celts</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> the <hi>Druids,</hi> and those who
were called <hi>Samothei;</hi> who, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Magick, and <hi>Sotion</hi> in
his Three and Twentieth Book of Successions do witness, were men
very well skilled in Laws Divine and Humane, and upon that account
were much addicted to Religion; and were for that reason termed
<hi>Samothei.</hi>
                  </q> These very words you meet with in <hi>Annius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The name of <hi>Laertius</hi> is pretended, and the beginning of his Volume
concerning the Lives of Philosophers. Why then let us read <hi>Laertius</hi>
himself; <q>and amongst the <hi>Celts</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> (saith he) the <hi>Semnothei</hi>
as saith <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Book of Magick, and <hi>Sotion</hi> in his Three and
Twentieth of Succession.</q> Concerning the <hi>Samothei</hi> any other wayes
there is not so much as one syllable. That they were men well skilled
in Laws Divine and Humane, or that they had their name given them
upon that account, only the <hi>Latin</hi> and foisted Edition of B. <hi>Brognol</hi> the
<hi>Venetian</hi> has told us: whereas in truth, in all the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Copies
of <hi>Laertius,</hi> which that great Scholar <hi>Harry Stephen</hi> saw and consulted
with (and he sayes he perused Eight or Nine) there is no mention at
all made of that business.</p>
               <p>And yet for all that, I cannot perswade my self, that it was only for
want of care, or by meer chance, that this slipt into the Glosses: It does
appear, that there have been able Lawyers and Master Philosophers not
only among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and those of <hi>Italy;</hi> but also among
the <hi>Northern</hi> Nations, however Barbarous. Witness the <hi>Druids</hi> among
us,<note place="margin">Jornand. de 1th. Goth. c. 11.</note> and among the <hi>Goths,</hi> as <hi>Jornandes</hi> tells us, besides <hi>Cosmicus,</hi> one
<hi>Diceneus,</hi> who, being at once King of Men, and Priest of <hi>Phoebus,</hi> did to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with Natural Philosophy and other parts of good Learning,
transmit to posterity a Body of Laws, which they called <hi>Bellagines;</hi> that
is, By-Laws.</p>
               <p>There are some, who in <hi>Laertius</hi> read <hi>Samothei;</hi> which is a device
of those men, who with too much easiness (they are <hi>Isaac Casaubon</hi>'s
words) that I may say no worse, suffer themselves to be led by the
Nose by that counterfeit <hi>Berosus.</hi>

               <p>ANd indeed if the <hi>Samothei</hi> had any thing to do with truth, or the
<hi>Semnothei</hi> any thing to do with the ancient Law of the <hi>Celts</hi> (in
as much as they write, that <hi>Britany</hi> was once in subjection to the <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>

that is, <hi>The Worshipful Gods;</hi> or for that they themselves were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
amongst men as a kind of Worshipful Gods: but, writes he,
this latter I do not take to be so likely as the former.</q> But say I for
my part, if I might venture my opinion against the judgement of so
great a person, I guess this latter to be the likelier of the two.</p>
               <p>That the old <hi>Heroes</hi> went by the names of Gods, is a thing we read
every where; nor did Antiquity grudge the bestowal of this honour
even upon <hi>Philosophers.</hi> Not upon <hi>Amphiaraus</hi> the Prophet; not upon
<hi>Aesculapius,</hi> not upon <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> renowned Physicians; they are recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
among the middle sort of Gods.<note place="margin">Aug. de Civ. Dei, l. 2. c. 14. Laert. lib. 5.</note> Thus <hi>Plato</hi> also was accounted by
<hi>Antistius Labeo</hi> for a Demy-god, and <hi>Tyrtamus</hi> for his Divine eloquence,
had the name of <hi>Theophrastus</hi> (that is, God-like Speaker) given him
by his Master <hi>Aristotle.</hi> No wonder then, if thereupon thence forward
great Philosophers were called <hi>Semnothei,</hi> and as it were Worshipful
Gods. These instances incline me, whilst I only take a view of their
Philosophy; whom, if either the authority of <hi>Annius,</hi> or the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Brognol</hi> had sufficiently and fairly made out to have been also
at the same time Students and Masters of Law, I should hardly stick al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
to affirm, that I had found out in what places the true natural
spring and source both of their name, and as I may say, of their dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
power is to be met with.</p>
               <p>For I have it in <hi>Pausanias</hi> (forbear your flouts, because I waft over
into <hi>Greece,</hi> from whence the most ancient Customs both Sacred and
Prophane of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> came) I say in <hi>Pausanias</hi> the most diligent

whom the <hi>Athenians</hi> termed <hi>Semnai,</hi> the <hi>Sicyomans</hi> called <hi>Eumenides.</hi>
The story of <hi>Orestes</hi> and the <hi>Eumenides</hi> or Furies that haunted him is
known to every body, nor can you tell me of any little smatterer in
Poetry, who doth not know, that they, together with <hi>Adrastia, Ramnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,

be the Avengers of Villanies, and continually to assist <hi>Jupiter</hi> the great
God in punishing the wicked actions of Mortals. They were black
ones that met with <hi>Orestes,</hi> but that there were white ones too, to whom
together with the <hi>Graces</hi> the Ancients paid their Devotions; the same
<hi>Pausanias</hi> has left written in his Survey of <hi>Arcadia.</hi> I let pass that in
the same Author, she whom some called <hi>Erinnys,</hi> that is a <hi>Fury;</hi>
others called <hi>Themis</hi> the Goddess of <hi>Justice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be brief and plain; the <hi>Furies,</hi> that is, the Avenging Goddesses
sit upon the skirts of the wicked; but the <hi>Eumenides,</hi> that is, the

fly to them for refuge, he should have pardon in the presence of his

gathered out of ancient Writers, whereof he wanted no store.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He first used a Golden Crown, appointed Weights and Measures
for selling and buying of things, punisht Thieves and all mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
sorts of men with the greatest severity; made a great many
High-wayes; and gave order, how broad they should be, and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Law, that the right of those Wayes belonged only to the
Prince; and set dreadful Penalties upon their heads, who should vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
that right, alike as upon theirs who should commit any misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
in those wayes. Moreover, that the Land might not
lye barren, nor the people be frequently oppressed or lessened
through Dearth or want of Corn, if Cattle alone should possess the
Fields, which ought to be tilled by men, he appointed how many
Ploughs every County should have, and set a penalty upon them by
whose means that number should he diminished: And he made a
Law, That Labouring Beasts which attended the Plough, should not
be distrained by Officers, nor assigned over to Creditors for money
that was owing, if the Debtor had any other Goods left.</q> Thus

years ago there was nothing that our Ancestors heard with greater

the first times there were no Positive Laws; yet mention made of
them in some very ancient Authors, notwithstanding a remark of
some ancient Writers to the contrary.</head>
               <p>WEll! Suppose we grant there was such a Person ever in the

out of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Laws; but what I pray were those <hi>Trojan</hi> Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?
There is one, I know well enough, they speak of, concerning
the Prerogative of the eldest Sons, by which they inherited the whole
Right and Estate of their deceased Father. <hi>Herodotus</hi> writes it of <hi>Hector,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Herodot. in Euterpe.</note>
Son and Heir to King <hi>Priam,</hi> and <hi>Jeoffry</hi> mentions it; but did this Law
cross the Sea with <hi>Brutus</hi> into <hi>Brittany?</hi> How then came it, that the
Kingdom was divided betwixt the three Brothers, <hi>Locrinus, Camber,</hi>
and <hi>Albanactus?</hi> betwixt the two, <hi>Ferrix</hi> and <hi>Porrix?</hi> betwixt <hi>Brennus</hi>

of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth,<note place="margin">Stat. 37 Hen. 8. c. 26.</note> provision was made, that the Free-holds
of <hi>Wales</hi> should not thence-forward pass according to that custom, which
they call <hi>Gavelkind?</hi> And anciently, if I be not mistaken, most
Inheritances were parted among the Children, as we find in <hi>Hesiods</hi> works.

i. e. <q>We had already parted the Estate.</q>
And to the same purpose many like passages there are in old Poets, and

the same with those, by which <hi>Nephelococcygia,</hi> the City of the Birds in

                  <p>2. If any private person or body of men do not stand to their award,
they excommunicate him, that is, forbid him to come to sacrifice,
which among them is the most grievous punishment.</p>
                  <p>3. Those who are thus excommunicated, are accounted wicked and
ungodly wretches, every body goes out of their way, and shuns their
company and conversation for fear of getting any harm by contagion.

the <hi>Greek</hi> ones (as also the <hi>Russian</hi> Characters do at this day) and
that those which are now <hi>Latin</hi> letters, were at first brought over into
<hi>Italy</hi> out of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> along with <hi>Nicostrata</hi> the Mother of <hi>Evander,</hi> who

               <p>But that which seems to put the matter out of all dispute, <hi>Caesar</hi> being
about to write to <hi>Quintus Cicero,</hi>

to know their design. To what purpose should he have done this, if
that Chevalier, who was a <hi>Gaul,</hi> or if the <hi>Gauls,</hi> or if the very <hi>Druids</hi>

               <p>If so be our interpretation of that form of <hi>Caesars</hi> speaking, which we
brought, do not please (as to <hi>Strabo's</hi> testimony, that respects some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

be of opinion, that the word <hi>Graecis</hi> crept into this Story, either by the

were of the oldest standing among the Philosophers of the Gentiles, and
the most ancient among their Guardians of Laws. For grant they were
of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his School, yet even at that rate they are brought back at
least to the fiftieth or sixtieth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> or if thou wilt, to the Tyranny
of the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> which is about two and twenty hundred years ago. 'Tis
true, <hi>Pliny, Cicero, Austin, Eusebius</hi> disagree in this point; nor will I
catch that mistake by the handle, which draws him, meaning <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>
back to <hi>Numa's time.</hi>

               <p>To what hath been said, I shall not grudge to subjoyn a Surplage out
of <hi>Conradus Celtes.</hi> He is speaking of some ancient Images of stone,
which he had seen in a certain Abby at the foot of a Hill that bears Pines,
commonly called <hi>Vichtelberg,</hi> in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Voitland,</hi> which
he conceives did by way of Statue represent the <hi>Druids.</hi> 
                  <q>They were
six in number, says he,<note place="margin">Apud P. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulam in Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogr. part 2. lib. 3.</note> at the door of the Temple niched into the Wall,
of seven foot apiece in height, bare-footed, having their Heads un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
with a Greekish Cloak on, and that Hooded, and a Satchel
or scrip by their side, their Beard hanging down to their very Privities,
and forked or parted in two about their Nostrils; in their Hands a Book
and a Staff like that of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> with a severe Forehead and a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Brow, stooping down with their Head, and fastening their Eyes
on the ground.</q> Which description, how it agrees with those things
which are recounted by <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Strabo,</hi> concerning the Golden adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

                  <hi>Camden</hi> is of opinion, that the custom of Coining Money, came in

<hi>Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire</hi> and <hi>Hartfordshire.</hi> He takes notice out of
<hi>William</hi> the Conqueror's Book of Rates or <hi>Dooms-Day</hi> Book (which is
seasonable to mention upon this Head of Coins) that as amongst the
old <hi>Romans,</hi> so amongst our Ancestors, money was weighed (as <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vase</hi>
of <hi>Tilbury</hi> also tells us) and so told out and paid down. Now
they paid Customs to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and for this purpose they had Coins
stamped and marked with various shapes of living Creatures and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables,<note place="margin">V. Plut. quaest. centuriat. Rom. 41.</note>
which ever and anon are digged up out of the ground. And

whom both Maids and married Women do easily afford, and civilly too,
them that salute them a kiss, not such as <hi>Catullus</hi> speaks of Billing like

Seats and Grounds, and the Town it self (if there were one to
be built) and prescribed them Rules and Rights, and the form as it
were of a new Common-wealth: Yet in that manner, that all things
might bear a resemblance of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Mother City; and that in
the very places themselves the Courts of Law, the Capitols, the
Temples, the State-houses or Town-halls might be according to that
model, and that there might be in the Government or Magistracy
two persons as Bailiffs in most places, like the two <hi>Consuls</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi>
in like manner Surveyors and Scavengers, Aldermen of the Wards and

taken upon you in the Kingdom of <hi>Britanny</hi> the Law and Faith of

Prince King <hi>Lucy</hi> hath been imbezill'd and smuggled, this upon the
credit of the ancient Writers appears plainly, that the pitiful fopperies
of the Pagans, and the Worship of their Idol-Devils did begin to flag,
and within a short time would have given place to the Worship of the
true God, and that Three <hi>Arch-Flamens</hi> and Twenty Eight <hi>Flamens, i. e.</hi>
Arch-Priests, being driven out, there were as many Arch-Bishops and
Bishops put into their rooms (the Seats of the Arch-Bishops were at
<hi>London,</hi> at <hi>York</hi> and at <hi>Caerleon</hi> in <hi>Wales</hi>) <q>to whom, as also to other
Religious persons, the King granted Possessions and Territories in
abundance, and confirmed his Grants by Charters and Patents. But
he ordered the Churches (as he of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and <hi>Florilegus</hi> tell us)
to be so free, that whatsoever Malefactor should fly thither for refuge,
there he might abide secure, and no body hurt him.</q>

have a War, by what way soever they can catch him, and
chose out one of their own Countrey-men; and putting on each of
them the Arms of their own Countrey, make them two fight toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and judge of the Victory, according as the one or the other of
them shall overcome.</q> This very thing also <hi>Tacitus</hi> himself hath, to
whom <hi>Einhard</hi> sends his Reader. For though he treat in general of the
<hi>Germans,</hi> yet nevertheless without any question, our <hi>Saxons</hi> brought
over along with them into this Island very many of those things, which
are delivered to us by those who have wrote concerning the Customs
of the <hi>Germans.</hi> Among which, take these following.</p>
               <p>25. <q>In Councils or publick Assemblies, the King or Prince, (<hi>i. e.</hi> a
chief person) according as every ones Age is, according to his Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
according to his Reputation in Arms, according to his Eloquence,
has audience given him, where they use the authority of perswading,
rather than the power of commanding. If they dislike what he sayes,
they disapprove it with a Hum and a rude noise. If they like the
proposal, they shake and rustle their Spears or Partisans together.
It is the most honourable kind of assent, to commend the Speaker with
the clattering of their Arms.</q> From hence perhaps arose the ancient
right of <hi>Wapentakes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>26. <q>There are also chosen at the same Councils or Meetings, chief
persons (as Justices) to administer Law in the several Villages and
Hamlets. Each of those have a hundred Associates out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty
for their Counsel and Authority.</q> This is plainly the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traict
of our <hi>Hundreds,</hi> which we still have throughout the Counties
of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>27. <q>They do nothing of publick or private affair, but with their
Arms on; but it is not the custom for any one to wear Arms, before
the City or Community approve of him as sufficient for it. Then
in the Council it self, either some one of the Princes or chief persons,
or the Father of the young man or some Kinsman of his in token of
respect, give him a Shield and a Partisan. This with them stands
for the Ceremony of the Gown; this the first honour of youth arriving
at manhood; before this be done, they seem but a part of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</q>
but after this is over, they are a part of the Common-wealth.

had been made by former Kings, and especially by his Predecessor <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelred,</hi>

that he appointed them, but that he observed them.</q> The Laws of
<hi>Edward,</hi> who for his piety has the sirname of <hi>Confessor,</hi> are in Readers

these Remarks, as being to our purpose; and taken from the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
As for instance, that those are most frequent whereby Estates are convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be held with the best and fairest right; yet most commonly these
three things excepted, to wit, <hi>Expedition,</hi> Repairing of <hi>Bridges,</hi> and
Building of <hi>Castles:</hi> And that those to whom the Grants were made,
were very seldom acquitted upon this account. These three exceptions
are noted by the term of a <hi>three-knotted necessity</hi> in an old Charter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

Upon which account, some while since the coming in of the <hi>Normans,</hi>
there was not in <hi>England</hi> except the King himself, any one, who held
Land by right of <hi>Free-hold</hi> (as they term it:) since in sooth one may

               <p>
                  <q>Some of these <hi>English</hi> Laws he disliked and laid aside; others he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of, and added to them, some from beyond Sea out of <hi>Neustria</hi>
                  </q> (he

               <p>Now this is no rare thing among Writers for them to devise, that <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
the Conqueror brought in as it were a clear new face of Laws to all
intents and purposes. 'Tis true, this must be acknowledg'd, that he
did make some new ones (part whereof you may see in <hi>Lambard</hi>'s <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeonomia,</hi>
and part of them here subjoyned) but so however that they
take their denomination from the <hi>English,</hi> rather than from the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi>
although one may truly say, according to what Lawyers dispute,
that the <hi>English</hi> Empire and Government was overthrown by him. That
he did more especially affect the Laws of the <hi>Danes</hi> (which were not
much unlike to those of the <hi>Norwegians,</hi> to whom <hi>William</hi> was by his
Grand-father allied in blood) I read in the Annals of <hi>Roger Hoveden.</hi>
And that he openly declared, that he would rule by them; <q>at hearing
of which, all the great men of the Countrey, who had enacted the
<hi>English</hi> Laws, were presently struck into dumps, and did unanimously
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108530:42"/>
petition him, That he would permit them to have their own Laws
and ancient Customs; in which their Fathers had lived, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
had been born and bred up in; forasmuch as it would be very
hard for them to take up Laws that they knew not, and to give judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
according to them. But the King appearing unwilling and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie
to be moved, they at length prosecuted their purpose, beseeching
him, that for the Soul of King <hi>Edward,</hi> who had after his death given
up the Crown and Kingdom to him<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and whose the Laws were, and not
any others that were strangers, he would hearken to them and grant
that they might continue under their own Countrey Laws. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
calling a Council, he did at the last yield to the request of the
Barons. From that day forward therefore the Laws of King <hi>Edward,</hi>
which had before been made and appointed by his Grand-father <hi>Adgar,</hi>
seeing their authority, were before the rest of the Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
respected, confirmed and observed all over <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q> But what
then? Doth it follow that all things in <hi>William</hi>'s time were new? How
can a man chuse but believe it? The Abbot of <hi>Crowland</hi> sayes this of it,
<q>I have brought with me from <hi>London</hi> into my Monastery the Laws of
the most Righteous King <hi>Edward,</hi> which my Renowned Lord King
<hi>William</hi> hath by Proclamation ordered, under most grievous penalties,
to be authentick and perpetual, to be kept inviolably throughout
the whole Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and hath recommended them to his
Justices, in the same language wherein they were at first set forth
and published.</q> And in the Life of <hi>Fretherick</hi> Abbot of S. <hi>Albans</hi> you
have this account: <q>After many debates, Arch-Bishop <hi>Lanfrank</hi> being
then present (at <hi>Berkhamstead</hi> in <hi>Hartfordshire</hi>) the King did for the
good of peace, take his Oath upon all the Reliques of the Church of
S. <hi>Alban,</hi> and by touching the holy Gospels,<note place="margin">Camden.</note> 
                     <hi>Fretherick</hi> the Abbot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring
the Oath, that he would inviolably observe the good and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
ancient Laws of the Kingdom, which the holy and pious Kings
of <hi>England</hi> his Predecessors, and especially King <hi>Edward</hi> had appointed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But you will much more wonder at that passage of <hi>William le Rouille</hi>
of <hi>AlenÃ§on</hi> in his Preface to the <hi>Norman</hi> Customs. <q>That vulgar Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle,<note place="margin">Guil. lÃ¨ Rouille Alencon.</note>
saith he, which is intitled the <hi>Chronicle of Chronicles,</hi> bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that S. <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> was the Maker or Founder of
this Custom; where he speaks of <hi>William</hi> the Bastard Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,
alias</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> saying, that whereas the foresaid S. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
had no Heirs of his own Body, he made <hi>William</hi> Heir of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
who after the Defeat and Death of <hi>Harald</hi> the Usurper of the
Kingdom, did freely obtain and enjoy the Kingdom upon this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to wit, that he would keep the Laws which had before been made
by the fore-mentioned <hi>Edward;</hi> which <hi>Edward</hi> truly had also given
Laws to the <hi>Normans,</hi> as having been a long time also brought up
himself in <hi>Normandy.</hi>

               <p>Where then, I pray you, is the making of new Laws? Why! with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, according to <hi>Tilbury,</hi> we are to think, that together with
the ratifying of old Laws, there was mingled the making of some
new ones: and in this case one may say truly with the Poet in his
Panegyrick:

               <p>Reader, If it will not make thy nice Stomach wamble, let me bring
in here an old fashioned Rhyme, which will hardly go down with our
dainty finical Verse-wrights, of an historical Poet <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Glocester:</hi>
One whom, for his Antiquity, I must not slight concerning this
Book.</p>

               <p>Considering how the <hi>English</hi> Language is every day more and more
refined, this is but a rude piece, and looks scurvily enough. But yet
let us not be unmindful neither, that even the fine trim artifices of our
quaint Masters of Expression, will themselves perhaps one day, in future
Ages, that shall be more critical, run the same risk of censure, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
the like misfortune: And that,

                  </q>
As <hi>Horace</hi> the Poet born at <hi>Venusium,</hi> tells us: That is,
<q>
                     <l>Several words which now are fal'n full low,</l>
                     <l>Shall up again to place of Honour start;</l>

               <p>2. <q>The <hi>Normans</hi> called their Writings given under their hand, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
(I speak this out of <hi>Ingulph</hi>) and they ordered the confirmation of
such Charters with an impression of Wax, by every ones particular
Seal, under the Testimony and Subscription of three or four Witnesses
standing by.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Edward the Confessor</hi> had also his Seal, though that too from <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy.</hi>
For in his time, as the same Writer saith, <q>Many of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
began to let slip and lay aside the <hi>English</hi> Fashions, bringing in
those of the <hi>Normans</hi> in their stead, and in many things to follow the
customs of the <hi>Franks;</hi> all great persons to speak the <hi>French</hi> Tongue in
their Courts, looking upon it as a great piece of gentility, to make
their Charters and Writings <hi>alamode of France;</hi> and to be ashamed of
their own Country usages in these and other like cases.</q> Nay, and if
<hi>Leland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Leland.</note> an Eye-witness, may be believed, our great Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> had
his Seal also, which he saith he saw in the Church of <hi>Westminster</hi> with
this very inscription.
<q>PATRITIUS. ARTHURIUS. BRITANNIAE.
GALLIAE. GERMANIAE. DACIAE. IMPERATOR.</q>
That is,
<hi>The Right Noble,</hi> ARTHUR, <hi>Emperor of</hi> Britanny, France, Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<hi>and</hi> Transylvania.</p>
               <p>But that the <hi>Saxons</hi> had this from the <hi>Normans,</hi> is a thing out of all
question. Their Grants or Letters Patents signed with Crosses, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
with Witnesses names, do give an undoubted credit and assurance
to what I have said. <hi>John Ross</hi> informs us that <hi>Henry Beauclerk</hi> was the
first that made use of one of Wax;<note place="margin">Matth. Cantu. in Antiq. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Britan.</note> and <hi>Matthew of Canterbury,</hi> that <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the first did first hang it at the bottom of his Royal Writings by way
of Label; whereas before, his Predecessors fastned it to the left side. Such
a writing of <hi>Henry</hi> the first in favour of <hi>Anselm,</hi> the last Author makes
mention of; and such an one of <hi>William</hi>'s Duke of the <hi>Normans,</hi> though
a very short one and very small written;<note place="margin">Tuin. apol. ant Oxon. lib. 1. Â§. 81.</note> 
                  <hi>Brian-Twine</hi> in his <hi>Apology for

               </p>
               <p>But let a circumcised <hi>Jew,</hi> or who else will for me, believe that story
concerning the first Seal of Wax, and the first fastning of it to the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
A great many waxen ones of the <hi>French</hi> Peers (that I may say
something of those in wax) and Golden ones of their Kings (to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

the years 600 and 700) we meet with fashioned like Scutcheons or
Coats of Arms in those Patterns or Copies which <hi>Francis de Rosieres</hi> has
in his first Tome of the Pedigree or Blazonry of the Dukes of <hi>Lorain,</hi>
set down by way of Preface. Nor was it possible that the <hi>Normans</hi>
should not have that in use, which had been so anciently practised by the
<hi>French.</hi> Let me add this out of the ancient Register of <hi>Abendon:</hi> 
                  <q>That
<hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Chester</hi> (who flourished in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the first)
ordered to sign a certain Writing with the Seal of his Mother <hi>Ermentrude;</hi>

seeing that (being not girt with a Soldiers Belt, <hi>i. e.</hi> not yet made
Knight) all sorts of Letters directed by him, were inclosed with his
Mothers Seal.</q>
               </p>
               <p>How? what is that I hear? Had the Knightly dignity and Order the
singular priviledge, as it was once at <hi>Rome,</hi> to wear Gold-Rings? For
Rings (as 'tis related out of <hi>Ateius Capito</hi>) were especially designed and
ingraven for Seals:<note place="margin">Macrob. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. lib. 7. cap. 13.</note> Let <hi>Phoebus,</hi> who knows all things, out of his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
tell us. For Servants or Slaves (so says <hi>Justus Lipsius,</hi> and remarks it
from those that had been dug up in <hi>Holland</hi>) and common Soldiers were
allowed iron ones to sign or to seal with (which therefore <hi>Flavius Vopiscus</hi>
calls <hi>annulos sigillaricios, i. e.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vopisc. in Aurel.</note> seal-Rings) and so your ordinary Masters of
Families had such, with a Key hanging at it to seal and lock up their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
and utensils. <q>But,<note place="margin">Lips. ad 2. Annal. Tacit. num. 4.</note> saith <hi>Ateius</hi> of the ancient time, Neither
was it lawful to have more than one Ring, nor for any one to have one
neither but for Freemen, whom alone trust might become, which is
preserved under Seal; and therefore the Servants of a Family had not
the Right and Priviledge of Rings. I come home to our selves now.</q>

of, with Wine; and before the Altar upon his bended knees, drinking
it, gave away to God and to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Prince of the Apostles, all his
Lands and Revenues.</q> Which Horn of his, saith <hi>Camden,</hi> we have been
told was kept or reserved down to our Fathers memory. We may see
the conveyance of Estate, how easie it was in those days, and clear from
the punctilio's of Law, and withal how free from the captious malice
of those petty-foggers who would intangle Titles and find flaws in them,

pleaded in <hi>French.</hi> That also in Schools the Rudiments of Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

Also that the <hi>English</hi> way and manner of Writing was laid aside, and
the <hi>French</hi> mode was made use of in all Charters or Instruments and
Books.</q>
               </p>

Vlstan</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> was censured as unworthy of his place,
and deprived of his dignity, who as to other things according to the
simplicity of that Age, was Scholar enough. The Abbot whom I quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
speaks thus of the <hi>French</hi> Character: <q>The <hi>Saxon</hi> hand was used by
all the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Mercians</hi> in all their hand-writings, till the time
of King <hi>Alfred,</hi> who had by <hi>French</hi> Tutors been very well trained up
in all Literature; but from the time of the said King, it did by disuse
come to be of little account; and the <hi>French</hi> hand, because it being
more legible and more delightful to sight, had the preheminence, grew
more and more every day in vogue and use among all the <hi>English.</hi>
                  </q> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
however this business went, we are told that in the memory
of our Fathers, and that by an ancient order, there were Lectures of the
<hi>English-Saxon</hi> language, read at <hi>Tavistock</hi> Abby in <hi>Devonshire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. That his new Kingdom might not be disturbed by Riots and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
in the night, he ordered that at the Ringing of a Bell (which
they called the <hi>Curfew</hi>-Bell) all the Lights and Fires should in every little
Cottage,<note place="margin">Polydorus. <hi>Coverfeu.</hi>
                  </note> a little after the dusk of the Evening, be put out.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>6. He that should take a Deer, or <hi>aprum,</hi> a Boar (so says <hi>Huntingdon,</hi>
but perhaps 'tis <hi>caprum,</hi> a Buck) or a Roe, was to have his eyes thrust
or plucked out, saith <hi>Matthew Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. If any one had slain any one ('tis <hi>Huntingdon</hi> writes this) be it
upon what cause or occasion soever, he was sentenced to a Capital pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
he was to die for it</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <q>8. If one had forced any woman (so I read <hi>aliquam</hi> any woman, not
<hi>aliquem</hi> any man, as 'tis in the common Prints) he was to have his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities
cut off.</q> Forced her? I, sure enough; and perhaps he that lay
with a woman with her consent, was notwithstanding that, served in the
same kind too. And in this case I would have you hear what that great
Lawyer <hi>Albericus Gentilis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Alberic. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til. de jure bell. lib. 1. c. 20.</note> his opinion is. <q>This I say, saith he, that a
man hath a greater injury done him, if the woman were not ravished

               <p>
                  <q>12. In the Primitive State of the Kingdom after the Conquest </q>(<hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vase
of Tilbury</hi> in his Dialogue of the Exchequer, saith, this is a thing
handled down from our Forefathers) <q>the Kings had payments made
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108530:46"/>
them out of their Lands, not in sums of Gold or Silver, but only in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals
or Provisions: Out of which the Kings house was supplied with
necessaries for daily use; and they who were deputed to this service (the
<hi>Purveyors</hi>) knew what quantity arose from each several land. But
yet as to Soldiers pay or donatives, and for other necessaries concerning
the Pleas of the Kingdom, or Conventions, as also from Cities and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
where they did not exercise Husbandry or Tillage; in such instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
payments were made in ready mony. Wherefore this Institution
lasted all the time of <hi>William</hi> the First, to the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> his
Son, so that I my self (<hi>Gervase</hi> flourished in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond) have seen some people, who did at set times carry from the Kings
Lands, victuals or provisions of food to Court. And the Officers also
of the Kings house knew very well, having it upon account, which
Counties were to send in Wheat, which to send in several sorts of flesh,
and Provender for the Horses. These things being paid according to
the appointed manner and proportion of every thing, the Kings
Officers reckoned to the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> by reducing it into a sum of
pence; to wit, for a measure of Wheat to make bread for a hundred
men, one shilling; for the body of a pasture-fed Beef, one shilling;
for a Ram or a Sheep four pence; for the allowance of twenty horses
likewise four pence: But in process of time, when as the said King was
busie in remote parts beyond Sea to appease Tumults and Insurrections;
it so happened, that ready mony was highly necessary for him to supply
his occasions. In the mean time, there came in multitudes, a great
company of Husbandmen with complaints to the Kings Court, or which
troubled him more, they frequently came in his way as he was passing
by, holding up their Ploughshares, in token that their Husbandry was
running to decay; for they were put to a world of trouble, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the provisions which they carried from their own quarters
through several parts of the Kingdom. Thereupon the King being
moved with their complaints, did by the resolved advice of his Lords,
appoint throughout the Kingdom such persons, as he knew were, for
their prudence and discretion, fit for the service. These persons going
about, and that they might believe their own eyes, taking a view of
the several Lands, having made an estimate of the provisions which
were paid out of them, they reduced it into a sum of pence. But for
the total sum, which arose out of all the Lands in one County, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that the <hi>Sheriff</hi> of that County should be bound to the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer:</q>
Adding this withal, that he should pay it at the <hi>Scale.</hi> Now
the manner of paying, the tryal of the weight and of the metal by Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
operation, the Melter or Coyner, and the surveyor of the Mint,
are more largely handled and explained by my self in some other work
of mine.</p>

hold Pleas in the Hundred concerning Episcopal Laws; nor bring any
cause which belongs to the Government of Souls (<hi>i. e.</hi> to spiritual affairs)

Episcopal Laws, shall for what cause or fault soever be summoned, shall
come to a place which the Bishop shall chuse and name for this purpose;
and there make answer concerning his cause, and do right to God and
his Bishop, not according to the Hundred, but according to the Canons
and Episcopal Laws.</q> For in the time of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Empire, there were

upon the authority of the man, in comparison of whose Rose-beds (if
you well weigh the Learning of that Age) the other pack of Writers

Monk,<note place="margin">De mirac. Thom. ap. Fox hist. ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. lib. 4.</note> who in his Book of the Miracles of S. <hi>Thomas of Canterbury,</hi> tells
us a story of one <hi>Eilward,</hi> a poor mean fellow of <hi>Kingsweston</hi> in <hi>Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
who being in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second condemned of
Theft (he had it seems stoln a pair of Countrey Gloves and a Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone)
was punished by losing his Eyes and Privities; who coming with
devotion to S. <hi>Thomas</hi> his Tomb, got an intire restitution of his disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
Members and Faculties, and was as good a man as ever he was.
Perchance in this he is no witness of infallible credit. Let the story of
<hi>Iphis</hi> and <hi>Ianthis,</hi> and that of <hi>Ceneus</hi> try Masteries with this for the Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone;
to our purpose the Writer is trusty enough. But in the first

of Theft. <q>Let it be lawful for the Abbot of that Church, if he chance
to come in in the God speed, to acquit an High-way-man or Thief

               <p>31. <q>Against Cheats, whom they commonly call Coyners ('tis

no cheating fellow to escape scot-free, without losing his Fist or
Hand, who had been understood to have put tricks upon silly people
with the traffick of their falshood.</q> For all that, he who hath tackt a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement

                  <note place="margin">Guli. Geme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. de ducib. Norm. lib. 7. cap. 23.</note> and <hi>William Gemeticensis</hi> give out,
that the Counterfeiters and Imbasers of Coin had, over and above those
parts cut off, which <hi>Galen</hi> accounts to be the principal instruments for
propagating of the kind. To whom <hi>Hoveden</hi> agrees, who writes in the

                     <hi>ANselm</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> labours earnestly with the
Pope and his party, and at length obtains it with much ado, that
from that time forward (you have it in <hi>Florilegus</hi> after other Writers)
never any one should be invested with a Pastoral Staff or a Ring into a
Bishoprick or Abbacy by the King, or any Lay-person whatsoever in
<hi>England,</hi> (added out of <hi>Malmesbury</hi>) retaining however the priviledge
of Election and Regality.</q> There was a sharp bickering about this
business betwixt the King and <hi>Anselm;</hi> and so between the Popes <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalis</hi>
and <hi>Calixtus</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> about that time Emperour. Both of them
at least pretendedly quit their right; our King humouring the Scene
according to the present occasion. <q>For after <hi>Anselm</hi>'s death, he did
invest <hi>Rodulphus</hi> that came in his room by a Ring and a Pastoral
Staff.</q>
               </p>
               <p>36. He restored the Night-Torches or Lights which <hi>William</hi> the

               <p>37. To make up a portion for <hi>Mawd</hi> the Kings Daughter, married
to <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperour, every <hi>Hide</hi> of Land paid a Tribute of Three
Shillings. Here <hi>Polydore</hi> makes his descant. <q>Afterward, sayes he,
The rest of the Kings followed that course of raising Portions for the
bestowal of their Daughters; so tenacious hath posterity alway been
of their own advantages.</q> It is scarce to be doubted, that the right of
raising money for the marrying of the Lords Daughters by way of <hi>Aid</hi>
or Subsidy upon the Tenants or Dependants, is of a more ancient ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.
Neither would I fetch it from the mutual engagement of <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
his Patrons and Clients, or Landlords and Tenants, or from <hi>Suetonius</hi>
his <hi>Caligula:</hi> rather from the old Customs of the <hi>Normans,</hi> more ancient
than King <hi>Henry;</hi> where that threefold Tribute is explained by the
name of <hi>Aid,</hi> which the Patent granted by King <hi>John</hi> in favour of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
liberty mentions in these words: <q>I will impose no Escuage or Aid
in our Realm, but by the common advice of our Realm; unless it be to
ransom our Body, and to make our first-born Son a Soldier or Knight,
and to marry our eldest Daughter once.</q>
               </p>

at this time our Lawyers (and that the more modern Law of <hi>Edward</hi>

<hi>Henry.</hi> And they reckon it too among the most ancient Customs of the
Kingdom.<note place="margin">Pat. 46 lid. 3.</note> Did therefore King <hi>Richard</hi> order, or did <hi>Hoveden</hi> relate
this to no purpose, or without any need? <q>If one who suffers shipwrack

what he left, according as they can shew and make out that they are
his next heirs. Or if the deceased have neither Sons nor Daughters,
nor Brothers nor Sisters, the King is to have his Chattels.</q> Can one
imagine, that this Law he made at <hi>Messina,</hi> when he was engaged in
War, was calculated only for that time or place? Certainly in the

They are things of custom to which he swore, and such as whereby for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

some things there are, that may be worth the transcribing.</p>
               <p>41. <q>Castles were frequently raised ('tis <hi>Nubrigensis</hi> relates it) in

in a manner as many Kings, or rather as many Tyrants, as Lords
of Castles, having severally the stamping of their own Coin, and a
power of giving Law to the Subjects after a Royal manner.</q> then was
the Kingdom plainly torn to pieces, and the right of Majesty shattered,
which gains to it self not the least lustre from stamping of Money.
Though I know very well,<note place="margin">V. Leg. Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan. 14.</note> that before the <hi>Normans,</hi> in the City of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,

out of the Pontificial Law, that that <hi>Excommunication,</hi> they call

him to be present at Divine Offices, and the use of the Sacraments.)
<q>I say he ought not to be Excommunicated, before that the Kings Chief
Justice of that Village or City be spoken with, that he may order him
to come to satisfaction: And if the Kings Justice fail therein, he shall
be at the Kings mercy, and thereupon or after that the Bishop may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish

               <p>TO the Laws of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> which I spoke of, the States of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
(the <hi>Baronage</hi>) and with them the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
took their Oaths in solemn manner, calling upon God. There were
Embassadors sent to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, that there might be that
bottom also, that he would further confirm and ratifie them. But he
was so far from doing that, that he did not only pretend that they did
too much derogate from the priviledge of the Clergy, and wholly refuse
to give his assent to them; but also having absolved <hi>Thomas</hi> the Arch-Bishop,
at his own request, from the obligation of that Oath he had
bound himself with, he condemned them as impious, and such as made
against the interest and honour of holy Church. King <hi>Henry,</hi> as soon as
he heard of it, took it, as it was fit he should, very much in dudgeon;
grievously and most deservedly storming at the insolence of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Court, and the Treachery of the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Immediately
Letters were dispatcht to the several Sheriffs of the respective Counties,
<q>That if any Clerk or Layman in their Bayliwicks, should appeal to the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> they should seise him and take him into firm custody;
till the King give order what his pleasure is: And that they should seise
into the Kings hand, and for his use, all the Revenues and Possessions of
the Arch-Bishops Clerks; and of all the Clerks that are with the Arch-Bishop;
they should put by way of safe pledge the Fathers, Mothers,
and Sisters, Nephews and Neeces, and their Chattels, till the King
give order what his pleasure is.</q> I have told the Story out of <hi>Matthew
Paris.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Here let me say a little concerning the Tryal by Fire and Water, or the
<hi>Ordeals.</hi> It is granted, that these were the <hi>Saxons</hi> wayes of tryal,
rashly and unadvisedly grounded upon Divine Miracle. They do more
appertain to Sacred Rites, than to Civil Customs; for which reason we
past them by in the former Book, and this place seemed not unseasonable
to put the Reader in mind of them. <q>He who is accused, is bound to
clear himself ('tis <hi>Ralph Glanvill</hi> writes this) by the Judgement of
God,<note place="margin">Glanv. l. 14. c. 1.</note> to wit, by hot burning Iron, or by Water, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
condition of men: by burning hot Iron, if it be a free-man; by
Water,<note place="margin">Polydor. hist. l. 8. Matth. Park. in vit. Rob. Archiep. Cant.</note> if he be a Countrey-man or Villain.</q> The party accused did
carry in his hand a piece of Iron glowing hot, going for the most part
two or three steps or paces along, or else with the soles of his feet did
walk upon red hot Plough-shares or Coulters, and those, according to
the Laws of the <hi>Franks</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> nine in number. The Lady
<hi>Emme</hi> the <hi>Confessor</hi>'s Mother being impeached of Adultery with <hi>Aldwin</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Winton,</hi> was wonderfully cleared by treading upon so many,
and is famous for it in our Histories, being preserved safe from burning,
and proved innocent from the Crime.</p>
               <p>There were two sorts of watery <hi>Ordeal</hi> or tryal by Water; to wit, cold
or scalding hot. The party was thrown into the cold water, as in some
places at this day Witches are used: he who did not by little and little
sink to the bottom, was condemned as guilty of the Crime, as one whom
that Element, which is the outward sign in the Sacrament of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
did not admit into its bosome. As to scalding Water, ones arm
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108530:60"/>
in that manner thrust in up to the elbow, made a discovery of the truth;
and <hi>Aelstan</hi> a Monk of <hi>Abendon,</hi> afterward Bishop of <hi>Shirburn,</hi> thrusting in
his bare Hand into a boiling Cauldron, shewed himself with some pride
to his Abbot.</p>

or by the Sanction and <hi>Authority</hi> of Law-givers. Of ancient time the

               <p>The <hi>Kings</hi> were neither Monarchs of the whole Island, nor so much

<hi>Cyngetorix, Carvilius, Taximagulus,</hi> and <hi>Segonax;</hi> and at the same rate in
other Counties. Wherefore we have no reason to make any question,
but that part wherein we live, now called <hi>England,</hi> was governed by
several persons, and was subject to an Aristocracy: according to what

               <p>They who deny there were any <hi>Chancellors</hi> before the coming in of the
<hi>Normans,</hi> are hugely mistaken. Nor are they disproved only out of the
Grant of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor</hi> to the Abbot of <hi>Westminster,</hi> which I am
beholden to Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi> for, at the bottom of which these words are
set down: <hi>I</hi> Syward <hi>Publick Notary, instead of</hi> Rembald <hi>the Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties</hi>
Chancellor, <hi>have written and subscribed this paper;</hi> but also out of
<hi>Ingulph,</hi> who makes mention of <hi>Turketulus,</hi> some while after that Abbot
of <hi>Crowland,</hi> Chancellor of King <hi>Edred,</hi> 
                  <q>by whose Decree and Counsel
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108530:66"/>
were to be handled &amp; treated whatsoever businesses they were, Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
or Spiritual, that did await the Judgement of the King; and being thus
treated of by him,<note place="margin">Fr. Thin. in contin. Chr. Eliz.</note> might irrefragably stand good.</q> And <hi>Francis Thinn,</hi>
that Learned Antiquary has reckoned up several, who have discharged
this Office; as <hi>Turketill</hi> to King <hi>Ethelbald, Swithin</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
to King <hi>Egbert, Vlfin</hi> to King <hi>Athelstan, Adulph</hi> to King <hi>Edgar, Alsy</hi>
Abbot and Prelate of <hi>Ely</hi> to King <hi>Ethelred.</hi> Concerning which Office
and the Seals, which the <hi>Chancellor</hi> in old time had the keeping of, I had
rather you would consult with <hi>Camden</hi>'s Tribunals or Seats of Justice,
and those things which <hi>John Budden</hi> at <hi>Wainfleet</hi> Doctor of Laws has
brought out of the <hi>Archives</hi> into his <hi>Palingenesia,</hi> than seek them at my

               <p>As for <hi>Treasurers,</hi>

               <p>But that fifth title of <hi>Alderman of England,</hi> is an unusual one. Yet, if
I don't mistake my self, he was the Chief President in Tryals at Law,
and an Officer to keep all quiet at home; the same as now perhaps is
commonly called the <hi>Lord Chief Justice of England.</hi> This remarkable
name I do not meet with, neither in the Monkish <hi>Chronologers,</hi> which
are to be had at the Shops,<note place="margin">Camden.</note> nor in the <hi>Records</hi> of our Laws. But a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

               <p>
                  <hi>Aldermen</hi> may aptly be termed by the word <hi>Senators.</hi> Those Judges
did exercise a delegated power throughout the Provinces, called <hi>Counties</hi>
or <hi>Shires,</hi> and the <hi>Graves</hi> and under-delegated power from them. The
word is as much as Governours, and is the same thing, as in High
Dutch <hi>Grave</hi> in <hi>Landgrave, Burgrave, Palsgrave,</hi> &amp;c. and what
amongst some of our own people <hi>Reev.</hi> We shall call them both, as
that Age did, in a <hi>Latin</hi> term, the one <hi>Comites, i. e.</hi> Counts or Earls, the
other <hi>Vicecomites,</hi> that is, Viscounts or Sheriffs.</p>
               <p>The name of <hi>Count</hi> is every where met with amongst the most ancient
of the Monks, which yet does very often pass into that of <hi>Duke</hi> in the
subscription of Witnesses. And in the Charter of the Foundation of
<hi>Chertsey</hi> Abby in <hi>Surrey,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Viscount</hi> and a Vice-Lord are more than very like, they are the very
same. <hi>Ingulph</hi> sayes it above. <q>And in the last hand-writing of King
<hi>Edred</hi> we have, I <hi>Bingulph</hi> Vice-Lord advised it, I <hi>Alfer</hi> Viscount

These <hi>Counts</hi> and <hi>Viscounts,</hi> or <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Sheriffs</hi> had in their Counties
their several <hi>Courts</hi> both for private and for publick matters. For pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

King <hi>Edgar</hi> ordered the <hi>Court of Inquests</hi> or Inquiries, called <hi>Tourn

                  <q>Let a Convention or Meeting be held twice every year
out of every County, at which let the Bishop of that Diocess, and the
Senator, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Alderman) be present; the one to teach the people
the Laws of God; the other the Laws of the Land.</q> What I have set
down in <hi>William</hi> the First at the end of the fourth Chapter of this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Book, you ought to consider of here again in this place.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants did not meet at this <hi>Court of Inquests</hi> at any season
promiscuously and indifferently, but as it is very well known by the use
and ancient Constitutions of the Realm, within a Month either after
<hi>Easter,</hi> or after <hi>Michaelmas.</hi> In which Court, seeing that not only
the <hi>Count,</hi> as now a dayes the <hi>Viscount</hi> or <hi>Sheriff</hi> does, but also the
<hi>Bishop</hi> did preside; it does not at all seem difficult to trace the very ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of this temporary Law.<note place="margin">Synod. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och. c. 20.</note> That peradventure was the Synod of
<hi>Antioch</hi> held in Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the First's time, and acknowledged in the
sixth General Council held at <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dist 18. c. 4.</note> In this latter there are
expresly and plainly two Councils or Meetings of the Bishops to be kept
every year within three Weeks after <hi>Easter,</hi> and about the middle of
<hi>October,</hi> (if there be any small difference in the time, it can be no great
matter of mistake). You may help your self to more other things of
meaner note out of what has been said before about <hi>Hundreds, Bourghs</hi>
and the like.</p>
               <p>And this may serve in brief for the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who were entrusted with
the care of their Laws.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Norman Earls. Their Fee. Their power of making Laws.
Of the Barons, i.e. Lords of Manours. Of the Court-Baron.
Its rise. An instance of it out of Hoveden. Other Offices much
alike with the Saxons.</head>
               <p>I Shall be briefer concerning the <hi>Normans,</hi> I mean their <hi>Earls</hi> and
<hi>Barons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their <hi>Counts</hi> or <hi>Earls</hi> before the Conquest, except those of <hi>Leicester,</hi>
and perchance some others, were but Officers, and not as yet heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
When <hi>William</hi> bore the sway, they began to have a certain Fee and a
descent of Patrimony; having together with their Title assigned to them
a third part of the Revenues or Rents, which did arise out of the whole
County to the Exchequer. This custom is clear enough in <hi>Gervase</hi> of
<hi>Tilbury</hi> in the case of <hi>Richard de Red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>eriis</hi> made Earl of <hi>Devonshire</hi> by
<hi>Henry</hi> the First, &amp; <hi>Jeoffrey de Magna Villa</hi> made Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> by <hi>Mawd</hi> the
Empress. It seems that the <hi>Saxon</hi> Earls had the self-same right of sharing
with the King. So in <hi>Doomsday</hi> Book we find it; <q>The Queen <hi>Edeua</hi> had
two parts from <hi>Ipswich</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and the Earl or Count <hi>Guert</hi> the third:
and so of <hi>Norwich,</hi> that it paid Twenty Pound to the King, and to the
Earl Ten Pound: so of the Revenues of the Borough of <hi>Lewes</hi> in
<hi>Sussex,</hi> the King had two shares, and the Earl the third. And <hi>Oxford</hi>
paid for Toll and Gable, and other customary Duties Twenty Pound
a year to the King, besides Six Quarts of Honey, and to Earl <hi>Algar</hi>
Ten Pound.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, it appears also that these <hi>Norman</hi> Earls or Counts had
some power of making Laws to the people of their Counties. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
the Monk of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Malmesb. de gest. reg. l. 3.</note> 
                  <q>that the Laws of <hi>William Fitz-Osborn</hi>
Earl of <hi>Hereford</hi> remained still in force in the said County, that
no Souldier for whatsoever offence should pay above Seven Shillings.</q>
The Writings and Patents of the men of <hi>Cornwall</hi> concerning their Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
or Tinn-Mines do prove as much; nor need I tell the story, how
<hi>Godiva</hi> Lady to the Earl <hi>Leofrick</hi> rid on Horse-back through the Streets of
<hi>Coventry</hi> with her hair disshevelled, all hanging about her at full length,
that by this means she might discharge them of those Taxes and Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which the Earl had imposed upon them.</p>
               <p>Out of the Countreys (wherein all Estates were subject to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Service) the <hi>Barons</hi> had their Territories, as we call them
<hi>Mannors;</hi> and in them their Courts to call their Tenants together, at
the end of every three Weeks, and to hear and determine their Causes.
A Civilian,<note place="margin">Ad leg. 2. de origin. jur.</note> one <hi>Vdalricus Zazius,</hi> would have the original of these
Courts among other Nations, to have come by way of imitation from
<hi>Romulus</hi> his making of Lords or Patrons, and their Clanns or Tenants.
The use of them at this day is common and ordinarily known. But to
shew how it was of old, we will borrow out of <hi>Hoveden</hi> this spark of
light.<note place="margin">Roger de Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veden in H. 2.</note> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>John Marshall</hi> complained to <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, that whereas
he had claimed or challenged in the Arch-Bishops Court a piece of Land
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108530:67"/>
to be held from him by right of inheritance, and had a long time
pleaded upon it, he could obtain no Justice in the case, and that he had
by Oath falsified the Arch-Bishops Court, (that is, proved it to be false
by Oath, according to the custom of the Realm: to whom the Arch-Bishop
made answer, There has been no Justice wanting to <hi>John</hi> in my
Court; but he, I know not by whose advice, or whether of his own
head, brought in my Court a certain <hi>Toper,</hi> and swore upon it, that
he went away from my Court for default of Justice; and it seemed to
the Justices of my Court, that he did me the injury, by withdrawing
in that manner from my Court; seeing it is ordained in your Realm, that
he who would falsifie anothers Court must swear upon the holy Gospels.
The King not regarding these words, swore, that he would have Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Judgement of him; and the Barons of the Kings Court did
judge him to be in the Kings Mercy; and moreover they fined him
Five Hundred Pound.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to doing Justice in all other Cases, and managing of Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
the <hi>Normans</hi> had almost the same Names and Titles of Officers and

here may seem somewhat obscure; Wheresore I think fit to
set down this by way of explication. He sayes, that the Letters which

as the <hi>Greeks</hi> borrowed from the <hi>Gauls</hi> than what they had originally of
their own. This he proves in the end of this Paragraph by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of several Learned Men. So then, if this were so, <hi>Caesar,</hi> who
without all question was well enough acquainted with the <hi>Greek Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
then in use, yet in all likelihood did not so well know what the
true odl <hi>Gallick Letters</hi> were, the people being strangers to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
and he having but lately had any converse with them, and so might
very probably mistake, in thinking that, because the Letters were the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:108530:72"/>
same, the <hi>Gauls</hi> might borrow the <hi>Greek</hi> Letters to make use of; whereas
the contrary (to wit, that the <hi>Greeks,</hi> after the disuse of the <hi>Phoenician</hi>

                  <p>Pag. 28. lin. 11. <hi>Now you for your part are Gods Vicegerent in the
Kingdom.</hi>] They are the words of Pope <hi>Eleutherius</hi> in his Letter to
<hi>Lucy,</hi> the first Christian King, which was in the year of our Lord 183.
From whence we may fairly conclude, that in those early dayes, the
<hi>Pope of Rome</hi> according to his own acknowledgement had no such
pretensions as now for several Ages since they have made, upon the
Rights of Princes, to the great disturbance of the World, and reproach
of Christian Religion. And indeed this is the more considerable, in
that such was the simplicity of devotion in those early Converts, and
such the deference, which Princes who embraced the Christian Faith,
especially from the Missionaries of <hi>Rome,</hi> had for that <hi>Holy See,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by this one single instance; that it had been no hard matter, nor
could be judged an unreasonable thing, for them to lay claim to a right,
and assert a power, which was so voluntarily offered. Further I add,
that seeing the <hi>Donation of Constantine,</hi> besides that it was alwayes look't
upon as a piece of forgery, was at best, supposing it true, but an Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Grant and Concession, which would not be of authority enough to
bear up the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi> in all other Kingdoms of the earth; and
seeing Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> who was the first that with bare face own'd it,
his complyance with <hi>Phocas</hi> was so grosly wicked, that none of their
own Writers but are ashamed to make that transaction betwixt those
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:108530:73"/>
two, an argument for the Papal pretence: Seeing, I say, it is so,
if the Pope be intitled, as their <hi>Canonists</hi> pretend, to an Universal
Dominion by vertue of his Office, and by Commission from <hi>Christ</hi>
and his chief Apostle S. <hi>Peter,</hi> how came it to pass, that the Bishops of
<hi>Rome</hi> all along till <hi>Boniface,</hi> were so modest, as not to challenge any
such rights or powers; nay, upon occasion to declare against such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
as <hi>Antichristian;</hi> which, if that be true, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is by his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and by a Divine Commission instated into a <hi>Supremacy,</hi> was in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
no less, than to betray the cause of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Church:</hi> how came
it to pass, that <hi>Eleutherius</hi> should neglect such a seasonable and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
opportunity of maintaining and exercising his right, and should
rather chuse to return it in a complement back to the King his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert?
<hi>VICARIVS verÃ² DEI estis in Regno,</hi> sayes he, <hi>You are
GOD</hi>'s <hi>VICAR in your Kingdom:</hi> which Title now the <hi>Pope</hi> doth
with as much arrogance challenge to himself, as here one of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors

<hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws, when any one came to take upon him the Government
of a <hi>Wapentake,</hi> upon a day appointed all that owed suit and service
to that Hundred, came to meet their new Governour at the usual place
of their Rendezvouz. He upon his arrival, lighting off his Horse, set up
his Lance an end (a Custom used also among the <hi>Romans</hi> by the <hi>Prator</hi> at
the meetings of the <hi>Centumviri</hi>) and according to custom took fealty
of them. The Ceremony of which was, that all who were present,
touch't the Governours Lance with their Lances, in token of a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
whereupon that whole meeting was called a <hi>Wapentake,</hi>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:108530:74"/>

Others will have it from <hi>tac</hi> to take, and give this account
of it, that the Lord of the Hundred at his first entrance upon the place
was used to take the Tenants Arms, surrendred and delivered up to
him by themselves, in token of subjection by way of Homage. Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas

meeting, there was a Muster taken of their Weapons or Arms; and
that those who could not find sufficient Pledges for their good abear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
had their Weapons taken away; so that in his sense a <hi>Wapentake</hi>

There is little certainty what their Offices or Priviledges were, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

that inferiour Tenure they had mediately from the King by his great
Lords; which seems the more likely, because these <hi>greater Vavasors,</hi>

marriage, a <hi>Portion:</hi> but for that which the Woman hath left her by
her Husband at his death, a <hi>Dowry.</hi> And <hi>Maritagium</hi> is that which is
given to a Man with his Wife, so that 'tis the same as <hi>Dos</hi> among the
<hi>Romans,</hi> saith <hi>Spelman.</hi> But that is too general, I think, that the man
should be obliged to return at his death <hi>all</hi> to his Wife that he had with
her, beside leaving her a Dowry. I am therefore rather inclined to
<hi>Cowell,</hi> who tells us, <hi>Maritagium</hi> signifies <hi>Land</hi> bestowed in marriage;
which, it seems, by this Law was to return to the Wife, if her Husband
dyed before her. The word hath another sense also, which doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to this place, being sometime taken for that which Wards were
to pay to the Lord for his leave and consent that they might marry
themselves, which if they did against his consent, it was called <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
of marriage.</hi>

                  <p>Lin. 35. <hi>The common Duty of Money or Coinage.</hi>] So I render the
word <hi>Monetagium.</hi> For it appears, that in ancient times the Kings of
<hi>England</hi> had Mints in most of the Countreys and Cities of this Realm.
See <hi>Cowell</hi> in the word <hi>Moniers.</hi> For which priviledge, 'tis likely, they
paid some duty to the chief place of the Mint. Thus in <hi>Doomesday</hi> we
read, as <hi>Spelman</hi> quotes it, that in the City <hi>Winecestre</hi> every Monyer
paid twenty shillings to <hi>London;</hi> and the reason given, <hi>pro cuneis mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netae
accipiendis,</hi> for having Stamps or Coins of Money. For from this
<hi>Latin</hi> word <hi>Cuneus</hi> (which our Lawyers have turned into <hi>Cuna,</hi> from
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:108530:77"/>
whence the Verb <hi>Cunaere</hi>) comes our <hi>English</hi> word <hi>Coyn.</hi> Now it is
more than probable, that the Officers of the Chief Mint might by their

See <hi>Cowell</hi> in the word <hi>Gage.</hi> This in <hi>Latin</hi> is called <hi>Vadium,</hi> a pawn

the Party aggriev'd. Now there were three sorts of this <hi>Amende,</hi> the
Greater which was like a full Forfeiture, the Mid-one at reasonable terms,

that is, a Coat of Mail, when a Vassal holds Land of the Lord on
this condition, that when he is called, he be ready to attend his Lord
with a Coat of Mail or compleat Armour on. Now <hi>Haubert,</hi> as <hi>Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
tells us, properly signifies a High Lord or Baron, from <hi>Haut</hi> or
<hi>hault,</hi> high, and <hi>Ber</hi> (the same as <hi>Baro</hi>) a Man or Baron. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these great Lords were obliged by their place and service to wait
upon the King in his Wars on Horse-back with compleat Armour, and
particularly with a Coat of Mail on: hence it came, sayes he, that the
Coat of Mail it self was also called <hi>Haubert;</hi> though he doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
acknowledge that the word is extended to all other Vassals, who
are under that kind of Tenure. But then at last he inclines to think,
that the true ancient writing of the word is <hi>Hauberk</hi> (not <hi>Haubert</hi>)
as it were Hautberg, <hi>i. e.</hi> the chief or principal piece of Armour; and
<hi>Berg</hi> he will have to signifie Armour, as he makes out in some of its
compounds, <hi>Bainberg</hi> Armour for the Legs and <hi>Halsberg</hi> Armour for
the Neck and Breast: and derives it from the <hi>Saxon <hi>Beorgan,</hi> i. e.</hi> to
arm, to defend. Add to this, saith he, that the French themselves (and
we from them) call it an <hi>Haubergeon,</hi> as it were <hi>Haubergium.</hi>

Tribute or Tax, an Amercement, a payment of money, and money it
self: whence I doubt not, but the best sort of money was called <hi>Gold.</hi>
It is from the Verb <hi>geldan</hi> or <hi>gyldan,</hi> to pay. In <hi>Latin</hi> it is <hi>Geldum,</hi>
and not <hi>Gilda,</hi> as <hi>Cowell</hi> writes it. For this signifies quite another thing,
a Fraternity or Company of Merchants or the like. Whence a <hi>Gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi>
that is the Hall of the Gild or Society: such as was once the

Messuage or Manour-house, which the old <hi>Saxons</hi> called <hi>hidelandes,</hi>

Park belonging to some great House. Now as to the quantity, how
much a <hi>Hide <hi>of land</hi>
                     </hi> is, it is not well agreed. Some reckon it an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Acres, others thereabouts, by making it contain four Yardlands,
every Yardland consisting of twenty four Acres. The general opinion
is, that it was as much as could be ploughed with one Plow in a year,
<hi>terra unius aratri culturae sufficiens.</hi> And thus it should be muchwhat
the same as <hi>Carrucata terrae, i. e.</hi> a Plough-land. From <hi>Bede,</hi> who trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates

weigh'd eight ounces, and as <hi>Cowell</hi> states it out of <hi>Stow,</hi> it came to the
value of 16 <hi>l. 13 s. 4 d.</hi> At this rate three hundred Marks of Gold come
to five thousand Pound; and to every Bishop five Marks, supposing only
ten Bishops, come to 833 <hi>l. 6 s. 8 d.</hi> which is a very unlikely summ in
this business. 'Tis true, the value of it, as of other Coyns and summs,
might vary. And so we find in <hi>Spelman,</hi> that an uncertain Author
reckons a <hi>Mark of Gold</hi> to be worth fifty Marks of Silver. But then
'tis as uncertain, what <hi>Marks of Silver</hi> he means. For if they be such
as ours are (and as they were in King <hi>John</hi>'s time) at 13 <hi>s. 4 d.</hi> then a
Mark of Gold will be of the value of 33 <hi>l. 6 s. 8 d.</hi> which is just dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the former value of 16 <hi>l. 13 s. 4 d.</hi> (which being resolved into
Marks of Silver, makes but 25.) But in ancient times a <hi>Mark of Silver</hi>
was only 2 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> so that fifty of them will make but 6 <hi>l. 5 s.</hi> Another
instance we meet with, where one <hi>Mark of Gold</hi> is accounted equivalent
to ten <hi>Marks of Silver;</hi> which taking a <hi>Mark</hi> for 13 <hi>s. 4 d.</hi> comes to
6 <hi>l. 13 s. 4 d.</hi> Another, where nine Marks of Silver pass for one Mark
of Gold, in a payment to the King: which is just six pound. And these
<hi>three</hi> last accounts agree pretty well together. Taking the middlemost
of the three, <hi>viz.</hi> a Mark of Gold at ten Marks of Silver; thus the above
named summ of three hundred <hi>Marks of Gold,</hi> that is, three thousand
<hi>Marks of Silver</hi> amounts to two thousand Pound; and the five <hi>Marks</hi>
to every Bishop (supposing but ten Bishops) come to 333 <hi>l. 6 s. 8 d.</hi>
But if we take these <hi>Marks of Silver</hi> at 2 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> the account will grow
much less. For ten such <hi>Marks</hi> are but 1 <hi>l. 5 s.</hi> so that the three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>Marks of Gold</hi> at this rate will come but to 375 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling. But that
these <hi>Marks</hi> of the ancient and lower estimate are not here intended,
may probably enough be gathered from one passage more we find there,
<hi>Centum solidi dentur vel marca auri,</hi> where, if <hi>solidi</hi> stand for shillings
(for they may be taken for <hi>soulx</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> call them) a <hi>Mark of
Gold</hi> is made of equal value with 5 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling. And thus three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

clear account given by <hi>Spelman</hi> (in the word <hi>Romascot</hi>) that it was

he went on Pilgrimage to <hi>Rome, Adrian</hi> the First then Pope,

20. <hi>libratae terrae.</hi> For although <hi>Cowell</hi> in proportion to <hi>Quadrantata,</hi> or
Fardingdeal of Land, which he saith is the fourth part of an Acre, seems
at first to gather that <hi>Obolata</hi> then must be half an Acre, <hi>Denariata</hi> a
whole Acre, and by consequence <hi>Solidata</hi> twelve Acres, and <hi>Librata</hi>
twenty times twelve, that is, two hundred and forty Acres: Yet this
was but a conceit of his own. For by having found the word used
with reference to Rent as well as Land, thus 20. <hi>libratas terrae
vel reditÃ»s,</hi> he is forced to acknowledge, that it must signifie so much
Land as may yield twenty shillings <hi>per annum.</hi> To which opinion <hi>Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
also gives his assent. But what quantity of Land this <hi>Librata terrae</hi>
is, cannot so easily be determined. <hi>Cowell</hi> out of <hi>Skene</hi> tells us, it
contains four Oxgangs, and every Oxgang thirteen Acres: if so, then
it is fifty two Acres, and twenty of them, which make a Knights
fee, come to one thousand and forty Acres, which somewhat exceeds
the account here set down of six hundred and eighty out of the Red
Book of the Exchequer. But there is a great deal of more difference
still, as the account of the <hi>Knights fÃ©e</hi> is given by others. In one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript
we read, that <hi>A Yardland contains twenty four Acres, four Yard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
make one Hide,</hi> (that is, ninety six Acres), <hi>and five Hides make a
Knights fee,</hi> (that is, four hundred and eighty Acres) <hi>the Relief
whereof is a hundred Shillings.</hi> Another Manuscript hath it thus, <hi>Ten
Acres according to ancient custom make one Fardel, and four Fardels</hi> (that
is, forty Acres) <hi>make a Yardland, and four Yardlands</hi> (that is, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and sixty Acres) <hi>make one Hide, and four Hides</hi> (that is, six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:108530:81"/>
and forty Acres) <hi>make one Knights fee.</hi> A third reckons it otherwise,
that <hi>sixteen Yard-lands make a whole Knights fee;</hi> which if we make a Yard-land
to be twenty four Acres (according to the first account) comes
to three hundred eighty four Acres; but if (according to the second)
we take it for forty Acres, it amounts to six hundred and forty Acres.
<hi>And,</hi> saith he, <hi>when they are taxed at six Shillings four Pence</hi> (that is,
every of the sixteen Yard-lands, which make up the Fee, at so much)
<hi>they make the summ of one hundred Shillings</hi> (or five Pound, which was
the ancient Relief of a Knights fee.) But this is a mistake either of
the Author or the Citation; it is six Shillings three Pence, which makes
that just summ; from whence we learn also what proportion was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by the Lord in setting and demanding of the Relief upon the
next Heir after his Ancestor's decease. Further in the Kings Writ, as <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>
cites it, it is said, that twelve Plough-lands make one Knights fee:
which, allowing to a Plough-land one hundred &amp; twenty Acres, amounts
to one thousand four hundred and forty Acres. In the main, as to the
value of a Knights fee, 'tis enough what <hi>Cowell</hi> tells us, that it was so
much inheritance, as was sufficient yearly to maintain a Knight with
convenient Revenue, which in <hi>Henry</hi> the Thirds dayes, <hi>Camden</hi> sayes,
was fifteen Pounds, and Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> rates at forty. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the account, which our Author here gives us, we find in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
for Knights in the first of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, that such as had twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Pounds in Fee, or for term of life <hi>per annum,</hi> might be compelled to
be Knights. And as to the various measure of Land (of which we
have had a remarkable instance in this business before us) <hi>Spelman</hi> hath
given us good reasons for it; since where the Land was good, they
might probably reckon the fewer Acres to a Yard-land, a Hide, a
Knights fee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and where it was barren, they might allow the more.
Beside, that some Lords, who lett these Fees, might be more bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and profuse, others more parsimonious and severe to their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents;
and that the services which were imposed upon these Fees,
might in some Mannors according to custom be lighter, in others upon
agreement and covenant more heavy. All which might strangely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versifie
the account, as to the quantity or measure of those Lands,
which were to make up a Knights fee.</p>

whose Countrey is called <hi>Chartrain,</hi> and their chief City <hi>Chartres,</hi> about
eighteen Leagues from <hi>Paris</hi> Eastward. That Town eight Miles off,
called <hi>Dreux</hi> (in <hi>Latin Drocum</hi>) was so named from the <hi>Druids,</hi> who

                  <p>P. 94. l. 37. <hi>Of the three Estates, the King, the Lords, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi>]
There are indeed three Orders or Estates acknowledged by
true Divines and sound Lawyers in the <hi>English</hi> Government; to wit,
the <hi>Lords Spiritual,</hi> the <hi>Lords Temporal,</hi> and the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
But the fundamental mistake of our Learned Author is, that he hath
joyned those two sorts of Lords (whose very character shews them to
be of a distinct <hi>species,</hi> though as to the publick Welfare and the Kings
Service they ought to be of one and the same interest) into one Estate,
and to make up the third Estate, thought himself obliged to bring in
the <hi>King</hi> himself for one, who is Lord paramount over all the three; and
by this means <hi>ipsam Majestatem in ordinem redigere.</hi> I call this a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
mistake, as a most probable ground of Rebellion (as it was in
the Barons Wars, and in our late Civil Broils) inasmuch as if the <hi>King</hi>
make one of the three Estates, as they fancy he doth, and hath (as
they do from thence conclude he hath no more) but a <hi>co-ordinate</hi>
power with both or either of the other two Estates; that then it is
lawful for both or either of those Estates, in case of publick grievances
to quarrel the King (their co-ordinate) if he will not give way to
their redress; that is, if he will not consent to do what they would
have him to do; and upon his refusal of so doing, to raise War against
him, to sequester and murder his Loyal adherents, to destroy his Royal
Person; and finally, if he escape the hazards of Battel, when they get
him into their hands, to bring him to account for a pretended male ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration,
and the violation of a trust, which God and not the People
put into his hands; and having gone so far, that they may, if possible,
secure themselves, to put the Monarch to death, and to extirpate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
it self. This was the ground and method of our late <hi>Republican</hi>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:108530:82"/>
policy and practice. Wherein yet they did not foresee what examples
they set against themselves, supposing this Doctrine of the <hi>three Estates</hi>
in their sense to be true, and that <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> had an
equality of trust and parity of power, that the same outrage, which
the <hi>Rump-Commoners</hi> acted against the King, to the destroying of him,
and against the <hi>Lords,</hi> to the outing of them, and voting them useless
and dangerous (as to their share of Government) might one time or
other be more plausibly promoted, and more effectually put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by one or both of the other two <hi>Estates,</hi> with the help and assistance
of great numbers of the <hi>Commoners</hi> (as there ever will be in such Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
divisions) against themselves and all men whatever of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
and destructive principles. No. This false Doctrine, I hope,
will never obtain among us; and our <hi>English Government</hi> is so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
that our <hi>Lords Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal</hi> and our worthy <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners,</hi>
will find it the interest of themselves and their posterities, that
they will ever have that duty and deference to our <hi>Soveraign,</hi> as may
secure Him and Us, and discourage the designs, and defeat the attempts
of all such as wish ill to his honour and safety, or to the publick
peace. Besides, is it rational to imagine, that the <hi>King,</hi> whose abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
right by Law it is, to convene the <hi>Estates,</hi> when and where he
thinks fit, to call and dissolve <hi>Parliaments,</hi> as he pleases: in a word,
that He, in whose Name all <hi>Justice</hi> is administred, in whose Hands the

This flaw I could not but take notice of in our Great Author,
and that only with an intention to undeceive the unwary Reader, and
not to reflect upon his Memory, who though he kept along a great

<hi>Holofernes,</hi> I remember, the General of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Army, is in an <hi>Old

most proper importance of the word bears up with the <hi>Latin Senator,
i. e.</hi> Parliament-man; as the Laws of S. <hi>Edward</hi> make out. <q>In like
manner, say they, heretofore among the <hi>Britons,</hi> in the times of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> in this Kingdom of <hi>Britanny</hi> they were called <hi>Senators,</hi> who
afterwards in the times of the <hi>Saxons</hi> were called <hi>Aldermen;</hi> not so
much in respect of their Age, as by reason of their Wisdom and
Dignity, in that some of them were but young men, yet were skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the Law, and beside that, were experienced persons.</q> Now
that <hi>Alderman of England,</hi> as <hi>Ailwin</hi> here was, had to do in affairs of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:108530:82"/>
Justice, appears by the foresaid Book of <hi>Ramsey,</hi> where it is said, that
<hi>Ailwin</hi> the Alderman and <hi>Aedric</hi> the Kings Provost sate Judges in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

distinguish, but at length placeth him in the middle betwixt the Count
and Viscount. He and the Bishop kept Court together, the one for
Temporals, the other for Spirituals. The Title goes lower still, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
a Mayor or Bailiff of a Corporation, a Bailiff of a Hundred, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Lin. 30. <hi>Healf-koning.</hi>] It was an oversight or slip of memory in
our Author, to say, that <hi>Ailwin</hi> was so called; when the Book of
<hi>Ramsey</hi> tells us, it was his Father <hi>Aethelstan,</hi> who was of that great
power and diligence, that all the business of the Kingdom went through
his hands, and was managed as he pleased, that had that Nick name
given him therefore.</p>
                  <p>Lin. 36. <hi>The <hi>Graves.</hi>
                     </hi>] Our Author makes them subordinate to the
<hi>Aldermen</hi> of Counties: but in the Laws of the <hi>Confessor</hi> they appear
to be muchwhat the same. There we read, <q>And as they are now
called <hi>Greves,</hi> who are put in places of Rule over others, so they
were anciently among the <hi>English</hi> called <hi>Ealdermen.</hi>
                     </q> Indeed, the
word <hi>Greve</hi> or <hi>Reev</hi> (for it is all one) is of as various use, as that
other of <hi>Alderman</hi> is. In <hi>Saxon</hi> it is <hi>gerefa,</hi> from <hi>gerefen</hi> and <hi>reafen,</hi>
to take or carry away, to exact or gather. Whence this Officer
(<hi>Graphio</hi> or <hi>Gravius</hi> from the <hi>Saxon</hi>) is in other <hi>Latin</hi> called <hi>Exactor
regius;</hi> and by reason that the <hi>Sheriff</hi> gathered the Kings Fines and
other Duties, and returned them to the Exchequer, he was called the
<hi>Shire-greve</hi> or <hi>Shire-reev,</hi> that is, the Gatherer of the County. But
the truth is, that <hi>Greve</hi> or <hi>Reev</hi> came at last in general to signifie any
Ruler or Governour set over any place almost whatever; as the same
word Grave doth among the <hi>Dutch.</hi> So a <hi>Shire-greve,</hi> or <hi>bihgerefa,</hi>
the High Sheriff of a County; a <hi>Port-greve,</hi> the Governour of a City

or <hi>gafel,</hi> signifies any Impost upon Goods; as that in <hi>France,</hi> upon
Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> also Tribute, Custom, any kind of Tax or Payment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Lin. 32. <hi>Through the Streets of</hi> Coventry.] There is a famous Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
among the people of that Town concerning this matter, that
the Lady being to ride naked, only covered all over with her hair,
had given order for the more decent performance of her Procession,
that all the Inhabitants should that day keep their Shops and Doors
and Windows shut. But that two men tempted by their Curiosity
to do what fools are wont to do, had some such penalty, I know not
what it was, inflicted upon them, as <hi>Actaon</hi> had for the like offence.

And they now stand in some publick place cut out of Wood or Stone,
to be shewn to any stranger that comes thither, like the Sign of the
<hi>Two Logger-heads,</hi> with the same Motto belike, <hi>Nous sommes trois.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pag. 99. lin. 7. <hi>Brought in my Court a certain <hi>Toper.</hi>
                     </hi>] In the <hi>Latin,
attulit in curiÃ¢ meÃ¢ quandam <hi>Toper.</hi>
                     </hi> I know what the adverb <hi>Toper</hi>
signifies among the ancient <hi>Latines;</hi> but what the word means here, I
confess, I am in the dark. It doth certainly stand for some thing (I
was thinking a <hi>Taper</hi>) which he brought with him into Court, and
sware upon it, as he should have done upon the holy Gospels. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
imagine, that by <hi>quandam <hi>Toper,</hi>
                     </hi> shold be intended some Woman
or Girl, whose Name was <hi>Toper,</hi> whom he brought along with him,
and in defiance to the Court, laying his hand upon her, took his Oath as
formally, as if he had done it upon the holy Evangelists.</p>

it much more convenient for thy ease and profit, to distribute them into

at the beginning; and withal, that no one may complain, that I have
injured the <hi>Author,</hi> by altering his Method, I have left his <hi>Sections</hi>
