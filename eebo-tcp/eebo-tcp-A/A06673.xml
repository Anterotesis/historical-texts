            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

This man was <hi>Adrianus,</hi> ſonne to this forenamed <hi>Perſeus,</hi> of whom wée told you in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of this hiſtory, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in his infancie he was by his wicked working Aunt ſent foorth into thoſe forreſts, with an intent to be betrayed to death: who by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural loue of a Lioneſſe, had béen al this while brought
<pb facs="tcp:20338:6"/>
vp in that deſert, ignorant what hee was, becauſe hee wanted thoſe ordinary directions to tell him the truth: but that the inſtinct of nature had perſwaded him there were other creatures, then thoſe ordinary companie wherwith he daily dwelt, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom he muſt naturally deſcend: for that he ſeeing in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon courſe of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall increaſe euery beaſt bring foorth his like, it power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perſwaded him there were comely creatures like himſelfe, though it neuer till then was his lucke to ſee them: and glad in himſelfe that hee had at laſt wonne what he long had wiſhed, he made great haſte to climbe vp the wearie way, cut off the ſide of a hill to get vp to the place where he might ſee him ſit: to whom when at laſt he came, looking ſtedfaſtly in his face, pauſing long before his ſpéech, as vnacquainted with cunning ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, wherewith commonly men curiouſly vſe to reſalute one another, gins with wilde, and yet wittie words, rudely, and yet rarely in his vnacquainted kind demand what he was, that had hit vpon that plaine, in which place in twentie long yeares (for that ſpace had he there ſpent) neuer ſaue himſelfe any ſuch creature came. To whom this curſed king, after he had through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viewed his perfect proportion, wondring that ſo beautifull a bodie, adorned with ſo pregnant a witte, ſhould ſpring from thoſe vnfurniſhed fields: for as the Diamond that obſcured in an vneuen rocke, through the thicke ſlough of many ſlimie ſhadowes ſhewes as it is what it ſhould be: Roſes through tranſparant lawne ſets out their ſwéete ſubſtance by their fayre ſhewes: piercing ſtarres though obſcured oft with the couert of ſome ouer-ſhadowing clowde, yet through thoſe ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes ſéemes no leſſe themſelues: ſo fared in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne ſtate of this yet wild man, in whoſe face was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen the characters of farre fayrer fortune, then is found in ſuch deſolate dwellings, whoſe words though
<pb facs="tcp:20338:7"/>
wanting that flattering forme wherewith other men vſe to paint their ſpeeches withall, yet with more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion did they procéede from this vntutered truant, then vſually wee ſee from many of our beſt brought vp ſchollers: for in him was the picture of a perfect man, his bodie not bolſtered with the apiſh trims of concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted attire, his mind not nuſled vp in the ſlauiſh ſhadow of vaine and fruitles folly, his tongue had not taſted of that intiſing ſtreame that tips with ſeuerall tunes the ſtate of ſundrie tongues, turning them from the mould wherein nature firſt had made them to a new forme, wherein arte wil néeds faſhion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as ſome for feare, &amp; other for falſhood to flatter: ſome for bribes with bitter words to betray, and other for folly to ſay and gainſay: ſome with fayre fawning words to vndermine their friends, and others with <hi>Synons</hi> ſubtiltie to outreach their foes: ſome with tatling tales to tell the ſureſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of their firmeſt friends, and others with euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours to deuiſe ſlanderous ſpeeches to ſpitefull ends. What ſhould we ſay on theſe ſorts that dims my mind, more with multitudes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſeueral ſtarres in a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters froſtie night dazles the eyes with their numbers, paſſes the ſands on the ſhore, the drops in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral pebles in a ſhewer of haile, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infinite abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſeueral grains ripe Autumne reapes from the earths fayre face. To bee ſhort, there was perfection of bodie without the pampering of pride, vertue of mind with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the varietie of miſleading manners, a true telling tongue that neuer taſted of a trifling tale: ſo héere was deciphered the difference betwixt the intent of nature in our firſt creation, and the euent of vſe in our education: for that the one firſt formes all things to the beſt, the other in the end frames them commonly to the worſt.</p>
            <p>Well, after theſe two had with ſuch gréetings ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:20338:7"/>
one another, as beſeemed the melancholy diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the one, and the rude bringing vp of the other, they with friendly curteſie companie together, where the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage man firſt begins earneſtly to aſke of the others eſtate: which the king fearfully fained to be but meane, and that hee hauing trod y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tract of an almoſt vnworne way, had by hard hap hit vpon that place: and being ignorant what way to eſcape, had there long lingered, as is the common vſe of ſuch diſtreſſed men, carefully conſidering with himſelf what way were beſt to work his owne releaſe from that waſt way wanting wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. To whom the ſauage man gan thus anſwer. I that know not from whence thou cameſt, am farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to direct thee whither thou ſhouldſt backe againe goe, and ſaue myſelfe liues there none here like to thée. Twentie fayre Summers flowers haue I ſéene fade in theſe fields, &amp; ſuſtained the ſtubborne brunts of as many winter blaſts, ſéene the ſeuerall ſhapes of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie beaſts, and marked their manners in their ſeueral kinds, how the ſtately Lyon proudly commands the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poore crouching creatures, and they in their kinde dutifully demeane themſelues to his ſoueraigntie: mine eares haue heard the ſeuerall ſounds of their ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie voyces, but could not diſtinguiſh them. Oft haue I ſpoke to the cruell beaſts, thinking they could ſkill of my words: but they all rudely runnes away without anſwering againe: then fearing leaſt that threatning wordes had with feare forced their flight, gan I with ſubmiſſe intreaties to craue their companies: but that as did the firſt periſhed without hope, and left me ſtill to mine ill happe, which oft vrged me to conſider with my ſelfe what my ſelfe might bee, differing in making, diſagréeing in manners, and failing of euery meanes that I made for my further inſtruction. No place is here that I haue not often ſought, to ſee of whom I
<pb facs="tcp:20338:8"/>
might iſſue: for that thus much hath nature taught me, that néedes I muſt come from a like kinde as doe all creatures els. Little I remember my ſelfe as I haue ſeene the young whelps of theſe careles creatures that poſſeſſe theſe plaines, and by the proceſſe of time am by degrées growne to this ſtate, wherein now thou ſeeſt I ſtand. And thus with a long diſcourſe gins he debate vnto him, how from his infancie to that age, he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in thoſe vnpeopled lawnes. At laſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they with much interrogatory talke had paſſed away a long ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers day, and that now the ſhadow of the ſilent night gan ſommon euery creature to their quiet reſt, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage man loath to leaue his new found companion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, to ſpend the ſolitarie night in that vncomfortable caſe, perſwades him to accompany him downe into the bottome of a declining valley, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a farre off hee ſhewed him: who for that he had marked the trueth-ſhewing tales of his former talke, and being comforted by his well-wiſhing words, not to feare the furious onſets of outragious beaſts: for that ſuch was his acquaintance amongſt the vnreaſonable rulers of that foretold for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, as that like the quiet citizen within the peacefull walles of his houſe, is in the ſtealing ſilence of the quiet night (by the watchfull meanes of a wel meriting Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate) defended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the forcible inuaſions of ill mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning enemies: ſo he in his quiet Caue ſecurely ſleepes, little fearing the furie of theſe bolde beaſts, in whoſe companie hee had alwaies conuerſed. At laſt, wonne with the words of this faire foretelling friend, the king wearie with ſolitarie ſitting there alone, and willing alſo to eaſe his head of thoſe cruell cares that ſolitarie diſcontent had clogged him withall, he willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends to the others wiſh. Theſe two trauailing thus together, at the laſt comes downe againe into the bottome of the plaine, where (for it was now almoſt
<pb facs="tcp:20338:8"/>
night) were aſſembled diuers ſortes of ſundrie wilde beaſts readie addreſſed to go ſeeke their pray: amongſt whom when they came, as doth the ſillie ſheep to their acquainted ſhepheard, gently giue him way to trauaile where euer he will: ſo fares it with theſe two, that at their pleaſure trace theſe deſerts vp and down through many daungerous darke ſhades, that ouerſpreads the hidden caues of ſundrie ſubtill deuouring beaſts. At laſt they came downe into a long valley, where out of the ſide of a rockie cliffe was naturally hewed a déep hollow Caue, into which was a conueiance of light through the clift of a rocke that ouer-roofed this houſe: where the wilde man not vſed with curious welcomes to entertaine any ſuch gueſts, gins plainly performe the duetie of a well-meaning man, telling him that his good will wiſhed him better then his power was able to performe.</p>
            <p>Not long had theſe two ſitten alone in this loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome beaſtly den, ere there comes in a bloudie mouthed Lioneſſe, bearing in her tearing teeth the quarter of a new killed Kid. This was that Lioneſſe that in the former part of this hiſtorie wee tolde you of found this young prince, deſolately forſaken in the deſert, whom ſhe in his infancie carefully brought vp, nurſing him with that milke wherewith ſhe ſhould haue ſuſtained her young ones, till the ripenes of yeares had ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened his ſtomacke, and made him now able with vſe to feede on raw fleſh with thoſe rauenous beaſts: for whoſe prouiſion this carefull nurſe had prouided that filly ſupper: who comming to her den, and finding there vnaccuſtomed companie, gins ſternly to ſtare in his face, as though ſhe ment to proſecute her angrie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and terribly teare him in péeces with her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull clawes: till when ſhe ſaw the ſauage man (that had for his better ſafegard brought him downe
<pb facs="tcp:20338:9"/>
into the depth of that dungeon) friendly imbrace him in his armes, as though thereby he ment to reſcue him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all inſuing harmes: then gins ſhe turne her frowning countenance to fawning co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion, her terrible threats to a tractable truce, kindly with her dumbe demeanour (ſuch as nature hath furniſhed theſe reaſonles crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures withall) entertaines this trauailer, licking kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his hands, which otherwiſe ſhe could not kiſſe, ſoftly touching him with her hard talens as loath to hurt him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow, whom before ſhe intended to harme. Thus with what curteſie their vnkindly cottage did affoord, doe they intertaine this their new com'd companion: who not vſed to eate ſuch vndreſſed diſhes, as their hungrie ſtomackes gently digeſted, was content that night to liue onely with looking on their kind of life, ſtil thinking to himſelf, what and how great was his own fall, that whilome being the commander of ſo many men, was now thus at the command of one ſilly beaſt. But for that neceſſities extremitie is comprehended within no bounds of ciuilitie, as alſo becauſe he feared if he ſhould againe fall into his olde frantick furie, it would alter the minds of theſe kindly vſing creatures to the execution of ſome other act: force of the one, and feare of the other, ſo brideled his boundles griefe, that perforce hee muſt needes refraine from ſheading thoſe mercie-mouing teares, which for all that he was ſcarſe able to detaine. At laſt, after the many terrors of that tedious night, gins the golden Sunne, by the forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his fierie carre, tell to the world the gladſome approach of his comming, when as <hi>Aurora</hi> gins with her ſearching ſhew enter through the cloſe crannies of that clifted rocke: at whoſe approach wakens this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage man from his vnnaturall nurſe, and gréeting his gueſt with ſuch ſalutations, as then for want of better ſerued their turnes, he leades him from thence downe
<pb facs="tcp:20338:9"/>
lower to the ſide of a faire fountaine, that iſſued from the roote of a chriſtall rocke, whoſe water cléerer then the chriſtall from whence it came, reuiues the dead ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of drooping beholders to looke vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſwift ſtreame, that with his bubling melodie (farre paſſing the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring muſickes of <hi>Aganippus</hi> wels, that waters the Arcadian meades) were able to draw the floting Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins from the watrie boſome of the ſea, to ſtand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at their muſick, as whilome they did at the well tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſtrings of ſweet <hi>Orions</hi> harpe, when from the cruel meanes of maſſacring marriners, they ſurely ſhielded him to the ſafe ſhore. There theſe two ſits them down to waſh their wearie bodies in that purifying ſpring, where the ſauage man ſtill vrging this vnfortunate King further to relate the manner of his life. At laſt, whether vrged by inward griefe, that moſt delighteth in deſpairing it ſelfe, or forced thereunto by the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of this his ſauage ſonne, gins at laſt to declare the whole ſtorie of his ill ending raigne: firſt recounting the ſurpaſſing pleaſures that are compaſſed within the Crownes of Kings: then the honour they euery day receiue from many millions of ſeruiceable ſubiects. And when hee had largely related all theſe forepaſſed pleaſures, then like <hi>AEneas,</hi> when he deſcribed to woe weeping <hi>Dido,</hi> the ſunerall flames y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had fired fayre <hi>Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> glorie, with ſad faced ſighs he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſettles him down to tell the tragick ſtorie of his owne fall. Which when this wild man had attentiuely heard, conſidering with himſelfe the great occaſion, that ſhould draw downe ſo many diſtilling teares from the eyes of ſo patient a creature, as he ſeemed to bee, gan thus anſwer his yet vnknowne father. If (quoth hee) with the vnſtable ſtormes of winde, the ſtrong Cedars that ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtands on the tops of high mountaines firmly rooted in flintie rockes, be ſo ſuddenly throwne downe, what
<pb facs="tcp:20338:10"/>
ſhall ſmall ſhrubbes ſhroode themſelues withall, who yet ſcarſe recouered, but entring the ſuperficies of the earth, is hardly able to abide the ſweete breathed Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne blaſt? If ſuch bee the vnconſtant ſtate of your greateſt Kings, what is the fickle fortune of your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſubiects? Then ſee I my ſelfe here happie in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of fate, hauing naught wherein to ioy, I ſhall loſe nothing which ſhould vrge me to weepe. Much talke paſſed betwixt them to this effect, when as the King willing to be againe releaſed from that priſon, wherein he was perforce detained, fell in perſwading this wilde man to accompanie him into the peopled world, where he might liue with men, and leaue theſe wilde woods where was no company but beaſts, telling him the pleaſure was like to proceede from the one, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting paines he ſhould ſtil be put into by the other. But ſo farre had the former tale of his riſing and ſudden fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling diſſwaded him from dwelling in that Icie ſtay, where he that is ſureſt is vncertaine how long he ſhall ſtand, that he thought it better dwelling in a lowly val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, from whence lower he could not fall, then climbing to the height of a hill, where his fortune was euer in danger to fade. At laſt when the King perceiued all his labour loſt, he deſired his companion againe to conduct him to the place where before he found him ſolitarilie ſitting by himſelfe: which though he was loath to doe, fearing leaſt by that meanes he ſhould loſe his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, yet notwithſtanding inforced by the earneſt intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this his new found friend, he condeſcended to his requeſt. And they two together trauailed ſo long that at length they came downe into another dale on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of that hill where the morning before they met, through which lay many faire pleaſant paths that directed the way to euery adioyning place, where the ſauage man loath to ſtray too farre, leaſt he ſhould not

happily hit backe againe on his owne way, leaues his friend to his better fortune, where for a while we muſt alſo leaue them both, <hi>Perſeus</hi> in trauailing into the world to ſeeke ſome more faithfull friends, and <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> returned backe againe into the forreſt, to his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed companie.</p>

Whereto he for feare condeſcended, leaſt if he ſhould haue denied, their crueltie might haue cut away the hope of his after har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt, which for all this trouble hee hoped in the ende to atchieue.

This brute beaſt without offering her violent iniurie, which is a thing not commonly found in their kind, ſets her ſafely down in her caue, where ſhe quietly kept her till ſuch time as her companion came in, to whom with her fayre won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fawning ſhe preſents her prize. The woman bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter imboldened at the ſhewe of a man, then ſhe was of the ſtill fearfull ſight of the beaſt, begins ſomewhat to recouer her loſt colour, and with fearefull cryes gins ſuddenly implore his ayde againſt the enuie of that her naturall enemie. At whoſe ſight the man ſomewhat ioyfull to ſee the ſhape of another, in whom was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the ſhew of himſelfe, gins with his ordinarie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment to welcome her to that homely houſe, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her that ſuch was the extraordinary nature of that beaſt, that ſhe would neuer harme any creature: and then falling into further talke, he begins to enquire of
<pb facs="tcp:20338:13"/>
her what drowe her downe into thoſe melancholy meades, where ſaue himſelfe ſeldome or neuer comes any ſuch creatures. To whom ſhe begins to relate a contrary courſe of her foreled life, fearing leaſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſound of her voyce in reiterating the remembrance of her death-meriting deedes, would not onely incurre his anger, but ſtirre vp that ſenceles beaſt to wreake their woes, whom ſhe ſo vnworthily had wronged, and therfore tels him that ſhe was a woe wearied woman, that in her melancholy moodes bad left the poore place where ſhee dwelt, to ſoiourne in ſome vncoth vnfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented ſhade, where no delightfull day might ſolicite to her ſad memorie, the loue of her forepaſſed life no chéerefull ſunne might cheriſh her cold chilled limmes, nor pleaſant newes of neuer dying ioy might bring her backe againe to her former felicitie. At which tale the wild man, though himſelfe had neuer felt the force of powerfull paſſions, that winds mens bodies like a workmanſhip in waxe: yet pitying that in her he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer taſted in himſelfe, tels what trueth tolde him, that hard was her hap to change her chéerefull conſorting companie of friends, to deſolations ſad diſcomforture amongſt her foes, to come from whence ſhe was firſt brought vp, to that place where ſhe was finally caſt downe, except (quoth he) you can frame your fancie to vndergoe the beaſtly behauiour of theſe vnciuill crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, amongſt whom I now liue, and with whom I meane to dye: for ſuch a rumour heare I to runne of the inconſtant courſe of mightieſt monarchies, which alſo in ſome I haue ſeene true, that from the higheſt braunch they are oft bowed downe euen to the loweſt barke of the bulke, that I finde more ſwéete content in this vnchangeable ſtay, then they in their ſtedfaſteſt ſtate. In which talke they beguiled the time, till night ouertaking them both, admits no more interpaſſage of
<pb facs="tcp:20338:14"/>
friendly ſpéech, where he to his ordinarie reſt, and ſhe to her accuſtomed complaints, betakes themſelues, ſhée telling in ſecret to her ſad heart the heauy burthen of her groaning griefes, whoſe heauy ſoule melted with the inforciue furie of her ſtill crying ſorrow, deſtils in amber teares: ſometimes ſhe thinkes of her huſband, and then hope helpes her vp with this thought, that though long, yet they ſhall againe méete at laſt. Then remembers ſhe the children, as well that of her owne as the other, that by her meanes was maſſacred, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing heauens had heaped iuſt vengeance vpon her for her former ſinnes. And laſtly, when ſhée thought vpon her ſelfe, then comes dead death with his cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie coloured countenance, and inforces her not to bluſh for ſhame, as doe the outward ſhewes of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but looke pale for pitie as the vſe of ſuch guiltie guides, that not onely leades themſelues into that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureles gulfe of neuer recouering griefe, but alſo intiſes other into a world of woes, from whence there is no retiring. Thus did ſhe preuent that which euer was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying to preuent her, the all ſtilling ſtate of ſecure ſléepe, where her thought was ſtill ſtumbling of ſome ſinne, whoſe iuſt iudgement was likely to inſue vpon her after life, till in the ſecret of the ſilent night there ſuddenly ſounded ouer their heauie heads y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noyſe of a fearefull purſute, as though ſome angrie beaſt had inſolently riſen vpon another ſimpler ſort, where ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly into the Caue where they then lay, deſcends downe the likenes of a liuely creature, not ſuch as was wont to accompanie them in their Caues, but others that elſewhere, with vntimely diſturbance waken the ſleeping wits of watchfull men, at which they were all affraid. The Lioneſſe for that ſhe theſe many daies had neuer béen in any ſuch ſort diſturbed; the man for that ſince his firſt comming thither, hee neuer viewed any
<pb facs="tcp:20338:14"/>
ſuch thing; the woman for that ſhe dreamed of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie euent that ſhould inſue of that ſudden vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore: but as euery wonder becomes at laſt more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie then it ſhewes at the firſt, ſo in the end by the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow ſearching Moone, they might more eaſily eſpie that which had driuen them all into this extraordinarie doubt, the ſubſtance of the other ſiſter, whoſe fault was equal with the firſt, and ſo was her repentance as readie as any of the reſt. But how ſudden ſorrow ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke her heauie heart, in finding that in the ende from which ſhe fled in the beginning, a Lyon from whoſe clawes ſhe thought ſhe had cléered her ſelfe. But as it fares in the euer ſwelling ſurges of the ſenceles ſeas, that the weary water working men fall from the grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die gripe of Sillaes ſhiuering ſhores, into the couert of Charibdes cruel courſe: ſo fares it with her that flying from the bare ſhew of death, was fallen into darknes it ſelfe. Where when ſhe ſaw ſo many contraries coupled in one ſubiect, as crueltie with curteſie, fell inforciue furie with friendly for bearing fellowſhip, reaſonable caitiues there ſubiect to vnreaſonable creatures, ſoule poſſeſſing bodies with ſauage profeſſing beaſts. But at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth ſhe ſatiſfied with the ſhew of them, and they glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with gazing on her, the ſauage man as curteouſly begins to welcome her, as he gaue gentle gréetings to the other, and with ſuch wordes as his yet vnkindly curteſie did affoord, intertaines her. And for that the trouble some time of the night did not afford ſuch ſhew of further fauour, as by his promiſe he purpoſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme in the day: ſhe by the other ſoftly ſits downe her ſelfe, betwixt whom you muſt now imagine ſuch dumb demeanes of friendſhip, for feare to procéed, as whileſt they were, well could not come from curteous loue. There doe theſe two with outwarde ſhewes diſplay ones plaints to the others paſſions. Many dumbe
<pb facs="tcp:20338:15"/>
demeanes paſſed betwixt theſe two, till after long lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering ſhewes, that with their diſſembling ſhadowes, had lulled againe into a ſlumber theſe two careles crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whoſe nature ſuſpecting nothing els but naked trueth, without all further inquiſition fals againe faſt aſléepe: which when theſe two wofull women had wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie weyed, they taking this aduantage of time, gins quickly one to murmur to another the euents of their ſeuerall iournies. And here muſt I now leaue further to enuey againſt their enmitie, and talke now of their ſolemne contrition, wherein we muſt not wey the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of their childrens rape, but the remorce of their ſins remembrance: faults that are péeuiſhly perſecuted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues the pitie of no one: but crimes wilfully commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with the remedie of repentance are mightlly amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Which in theſe two proued moſt true: for there each other confeſſing to themſelues in theſe perils the daungers they did one to another in their peace, with womaniſh woe that ofter in teares more bewayles their vnfortunate ends, then they foreſec their two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward beginnings, and then with many teares torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts themſelues too much, which they might well haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented with a little, curſing too late that which is come at laſt vpon thoſe crimes they committed at the firſt. And here let me ſhew their vnconſtant ſtate, not ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alwaies in a ſtay, but wauering like the winde, ſometimes proſecuting with loathed diſdaine, them which once they did follow with louing deſire: then changing their copie as cowards do their countenance, that wauer with the wind of euery buzzards blaſt, they againe begin to deſire what before ſo déepely deteſted: ſometimes with haſtie men too ſoone bréeding their own ſorrowe, and then with ſloathfull ſiuggards deferring too long to ſalue their owne ſores, oftentimes weauing their owne woe, when they ſuppoſe they worke ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="tcp:20338:15"/>
wracke. For ſo vnwarie are their wits, that they neuer think of that ſhould follow, from the force of that which goes before: but like the vnfortunate Larke that drawne downe with the dazeling glide of a decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing glaſſe, delighting ſo long in his game till he be cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the gin: ſo fares it with theſe fond fooles, that God knowes are too gréedie of ſome ſiluer deceiuing ſhewes, and yet buſie enough to bite off others gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den baites. Yet not ſo prouident as the poore Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, that hauing eſcaped the foulers fetter, with her chéerefull chirping giues notice to the reſt of her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: but where themſelues haue ſeene many fall, they yet deſperatly follow.</p>
            <p>Here might I extend this Satyricall vaine, but that I wil not be accounted as one that loathes what other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loues: &amp; therfore wiſh they could amend what euen themſelues ſees plainly amiſſe, and in themſelues learn to feare that, which by example of their owne ſexe they cannot beware. And thus pitying them, whoſe hurt reſts onely in themſelues to helpe, I will referre you to wonder at theſe two wicked women, whoſe déedes had ſo far diuided the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, till that vnlooked for luck had met them together againe in that deſolate place, whom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing diuorce had parted in their peopled palace: there gin they one to another relate the tragicke ſtorie of their forepaſſed purpoſes in their diuers imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of each others iniurie, till at laſt according in one conſent they mutually moue what they had malitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ment, till that lamenting each to other their lewd liues, they with inſtant iutreaties ſolicites the neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayling forces of all helping heauens, that with fauour they would looke vpon their faults that had indéede de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued their iuſt frownes.

well guiding gouernment they ſometimes fade, yet ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doe they for euer fall. For ſuch is their flexible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as like the Philoſophers table they willingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe vpon themſelues euery ſeuerall impreſſion, but commonly their nature nouriſhes but one: as when the profit prouing merchant viewes the ſeuerall ſorts of ſundrie commodities, though there be many that hée well could like of, yet is there but ſome fewe that eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially he can loue: ſo is it in the ſeldome ſecuritie of this ſexe, that buſying themſelues with many, they binde themſelues but to a few. Nay, ſhall I compare them to a fitter forme of reaſon reſembling creatures, as when the Lapwing houering farre from her neſt, ſéemes to deſcry the daunger of her young néere hand, which hée that ſuffers his patiens to ſearch ſhall finde farre off: ſo haue I heard it proued true of them, whoſe policie in this I muſt néedes approue, if well performed to bée perfect: for that they colour thereby the cunning of their own ſkill, and withdraw the otherwiſe beholders affections farre off, not to looke to that practiſe they in ſuch ſecret performe.

At laſt, after they had walked with him round about the borders of his bounds, they begin to diſſwade him from that beaſtly place of abode to goe abroad into the world, and there learne to liue like a man, ſhewing what daunger was in the one, and what delight in the other, perſwading him that by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes time would try the trueth of this his fedious ſearch, in be wraying the meanes by which he was brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Unto whom a great while he would giue no eare, becauſe it ſhould ſeeme that contented eſtate wherein he then ſtoode ſo fitted his humour, as that he little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded all the gay ſtories they could tell him of glorie or dignity, wealth, or whatſoeuer good thing this world doth giue. Yet at the laſt with their inceſſant perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, he determined a while to goe trie the trueth of their ſtorie: but with this promiſe, that as they profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red honeſtly to vſe himſelfe, ſo ſhould they alſo kindly comfort thoſe two diſtreſſed women, that had vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſtraied from their homes, and rely them only vpon
<pb facs="tcp:20338:19"/>
his reliefe. Which they with many proteſtations ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely promiſed to doe. And ſo in the end taking away with him thoſe two, by whoſe meanes he was made the ſubiect of that nuſcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, departed altogether from that place, and iournied towards their homes againe. In which way nothing was done, ſaue that they ſtill were telling one to another the ſtorie of their foreled liues: and with that tattle beguiling the time, till they came to the place where was their abode, and there preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to their Captaine their pray, they begin to relate what happened them in their iourney. Thus with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſalutations was he intertained, and often imployed in their affayres, wherein he ſo proſperouſly procéeded, as that he was not onely beloued of all the companie, but déerely eſtéemed of their chief Captaine, and ſo ſtill imployed abroad. In the meane time were the poore Quéenes, whom fortune had thus baned to and fro, buſied at home: for by this time were theſe Outlawes waxen excéeding rich, and their Captaine intirely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting <hi>Liuia</hi> his wife, daughter to one of theſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne Quéenes, had carefully prouided her of the curiouſeſt conceits that all that countrie did affoord: where, for that theſe two women that had ſometimes béen Princes ouer many people, could well ſkill of that kind of pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pering pride which women are wonted to vſe, grew in ſuch great requeſt with their Ladie, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all her attendants they eſpecially were honoured. Here hence grew they again into a new mutinie which of them ſhould beſt deſerue to bee deſired, one priuilie ſeeking to ſpoile what another had curiouſly conceited, the other practizing means to hinder her ſiſters work, that it might proue of little worth. Long in this ſort gan they diſagrée, till at laſt with their enuious emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation they ſtirred vp all the aſſemblie to ſuch ſtrife, as had not the care of the charie Captaine in time refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb facs="tcp:20338:20"/>
it had brought ſelfe-working harme vpon their owne heads. Such was the grounded malice of theſe two cruell creatures, as that though feare in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie made them agrée as friends, yet in the leaſt ſhew of péeping proſperitie they begin again the fierce aſſaults of deadly foes. Who for the better agréement of their whole houſe, they were glad to ſeparate in twaine, to ſée if that bred friendſhip being aſunder, that brought out nothing but hatred betwixt them whileſt they were together.</p>

the Senatours wiſely with curteous countenances gaue this anſwer: That for ſo much as they were there met to challenge the kingdome ſeuerally to themſelues which ſhould bee ioyntly inioyed of them both, pleaſed but their Lordſhips to giue them leiſure for theſe fewe dayes to conſider of this caſe, and then they would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere them both to their owne contents.

After whoſe abſence, theſe carefull pillers of that crafte Common-wealth, begins to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with themſelues what were beſt to doe in theſe daungerous dayes. At length they thought good themſelues, that to auoyde the inconueniences which was likely to light vpon them by this purpoſe, it were beſt for them, as they did at the firſt, to gather forces together: for by other meanes they would not bée ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, and by that deuiſe aſſay to driue them backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Which the better to effect (for that countrie was ſcarſe able of it ſelfe to affoord ſufficient force for that fight) they preſently diſpatch aſſurance of pardon, and promiſe of rich rewarde and great dignities to the Captaines of all thoſe Outlawes, that were incamped in ſeuerall places of that countrie, if but by ſuch a day they would bring in their ſeuerall powers, to the ende they might augment their armie againſt theſe home-borne enemies.

In the meane time came the day wherin they were to giue anſwer to their

ſeuerall demaunds. At what time comes back both the Harolds to knowe their determinations. To whom the Senatours foreappoynted for that purpoſe, begins thus mildly to reſolue them in their requeſts. Since (quoth he) the ſtate of theſe times wherein wee now liue, requireth ſuch ſuretie of ſafegard, as may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the enuious force of any froward fortune, wée to preuent the purpoſe your ill meaning maſters intende, which is no leſſe then the ruine and decay of our whole Common-wealth; as ſtrongly as wee may haue here furniſhed our ſelues with ſuch forces, as this time and place could affoord. But for that once (which we muſt euer confeſſe) they were our happie Kings, though now they be vnhappie people, and that of right to them doth belong this gouernment that wee now guide, if they ſetting aſide all ſiniſter hate, will come and friendly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine repoſſeſſe this Crowne and kingdome, and with mutuall loue ſtriue to maintaine that, which with their enuious emulation they now maſſacre and maime, then on our ſhoulders will we beare their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and with according ſtrength helpe them to ſtay this tottering ſtate, which their déedes haue almoſt brought to decay: but if incenſed with the fire of furious flaming enuie, they wil not worke their thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to this thing, but with fire and ſworde will néedes lay waſte this ſometimes worthie Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, then will wee oppoſe our ſelues againſt their threats, and ſeeke ſuch a mends for this miſchiefe, as ſhall with iuſt iudgement pull downe their puffed vp plumes, and turne them out againe into the wide world to become a worſer ſkorne of miſchance.

Which when the enemies ſaw, they as readie to take the occaſion as the other to offer, gins furiouſly to ſet vpon them, where ioyning ſtreight at handie ſtroakes, there followed a long and furious fight, the victorie to neither part declining, till at laſt Adrianus that then had the charge of a Cornet of horſe, breaking into the bowels of the enemies battels, wrought ſuch wonderfull atchiuements, as made him iuſtly accounted for the beſt approued ſouldier that that countrie did euer containe, with whoſe worth the foes were ſo diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fited, that on a ſudden affrighted they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke themſelues to flight, whom he eagerly following ouertooke the two Kings, that by chance had met in the battel, eagerly occupying their ſeete to eſcape y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſcourge of their enemies hands, whom hee ſurpriſing brought backe againe to their homes, and preſented them to the Senate as the firſt fruites of his fortune.
