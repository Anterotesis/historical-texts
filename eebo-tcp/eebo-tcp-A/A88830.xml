         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Read your laſt Leter to a Friend of mine very neer his <hi>Majeſties</hi>
Perſon, and gave it him to peruſe by himſelf, or ſhew it, if he
thought fit. He told me your Lordſhips account of <hi>Affairs</hi> in
<hi>England.</hi> As it is, in it ſelf, very ſatisfactory, ſo it well agrees with
ſeverall Letters and Relations from others, and confirms our
hope, That his <hi>Majeſties</hi> undoubted Right, will ſhortly be in <hi>ſignal manner,</hi> atteſted
and aſſerted, by the <hi>univerſal ſuffrage</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Parliament:</hi> And
that after long <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> we ſhall once more flouriſh under a <hi>King,</hi> for all <hi>Vertues,</hi>
requiſite in the <hi>Greateſt Prince,</hi> I dare ſay <hi>inferior</hi> to none of his <hi>Predeceſſors.</hi> Many
paſſages, in your Letter my Friend obſerved, but one above all the reſt, <hi>(viz)</hi> The
ſurmiſe of many diſaffected Perſons, and jealouſie, even of ſome of our <hi>Friends, That
the</hi> King, <hi>in his late great Extremities, either to procure ſome Aſſiſtance, or, perhaps a bare
Livelihood, which then he wanted, may poſſibly be Engaged, in Contracts with Foraign
Princes, not altogether conſistent with the true</hi> Engliſh <hi>Intereſt.</hi> This he thought, was
not to be ſleighted, in regard it ſeemed to carry with it much danger, and ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour:
And therefore forthwith reported it to his Majeſty, Who did me the Honor
to take notice of it as my Intelligence, and aſſure me upon his Royal word, <hi>That he is
ſo far from having Contracted with any</hi> Prince, <hi>to the prejudice of his Countrey, as he never
yet in all his Diſtreſſes, entertained any Treaty, which would not become the beſt of</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<hi>and</hi> Engliſh-men; <hi>Or which, (had it been otherwiſe fit) he ſhould not have
wiſhed, the whole Nation might have heard; That he ſtands obliged only upon the account
of hoſpitality and great Civility, which, he hopes he ſhall ſhortly be in a condition to requite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, ſince the <hi>King</hi> hath been pleaſed ſo far to condeſcend, as to truſt me
in a matter of ſuch <hi>importance,</hi> I hold my ſelf obliged in Duty, and Gratitude to his
<hi>Majeſty,</hi> in <hi>friendſhip</hi> and <hi>ſervice</hi> to your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> to tranſmit it to you, That your
<hi>Lordſhip</hi> may (as I doubt not but you will) make your utmoſt uſe of it for his
<hi>Majeſties</hi> ſervice; And ſurely, my Lord, you may do well induſtriouſly to Court
Occaſions of publiſhing, and propagating a Newes ſo Honourable to the <hi>King,</hi>
ſo Significant to the <hi>People,</hi> ſo Seaſonable to the <hi>Time,</hi> and Comfortable, I doubt
not, to all <hi>Loyall Engliſh</hi> hearts: For, whether we reflect on the <hi>mighty Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> who hath brought his <hi>Majeſty</hi> out of a <hi>fiery Furnace,</hi> as it were, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>ſinging of his Hair or Cloathes;</hi> Or, the <hi>incomparable Vertue</hi> of our <hi>King,</hi>
who, next to his <hi>Bleſſed Father,</hi> deſerves to be ever <hi>Celebrated,</hi> as the <hi>chiefeſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>
of his <hi>Countrey;</hi> Or our own <hi>unmerited happineſs</hi> in ſuch <hi>multiplyed Deliverances,</hi>
and eſpecially in the injoyment of ſo <hi>Excellent</hi> a <hi>Prince,</hi> The thing is every way moſt
<hi>conſiderable,</hi> and muſt needs appear ſo even to the <hi>meaneſt Capacity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the middle of the next Week, I intend, God willing to wait on your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>
at <hi>London,</hi> and ſhall then endeavour to ſatisfie your <hi>Curioſity.</hi> For the preſent this
place affords little <hi>publick Newes,</hi> That being a Commodity now expected only
from <hi>England,</hi> you will therefore, herein, excuſe,</p>
