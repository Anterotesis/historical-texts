            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this changeable viciſſitude of decaying time, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall ſucceſſion of dying ages, there is nothing more certain then <hi>death,</hi> which is painted forth in the face of all living creatures, <hi>Man</hi> not excepted, the nobleſt of all, who in all ſexes, rankes, and conditions muſt once die, and then enter into judgement. For this radicate moiſture muſt drie up, and this naturall heat muſt grow cold, this ſoaring breath muſt flie up, and this ſurmounting ſoul muſt flit out of this earthly tabernacle, that it may returne unto its native ſoil, where it ſhal reſt eternally in theſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly manſions, ſtately habitations, and moſt pleaſant paradiſe of God: Whereunto Chriſt the ſpoiler of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers, our captain, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
<pb facs="tcp:19483:3"/>
and perfect Saviour is victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and triumphantly gone before us, and now (according to his comfortable promiſe) is preparing a ſure place, a royall palace, for all thoſe, who with a godly ſorrow groane under the unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable burthen of their grievous ſins, and with aſſurance of faith beleeve in, and long after his ſaving and glorious appearance. So that we need not ſorely and immoderately lament, for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of thoſe whom we once dearly loved in this ſower valley of tears and weariſome pilgrimage of many ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, every houre whereof is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then another; Seeing they have joyfully and happily arrived at their journeys end, heaven, and at laſt are crowned with incomprehenſible glory, ſtrengthened with never<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>fading im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie, repleniſhed with exquiſite joyes of Gods favourable preſence, and drowned with over-flowing pleaſures at his right hand for evermore. Theſe
<pb facs="tcp:19483:3"/>
points with many others in that kinde I have handled in this ſubſequent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, firſt publickly delivered by me in a Sermon at the buriall of an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Baron with his religious Ladie both laid in their grave at once, whoſe names of bleſſed memorie I conceal from thee, for ſuch reaſons as I thought good. Which meditation ſurely I had buried with them, or at leaſt cloſed up in my ſtudy, if not the good opinion of conſcionable and zealous hearers had raiſed it up again from the grave of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, by their diligent ſearch and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of manuſcripts here and there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed far from my expectation &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer intention. So that I was forced to review and inlarge the originall copie by the advice of my learned and much reſpected friends; ſuch as reverend pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, doctours and paſtours of our church, who have beſt skill in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſpirituall importance. For I have ever been of that minde, that every wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:19483:4"/>
man ſhould make choice of ſome intire and truſtie friends, who will be ſo far from flattering and foſtering him with a ſelf conceit, that by the contrary they will plainly admoniſh him of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and infirmities, and give him ſound and ripe counſel, when there is any buſineſſe in hand that may eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerne his credit and eſtimation. Amongſt the which the operations which flow from the gifts of the minde have the firſt place: &amp; ſeeing none, how capable ſo ever, is fully adorned with them, he ſhould ſeek help of others. For God hath not given all gifts to every one; and he who is ſhorter-ſighted then I, may ſee a ſpot in my face which I cannot ſee my ſelf; and it were to be wiſhed that there were more premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in this age, ſo fertile of invention, wits and writs. Did the Greek oratours and Poets go to their <hi>Athenaeum,</hi> and the Latine to their <hi>Aedes palatinae,</hi> for to conſult with the moſt learned of their
<pb facs="tcp:19483:4"/>
time about the divulgating of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents; and we who have more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine documents then ever any paganiſh Writer could dream of, bring forth ſo abortive fruits? As for my ſelf, I will not anſwer for others, but if I had had no other to take counſel by, ſurely this lucubration ſhould never have ſeen the face of the ſun, or come unto the hands of theſe cenſuring and critick dayes: where there is nothing ſo good, but it hath its own carpers and enviers, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo bad, but it hath its own favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and embracers. In it I meddle not with curious and fruitleſſe queſtions, new doctrines, dangerous tenents, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with varietie of oſtentative and ſophiſticate learning, and farded with the abuſed colours of pratling and adulterate eloquence, wherewith too many ſeek their own praiſe, by diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their ſincere profeſſion, by venting their loftie preſumption, by ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing their holy mother the church, by
<pb facs="tcp:19483:5"/>
defiling the white robe of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, laid abroad to us in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie, integritie, ſimplicitie, and maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of divine ſcriptures, which ought to be the only ſquare and rule of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the touchſtone of our ſpeculations, and the ſoveraigne judge of all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. Which controverſies alas, to the unſpeakable grief of the better ſort, to the pitifull ſeduction of ſome miſcarried ſimple ones from the puritie of truth to the impuritie of errour, to the inevitable deſtruction of many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate ones to fearfull and damnable inconveniences, what by ſects, ſchiſmes and hereſies this long time ago, what by oppreſſions, murthers, maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, as bloudy conſequences, have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the peace of this Chriſtian world. Neither did I ſuffer this ſermon to come to open light, becauſe it was my own brood, and firſt iſſue upon that grave purpoſe, which requireth moe years, deeper learning, ſounder judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:19483:5"/>
longer experience, then I, a youth, can attain to for the preſent, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of two reaſons which I adde to the former: The firſt is, becauſe there is no meditation more familiar to me then that of death: Out of the countrie, many thouſands did fall on every ſide of me: and in my countrie, ſince my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to this painfull and dreadfull cure of ſouls, one ſpeciall point of my charge is to viſit thoſe good Chriſtians (over whom I watch) at their laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to this world, that I may render a joyfull and comfortable accompt of them to my Maſter the great ſhepheard of the flock. The ſecond reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of two men, whom I highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured during their pilgrimage here; The one was a principall nobleman of my paroch, who in his journey to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven took ſuch pleaſure in reading this meditation, that he himſelf did dict it to one of his ſervants a little before his death. And I dare ſay, without flatterie,
<pb facs="tcp:19483:6"/>
that his generous and religious ſoul did even in this life in a ſingular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner taſte of the glorie to come. O what divine ſentences! O what comfortable ſpeeches did he utter to us who attended on him! O what raviſhing contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and private ſoliloquies had his ſoul with God on his death-bed! Theſe, as ſo many antidotes, preſervatives &amp; corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boratives he uſed againſt that laſt ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: By theſe, as ſo many ſcales he climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to the heavens. The other was my dear &amp; honourable father, who before his departure out of this mortall life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted much in reading, hearing &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating on this diſcourſe, and hoping that others ſhould get inſtruction, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and conſolation thereby, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to publiſh it. So that I could not diſobey him, who was Gods inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to bring me unto this world, to train me up in the fear of the Lord, and who both in, and out of the country, did proſecute me with his tender &amp; fatherly
<pb facs="tcp:19483:6"/>
affection in my painful travels, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous expeditions for the golden fleece of vertue, &amp; whoſe life was a clear mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Chriſtian charity, yea above his power oftentimes, which he did recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to his children: for the Lord bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him with abundance to the end, and in the end crowned his former favours with a pleaſant and peaceable death, which he oft craved at Gods hands, and which was a matter of greater content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to me, then if he had left me heire of whole territories, which with the reſt of the toyes of this periſhing world have but tranſitorie joyes, like clouds riſing in the morning, but diſſolving ere night without any memorie of them at all. Nevertheleſſe, honourable birth, good education, the patterne of worthy acts, and the immortall fame of renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned anceſtors, either in church or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, communicated to the emulous po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie for imitation, is not the leaſt portion of humane inheritance: and he
<pb facs="tcp:19483:7"/>
who follows their famous examples, ingraven with letters of gold in cheſts of cedar, or in tables of marble, in the never-decaying temple of ſacred me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; he (I ſay) is not only in the way to worldly honour and preferment, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo their footſteps lead him from grace to glorie, which is the moſt precious purchaſe a Chriſtian can acquire. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which all is but dung and droſſe: for one drachme of goodneſſe is better then a whole world of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; even as a little pearle is of greater worth, then a big rock of flint; or as the ſun is higher eſteemed then the whole body of the firmament ſpangled with ſtars, every one ſtriving with another in beautie.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort then, it is no inbred opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of my ſelf, who am conſcious of many infirmities in this body of death, that maketh me to acquaint thee (O Chriſtian Reader) with this funerall meditation, which perhaps may live
<pb facs="tcp:19483:7"/>
when I am dead. In the mean time I wiſh it may teach thee, me, and other mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men, our Chriſtian duety in this point, reſt with us familiarly at home, warne us in our journey, remember us of our preſent mortalitie, guard us againſt our laſt enemie, prepare us for that future immortalitie and full happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſoul and body conquered to us by the victorious death, and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous paſſion of the only ſon of God our only Saviour: In whom I reſt ever,</p>

            <head>A preface before the Sermon.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E are all here conveened this day to performe the laſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duties to a reſpected and worthy Baron, with his honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Lady, who both have lived amongſt you in this land, and whoſe embalmed corps, both yee now honour with your mourning preſence, and happy farewell to their grave. I am here deſigned to put you all in minde by this premeditate ſpeech, that the next caſe ſhall be aſſuredly ours, and perhaps when we think leaſt of it. Therefore that I may acquaint theſe who need information in this point with the nature and matter of ſuch exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, let them remember with me that there are two ſorts of funer all ſermons, approved and authorized by our reformed churches in Europe: The firſt whereof, I call, for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſake, <hi>Encomiaſtick,</hi> or <hi>Scholaſtick,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:19483:9"/>
becauſe it is ſpent in the praiſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct, and only uſed in ſchooles, colledges, academies, and univerſities, by the moſt learned; And this is ordinarily enriched with pleaſant varietie of ſtrange lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, lively lights of powerfull or ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, fertile inventions of alluring poeſie, great ſubtilties of ſolid Philoſophie, grave ſentences of venerable fathers, manifold examples of famous hiſtories, ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of memorable peoples and nations; and in a word, with all the ornaments of humane wit, learning, eloquence. Which howbeit I might borrow for a while, yet I lay them down at the feet of Jeſus, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent hither not by man, but by God, whoſe interpreter and ambaſſadour I am, I prefer before them the ſmooth words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the ſtately of <hi>Eſay,</hi> the royall of <hi>David,</hi> the wiſe of <hi>Salomon,</hi> the eloquent of ſaint <hi>Paul,</hi> and the raviſhing of ſaint <hi>John,</hi> with the reſt of divine writers, Gods pen-men, out of whoſe inexhauſted treaſurie of heavenly conſolation, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:19483:10"/>
knowledge, I wiſh to be furniſhed with the ſecret preparation of the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie, and to be accompanied with the full power and evidence of the ſpirit of my God. For there is another ſecond ſort of funerall ſermons, which I call <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick,</hi> or popular, viz. when the judicious and religious preacher, only for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and edification of the living, frequently aſſembled at burials, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſiring at ſuch dolefull ſpectacles to be rejoyced in the ſpirit of their mindes, taketh ſome convenient portion of ſcripture, and handleth it with pietie, diſcretion, moderation, to his private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, the edification of his hearers, and the exaltation of the moſt high name of God. So that having no other ends but theſe three, and taking God to be my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that I abhor all religious or rather ſuperſtitious worſhip given to the dead, and being naturally obliged to come here, and oftentimes requeſted by my near and dear friends, yea abundantly warranted
<pb facs="tcp:19483:10"/>
by theſe who have the prioritie of place in church government above me, and as it ſeemeth by your favourable ſilence, and Chriſtian attention, invited to ſpeak, I have purpoſed by the ſpeciall concurrence, and aſsiſtance of the ſpirit of my God, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver unto you a brief meditation upon death. Pray ye all to God to engrave it by the finger of his all-pearcing ſpirit in the vive depth of my heart, that again by way of ſpirituall communication, I may write it upon the tables of your hearts (as it were) with a pen of iron, and the point of a diamond, that both preacher and hearer may lay it up in their memories, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it in their lives and converſations. And I intreat you all (and moſt of all theſe who are of a tender conſcience) I entreat you I ſay, in the tender bowels of mercie, not to miſconſtruct my coming hither, which ought rather to be a matter of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar comfort, then of prejudged cenſure; a matter of profitable inſtruction, rather then of envious emulation; a matter of
<pb facs="tcp:19483:11"/>
pious devotion, then of repining conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I think not ſhame, with the glorious apoſtle to preach in ſeaſon, and out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for the converting, winning, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathering of ſoules. I do not ſay this, That I conſent to theſe who contemne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne altogether ſuch meetings; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I would confeſſe unto them, that the time, place, and perſons were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie (as indeed they may ſeem to theſe who have not travailed out of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roch churches, or ſeen forrein countries) yet the cuſtomes of the primitive church (ſee <hi>Nazianzen, Ambroſe, Jerome,</hi> &amp;c.) and of our reformed churches in France, Genevah, Germanie, upper and lower, in great Britaine, and elſewhere, maketh all three ordinarie; and the ſubject of this preſent meditation, viz. <hi>Death,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the ſame to be common.</p>

               </gap>, it is prepared; and ſo indeed it is prepared for all men once to die: But our Greek and Latine, ancient and moderne writers tranſlate it, ordeined, decreed, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all men once to die. I embrace their orthodox verſions; yet they will ſuffer me to explain this word by others in ſcripture, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

I confeſſe all theſe foure words are to man diverſe, <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do percipiendi;</hi> yet to God, they are all one; who howbeit he be the firſt and the laſt, yet in him there is neither firſt, no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> laſt. So that the meaning is this; It is the
<pb facs="tcp:19483:12"/>
irreſiſtible will, eternall decree, unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able purpoſe, unſearchable counſel of the wiſe and everliving God, That all men and women living upon the face of the earth, muſt once die. <hi>Obj.</hi> But this may be called into queſtion by two or three inſtances taken out of the old and new teſtaments: In the old, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 5. we read, That Enoch was no more ſeen by man, but taken by God. And 2 <hi>King. cap.</hi> 2. that Elias was caught up in a fierie chariot unto heaven, ſo that they were both tranſlated not to ſee death. In the new we read, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. That theſe who ſhall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive at the day of judgement, they ſhall be changed in the twinckling of an eye, and caught up into the clouds for to meet with the Lord in the aire, and to be ever with him; ſo that theſe alſo ſhal not taſte of death. I anſwer firſt, That ſome few extraordinarie inſtances do not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther break the band of ordinarie courſes once ſet down by God, who is without ſhadow of turning or changing. Secondly, I anſwer, That Enoch and Elias, in ſo far as they were men, they were mortall, but in ſo far as they were ſuch men, they were immortall, that is, In ſo far as they were
<pb facs="tcp:19483:13"/>
types of the reſurrection and of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totype Jeſus, the immortall, coeternall, coeſſentiall Son of God the Father. And as for thoſe, who ſhall remain alive upon the earth on that great day, their death will not be reall, but analogicall, not actuall, but virtuall or equivalent, that is, They ſhall not die as their predeceſſours, a naturall death; but their extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie change ſhall ſupply or be in ſtead of an ordinarie death. So that ye may mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly perceive, the appointment of God is ſurer then the center of the earth, or the foundation of the heavens: for theſe two are grounded upon it, and it upon none, except it ſelf, the center and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament of all, whoſe appointment is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in whom there is no compoſition, no accident; <hi>Quicquid enim in Deo, Deus eſt;</hi> that is, whatſoever is in God, is <gap reason="foreign">

our death, and the death of our beſt beloved? for the Chriſtian heart ſhould not be a marble, but a melting; not a ſtony, but a fleſhie; not a hardened, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart; and godly ſorrow is one of the paſſions thereof. 2. Inſtinct of nature: not only the tender hearted Pelican, but the irony hearted Oſtrich wil love her young ones: the cruell Lyoneſſe, the fierce Tigre, the fierie Dragon, the venemous Serpent, Viper, Baſilisk will bring up, and nouriſh their wicked broode; and ſhall a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mother forget her childe, or when it is dead before her, not let a tear fall? or can the ſon here preſent, ſee his loving fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and compaſſionate mother lye cold and ſtiffe, and not ſigh, ſob, groane, weep, to teſtifie his inward, howbeit inutterable grief? in ſuch caſe where the eyes are dry, the heart muſt be of ſtone, flint, adamant. 3. Practice of Chriſt, who wept over dead <hi>Lazarus;</hi> he might have quickened him at the firſt inſtant, yet to expreſſe his naturall affection hee wept: but we, ſeeing we cannot reſtore theſe two unto life, let us mourne for them, for fear the God of nature thinke us unnaturall, who if wee ſhed moderate teares, hee will ſeal

upon that ſame publick example of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 24? <hi>I anſwer.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all occaſions are not alike, by reaſon of the divers qualities of the defunct, who being all one to God, to man are not ſo. Therefore if at any time great lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhould have place, and if the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, miniſtery, commonaltie, ſhould utter their inward grief, with outward ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture-of cloathes or ſpeeches; then it ſhould be eſpecially at the death of good, godly, and vertuous pr inces, who becauſe they are Gods lieutenants, deputies, and vicegerents, and vive repreſentations on earth, God himſelf calleth them gods, and will have them to die like men. Now as in their lives and reignes we ought them for conſcience ſake, worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and civill honour: ſo in their death we ſhould be affected towards their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie memories as it becometh Chriſtians; becauſe oftentimes by the ſinnes of the people many princes reigne: for our ſins, alas, our ſinnes they remove the light of Gods favourable countenance with the beſt men in church and policie; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are not worthy of them, ſuch as Heroick kings, well-affected nobles, wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:19483:25"/>
counſellers, great officers of ſtate, inferiour judges, religious prelates, &amp; zealous preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who are as ſo many lamping lights and beautiful ſtars in the right hand of Chriſt, fixed by God in the firmament of his mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church, are often taken from us in judgement; and if they be once eclipſed, like the ſun, they breed darknes upon the horizon of this inferior world. Did ye not deeply conſider, when that God from the heavens did frown upon us, in taking away the only <hi>Solomon</hi> of our time, our gracious Soveraigne King JAMES of thrice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py memory, two of our ſpeciall pieres, two props of our common-wealth; with two great divines, two pillars of our church, followed a little thereafter, and yet we had greater occaſion to mourn for our ſinnes then for them? for they were taken away, that they might not ſee the judgements to come. But not to digreſſe overmuch upon this diſcourſe, receive theſe two wholeſome inſtructions. The firſt is out of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> a wiſe, though not a canonick book, chap. 38. <hi>Let tears follow the dead, and cover his body accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome, and neglect not his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, and then comfort your ſelves for your</hi>
                  <hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:19483:26"/>heavines, for it cannot do him good, but hurt you.</hi> I remember of the Epitaph of one of the kings of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Looking upon me, learn to lead a holy and gody life. And if the dead would ſpeak, they would teach us this, <hi>Videte quod ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, eritis quod ſumus, fuimus quod eſtis;</hi> See what we are, ye ſhal be as we are, we were as ye are. To this effect have two eies in buriall, one caſt upon the dead, and ſo there will be none of us ſo unnaturall, but he will be touched as he who feeleth not the loſſe, but the abſence; not the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie, but the libertie; not the death, but the change of his friend to a better eſtate. And if we do ſo, our cariage cannot but be decent, modeſt, circumſpect, wiſe, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; in a word, Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, another eie fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon God, who is al eye, and not only beholds the things of this great univerſe, but alſo the very inward reines, and moſt latent corners of the hearts of men. And if we do ſo, there wil be none of us but wil bridle his natural affections &amp; ſecret paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in ſuch faſhion, that they carry him not beyond the bounds of right, reaſon, moderation, religion. The ſecond is out of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 13, 14. <hi>I would not</hi>

And thus farre of that generall doctrine with the uſes thereof. Now let me come to ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall doctrines which are as ſo many ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequences of it.</p>

And as ſaith Epicurus, againſt all other things we may arme our ſelves, but againſt death there is no armour, for it conſumeth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour it ſelfe: in which ſenſe <hi>Alexander</hi> the great ſaid to the <hi>Gymnoſophiſts,</hi> hee could not give them immortalitie. And the wiſe man affirmeth this, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 16. <hi>The grave, the barren wombe, the earth, and the fire, they never ſay, Enough.</hi> As the barren womb cannot be filled with ſeed, nor the earth with waters, nor the fire with fewell, ſo the grave is never ſatisfied with the dead. Death is rigorous, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, inexorable, irrevocable, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable. This is verified in the worthie Patriarchs, or Genearchs, before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the floud; in the religious judges and kings of Iſrael, in the divine Prophets, Evangeliſts, Apoſtles, in the reverend fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, doctours and preachers of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

one perſon, hypoſtatically united, albeit he was the prince of life, to lay down his precious life for man, dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, and ſo take away the guilt of ſinne, and the ſting of death. So that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie is that man who ſeeks and ſues by all meanes to flee from death; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he go it wil meet him, either ſoone or late, or whoſoever places his chief felicitie here, where there is nothing but miſerie, or thinkes of a brittle and tranſitory cottage, to make a ſure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent citie: for as long as we are in the fleſh, we are abſent from the Lord, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred and ſequeſtrate from our eldeſt brother, who even now is preparing a place for us, that ſhal never be taken from us.

                  </gap>, a life not a life. And this ſhall be more manifeſt if wee take a view of our ages. Firſt, our infancie is full of infirmitie and tears; when we are in our mothers bellies, the leaſt fall of her may cruſh us into pieces, the ſmoak of a candle may ſmother us, and ſhe is ſo aſhamed of our birth, that no honeſt matron deſireth to be delivered of us in publick; And are we once come to light, we creep in our own filth when other creatures take them to their feet or wings to feed themſelves. Secondly, our child-hood is full of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe and fooliſhneſſe, we hunt after toyes and trifles, not able to govern our ſelves; weariſome of the inſtruction of our parents and maſters; and when they have much troubled themſelves with us, we are not worthie perhaps the paines taking on. Thirdly, our youth-hood is full of vaine, idle, and raſh pleaſures, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:19483:30"/>
us to debauchery, lulling us aſleep in their boſome for to cut our throat, like ſo many pillules of gold, which under their outward beauty, keep an inward ſowreneſſe; like ſo many <hi>Dalila's</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray us to our enemies; or like ſo many <hi>Syrens</hi> to devour us; or like ſo many <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſes</hi> to kill us with a kiſſe. Fourthly, our man-hood is full of pride, emulation, ambition, with thouſands of carking, irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and pricking cares: ſo that in this life we walke upon briars, and he who hath the crowne on his head, his heart is full of thornes, and neither his purple, nor his precious ſtones, nor the magnificence of his fare, or his court, can keep him from traitours, flatterers, and aſſaſinates. So that ſome princes have thus ſpoken of their purple, O cloath more glorious then happy! Fifthly, our old age is full of ſickneſſe, complaints, miſeries; for when a man hath done what he can to make himſelf honourable, rich, learned, wiſe, then it cometh to the which few winne; many wiſh to come to it, but they are no ſooner arrived, but they would bee far from it: for with it are catarrhs, colick, gravell, gout, fever, &amp;c. till that death
<pb facs="tcp:19483:30"/>
give the ſtroak; ſo that we begin in tears, and end in miſeries. Aſtrologers, ſuch as <hi>Proclus, Ptolemee,</hi> and <hi>Aliben,</hi> have more ſubtilly then ſolidly compared our ages (looking to the perfection of the ſeventh number) to the ſeven planets, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Firſt, our infancy, humide, move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to the moone, in the which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving none, or very little uſe of reaſon, we live and grow like plants: and in this only we differ from them (as <hi>Philo Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus</hi> ſaith) that other plants have their roote on earth, but ours is in the heaven. Secondly, our child-hood to <hi>Mercurie,</hi> wherein wee are taught and inſtructed. Thirdly, our youth-hood to <hi>Venus,</hi> the dayes of love, dalliance, and pleaſure. Fourthly, the <hi>Zeni</hi> of our youth, the prime of our beauty, to the ſun in his goodly array. Fifthly, our ripe and full man-hood to <hi>Mars,</hi> when we bend our deſires, intentions, determinations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards preferment, honour and glory. Sixthly, our raw old age, to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> when we begin to number our dayes and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our hearts unto wiſedome. Seventhly, our rotten and decrepit age <hi>to Saturne,</hi> when we are overclouded with ſorrow,
<pb facs="tcp:19483:31"/>
tending to the doore of death, which ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wide open at all times to all perſons, when the tyde of our dayes ſhall have a perpetuall ebbe, without a full <hi>plemmura,</hi> &amp; our leaf once fallen, ſhal never ſpring up againe, till that the world be no more. So that ye ſee, howbeit the ſpaces of our ſhort time be compared to the heavens above, yet they make us not immortall. For as they have their owne courſes, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne and end according to their proper motions: even ſo wee are wavering and wandring planets, till that our firſt mover God ſettle us with eternall reſt. In the mean time, we may ſay with <hi>Job,</hi> ch. 14. 1 <hi>Man that is borne of a woman is of few dayes and full of trouble.</hi> And with <hi>Jacob, Few and evil are the dayes of my pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</hi> Therefore let us live as ſojourners, aiming at our journeys end; as runners, looking for the prize; as fighters, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the crowne: for this is a ſtrange land, and this world is a baniſhment, and heaven is our countrey, and paradiſe our native ſoile, and GOD our Father, and Chriſt our Brother, and the Spirit our comforter, and the ſpirits juſtified our kindred, and the holy angels our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
<pb facs="tcp:19483:31"/>
Why doe we not long for them? But alas, poore miſerable wretches that we are, wee fix not the eyes of our ſoules upon that life which is hid in Jeſus, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe wee would bee willing to lay downe this tranſitorie, uncertain calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous life, for to regain that permanent, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and glorious life. Oh, if wee could ſee with the eyes of faith the things that are not ſeen by the eyes of a naturall man, and which wait for us! then ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand worlds would not hold us back from them; for if there were ſo many, they would not bee able to content our illimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted deſires, and infinite appetites. What is then able to fill them? I anſwer; the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne good, the great GOD, with the ſuperabundant treaſures of his free grace, and undeſerved favour, and bottomleſſe ocean of the multitude of his medicinall compaſſions. O Lord, drowne us therein, that the deep of our uncurable miſeries may be ſwallowed up, by the deep of thy reſtaurative, and preſervative mercies: for this is the life of thee our everloving, everliving God in Chriſt Jeſus. Sweet hearts, pray that ye may bee once inſpired by this; and ſurely heaven ſhall bee your
<pb facs="tcp:19483:32"/>
home; God your portion, ſtrength, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, with whom if once ye dwel there, yee ſhall lacke nothing. What would yee have? Is there a better then eternall life? it is there. Would yee have a crowne? Is there a bettter then an incorruptible crowne of uncomprehenſible glorie? it is there. Would yee have a kingdome? Is there a better then that which cannot be ſhaken? it is there. Would yee have an inheritance? Is there a better then an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, undefiled, that fadeth not away? it is there. And where? where the pooreſt begger of you ſhall bee richer then all the kings of this earth; for putting a way his clouts, he ſhall put on the glorious robe of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and receive that crowne of juſtice, weightier then the whole maſſe of this earthly globe, becauſe it is the eternall weight of glorie, and ſo is more precious then all the diadem's and ſcepters of <hi>Alexander, Caeſar;</hi> with the mightieſt princes, who now are turned into muddy duſt, filthie ſtinke, dreadfull horrour, perpetuall oblivion: for death is able to make us know our ſelves one day. It will tell to the proud, that he is abject; to the rich, that hee is a beggar; to the
<pb facs="tcp:19483:32"/>
beautifull, that hee is evill favoured; to the ambitious, whom now territories, and dominions will not content, then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven foot of ground ſhall cover him, with theſe two ſhort words, <hi>hic jacet;</hi> here he lyeth; &amp; <hi>quem terra non cepit, urna capit: Hee whom the univerſe could not containe, his aſhes lye in a little pitcher.</hi>

The wiſe man compares thee to a ruinous houſe, which decayeth piece and piece; but that compariſon is familiar to thoſe who are acquainted with ſcripture. The certaintie whereof ſhould weane and ſpean our affections from the baſe things of this earth, and ſhould worke in us an ardour of minde, a vehemencie of ſpirit, a ſerious and ſedulous endeavour to bee delivered from the priſon of this body, the Red ſea of the miſeries of this life, the captivitie of ſinne, the thraldome of our corruption, the tyrannie of Satan. Yee know, if a couragious man be many years in a ſtinking, ſolitarie, and dark pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he would be glad to change his infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous life, with a glorious death: But if

the judge command the jailour to bring him forth to bee ſet at libertie, I pray you, when he ſeeth the brightſome light of the ſunne, and taſteth of his wonted joyes in meat, drink, apparell, companie, is he not raviſhed within himſelf? Even ſo it is with us, while we are in <hi>Meſech,</hi> in the Egypt of ſinne, under our ſpirituall Pharaoh the devil, being compaſſed about with robbers on the land, pirates on the ſea, hereticks in the church, few or no godly men, we cannot but be plunged in a deep dungeon of grief and ſorrow. But when it will pleaſe that unappealable judge, that high poſſeſſour of heaven and earth, to command the jaylour, Death, to looſe us from the priſon of this body, then we ſhall behold the glorious face of the Sonne of righteouſneſſe, and eat and drink of him, who is the bread and fountain of life, and be clad with the robe of his juſtice, and enjoy the bleſſed companie of Saints and Angels in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of happineſſe.

And in another place, fire, gallows, beaſts, breaking of my bones, quartering of my members, crucifying of my body, all the torments of the devil together, let them come upon me, ſo that I may enjoy my Lord Jeſus, and his kingdome. This made <hi>Hilarion</hi> to ſay, Depart my ſoule, why feareſt thou? why trembleſt thou? thou haſt ſerved CHRIST now almoſt ſeventy yeares, and art thou afraid to depart?

<pb facs="tcp:19483:40"/>
calleth it, A ſleep, a reſt of our fleſh in hope, a going to our fathers, a gathering to our people, a recommending of our ſpirit to God, a rendring up of the ghoſt, a walking with God and the Lambe. <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay here; Why ſhould we not fear, ſeeing worthie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yea reverend church-men who led a godly life, and exhorted ſundrie not to fear, were mightily troubled at their death, and when they ſhould have had moſt peace, they were moſt diſquieted? <hi>I anſwer.</hi> Their fear was a diligent, not a diffident; a holy, not a helliſh; a filial, not a ſervile; a godly, not a deviliſh fear; becauſe they feared God as a judge, and they hoped in him as a Saviour; they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, and ſo they ſued for him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing from the tribunall of his juſtice, to the throne of his mercie; <hi>ab irato Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſare ad placatum,</hi> from an offended God in the height of his juſtice, to a pacified God in the depth of his mercies. And I would have the ſimple ignorant people to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> know here, that outward diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in fits, of heavie, exaſperate, invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſickneſſe, are not evident and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tokens of a totall or finall deſertion:
<pb facs="tcp:19483:41"/>
for the godly patients may have inward joy, glorious and unſpeakable, which the ſtanders by ſee not. And by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, ſome who have led a lewd life, without any remorſe of conſcience, or compunction, or contrition of heart, may ſeeme to have a peaceable death, and ſay that they are ready for their God, when in the meane time their heart gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth their mouth the lie. Others deſire to die, becauſe of great povertie, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable paines, or loſſe of goods, good name, friends, &amp;c. But God make us not to fear death; becauſe we are aſſured of his favour in the pardon of our huge, and manifold tranſgreſſions, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, for that is only the thing which juſtifieth us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:19483:42"/>
godly it is the gate to heaven, and hither you muſt make your progreſſe. 2 <hi>Object.</hi> It takes away my life, which is ſo near and dear unto me. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Upon a condition to give a better which ſhall never bee taken from thee. 3. <hi>Object.</hi> But my loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are great. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Let me never hear that of thee againe, that it is a great loſſe of ſuch a mans life, or that thou loſeſt any thing in death; that is an idle querimony, to the which <hi>Socrates</hi> anſwereth, <hi>O dii boni, quantum lucri eſt emori!</hi> O what great gaine is it to die! for ye may leave an earthly poſſeſſion, for an heavenly patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie; uncertaine goods, for a certaine treaſure; the company of the wicked, for Saints and Angels; earth, for heaven; baſeneſſe, for glory; unſufficiencie, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencie. 4. <hi>Object.</hi> But there are paines in death. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without paines, and the better the thing be, the greater paines: but to ſpeak properly, it is the remnant of thy life that tormenteth thee, and not thy death: for what is it but a not being in this world? for when we are, death is not: and when death is, wee are not. Now a not being hath no dolour: for
<pb facs="tcp:19483:42"/>
as when wee were not at all, wee found no dolour, ſo when we ſhall not bee, wee ſhall finde none. Wherefore then feareſt thou the day of death? for every day of thy life is a preparation to it; and that laſt period of dayes is not properly thy death allenarly, for every day contributeth to it. And as the laſt drop emptieth not, nor filleth the bottle, and the laſt path wearieth not, nor the laſt ſtroake cutteth downe all the trunke of the tree, but every one help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another: ſo every day we go to death, and the laſt, wee arrive at it. So that it boats with us, it rideth behinde us, and leaveth us no more then the ſhadow of our bodies, till at laſt it cut the thred of our deſires and lives, and take us from the world, and from our ſelves. So that we die at all houres, and all moments, and if we deſire to live long, we enjoy a languiſhing death victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in many aſſaults. So that <hi>Epictetus</hi> anſwered well to <hi>Hadrian,</hi> demanding this queſtion, Which is the beſt life? he anſwered, The ſhorteſt. And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, That the day of our death is better then the day of our nativitie: for this is
<pb facs="tcp:19483:43"/>
the beginning of our dolours, and that is the end, and our acceſſe to ſupreme hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe: for then this body ſhall returne to the duſt, and the ſpirit to God the giver, with whom we ſhall enjoy a full life, and our paſſions ſhall be buried, and our reaſon enlarged, and the whole man placed in his owne element, the heaven his countrey, from the which hee was baniſhed.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, did not <hi>Cicero, Seneca,</hi> and before them <hi>Theophraſtus, Crantor, Xenocrates,</hi> leave rare monuments and documents, againſt immoderate dolour in death, as alſo againſt the fear thereof? but thou art better taught then thoſe, that death is the very entry to that eternall day, <hi>nunc ſtans</hi> feaſt, Sabaoth, with the Ancient of dayes, and that the ſeparation of the ſoule from this body, is nothing but an union and communion with God. And ſhall naughtie ſouldiers under their temporarie captaine, hazard their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent life at the mouth of the canon in a furious skirmiſh for the pennie-pay, and thou not lay down this tedious life for the kingdome of heaven, whereunto thou haſt undoubted right, by thy triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:19483:43"/>
generall, the captaine of thy ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Lord Jeſus, the Lord of Hoſts? 5. <hi>Object.</hi> But the pangs of death are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, who can abide theſe cruell and deadly wounds? <hi>Anſwer.</hi> That ſame Jeſus by his glorious and meritorious death, hath ſweetned, ſeaſoned, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them to thee in ſuch faſhion, that they ſhall be unto thee like the launcet of a Chirurgion, which pricketh and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth together like worme-wood; or the potion of a skilfull mediciner, which is ſowre, but wholeſome. 6. <hi>Object.</hi> But the feare of judgement after death, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me afraid. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> That ſame Lord Jeſus, judge of judges, thy eldeſt brother ſhall be thy judge, in that great day of retribution, and remuneration, and hee cannot but looke upon thee with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate eyes, ſeeing he is fleſh of thy fleſh, and bone of thy bones, and thy cauſe is his cauſe, for he is thy advocate, and interceſſour daily. 7. <hi>Object.</hi> But the paines of hell, which are unſpeakable, univerſall, eternall, are very fearfull, and much affright me. <hi>Anſw.</hi> That ſame Jeſus thy redeemer, as he made the grave his bed, ſo hee keeps the keyes of hell, and
<pb facs="tcp:19483:44"/>
the gates thereof cannot prevail againſt thee. To conclude then, let us all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve couragiouſly to attend death, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide all fear, ever hoping that the Lord ſhall be with us, to the end and in the end.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed ſhall we be if we die in him, for ſo we ſhall reſt from our labours, and in death celebrate three ſolemnities. Firſt, our birth day: for wee ſhall revive. Secondly, our mariage day, which ſhall be accompliſhed with Chriſt. Thirdly, our triumph day: for through Chriſt we ſhall triumph over the world, our own fleſh, ſinne, death, the grave, hell, the devill, principalities and powers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, and receive that crowne of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. So that through Chriſt we are more then conquerours, who ſaith, <hi>I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them from death: O death, I will be thy death: O grave I will be thy deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Hoſea chap.</hi> 13. 14. Are wee gods in Chriſt? let us not fear death. <hi>Lethum non omnia finit, Propertius:</hi> Death puts not a period to all things. I ſay more, death maketh us endleſſe. <hi>Cicero</hi> affirmeth, that after death hee ſhall bee immortall. <hi>Horace,</hi> that the beſt part of him ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:19483:44"/>
live. <hi>Ovid,</hi> that the beſt part of him ſhall be carried above the ſtarres. The <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, Brachmanes, Indians, Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Perſians, Macedonians, Arabians, Americanes,</hi> and all poliſhed nations have conſented to the immortalitie of the ſoule. But here wee ſurpaſſe them, that after death and reſurrection, our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhall live for ever.

               <p>I prove the firſt, that there is nothing more certaine then death, leaving the former reaſons. Firſt, from the word <hi>fatum,</hi> which expreſſeth the nature of death; ſo called, a <hi>fando,</hi> becauſe the Lord hath ſpoken it; his word is his work.

                  </gap>, nature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a viſible God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a compend of this great world; and as the heavens and earth wax old and periſh, ſo he, the reſemblance of both, muſt follow the patterne. I confeſſe with <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> and <hi>Triſmegiſtus,</hi> that he is an admirable piece of nature, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:19483:45"/>
both natures, ſuperior and inferior, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created and created do meet in him. And if theſe viſible creatures bee as ſo many ſcales, to climbe to that inviſible Creator, man muſt be one of the moſt curious ſteps of that ladder. If we look within the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals of the earth, we may ſee there rich mines of ſilver, gold, and precious ſtones. If we behold the face of it, we ſhall finde there ſuch a varietie of herbs, flowers, fruits, trees, creatures, which may breed admiration in the dulleſt ſpirits. And is the ſea leſſe admirable, by reaſon of the flux and reflux thereof, the quantitie of fiſhes and monſters therein nouriſhed? And is the aire any thing inferior to theſe two: full of fowles, clouds, raines, ſnow, haile, lightnings, thunder, and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable meteors? But when wee lift up our eyes to the aſtoniſhing vault of heaven, whoſe curtaines are ſpread over theſe, enlightned with the ſunne and moone, and twinkling ſtars, with their towres, retowres, aſpects, effects, influences, we cannot but be raviſhed with a more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and divine contemplation. Yet here is a greater wonder, that all theſe things are abridged in thee, O man, of
<pb facs="tcp:19483:46"/>
ſeven foot-length? And as the world is a book in the which God may be read in capitall letters: ſo both the world and God, may by the moſt ignorant, eaſilie be read in thee as in a written table, ſeene in thee, as in a clear glaſſe. Thy fleſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the duſt; thy bones, the rockes; thy liver, the ſea; thy veines, rivers; thy breath, the aire; thy naturall heat, the fire; thy head, the heavens; thy eyes, the ſtars; thy joynts, moving ſo active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſinnews ſtirring ſo nimbly, ſenſes working ſo quickly, like the ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts of nature, But I pray thee enter within thy inward parts ſo excellent; thy ſpirit ſo ſupernatuall, thy reaſon ſo divine, thy appetite ſo infinite, thy ſoule <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the engraven image of God: thou maiſt juſtly ſay, that thou art <hi>ultimus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae foetus,</hi> the laſt eſſay and effort of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the theater whereupon God may be ſeene with mortall eyes, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the foure corners of the world: thy face, the eaſt; thy back, the weſt; thy right ſide, the ſouth; thy left, the north. And whereas other creatures have their countenance downward towards their naturall mother the earth, thine are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb facs="tcp:19483:46"/>
toward thy ſpirituall father, God; that thou mayeſt raiſe thy ſelf from all earthly vanitie, to a ſerious contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the divinitie, wherein are placed thy unchangeable comfort, thy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able contentment, thy unconceivable feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie. Whence I inferre this; Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of us is like to the creature, muſt die; but that which hath received the indeleble character of God, is perpetuall. So that our ſouls are immortall, our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are vaſſals and ſlaves of death, in which reſpect wee are all ſaid to die.</p>
               <p>And that this doctrine may bee the more clear, I ſhall prove it in the ſecond place by way of induction. Look to the vertues; the ſtout as well as the raſh, or the coward; the temperate, as well as the untemperate or ſtupid; the liberall, as well as the prodigall or avaricious; the magnificent, as well as the niggard or vainglorious; the magnanimous, as well as the proud or puſilanimous; the modeſt; as well as the ambitious or baſe minded; the meek as well as the angrie, or anger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; the courteous, as well as the flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, or churliſh; the ſincere, as well as the diſſembler, or bragger; the civilized
<pb facs="tcp:19483:47"/>
man, as well as the ruſtick, or the ſcog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, or the officious pleaſant; the juſt as well as the unjuſt, muſt all once die. The ſtout man may fight againſt death; the temperate man keep a ſober dyet to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his life; the liberall propine it; the magnificent make expences; the magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous diſdain it; the modeſt ſmile at it; the meek embrace it; the courteous che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it; the civilized welcome it; the juſt man execute judgements upon others; but none of them can overcome death. Look to the ſuperiour faculties. The religious divine in <hi>foro poli;</hi> the curious lawyer, in <hi>foro ſoli;</hi> the skilfull mediciner in his ſhop, muſt all once die. The firſt of theſe may teach of it; the ſecond may make a teſtament after it; the third may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a recipe againſt it, but none of them can caſt off its yoke. Look to the arts and ſciences; the experimented Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian may finde out ſundrie ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the word Death in divers lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; the dainty Poet may make an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaph or Epicede; the flowing oratour, a funerall Sermon; the ſubtile Logician may diſpute <hi>pro, &amp; contra;</hi> the ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moraliſt may diſcourſe trimly upon
<pb facs="tcp:19483:47"/>
it; but what can theſe do, but what mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men can do, after all that they can do, die! Therefore let not the beaten war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour thinke, that all his ſtratagems can defend him, or the poliſhed polititian dreame that all the maximes of <hi>Matchia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,</hi> or the counſell of <hi>Achitophel</hi> can preſerve him. Let not the Geometer bee ſo buſie, as to ſearch out the place; or the Arithmetician, number the day; or the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologue, tell the manner of his death: let not the profound naturaliſt wade into the deep thereof; nor the tranſcendent Metaphyſician flee from it: for there is no art nor ſcience under heaven which will learn a man not to die. Looke to the ages; the embrion in its mothers bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the babe on its mothers breaſt, the wanton child, the raſh young man, the ſtrong man, the wittie man, the old man, the decrepit man; all muſt once die. Look to the conditions of men: Prince, paſtor, and people, all muſt once die. And to compendize that which I thought to enlarge, both elect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, all muſt once die; they for the abolition of their miſeries, and poſition of their happineſſe: theſe for the poſition
<pb facs="tcp:19483:48"/>
of their miſeries, and remotion of all happineſſe. They to be glorified in ſoule and body: theſe to bee damned in both. So that the godly die, that they may live to God, and with God in heaven; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly die, that they may live to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and with the devill in hell. God preſerve us from hell, and reſerve us to heaven.</p>
               <p>I prove the ſecond point of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which is this; There is nothing more uncertain, then the time, place, and manner of death, as a poet ſaith, <hi>Nemo novit mortis tempuſve, locumve, modumve:</hi> The time, whether in the ſpring, ſummer, harveſt, winter of the year, or of mans years; whether at the point of the day, morning, mid-day, evening, night, mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, it is uncertain. He that dieth ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the morning, is the babe; he that dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at the third houre, is the young man; he that dieth at the ſixt houre, is the ſtrong man; he that dieth at the ninth houre, is the old man; and he that dieth at the eleventh houre, is the decrepit man. And therefore the Greek poet compareth man to an apple, which is either pulled off before the time, or elſe in time falleth
<pb facs="tcp:19483:48"/>
off on the ground. And <hi>Epictetus</hi> to a candle, which is expoſed to winde; it may ſhine a little, and then goeth out. The place, whether in thy houſe, or in the temple; in thy bed, or at the table<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the mountain, or in the valley; in the wilderneſſe, or in the fields; on ſea, or by land; in or out of thy countrey, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. The manner, whether by ſword, famine, peſtilence, ſickneſſe, heat, cold, hunger, thirſt, racke, rope, by peace, or warre, by a naturall or violent death, it is uncertain. Of all theſe I might bring both exotick and domeſtick examples, but I leave them to your daily reading, and hearing of divine and profane hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Onely I inferre theſe uſes upon the precedent doctrine, by way of direction from the dead, and conſequently from theſe two dead corps lying before us.</p>

               <p>The firſt direction is, <hi>Vive memor lethi, fugit hora, Perſius.</hi> In thy life remember of thy death, for thy houre ſlippeth. Time is precious, but ſhort; and this is a hard leſſon, <hi>Memento mori.</hi> This was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="tcp:19483:49"/>
to be ſaid to the Emperours in that great triumph at Rome, <hi>Memento mori, homo es, mortalem te eſſe memineris,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to die, man thou art, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thou art mortall. All theſe did follow <hi>Philip, Alexander</hi> the greats father, who commanded his chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain thrice every day to round the ſame ſentence in his eares. To this effect, when the Egyptians did ſolemnize their natall dayes, they had a dead ſcull upon their table, to put them in minde of their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie. One Church-yard in <hi>Paris,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, hath moe ſculls, then there are living heads in <hi>Scotland.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Jerome</hi> was wont to have in his ſtudie before him, a dead mans ſcull with a running glaſſe. But alas, ſuch is our follie, that ſcarcely can wee remember of death, when wee ſee the ſame painted upon the mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath: wee may loſe a legge to day, an arme to morrow, an eye the third day, and theſe will not teach us to prepare our ſelves towards it. Conſumption in the lights, a ſtone in the bladder, the gout in our feet, the palſie in our hands, 2000 known ſickneſſes in our bodies, (to omit unknown, for every member of our
<pb facs="tcp:19483:49"/>

Chance tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, that death is latent; infirmitie, that it is patent; old age, that it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as ſaith <hi>Hugo.</hi> What? for all this we cannot be enough admoniſhed. And this is it that <hi>Jerome</hi> findeth fault with, <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidie morimur, quotidie commutamur, &amp; tamen aeternos eſſe credimus:</hi> We die day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, we are changed daily, yet we think our ſelves eternall. In the mean time, in our moſt lively life we may perceive the verie print and footſtep of death. For we do ſee continually, and hear the cryes of mothers for their children; of ſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for their husbands; of ſervants, for their maſters; viſitation of ſick, medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, preachers, in our houſes, at our bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, all warning us, that we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by death.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</note> Now my Noble, Honourable, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent, and well beloved Auditors, leaſt I ſhould omit any circumſtance of this action looked for by you, I come to theſe two dead corps lying at the lippe of the grave, from which yee have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſix directions, and if they could ſpeak any more, they would make up the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, which is the moſt perfect num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that is to ſay, Learne of us to die, for ye muſt follow after us; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come backe unto you. So their mouthes are ſtopped, and we need not to ſpeak unto them any more, for they will
<pb facs="tcp:19483:53"/>
not hear us, therefore wee muſt ſpeake ſomething of them. To pray God for them, we ſhould not, for it will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile them; to praiſe them (howbeit praiſe worthie) I am aſſured that criticks and cenſurers would take to themſelves larger matter, then perhaps were given them, all conſenting with one voice and minde, that I a friend were driven by the violent ſtreame of affection, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous ſtorme of paſſion, either upon the <hi>Scylla</hi> of oſtentation, or the Charibdis of aſſentation. But I hope the ſaile of my ſinceritie ſhall carry the ſhip of my minde from theſe two rocks, to the ſafe harbour of your favourable audience, and ſparing cenſures; and that my mouth ſhall utter nothing, but that which the carper himſelf, a framed friend, an impartiall judge, a charitable chriſtian ought to ſay, to wit, That this rare ſpectacle of one husband and ſpouſe which cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in death, would ſeeme in the eyes of a naturall man pitifull and deplorable, but to us who ſee with ſpirituall eyes, joyfull and comfortable: for they are with God. And this is remarkable, Their joy was one, their grief one, their love
<pb facs="tcp:19483:54"/>
one, their life one, their death one, their buriall one, their tombe one, their grave one, their glory one. And great is our u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, howbeit we be ſeparate for a while: for charitie biddeth us ſay, That our baptiſme is one, our faith one, our hope one, our love one, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward one, our pilgrimage one, our race one, our warfare one, our countrey one, our common-wealth one, our citie one, our religion one, our church one, our ſpirit one, our Chriſt one, our God one, the father of us all, above us all, in us all, all in all.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſtrait bands betwixt them and us, for that ſame golden chaine of mercie which hath pulled them unto heaven is faſtned to our ſouls, that we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in our own time may be drawne hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In the meane time we are baniſhed and ſtrangers, they gone home and citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; we in <hi>Sodom,</hi> they in <hi>Zoar;</hi> wee in <hi>O Enon,</hi> they in <hi>Salem;</hi> wee in a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall cottage, they in a celeſtiall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe; we in clayie tabernacles, they in glorious pavilions; we are on this border of the ſea, they on the other; wee drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſea, they in the ark; wee in the

And what more? we ſick, they whole; we blinde, they enlightned with that inacceſſible light; we ſee through a glaſſe, they face to face; wee know in part, they fully; we poore, they rich; wee naked, they cloathed; wee weare clouts and rags, they bear crownes and ſcepters; we hungrie, they ſatisfied; we feed upon the fruits of the earth, they upon that quickning <hi>Manna,</hi> the bread of Angels; we impriſoned, they ſet at libertie; and that which the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant would thinke a wonder, wee dead, and they living. Why go wee then with mourning apparell, ſeeing they have white robes? Why weep we any more, ſeeing all teares are wiped from their eyes? Why do wee lament, ſeeing they ſing ſongs of triumph upon golden harps and viols, with the melodious, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious

ſweet-ſinging-choreſtrie of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? Surely if it were poſſible that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified ſouls were ſubject to grief, they have greater occaſion to mourn for us, then wefor them, whoſe bands amongſt themſelves are ſo unſeparable, that death cannot break them; and greater love wee read not of any two then of theſe: for it is ſtronger then death. O happie couple above the eloquence of man and angel! Many a loyall husband and chaſte ſpouſe would be glad of ſuch an end. And what an end? Let the envious Momus, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious backbiter hold their peace, and let me who ſtand in the preſence of God, and in the face of his people, and in the chaire of veritie, tell the truth: to wit, That honourable Baron whoſe corps ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there in the flower of his yeares, in the ſtrength of his youth, in the prime of his deſignes, even when young men uſe to take up themſelves, is fallen, and mowne downe from amongſt us, like a may flower in a green meadow.</p>
               <p>His vertuous Lady who having lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed a little after him, howbeit ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in body, yet ſtrong in minde, and full of courage, took her dear husbands death

in ſo good part, that ſhee did not give the leaſt token of hopeleſſe and helpleſſe ſorrow. Yet wearying to ſtay after her love, ſhe poſted after him, and ſlept peaceably in the Lord, as her husband before her.</p>
               <p>This, Noblemen, Gentlemen, and men of account amongſt us have aſſured mee. So then, as neither the husbands ancient houſe, nor his honourable birth, nor his noble allye, nor his able and ſtrong bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor his kinde, ſtout, liberall minde, nor the reſt of the ornaments which were in him alive, and which recommend brave gentlemen to the view of this ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing world, could keepe him from a preceding death. So neither the ſpouſes noble race of generous and religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitours, nor a wiſe carriage in a well led life, nor the reſt of her womaniſh perfections, could free her from a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent death, both due to them and us for our ſins. God hath forgiven theirs; God forgive ours alſo. They have done in few, all that can be done in many yeares; They have died well: God give us the like grace. In the mean time, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and exuvies, <hi>terrae depoſitum,</hi> ſhall

How ſhall we then conclude, but with a hopefull and eternall farewel, till it pleaſe God, that wee all meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on that great day, on Sion hill, and go into theſe everlaſting tabernacles of the temple of the moſt High, in the holy citie, ſupernall <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> amongſt the Hierarchies of that innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of Angels, the generall aſſemblie and church of the firſt borne, written in heaven by the finger of God, and the bloud of the Lambe?

               <p>O fooles that we are, wee long with a vehement deſire, to ſee our earthly princes coronation in this earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: I pray you let us wiſh with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impatience, redoubled ſighes, unfained groanes to be diſſolved, and to bee with Chriſt, that wee may ſee our owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious coronations in that kingdome of glory? For, O what ſolemnities! O what feſtivities! O what exultations! O what exclamations! O what triumphs ſhall be there! when the heavens and earth ſhall clap their hands for joy. Why do theſe baſe minds of ours creep any more like wormes on earth, and ſoare not with the wings of heavenly contemplation, that our converſation may be in heaven? Why do we not flie with the golden feathers of faith &amp; hope, to embrace in the armes of our ſouls our gracious redeemer, who is at hand, &amp; ſtretcheth forth his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hand unto us? O let us lift up our heads, &amp; open the everlaſting gates of our ſouls, that the king of glory may enter in, and finde roome therein, howbeit the
<pb facs="tcp:19483:57"/>
heaven of heavens is not able to containe him; who is the joy of the heavens, the hope of the earth, the light and life of the world, the eaſe of the oppreſſed, the comfort of the afflicted, the advocate of ſinners, the reward of the juſt, our only Saviour. O let us ſet our affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and behold him, whoſe love ſhed abundantly in our hearts, ſhould ſwallow all other love, who is the wiſedome of God, and ours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world, ſet as a roſe of ſtarres upon our head, when others ſhall bee confounded.</p>
               <p>Therefore bow downe the knees of your hearts, with your voices, your hands and eyes unto heaven, ſaying, O come thou (whom our ſoules both love and long for) Lord Jeſus, yea come quickly, and tye us unto thy ſelfe by the band of perfection, the coards of thy unſpeakable loue. Wee die, wee divine after thee, O ſweet life, O dear love! Tarrie not while we are ready, but take us to thy ſelfe, and cover us with the banner of thy love, and preſent us holy, harmeleſſe, acceptable before thine heavenly father, that wee may dwell with thee, and in
