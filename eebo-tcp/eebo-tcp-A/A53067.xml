         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Anſwer of his Excellency the Earle of New-Caſtle
to a Declaration of the Lord
Fairefax, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHen I received notice lately, of
a Declaration Dated the eight
of this Moneth, made by the
Lord <hi>Fairefax,</hi> intitling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
untruely, and contrary to his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<hi>Lord Generall for all the Northerne For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for King and Parliament;</hi> I could not chooſe
but wonder, either at the ſtrength of his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
to fancy ſuch a Government to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in His Majeſties Dominions, without His
Royall Aſſent (eſpecially knowing himſelfe
to be Proclaimed a Rebell, for ſuch Trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
courſes:) or rather at his deep ſubtilty,
under the pleaſant bait of His Majeſties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34673:3"/>
Authority, to hide the curſed hooke of
Perjury and Rebellion, and by the ſight of this
counterfeit Flagge, to ſeduce His Majeſties
good Subjects, contrary to their Oaths of
Allegiance and late Proteſtation, from their
bounden Obedience, to deteſtable Faction
and Treaſon: or howſoever preſumptuouſly
to profane His Royall name, to the raiſing and
fomenting an unnaturall Warre, in the bowels
of His owne Kingdome, directly againſt His
Sacred Perſon, Crown, and Dignity. Without
a Commiſſion under His Majeſties broad Seale,
he may be (as he is indeed,) an Uſurper and
latruder into power, for which he, and all his
Adherents; are obnoxious to His Majeſty and
the Law, in the high crime of Rebellion; but
cannot juſtly nor with any Colour of reaſon,
ſtile himſelfe <hi>Generall to the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
The very counterfeiting of this power,
without the true owner, leave, and againſt his
expreſſe Command, doth evidently ſhew, That
he knows he can have no <hi>Military</hi> Power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
His Majeſty, much leſſe againſt His Majeſty.
As it is the hearty deſire and prayer of all true
Engliſhmen, that they may ſpeedily ſee a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
conjunction <hi>of King and Parliament;</hi> ſo we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34673:3"/>
cannot but take notice, That they who joyne
them together in their Titles and Pretenſes,
are they, and onely they, that divide them and
ſever them in their actions, and retard our
hopes of an happy Union; partly by thruſting
us into reall miſchiefs, for fear of fictitious and
imaginary dangers, and partly by oppoſing a
ſound and ſatisfying Accommodation. But
perhaps it will be ſaid, Though he make bold
with the <hi>King,</hi> yet he derives a good Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from the <hi>Parliament.</hi> When the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
are legally Aſſembled in a place free from
Tumults, whither all the Members may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
with ſafety, and Vote freely without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
feare, or faction; then they are venerable
Aſſemblies: but at the beſt, neither have nor
ever had, without His Majeſties concurrence,
a power to raiſe Arms, or create Generalls, or
order the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom. <hi>England</hi>
did never ſee ſuch an Example, ſuch a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
never heard of ſuch a Challenge of Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Supremacy, made by the two Houſes
without the King, either in caſes ordinary or
extraordinary, before the beginning of theſe
pernicious diſtractions. All the Orders of this
Kingdome, aſſembled in Parliament, upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34673:4"/>
deliberation, in a caſe extraordinary (ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Parliament,) have diſclaimed this
power, and plainly acknowledged, That it is
an eſſentiall and inſeparable Flower of the
Crown, That it belongs ſolely to His Majeſty,
<hi>To defend force of Armour, at all times when it
ſhall pleaſe him, and to puniſh them that ſhall doe
contrary:</hi> and that <hi>the Prelates, Earles, Barons,
Commonalty are bound to aide him as their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Lord at all ſeaſons when need ſhall be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where the very Title is ſo apparently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
&amp; ſuppoſititious, what truth can be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the body of the writing? The firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his Declaration, are <hi>the Priſoners taken
at Seacroft.</hi> Surely he had great reaſon to have
expreſſed himſelfe more forward, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of thoſe poore ſeduced Perſons,
then hitherto he hath done, who without any
Authority on his part, or Obligation on their
part, did hazard both their bodyes and Soules,
meerly to do him ſervice. He pleads for them
that</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They had quarter promiſed them, that contrary
to the Rules of Chriſtianity, Charity, the Laws
of this Land, and the Law of Arms they have
been deteined in durance.</hi> It is true they had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34673:4"/>
Quarter given them, not out of any favour to
their Rebellious courſes, but out of Pitty to
their Perſons, and their miſled ſeduced ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
in hope that when their eyes were opened
they would returne to their former Loyalty:
but I never heard that they had any <hi>Quarter
promiſed,</hi> or that there was any Treaty held, or
any Covenants propoſed or condiſcended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
but a free and abſolute ſubmiſſion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
So the ſole and ſingle ground of this
invective Declamation, hath no more truth in
it then the Title. We are now told of <hi>Chriſtian
Charity,</hi> But where was the conſideration of
this Chriſtian Charity, when the accord made
at <hi>Rothwell,</hi> with his own conſent, was perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly
broken? the obſervation whereof had
ſaved the effuſion of ſo much Chriſtian
Blood, and prevented ſo many Murthers, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries,
Impriſonments of his Majeſties Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Subjects, onely for keeping their Faith and
Allegiance unſtained, and their Oathes invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated.
Theſe men deſire to be objects of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Charity,</hi> not Subjects, they would have
this grace looke towards them, but not from
them: or otherwiſe they would be aſhamed to
ruine ſo many thouſands of their Neighbours
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34673:5"/>
and Fellow Subjects, and yet talke of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Charity,</hi> as if it were a <hi>Topicall Argument,</hi>
not a <hi>Theologicall virtue.</hi> His next ſtalking
horſe is the <hi>Law of the Land.</hi> I would gladly
know where that Law is written, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
any Liberty or Privilege to a Subject,
who is taken in actuall Rebellion againſt his
Lawfull Soveraigne. If he and his Adherents
have no favour, but what the <hi>Laws of this
Land</hi> do afford them, they muſt expect releife
in another world, upon their repentance.
Neither will the <hi>Law of Arms</hi> help him. It is
a confeſſed truth, that there is no <hi>Law of Arms,</hi>
but onely between ſuch as have a power of
Arms lawfully inveſted in them. The <hi>Law of
Nations</hi> doth except a Subject from pleading
the Law of Arms againſt his Prince, or againſt
any Authority derived from his Prince. But he
ſaith further,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They have been deteined in ſuch durance and
under ſuch Tyranny, as there is about an 100 of
them dead, and about 200 of them made ſo ſick and
weake, as they are not likely to recover, and to the
reſt of them all neceſſary refreſhments are denyed,
with intention to reduce them alſo to the like wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
ſtate; and ſo in time to deſtroy them all.</hi> This
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34673:5"/>
and the like expreſſions conteined in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
being ſo publickly caſt upon the Officers
of this Army under my command, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
reflect upon my ſelfe: which hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
my deſire to underſtand the certainty
of theſe particulars, which being known, may
be a good caution to his Lordſhip, hereafter
to take heed how he builds his groundleſſe
confidence, (which he cals <hi>aſſurance</hi>) upon ſuch
weake and partiall informations. The woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Souldiers were dreſſed and cured by our
Surgeons, at our charges: The ſick Priſoners
were viſited by the Queenes Phiſitians, and
medicines given them at our charges; theſe
were no ſignes of any <hi>intention to deſtroy them:</hi>
They have wanted neither Sermons, nor other
Divine Offices: The Wifes and Siſters of
ſuch as have been ſick, have had free Liberty
from time to time to attend them: The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
collections of ſuch as favour them, and
the private Benevolence of particular Friends,
either in the Citty or Country, have been
duely converted to their beſt advantage: And
except the inconveniences which accompany
a long and throng impriſonment, they have
wanted nothing which moderate men could
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34673:6"/>
deſire. But <hi>an 100 are dead, and 200 more
are ſick.</hi> Let it be admitted, can the moſt
carefull Governers keep ſickneſſe out of their
Camps? If it were but out of a provident cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection,
for the ſafety of the Citty and
ourſelves, we had reaſon to uſe all our beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
to keep contagious diſeaſes from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them. This aſperſion is rather caſt upon
Almighty God, then any way concernes us,
unleſſe he could ſhew in particular, wherein
the Officers have failed in doing their duties.
To prevent all occaſion of infection, they have
been d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vided as much as poſſibly could be;
Diverſe of the Officers and ſome others are
lodged in the Citty, ſome in <hi>Davy Hall,</hi> ſome
in <hi>Merchants Hall,</hi> places of good receit, ſome
in private Houſes, and ſundry of them are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to walke up and downe the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
with a Keeper. The common Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in the Caſtle have the Liberty of
the Caſtle, where they walke all Day
long at their pleaſure, and at Night lye in
the great Hall, free both from Wind and
Raine. Now to cenſure Mens intentions,
upon probable Surmiſes, is raſhneſſe, to doe it
againſt ſuch apparent light, is farre from thoſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34673:6"/>
               <hi>Rules of Chriſtian Charity</hi> which he pretends.
If the Death of theſe Priſoners muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to any man, to whom rather then to the
Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> himſelfe? who drew them into
their Rebellious courſes, who hath neglected
them in their diſtreſſe, and now when he hath
meanes to redeem them, ſeems to urge the
ſickneſſe of ſome of them, rather as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Diſcourteſy towards us, then of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
unto them; as if he meaſured his favours
not according to their paſſed ſervice, but his
preſent uſe. The ground of this heavy Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
followes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which doth more evidently appeare, in that I
have often offered exchange of Priſoners taken at</hi>
Wakefield <hi>and other Places, for Redemption of
thoſe taken at</hi> Sea-Croft <hi>and elſewhere</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Firſt,
the evidence is not ſufficient to prove his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
He that ſhall bind the hands of a Phrene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
man, or reſtrein Perſons who are wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bent to hurt themſelves or others, is not
preſently guilty of an <hi>intention to deſtroy them,</hi>
ſince it argues much more probably a deſire to
ſave them. Secondly, an <hi>Exchange</hi> of Man for
Man by the Poll, is not alwayes <hi>an equall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi>
according to a true <hi>Geometricall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:34673:7"/>
if the one have a more conſiderable
Eſtate then the other: yet ſuch Exchanges as
theſe, we have either been neceſſitated to
make with his Lordſhip, or to have none at all.
Thirdly, a great part of this mortallity was
paſt, before <hi>Wakefield</hi> was ſo accidentally and
unfortunately loſt; ſo as his Lordſhips offer
came late, and unſeaſonably, even by his own
Confeſſion. But leaving all theſe advantages,
the very truth is this, The Lord <hi>Fairefax</hi> did
once condiſcend to a Treaty, before the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
of <hi>Wakefield,</hi> about the Redemption of
the <hi>Sea-Croft</hi> Priſoners: but whether it was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
or onely feined and fraudulent, to caſt a
Miſt before our eyes, untill he got his ends on
<hi>Wakefield,</hi> Let all the World Judge by the true
Relation of it. The Perſons appointed to treat
for us, were M. <hi>Stanhop</hi> and M. <hi>Nevill;</hi> and for
them M. <hi>Lambert</hi> and one M <hi>Robinſon,</hi> The
place named for the Treaty, was <hi>Kippax,</hi> The
time <hi>Whitſun-even.</hi> But the very Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the meeting (no ſooner) he ſent on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to forbid it, taking ſome ſleight exception
to the place, and deſiring that <hi>Temple New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom</hi>
might be named for it; and more to the
Perſons, alleging that M. <hi>Lambert</hi> and M.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34673:7"/>
               <hi>Robinſon</hi> were Souldiers, but M. <hi>Stanhop</hi> and
M. <hi>Nevill</hi> were none, and by conſequence
knew not how to eſtimate Souldiers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their true worth, deſiring that two
Souldiers might be named in their roomes.
Which exception is ſo groſſely and palpably
frivolous in every mans judgment that knows
both parties, that it argues ſtrongly, that the
Treaty was nou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hed not heartily or <hi>bona fide,</hi>
but craftily for private advantage: for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
night following they ſet forward toward
<hi>Wakefield,</hi> and ſurpriſed it on <hi>Whitſunday,</hi> early
in the morning. But both before and ſince the
ſaid Treaty, it hath been my deſire to have the
Priſoners exchanged or redeemed. To which
purpoſe (I muſt be his Remembrancer) ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Propoſitions have been made unto him,
both before this Mortallity fell among them,
and ſince: as to deliver three hundred of them
for three Men, Sir <hi>John Goodricke,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas
Danby,</hi> and Major <hi>Hiliard;</hi> but it was refuſed.
After this Sir <hi>Thomas Glemham</hi> offered the
Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> to releaſe man for man, to bring
the ſick Priſoners in Carts or on Horſeback,
and to deliver them two miles from <hi>Tadca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
in the midde way between <hi>Yorke</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34673:8"/>
               <hi>Leeds,</hi> attended onely with one Troope of
Horſe, if the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> would do the like,
The Troopes not to come within a quarter
of a Mile each of other, but Officers to be
appointed on either ſide to receive the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and the Lord <hi>Fairefax</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas
Glemham</hi> to ingage their words reſpectively
each to other, that no interruption ſhould be
given to either party, going or returning: but
this offer alſo was rejected as the former, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
they might be delivered at <hi>Kippax,</hi> the
place formerly refuſed by himſelfe. And laſtly,
after Generall <hi>Goring</hi> was taken Priſoner,
there was a Propoſition made to deliver the
whole 700 upon very favourable terms, ſo as
the delivery of Generall <hi>Goring,</hi> might be
treated of and concluded at the ſame time:
but that was ſleighted alſo. By all which it
is as clear as the Sun, that the Priſoners have
had as faire Accommodation from us, as we
could poſſibly afford, or their condition could
expect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they may thanke the Lord
<hi>Fairfax,</hi> and none but the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> and
his Counſellers, for their long durance; that
the ſubdolous Arts, the nice exceptions, the
frivolous pretenſes, and the menacing lines of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34673:8"/>
him or his Counſellers, have been and ſtill
are the ſole and proper cauſe, under Gods juſt
judgement of their deaths, who either have
been or ſhall be ſwept away in this Mortallity
which is fallen among them: yet he is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to impute it to the Lord <hi>Goring</hi> and
others. So it followes in his Declaration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which is refuſed and oppoſed by the Lord</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe
<hi>and other Perſons in that Army.</hi> I ſpeake
upon good aſſurance, the Lord <hi>Goring</hi> never
interpoſed in this matter untill his Sonnes
ſickneſſe, and then he was a Furtherer and
Promoter of theſe Priſoners Liberty, untill
the Lord <hi>Fairefax</hi> by his threatning and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable
expreſſions in a Letter yet extant,
<hi>(that ſuch as took and deteined thoſe Priſoners, did
run an hazard of their Lifes and fortunes,)</hi> had
awakened him to a juſt conſideration of His
Majeſties Honour and advantage. And ſince
his Sons inpriſonment, he hath been an earneſt
Mover for a faire Treaty. If he ſeeke to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
his Sonne therein, if he judge it une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
that all the Priſoners be reſtored to their
Liberty, and he onely who tooke them Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
remaine in ſtrict Cuſtody, who can blame
him? the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> confeſſeth in one of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34673:9"/>
his Letters, that when an offer was made to him
for the exchange of theſe Priſoners, he did on
purpoſe delay it for foure or five dayes, to trye
if in the meane time he could procure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing
of ſome of his Superiour Officers. The
caſe is the very ſame, and his Officers had no
ſuch neare relation to him, as ſuch a Sonne to
ſuch a Father. But if the Lord <hi>Gorings</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
be pertinaciouſly oppoſed, he is confident
in the goodneſſe of Almighty God and the
ſucceſſe of his Royall Maſter, that <hi>Deliverance
ſhall ariſe</hi> ſhortly to his Sonne <hi>by another meanes.</hi>
So from the <hi>Seacroft</hi> Priſoners he proceeds to
Captain <hi>Fairfax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for as much alſo as Captain</hi> Fairfax <hi>and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Commanders of</hi> Rotheram <hi>and thoſe parts,
having by Treaty their Liberty promiſed before
they yeelded up the place, are not withſtanding
made Priſoners, contrary to right and the Law of
Arms.</hi> I have ſhewed before that neither he,
nor any of his pretended Captains in this
Warr, can challenge any intereſt in the Law of
Arms, yet nevertheleſſe whatſoever was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to any of them, either by my ſelfe, or by
any Perſon by me truſted, ſhal be really and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
performed, ſo ſoon as it ſhall be made
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34673:9"/>
to appear that it was promiſed. There was a
Treaty indeed, and almoſt a concluſion, but
broken off by themſelves, and afterward the
Town delivered up by the Commiſſioners or
Deputies named and truſted by the Town to
negotiate for them, (who were all deſirous to
return to their Loyalty and Obedience,) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the reluctation of Captaine
<hi>Fairfax</hi> aud the other Captaines. Am I bound
to make good all thoſe Covenants which
themſelves deſerted? <hi>Praeſta mihi omnia eadem,</hi>
&amp; <hi>idem ſum.</hi> This being the caſe, they might
all have been deteined, without breach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.
Yet Captain <hi>Fairfax</hi> was permitted to
to go to the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> upon his own word
to return, and hath been uſed with as much
Freedome and Courteſie as he can deſire; the
others were ſtayed not for the buſineſſe of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theram,</hi>
but for the contribution towards the
charge of the Warre which themſelves had
helped to raiſe, as was expreſly concluded in
the Treaty of <hi>Rotheram,</hi> if it had ſucceeded:
and that with ſo much Courteſy and Reſpect,
that the Principall of them M. <hi>Weſtby</hi> is fairly
ſlipped away. And to let the World ſee how
unwilling I am to come near the brinke of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34673:10"/>
promiſe-breaking, or within the ſuſpition of it,
I have given order for Captain <hi>Fairfax</hi> his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
He proceeds</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Captain</hi> Reynolds, <hi>Captaine</hi> Fulthorpe, <hi>M.</hi>
Dalton, <hi>and M.</hi> Lilburne <hi>being all Men of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
are all thrown into Dungeons, and there kept
in moſt miſerable aud inhumane durance.</hi> Thus he
buſieth himſelfe to hunt after pretenſes, what
are theſe fower to him? two of them being
<hi>Biſhopricke</hi> Men, the other two ſerving under
another command: unleſſe he be the Generall
Superintendent of the <hi>North,</hi> as he would be
the Generall of the Northern Forces. But
let us examine it. <hi>All thrown into Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and there kept in moſt Miſerable and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
Durance;</hi> Very high expreſſions: and
all this to be publiſhed to the World, by the
Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> in a Declaration under his hand,
and ſcarce one word of it to be true <hi>ſub modo,</hi>
as it is related? He that was the Penner of this
paſſage needs not paint a Cypreſſe Tree, to
move his Spectators to pitty. Surely the Lord
<hi>Fairfax</hi> will never more give credit to thoſe
Informers, who ſuggeſted this unto him. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein
<hi>Fulthorpe</hi> and M. <hi>Lilburne</hi> have the beſt
chamber in the Caſtle to themſelves. Captein
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34673:10"/>
               <hi>Reynolds</hi> and M. <hi>Dalton</hi> are in the Sommer
Hall, with another Gentleman one M. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable,</hi>
a priſoner for debt: And they three have
that long Roome to themſelves, where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
above thrice three Debters have been
kept. The two former have the Freedome of
the Caſtle, The two latter are indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreined
and upon juſt grounds: <hi>Dalton</hi> for
preaching openly Sedition and Rebellion to
the priſoners, and <hi>Reynolds</hi> for ſeconding him
in it.</p>
            <p>His laſt charge is about Doctor <hi>Baſtwick</hi>
and Captaine <hi>Ludlow. And alſo that Doctor</hi>
Baſtwick <hi>and Captain</hi> Ludlow <hi>are made cloſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
and all conveniences for their health denyed
to them, inſomnch as all the Gentlemen aforeſaid
are like to periſh, through thoſe unuſuall tortures
and durances, which they ſuffer in their Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment
at</hi> York. Tortures and unuſuall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
who inflicteth them? when? upon whom?
Falſhood alwayes loves to goe masked in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralities.
Neither are thoſe two Priſoners
any thing to him at all, except his Chriſtian
Charity which is ſo cold to his Neighbours, do
glow toward ſtrangers. When Doctor <hi>Baſtwick</hi>
&amp; Captain <hi>Ludlow</hi> were firſt committed to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34673:11"/>
Caſtle of <hi>York,</hi> they had all the Liberty which
that place could afford and much better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
then they deſerved; I beleeve as
good as the beſt Doctors in the Kingdom, who
are now in the cuſtody of the other party doe
find. And in this ſtate they might have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
if a Malignant heart, an envious eye, and
an inveterate rancour againſt Soveraignty, had
not incited them to broach peſtilent principles
to make their Chamber a Schoole of errour, a
poyſoned Fountain to infect the minds of His
Majeſties Subjects, with Schiſmaticall and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
opinions. And yet for all this, they
were not ſo reſtrained, but that they had two
h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es allowed each day, to walk abroad with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the precinct's of the Caſtle, for their health
and recreation; untill their Letters were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
forty Miles from <hi>Yorke,</hi> brimme-full of
prodigious Treaſon againſt the Perſon of His
Sacred Majeſty, and by them acknowledged to
Sir <hi>Thomas Glemhan</hi> to be their own hands, and
mainteined, <hi>That they would Seale the ſame with
their Bloods.</hi> Then as it was high time they
were confined to their lodging, an eaſie puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for ſuch an exorbitant crime. Who will
ſuffer a ſcabb'd ſheep to mingle with his Flock?
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34673:11"/>
We uſe to ſhut up the doores of perſons infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with the Plague, without any breach of
the Liberty of the Subject. If a Papiſt doe but
attempt to ſeduce any of His Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
it is death by our Law. And it is true,
That being in this condition, of late they both
fell ſick, not of a Conſumption out of Griefe,
or for want of neceſſary ſuſtenance, but of an
hot Feaver, whereof <hi>Ludlow</hi> is dead, and <hi>Baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke</hi>
is upon his recovery, God give him grace
to amend his manners. But that corollary
which follows, <hi>That all conveniences for their
health are denied them,</hi> was forged in the ſame
ſhop with the reſt of the Declaration. For they
have had both their Medicines and Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to attend them, what and whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired;
and their Divine to give them Ghoſtly
Counſaile and comfort, and all other expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
which they did requeſt. If that truth
which they cry for in Religion, be of the ſame
ſtampe with their morall truths, God deliver
all good Chriſtians from it.</p>
            <p>In the cloſe of his Paper he intimates the like
hard meaſure to our Priſoners taken at <hi>Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi>
who as he ſaith have hitherto been uſed
with all humanity and civility. I hope that to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34673:12"/>
crowd them together into filthy and
worſe then <hi>Augean</hi> Stables, is no part of
this civility. I hope that to choke them with
the fumes of their own ordure, and to bury
them alive in ſubterraneous Cellars, is no part
of this humanity: where they cannot behold
the light of Heaven but through a little grate
of two ſpans breadth: and this onely becauſe
they remember their Duties, Oaths, Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to His Majeſty, better then themſelves.
But I delight not in recriminations.</p>
            <p>By this we may conjecture in part, what is
the true ſcope of this Declaration, to caſt an
aſperſion upon His Majeſties Officers, to lead
the Friends of the ſick Priſoners into a fooles
Paradiſe in expectation of ſome miraculous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
to remove from himſelfe the blame
and envy of their long durance, as if he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
an exchange but we ſtopped it, and laſtly,
to excuſe the hard and unhumane uſage of our
Priſoners in his Army. But to unmaske him: I
do heereby declare to all the world, that I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have been, and ſtill am ready to entertein
a faire Treaty about the Priſoners. And now
at laſt his Lordſhip may doe well to keep an
audit with his own Conſcience and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34673:12"/>
to take notice of that deluge of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
and miſeries which he hath brought
upon this County, and made his native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
a field or ſtage of blood, as if the Liberty
of the Subject did conſiſt in a Liberty, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
licentiouſneſſe for them to doe what they
liſt, and to compell all others that are not
of their Faction to ſuffer what they liſt.
He may doe well to conſider, That theſe
men whom he impriſons are free men born, and
fellow Subjects with himſelfe, and with them
from whom he pretends to derive his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
That God and their King will expect a
ſevere account of it; That the empty name &amp;
ſpurious title of <hi>Generall of the Northern Forces
for King and Parliament,</hi> contrary to the light of
reaſon, contrary to the plain Law of the Land,
much more irregular and exorbitant then the
moſt pernicious Preſidents of the worſt times
which ever <hi>England</hi> groaned under, will be no
ſatisfactory plea for ſo many lifes, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Soules as have periſhed, and are like to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
in this unnaturall Rebellion; That when
his guilt is elevated to the higheſt, the <hi>Cataſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe</hi>
(without timely prevention) will be the
utter ruine of him and his Adherents. And his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34673:13"/>
ſeduced Followers may doe well alſo to open
their eyes, and conſider at how dear a rate hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
they have purchaſed nothing but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
with the ruine of ſo many Eſtates,
the effuſion of ſo much blood, the perill of ſo
many Soules, taken away in actuall Rebellion,
without knowing either what they deſire, or
what they fear, without one Text of Scripture
or one particle of Law to warrant their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
being meerly led by the perſwaſions of the
Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> and their ſeditious Preachers, ſo
much as in them is, to overthrow what they
deſire to build up, the Proteſtant Religion,
the Law of the Land, the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
That a timely ſubmiſſion is their only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy;
That if they ſtill continue their deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
courſes, His Majeſty and His Servants are
guiltleſſe, and they may blame themſelves for
all thoſe Miſchiefes which fall upon their
