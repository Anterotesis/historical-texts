            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO The Right Honourable, the Countesse of <hi>Leycester</hi> widow, <hi>all health and happinesse of soule and body</hi> from Christ our Lord, both now <hi>and for euer.</hi>

               <salute>Right Honourable,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AFter many Children (Bookes I meane) which are a fruite that springeth out of wit (as out of a wombe) eleuen in number, which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me in the few and euill dayes of my pilgrimage; hee hath now at length of his goodnesse, added vnto them a twelfth (a <hi>Beniamin)</hi> like the twelue sonnes of <hi>Iacob:</hi> It is my last and youngest child, begotten and brought forth in my old age, being fast for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the yeeres of a man.</p>
            <p>In naturall generation, the first borne <hi>(Reuben-like)</hi> is the beginning of Parents strength, the excellency of dignity,
<pb facs="tcp:3215:3"/>
and the excellency of power; <hi>Gen. 49. 3.</hi> But it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in this spirituall birth, where the first that come into the Christian World, (by weakenesse of iudgement in the parents, and want of yeeres and experience) they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the feeblest and vnworthiest; those prouing most strong and excellent which be last borne. Good Madam, I could wish that I might so speake of this my <hi>Beniamin,</hi> the sonne of my right hand, and of my old age; and surely I haue some little reason to hope it will proue so: (pardon the ouermuch indulgence of a father, euen holy <hi>Dauid</hi> could ouer fancy <hi>Adoniah</hi> his childe, and good <hi>Elie</hi> could ouerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew two not good sonnes) because this is the off spring and issue that proceeded from me in the greatest infirmity of my body, but in the best strength of my mind; when I had in an ancient City, and a great people for the space of thirty foure yeeres and aboue, beene exercised in my Ministery from Sabboth to Sabboth; so as I may trust this Treatise wil haue more perfection then his brethren. Which howsoeuer it may proue for manner of handling, yet hereof I am well perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the matter and argument is most worthy and weighty; for it is about our holy and effectuall calling, to our celestiall and eternall King, by the Ministery of the Gospell; which is the beginning and first step into the state of grace, after wee are entred into this elementary world, and our most excellent dignity therein. As <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great acknowledged, that to be a true Christian by diuine voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was more esteemed of him then his Crowne and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which are corruptible; the other being vncorruptible and neuer perishing, as the worke of Gods exceeding great power, wherein he vttered no lesse strength and might, then in the creation of the World, or in the resurrection of Christ from the dead; <hi>Ephe. I. Verse 19, 20.</hi> For in this worke
<pb facs="tcp:3215:3"/>
of effectuall calling, the Elect being by nature dead, corrupt and blind in minde, peruerse in their will and affections, are by a wonderfull force (yet sweetely and with delight) drawne to the life of faith, being enabled to see Christ, and to loue and obey him as their Sauiour, calling them out of darkenesse into his maruellous light.</p>
            <p>The reasons mouing me to single out your Honour from among many both honourable and worthy friends of all rankes, vnto whom I might dedicate this Christian Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, are two. First, the report of your true calling to Christ, and of your sound loue &amp; obedience to your caller, and great affection ye beare to all about you, called to be Saints, both faithfull Ministers and Christians. Secondly, for that ye haue been the chiefe instrument vnder God, to call my eldest sonne to be the first that euer actually enioyed that great exhibition, a good while sithence giuen by your right noble and most honourable Husband, the Earle of <hi>Leycester,</hi> for the maintenance of two Schollars for euer in the Vniuersity Colledge at <hi>Oxford:</hi> for the which, if I should not euery way as I am able, shew my selfe thankefull to your Honour, I should be most vnworthy of such a benefit, being so freely conferred vpon one vnknowne to your Honour. The daily prayers of my Family, which are all the better for this good turne, both haue beene, and shall be offered vp vnto God the Father, through Christ his Sonne, for his gracious and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull guiding and keeping of your Honour in his comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and holy seruice and feare for euermore; <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>RIght worshipfull, the maine and chiefe vse to be made of this Booke or Treatise, it is to direct (as by an hand) euery Christian, which of all other things is most carefull of his owne saluation, how to iudge and discerne of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, whether hee haue any part in that sauing holy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling which bringeth to Christ, by such gifts of the Spirit as be peculiar to persons effectually called. The cause is not better knowne by the effect, or a tree by the fruite, then a true calling by the Gospell is manifested by such graces as doe accompany it in all the faithfull, necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but not equally; as the good fruits of a good tree be some bigger, some lesser. And lest any should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in iudging themselues (for likenesse is the mother of errour, which makes copper &amp; other glittering things to be sometime taken for gold) I haue therefore in the passage of this Booke discouered such things as be like vnto the true workes of grace, and are but the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fets and images of them. Now the same causes which induced mee to dedicate this tract and Christian Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
<pb facs="tcp:3215:5"/>
primarily to that most Honorable Christian La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, my Sonnes Benefactor in the Vniuersity Colledge at <hi>Oxford,</hi> excited and moued me likewise to ioyne you three to her in a secondary Dedication, as hauing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the grace of Christ obtained like precious faith in your heauenly calling, thorow the blessed Gospell; and being by Gods prouidence stirred vp to be the meanes of my sonnes preferment, both to his place, and in his learning. The first motion to this good exhibition, (which he partly hath to the great ease of my charge, and wholly I trust shall enioy by your fauourable fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance) began at <hi>Canterbury</hi> by you Madam, and was seconded and holpen forward at <hi>Oxford</hi> by you, the worthy Master of that Colledge where my sonne is Student; and finally, perfected by that Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Countesse, Widow to the founder her most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Husband the Earle of <hi>Leycester,</hi> long since deceased. Accept I humbly pray you this poore testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of my thankfull minde (who daily mention you in my prayers, that all sauing blessings may be powred on you, and continued to you) till my sonne through Gods mercy prospering in his studies, may expresse a morefull measure of a gratefull mind vnto you all, to whom he hath beene, and may yet be so much boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; which the Lord of his fauour in his good time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him well to performe.

            <head>An Aduertisement vnto the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>COurteous and Christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; there bee foure seuerall things which I purposed to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in this whole Dialogue &amp; Treatise. First, for the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to deliuer so neere as my iudgement could attaine, all those workes of the Spirit, euen in their particulars, which are peculiar vnto Gods elect children, who liue to be partakers of an outward effectuall Calling: that when the manifold riches of Christ his grace should be in some sort discouered and laide foorth to their eye to view and looke vpon them, it might stir them vp to a marueilous loue and thankefulnesse towards him, who hath called them to such riches &amp; honour: Also, that finding themselues endued and blessed with such graces as they shall learn from the Word, to belong onely to the chosen of God, it may settle
<pb facs="tcp:3215:6"/>
them in the perswasion and full assurance of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection to life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, for the Manner: Because euerie one of the workes of Christ in his elect, hath his counterfet in the reprobate, which liue in the Church, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take onely in a generall vocation; therefore I haue somewhat endeauoured to descry what the truth of euerie grace wrought in Gods Children, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer it from that apparence and shadow which an Hypocrite hath of the same grace; for this purpose, that whether the godly Reader would proue himselfe and make triall of his owne sincerity, either in the whole worke of Christianity, or in some special part or duty thereof, heere he may find what may further him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, for the Order, I haue followed so precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly, as euer my skill would direct mee; that very order of causes in this whole Treatise, which God himselfe doth keepe, in the bestowing and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the graces, propounding them to the Reader to be considered, as they haue necessary and naturall coherence one with another, and dependance one vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another; setting causes afore effects, and giuing cheefe place to the principall effects. By this meanes the carefull Christian in the search of himselfe, shall by effects be able to finde out causes, the roote by the
<pb facs="tcp:3215:6"/>
fruites, and how to value each grace and fruite, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his proper worth. Also, the Conscionable Minister, which hath not (as yet) thought vpon such an order, and shall approue of this as good &amp; sound, may in his teaching helpe himselfe to deliuer such things first, as by order of nature ought to haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency, for the better edification of their hearers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, as touching the Persons for whose sake I wrote this Dialogue; I meant it, though not onely, yet cheefly for the godly vnlettered Christians, to further them in this knowledge, how to examine their owne estate before God. As for the more Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they can helpe themselues in this part of our Christian science: or else may fetch direction from other manner of Lights then mine. Whatsoeuer it is that I haue performed, I pray thee good Reader take it in good part, make thy profit of it, and praise God for all. Farewell.</hi>

                  <p>But for such elect as are of discretion and yeares, the<note place="margin">Outward and inward.</note> Spirit in them worketh by the outward preaching of the word, calling them preparatiuely by the preaching of the Law, therein shewing them their sinnes, and iust<note place="margin">Law.

And this is their effectuall calling, which is nothing els but a making vs to be that which we were not, as the Apostle sayth, Rom. 4, 17. <hi>God calleth those things which are not, as though they were.</hi> Whereby it appeareth to be a very easie thing for the mighty God, to call and draw vs to his Son, euen as easie as for vs to speake a word, and to call one to vs.</p>
                  <p>Some are called sooner, and some later, as GOD in<note place="margin">The time of Calling.</note> his eternall counsell hath ordained the time of euerie ones calling: which is shadowed somewhat vnto vs, in the parable of the Husbandman, calling to work in his vineyard, some at the third houre of the day, others at the sixt, and others at the ninth, yea and some at the eleuenth, Math. 20, 1, 2, 3.

                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 6.</note> were called in their childhoode. For, of the one it is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 1.</note> of him, that he knew the Scriptures of a child, &amp;

Lastly, wee reade of one whom Iesus called at the last houre of the day, to wit, the theefe conuerted at his death: but only one such we reade of, least any presume; yet one, least any which are long vncalled, should despaire.</p>

I say the reason why his banquetting Hall is furnished with such meane guests, as the halt, the maymed, the poore; that is, the despised of the world, it is euen because they which be called and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, hauing nothing in themselues whereunto to attribute their owne conuersion, they may ascribe the whole glory and praise of it vnto the grace of Christ; who saw nothing in them, saue simplicity, meannesse, and basenesse, to moue him to preferre them afore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And on the other side, when any rich, noble,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3215:14"/>
or worldly wise, are powerfully changed and brought vnto God, to beleeue in him, and to become his true worshippers, they may vnderstand that it was no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward endowment of minde, or externall gift of body, or goods, but the meere loue of God in Christ that did all. In a word, that they may perceiue and confesse that they were borne againe, not of flesh and bloud, but of the will of God, because he was pleased to regenerate them, that the praise might be to him, as the worke was from him.</p>
                  <p>To this we may adde another reason, why the more simple and needy are more commonly drawne to Christ; because such being void of those goodly things wherein men vse to place their felicity, hauing the lesse to set their hearts vpon, they are the sooner and more easily brought to see their spirituall pouerty and want, and to seeke for the fulnesse of all good things, out of themselues in Christ Iesus, <hi>In whom are hid all the treasures of wisedome, and knowledge;</hi> Col. 2. 3. <hi>Of whose fulnesse we receiue grace for grace;</hi> Ioh. 1. 16: As being the most rich store-house of all heauenly goods; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom, whosoeuer are rich, they are but poore, and very fooles, whosoeuer are wise without him.</p>

Can they come out of a darke dungeon of ignorance, vnbeliefe, and sinne, wherein they were detained as prisoners in snares, and be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to liberty in freedome of minde and heart, to serue God, and not perceiue it? Is it possible, that they that were dead before, should liue, and doe the actions of a spirituall life; to mooue, and walke towards Heauen, but that this worke of the Spirit should be somewhat felt?

Therefore, howsoeuer at the instant of ones<note place="margin">Three times, wherein ones calling to Christ, hardly or not known</note> calling, haply a Christian may be so weake, such a babe in Christ; or in a strange, or strong fit or pang of temptation, when a quaume of soule affliction and trouble comes ouer the heart: or after some grosse and greeuous fall, (a man being as it were for a certaine time in a trance or extasie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3215:16"/>
which they alwayes lacked: as they, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 41. Which say; <hi>God is our Father.</hi> As men that dreame, doe fancy bagges of gold, and fulnesse of meate, being empty, poore, and hungry, when they awake: yet they who are in truth made partakers of this holy calling, in iudging themselues to be called, are therein no whit deceiued. <hi>For they haue a sure witnesse in themselues;</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>Yea, sundry witnesses;</hi> 1 Iohn 5. 8.</p>
                  <p>Whereas ye desire to heare the markes and meanes<note place="margin">Tokens of an effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> whereby Gods children are brought to the knowledge of their owne calling, beside that which in my former speech I haue let fall to that purpose, there be some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tokens, which I will now rehearse. The first is a spirit of discretion, enabling them to discerne the voice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of him who hath called them out of darkenesse into his maruellous light, according to that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; <hi>I am the good Shepheard, my Sheepe heare my voyce, the voyce of a stranger they wil not heare, but flie from him;</hi> Iohn 10. 5, 6. And a little after, <hi>I know mine, and am knowne of mine:</hi> Also, <hi>Ye haue an annointment from that</hi>
                     <note place="margin">There is a lie in doctrine &amp; religion, aswel as in life and manners, and that is two wayes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, either by heresie or hypocrisie.</note> 
                     <hi>Holy one, and know all things; yee know that no lie is of the truth:</hi> 1 Ioh. 2. 20, 21. Meaning hereby, that the truth of heauenly doctrine, by the illumination of the spirit, was in such cleere wise knowne vnto them, as they could distinguish it from a lie; putting a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene erroneous and sound teaching: euen as sheepe by naturall instinct, and partly by custome, can skill the whistle and call of their own Shepheard, euen so Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, after the grace of their calling, doe very well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the wholsome call and voyce of Christ, their heauenly and spirituall Shepheard, from the howling of Wolues, and call of Theeues and hirelings, which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3215:16"/>
speake not, but to deceiue and destroy. You will say<note place="margin">Ob.</note> peraduenture, that this token is common to the true Christian, with other who haue but an outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; yet by the light of their knowledge which they haue attained, can both bewray and conuince errour, euen whatsoeuer is contrary to the voyce of Christ. Yea, some of these are able very learnedly, and iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to doe it. Therefore we are to know that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit<note place="margin">Resp.</note> of discretion in such as be inwardly called, aswell as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> outwardly, is attended vpon by sundry other graces, as namely, with an hearty and vnsained loue of that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which they certainely know, and by power where of they were mightily called and changed; so as they willingly heare it, with a true &amp; constant delight in the vnderstanding of it, as it is written; <hi>My sheep heare</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 10. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>my voyce, and they which are of God, beare Gods word.</hi> That is, with much readinesse they heare it, and with great and sound pleasure in it: as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, <hi>I loue thy</hi>

                     <hi>Law, therein is my whole delight.</hi> Yea, they heare it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> with an obedient eare and dutifull, so as they can and doe so distinctly apply that which they heare &amp; know and loue, to their particular vses for humbling &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, for strengthening and reformation of themselues, as they submit gladly both iudgement and will, reason and affections, to the rule of this truth.

                  <p>I wil doe my best to satisfie you herein. Such as by want of the former markes, and other wayes doe but make doubt that as yet they haue not this merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full blessing of a peculiar calling: let them (vnder good hope of themselues that they are of the Elect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that to them God hath affoorded an outward calling, offering vnto them therein Christ with all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly treasures) neuer giue any rest to themselues, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till to their outward bee ioyned an inward calling, (which is so needfull, as till then men are in a very bad case:) applying themselues to the diligent and constant vse of all such helpes and meanes, as be profitable ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. Of these meanes some be priuate, some be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; the priuate meanes auaileable to an inward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,<note place="margin">Priuate means</note> be the often humbling of our lofty stubborne<note place="margin">Priuate feares, and confession of sinnes.</note> hearts, by a search into, and a confession of particular sinnes against the Law, vpon due and serious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them both: for the huge number being as the starres of Heauen, and for the fearefull filthinesse of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3215:17"/>
them, being against such an infinite diuine Iustice, &amp; an holy law; and lastly, for their deep &amp; dreadful danger, being the causes of al Christs passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; of eternal pains in hell fire, to such as they are not forgiuen vnto; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides innumerable iudgements and wofull plagues, within which they wrap vs, euen in this life. By the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<note place="margin">Note this wel</note> and carefull viewing our selues in the looking glasse of the Law, beholding there our most sinfull and most wofull estate, and labouring our selues to haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with some feeling experience of it, enforcing what we may, to apprehend with feare and griese the threatning of the Law against all and euery one of our sinnes; by this meanes our dolefull condition wil come before our eyes, for meekening and taking downe in some measure the hauty pride and obstinacy of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and will cast and strike vs into some dread of our selues, and be some bridle to keepe backe the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longnesse of our secure sinfull hearts. For it cannot, but that it will make a man affraide to run vpon such sinnes as he seeth, and confesseth against himselfe, and with his owne mouth pronounceth worthy of eternall wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednesse. And hauing once taken vp such a course of particular acknowledgement of our offences, after an earnest and diligent examination of our hearts and wayes; let it not be left againe, but continued with such care as men can, not to doe it of custome, but earnestly for humiliation.</p>
                  <p>Next thing is, there would be a good endeauour v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,<note place="margin">A bstayning from the act of sinne.</note> to auoide the outward act of all sinne, as to refraine from lewd and lasciuious talke, from lying, swearing, and from the deede of drunkennesse, adultery, theft, contention, fighting, and all such like; which is in a mans
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3215:18"/>
power to doe, if we will doe but so much as lyeth in vs to doe. The Heathens hauing attained thus much, as to liue ciuilly and vnblamably for their externall beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. Yea further, euen before their calling, men ought<note place="margin">3. Suppressing of inward lust.</note> by their endeauour &amp; watchfulnesse ouer themselues, not onely to forbeare the committing of any outward euill in word or deede, but further to snib and keepe downe the rebelling motions and desires of the soule. True it is, that they cannot so doe it as after they are called; when the Spirit of Christ hath put a power into them, for mortifying their lusts, in a true hatred and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring of them, as euils contrary to God, and their owne good: yet by the generall light of conscience, and helpe of restraining grace, they may sore checke and curbe them. And in this worke and exercise of suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing sinne, both in the outward fruit and inward roote, they shall not a little be furthered by embracing the company of good men, from whom they shall haue<note place="margin">4.

Also by eschewing the familiarity of vaine and euill men,<note place="margin">5.

Therefore of this in any wise, men that will come to an happy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, must take heede what manner of men they make the companions of their life: for such is the force of company, either good or euill, as one shall quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come such as they be, with whom hee doth associate himselfe; be then curteous to all, yet acquainted but with a few, and they of the best. It must not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3215:18"/>
that attentiue reading the Bible, and other good<note place="margin">6. Priuate rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> Books, which are wrote of diuine matters, especially of the nature and defect of sinne, of the Maiesty &amp; power of God, of his seuere iudgements against offenders of his Law, will doe great stead in this businesse. The Gospell and promises would be so farre tasted of, as may keepe vp the heart from sinking: for this grace of vocation is not giuen, but to such as the Law hath brought low by the sight of their sinnes, and wrath due vnto them. Adde vnto all the former, that not euill company alone, but whatsoeuer occasions of sinne by<note place="margin">7. Eschewing occasions of sinne.</note> place, persons, times, or things, must be taken heed of: for occasions being taken hold of, giue great strength to our sinfull nature; but being taken heed of, doe much pull it in. I would also counsell men sometime to faste, and refraine from meate and all pleasures of life; for at<note place="margin">8. Priuate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.</note> certaine fit times they can beare it; and alwayes to vse great temperance in meates and drinkes, and other law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full delights: but aboue all, thought and study must be had, that these priuate meanes be holpen by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like:<note place="margin">Publike meanes.</note> That men put themselues vnder a good Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, it being the principall instrument of our calling: for<note place="margin">1. Word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</note> howsoeuer the word of God read or preached, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the letters &amp; sillables, hath not any strength at all, nor the action of reading or preaching, as it is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by man, how well soeuer, they be as weake as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to this purpose of conuersion and calling: yet being both the good and holy ordinances of God, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come strong, because the God of strength and might worketh by them, yet in a seueral degree. For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth vs, that (ordinarily) it pleaseth God by preaching Christ, to <hi>saue such as beleeue;</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 21.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3215:19"/>
That is to say, both to begin their saluation by it, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them effectually out of their infidelity, making them to beleeue: Also, to build them vp further in their holy faith, and godlinesse of life, vntill they come to possesse fully saluation in Heauen. Hence it is, that the preaching of Christ crucified, is there, verse 18. termed the <hi>power of God to saue:</hi> that is, the powerfull instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which it pleaseth God mightily to worke, for the sauing of the Elect. Moreouer, we are taught in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15. that ordinarily we are not otherwise, (being of yeeres) brought to haue faith to beleeue in God, then by hearing such Preachers as be sent, and furnished from God with authority and gifts for that ende, as it is written: <hi>How shall they beleeue in him, except they doe heare? and how shall they heare except they preach? and how shall they preach, except they be sent?</hi> In the Acts of Apostles, Chap. 26. 18. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reporteth, that hee was called to this very ende, that by his preaching the Gospell, hee might <hi>open the eyes of the blinde, turne men from Satan to God, from darkenesse to light.</hi> Finally, to omit infinite authorities of Scripture, as <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 11, 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24, 25. and such like places, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes yoake or ioyne preaching and beleeuing, as cause and effect: <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 20, 21. and 14. 1. &amp;c. I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side reade of innumerable soules, euen by thousands at once, called to Christ, by the opening and application<note place="margin">Acts 2. 41, 47.</note> of the word. Albeit then we are to leaue to Christ, to engender &amp; encrease faith and sanctification by what meane he himselfe will; yet for our selues, we are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon such meanes, as wee find in the word to be ordained for such workes: and this is principally by preaching the word; that is, by a faithfull deliuery of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3215:19"/>
the sense of Scripture by the Scripture, with wise and<note place="margin">Nehe. 8, 8.</note> fit application of doctrines to exhortation, confutation, rebukes, comforts, threatnings, as it is written; <hi>He that prophecyeth, speaketh to men, to edification, to exhortation, to consolation:</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 3. In the 24, 25. verses of this<note place="margin">Prophecying here is put for interpretation of the will of God already reuealed: and not for foreshewing his will in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture euents.</note> Chapter, we may reade the mighty operation of this Ordinance of Christ, for begetting and confirmation of a liuely faith, most notably to be commended. <hi>If</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>all prophecie, and there commeth in one that beleeueth not, or is vnlearned: he is rebuked of all;</hi> and so are the secrets of his heart laide open, and so he will fall downe on his face, and worship God, and say plainely, that God is in you indeede. By this it is cleere, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with preaching, God coupleth his owne arme<note place="margin">Esay 53. V. I.</note> and power, both to enlighten the minde to see inward and secret corruption, hid from vs before, and to bow the heart to reuerence and obey God. As men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the health of their bodies, doe chuse places con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to dwell in, where there is wholsome ayre, sweete water, and other commodities; so they wil much more doe this duty to their soules, for the health and safety thereof; as to prouide for it good diet, by the wholsome preaching of the word ordinarily on the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boath:<note place="margin">1. Word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</note> which together with Catechizing, and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit<note place="margin">2 Catechizing.</note> of publike prayer and Sacraments, shall in Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed<note place="margin">3. Prayer.</note> houre effect this blessed worke of a true calling,<note place="margin">4 Sacraments.</note> to their present comfort, and euerlasting saluation of their soules. Where these meanes be not at all vsed, if so be they may be had, or some, and not all; or vsed negligently, or by fits and starts onely, there the case will goe hard. For howsoeuer our calling hath God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone for the Authour and beginner, the finisher also
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3215:20"/>
and perfiter of it; yet there is a necessity laide vpon vs, to serue the gracious prouidence of Almighty God (as instruments) therein, by attending and exercising the meanes appointed. Therefore as <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 27. hauing a warrant from God of good security, yet saide; <hi>If these Mariners doe not tarry in the Ship, we cannot be safe:</hi> so I may say (Gods ordinary dispensation considered) that if these meanes be cast off, and not cared for, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called. Now for such as be already called, and can finde in themselues the true markes thereof; as this is the greatest comfort in the World, so if they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue this comfort, then they must see to it, that such meanes as it pleased God to blesse vnto them at first, for the obtaining of an effectuall vocation and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; these very meanes they addict themselues vnto, vsing them still, and them all, if there be no necessary let; and being constant without being weary, in a right manner also, sincerely and humbly, with a feruent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Gods glory aboue all things, being much in prayer and godly meditations: and as euer they will be thankefull for such a grace as their effectuall calling is, let them striue to walke worthy of the vocation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are called, <hi>in all lowlinesse and meekenesse, long suffering and loue;</hi> Ephe. 4. 1, 2.</p>

forslowed to tell you, when ye asked me of the meanes<note place="margin">Sundry wayes of God in his calling men.</note> of calling, that it hath seemed good in the eyes of God, to call some immediately without any ministry of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels or Men, as <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, <hi>Abraham</hi> in Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,<note place="margin">1. Without meanes.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> in his iourney to <hi>Damascus;</hi> to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be most free not bound to the meanes, which are rather for vs then for God; who can without them pull a sinner out of the hell of his sinnes, into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of grace here, and of glory hereafter. Moreouer, in the means which God vseth to work a calling, there is to be marked a maruellous great simplicity, (especially<note place="margin">2 Weak means</note> now vnder the Gospell) far from worldly shew, pompe, and power; hauing committed the charge and commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of calling Kingdomes to the faith of the Gospell, vnto his twelue Apostles, who were men much remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the glittering glory of this World, being meane men, of low estate and condition here in earth, and vsing no other meanes to effect the conuersion of the people to God, then the preaching of the Gospell in all plainnesse, without all wisedome of words, and<note place="margin">Such as Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors would vse for often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> by feruent prayer with patient sufferings.

And hauing once planted Churches, and called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite men and women to God, by his simple Apostles, and other their like helpers, Euangelists and Prophets, it hath pleased Christ to haue his mystical body further builded vp, his Saints gathered, and the worke of the Ministery done, by Pastors and Teachers in the power
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3215:21"/>
of simple and euident demonstration of his truth. And to this ende he would haue this heauenly treasure put into such earthen vessels, that the power of calling, as it is of God, and not of men; so it might appeare and be knowne, and acknowledged so to be, to his owne<note place="margin">Cor. 4. 7.</note> eternall praise. Also, it would be further considered, that the most good God in his most wise and gracious<note place="margin">3.

Neither is it onely the will of God to vse some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times no meanes, or weake meanes, or vnlikely meanes; but sometimes euen quite contrary meanes, to helpe<note place="margin">4.

it selfe: Making some one grosse fall, or many grosse sinnes, which his chosen haue run into, and liued in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their calling, to be as a weight or plummet of lead to bring and keepe downe their proude hearts, and so<note place="margin">God giues grace to the humble.</note> to shame and terrifie their consciences; so as by that meanes there is a passage made for grace more easily to enter in them. Whereas otherwise, they would haue set to both their shoulders and their brest, to haue kept it out; if their fiercenesse and courage had not beene so danted and dismayed with the sight and horror of their owne manifold and monstrous iniquities. And suffer mee here to remember my selfe in one matter, that<note place="margin">Calling, a worke easie to God.</note> whereas I said to you before, that for God to draw one from sinne to Christ, is as easie as for vs to call one to vs, or to speake a word: I would haue ye to vnderstand it, in regard of the infinitenesse of his might, to which the greatest and hardest things to our sence and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are as easie as the least and slightest things. When he would create the World, there being no matter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent before, he needed but command, &amp; it was done; and that vnformed masse, out of which all creatures were hewen, being extant by his commandement, hee did no more but say, Let it be light, and out of it there presently sprang light; and so of all other things which he made, they were made by his word, without Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or trauell, euen as now they all consist by his word. It is right so in the conuersion and calling of a sinner. <hi>The dead in their sinnes, heare the voyce of the Son of God, and hearing, they liue:</hi> Ioh. 5. 25. And howsoeuer in this worke of new creation, there is not onely no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent matter to worke on, but an vtter repugnancy and rebellion in our nature, fighting and warring against
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3215:22"/>
God, being strengthened and armed with the whole power of Satan and the World; yet these many and mighty obstacles and hinderances, are without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty ouercome by him, to whom nothing is hard and vnpossible. In that he vseth such meanes (as wee haue spoken of) both for preparing to our calling, and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: yet it is not because he could not performe this worke by his very word onely, but because so it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him, and to enure vs to obedience. Howbeit for all<note place="margin">Calling, a work of Gods wonderfull power.</note> this, our calling is not to be helde a slight worke, as if I speake this any whit to lessen and diminish the credit and praise of Gods grace and power: but rather the more to extoll and magnifie them, in as much as our vocation to Christ, being a worke as glorious and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull as our creation of nothing is, if not more: and as the resurrection from the dead, which yet to the wise men of the world, those great Philosophers haue euer seemed things absurd and impossible: <hi>so as they haue scorned the doctrine of these things:</hi> Acts 17. 28, 29. May wee know, say they, what this new doctrine meaneth; and againe verse 32. when they heard of the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the dead, some mocked: yet in the calling of a sinner to faith in Christ, there being that exceeding greatnesse of diuine power set on worke, as was expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in raysing Iesus from the graue; see <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1. 19, 20. for all this to bring a wretched sinner held and lockt vp in the bolts and fetters of his lusts, captiuated to Satan, and vnder the power of that mighty Potentate; I say to bring such a one to know, beleeue in, &amp; to loue Christ, so easily as wee would call one to come to vs, or as it is to vtter a word, how doth this aduance the praise of Gods almighty grace; to which sinne, the world, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3215:22"/>
hell, doe quickly, though most vnwillingly yeelde. And here to shut vp this Treatise of calling, because I haue beene very troublesome by my long discourse of it, let me tell you, that this is a chiefe ende which God lookt<note place="margin">The endes of our calling.</note> vnto in the calling of sinners vnto repentance, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard<note place="margin">1.

To thee therefore the King euerlasting, immortall, inuisible, vnto God onely wise, be honour, and glory, for euer and euer, Amen.</p>

                  <p>I thanke ye for your willingnesse to enter into, and to continue this discourse. Also, I commend your good remembrance of these matters, it being so long since they were taught; but as you holpe your self in some thing that was almost slipt from you: so ye shal suffer mee to helpe you in that which I my selfe almost had, and as it seemeth ye haue altogether forgot. For by the closing of your speech, I perceiue that ye haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken what ye are minded to say of this argument: and yet that you were willing to speake of it what you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred; but I maruell not if some things are slid from you, I rather maruell (the frailety of our memory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing considered) that ye kept so many things There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnto all that which hath beene recorded by you, there be other foure points, which I will briefly adde.</p>
                  <p>First, touching the impulsiue &amp; mouing cause which inclineth God to the effectuall calling of some, whereas
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3215:23"/>
he passeth by othersome, which are no more vnworthy then such as are called, and haue the selfe same outward meanes, being all alike sinners and enemies to God by nature, and all equally partakers of the word and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie: yet some of them are left in their corruption, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being gathered to Christ. It was tolde ye, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth meerely of the purpose and good pleasure of God, which is made plaine by expresse authority of Scripture, which ioyneth Gods purpose and calling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; <hi>Euen to them that are called of his purpose:</hi> Rom. 8. 28. and affirmeth, that God hides those things from some, which he reueales to others; euen because so it pleaseth him: <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 26. there being no other reason of <hi>Peters</hi> calling, rather then <hi>Iudas,</hi> but this; it was his good pleasure. For seeing effectuall calling (as you well remembred) floweth from election, and is peculiar to the chosen; thereof it followeth, that that which makes the difference betweene some, who are otherwise alike in <hi>Adam,</hi> is the election of God, ordaining some to life, and so to the meanes in their calling to Christ, whereas others are refused: yet so refused in the counsell of God, as they make themselues vnworthy and vncapable of calling, by refusing willingly, and reiecting wilfully the voyce of Christ; shutting their eyes that they may not see, and their eares lest they should heare, and making fat their owne hearts, lest they should vnderstand; <hi>Acts</hi> 28, 27. Which sheweth thus much, that as the not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of some is iust, so the calling of othersome is most free, depending vpon the good pleasure of Gods will. This is such a matter, the consideration whereof, must moue Gods children by calling, to be very thankefull with great &amp; feruent loue towards God, for this happy
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3215:23"/>
worke: Sithens finding nothing in them at all, hee did fetch from himselfe the cause which moued him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale his Son in them by the Gospel; whereas he would not doe so to others, who were by creation as good as they, and by nature no worse: yet God to leaue others, &amp; to giue them ouer to their blindnesse; and to open to those the mystery of his will, and that according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ; how doth this deserue, that they should from the ground of their heart blesse God, the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, for this most gracious spirituall blessing?</p>
                  <p>The second thing vnmentioned by you, because vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, was this; that as amongst men Gods will puts a difference betwixt man &amp; man (as being all subiect to him as clay to the potter) caling these &amp; hardning these; so in those which are truly called, he keepeth not one te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: some of his elect childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen at the instant of their calling, being strong men in Christ, able to goe, walk, &amp; run; as <hi>Zacheus,</hi> which at his conuersion was filled with<note place="margin">Luke 19. 8.</note> ioy, &amp; power giuen him to shake off his great sins, &amp; to shake himself presently not only out of them, but out of his goods by restitution of ill gotten, &amp; contribution of the rest well gotten: which argueth a great measure and force of grace, there being sundry which long after their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersion can hardly ouercome themselues to doe that which <hi>Zacheus</hi> did at his new birth, the 1. hour he came into the world. The like is to be seen in <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle, who immediately vpon his calling &amp; coming out of the darknes of Iewish pharisaisme vnto the light of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anisme, and from Satan to God; he had such a portion of the strength of grace, as he could preach Christ, and was ready to suffer for him, being ready to the perill

of his life to teach them, whom hee had lately persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to death. Now there be others againe at the time of their calling, yea, and a good while after, which are so weake as young Babes, both for knowledge and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise; as appeareth in <hi>Peter,</hi> and in the other Apostles, who being called euen with a more peculiar calling to be the members of Christ, and not onely with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vocation to be the Ministers and Apostles of Christ; yet by the story of the Euangelist it doth plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that for a great while after, euen till the ascension of Christ, they were exceeding infirme both in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and affection, not knowing distinctly the meanes<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 32, 33, 34.</note> of their redemption to be Christs sufferings and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, though it were most plainely and often tolde them; and tripping and failing by pride and ambition, contention, and otherwise. Againe, some of his elect children at their first calling, are brought forth by their Mother the Church, with great paine and hazard to themselues, being before and about the time of their calling much afflicted, full offeares and anguishes, by reason of their manifold greeuous sinnes laide before them by their inward monitor, their conscience accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them, and the outward admonition and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Law; the light of Gods Iustice shining into their mindes, and striking them as lightning and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from Heauen. Thus it fared with the fore-named <hi>Paul</hi> at his conuersion, which was with trembing and astonishment; <hi>Acts 9. 6.</hi> As also with them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. whose soule-horrors, as daggers or kniues, pricked their hearts. Now on the other side, some there bee which at their first calling feele no such thing, but are deliuered from their bondage to Satan and sinne, with
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3215:25"/>
great case, nay, with maruellous ioy and alacrity osspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,<note place="margin">Who yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward haue their portion of godly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</note> as it is to be seene in <hi>Lydia; Acts</hi> 16. 15. who as one feeling nothing lesse then anguish, did cheerefully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine <hi>Paul</hi> vpon her new birth and calling. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritanes, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 9. at their conuersion by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of <hi>Philip,</hi> had great ioy; it being in this case, as in the naturall birth, where some come into this World with great facility, and others with very great danger: and according to this different proceeding of God in this worke, it is, that some of the Elect doe sooner and far more easily see their owne calling, then others doe. The consideration of this second point, is for comfort of them who being certainely called, yet are troubled that the strength of grace is so little, their infirmities so many, their ioy and cheerefulnesse very small; which should not so greeue them, if they would remember, that this case hath beene the condition of others; and withall, that the troubles and griefe which they finde in themselues by reason of their wants, doth argue and proue to them their owne conuersion to bee true and sound; which should more preuaile to comfort them, then the sight of any defect and weakenesse to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: let them reioyce in the truth of the grace, which cannot reioyce in great measure of grace.</p>
                  <p>The third thing which I adde, is this, that election necessarily bringeth forth a true calling to Christ, as a proper effect of it. Therefore all good Christians are by their calling, to iudge of their owne election, and consequently of their owne saluation: for as they must needes be saued which are elected, because God chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not, and nothing can hinder his purpose: so they are certainely elect, who be effectually called. It is not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3215:26"/>
then for any to search curiously into Gods counsel, and to begin there to find the assurance of their owne salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but wee are to begin at another end: and as wee discerne &amp; iudge of the roote by the fruite, of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by the water which runneth from it, and of the cause by the effect; so we must rise vp to the sight of our election, by the worke of our calling, which is an hand to conduct vs into Gods Counsel-house. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle hauing taught and established that heauenly doctrine of Predestination; (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. at the 24 verse) hoe declared that the witnesse of it is to be sought, not out of our selues in Gods secret will, (which is an obiect too excellent for our weake eyes directly to look vpon) but in our selues, to wit, in our vocation to be Gods people, which before were not his people. Also <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 37. it is laide downe as a note, whereby to know who be giuen to Christ of his Father in his eternall election, that such shall come vnto him and see him; <hi>All that the Father giueth me</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>shall come vnto me.</hi> Now this comming vnto him, is vpon their obedience vnto his call. To be short (for in a plaine matter, few proofes be best,) as Christ proued the Iewes, to whom then hee spake, not to be the elect sheepe, because they refused to heare his voyce, and to beleeue: so he describeth his sheepe which are chosen indeede, by this marke, that they heare, and follow. Wherefore, as in vaine they presume of their election, who neuer were called to faith in Christ; so whosoeuer by the due tokens which you before haue laide forth, and are about to doe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after when ye come to the effects of calling, shall finde their owne effectuall calling to be soundly and surely wrought; let them gather thereby vnfallibly their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3215:26"/>
to life. <hi>Be of good comfort</hi> (say the people vnto the blinde man in the Gospell) <hi>the Master calleth thee:</hi> so I say to these, take to ye good heart, for Christ the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster hath called you. Not more certainely by the rayes and beames doe ye know the Sunne to be a lightsome creature, then yee may determine of the loue of Gods gracious purpose towards you from euerlasting, by this fruit of it in your effectuall vocation by the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing omitted by you, it is this; that the times of calling being so vncertaine, wee should neuer cast away our hope of others, who doe liue vnder the meanes, though they liue wickedly, vnlesse God doe giue vs any apparent signe of their reiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from grace; as in <hi>

Therefore the Ministers of the word are still to be sowing, and casting abroade their seede early &amp; late, they know not which will take place, this, or that; the people still to approach to Gods house, to heare the word of God calling them. They cannot tel which shal be the houre of their calling; which as it cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented one minute, so being once come, all the strength of hell cannot holde them from obeying the voyce of their caller.</p>

In respect of time, there is not first and second; one before, another after: for it is not in this new creation, when this our little World of our selues is brought out of the world of sinne and vnbeliefe, vnto the Christian World of grace; as it was in the creation of the great World of Heauen and Earth, when the parts of that world were made one after another in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time, the worke being distinguished according to the number of dayes in the weeke: but here in this new creation, we haue the blessed sauing workes and graces of the holy Spirit powred into vs all at one instant. We are not at one time called, and at another time iustified, and at another time sanctified, and then receiue graces of hope, and loue, and wisedome, &amp;c. but these come as <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren came into AEgypt for Corne, all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: As the prodigall childe returning to his Father, did at once receiue all those fauours from his kinde Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of kisse, embracing, ring, robe, and charge to kill the fat Calfe. Indeede the sauing graces for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and growth to perfection, require succession of time; euen as Infants become not tall men, till after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeeres: but these graces at the beginning, and first begetting, (like grapes in a cluster) doe all come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Euen as it standeth with the naturall body in the quickning of it, the soule comming into it, giueth power of motion and sense to euery member at one instant; not to one sooner, to another later: so in our new birth, all the faculties of the minde and body, being before dead in trespasses and sinnes, are by grace (the soule of the soule) spiritually at once reuiued and enabled to all

The truth whereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in that <hi>Paul</hi> reports of the <hi>Romans;</hi> that being<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1, 2, 3.</note> made beleeuers, they were iustified: and being iustified by faith, they had withall other graces, as peace with God, hope of glory, ioy in that hope, sense of Gods loue.

                  <p>By that which hath beene spoken, I perceiue what order ye thinke to be kept of God, in the working the workes proper to the Elect. First, there is calling, in which there is, 2 illumination or opening of the eye. Thirdly, opening of the heart. Fourthly, liuely faith. Fiftly, vnion with Christ, or our incorporation into him. Sixtly, Iustification, or imputation of Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse. Seuenthly, peace of conscience, Eightly, Ioy in the holy Ghost. Ninthly, hope of glory. Tenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Sanctification. 11. Repentance, called our turning from sinne. 12. Loue of God. 13. Charity to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. 14. Patience in affliction. 15. Obedience to the will of God. Let me aske of these in order, what I am desirous to know, for my further instruction: and first touching illumination, where doe yee finde ground in Scripture for it? Then describe it, and shew what it is, and what kindes there be of it, and how the illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Elect, doth differ from the worke of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in illuminating some of the reprobate.</p>

                  <p>In the calling of a sinner to faith, there are two workes of the Spirit; The one, <hi>opening of their eyes:</hi> Acts 26. 18. The other, <hi>the opening of their hearts;</hi> Acts 16. 14. <hi>The Lord opened the heart of Lydea:</hi> the former is Illumination, or enlightning; whereof the holy Ghost speaketh in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>They which were once enlightened:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Opening the Eyes.</note> And <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 79. <hi>To giue great light to them that sit in darknesse.</hi> And againe, <hi>The people which sate in darknesse, saw great light:</hi> Mat. 4. 16. In respect of this worke of the Spirit, Christ is said to be <hi>the light of the Gentiles;</hi>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:3215:29"/>
Luke 2. 32. And the Ministers who are but Instruments of this worke, are called, <hi>Lights of this Word, and Lights of the blinde;</hi> Mat. 5. 14. Rom. 2. 19. This worke of il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination or enlightning, it is that, whereby the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit first purgeth the mind &amp; vnderstanding from darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and vanity, which was in it through ignorance of God; also, the iudgement from that peruerse corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, in things belonging to God; whereby it could not put a difference betweene good and euill: and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, putteth into the vnderstanding and iudgement a new light of knowledge and discretion, whereby the soule knoweth and discerneth aright the truth of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Christ, euen particularly in the seuerall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. This enlightning is twofold. The first is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and slight, whereby the minde is enlightened vnto an idle and vnfruitfull knowledge of God. The latter,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is a speciall and through-enlightening vnto a diligent and profitable vnderstanding of Christ.</p>
                  <p>These two kindes of knowledge, whereof the one a wicked man may haue, the other is giuen to none but to the Elect, though they both be the gifts of the Spirit, and also be of the same things, yet they differ very much. For first, the knowledge which a godly man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in his illumination, it is certaine and distinct; so as hee is able to applie the threatnings of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the humbling of himselfe and the promises of God to raise and comfort himselfe: the wicked by their knowledge cannot doe so, hauing but a naked and bare speculation, without any particular application of the same, for humbling or comfort.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the knowledge of the godly is sufficient to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> direct them generally, and in euery particular duty,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3215:30"/>
whether it be for auoyding euil, or for doing any good; but the insight and knowledge of the wicked is vnsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and vnable to direct them in their singular and particular actions, either for omission of euill, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of good. The former knowledge is full of good workes, and directs them in whom it is, to doe good things constantly; but the latter is barren, and fadeth before the end, or leaues them in the end.</p>
                  <p>In respect of these differences, the knowledge of the Elect for the cleerenesse, sufficiency, and certainty of it, is likened to the light of the Sunne; and the knowledge of the reprobates for the confusednesse, vnsufficiency, &amp; vnstablenesse, is compared to the Lightening, which doth not giue any certaine light, it doth not continue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny certaine time; and when it is gone, men see worse then before. So doth it fall out with the wicked, for their knowledge doth soone vanish, and while it lasteth it is very vncertaine; and there is in them afterwards greater and more dangerous darknesse then before: for because they winke with their eyes, and make their hearts fat, striuing willingly not to see that they cannot but see, wilfully blinding and hardening themselues; therefore as a punishment of this sinne, they are giuen ouer to haue dull and heauy eyes and eares, so as they shall <hi>see and not perceiue, heare, and not vnderstand; Acts</hi> 28. 27. Whereas the knowledge of the godly encreaseth in brightnesse like the Sunne, which <hi>shineth more &amp; more cleerely vnto the perfect day;</hi> Prou. 4. 18. So as the godly are very greatly bound to praise God for such their light of knowledge, and to endeauour to walke in that light; answering such a grace by thankfulnes in tongue, and obedience of liues and workes, as becommeth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3215:30"/>
of such light, translated out of such darknesse.</p>

                  <p>Now that ye haue spoken of illumination or opening the eyes, will it please you to say somewhat of the other worke of the Spirit, which ye call the opening of the heart; what may this signific, or how may it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the former worke of enlightening?</p>

                  <speaker>Apollos.</speaker>
                  <p>By the heart (according to Scripture phrase)<note place="margin">Opening the heart.</note> is signified not the fleshy part of the body, which is thought to be the fountaine of life, and seate of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; but the faculties of the soule, especially the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and will. For the heart is (as it were) the chaire of estate for the soule, where the soule sheweth her selfe in presence; therefore it is so often put for the soule, and the chiefe powers thereof; as, God opened <hi>Lydiaes</hi> heart, that is, her soule. Now this opening, sheweth and teacheth vs, that the soule is as a Chest fast lockt and barred, into which (while it is so) there can no treasure be put. So it is with the soule before our effectual calling, it is close shut vp, and lockt vp through ignorance and vnbeliefe &amp; sinne; so as no sauing grace can drop into it, but it is kept from all sight and feeling of Gods peculiar mercies. Therefore this opening of the heart, besides the illumination already spoken of, whereby the Spirit piercing into the minde, endued it with that heauenly light before touched, that it may cleerely and certainely vnderstand the whole truth of the Word, but chiefly the promise of the Gospel; it hath also the mouing and bowing of the will, with affection to receiue and embrace this promise; the Spirit enduing the soule with a sweete feeling of the most mercifull goodnesse of God therein. And of these two workes of the Spirit, in opening of the eyes and the heart, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3215:31"/>
that third worke, called Faith, which is a gift pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the soule, knitting it vnto Christ, with whom, being vnderstood and knowen as hee is reuealed in his Word, and embraced with affection both of the mind &amp; will, it now resteth satisfied, as one that hath found a rich treasure or great spoyle.</p>

                  <p>But I am not yet satisfied with this that you haue said, about these workes of the Spirit. Therefore I pray you yet more plainely and particularly lay forth the actions of the Spirit, tending to the engendring of faith in the heart of an elect sinner.</p>
                  <p>Herein I will doe mine endeauour to giue you satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: the Spirit of God (as in our first conference you<note place="margin">Spirit wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by the Law.</note> rightly told vs) worketh both by the Law and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. In the preaching of the law, it worketh first a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, as he is God the Creator and preseruer<note place="margin">1. A know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, as Creator.</note> of all things, reuealing his most great maiesty, power, iustice, and wisedome; making vs to see him a mighty &amp; terrible Iudge, extremely hating, and infinitely recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencing<note place="margin">2.

                     <hi>sinne is by the Law;</hi> Rom 3. 20. especially reuealing vnto vs, that the very first motions of our minde and will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, or our Neighbour, are damnable sinnes and <hi>breaches of Gods Law; Rom.</hi> 7. 7. Our sinnes being thus vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered vnto vs in the very particulars, as well actuall as originall, as well of omission as of commission, in our thoughts, words, and workes; whether they were little or great, against God or men: after this, there followes<note place="margin">4.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3215:31"/>
whereof, and haply by a sensible experience of<note place="margin">5.

Whereupon the saide spirit bringeth to a speciall griefe vpon the sence of Gods heauy wrath for some especial sinne, called, <hi>Pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi>
                     <note place="margin">6. Griefe.</note> 
                     <hi>of the heart;</hi> Acts 2. 37. whereby it bereaueth men of their chiefe desires, putteth them out of conceit with the best things in themselues, turning their mirth to mourning, their chiefe delight to bitter griefe: taking downe their hearts courage, and stomack; because they<note place="margin">7. Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting downe the heart.</note> see they haue to doe with a righteous &amp; most rigorous Iudge, who will remit nothing of his iustice, but taketh reuenge vpon all sinne and iniquities: and finding no strength or meanes in themselues to escape his wrath, they despaire of euer obtaining his fauour, by any their<note place="margin">8.

They are called, <hi>the rebuking of the world of sinne.</hi> Here the office of the Law ceasseth, and can bring no neerer to Christ, but onely to bewray vnto vs our great neede and want of his sufferings &amp; righteousnesse: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Law is termed our <hi>Schoole-master to Christ;</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. 3. 24.

I will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised what I promise, but hauing once giuen my faith, I will not breake it willingly. Fidelity in keeping pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise with men, is one of those Christian graces which are proper to Gods children, as there will be occasion hereafter to declare: but in the meane time, the thing that wee are now to deale in, it is not concerning ciuill faith betweene man and man, but about Christian faith in the promises which God hath made to man. Which because it is a large theame, and wil take vp much time, I haue purposely set apart some, and ouercome other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some businesse, that wee might intend the through-sif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this point.</p>

                  <p>And my leysure doth serue mee very well. Therefore because you thought it no ease vnto you to propound Questions, ye shall now vndergoe the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of an answer, which you liked so well of. Let me see how you proue that Faith is a fruite of our calling, and a gift proper to the Elect; seeing it is reported of many, that they haue beleeued, which yet were not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, as of <hi>Simon Magus; Actes</hi> 8. 13. Also some in <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 23, 24. Yea, of the very Diuels that they doe beleeue; <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 19. In which place verse 26. the same Apostle telleth vs of a dead faith, which one may haue, and yet be no true Christian.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Aquila.</speaker>
                  <p>For your former Question, whether it be a fruite of our effectuall Calling: If there were no euident testimony to proue it, yet the thing is plaine enough; for all know (which know any thing) that in our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wee are made to beleeue, this being the very <hi>terminus,</hi> or end, wherein the worke of our Calling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3215:33"/>
to bring vs to Faith in the Sonne of God. Of which yet there is proofe by expresse places, or good consequence out of holy Scripture. When the Apostle saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. <hi>Whom he calleth, them he instifieth:</hi> of this it followeth, that men being called and iustified at one time; and all doe, or should know, that there can bee no Iustification but by Faith: that therefore in our Calling, we are made to beleeue vnto Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Againe, such places as yoke preaching and beleeuing together, as <hi>Actes</hi> 11. 20, 21. <hi>They preached the Lord Iesus, and a great number beleeued;</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 1. <hi>They spake so as that a great number beleeued;</hi> with innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable places of the like kinde: These manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme to vs, that where G O D S Spirit effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to the heart, by the call and voyce of the Preacher to the care, there followeth Faith as an immediate worke of such a Calling.</p>
                  <p>Now to your second demand, I answer, not euery Faith is a fruite of effectuall calling, and proper to the Elect: for there is a Faith which is so called vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, as a painted fire is called fire; or a dead man is named a man. Such is the faith which doth accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a common outward Calling, and may be found in hypocrites and wicked men; and in some of them there is historicall faith onely, by a generall illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being made to vnderstand and beleeue the doctrine of Scriptures to be of G O D; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to bee most true and worthy of credit: and thus much the Diuels doe beleeue, and so farre the blinde Scribes and Pharises came: but in others

For this power of receiuing Christ vnto saluation, belongs to faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie amongst all the gifts of God. Where of there is cleere proofe; for it is neuer written of any other gift, that thereby Christ is receiued: but this is attributed often vnto faith, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Beleeuing in the name of Christ, and receiuing him,</hi> are put the one for the other: <hi>As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as receiued him, to them hee gaue prerogatiue to be the Sonnes of God, euen to them which beleeue in his name.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>By whom wee (which before were sinners and enemies,</hi> verse 8. 10.) <hi>haue now</hi> (that is, <hi>since we had faith to beleeue to instification,</hi> verse 1.) <hi>receiued the atonement.</hi> And hereunto that in <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 14.

Whereof it is, that this finely faith is termed the faith of Christ: not onely because Christ is the giuer of it, or the proper and especiall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect; but especially because it carrieth vs to Christ. As the sicke of the palsie, who himselfe could not goe, was by others carried to Christ, <hi>to be healed of him;</hi> Mat. 8. 1. 2: So wee being maymed and lame, yea, dead; yet when wee thorow grace are quickened to beleeue the promise, wee are carried to Christ, as it were on the shoulders of our faith; which is also the foote whereby we walk to him, the eye whereby we see him, the mouth whereby wee eate him, the hand of our soule whereby wee receiue him, and apply him to our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Now if ye please branch out this faith into his parts, and acquaint vs with the seuerall measures of it, that so the doctrine of faith may yet bee fuller and cleerer to our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings! for I thinke ye are of this minde, that all haue not a like faith, neither doe ye take faith (as some thinke) to bee onely a generall knowledge and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

desire, if first I doe deliuer somewhat vnto you of the<note place="margin">Qualities of faith.</note> two adioynts or qualities proper to this faith; to wit, particularity and certainty: it being a particular and<note place="margin">1. Certainty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Particularity.</note> certaine receiuing of Christ Iesus. First for certainty, it is of the nature of faith, to breede certainty or assurance of the thing beleeued: we are not more certaine that we see what we see, or do hold what we haue in our hands, then we are certaine of hauing and enioying that which by faith we see and receiue. In as much as doubting is ioyned with faith, (the faithfull hauing many doubts) this commeth of the weakenesse and infirmity of faith; as the shaking and daddering of the hand proceeds of some naturall imbecility and feeblenesse, and yet the hand holds surely that it hath caught: so it commeth of the frailety of faith, that we stagger and doubt; (<hi>O ye of little faith, why doe ye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>?</hi> Mat. 6.) yet faith for the nature of it doth surely receiue and hold the promise. Hence it is, that faith is defined for the certainty and cleerenesse of it to bee <hi>the ground or subsistence of things hoped for, the euidence or demonstration of things which are not seene;</hi> Heb. 11. 1. The meaning whereof<note place="margin">So the Greeke Scholiast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it, as Master Beza cites him.</note> is thus much, as if the holy Ghost should say; Faith is the very substance or essence of things hoped for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the things which bee but hoped for, are yet to<note place="margin">Heb. 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And also it is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration or euidence of things not seene, because to the eye of faith, as things absent are present, so things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, become as if they were visible; the vnderstanding enlightened by faith, seeing those things, which yet

                     </gap>. Now how should this be truly spoken of faith, were it not a certaine and firme comprehension of things. Which further appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in this, that assurance is attributed to faith, where it is written; <hi>Draw neere in assurance of faith.</hi> Heb 10. 22. And of <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4. 20. It is saide, <hi>He was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by faith of the promise made him.</hi> Where it is to be obserued, that doubting is an effect of vnbeliefe, is set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst assurance the effect of faith. Hee doubted not through vnbeliefe, but being strong in faith, he was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured fully <hi>that the promiser was able to doe it;</hi> Rom. 4. 20. 21. For as vpon the holding or receiuing a thing into the hand, groweth an assurance of hauing that thing; and therefore we say, it is in his hands, hee is sure of it, or he is not sure of it; for it is not yet in his hands: so v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our receiuing and holding Christ by the hand of faith, followes an assurance that he is ours, and that by him God is become our mercifull Father, and hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen vs our sinnes and will saue vs euerlastingly from whence commeth a boldnesse and confidence, that as Children to their Parents, so we can confidently come to God through Christ beleeued on: <hi>By whom we haue boldnesse, and entrance with confidence, by faith in him;</hi> Ephe. 3. 12. Where note these things, how they hang together. 1. Faith. 2. Thereupon assurance. 3. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon confidence and also boldnesse. The faithfull hauing such a high Priest &amp; Mediator, as is higher then the heauens, which can doe all in all with his Father; they are more then assured of reconcilement &amp; fauour: <hi>for they boldly come to the throne of Grace, with trust and<note place="margin">Heb. 4. verse last.</note> confidence to find helpe in the time of neede.</hi> Further, if we cannot be certaine by the certainty of faith, of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3215:38"/>
concerning saluation, then how could we be saide<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>by faith to haue peace with God?</hi> What peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse can there be, when there lacketh certainty? and how could it be truly written, that by faith we stand in grace? for standing notes stedfast firmenesse. Finally, the word of promise being more firme then heauen and earth; and the mercies, truth, and power of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser being infinite and vnchangeable: what should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but that the beleeuer may assure himselfe to haue the thing promised? And how then are they too blame which teach the doctrine of doubting, vnlesse we haue speciall reuelation from Heauen? That which they say that in respect of our selues being variable, wee may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and worthily doubt, and also through the great-nesse of our sinnes, it is nothing: for our faith resteth not vpon our owne strength, but vpon Gods truth, might, and mercies, which doe farre exceed our sinnes. The greatnesse whereof in the true beleeuer, doth make his truth and mercies so much the more renowned and illustrious, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4, 5. <hi>Therefore let the faithfull striue against motions of doubting, yeeld not, but grew more and more assured: and the more strong ye are in faith, the lesse ye shall doubt;</hi> which euer commeth of the weakenesse of faith, as I haue saide.</p>
                  <p>Touching the other thing, that faith is not onely a<note place="margin">2.

The last and fift thing, is a power to instruct others, as namely those vnder their charge (as children &amp; seruants) that which they know themselues: This was in beleeuing <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18. It must be in <hi>Abrahams</hi> children. This which I haue spoken of knowledge, shutteth out the implicit blinde faith of the Papists; amongst whom, one may hold the place of a faithfull man, and yet know nothing more then to rehearse the Creede, &amp; the Lords Prayer, and ten Commandements; or to beleeue as the Church beleeueth, though they know not what that is. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">2. Assent.</note> thing required in faith, it is assent; that the minde agree to the thing knowne, to hold it for a truth, and be so certainely perswaded thereof, as hee will iudge the contrary false whensoeuer hee meeteth with it; and be ready to endure anything, rather then to denie such truth. Such an assent was in <hi>Thomas,</hi> when he saw and felt Christs hands and side; and in <hi>Peter,</hi> being perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">2 Pet 1. 16.</note> the thing which he taught concerning Christ, to be no fables; also in <hi>Paul,</hi> who was so resolued of the truth of the doctrine which he knew, as he was willing to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer euen death, rather then to renounce it. All the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires of Christ in yeelding their liues for Christ, did wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the world, that they had firmely assented vnto, and were throughly resolued of the vndoubted truth, which they knew and professed.</p>

But letting other things passe, here I will onely proue it to be the duty of faith, to appropriate the doctrine of Christ touching eternall saluation by him; to a mans selfe particularly, and to shew that faith makes a man beleeue his owne saluation; and not onely that there is saluation purchased for sinnes by Christ, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth.

or by humane power? And who can doubt, which will not hoodwinke his eyes not to see that which is so manifest, that many in the Church come so farre as to see, and to assent vnto the whole doctrine of Christ, euen to the professing &amp; declaring it to others distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; learnedly? of whom yet there may be great doubt made, that all such are not true beleeuers endued with this liuely faith, effectuall to saluation. Wherefore the Commandement pressing vs to beleeue the Gospell, hath meaning to presse vs to beleeue it with particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that the doctrine of saluation by Christ belongs to our selues, as the Elect may passe further then a naturall man can doe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it may appeare to be so, because belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and eating are put one for the other; <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 47. compared with verse 50, 51. Now euery one knoweth this action of eating to be an appropriating to a mans owne selfe, a portion of meat which is prouided for all; so is beleeuing an application to a mans selfe of such promises as are commonly propounded to the whole Assembly. Tell me, will itsuffice a man for the nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing and preseruing of his bodily strength, when hee commeth to a Table well furnished with meate, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade himselfe that the meate is very wholsome, good for nourishment, and well dressed; or may hee not goe away hungry and feeble, if hee doe not take the meate, and by eating make it his owne? So when a sinner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to a Sermon, where hee heareth the doctrine of the Gospell so mildly and distinctly taught and proued, will it suffice him to saluation to credit it certainly to be a diuine truth, onely able to saue poore sinners, and to haue beene truly and wisely handled? May he not for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3215:40"/>
all this, goe home in as bad case as he came, as far from saluation, except by beleefe he receiue that meate of heauenly truth into his owne heart particularly to be refreshed by a sure perswasion of the same, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaines to himselfe.</p>

Also, when Sat an tempteth any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout particularity of saluation, to doubt that himselfe cannot be saued, Christ died not for him; will it not be too weake a buckler to beate backe this assault, to say, I doe surely beleeue the whole truth of doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning redemption by Iesus Christ, that hee alone came from God, and is the onely Sonne of God, and that there is saluation by no other? Nay, will not the tempter replie, I my selfe beleeue so much, and yet tremble? And <hi>Iulian</hi> beleeued, and protested so much, and yet an Apostata.

He doth not teach that it is of like quantity and measure, but of like quality and worth: for the faith of euery one of the Elect hath the same Authour, euen the holy Ghost; the same meanes, the Gospell, and Word of truth; the same obiect whereunto it looketh., Christ and his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: Also one and the same marke whereunto it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, the glory of God, and saluation of the soule. In all these things there is likenesse and agreement betweene the weake and strong faith; yea, and sundry other things there be wherein this likenesse holds: for euery faith, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the strongest is still vnperfect; we beleeue in part, as we doe but know in part: the best beleeuer hath need to say; <hi>Lord encrease my faith.</hi> It doth therefore belong to euery degree of faith, as a thing common, to take the vse of all meanes, both priuate and publike, for support and helpe of it; lest any tempt God by refusing the meanes, whereof all haue need continually. Beside this, each faith little and great, may bee knowne of him in whom it is (vnlesse it be in a great storme of temptation, or at the instant and about the time of their first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion:) else Christ would not haue asked particular men if they did beleeue; nor <hi>Paul</hi> would haue saide of himselfe: <hi>I know whom I haue beleeued;</hi> nor exhorted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to examine themselues <hi>if they be in the faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 6. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. Yet moreouer, in each faith this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that the things beleeued, are aboue compasse of naturall reason: for if we consider the things which the Word setteth forth to be beleeued, as for example, that the World was made of nothing; that a dead body tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3215:43"/>
into dust, shall liue againe; that a Virgin remaining a Virgin, can be a Mother; that God and man is one person; that so many thousand beleeuers so far distant, are one body; that Saints in Earth are one with Christ in Heauen, and eate &amp; drinke him without diminishing; that one offence of one man condemned the whole world; that the righteousnesse of one man maketh mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions to be iust; that God is then a Father, when hee shewes himselfe an enemy: in these and many such like things, faith can beleeue them, (because God hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them) when blinde reason cannot see. Lastly, one faith is as sufficient to saue as another, a little as wel as a great; because a weake faith can looke vpon Christ, and lay hold on him no lesse truly, then a strong and great faith; euen as a weake and sore eye, might behold the brasen Serpent to health, as well as a sound and cleere eye: but though there be such great and manifold like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse betweene faith and faith; yet this letteth not, but that there is a difference amongst the godly, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the diuers measures of their faith: euen as much as betweene the hand of a babe and of a man; betweene a young plant and a growne tree. The most wise God distributing his graces as it pleaseth him, to some thus, to some otherwise: so as none haue cause to disdaine such as be infirme, if themselues be strong; for it was God who established them: nor any to enuie others, if haply they doe not so abound in wisedome and faith, as others doe; because it was God that so disposed eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man his portion. But the strong must apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to helpe the weaker, bearing with infirmities; and the weaker with reuerence and loue to honor such as goe before them. Euen as the foote doth not lift vp
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3215:44"/>
it selfe against the head, nor the head doth not despise the foote; but each member respecteth and cherisheth one another, to the preseruation of the whole body: so let beleeuing Christians in respect of God (who doth all in them of his good pleasure) worke out their saluation in feare and trembling, euery one being thankefull to him for their owne measure; knowing that they haue nothing but what is giuen: thinking themselues happy to haue at all any measure of liuely faith; and in respect of themselues, to walke in mutuall loue, one supporting and comforting another in all loue and modesty, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth Saints.</p>

                  <p>Whereas yee haue shewed many things wherein the two measures of faith doe accord and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; let it not be offensiue to you, that I put you in mind of one correspondency between them, which it should seeme you thought not vpon, and that is this; It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to each degree of faith, first, to beleeue the promise before they come to any experience, feeling, or comfort from the apprehension of Gods mercies: as in the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who verily beleeued that Iesus was the <hi>Messias,</hi> and would minister helpe to her distressed daughter, which was vexed with a Diuell, as the Story shewes; <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 23. when as yet shee had not onely no experience, but rather all things went crosse and contrary to her. Therefore it was a fault in <hi>Thomas,</hi> who would haue his senses the guide of his faith: <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I feele and see</hi> (saith he) <hi>I will in no wise beleeue; Ioh.</hi> 20. 25. whereas our Sauiour pronounced them blessed who beleeue, and see not. For it is not in supernaturall and diuine, as it is in humane and natural things, where by our sense and experience we are led: but in heauenly
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3215:44"/>
matters, first of all Gods children giue credit to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, striuing against in-bred distrust; they doe beleeue God to be true, who hath spoken the word: so as they waite vpon God, till in his time he giue the feeling and comfort of that which they trust to be truly promised: a marke worthy to be thought on, because many esteem of faith by feeling, iudging themselues to haue no faith, because they want comfortable and ioyous feeling; which is not faith, but a fruit and consequent of faith, in some more, in some lesse, and sometime none at all, as in time of some great triall.</p>

                  <p>No <hi>Aquila,</hi> I am not offended, that yee did admonish me hereof; I rather thanke you, and wish you still to admonish me: not withstanding, this matter I knew would come further to be spoken of, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of this doctrine touching the seuerall degrees of faith. But to goe forwards, I thinke good to deliuer vnto you seuerally the difference betweene these two measures of faith more distinctly &amp; fully, as their like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and agreement hath beene opened. And first for the least measure and degree of faith, it is this; when Christians cannot certainly &amp; distinctly say, I beleeue my own saluation, and the pardon of all my sinnes: but being displeased with themselues for their sinnes, they doe vnfainedly &amp; constantly desire the pardon of them all, and their reconciliation with God aboue the whole World; yea, aboue a world of worlds. And this their desire of faith, it is a degree of faith, the seed and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of faith, stirred vp by the <hi>Spirit of adoption; Rom.</hi> 8. 26. pleasing God as faith it selfe, hauing great promises made to it; <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 37. As that indicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Master <hi>Perkins</hi> hath sufficiently proued, both in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3215:45"/>
his reformed Catholike, and in the Book intituled, the <hi>Graine of Mustard seede.</hi> Therefore to let passe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of that point, it is to be now shewed, who be the persons in whom this weake faith is to be found: which I find to be of two sorts. The first is of such who haue but little knowledge, by reason whereof their faith must needs be infirme: Examples hereof we haue in Scripture, in <hi>Rahab,</hi> the <hi>Samaritanes; Ioh.</hi> 4. 42. the Apostles of Christ at their first calling, and <hi>Cornelius:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cornelius.</note> whereof some of them did onely know the promise touching a Messias, and did not so much as know Iesus to be the Christ. Others which knew this, yet were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant<note place="margin">Apostles.</note> by what meanes he should effect the Worlds redemption, hauing their heads troubled with conceit of an earthly Monarchy; full little then thinking that the life of the Lord and Master, should be the worlds ransome, and that his resurrection should be the worlds conquest and victory; they dreaming of an outward glorious reigne ouer the World, and hoping to be great men in great place vnder him: howbeit they gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing credit to his doctrine, and embracing him for the Messias, depending vpon his mouth in matter of duty and saluation, they had a measure of faith, though a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and weake one; as Christ himselfe doth testifie of them all, <hi>O ye of little faith:</hi> and of <hi>Peter</hi> by name; <hi>O thou</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? Mat.</hi> 14. 31. and as they signifie of themselues by their owne petition; <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 5. <hi>Lord encrease our fasth.</hi> The other sort of weake ones in faith, be such as hauing more knowlege in the mystery of Christ touching the worke of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by his sufferings and righteousnesse; yet doe very weakely apply this their knowledge, not being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3215:45"/>
of the forgiuenesse of their owne sinnes, and of their reconciliation with God; but earnestly desiring to embrace and beleeue the promise of it: and of this sort of beleeuers there haue been in all ages very many in the Church of God, euer since the ascension of Christ, as daily experience proueth in many honest Christians, which can speake well and distinctly of the doctrine of grace, and yet haue laide but poore hold of it for their own safety and comfort, much doubting themselues.</p>

                  <p>But Sir, by this meanes it wil come to passe, that many which are farre enough from true faith, will be ready to imagine themselues to haue some measure of faith: for euery one will by and by alledge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that he hath a good desire to beleeue in Christ, and so be lulled asleepe to their own perdition, presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of that which they in truth doe want.</p>

                  <p>Indeed <hi>Aquila</hi> you say well, this is a thing may be feared; howbeit there be diuers good and sure workes to discerne a sound desire to beleeue in Christ, which is the lowest degree of a liuely faith, from all vaine desires of wicked men &amp; hypocrites, which may pretend to haue it, and yet haue it not. The first is, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in them whose desire is sound and godly, there is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueting<note place="margin">Markes of a sound desire.</note> rather of reconciliation then of saluation; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee in grace and fauour with God, then to bee happy in heauen: for their desire commeth from a bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed heart, greeued and cast downe for the offence of God, and his displeasure conceiued against their sinne; so as to haue but one good looke of God, one smile of his louing countenance, it is more desired of them then the World; nay, then the glory of Heauen: as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3215:46"/>
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> prayeth; <hi>O lift thou vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs: Psal.</hi> 4. 7. And elsewhere the Church prayeth, <hi>Returne, and let the light of thy countenance shine vpon vs, and we shall be whole; Psal.</hi> 80. 3. And in another place, the godly professe saying, <hi>In thy fauour is life.</hi> It is true, that one cannot haue the fauour of God, but he is sure to be saued; and it is lawfull to desire saluation: but yet the thing which the beleeuing broken heart doth cheefly looke vnto, it is to be loued and fauoured of God. Againe, this godly desire is vehement, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> slight or light, but very feruent; like to the desire after meate of one pinched with hunger, which is very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest (as we say, hunger wil breake the hard stone wals:) or to the desire and longing of a woman with childe, which vseth to be very vehement: such is this sound de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of them who begin to beleeue, they couet more to be satisfied with a full sight of Gods face, then world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings desire siluer and gold; the doctrine of grace being to them more desirable, euen then the <hi>finest gold; Psal.</hi> 19. Wee haue heard of the desire of the Cananitish woman for her Daughter being vexed with a Diuell; and we reade of the chased Hart, breathing &amp; panting after the coole water brookes; euen so the soule chased by temptations, scorched with the heate of sinful lusts, hauing begun once to taste the sweetnesse, or but to feele the neede of sauing mercies, doth most eagerly and sharpely desire to attaine vnto them. This earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of desire, it is not in them by fits and starts, like <hi>Pilates</hi> desire to know the truth; <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. which as a weake sparkle quickly died of it selfe; but it is constant, as is the desire of a thirsty man, whose desire ceaseth not till his thirst be quenched; such as <hi>Anna</hi> her desire
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3215:46"/>
was after a childe, it was great and continued, till the thing was granted which she did desire: so it fareth with a sound desire to beleeue and find Christ, it lasteth till faith bee formed in the heart, and Christ be borne in them, they are not quiet till then, nor then neither; still more and more desiring to bee knit and ioyned neerer to Christ, their loue, their ioy, their crowne, their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Lastly, this witnesseth the soundnesse of this godly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> desire, to beleeue in Iesus Christ, that it bringeth forth some good affections, which are accompanied with some reformation of life and manners. They in whom it is, being carefull according to that they know, to obey and please God, hauing with their desire to beleeue ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an vnfained desire to repent, and to liue honestly, keeping a good conscience towards God and men in all things. There is the quite contrary of all these, to bee seene in vnfaithfull men; for their desire it is of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and not at all of Gods loue, as <hi>Balaam</hi> would be blessed, but tooke no thought to be reconciled to God, or to reforme his way. Againe, their desires be faint, and be soone quelled, being neither vehement nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant; and no maruell, for they are vnsound, rather see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themselues, that it may be well with them, then that God may set his heart vpon them, and loue them, and be glorified in his mercies towards them: And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, they desire to be forgiuen &amp; saued; but it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out desire to repent, and amend their liues: they like Heauen well, but not the way that leadeth thither; their desire being to bee glorified with God, by hauing his blessing and ioy, and not to glorifie him by doing his will.</p>

As by the exhortation of <hi>Peter</hi> may be gathered; <hi>Grow in grace, and in knowledge of our Lord:</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. verse last; for the faithful doe that which by him they are exhorred to doe: and by likening faith to a graine of mustard-seede, whose quality is to grow till it be a large tree; but though this be the nature of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing grace, to waxe and encrease, yet exhortations to quicken mens care, they may doe very well.

                  <p>Friend <hi>Aquila,</hi> you will (I see) prouide mee<note place="margin">That there is a strong faith.</note> worke enough; your questions be like a chaine with many linkes, which must be loosed not all together (for that were a breaking and not a loosing) but apart, one after another. That there is such a measure of faith, which deserues to be termed strong, it is very plaine by these few Texts following; <hi>Abraham being strong in faith:</hi> Rom. 4. 20. And <hi>O woman, great is thy faith;</hi> Mat. 15. 28. and of the Centurions faith, <hi>I haue not</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>found so great faith, no not in Israel; Luke</hi> 7. 9.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3215:48"/>
That the Centurion which was a Gentile by nature, a Souldier by profession, and saw in Christs person for outward appearance, nothing saue weakenesse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, should yet haue such firme perswasion of his power and goodnesse (hauing no particular promise) as to beleeue, and to be resolued in his minde, that Iesus was able to helpe his sicke seruant, and that without his bodily presence, or touching, onely by speaking the word, hee should chase away such an inueterate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady: this was a strong faith indeede. The like ye may see in <hi>Abraham,</hi> that hee being an hundred yeeres old, and his wife barren &amp; stricken with age, neuer hearing of any before to be made Parents at these yeeres, yet without any former example to beleeue vpon the word and promise of God, that he should be a father, and that of such a childe of whom should come Nations, and in whom all nations shuld be blessed; and when he was to be sacrificed, yet then to be perswaded surely that God would keepe that promise; this was a great faith and a strong. But this is none of the linkes of your chaine,<note place="margin">That there be diuers mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of a strong faith, and what they be.</note> the first whereof is when faith may be counted strong and great; when by the worke of the Spirit ones heart is carried beyond that desire of pardon, which before was spoken of, euen vnto a sure and setled perswasion, that through Gods mercies in Christ, his owne sinnes are pardoned to him, and hee fully reconciled to God, vnto the cleere certainty of his owne saluation. The weake faith already described, is truly perswaded, that sinnes may be forgiuen, and desires to haue them forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with some certainty to obtaine; but this strong faith besides desire and certainty, hath setlednesse and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of perswasion, that all is already remitted and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3215:48"/>
As it is reported of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, that he was fully assured thereby, that God which had shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe willing to promise, was also able to doe it; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 19. Such a perswasion was in <hi>Iob,</hi> when he could say; <hi>I will trust in God, though he kill me: Iob.</hi> 13. 15. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>I know my Redeemer liueth; Iob</hi> 19. 25. And in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> when hee so confidently professed, that hee <hi>could lacke nothing, because God was his Shepheard; Psal.</hi> 23. 1. and that <hi>God was his shield, and fortresse, his buckler, and his strong Sauiour; Psal.</hi> 18. 1, 2. Lastly, in <hi>Paul</hi> and others, <hi>we know,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35. <hi>I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded neither height nor depth shall separate vs.</hi> Yet take this withall, that when I speake of this strong faith, that it is a full perswasion, I meane it not absolutely, as if there were any such strength of faith as hath no weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, no wants, or defects at all; vnlesse haply in some particular thing: as in that which was said to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he <hi>should be Father of many Nations;</hi> wherein it is saide, hee was not weake in faith, or doubted through vnbeleefe; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 19. For all faith (as before was saide) is vnperfect: but strong faith is called a full perswasion in comparison of a weaker faith, which hath not such a measure of certainty and perswasion.</p>
                  <p>Now to the second linke, whether this measure of strong faith doth not admit sundry measures and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences? It is true, there is so. <hi>Moses</hi> might beleeue more strongly then <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> more strongly then <hi>Moses;</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> more strongly then <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> yet more fully then <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> more strongly then they all. Amongst men of strong constitution, some may excell others in courage and strength: so amongst them which be strong in faith, one may exceed another
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3215:49"/>
in power of beleeuing; but of this strong faith there be<note place="margin">Two mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of strong faith.</note> two euident degrees. The first is of such as throughfull assurance of faith, doe feele in their hearts vnspeakable ioy and glorious; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. euen in tribulations; <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3. Others which be fully perswaded in their soules of Gods mercies towards them in Christ, and yet are without feeling any comfort thereof for the time. And sure this is a greater degree of the twain; it is not a thing of such strength, nor a matter so great, in ioyfull feelings to beleeue Gods loue, one hauing as it were a pawne of it in their hand: as when one hath God frowning vpon him, and lieth in some greeuous distresse outward or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or both; then to beleeue fully and strongly that God is still a Father, and will saue and deliuer him, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a mighty faith.

Or for <hi>Dauid,</hi> when his soule was cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downe, and vnquiet within him, and all the waues of God came ouer him; yet then to say, <hi>Hee is my present helpe, and my God;</hi> Psal. 42. 5, 11. <hi>I will yet giue him thanks;</hi>

And this it is which you did aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise me of, as thinking I had forgotten it; that there may be a true faith, yea, and a great measure of it too for a time, where there is no comfortable experience and feeling. For as the Sunne may for a time cast forth his beames to the giuing of light, when there is no heat nor warmth: so the Sunne of righteousnesse Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, may kindle a light of some knowledge in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of mercy, before there come to the soule the heat and warmth of ioy and comfort. And where both light and heate haue beene giuen, hee may seuer them at his pleasure; which he is pleased sometimes to do, denying to his members a ioyfull sence of mercies for some space, for very good causes and respects.</p>
                  <p>First vpon some sinne committed, he with-draweth his louing countenance, taking from them inward ioy of heart, that by the absence of it, they may be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for their sinne; as a father for the better humbling of his childe after some fault, will denie him wonted fauour, and looke vpon it with a displeasant eye: and by this meanes also Gods children are brought the better to consider the greatnesse of their offence, not onely for humbling, but for whetting their prayers to moue them to more earnestnesse in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Also herein God taketh great triall of their faith and loue, and hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion on the other side to expresse and giue his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren experience of his mighty grace, in sustaining and releeuing them; his power is knowne in weakenesse.

and lastly, it serueth for the awing of others, to keepe<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. verse 10.</note> them in feare of offending, lest they also loose the ioy of their heart in Gods countenance; as a Father will shew anger to one childe, to informe and terrifie the rest: vnto which wee may adde another consideration, that ioy is often clouded or ecclipsed, that when it breakes out againe, and the minde is cheered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed afresh, then the comforts of the Spirit may be more esteemed, more thankfully receiued, and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retained. Things lightly come by, are lightly set by; but euery thing is more accounted of, the more hardly we get it: therfore as we see a faire day more welcome after a soule, or a calme or rest more embraced after a storme or trouble; so is ioy of spirit more valued when it commeth after deepe heauinesse and much anguish of spirit: for these respects Gods children must haue patience, and striue to endure the lack of comfort, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering it will returne with such aduantage; yea, and bee thankfull for such a schooling that it hath pleased God to send them such a bitter remembrance for so good ends: for though it be the most greeuous thing in the World to haue our spirit wounded, which should sustaine and beare vs out in all infirmities and afflictions, (Sand and Iron not being so heauy as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of heart) yet surely in all Gods Children it hath a comfortable issue: for which as God is to be waited on till it come, so also he is to be praised for ministring such strength of faith as to be able to beleeue in him, when nothing is seene and felt but terror and griefe, and matter of despaire. And where as yee asked how, and by what steppes Gods people doe climbe vp vnto this height of beleefe, in this I will satisfie you; that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3215:50"/>
there are sundry duties and meanes, which thorough Gods blessing bring faith in time to such a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. As first of all, the duty of feruent prayer, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> being an exercise of faith, as the body is encreased by exercise being moderate, so is faith encreased by this exercise of prayer; which springing of faith as a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, like a good childe helpeth the mother. Againe, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent prayer is like to a key or a bucket, which doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke and draw out the treasures of Gods mercies. Hence it is, that such as haue beene most frequent in prayer, haue proued fullest of knowledge, faith, loue, and other graces. Let <hi>Dauids</hi> example teach this; none oftener in prayer, none more rich in faith. <hi>Paul</hi> full of faith, because plentifull in prayer. The second duty to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> adde vnto the strength of faith, it is the often religious receiuing of the Lords Supper, which for so much as by the vertue of Gods ordinance it signifieth and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to euery beleeuer in particular the good will of God in Christ for forgiuenesse of sinnes, and withall containeth a sacramentall promise of Christ, and all his benefits, to be distributed to due Communicants, euen to euery faithfull receiuer; <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26, 27, 28. Hence it is, that it serueth greatly to the encrease of faith, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when therewithall is ioyned the diligent and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient hearing of the Gospell preached; which as it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the seede to beget faith, so it is as foode and solid meate to confirme it by the ordinance of God. And this effect it hath the rather, if it be coupled with meditations of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the Euangelicall promise, the very nourishment of true faith; which made godly <hi>Dauid</hi> to be much in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as <hi>Psalm</hi> 119. doth witnesse: so earnestly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to other; <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 2. Besides all this, the long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:3215:51"/>
of Gods mercies and bounty in outward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and in inward graces; <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. throughout, and the carefull obseruations both of them, and of Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> mighty prouidence &amp; protection against dangers, with his assistance against euils and enemies of all sorts, doth not a little auaile to put more life and heart into faith, as appeareth by the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 36. where he grew to that strong confidence of ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Goliah,</hi> by the former triall of Gods might in hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him against the <hi>Lyon</hi> and the <hi>Beare.</hi> Also <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued strongly for time to come, that God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer him, because he had deliuered him; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17, 18. So as the faithfull should doe well to keepe a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Gods mercies and deliuerances, and often goe ouer them in their remembrance and thoughts, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists supersticiously numbred their prayers ouer their beads; so to refresh their faith by recording and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring Gods seuerall sauours, learning more strongly to trust in him, whom they so well know by experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall knowledge; <hi>Let them which know the Lord, put their trust in him: Psal.</hi> 9. 10. Finally, amongst other things,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> which further to bring to this highest pitch of faith, it is of no small moment, to haue a care and watchfull ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in all things to keepe a good conscience: for it is<note place="margin">I am. 2. 22.</note> not written in vaine, that <hi>Abrahams faith was perfected by his workes.</hi> There is a great neerenesse of kindred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene faith and obedience: as faith in the promise of mercy breeds obedience to the Commandements, so obedient walking before God, giues more courage to a faithfull man, the more boldly and surely to expect the performance of the promise, being made to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as out of loue to God obey his will. Therefore in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3215:51"/>
                     <hi>Psalme</hi> 119. the Prophet often encourageth himselfe to beleeue certainly and firmely that God will be good to him to saue him, because he had this testimony within himselfe, that he endeuoured the keeping of his statutes; <hi>Saue me O Lord, for I haue kept thy Testimonies:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; <hi>I haue great delight in thy Statutes, therefore quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me according to thy word:</hi> and many suchlike. Thus friend <hi>Aquila,</hi> in so short roome as I could, I haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered your foure demands; and for an ouerplus, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I laide out certaine markes to trie out the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of desire to beleeue remission of sinnes (which is the least measure of faith:) so I will here deliuer some tokens of the strongest faith, wherby it may be known. The first whereof is this, when a faithfull man is able <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to beleeue the promises, though the meanes seeme euen to fight against the truth of them; as <hi>Dauid</hi> being a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man, yea, and persecuted, yet beleeued the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of his aduancement to the Kingdome. And <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> resteth in the word of Gods promise for <hi>Isaac,</hi> and the blessing of all nations in him, euen when Gods own word of commandement to kill his sonne did warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the word of promise, to blesse all people in that sonne. Secondly, in many and manifold dangers yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> still to cleaue to God, with trust in his mercies, as the Saints spoken of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. They were imprisoned, scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, racked, slaine with the sword, driuen into dennes and caues, and yet they still by faith beleeued God. Thirdly, when any are able to reioyce in their suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and to endure their tribulations with gladnesse, as they that suffered the spoyling of their goods with ioy; <hi>Hob.</hi> 10. 34. and the Apostles, that went away reioycing<note place="margin">Acts 5. 41.</note> that they were counted worthy to suffer for his name.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3215:52"/>
Lastly, if any be ready (if the will of God be) to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> their liues for Christ, as <hi>Antipas,</hi> as the Martyres who loued not their liues vnto death: these things, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5, 6"/> also the contempt of the world, the deniall of our selues, the manifold fruits of charity, when any doe as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> it were forget themselues to seeke the good of others, distributing liberally vnto the necessity of the Saints; these I say are great testimonies of a great measure of Faith: and nothing such a sure token thereof, as to be much and earnest in all kinde of supplications, for our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> selues, for others, and for the whole Church, watching vnto prayer, and being feruent therein. But now good friend <hi>Aquila,</hi> it is meet we should thinke of repairing to our owne houses, to see if all there be in peace and safety.</p>

                  <p>Heerein you say most truly. For true Faith is neuer idle nor barren, but working and fruitefull in good workes. Thence it is called, <hi>Effectuall Faith,</hi> 1. Thess. 1, 3, and elsewhere it is sayde, that <hi>Faith workes by loue,</hi> Gal. 5, 6. of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith it is said, <hi>It wrought with his works,</hi> Iames 2, 22. where the Apostle maketh voydnesse of workes, or want of charity, a note of a dead faith. For, as dead men can woorke no more any humane or naturall worke, so that faith that works<note place="margin">Of the rarenes of faith, how few doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and by what signes it may be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to be so 1. Ignorance.</note> not by charity, is dead. Nothing therefore is such a testimony of the lacke of liuely faith, as mens euil and wicked liues. Many other things there bee, which doe descry this truth, that Faith is a rare gift, &amp; to be found but in a few; as namely, the great ignorance of God,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3215:53"/>
and his will. For there being (as we haue seene before) required in faith a competent knowledge; nay faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the nature of it a diuine wisedom, put into the heart os the elect; therefore the grosse ignoraunce of these times doth argue the rarenes of faith in this age. The which is further testified by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of Gods publike worship, &amp; the prophanation of his Sabbath,<note place="margin">2. Prophanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</note> which doth alwayes (as an handmaid) accompany and waite vpon ignorance: God being serued by some for meere fashion and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This plainly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, how rife infidelity is: whereof this is yet a further demonstration, euen mens fayling in Gods priuate<note place="margin">3. Neglect of priuate prayer</note> worship, either not praying at all with their family, but lying downe like Asses, and rising like Hogges; or else performing it negligently, with coldnesse and want of deuotion. But amongst sundry tokens of the rarenesse of true beleeuers in the Church of God, these two are the most notorious. The former is the vnfaithfull dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling<note place="margin">4 Want of faithfulnesse.</note> of one man toward another, men being so full of craft and subtilty, so cunning and exercised to beguil,<note place="margin">Where shall one finde a faithfull man?</note> as one can hardly tell where to trust; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

These being the dayes wherein affiance cannot be put in a friend, nor confidence in a counsellor, as the Prophet fore-tolde, Mic. 7, 5. This want of ciuill faith, doth bewray the want of Christian faith. For, did men truly beleeue in God, they would surely be carefull to deale so, as that they might deserue to be beleeued of men. Our kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of our promise with men, it being a speciall fruite
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3215:53"/>
of our faith in Gods promises, Ps. 5, 4. Gal. 5, 22. &amp; yet where is he in a maner to be found, that maketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of a promise? Yea, bonds &amp; oathes will scarse<note place="margin">5. Hatred of good men.</note> hold men, they are so slippery and vntrusty. The other thing, is the generall hatred of true beleeuers, of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Christians; who of al others are most scorned and reuiled by all sorts of people. Amongst whom, there is a certaine strife and emulation, who should excell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in malice towards them. If men did beleeue in God, and loue him which begetteth, they would loue such as are begotten of him, 1 Iohn 5, 1. If this bee the marke of a man translated from death of vnbeleefe and sinne, to the life of grace and faith, that they <hi>Loue the Brethren,</hi> 1 Iohn 3, 14. as it is there written, <hi>Hereby we know we are translated from death to life, because wee loue the brethren;</hi> then surely, this ouer-common hatted &amp; despising of the godly, together with the great vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulnes and cruelty which reigneth euery where, doth sufficiently proue the truth of that which is before spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Word, that Christ when he comes, should scarse finde any faith vpon the earth, Luke 18. and this is it which hath bene the condition of all times.

And lastly, the loose liues of such as be Preachers of the faith, auaileth much to hold men in their vnfaithfulnesse and sinne: for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which is to be made of this consideration, it is this, so much the more to encrease a care in men to labour for the gift of faith, by how much it is more rare. Were it so common as Nature is, or as the Word and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is, there were the lesse need of any thought or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uane this way; but being a thing so precious &amp; renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, much talked of in the World, and little felt and enioyed; and there being no Christ nor happinesse without it: it standeth vpon so much the more to giue all diligence, that they may bee found rather amongst the little handfull of beleeuers, then in the multitude of Infidels, which walke the broade way of vnbeliefe and iniquity. Also this admonisheth vs, as to sweate about the getting of faith, by vse of all the meanes afore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;

so to be exceeding thankefull to God for sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating and choosing vs out of the world of vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. They shall deserue to lose their faith, that will not ioyfully and much praise God for it, and endeuour greatly and continually to set it on worke. And so to returne to the other part of your question, about the working and efficacie of a true faith, it is a point wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy your remembrance, and worthy of a more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy discourser then my selfe am. Ye can but haue my best performance, and that I promised you.</p>
                  <p>I finde by the Word (as I beganne to shew) that a liuely faith is a most powerfull and fruitfull gift, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging forth many, sundry, and excellent workes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; whereof that 11. Chapter to the Hebrues giueth plentifull proofe. And it will not be amisse, to runne through a few of those examples named there. We reade of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that his person by faith pleased God; and <hi>Abels</hi> sacrifice through faith was accepted of him. <hi>Noah</hi> by faith beleeued, and feared the iudgement and threatning of God, and prepared the Arke, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with reuerence of his authority that commanded it. <hi>Abraham</hi> by faith, obeyed God, euen to the forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his natiue countrey, to goe to a strange place which he knew not, and to the offering of his son <hi>Isaac,</hi> the sonne of the promise. <hi>Moses</hi> by faith, contemned worldly honours. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Of a liuely ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall faith, there be some workes without vs, which yet neerely concernes vs; or some inward or wrought within vs, which are so wrought, as they sticke and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide within our selues. For these outward workes we are to note, that a liuely faith, it is that effectual instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby an elect person is vnited and knit vnto Christ, to become a member of Christ: &amp; that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee becomes partaker of Christ his perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, performed by his manhoode vnto remission of sinnes, and iustification before God, as it is written; <hi>We conclude that man is instified by Faith,</hi> Rom. 3: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of his spirit for sanctification, as it is written, <hi>

So as our faith carrying vs vnto Christ, effecteth for vs those three most excellent gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of vnion with him, instification by him, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, which I call outward, because faith goeth out of our selues to finde them in Christ. Now the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward effect and worke offaith, are all those workes of Christ dwelling in our hearts, euen whatsoeuer Christ dwelling in vs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> within vs, the same are workes of faith. As a peaceable and setled conscience, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of finne pardoned; an accesse vnto the gracious presence of God, a marueilous ioy of heart by this
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3215:56"/>
meanes, a certaine hope of heauenly glory, a sense and feeling of the former benefits, and of the infinite loue of God shed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost, cheerfull patience in all tribulations; all which effects do spring from the application of Christ by faith, as it is apparent by Rom. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, whatsoeuer spirituall graces there bee, with the increase of them all, they bee the effectes of faith; as is cleare by this, that often in Scripture fayth is set before other Graces, as the roote, mother, and spring of them all: see 2 Peter 1, 5. <hi>Ioyne with your faith vertue, &amp;c.</hi> all Graces being as handmaides to attend vpon Faith, as their Mistris and Queene, yea following and resting vpon it as vpon their beginning &amp; ground. For faith beeing the instrument of our vnion with Christ, and of our partaking with his righteousnes and Spirit, it must necessarily follow, that the whole traine of sauing Graces be the fruites of faith; which as it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth holde on his sufferings and obedience for our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying, so it deriueth vertue and force from his death and resurrection, for the killing of the old man, or for the defacing of the image of Satan, which consisteth in all manner of vices; and for the quickening of the new man, and erecting of the image of God, which consists in righteousnesse and holinesse: so as he which hath true faith, can lacke no sauing Graces. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, our faith in Christ, is our victory ouer the world, 1 Iohn 5, 4. treading downe in our hearts that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which reignes in the world; strengthening vs to beare the reproaches, troubles, and persecution of the world, and arming to resist, yea enabling to conquer Satan the prince of the world, 1 Pet. 5, 8, 9. And which
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3215:56"/>
is most of all, such is the power of faith, as it doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vs in some sort to ouercome euen God himselfe. For it was by faith, that <hi>Iacob</hi> had power to preuayle with God, Gen. 32, 28. and that <hi>Moses</hi> did (as it were) binde the hands of God to withhold iudgement from his people, whom he was minded to destroy; had not <hi>Moses</hi> his seruant stoode in the breach before him, to turne away his wrath, lest he should destroy them, Psa. 106, 23. And in Exodus, when <hi>Moses</hi> prayed by faith, <hi>Let me alone,</hi> faith God, Exo. 32. as if faith could mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and binde Gods hands. The due meditation of all these effects and workes of faith, plainly proueth men of euill life, to haue no faith. It conuinceth hypocrites to be vnfaithful, because professing faith, they haue not the power of it in their hearts. Also, it stoppeth the mouths of Papists, who charge the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> to teach and commend an idle faith, which should giue liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and open the windowes to all licentiousnesse. Also it serueth to direct euery one in whom is true faith, to discerne of himselfe that he is endewed with it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he feels the proper effects in himselfe. Lastly, it must stir vp and encrease the diligence of all Gods children, to nourish a gift which is of such force and efficacy, of such mighty power, and manifold profit.</p>

                  <p>Examples whereof are rife in the Book of God, and in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> common life: but the chiefe hurt of incredulity is, that it shutteth out from the blessed and glorious kingdome of God, <hi>For without shall be fearefull, vnbeleeuers; Reuel.</hi> 21. 8. yea, and throweth downe head-long into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> perdition, to suffer vengeance in flaming fires, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they obey not the Gospel of Christ: <hi>For he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues not, the wrath of God is vpon him; Iohn</hi> 3. 36. and <hi>such shall be condemned; Marke</hi> 16. 16.

all faith in God, to cal in question the Scriptures, &amp; God Author of them. <hi>The foole hath said in his heart there is no God; Ps.</hi> 14. 1. And the diuel wil suggest as much vnto the very godliest and wisest heart; but take this for a truth, that therefore there is a God, and the promises of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie are hereby proued to bee diuine, because yee are tempted to think otherwise. Were there no God indeed, or were not Euangelical promises and the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from him, yee should neuer bee troubled with thoughts of these matters. But because they be both most certaine, and the certaine beleeuing of both being to the great commodity of the Christian soule: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Satan so busieth himselfe, to weaken the credit of them; for hee knowes that by such vnbeleefe his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is vnderpropped. And hold this sure, that that is very good and of God, whatsoeuer our corrupt nature and Satan be most against. But as touching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Reasons to proue Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be of God.</note> the word of faith, that it is the Word of God, and from heauen, there be sundry and sound arguments to perswade it.</p>
                  <p>First, the great harmony and constant consent of one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> part of this Booke with another in such a huge variety of infinite matter, yet no repugnancy; howsoeuer some diuersity may be found. Secondly, the maiesty of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> matter in great simplicity of words. Thirdly, the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> power, and vertue thereof, working in the hearts of sinners for their conuersion, which no other writing in the World doth or can effect: for mens natures in<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 24, 25.</note> their reasons and wils being corrupt, are as contrary to the doctrine taught in these books, as darknesse to light,<note place="margin">As Foelix, Acts 24.</note> heauen to hell; yet are they by the mighty efficacy hid in them, reconciled to them, so as they willingly yeeld,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:3215:61"/>
approue, and honour them also the power of them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth euen the wicked to feare and tremble. Fourthly, the euents of all Prophecies, so many hundred, yea, some thousand yeeres foreshewed and made before, yet accordingly fulfilled in their due time, doth bewray them to be from that all-seeing verity.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the Penmen<note n="*" place="margin">As Moses, Iob. Dauid, Mathew, Paul.</note> of the Scriptures discouering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> their owne corruptions and infirmities, euen to their owne preiudice, and cracke of their owne estimation in the World, and so vnpartially reporting the foule ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes of their own people and countreymen, doth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie, that they were gouerned by the holy Spirit in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> penning of them. Sixtly, there be sundry examples and stories in the Bible, to which euen the Heathen and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, yea, and Iewish writers being enemies to Christ, doe giue testimony to the truth of them, as in <hi>Iosephus</hi> and others; and the witnesse of an enemy, it is of no small credit and force. Seauenthly, the strange preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> of these Bookes, notwithstanding the strong malice of the Diuell, and his mischeeuous policies and practises of his most wicked Instruments to suppresse and extinguish them, yet that they should be so kept as to remaine entire without losse of any Booke, nay, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny iot or tittle, (as very iudiciously learned men doe thinke) this diuine protection doth argue that their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> is diuine. Adde vnto all this, the constant te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony which so many worthy Martyrs by their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> death and bloud haue giuen to this truth. Lastly, euery one of Gods children haue the witnesse of God his own Spirit, the Authour of the Scriptures, to testifie in their consciences of them, that they are inspired of God, and doe containe a diuine infallible truth. So then the good

correspondency of all parts of the Bible, the maiesty of matter in plainenesse of wordes; the rare effects vpon mens consciences for conuerting, humbling, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, terrifying, such as no humane writings can worke; the certaine exhibiting and accomplishment of foretold persons and things; the vprightnesse of the Instruments set a worke to pen them; the testimony of the Inditer the holy Spirit, and of the holy martyrs in their blood shed for it; and the miraculous preseruation of the Scriptures in so many ages, notwithstanding so great meanes and oportunities of extinguishing them, euery one of these, seuerally, and all ioyntly together, doe serue to stop Satans mouth, when it shall be opened against the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine originall of Scriptures.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3215:62"/>
to pray for pardon of our sinnes, and euerlasting salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the praise of his mercy; and giuen his Spirit into the hearts of his Children, as a witnesse to themselues of their owne adoption (a witnesse that cannot lie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit of truth,) and withall wrought so many gracious gifts and works in them, which none can haue but such as are in his fauour, beloued in his Sonne; and is not all this in effect as much as if a particular promise were made by name vnto euery one of the faithfull of their owne happinesse? Againe, whosoeuer he be that out of the fit of temptations beleeues the promises to belong to himselfe, that Christ loued him, and died for him, and doth beleeue it truly; the same may assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe euen in the pangs of temptation, that the promises still belong vnto him, because God is of an vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature and will. And doth not euen this proue that God would haue men to beleeue firmely their owne saluation, because Satan would haue vs to doubt of it? Are not God and Satan flat opposites, and contraries? And whereas you say, ye are no where commanded to beleeue your owne saluation; yes, euen this is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as much as ye are commanded to trust in God for your temporal preseruation and prouision of things for this life: ye may as well say, I am not commanded to beleeue that God will cloth me.</p>

the doers be such as are culpable of very great vnthank fulnesse, forgetting so many and great mercies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them and theirs, and haue bound themselues by many promises to God; for all this, vpon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed repentance, comming to God with sorrow for them, and with faith in Gods mercies through Christ, they are graciously receiued. And if it were not thus, none could be saued. For, who sinnes not after repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and after receiuing of many great blessings, and making many deepe promises of a better life? There is not one but is faulty this way: the most mercifull God causing his grace and mercie to be so much the more illustrious and renowned, by how much the sins of his children be more abundant, that where <hi>sinnes abound, there also grace may more abound, Rom.</hi> 5, ver. 20. Which is spoken for ease of an heart, groaning and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly perplexed and humbled with knowledge of sin, &amp; not to open a window vnto iniquity. For the more mercy that any needeth and looketh for, &amp; obtaineth, the lesse cause hee hath to offend, the more reason to please and obey God; as it is written, <hi>There is mercie with thee, O Lord, that thou mayst be feared,</hi> Psalme 130. verse 2.</p>

                  <p>All this may be true as you say, and you say that which being true, is also very heauy. For all relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses be they in bodily or spirituall maladies, are very da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

three fits of seuerall sicknesses, or two or three seuerall woundes in seuerall places of the body, then to haue the selfe-same sicknesse renewed by relapse, and one place of the body twice wounded. Yet all this may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and proue recouerable and curable: else it were wofull with vs all. Who is he that doth not often goe ouer common infirmities? The selfe-same wants and defects which appeare at one time in our duties, those do againe shew themselues at another time: yea, and grosse sinnes are iterated vpon new occasions &amp; temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. <hi>Peter</hi> did thrice deny his Lord, Math. 26, 73, 74. <hi>Abraham</hi> did twice tell a ly, <hi>Lot</hi> was twice ouercom with wine and incontinency, Genes. 19, 31, 32.

                  <p>Faith is not feeling, but apprehension; fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling followes as a fruit of faith, which is in assent, not in sence. What feeling had Christ, when he cried out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me:</hi> and <hi>my soule is heauy to death? Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>and</hi> 27. 46. In your heauinesse and sorrow you are conformed to your head, and other his members; to <hi>Hezekiah mourning as a Doue, and chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering as a Crane, Esay</hi> 38. 14: To <hi>Dauid,</hi> complaining of the disquietnesse of his heart; <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. and confessing that his <hi>teares was the water that washed his Couch; Psal.</hi> 6. 6.

They of whom Christ saide, that <hi>their hearts were slow to beleeue, heauy and dull, and foolish hearts,</hi> yet did beleeue; <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 25. And howsoeuer you thinke all to be full of vnbeleefe, it commeth in you from hence, because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

they had no faith; I might be sooner brought to beleeue them. And would giue them this counsell, that though as yet they beleeue not, yet not to despaire, or cast off hope: for they may beleeue hereafter, so they carefully vse the meanes with waiting vpon God, who calleth at all houres. It is darknes in the night, but at due time the Sunne ariseth: so after darknesse of vnbeleefe, couering the firmament of the heart, there wil arise the Sun shine of liuely faith to all Gods Elect; in the meane time, to feele vnbeleefe, with a mislike of it, and with a desire of faith in Christ, it is a good beginning, as we haue heard hereof in the degrees of faith.</p>

there is an vnion of seueral Natures in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Thus God and man are one Christ.

This<note place="margin">Vnion with Christ, what.</note> vnion is our being one with Christ, and Christ his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with vs, by the band of one Spirit.</p>
                  <p>For plaine places to proue such an vnion, it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,<note place="margin">1.

one soule into another: but it is a spirituall vnion, made in a spirituall manner, and by a spirituall band; an infinite diuine power, creating faith in vs (as an hand) whereby we graspe and take holde on Christ, applying him to vs, that hee may be most neerely ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to vs. As the soule of man conioyneth together the<note place="margin">Simile.</note> head and the foote, which be farre asunder; so the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Spirit of Christ in an vnexpressable manner, by meanes of faith, ioyneth him to vs, and vs to him; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the distance between vs. Whence it is, that though the faithful be ioyned to the very substance of his manhood, as wel as to his godhead, touching the operation and efficacy thereof; yet it is a spirituall vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being from the Spirit as authour, by faith as a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Organ, and to this ende, to leade a spirituall life.</p>

And Iohn 10. 29. <hi>My Father which gaue them me, is greater then all.</hi> Vnto this donation we must adde a second thing, which is a<note place="margin">2 Mutuall consent.</note> mutuall agreement and consent betweene Christ, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3215:68"/>
the soule of an elect sinner, each consenting to be one with the other. Christ comprehends the faithfull soule as his owne, the soule apprehending Christ as her own; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
                  <p>As in marriage, the coniunction betweene man and<note place="margin">Simile.</note> wife is effected, both by the gift of the parents, each gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their children to liue in maried state together, and also by each party agreeing to bee ioyned to the other, and so they twaine become one flesh, and are no more twaine: so it is betweene Christ, and his Church.</p>
                  <p>And now (to your second point) this of marriage<note place="margin">2 Vnion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of Scripture.</note> is one, and the most frequent similitude, whereby the neere coniunction betweene Christ and the faithfull is shadowed out. The whole Booke of <hi>Canticles</hi> alludes<note place="margin">1 Similitude,</note> to this similitude, and by a continuall allegory setteth forth vnder it the most sweet and happy fellowship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Christ and his Church.</p>
                  <p>Againe, in the Gospell, the similitude of a mariage feast is vsed; also <hi>Ephesians</hi> 5. 24, and <hi>Romans 7. verse</hi> 3. 4, 5. and in many other places. And indeed there is no straighter band in humane society, then this of mariage; by the band whereof, and the vertue of Gods institution, they which were before twaine, are now no more so; but (as it were) one body: which light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taketh notice of.</p>
                  <p>Therefore by humane Lawes there lieth no action against the woman, the man being aliue, shee is no person to be sued in Law: so as this fellowship was very apt and meete to declare that most neere vnion which the soule as Spouse hath with Christ as her Husband. For as in mariage, the man communicateth his person, and all his goods whatsoeuer hee hath,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3215:69"/>

And as the woman hath giuen her selfe into the power of the man, shee, and whatsoeuer is hers, be now become her husbands: so it is here likewise, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery beleeuing soule giues her selfe, and all hers againe vnto Christ.</p>
                  <p>The second similitude is of a naturall body, wherein<note place="margin">2 Similitude.</note> the head and the members are well knit and compact together by ioynts &amp; sinewes, which as ligaments and bands doe so linke the members amongst themselues, and to their head; as they, though they be distant one from another, yet being all quickned by one soule, they all make but one body. So it is betweene Christ and the faithfull his members: though they be many, and by place diuided amongst themselues, and all from Christ their head; yet the Spirit of their head, by influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from him, descending into the members, and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening them with the life of grace; they are by that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (as a band) so fastened to their head through faith, and amongst themselues through loue, as that their head and they are mystically, yet truly, but one body, as it is saide; 1 Cor. 12. 12. <hi>As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body which is one, though they be many, yet are but one body: euen so is</hi>

Hitherto also belongeth Eph. 4. 15. <hi>In all things grow vp in him, which is the head, by whom all the body being coupled, &amp;c.</hi> The naturall body then, and

the head is not more one, then Christ and the faithfull. Which is further opened by the similitude of the Vine<note place="margin">3 Simile.</note> and branches, and of grafting and planting grafts into<note place="margin">4 Simile.</note> new stockes; <hi>Iohn</hi> 15, <hi>verse</hi> 1, 2. <hi>&amp;c. Rom. 6. 6.</hi> As also of an house, and the foundation whereon it stands; <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">5 Simile.</note> 2. verse 21, 22. <hi>Christ Iesus is the head corner stone, in whom all the building, &amp;c.</hi> For Christ is as the Vine, we are as the branches; he the noble stocke or roote of <hi>Iesse,</hi> we the grafts; he the corner stone, we the building, laide on him, planted and grafted into him, to be one with him, and to grow vp in him. The necessity of this vnion with Christ, it is very great; so as without it wee are for euer accursed. For by <hi>Adam</hi> wee all fell from God, lost his grace and fauour, his Spirit, his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; being through sinne become the very limmes of Satan, held vnder his power as vassals, and so seruants of sinne, heires of hell and damnation; thus deuoyded of all true life, and bewrapt in the bands of sinne and death, and so remaine, till by vnion with Christ, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer our communion with God, his grace and Spirit, his righteousnesse and life. Hence it is so peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly auouched, that <hi>Christ is the bread which came downe from Heauen, of which whosoeuer eateth not, hath no life</hi>

In which Chapter, these three things are taught about this matter.</p>
                  <p>First, that we must haue vnion with Christ, euen such<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as is betweene the nourishment and our substance. And secondly, that this vnion is wrought by beleeuing in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3215:70"/>
him, by seeing him, by comming to him, by hungering and thirsting after him. And thirdly, that vpon and by this vnion with Christ, wee doe partake in the life of Christ, which being originally in the Deity (as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) <hi>The flesh profiteth not, it is the Spirit that quickeneth:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 6. 25.</note> and againe, <hi>God is life, and that life is in God;</hi> yet it is conueyed into the manhood of Christ, personally vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Godhead; and from his flesh (as from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duite, receiuing grace of life from the fountaine of the Diuinity) it is by the pipe of faith deriued into all his members. To be short, not more needfull that a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall<note place="margin">Simile.</note> member (as hand or foote) be ioyned to the head, that it may liue, haue sense, and motion; or a branch to the Vine conioyned, that it may take iuyce, to fructifie; then it is needfull for the Elect to bee coupled to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, for spirituall life, and euerlasting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

to her. Euen so it is heere in this spirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction: that seeing Christ from his gifts &amp; blessings cannot be diuided, but whosoeuer hath the one, doth most certainly communicate in the other; therefore the elect being vnited to Christ their head, as there flowes from the naturall head to the lowest members power of life, sense, and motion; so from Iesus Christ there is communicated to his spouse, and his body the Church, and to euery member, all his riches and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable treasures, both power of grace, and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of glory. Heere of it being saide, that Christ is made of God to vs, <hi>Wisedome, sanctification, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1, 30. and that God hauing giuen vs Christ, with him will giue vs all things, Rom. 8, 32. and in Iohn 6, 54.

The minde in our creation, was enlightned to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of God, the heart framed to most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling obedience of his known pleasure; there being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought, nor desire, nor affection in man, which agreed not most perfectly to Gods will; our bodies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so being fit instruments to the soule, for fulfilling all
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3215:72"/>
good things rightly desired and embraced of the mind and will. This perfect righteousnesse had perfect hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse ioyned to it, as an vnseparable Companion. Blessednesse can no more bee scuered from perfect<note place="margin">Rom. 4, 4, 5.</note> righteousnesse, then God and heauen can be diuided. Now when <hi>Adam</hi> voluntarily transgressed, he lost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect iustice both for himselfe, and for all that come of him: who are not onely depriued of perfect innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but haue <hi>the guilt of Adams disobedience, to make vs sinners,</hi> Ro. 5, 19. By which meanes, as also by our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall<note place="margin">Man by the fall of Adam, lost blessednes and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and is vnder sin and death,</note> sinnes, wee haue not onely falne from blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but are become the children of Gods wrath, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes. 2, 3. So as we are now plunged into a double euil; one, that for lacke of perfect righteousnesse, wee are spoiled of all blisse, hauing no interest in heauenly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and ioy: the other, that thorough the guilt of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> and our owne disobedience to the Law, wee are subiect to euerlasting misery and paine in hell. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we stand in neede of a double grace from Christ; one, whereby wee may escape damnation in hell; the other, whereby we may finde entrance into Heauen. In which two things, consists that saluation by Christ whereof so much and comfortable mention is made in Scripture.

That <hi>hee was obedient to his Father to the death of the Crosse:</hi> for obedience is shewed no lesse to God in suffering what he will, then in doing what he wil; and so our Sauiour approued himselfe and his obedience in suffering (as all other euils which were sent vnto him in the whole course of his life) hunger, thirst, cold, wearinesse, contempt, reproch, pouerty,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3215:73"/>
want, banishment, conflict with beasts, with Sathan, outward troubles, inward temptations; yet especially those last and greatest euils and afflictions which at and about the time of his crucifying and sacrifice were for mans sinne inflicted vpon him in soule and body, either immediately from the hand of his most irefull highly offended Father, or mediately from the Diuell and wicked men, Iewes and Gentiles outragiously conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and working him all the smart and shame possible could be put vpon him; whatsoeuer euill, diuine iustice would, or hellish malice could heape vpon him, and he was capable of, that, and all that, he (as our surety) in humble submission to his Father did endure for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. The which his passiue righteousnesse consisting in his willing and constant obedience of his manhood vnder the Crosse, hath receiued such sufficiency of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and worthinesse from his godhead (to which it is personally vnited) for the deseruing and purchasing for all his Elect, that most notable benefit which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures commonly call remission or forgiuenesse of sins: Which is an vtter acquitting and deliuering of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers from all guilt come vpon them by their owne, or <hi>Adams</hi> sinne imputed; and from all punishment due to them for the same, either in this World, or in the next.

Insomuch as howsoeuer many and great tribulations doe chance to befall them in their life time, and death in the end seaze vpon the godly, yet these happen vnto them as no part of Gods curse for sinne, or as fruites of his fury and hot indignation; but quite contrary, the crosses of their life being sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Christ his Crosse, they are great furtherances to<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. ver. 32, 33.</note> mortification and amendment of life, and good trials of<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.</note> their faith &amp; patience, and nourishments of their hope:<note place="margin">Rom. 5, verse 3. 4, 5.</note> and death when it comes, hauing lost his sting, there is nothing remaining in it which is not beneficial to them; it being but as a bridge or gate to carry them ouer, and conuey them into their heauenly Countrey.

Therefore no more surely was <hi>Adam</hi> shut out of earthly Paradise, then we his posterity for lacke of perfect iustice, are excluded out of the third heauens, the Paradise which is aboue. Therefore as Iesus Christ our Mediatour by bearing the whole punishment due

to the breach of the Law, with most sincere obedience, hath enfreed vs from the curse and destruction of hell; so by keeping &amp; doing all duties toward God and man required in the Law, and that in most perfect, loue, he hath by this his <hi>actiue</hi> obedience merited, and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for his people a right and title to the Kingdome of Heauen.

Hence called the <hi>immaculate Lambe, vndefiled, separate from sinners;</hi> and so he behoued to be, that hee might offer himselfe a spotlesse sacrifice to God, who vnder the Law would admit no blemished oblation. Had ought in his nature been neuer so little crooked and vnright, his death had no more auayled for remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or his life for righteousnesse, then the death or life of <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> or any other Saint: for then himselfe needing a Sauiour, should not haue beene ours.</p>
                     <p>The other part of his actiue obedience, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of his actions with the holinesse of the Law,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3215:74"/>
which in the course of his life, hee kept and fulfilled: doing all that was commanded in both Tables, &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">1.

Also, doing all this to a<note place="margin">3 To a right] end.</note> right end, that he might honor his Father, whose glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he sought in all things.

                     <p>Hence it is, that this righteousnes which Christ in his manhood hath thus performed (as we haue saide) is often in the Epistles of <hi>Paul,</hi> termed the <hi>righteousnes of God,</hi> as Rom. 3, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <head>Iustification, what it is.</head>
                  <p>Amongst sundry significations of this word Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (which I meane not now to meddle with) there be three especially to bee obserued: One is,<note n="*" place="margin">As sanctifie, to make holie: rectify, to make right: mollifye, to make soft: glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, to make glorious, &amp;c.</note> to make iust, which except it be with some commodious inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, doth not agree to this matter wee haue in hand (for we are not made iust by a iustice in our selues or in our persons.) Secondly, it importeth as much as to declare, shew foorth, and allow for good and iust, that which before was so: as in that saying, <hi>Wisedome is iustified of her children,</hi> Luke 16, 15. Againe, the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans iustified God, Luke 10, 29. And in <hi>Iames</hi> 2. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is sayd <hi>to be iustified</hi> (declared such) <hi>by his Workes.</hi> In a third signification, to iustify, it is (according to the vse and custome of speaking among the Hebrewes) to absolue one from guilt, and to pronounce him inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. As in all these places, where Iustification is set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst condemning; as in the Prouerbes, <hi>He that iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the wicked, or that condemneth the innocent, both are like abhomination, &amp;c.</hi> And Rom. 8. <hi>who shall condemne, it is God that iustifieth,</hi> and Acts 13, 39. <hi>All that beleeue in him, are iustified from all those things, &amp;c.</hi> and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the like places. It is a word borrowed by the holy Ghost from Courts of ciuill Iustice; where such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accused, and are found guiltlesse, they bee by the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3215:76"/>
mouth of the Iudge, absolued and pronounced inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                  <p>In this third signification, we vse the word here when we speake of the iustification of an elect sinner by faith; not for infusion of iustice into vs, whereby wee should be made iust by an inherent righteousnesse of our own, nor for the declaration of our iustice before men: but for the absoluing of a sinner from his guilt of sinne, and the accounting or pronouncing him iust before the tribunall of God. In which sence, the worde is taken without all exception to the contrary, in Acts 13, 39, where it is written, <hi>Through this man is preached to you forgiuenesse of sin, and from all things from which ye could not be iustified by the Law of Moses, by him euery one that beleeueth, is iustified.</hi> Which words, in good and right interpretation, can haue no other meaning then this; That whereas by the Law, by the workes and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies thereof, men could not be acquitted and assoyled from their sinnes, yet by Iesus Christ (so we by a liuely faith lay hold on him) we shall bee absolued from our sinnes, before the iudgement of Almighty God. And in this selfesame meaning doth the blessed Apostle vse this word throughout his disputation of this matter, in his Epistles to the Romanes and Galathians; so as now it will be no hard thing to shew, what benefite our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification is.</p>
                  <p>Iustification of an elect sinner before God, it is an<note place="margin">Iustification what it is: An imputation of Christs whole righteousnesse to the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing man.</note> action of the most mercifull God, freely (according to his couenant of grace) absoluing him at what time he beleeueth, from his sinnes, before his Tribunall, by the passiue righteousnesse or sufferings of his Son impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and an accounting or pronouncing him for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3215:76"/>
iust by the actiue righteousnesse of Christ, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted also vnto such a beleeuing sinner. For the fuller vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding<note place="margin">1 Imputation.</note> hereof, we are to note, that in this worke of Iustification, there is a two-fold action of God to be considered. One is an imputation or reckoning of all our sinnes, and the whole punishment thereof vnto Christ, vpon whom as our surety or husband they were put by the decree of his Father, and his owne election; that he by bearing them, might so acquit vs from them. The second is an imputation or reckoning of Christ his whole righteousnesse, both passiue and actiue to vs, for the forgiuenesse of sinnes by the merit of the former; and the acceptation of vs as absolutely righteous in his sight for the merit of the latter. Euen as in a marriage, where a Noble man marrieth a begger, there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change made.</p>
                  <p>The nobility and riches of the Husband, is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the Wife, and her meannesse or extreme po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty is now esteemed his, or at least extinguished in his greatnesse; so it fareth here. All our faults and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were by imputation of God the Father so put v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his Sonne, as if they had beene his owne; he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted<note place="margin">Esay 53.</note> a sinner, yea, made a sinner by it, and <hi>the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements</hi>

                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5, verse last.</note> 
                     <hi>for vs:</hi> and on the other side, the whole righteousnesse of Christ, both in his keeping the Law, and in his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring paine and death for the breach of it, is so beeome and made ours by imputation, as if wee in our owne person had suffered and fulfilled all. So as a mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and soule is no more his owne, his sicknesse or health is no more his owne, then vpon Gods imputation, the passion and obedience of Christ are ours for our Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3215:77"/>
For as <hi>Adams</hi> disobedience done in his owne person, is yet the fault of all his Progeny, euen to the<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 19.</note> subiecting them vnto death by Gods imputing it vnto them: so is the obedience of Christ in his nature, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and sufferings, though it sticke inherently in his manhood; yet it is verily ours for forgiuenesse of sinnes, and for our accounting righteous by Gods imputation of it vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>The reason why this imputation is so requisite in<note place="margin">Of imputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Reade Rom. 4.</note> the worke of our iustification, it is apparent, because the righteousnesse of Christ being without vs in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Christ, it can no otherwise become ours for the absoluing vs from our sinnes, and getting vs to be accepted as iust in Gods sight, then by a free impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it vnto vs. God accounting all the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse<note place="margin">The merit of right is eternal life.</note> of his Sonne vnto the elect sinner to be his owne, with the whole merit of it, at what time hee beleeueth on his Sonne by a liuely and true faith.</p>
                  <p>And this the Scripture plentifully and plainely tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,<note place="margin">2 Faith. These two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions meete both together at one time, God then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting and imputing all Christs iustice to a sinner when he truly beleeueth.</note> that as on Gods part there is this action of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting Christ his iustice vnto vs, so on our part there is required faith to beleeue the promise hereof made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by his Sonne. Therefore it is so often saide, that <hi>we are iustified by faith;</hi> and Christ his righteousnesse is called, <hi>the righteousnesse of faith,</hi> in many Texts of <hi>Paul</hi> his Epistles. Which is not so to be taken, as if either faith were a part of righteousnesse, which is wholy in Christ his doings and sufferings; or as if the quality and action of faith did deserue remission of sinnes (for<note place="margin">Rom. 4, verse 22, 23, 24.</note> it is vnperfect, as all other graces are in vs, and it selfe with the weake action of beleeuing, needeth pardon from God;) neither as any mouing cause of our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse:

Chapters to the <hi>Romans,</hi> laid forth the doctrine of Iustification, and very substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally proued it to be not by our workes, which we doe, not onely for that we are all sinners, but because they answer not the iustice of the Law, no, not in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, which haue most grace, and doe most good: but by faith, apprehending the sufferings and death of Christ, full absolution from sinne, and his actiue obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law for our perfect iustice with God.

                     <p>Of these foresaide effects, I do desire now to heare you speake some-what in that order as they are named. And first, touching peace with God, what do ye vnderstand thereby, make it plaine to me what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of gift that is.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>These fruites of iustifying faith being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">First fruite of iustification by Faith.</note> (nine in number) I had not neede to be long in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we hauing so much other worke yet behinde: And yet being both weighty matters, and remoued from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vnderstanding, I cannot well tell how to speake briefly, lest I speak not plainly enough; but this easeth me of some care, that these things are spoken vnto one that hath them, and feeleth them by good experience: and therefore can sooner comprehend the nature and truth of these worthy gifts.</p>
                     <p>Now touching the first of them it is peace with God, whereby two things are meant. First, reconciliation or<note place="margin">1. Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> truce with God; in which sence, the word is vsed in<note place="margin">Esay 0, 6.</note> those Scriptures where Christ is termed our peace, the<note place="margin">Ephes. 2, 14.</note> Prince of peace, our peace-maker: and peace is made<note place="margin">Colos. 1, 20.</note> by his blood, that is, attonement or reconcilement<note place="margin">What it is.</note> with God, whiles our sinnes which bredde an enmity betweene God &amp; vs, and made a separation of vs from him, and of him from vs (his infinite iustice hating our
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3215:81"/>
sinnes, and we through sinne extreamly hating God) the guilt of these sinnes and punishment, being wholy done away, &amp; freely pardoned by the merit of Christ his death, we haue now God pacified towards vs, &amp; of a more then terrible Iudge, becom a most amiable and kinde Father, taking vs now for sonnes by grace, who were children of his wrath before.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, from this peace and reconciliation made<note place="margin">2. Peace of conscience.</note> with God, our faith accepting the mercy &amp; forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by his gracious promise freely offered, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth<note place="margin">What.</note> another peace and happy tranquility of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which (the woundes and terrors of it being now healed and quieted vpon that blessed consent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Gods promise and our faith) instead of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and trobling, as it was wont, doth now excuse and acquite vs before God with vnspeakable rest; so as in the sense of Gods pacification towards vs, wee are not greatly terrified with sinne and other enemies of our saluation: and though there be some agreement &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse betweene this true peace of a good conscience, &amp; that false peace of a dead and benummed conscience, inasmuch as both are quiet and free from trouble or anguish, yet there is in other respects as great ods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them as is betweene heauen and hell.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For first, a dead conscience is quiet, because it<note place="margin">2 How it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from false peace of the wicked.</note> hath no feeling of sinne at all: like to dead flesh, which you may prick with a Needle, and yet it feels nothing; so is it with a sleeping dead conscience, it hath no sense of sinne or iudgment, and thence growes the quietnes it hath, which will quickly be shaken off, and horrible terror succeede in the roome with sin reuiueth. And it is awaked by the knowledge and due consideration of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3215:81"/>
the Law of God. But an holy conscience washed in the blood of Christ, it is quiet, because it so feeleth sinnes, as it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> them al forgiuen, and God pacified and well pleased in his Son. Hence ariseth her peace which passeth all vnderstanding.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, a benummed conscience, though it be quiet, yet it comforteth not, but lyeth as asleepe: there may be in the heart naturall liuelinesse and comfort, by presence of things pleasing to nature, but no spirituall comfort in the conscience at all: whereas the truly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified conscience hath great comfort in it selfe, chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp the soule as a man is cheared at a feast, a good conscience is a continuall feast.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, the benummed conscience is awlesse &amp; feareth not the offence of God by sinne, nor his wrath for sinne. Whereas the truely appeased conscience is fearefull to offend such a Father: though it now feare not damnation, which is taken away by faith in Christ; yet it feareth transgression &amp; breach of the Law, as it is written of <hi>Iob,</hi> that he feared alwayes, and of <hi>

                     <speaker>Aquila.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, may it please you ere you passe ouer to<note place="margin">2 How peace of conscieuce is to be got.</note> the next fruite: First, to shewe how this blessing of a peaceable conscience is gotten, and how to be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; and also whether and how farre it may be lost, and what is to be done to recouer it?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Apollos.</speaker>
                     <p>There are two wayes vvhereby to attaine this peace. First, by an vnfeigned displeasure &amp; sorow conceyued in our hearts against our owne sinnes, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forth in an humble, sincere, and constant confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them particularly, so far as they are knowne, with an earnest endeauour against them, to shun all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3215:82"/>
of them. Secondly, by stirring vp the heart to embrace that promise of the Gospell, which offereth to vs the forgiuenesse of them, verily beleeuing them to be indeede remitted to vs from God, according to that his mercifull promise, which hee can no more breake, then he can denie himselfe: for he is true, and cannot lie. Now hauing thus gotten this peace of mind, there must great care be taken for the preseruation of it; seeing it is no lesse praise to keepe a treasure, then at first to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase<note place="margin">4 How pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.</note> it. And it is to be kept euen by the same meanes by which it was come by, euen by often and earnest confession of our sinnes, and crauing pardon thereof, and by beleeuing the truth of the promise; but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by a carefull auoiding of euery knowne sinne, euen the least, labouring still as to get a cleerer insight of sins by the lanterne of the Law; so as they are more bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known and perceiued to encrease in care and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse ouer our hearts, to stop the course of sin in the very thoughts and desires; where sinne being yet but young and weake, may most easily be crushed: neuer let it goe so farre, as to get consent of the will to agree to the motion of it, much lesse the helpe either of tongue or hand, or other part of the body to execute it; for then it will raise vp new stormes, and trouble the quiet peace of the soule. Hereunto ioyne a desire and study how to performe all knowne duties which concerne vs in our generall or speciall calling, with all vprightnesse and singlenesse of heart, as in Gods sight, out of loue to please him, and true desire to glorifie him by our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his will. For great is the peace that they haue which <hi>walke in his Statutes,</hi> saith the Psalmist. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which we cannot doe perfectly, let vs striue to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3215:82"/>
doe sincerely, and aske forgiuenesse of our imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and so it will come to passe, that our peace will not onely stand to vs, but encrease daily, and more abound in vs.</p>
                     <p>Whereas you desire to know touching this peace, if it may be lost: To this I answer you, it cannot be lost; none can take it away, no more then reconciliation with God, or faith can be lost. Indeede this peace of<note place="margin">5. How farre lost.</note> conscience, as touching the sense and feeling of it, may be, and sometime is lost; as appeareth both in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Scripture, as in <hi>Iob, Dauid, Ezekiah,</hi> and by the experience of others in these our dayes, who either by falling into some grosse actuall sinne, or by some<note place="margin">6. By what meanes lost.</note> fearefull security, not looking to, and watching ouer theirwayes, or by some strong fit of temptation, haue beene for a time in an hell of horror and soule-sorrow, hauing no more sence of peace, then a man vpon a racke doth feele any ease; complaining in the anguish and bitternesse of their griefe, that the terrour of God hath beene vpon them, that their soule hath beene dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietted within them, that they were cast out of Gods sight, mourning as a Turtle, chattering as a Crane, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and watering their cheekes and couch with teares; weary of life, wishing for death, finding nothing but feare on euery side; yet all this while their liuely faith, the remission of their sinnes, their atonement with God, and the blessed peace of minde comming thereof, not vtterly lost; but the sense onely of these benefits taken away, it faring with them as with the Sunne, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnder the darke cloudes, yet is still in it selfe a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some creature, and when it hath power to scatter the thicke cloudes, giueth forth his shine afresh; or as the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3215:83"/>
trees in Winter, which hauing neither fruite, nor blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, nor leafe, seeme to be dead; yet haue life in the roote, which appeareth in the Spring. Or finally, as with a man in a trance, who in truth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, though for the time he haue no sense or vse of life; euen so it is with Gods owne Children in the pang of some soule affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or after some deepe fall by sinne, there appeares in them for a season no fruits, nor feeling of any sauing grace, but all is clouded, and dead to seeming; yet not so in truth, as both reason and the euent declareth. For all sauing grace is of that nature, as it perisheth not; it neuer dyeth, where it once liueth, therefore called im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall. And such as for a season haue feare and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and dulnesse, with deadnesse in their conscience, they doe afterwards recouer themselues; the graces which seemed to be dead, being stirred vp by the vse of good meanes, are againe quickened. And the best<note place="margin">How recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> meanes for such as haue lost their former peace, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching all sense of it, they are priuate prayer to God, though it be with great vntowardnesse, yea, though they be troubled, when they thinke on God; yet still to make petitions vnto him in his Sonnes name. Those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry groanes and sighes which are so little, as they cannot be vttered what they are; yet being the worke of Christ<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> his Spirit, they are through the same Christ pleasing to God, who despiseth not <hi>a contrite and broken heart;</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Psal. 51. 17.</note> let not such forbeare to come, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For this being Gods ordinance, to pray one for another,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3215:83"/>
and to confesse our sinnes one to another; <hi>Iames</hi> 5. cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely God will blesse it to the good of his Children. Therefore let such take good heart to them, and for their better releefe of their distressed conscience, let them remember the olde mercies of God toward them, and what peace, ioy, and comfort, they haue had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore in God; and other the workes of his grace, which they haue felt, must assure them, that that God which once had so farre exprest his loue towards them, will be their God for euer. These priuate meanes ioyned with the publike, namely, the reuerent vse of the Word and mysteries, will againe so settle their heart in peace, (through Gods powerfull blessing) as that they shall be occasioned to say with the Prophet; <hi>Returne to thy rest, O my soule, for the Lord hath beene beneficiall to thee; hee hath deliuered thy soule from death, and thy eyes from teares;</hi> Psal. 116. verse 7, 8.</p>

quicken and prouoke Gods children to all Christian care and watchfulnesse; both because the faithfull are so preserued of God in the estate of Grace, as that the same word which teacheth this, doth teach also, that their owne feare, endeuour, and vigilancy in the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vse of all good meanes, and in diligent heed-taking to all their owne wayes, is required heereunto, as the means of their standing. <hi>Let him that standeth, take heed lest he fall,</hi> 1 Cor. 10, 12.

                     <p>Now I would gladly heare you speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the fift fruit of our iustification by faith, which ye called (after the Apostle) a <hi>Reioycing vnder the hope of the glory of God.</hi> Where if it please you, I wold haue you distinctly to shew mee these three things. First, what he meaneth by the glory of God. Secondly, then what is the hope thereof. And lastly, of reioycing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that hope; so this fifte fruite will bee euidenced to me the better what it is.</p>

                     <p>In all these I will seeke to satisfie you, and<note place="margin">5. Fruit of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, hope of glorie</note> that with so few words as such things may well be vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The glory spoken of, Rom. 5, 2. it is that blessed<note place="margin">1. Glorie of God.</note> celestiall glory which beleeuers shall enioy in Heauen with God; and it consistes first in a remoouing from them all manner of sinne and miserie, from which they<note place="margin">Reuel. 7, 21.</note> shall be absolutely free: the euill of sin and paine shall touch them no more then it shall touch God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in the presence and hauing of al good for soule and body, and that in all perfection: their bodies being made incorruptible, strong, bright, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as the Starres or Sunne in the Firmament; their soules filled with holinesse, abounding in all loue of God, his Angels and Saintes: and God mutually lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and delighting in them. And all this, as without measure, so without all terme or end. Earehath not heard, eye hath not seene, heart cannot conceiue and thinke of the greatnesse of this glory. None know it, saue such as receiue it. This is called the glory of God, not only in this regard, for that it is his free gift which hee bestoweth on his sonnes and daughters: but also for that himselfe liues in it, and is infinitely cloathed with this celestial glory. He dwels in inaccessible glory, his children being made partakers of some beames of it, as they are capable, yet so farre as to their absolute felicity for euer.</p>
                     <p>For the second thing, what may bee the hope of<note place="margin">2. Hope of Glory.</note> that glory. It is that certaine and sure expectation of the beleeuing iustified soule, to enioy in due time this heauenly glory, and whatsoeuer serues to leade there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as it is certaine of such good things, as it enioyeth<note place="margin">3 Why it is certaine.</note> already. For, seeing the faithfull do hope for heauenly
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3215:87"/>
glory, and their hope shall not make them ashamed, Rom. 5, 5. therefore they may surely, and with certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, expect eternall glory in heauen. Otherwise, their hope would bring shame and confound them, if they should misse of the thing hoped for.</p>
                     <p>Againe, the beleeuers are said, to <hi>reioyce vnder this glory,</hi> Rom. 5, 2. Now there is no reioycing with godly wise men, but in things of certainty which be assured. There is therefore certainty in their hope, otherwise how could they pray vnto God, and call him Father? For his children shall certainly be saued, and they may certainly looke for it: and how could faith be a certain perswasion of the truth of the promise, if hope were but an vncertain and wauering looking for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the thing promised? Finally, hope stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it selfe vpon the infinite truth, mercy, and power of God, which cannot deceiue, alter, or faile; therefore Christian hope of glorious happinesse is no opinion, but a very certaine and steddy expectation.</p>

                     <p>Sir, let me heere interrupt you a little with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your offence. Seeing the nature of hope is but to looke for something which as yet wee haue not, and is to be had heereafter, as the Apostle, Rom. 8. argueth, to wit, when he saith, <hi>Hope which is seene is no hope, wee hope for such things as we see not:</hi> whence then is that certainty and assurance which is affixed and ioyned vnto hope, there being many things hoped for to bee had of vs heereafter, which yet men neuer haue?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Apollos.</speaker>
                     <p>Neighbour <hi>Aquila,</hi> this was well &amp; time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mooued. For certainty is not of the nature of hope,<note place="margin">4. How cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty comes to be ioyned to hope.</note> which being generally taken, and in it owne nature, is no more then as you haue saide, an expecting of some
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3215:87"/>
future thing which is yet for to come; therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty or vncertainety goeth with hope, according to the nature of the things hoped for; which if they haue contingent causes, so as they may come to passe or not, then the hope of such things is euer with vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and no better then a doubtfull opinion. Hence it is, that humane or ciuill hope, which is of worldlie things (which haue no certaine causes, but may be or not be) is euer with doubt and vnassured. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: when one hath promised to come to my house such a time to make merry with me, or to pay me mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, I may say, I hope such a man thus promising, will come at the appointed time, but this hope ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not make me sure. For vpon good cause he may alter his mind, or fall sicke, or my selfe may haue necessary lets. But now it is otherwise with Christian hope, which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and assoreth a man of the things hoped for; as spiritual blessings, and protection on earth, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall glory in heauen. Which things, because they are very certaine, proceeding of most certaine causes, as the vnchangeable mercy and truth of God, purposing and promising eternal life, with all things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long thereunto, and bring thither: and hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready giuen the elect in the worke of their calling, and iustifying them by faith, in pacifying their consciences by the feeling of their sinnes forgiuen, and allowing them accesse into his grace, and by other fruites of his couenant, sure demonstration, and experimentall knowledge of his truth and mercy: Hence it is, that they may with vndoubted certainty, and doe assuredly looke for that which is yet behinde, euen their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perfection in heauen. And notwithstanding there
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3215:88"/>
bee in them still remaining corruption, by strength whereof, they often faile and offend by many, &amp; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time very great sins, yea and their owne will is change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: yet seeing it is so, that vnto beleeuers repenting, all sinnes are forgiuen; and God himselfe neuer chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth: howsoeuer his children are subiect therunto, yet he so reneweth them, as he confirmeth their will, and putteth strength into them by the might of his grace, that though they may change &amp; cease to trust in God, yet they are kept from it. Hence it is, for all the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their iniquities, and mutablenes of their mind, that their hope is neuer vtterly quailed &amp; danted, but standeth firme as mount Syon, or as an hill of Brasse, so as not onely for the present, but euer for hereafter, their hope shall be firme and good. Which truth, as it much correcteth the error of them, which seuer assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from hope of glory, &amp; make of it but an opinion and wauering conceite, as of a thing which they may haue or misse of (a thing not to bee meruailed, seeing some in part at least, ground their hope vpon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of workes, and vpon their seruing of GOD, weake grounds to beare vp certaine expectation of glory:) so it ministreth much comfort to the faithful, which haue receiued this Christian hope, insomuch as whatsoeuer their afflictions, enemies, or sinnes be, yet they cannot misse of glorious blisse in the end. For God is faithful which hath promised; and hauing also begun a good worke in them, hee will finish it vntill the day of Iesus Christ. Finally, whosoeuer hath this hope of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, let him purge himselfe, euen as hee is pure. For, if we looke for such a glory as is heauenly, wee ought to be very diligent, that wee may bee found of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3215:88"/>
him in peace, without spot and blamelesse.</p>

                     <p>You haue satisfied me in this fifth fruite of hope, and by that which you haue deliuered, I doe well obserue how three sorts of persons be hugely deceiued. The first is of them who in some part doe build their hope vpon their owne good doings, who must needes alwayes floate as a boate vpon the water, with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall vncertainties and doubtings of their saluation; for that they can neuer be sure when their workes are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and when they be free from being in some mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall sinne, doe still perplex their hearts; beside the great sinnes which they commit against God, in whom alone the hope of his children is to be fixed, as an anchor in the bottome of the water, insomuch as they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced accursed, which hope in ought saue God: and mens workes they are not good, therefore popish hope is an accursed hope. Indeede good workes, and a iust and godly life, may be vnto the Saints a secondary helpe, and as it were some prop to stay their hope, in this regard, that to such persons as liue so, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of eternall life made: but God his infinite mercy, trueth, and his Almightinesse, manifested in the death and resurrection of his Sonne, is the true and onely foundation of hope. <hi>Thankes be vnto God</hi> (saith Saint<note place="margin">1 Peter 1. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Peter) who hath begotten vs to a liuely hope, through the resurrection of Christ from the dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second sort is of such, as in their ignorance or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> mistaking, thinke and speake no otherwise of Christian hope, then of humane and worldly hope; as if their hope of glory had no more certainty in it, then hath their hope of a faire day, when they see the morning cleere; or of a good haruest, when they see corne come
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3215:89"/>
vp in the blade, and well eared, being herein not right, though they little suspect so much by themselues.</p>
                     <p>The third sort is of such, as hauing better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the truth of this doctrine touching the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of hope, yet faile herein, that they doe not labour to expresse the power of a true liuely hope, in the purging of themselues, their hearts and liues from filthinesse of sinne, that they may become such as God in mercy will accept as meet and fit to enter into that vndefiled inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, which they say, they certainely by hope doe looke for. But now Sir hauing dispatcht this fifth fruit of <hi>the hope of glory,</hi> if it seeme good to you, set vpon the next, the sixth fruite; <hi>Reioycing vnder this hope,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Peter 1.</note> which is elsewhere called, ioy in the Spirit, or ioy of the<note place="margin">Psalme 51.</note> holy Ghost, and ioy vnspeakable and glorious, and ioy of saluation; I would haue you open this to me.</p>

                     <p>Ioy, or reioycing, generally taken, it is a<note place="margin">6. Fruite of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</note> sweete motion of the heart vpon the presence, or hope<note place="margin">Ioy spirituall.</note> of some good thing. Now as good things (which are the obiects of ioy) be diuers, so reioycing is diuers. If the good thing bee such as doe tend to the pleasing or preseruing of our Nature, the ioy which is taken in it is fleshly and worldly, such as reprobates &amp; wicked men of all sorts may haue. But the reioycing, which is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to a beleeuing iustified person, it ariseth, and is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by heauenly and spirituall graces and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, either presently had and enioyed; as calling to Christ, remission of sinnes, reconciliation with God, peace of conscience, repentance, the graces of the new man, faith, hope, loue, &amp;c. or else certainly hoped for, as eternall blisse and glory in Heauen. Hence in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures termed, <hi>Ioy of the Spirit;</hi> not onely because it is
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:3215:89"/>
wrought by the Spirit, but because spirituall blessings are the obiect of it. And herein differeth Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing from worldly, that as this springeth from the hauing and presence of earthly and perishing good things of this life, and therefore lasteth not, but is sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly quailed vpon the change of estate, and losse of temporall good things, and euer it endeth in bitter sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: Contrariwise, the reioycing of the faithfull, it is lasting, and cannot be taken away, such as cheereth the heart euen in afflictions, as we shal heare anon; because it commeth from a sence of Gods present fauour, and the present enioying of many excellent heauenly fruits thereof, and an assured expectation of full blessednesse to come: their hearts being truly certified by the holy Spirit, and assured by faith, that as they now haue God propitious and gracious towards them, for the free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of all their sinnes; so the day will come, when all corruption of sinnes quite done away, and all teares for sinne and misery being wiped from their eyes, at a word, when all euill being vtterly remoued from them, they shall be perfectly blessed and glorified with God; in which hope they reioyce, and comfort their hearts, lauding and praysing God with Psalmes. The which their spirituall ioy comming from the feeling of Gods fauour, and the looking for of Gods glory, is a part of Gods Kingdome, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>The Kingdome of God is righteousnesse, peace, &amp; ioy in the holy Ghost.</hi> And therefore of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> called, <hi>Gloriousioy;</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. Vnto which the Apostle therefore earnestly exhorteth the faithfull, <hi>Reioyce in the Lord:</hi> Againe, <hi>I say reioyce;</hi> Phil. 4. 4. And <hi>Reioyce euermore;</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 16. And this <hi>Dauid</hi> begs,<note place="margin">Ioy by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> 
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. <hi>Make me to heare of ioy and gladnesse.</hi> Where
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:3215:90"/>
obserue this, that ioy is begotten by the promise of the Gospell being heard. Let mee heare euen by that glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some ioyfull tydings of forgiuenesse by Christ, how it is nourished and encreased by that meanes; and being at any time ouershadowed (as it falleth out sometime with Gods deare Children, that the sunne of their ioy is hid vnder a blacke cloude of sinnes and temptations) then it is recouered and had again by the word of faith, by the message and testimony of forgiuenesse of sinnes, being yours, and beleeued; therefore it is that <hi>Dauid</hi> prayes to heare of ioy. For when the ioy of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian heart is turned into bitter greefe, there is nothing wil cheere and glad it sauing the promises of the Word. <hi>I had vtterly fainted in my trouble, had not'thy Word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted me; Psal.</hi> 119. All other solaces which wee vse to follow, for the cheering of our spirit made sad with sinne, are vaine and nothing worth. It is the word of promise, onely through the working of that Spirit of comfort, that can fetch againe a fainting spirit, or keepe it in ioyfull plight without fainting. Therefore as God must be sought to for this ioy when any lacke it, so hee must be waited on in his Word for the obtaining and encrease of it. For sithence both faith, and hope of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, are bred and fed by the hearing of the Word of the Gospell; by the same way our reioycing, the fruite of our hope, is to be gotten, and preserued. But that wee may not stay too long about any one thing, hauing so many things to speak of; we are to vnderstand that this former reioycing of a Christian heart, vnder hope of Gods glory, doth bring forth another branch of reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, farre more admirable; and that is, reioycing in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">7. Ioy in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations.</note> tribulations, which are greeuous to our Nature: for

this is not so much to be maruelled at, if true beleeuers haue their hearts mooued to ioy and gladnes, because they certainly looke to bee glorified with God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; for the hope of farre lesse matters vseth to cheere vp mens hearts: but this is indeede very wonderfull, that afflictions, which haue in them matter both of shame and pain, yea and carry a shew of God displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and angry with vs, that yet the godly beleeuers should be merry and cheerefull in the feeling of them: this (I say) is strange, yet it is most certainly true: the Apostle affirming of them, who be iustified by Faith, <hi>That they reioyce euen in tribulations:</hi> Rom. 5. 3. and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience proueth to vs the truth heereof: The godly in their affliction, euen in most bitter martyrdom, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the spoyling of their goods and liues with ioy. The reason is, because the afflictions proceeding from Gods loue and speciall fauour (as the faithfull are well perswaded, being reconciled to him) and for an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall good end, to try and encrease their faith; therefore their afflictions do nourish in them the hope of their glory (as seales and pledges thereof vnto them,) assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them that rest will come after their troubles, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods faithfull promise. Now the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that rest and happinesse (in hope whereof they liue) causeth all things to be sweete and pleasant vnto them, which they meete with in their way, &amp; as part of their way, by which they are to passe, toward that glorious and happie end. They being not a little comforted heerewith in their greatest distresses and troubles, to know, that beeing now made partakers with Christ and his afflictions, suffering and dying with him, they haue the Lords owne worde for their
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:3215:91"/>
warrant, that they shall also liue and reigne with him in glory. So as with consideration of these things, namely, their conformity with Christ; and that their light and momentany sufferings, shall be turned into a glory immortall and weighty: hence it is, that loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for it, &amp; looking vpon it, and not vpon their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall calamities, they are very comfortable and cora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; the ioy of good things to come swallowing (at lest mitigating) much the greefe of euil things present.</p>

                     <p>Sir, you might now (as I thinke) proceede vnto the two last pointes of Iustification, but that I would intreat you to loose two or three knots. One is, whether Gods children may imbrace worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. And the second is, sithence the hope of glorie breeds in them such ioy, euen to the solacing &amp; glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their hearts in most irkesome and painfull suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, how commeth it, that sometimes some of the best and most faithfull men, do strangely despaire, and are not onely without hope and ioy, but exceedingly appalled and danted, despairing, and full of discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Apollos.</speaker>
                     <p>Good friend, albeit something hath (by occasion) bene said to this point twice or thrice here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore (if ye remember) when wee spake of peace of conscience, and of standing in grace, and else-where: yet I will answer your demand, touching the despaires of the faithfull, if first I speake somewhat of worldly<note place="margin">Of worldly ioy.</note> comforts: which as it pleaseth God sometime to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford his owne children, and that in a good measure, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them also power to apprehend them: so there is great feare and danger of being deceiued by them, as we see in the wofull examples of <hi>Salomons</hi> fall, and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiahs</hi>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:3215:91"/>
sinne, and sundry others, which haue lost the sense of spirituall ioy, by being too much caried away with worldly ioyes, not keeping a measure in them. Therefore, Gods children are to bee admonished of these few things, about their ioy in earthlie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. First, that simply considered, it is common vnto<note place="margin">Rules and cautions for worldly ioy.</note> them, not onely with the vngodly, but euen with sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall beasts, who are delighted when they haue things liking to their nature. Thus wee see the Calues and Lambs to skip and sport themselues, &amp; the very horse reioyce, when he hath good prouender.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, too much worldly ioy, when the hart<note place="margin">Let Salomons example proue this, &amp; cause the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to feare worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</note> is much and often cheered with pleasures of life, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perillous; a great enemy to godlinesse, hauing bene the baite wherein many a good soule hath bin caught; so as there needs great caution to be taken, about the well vsing of it, especially it being so hard for vs to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne either our passions of greefe or ioy, of feare or loue.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, therefore prayer is to bee made vnto God to guide them in their mirth, and to enable them to obserue a due measure therin, that the heart be not deceiued thereby.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourthly, in the midst of mirth and worldly ioy, when the heart beginnes to cheare much, some sin of our life committed, or some iudgement of God which we haue bene vnder for sinne, or some threatning of the word against some of our sinnes, would bee called to minde, to checke the immoderatenesse of our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and so to temper and take down our mirth, that it be not with excesse.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="164" facs="tcp:3215:92"/>5. Fiftly, as Chirurgeons are faine in some cases, to diuert the course of blood for the healths of their patients; so let Christians endeuour to turne theyr worldly mirth into a godly spirituall mirth, by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering with themselues seriously, that those earthlie pleasures and worldly comforts wherein their heart is delighted, are the fruites of their redemption, pledges to them of better things to come; and so to learne to reioyce in the vse of them, as testimonies of Gods loue and fauour in Christ.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Sixtly, it would do well in their ioy for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, to thinke how sodainly and soone they may be lost, and all turned quickly into the contrary. Also, to remember the afflictions of the Church, &amp; of some chiefe members therof, which mourne now when they reioyce; that by a fellow seeling of others miseries, their owne ioy may be layed, and brought into better compasse.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Seuenthly, let them further call to mind, how often they reade of Christs teares and sighings for sins &amp; miseries of others; how sildome or neuer they reade of his laughter and mirth. Which though (no doubt) he had, and did partake of it, being a man like to vs, in all things saue sin, (and to reioyce is in it selfe no sinne) yet likely it was sparingly; and surely no mention is made of it in the story of the Gospell. He was at some feasts indeede, but no word of his mirth there.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Lastly, our mirth as it would bee by all good meanes moderated, so there would care be taken, that it be referred to a good end, which hath a great stroke in the goodnesse of any action; namely, to take our worldly comforts with this purpose and mind, that we
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3215:92"/>
may be the more apt to praise God with cheerefulnesse of heart, and to goe through the laborious and irksome trauels of our calling with more alacrity and liueli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Thus there will not onely bee no harme in our worldly mirth whereof to repent, but it will proue an helpe to vs vnto godlinesse, and be as an hand-maide to that spirituall reioycing vnder the hope of glory.</p>
                     <p>Now to your other knot, how it falleth our, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing Christians, notwithstanding their hope and ioy in God, yet are sometime filled with despaire and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort; if I should say no more, but that they may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thanke the abuse of worldly ioy, as the cause of those heauy gnawings of despaire which come ouer their stomacks, I should say something, and which were too true: howbeit I will deliuer to you more fully what I iudge of the despaire of the beleeuers. And first, I iudge it a very strange worke of God, that it should fall<note place="margin">Grounds of hope.</note> out, that a true beleeuer should despaire, considering that the hope which is put into his heart, as an anchor sure and stedfast, hath such firme ground-worke as the constant truth, the omnipotent power, the vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mercies of God the Father; also the precious death, perfect obedience, powerful resurrection of Christ, our Mediatour: finally, the sanctification and graces of the holy Spirit, which as the first fruites of the Spirit, as the earnest of our inheritance, the beginnings of life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, the peculiar ornaments of Christs Spouse, serue to be as vnder helpes and props of hope, there being also the Ministry of the Word and Sacraments, and many other meanes to confirme hope; I say, that for all this, they should be sometime in that case, as if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard of God, of life euerlasting, or had not known
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:3215:93"/>
what hope had meant, it is very strange indeede. Yet all<note place="margin">Of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire of the faithfull.</note> experience both old and new telleth vs, that as in the Elect before their calling, there is a meere want and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of hope; so after their calling, diuers of them are subiect to despaire, wherein they professe a want of hope, (though in truth it be not lost) the operation and worke of it being only stopped, affirming of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that they cannot be saued; that God hath giuen them ouer for euer, and such like, which in some happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vpon a deniall of the Gospell, through feare, as in<note place="margin">The occasions</note> 
                        <hi>Francis Spira;</hi> in some others it comes from a weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of faith, meeting with some strong &amp; deepe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which so ouershadow Gods countenance, as the poore soules thinke the sunne of his fauour will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer arise and shine more in their firmament. In some it comes from too deepe a sight of their owne sinfulnesse<note place="margin">As in Dauid, hath God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to be mercifull?</note> and vnworthinesse, seuered from the consideration of Gods promised mercies, and finally in other some from the touch and conscience of a foule crime. It being the nature of sinne to be sweete in committing, and sowre in reckoning; hony in the mouth, and grauell in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: and the practise of Sathan hauing once allured to doe a sinne, by hiding the punishment, afterward to perswade to draw to despaire, by couering and keeping backe the promises of mercy.</p>
                     <p>The counsell of God in all this towards his children,<note place="margin">The ends of Gods counsell in it.</note> most wise and gracious, purposing by these examples of despaire, to let all men see, that there is no stay or strength in any man, and that the stoutest is but feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, if God leaue them; that all may learne to distrust and feare themselues, being kept from that dangerous sinne of presumption, the break-necke of the soule; and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:3215:93"/>
striue to depend wholly vpon the might and strength of God in all humility, with earnest and continuall prayer for his help and supportation, often beseeching, and most feruently praying; <hi>Lord leade vs not into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: O Lord forsake vs not ouer long; Psal. 119. 8.</hi> Also God vseth to make his owne to feele an hel here of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and despaire, that they may better iudge of the loue of Christ, in suffering the sorrowes of death for them, wrestling with his Fathers wrath, and haue their hearts moued the more to loue him. Further, the anguish and smart which they feele in their pangs of despaire, as it causeth them more to long for comfort before it come; so when it cometh, that the sense of Gods loue is resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and their hope of glory reuiued, it is as welcome and sweete, euen as faire weather after much foule, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty after bondage, and a calme after a great storme. For herein the despaire of the godly differeth from the despaire of the wicked, that whereas these being voide of true hope, therefore in their despaire they are wholy forsaken of God, and finally, or for euer. The faithfull on the other side doe despaire not wholly, but in part, the work of their hope being stopped, but the faculty or habite of hope not being quenched; neither finally, but for a time, they are left to despaire, being raised vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to a good and more firme hope, which afterward<note place="margin">The effects of Hope.</note> workethin them very strongly, to the bringing forth of many excellent effects in them, begetting in them a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and will to liue godly in the whole course of their liues; 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 5.

godly course, not fainting for any troubles, because they by hope look for a blessed recompence in the end; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Breeding also a contempt of the vanities and pompe of this World, as it is to be seene in <hi>Moses; He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi> 11. Engendering a contentment and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to die, vpon expectation of an happier life hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And finally, asswaging our greefe and sorrow for the death and departure of our Christian friends; as 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. verse last. Which effects, though alwayes they accompany Christian hope, yet most of all when it is reuiued and refreshed after a fit of despaire.</p>

                     <p>May it please you to beare with me, if I put you to dissolue another doubt, how the hope of the faithfull may be seuered from presumption of vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, which is so like it, as a simple one can hardly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them; and how it falleth out, that such as haue liuely hope, doe offend through presumption, seeing they are two things?</p>

                     <speaker>Apollos.</speaker>
                     <p>It is a thing well moued; for as in other things<note place="margin">Hope diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</note> likenesse is the Mother of errour, so here many a mans presumption is taken of him for hope, because of the likenesse: yet the truth is, that that which vnbeleeuers doe account their hope, is but their presumption. Whereas they imagine that their hope is grounded and setled on God his free mercies, and vndeceiuable truth, and the merits of Christ Iesus, they doe onely imagine this; their hope being in truth fixed vpon worldly things, as their wealth, friends, credit, and such like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities: and may appeare to be so sundry wayes. First,<note place="margin">Wicked men haue no hope in God.</note> by expresse testimonies of holy Scriptures, which eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently affirmeth their hope and trust not to be in the <hi>Liuing God,</hi> but <hi>in their Riches;</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. and that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3215:94"/>
                        <hi>riches is their strong Tower; Prou.</hi> 18. 11. And <hi>their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is their hope, and gold their confidence; Iob</hi> 31. And their trust is in <hi>the multitude of their riches; Psal.</hi> 52. 7. And therefore it is saide, <hi>Their portion is here; Psal.</hi> 17. 14. And that <hi>they haue their comfort in this world; Luk.</hi> 6. 24. And that their hope shall perish, and come to an end. Moreouer, there be diuers tokens in the wicked, which doe certainely declare it to be thus; as namely, that they cannot abide their worldly delights and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to be spoken against; therefore the Pharises mocked Christ, when hee reproued their couetousnesse, which proues their money to be their Idoll, and their belly their God. Secondly, in the presence and abundance of earthly goods, they haue heart and hope; but when these faile and are gone, they waxe heartlesse and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, as is to be seene in <hi>Nabal</hi> and <hi>Belshasser.</hi> Thirdly, their great labour taken, and their great cost bestowed about earthly matters, doth bewray where their heart is, which is further manifested by the speaking so much, and so willingly of their worldly commodities &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. Their language shewes what Countreymen they be, not of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which is from aboue, but of the earth here below. But their continuing in a sinful course of life, without all true remorse or returning, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate that they haue no other hope of saluation, but a naked presumption: for we haue shewed before, that true Christian hope as it strengtheneth the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of faith, so it stirreth vp the heart where it is, vnto repentance and practise of godlinesse; hope of glory will not suffer a man to wallow in the mire and puddle of his filthy and vncleane lusts. Therefore such as serue sinne in the lusts and desires thereof, casting from them
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:3215:95"/>
care of yeelding obedience to the knowne will of God, in that they will pretend to haue hope in Gods mercies and goodnesse, and in Christs death and passion; they doe but abuse the mercies of God, and the merits of Christ, which are offered and preached vnto men, to keepe them from sinning, and to call them to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, as it is written; <hi>There is mercy with God, that he may be feared; Psal.</hi> 142. 4. And that the <hi>kindnesse of God leadeth to repentance: Rom.</hi> 2. 4. For which purpose reade also <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 1. Now the hope of the godly it is so far off, that thereby they doe waxe bold to offend, because they hope in Gods grace for pardon, as contrariwise, they are much moued to all good care of pleasing God, in a new course of life, to the end. And as it is farre from them to grow secure in the carriage of their life, vpon the hope they haue of Gods fauour and his glory; so they doe not take heart to sinne, as the wicked doe, vpon opinion to repent at last: for they know and consider, that men may die sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly. And that as late repentance is suspitious not to be true, so it is iust with God to forsake them in their death, who haue forsaken his commandements in their life: as also the longer it is ere one repent, the harder it is, sinne by custome hauing gotten strength; as the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that one goeth out of his way, the longer it is ere he can returne. Howbeit, it is certain that Gods faithful Children are subiect vnto sinnes of presumption, else would not the holy Prophet haue prayed against them; <hi>Psalm</hi> 19. &amp; 119. Yea, and sundry times, what for the better humbling of them, what for the example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to teach all men to feare themselues, and to liue in awe continually of God, and for the more full manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:3215:95"/>
of this mercy toward the godly, in pardoning euen their presumptuous sinnes; for these and such like respects, they are left of God to themselues, to presume and be too confident (not in Gods goodnesse and truth, for that is the office of their hope) but vpon their owne strength and outward prosperity, forgetting the Lords goodnesse towards them, and their owne great frailty,<note place="margin">Hope ioyned with some presumption.</note> as may be seene in example of <hi>Dauid;</hi> Psalme 30. 6. <hi>In my prosperity I saide, I shall neuer be moued.</hi> And of <hi>Peter</hi> Mathew 26. <hi>I will neuer denie thee, I will die rather;</hi> whose presumption cost them much sorrow and many a salt teare: therefore let all men be warned by their harmes.

                     <p>The loue of God (that is, not the actiue loue wherewith we loue him) but the passiue loue where with we are beloued of him, which giueth both strength to our hope, and matter of our ioy, is then saide to be shed abroade in our hearts, when the sence and feeling of it is shed &amp; powred into the hearts of the faithfull, whom God loueth in his purpose and decree from before the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:3215:96"/>
World was made, and actually loued them at the time of their calling to faith in his Sonne; the manifestation whereof vnto them, when it is so expressed to them in the fruits of it, as their hearts be affected with a ioyous feeling of it: this is the shedding of it abroade, which is the eighth fruite of Iustification. It may be somewhat declared by this comparison of the boxe of precious ointment mentioned, <hi>Mathew</hi> 26. which while the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had it, kept shut, gaue no sauour; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing powred it out, and shed it on Christs head, it did yeeld a sweete and pleasant sent and smell to all which were in the house: Euen so the loue of God is shut and pent vp in Gods purpose (as it were) till it be felt of the Elect; but after they haue faith to beleeue the promise of saluation by Christ, vnto their fellowship with Christ himselfe, and all his benefits, then his loue (as an oyntment powred out) doth plentifully refresh their hearts with the comfortable sence and feeling of it, as the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38, 39. and the faithfull, to whom <hi>Peter</hi> wrote, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. had good experience. Wherein the wonderfull goodnesse of God doth vtter it selfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his chosen in this, that hee doth not onely loue them in purpose, but by speciall and singular fruites, as pawnes and pledges (and namely by giuing his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Sonne, to suffer such a reprochfull and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death for them, being sinners and his enemies) doth assure them so of his loue, as they know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue they are beloued, and are exceedingly cheered in their hearts, with a certaine perswasion of his loue; which verily is a great matter, and serues them to great good purposes. For as it is nothing to a blinde man to know there is a Sunne, a glorious and bright creature,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:3215:96"/>
when himselfe cannot enioy the sight of it; or to a very poore man, to know where much treasure is, while himselfe cannot come at it to haue any part of it: so it is nothing to heare and know that there is much loue hid in God, except our selues feele it, and become parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it; but when the sence of this infinite loue of God, is by a speciall worke of the Spirit giuen vnto the faithfull, loe then there ariseth ioy and gladnesse in the soule, euen <hi>vnspeakable and glorious ioy;</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 8. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, a great encrease of their hope, in a more full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of enioying the blessing hoped for: in as much as that God who hath so loued and so testified his loue, cannot change and deceiue vs. And there is moreouer by the sence of Gods loue toward vs, another loue in<note place="margin">1 Iohn 4. 19, 20.</note> vs kindled toward him, and toward all whom hee would haue vs loue, as shall hereafter more largely be shewed.</p>
                     <p>But now I hasten to the ninth and last fruite, which<note place="margin">9.

Which commeth herehence, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers finding Gods loue so farre forth declared to them for his Sonnes sake, as not onely to acquit them of all guilt and condemnation of sinne, by his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and death, whereby of enemies they were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God <note n="*" place="margin">Seeing the sinnes of the Elect could not hinder their reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation by the death of Christ, their sinnes done after reconciliation, cannot keepe them From hope of saluation, and in this regard also, they doe glory.</note>: But furthermore, to allow them his perfect obedience and holinesse, to be their owne by imputation, euen to the interessing of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the glorious inheritance of Heauen; they doe thereupon greatly glorie, and in a holy manner boast-and insult in their spirits ouer all the Enemies
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:3215:97"/>
of their saluation, that God is become so exceeding fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable vnto them, as being well and throughly resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that howsoeuer the force of <hi>Adams</hi> disobedience ioyned to their owne sinnes, was very great, for the spoiling of them of perfect integrity, and filling them full of the infection of sinne, to the casting them downe from an happy estate to infinite misery; yet the grace of Christ in the merit of his passiue and actiue righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to wit, of his sufferings and doings, is of far more exceeding might and vertue for the ouercomming of their sinnes, and the restoring of them to a farre more surpassing blessednesse then that they lost; grace super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abounding aboue sinne. So as their hearts be repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with ioy and glorying, not onely because of the glory they looke for in Heauen, but also in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and beleefe of that wonderous fauour which God the Father in his Sonne Christ, and for his sake, beareth to them here in their pilgrimage.</p>

                     <p>No, good friend, not so; I would haue sent you word of it, if there had beene any such matter; my late comming was occasioned by some vnlooked for affaires. It is not with men of my function, as it is with you, and men of your condition; who hauing lookt to your selues, and some few which depend on you, or haue to deale with you, there is an end of your care: but our care stretcheth further, and is publike, not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate onely.

Sathan will find vs worke enough; wee must be faine to wake, when others sleepe; and though I will not mention any party to you, yet the matter about which I haue been stayed from you, I will impart vnto you. It was of one that did acknowledge himselfe to beleeue truly &amp; vnfainedly in Christ for the remission of his sinnes, and yet doubted of his sanctification; he found his heart so encombred and toyled with the vile
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:3215:98"/>
corrupt motions of finne, which arise vp in him (as hee saide) euen like sparkes out of a burning Furnace, or as vapours out of a low, moist, and waterish ground.</p>

                     <p>See the notable malice and subtilty of that old Serpent, when hee cannot preuaile against Gods Children in the maine, to make them doubt of their faith, and whether they haue their sinnes forgiuen them; he troubles them about the bye, and wil stirre vp doubting about their sanctification, whether they be renewed. If hee cannot come directly to strike at the heart, yet he will haue a blow at the thigh, or the leg; so as hee may wound any where, it is enough to him: but with his malice he couples vnmatchable policy, for by breeding scruple about our renewing by the Spirit of sanctification, his purpose is to draw the temptation vnto this; That therefore they haue no faith, they are not forgiuen their sinnes, they are none of Gods Children.</p>

                     <p>Ye say right, and very truly touching Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans drift in this temptation: but herein Sathan de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth himselfe a sot, to seeke to perswade one that hath his faith whole and vncrackt, and doth beleeue himselfe iustified and pardoned, that hee is not sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. For whomsoeuer Christ iustifieth, them at the same time he doth sanctifie. These two workes in the<note place="margin">Iustification and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation both together.</note> soule of a Christian, can no more be diuided, then the two natures of God and man can be diuided in Christ: for that death of Christ which hath merited remission of sinnes to the beleeuer, the same hath merited the holy Ghost to be giuen him for the creating of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in his heart. And that faith which apprehends the merit of Christs death and obedience for iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:3215:98"/>
doth also lay hold vpon the vertue and power of his death and resurrection, for the renewing of the<note place="margin">Sanctification, it is by faith.</note> minde and will vnto Gods Image of holinesse and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse. Faith doth as well purifie the heart from fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, as deliuer it from guiltinesse of sinne; <hi>Acts</hi> 15. And God the Father which gaue his Sonne to be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, made him also to be sanctification to vs; not onely in that his holinesse imputed, couereth all our prophanenesse of nature and life: but for that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his most holy Nature powred into our corrupt nature, changeth both minde and will from darknesse of ignorance and sinne, to the light of knowledge and holinesse. Therefore Iustification and Sanctification<note place="margin">Iustification and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, be as two twinnes, which came together into the world of the beleeuing heart; Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation being the elder fister.</note> be ioyned in Scripture, as Chickens of one broode; 1 <hi>Cor. 6.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> when hee had named the <hi>Ephesians</hi> Saints by calling, and presently addeth, <hi>the faithfull in Christ Iesus;</hi> he would teach not onely who be worthy to be entitled Saints, but also how the Elect come by this grace, euen through faith in Christ Iesus; faith as an Instrument receiuing as well the Spirit of Christ vnto sanctification or making vs Saints, as his righteousnesse vnto iustification, that wee may stand iust. And thus faith of the truth, and sanctification of the Spirit, are put both together; 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. because they cannot be seuered: but it is of necessity, that he that beleeueth the truth of the promise for forgiuenesse of sin, hath a power from the Spirit, applying the vertue of Christ dead and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for the destruction of sinne, that he may walke ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily <note n="*" place="margin">Therefore Sathans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is thus to be retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: I beleeue, therefore I am sanctified: I haue my sinnes forgiuen, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</note> And now we are thus put vpon this argument of sanctification, if it please you wee will consider of it more distinctly and throughly. Let me heare of you by what names this gift vseth to be called in Scripture, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:3215:99"/>
amongst Diuines; and then how ye doe describe sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, what be the causes and parts of this benefit, in what measure we hold it; how it is to be discerned in a mans selfe, by what markes, and such other things as doe concerne this doctrine.</p>

                     <p>As vnion with Christ, incorporation into him, &amp; engrafting or coniunction or communion with Christ, doe all import one thing, or being one with Christ; and as iustification, and imputation of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, remission of sinnes, be often vsed to signifie one thing, the absolution of a sinner before the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of God: so there be certaine words, as regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, renewing, or renouation, and sanctification, which import one selfe-same action and worke of the Spirit, euen that whereby the corruption of sinne (as touching the dominion and the power which it doth exercise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our calling) is destroyed, till it selfe at length bee wholy abolished; and in stead thereof a new quality of holinesse put into the faculties of the soule, that it may begin to loue, and doe such things as are pleasing vnto God, till it come at last to perfection, by certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. This worke or action of the Spirit, it is called, renouation, or renewing, because of that new grace and<note place="margin">Renewing.</note> quality powred into the mind and will; the former cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which is called the olde man, being killed. As in the first worke of creation, hee that was nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was made a man: so in this worke of renouation, or new creation, hee that was naught before, is made good; as if a new man were borne. Hence also it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Regeneration, or new birth indcede, not properly<note place="margin">Regeneration.</note> nor fitly; for our regeneration is the same with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation or vnion with Christ; wherby we become
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3215:99"/>
his members, euen one body with him. For as by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration we haue our being in this World, and take the essence or nature of our Parents, to become their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; so by regeneration wee haue our being of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, to become the members of Christ, sonnes of God; being before children of wrath, and members of Sathans kingdome, sonnes of <hi>Adam.</hi> Thus doth our Sauiour himselfe teach vs to vnderstand it: for hauing saide, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12. That such <hi>as beleeue in Christ, are the sonnes of God:</hi> he presently addeth; <hi>Which are borne not of bloud, &amp;c. but of God.</hi> To declare this vnto vs, that our new birth or regeneration, is the making of vs the sonnes of God by faith, and not the furnishing vs with such qualities and properties, as belong to such as bee already sons. Howbeit, for as much as most Diuines and best learned men, doe confound regeneration and sanctification, I doe therefore follow that commonly receiued iudgement, and by regeneration vnderstand, that framing of the heart to Gods Image, in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and true holinesse; which because it is an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate consequent of our new birth, (wherein wee are begotten to be sonnes and daughters of God) and as<note place="margin">Sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> it were the putting of another and new nature into vs, euen that diuine (as <hi>Peter</hi> calleth it) therefore is vsually<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 5.</note> called by the name of new birth. Now for the last word of sanctification, whereas that word is somtimes generally vsed in Scripture, to signifie all that, euen whatsoeuer it is that we haue from, or is done in vs by Christ, and is as much as our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:3215:100"/>
it is that speciall worke of the Spirit, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs in the spirit of our mind vnto a new man, which after God is created in righteousnesse and holinesse of truth; as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, <hi>Ephesians</hi> 4. 23, 24. Or more briefly, it is that worke of God, whereby our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption by little and little is abolished, and holinesse perfected by degrees. For in this worke, though Christ minister a power to the beleeuer by his Spirit, against sinne, to master it, and to doe the will of God; yet it is not absolute at the first, so as by it all sinne should be vtterly done away, not at all to be in the soule; and a strength giuen perfectly to worke good: for then the Law might be fulfilled of vs in this life, and then wee should iustifie our selues, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But whereas in sinne, beside the guilt and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation wherein we are wrapt, and from which our Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification hath freed vs, and in stead thereof hath put vpon vs righteousnesse vnto life; there is also in it a tyranny, dominion and power, which by the iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God it exerciseth, euen ouer the very Elect, who are the seruants of sinne, and doe willingly offer the faculties of their soules, and parts or members of their body, as weapons and instruments to fight and warre <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Now in this worke of our Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, there is strength &amp; force giuen to the beleeuing soule, against this tyranny of sinne, to beate it downe and subdue it, to keepe it as vnderling; that howsoeuer it dwell and remaines there, egging to euill, and still so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting and prouoking against God, yet it wants now

much of his former vigour and might, so as it cannot reigne and rage with full swinge, as it was wont to carry vs headlong after all vngodlinesse &amp; vnrighteousnesse; this we get by our Sanctification.</p>

Diuines vse to make two parts, and that according to Scripture The first is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or crucifying of the old man, which hath two degrees; First, the death of sinne: Secondly, the buriall of sinne, which is the progresse of the death of sinne. In respect hereof, the faithfull are saide to be <hi>crucified with Christ,</hi> and their body of sinne to be <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with him; Rom.</hi> 6. 6. And also, to be <hi>dead to sinne,</hi> to be <hi>baptized into his death,</hi> to be <hi>dead with him,</hi> &amp; to be <hi>buried with him; Rom.</hi> 6. 2, 3, 8. The second part of our Sanctification, is our walking in new nesse of life, or <hi>quickening the new man, or liuing to God; Rom.</hi> 6. 4. In which respect wee are said to be <hi>raysed vp together with Christ, and to liue with him; Phil.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 8. Here then we haue with the parts of Sanctification, the true cause thereof deliuered to vs; which I will for better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding<note place="margin">Cause of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</note> thus declare, and set forth according as I conceiue of it.</p>
                     <p>The first part of Sanctification, is the death of sinne, or dying to sinne; which is, when that the strength of our sinnefull corrupt Nature is taken
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:3215:101"/>
downe, and by degrees weakened, as the body of Christ languished by degrees vpon the Crosse; so as sinne cannot bring forth such euill fruites in thoughts, words, and deedes, as it did while wee were vnder the power of it. This is effected by force of Christs death applied vnto vs: for that same diuine power of Christ which sustained his manhood in the suffering of death, and gaue it merit to deserue for vs remission of sinnes, the same godhead and diuine power worketh in the members of Christ thereby the death and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sinne, that it should be lessened in force, as well as it wipeth away the guilt of their sinnes. Hence it is saide, <hi>Our sinne is dead by his body;</hi> and againe, <hi>Our</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>old man is crucified with him;</hi> because the body of Christ<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 6.</note> crucified, did deserue for vs, that his diuine power should kill and crucifie sinne in them which beleeue in his death. The second part of Sanctification, is the buriall of sinne, which is the continuall proceeding of mortification, euen as buriall is the proceeding of death; sinne wasting in the Elect, touching his vigour and strength, euen as corpes waste and moulder in the graue: this is wrought by Christ buried, whiles that diuine might which preserued the body of Christ in the graue without putrifaction, doth effect in the members of Christ, by meanes of his buried body, a greater degree of mortification, euen to the burying and casting mould (as it were) on their sinnes; then they are saide to be buried with him.</p>
                     <p>The third part of Sanctification, is the quickening of the new man, which consists of two parts, to wit, holinesse, containing all vertues and duties, whereby we are fitted for the loue and worship of God. 2 Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3215:101"/>
which hath all such vertues and duties as enable to loue, and profit our neighbour in all things which concerne him. This proceedeth from Christ raised againe from the dead; that same diuine vertue which wrought in Christs body, for the quickening and raising it being dead, working also in the soules of his members, in whom sinne is already wounded by his death and buriall, for their raising vp and quickening vnto godlinesse; that they may liue to God, hauing strength to practise and doe the workes of God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did the workes of sinne. For the Elect being coupled to Christ by faith, and being one with his manhood touching the substance of it, yet spiritually, are also one with the godhead touching the efficacy thereof: whence it is, that the godhead which vttered force and might in Christ, to vphold him in his death, preseruing him from corruption in his graue, and to raise him againe the third day; the same godhead pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully effecteth in Christs members the mortification of sinne by his death and buriall, and newnesse of life by his resurrection. As the graft which is set in a new stocke, taketh iuyce and life from that stock into which it is newly planted: so the faithfull partake of the vertue and power of Christ, dead and raised, with whom they haue communion, being grafted into him by his Spirit through faith. But this power of Christ communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the beleeuers, to the killing of sinne, and to the quickening of them to God, and all godlinesse; it doth not effect this worke all at one time, but after a long time bringeth it to perfection. They therefore are in a dangerous errour, such as tendeth to the making of such swel as do beleeue it for truth, and others to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

Besides the falsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of it, all Scriptures, both examples and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, crying the contrary; and euery mans owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and experience proclaiming aloude, that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ceasse to sinne, till wee ceasse to liue; and that the breath of sinne and our breath, be both at once stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. In so plaine and vndoubted a matter, proofe is needlesse, yet the forme of prayer by Christ appointed to all Christians to be vsed of them as a prayer and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of all prayers to be made by them in their pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, enioyning them to aske forgiuenesse of sinnes past, to craue deliuerance from temptations of Sathan and sinne for the time to come; and the Sacrament of the Supper, which belongeth not to men which want nothing, but to such as hauing many and great wants, do in the sence of them hunger after Christ and his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and finally, the chastisements of God, common to all his children, which are corrected of God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent future faults and offences; especially that iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death, which taketh hold of all, doe demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to euery one that is not wilfully blind, that there is none of all the Saints which here in this World doe, or can liue without sinne. Therefore it will be good to spare this labour, and in stead of prouing this (which were as if one would bring a candle to giue light to the Sunne) to declare rather the ends of Gods counsell

therein: and withall, seeing sanctified persons haue still sinne stirring and striuing in them, and bringing forth most loathsome fruites; how they may perceiue that they haue the grace of Sanctification.</p>

                     <p>Friend <hi>Aquila,</hi> I doe well allow of your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; for I am of this minde, that for many proofes in matters not darke, nor doubtfull, nor of great profit, it is but waste time; and rather bewrayes the vanity of the speaker, (his indiscretion at least) then any whit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes the hearer: may it please you then to goe to those points which you haue propounded? and sithence it is so, that it had beene as easie for God in the regenerating of his Elect, to haue freede them vtterly of sinne, and put into them absolute holinesse, as he did at first create man righteous, voide of all corruption; and this had beene much better for vs, as one would thinke, at once to be rid of such an enemy, and had also more expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Gods power to haue quelled it at one blow, rather then by many strokes: what might therefore be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why it is otherwise, that his children after sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, not onely haue sin still abiding, but more<note n="*" place="margin">Before their sanctification, the Elect and finne do agree as husband &amp; wife; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they are at variance as two enemies.</note> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome to them then before?</p>

                     <p>That it hath pleased God to haue it thus, the matter it selfe speaketh; and being he is most wise, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will haue it so for most iust causes. For touching his power, there is no doubt but thereby he could haue caused it to be otherwise: for how could not he quit the soule and body from sinne in the time of life, that can doe it at death in one instant? and his goodnesse is such, that had it been more expedient for his children to haue had it so, it had surely beene so. But the truth is, Gods way, as in all other things, so in this, is the best way.

For as it was Gods wonderful mercy at all to giue them sanctification in any measure, and so to put them out of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

First, in that sinne is suffered still to remaine, and to tempt them, it stirreth vp watchfulnesse to haue such an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my<note place="margin">1. Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> within the house, yea in the bed-chamber, euen in the inward heart and spirit of a man; it will not suffer him to sleepe in security. But as in Townes which are only assaulted outwardly, men stand continually vpon the guard: so it behoueth much more Gods Children to doe, hauing their City already surprized, sinne being within their soule. This is it also which will cause them with awefull watch to ioyne faithfull &amp; ardent prayer, for helpe and strength from God against it. Whence it is, that our Sauiour hauing put his Disciples in minde of their sinfull weakenesse, <hi>The flesh,</hi> saith he, <hi>is weake;</hi> that is, sinne and corruption maketh you weake, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist euill, or to doe good: therefore hee commandeth them, and in them all other Christians to giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to watchfulnesse and prayer, lest they fall into<note place="margin">2.

For Sathan finding vs feeble and ready to stumble and fail at euery straw through sinne, will be apt enough to take the aduantage of our infirmity, and by his subtill temptations to draw vs to wickednesse; so as there will be danger of being conquered by him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with a watchfull eye Christians looke to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and get them for succour vnto God, that by

his might they may bee made able for to stand. Therefore as the Canaanites which were left in the Land vndestroyed, did both awe the Israelites, awake their slothfulnesse, and prouoke them in danger to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Yea, they are<note place="margin">To Enemies.</note> by this meanes not without some griefe, to heare of the grosse and horrible wickednesse of Gods enemies, remembring that the same inclinations to euils, and seedes of sinne are in themselues, which so breake out to the shame and ruine of others.

For when their sinnes &amp; temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations force them to God, and his mercy aud truth doe manifest themselues, being found when hee is

That were it not for Gods mercifull acceptance passing by, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3215:104"/>
winking at the euill, pardoning wants and staines, and imputing his Sonnes righteousnesse to the Saints, their holiest endeauours might worthily sinke them into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.

                     <p>And also in these, and sundry other respects; as to stirre vp in the godly a desire and loue to the fellowship of the Saints, to the vse of the Lords Supper, and all other good meanes of their saluation: to the patient bearing with, and gently censuring the imperfections of their brethen, and infinite such other benefits as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to themselues, by this way of their imperfect sanctification, God doth maruellously worke out his owne glory.

Finally (which is an admirable<note place="margin">8.

Besides, it turnes greatly to Satans great confusion, their fales prouing medicines and remedies, and preuentions of future sinnes; and this as it much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth to Gods honour, so it cannot choose but vex Sathan at the heart, that such sinnes as he hath drawne<note place="margin">9.

                     <p>I doe well allow of your purpose; onely by the way let me put you in remembrance, that by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of sinne in the new borne Christians, and by those daily bitter fruits which spring from thence, there

is more occasion giuen to the godly to exercise their faith, touching the forgiuenesse promised, and their hope touching the blessednesse to come, and all other their graces: which if they were perfect, and all sinne done away at their regeneration, then what great vse of faith or hope, when there should bee no vnbeleefe or doubting within them? or what vse of any other vertue, when it lacked the opposition &amp; resistance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vice, to set it on worke? Here is our warfare, and there must be a continuall strife inwardly in our selues betweene grace and sinne, as well as out wardly against the wicked.

There being no lesse grace, if not more, expressed in forgiuing sinnes done after the Spirit of God and faith receiued, then such as were done before.

First, a sanctified man hath care to order his life, his whole way and euery step of it by the knowledge of the Word, of which he enquireth what hee may doe, and what not; still taking counsell from thence, doing all his things as necre as hee can, by that diuine direction, and with application of Christ; belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that his weaknesses are in him hidden, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse of his worke wiped and purged by his death: whereas the ciuill man dependeth vpon the allowance and reputation of men, which if hee obtaine, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents him, he lookes no further, but to haue a good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation in the World. And whereas the sanctified man aymeth at this most, how to please God, euen with the deniall and displeasure of his owne corrupt heart: the ciuill man doth not take thought, nor trouble his head about the pleasing of God, in the good he doth, nor in leauing euils for the offence of God; but seeketh and studieth to please himselfe, and such whose fauour hee desireth to liue in, ordering his course to his owne and their liking.</p>

                     <p>Good friend <hi>Aquila,</hi> I perceiue that olde enemy of yours, and of all good men, hath not done with you; nor indeede will he, till either you be dead, or he cast and chained vp in hell. I am not so sorrie for your greefefull combate, as I am glad of your ioyfull victory ouer it. But thus it falleth out, that as after a great calme sodainly ariseth a rough storme, and then returnes a calme againe; so our ioyes, euen when they are of the best sort, are broken off with some greeuous euents inward or outward, after which commeth mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of gladnesse againe.

When all is well at home, that I get the mastery of my sinfull affections, I

                     <p>The last time of our conference, you did truly affirme, that the worke of Sanctification is vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect during this life, and that the diuine power of Christ by his death hath crackt, but not wholy crusht the strength of the olde man; which by mortification is left as a Souldier that hath his braine pan crackt with a blow, who yet liueth, and strugleth still with his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary; or as a serpent that hath his head brused, but wrig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles still with his tayle: and yet by his rising vp, the heart is quickened and made a new man, yet left as a weake babe or young childe, who is in processe of time to gather strength, and to grow vp to the age and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a man, till hee come to a ripe age.

And though he can neuer hope to heale his wound againe, and to set him in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer plight, yet hee is content to conspire with remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning corruption, and to vse it as an instrument to vexe and hurt the Children of God, whom hee doth so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely hate: yea, though he oftentimes be not afraide onely, but assured to take the foyley yet that accursed fiend (such is his malice) will be doing, and giuing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes and onsets.

                     <p>Indeed Sir, my owne experience being hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen with that which you taught vs, when you handled this point, amongst other the workes of grace, doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me to say somewhat of this argument, and to fetch it from the beginning. I doe well remember, that you haue shewed both by Scripture, and common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, especially that of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. 16, 17. vnto the end of the Chapter, a battell there is in euery good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian; and that it is spirituall and inuisible, fought by inuisible combaters and weapons. At length you deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the necessity of this battle, by the true causes of<note place="margin">Causes of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual combat.</note> it; whereof the first is the wil and good pleasure of God, who as he ordained his owne Sonne, so all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to this spirituall warre and conflict, thorow which they are to passe vnto the Crowne and the Kingdome, which is prepared for them; as in earth no man is crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, except first hee striue lawfully; none diuide the spoile, which first haue not abid the brunt of the battle, and obtained the victory. The second cause is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme malice of Sathan against Christ, the head; and for his sake, against all the Elect his members, whom he will neuer ceasse to tempt, and that with most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull subtilty, as a Serpent long experimented; and with outragious cruelty, as a red, fierce, and fell Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, or roaring Lyon, if it were possible to draw backe againe the regenerate vnto his kingdome, and hauing ouercome them, to destroy them; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. The third is the repugnancy and contrariety which is betweene
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:3215:109"/>
the Spirit and the flesh, in the new borne Christians, in whom they continually striue together, as the twinnes did in <hi>Rebeccaes</hi> wombe; the Spirit striuing against the flesh, and the flesh lusting against the Spirit, without truce or reconcilement: hell and Heauen, light and darkenesse, God and Sathan, being no more contrary in quality, then the Spirit and the flesh. Here I call to minde, that it was taught, that in Scripture phrase, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, grace, new man, law of the mind, in this argument were <hi>Synonyma,</hi> and of one signification: also flesh, old man, corruption, law of the members, were equiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent termes, importing one thing; so as euery regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man hauing these in him, consisted of a double man, and had two men warring in him perpetually, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his whole pilgrimage: the old man, which is that remainder of sinne, that vicious quality deprauing and poysoning our Nature, inclining to the breach of Gods Law, which is vsually called, <hi>the flesh.</hi> That which is <hi>borne of flesh, is flesh; Iohn</hi> 3. 6. And <hi>abstaine from the lusts of the flesh;</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 12. And <hi>corruption,</hi> as <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 22. The <hi>old man is corrupt,</hi> for it causeth spirituall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soundnesse, wasting all where it reigneth: lastly, <hi>Law of the members,</hi> because in faculties and powers of soule and body, it hath force of a king, or law to command and enioyne absolutely in wicked men; but in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, with resistance. And the other man, is the new man, which is that quality of holinesse created in mind and will, renewed by the Spirit of God; hence called <hi>The Spirit</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> because it is freely giuen and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth things gracious and pleasing to God: and lastly, <hi>The Law of the minde,</hi> because there it gouernes as a Law or Commander. Now the opposition and strife
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:3215:110"/>
betweene these two men in the regenerate, it is this in generall; that grace, or the Spirit, or the new man, doth raise and beget godly desires and affections tending to Heauen; and hindereth the wicked motions of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the old man: and this againe engendereth vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious euill desires and thoughts, crossing and hindering the good counsels and purposes of the Spirit and new man. In which conflict, sometime sinne preuaileth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst grace, carrying vs away, and leading vs captiue as it were, fast bound in fetters and chaines; <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. and sometime grace mastereth the lusts of sinne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth Conquerour. And this alwayes falleth out, by reason of this combate, that a godly person as he cannot doe what euill Sathan, sinne, and himselfe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will corrupt would doe; because grace dwelling in him, doth put an obstacle and barre vnto sinfull desires, that they doe not breake out as blisters or botches in ones body: so he is not able to attaine to performe either all that good which he would, or in so good a manner as he would, with such loue to God and his Neighbour, as his soule wisheth, and the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth; because remaining corruption doth oppose it selfe vnto the worke and motions of the Spirit. Which is the thing whereof <hi>Paul</hi> had experience in his owne person, and hath reported in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14, 15. both to the instruction of all, and great comfort of the weake: that by reason of dwelling sinne, egging and tempting him to euill, pulling and drawing him from God, hee both did the euils which he would not, and left vndone the good which hee would doe, or did it vntowardly and weakely. He could no sooner haue a good thought and motion tending to God ward, but euill was present and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3215:110"/>
at hand, very ready to quench and smother. This was the condition which hee was subiect vnto; euen like the condition of a sicke man newly recouered, or but recouering, who faine would walke a mile or two for his health: but when he begins to go, his legges dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnder him for feeblenesse, and he can scarse walke two turnes about his chamber. Or as it fareth with an escaped prisoner, which desireth to flye, and his heart could serue him to go twenty miles or forty a day; yet his bolts and fetters so comber him, as he can scarse rid one mile a day. So the Apostle felt, and so much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regenerated persons feele themselues encombred with their sinnefull Nature, as they are enforced euen when they do best, to do their duties with care, wants, and imperfections.</p>

                     <p>In this spirituall combate, there is a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall thing to bee enquired into: whether corruption do so farre at any time preuaile ouer grace, as wholly to extinguish it for a time; or the faithfull do but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall into a spirituall sleepe, deepely forgetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, yet still retaining the life of Grace. The case of <hi>Dauid</hi> falling so heinously, sinning so deliberately, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so long being falne, causeth diuers more then to suspect, that the godly in their conflict with sin, may take such a foyle, as to haue grace wholly beaten out of their hearts for a season, though not finally. For it thoughts, that he yeelded vnto sinne with his whole will, which cannot be, where any sparkle of Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines.</p>

                     <p>Sir, this is a Question, which it were more meete for you to make answer to then my selfe: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, seeing you will haue it so, I will speake my minde
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:3215:111"/>
in it. When I reade in Scripture, that God is vnchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable, his couenant euerlasting, his calling and giftes without repentance, his regenerating grace to bee an immortall seede, to remaine in the elect, to be such as none can take from them; and that the life of grace can no more returne to the death, then Christ can returne<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 9, 10, 11.</note> to dye againe; and that Christ doth make intercession for beleeuers, and that the Comforter which is giuen them, shall abide in them for euer: Vpon these, and such like grounds, I am resolued, that howsoeuer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing grace in the Elect may be wounded, yet not kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; battered and beaten, yet not raced; sore shaken, yet not plucked vp by the rootes. For God, who put it into their heart, still preseruing it, and being stronger then all that be against it, how can it vtterly faile? This is it therfore which I iudge, that when regenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, being ouercome by the strength of any tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in-bred corruption, yeeld vnto any sinne, their whole will doth neuer sinne so much onely doth sin, as is vnregenerate, the regenerate part doth neuer sin, neither can it sinne: for it is impossible that grace shold sinne, which is as contrary vnto sinne, as light is vnto darkenesse. The Spirit and grace, doth euer like and loue that which is good, and hate that which is euill. So the Apostle confesseth, that when hee did the euill he would not, and did not the good he would, it was dwelling sinne that did it, that is to say, his soule vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed was that which sinned; it was not he, that is, his soule so farre as it was vnrenewed, that did sinne: For his minde renewed serued the law of God, it was his flesh that serued the law of sinne: his inward man did euen then delight in the law of God, when the lawe of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:3215:111"/>
his members rebelled against it. And this is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all other the children of God: amongst whom, when any of them be ouercome in this conflict, their will and minde renewed doeth still make resistance to sinne; yet so feeble, so faintly, and weakely somtimes, that sinne gets the vpper hand, and grace is put to the worst.</p>
                     <p>Now touching <hi>Dauid,</hi> and such as do sinne in such a sort as he sinned, this is it which I do iudge of them; that it fareth with them as with a man going downe a steepe hill, whose foote once slipping, hee cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer himselfe, but tumbles downe till hee meete with some stay. Or, as it doth with one in a swoone or in a Lethargie, whose life is in them, and yet to seeming they are dead. Or, as a withered tree in winter season, which hath neither leafe, blossome, or beauty, and yet there is life in the roote. Or, as with a soldier, whose braine-pan being cracked with a blow, he lieth astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and as one vanquished; yet comming to himselfe againe, renewes the battle, and conquers his enemie. Or finally, as one taken prisoner against his will, for lacke of power to withstand the assault, being willing and ready to make an escape, whensoeuer an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is offered. As appeareth in the example of that Kingly Prophet, who was so held captiue in the hands of sinne, as when God did reach out a hand vnto him, to draw him out by the admonition of his Prophet outwardly, and the motion of his Spirit inwardly, hee quickly apprehended it; and embracing the occasion, gaue satan and sinne the slip, and (as wee say) shewed them a paire of faire heeles.</p>

But it remaines now, that ye speake something more particularly of this combate, and what weapons are to be vsed therein, &amp; after what sort we are to make vse of them?</p>

                     <p>Sir, it were a matter of great labour, a very long worke, particularly to rehearse how our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is assaulted by ignorance, our faith by infidelity, our loue by enuy and hatred, our holines by prophane lusts; our chastity and temperancy, by incontinency &amp; riot: also, to declare the dangerous stratagems, wiles, and enticements that are vsed by satan and the world, to vndermine and ouerthrow the poore christian soul. and this haply is sufficiently performed by som others. Touching the Weapons which wee are to vse in this warfare, and how by prayer wee are to get the power to vse them well, the Apostle instructeth vs fully, in the 6. chapter to the Ephesians. And for the right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the maine weapon, to wit, the Worde of God, we haue Christs practise in the 4. chap. of Matth. Therefore if it please you, leauing this argument, wee will passe forward to the doctrine of Repentance. This onely I thinke meete to say ere we part from this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that there is a very great oddes between a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate person, and one vnregenerate, as touching this fight against sinne: they both fight, but neyther vvith like minde, nor with like successe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="205" facs="tcp:3215:112"/>In vnregenerate persons, the light of naturall reason, and of knowledge infused into the conscience, doe checke sinne, as well as discouer it, leading the comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a mislike, and some kind of resistance, whereof the issue and successe is the holding backe of the rage of sinne, without weakning or killing it at the roote; in so much as when this resistance (such as it is) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, then sinne like a Gyant or a Tyrant mightily assaulteth, and insulteth ouer the poore soule, trampling it downe, and fiercely oppressing it. Whereas regenerate persons doe more then mislike sinne, and make some slender oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the keeping in of the fury of euill lusts; for they doe truly detest and hate sinne, as that which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the will, image, and glory of their Father, and the cause of curse to their blessed Redeemer: so as there is in them a conflict, not alone betweene reason and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and betweene conscience and sinne; but between grace and sinne, betweene the heart renewed by grace, and remaining sinne, which with a loathing is refused of them, when it ariseth and tempteth; the regenerate setting and bending themselues directly against euery lust of reason and will, as against a most mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which it desireth and seeketh vtterly to destroy: for that end being in continuall watch, frequent in seruent prayer, alwayes fearing infirmity, and Gods dreadfull Maiesty; the euent and successe of which strife is a daily wasting of sinne, and mortifying it at the roote, that it may at the length be quite abolished.</p>

In the worke of Sanctification, the holy Spirit doth as it were shape a new garment for the soule; which as it hath a robe without, to wit, the perfect iustice of Christ to put on by faith; so it hath other garments of lesse

Sanctification is as the building of an House, our soules and bodies thereby are made the <hi>Temples and habitation of God; Ephe.</hi> 2. verse last. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. Houses being wind and weather-beaten, will take decayes, and neede reparations. Now repentance is the repairing of those wrackes and harmes, which our selues take by the assaults of sinne and Sathan.

But tell me Sir, what Repeutance doe you meane? For Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance euen in Scripture phrase, is attributed sometime
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:3215:114"/>
to reprobates and wicked men, as where it is said, that <hi>Iudas repented him; Math.</hi> 27. 1. 2. And there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine repentance euen in <hi>Cain, Esau, Achab, Symon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and others, as the Story of Scriptures euidenceth. Beside, the Elect which yet are in their sinnes, and want all true sauing grace, the holy Ghost vseth to exhort them to repentance, as <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19. To those that killed Iesus, <hi>Peter</hi> saith; <hi>Repent, and returne.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 30. to the supersticious Athenians <hi>Paul</hi> saith; <hi>God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monisheth all men euery where to repent.</hi> See also <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 15. by which it may appeare that there is a repentance in some which are neuer sanctified; and others haue a repentance before their sanctification.</p>

                     <speaker>Apollos.</speaker>
                     <p>This was well moued: for it is true that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance hath sundry acceptions in the Word of God, which is the cause that Diuines write diuersly of this point, and somewhat confusedly sometime, for not du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distinguishing those workes of God, which he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly worketh in men as hee pleaseth. To shew you what I comprehend of this matter, this word Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is in Scripture either taken in euil part, or in good<note place="margin">Repentance hath sundry acceptions, &amp; what they be,</note> part; when it is taken in the euill part, then it signifieth a greefe of minde, conceiued onely for punishment of sinne, when yet the sinne it selfe is not a whit loathed and hated, but still well liked of. Thus is <hi>Iudas</hi> saide to repent, who because of the present horrour which his sinne bred in his conscience, and through the feare of future iudgement, wished that vndone, which hee had done, and so repented: but his heart nothing changed to abhorre his couetousnesse. When it is taken in good part, then it is either Legall or Euangelicall. Legall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance I call that, when by the ministery of the Law,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:3215:114"/>
the Spirit is effectuall to worke a sight of sinnes, both se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and grosse, and of the curse and punishment due thereunto, together with a certaine greefe and feare, in regard of that sinfull and wofull estate which the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner seeth by the Law himselfe to lie in. This in the Elect is a preparatiue to the grace of conuersion, and alwayes goeth afore; which though in it selfe it be not true sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing grace, yet it is the beginning, the entrance, and way to it, in all the chosen; and this is meant in part in all those exhortations made to vnconuerted elect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Repentance Euangelicall, is either generall or speciall; generall repentance which is a turning from all sinne at once, is that whereby a sinner being by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and threats of the Law stricken with terror, and humbled vpon sight and some sense of his owne dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable state through sinne, is by grace conuerted and changed in his minde and will, so as of an euill man hee become a good, now truly hating all his sinnes, as offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a good God reconciled in his Son, (and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for punishment sake,) and louing righteousnesse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feinedly. This is called passiue Repentance, or conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and is in truth the same with Sanctification, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ye may reade in these Texts, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 18. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 21. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. Speciall Repentance Euangelicall, it is that whereby a sinner that beleeueth forgiuenesse of his sinnes, and is sanctified or conuerted, and already made good, doth repent particularly of such sinnes, which by occasion in the course of his life he falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; this is of Diuines called particular Repentance, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and renewed Repentance, and they doe distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it from the former. And thus it is taken in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scriptures, where the Saints are saide to repent,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:3215:115"/>
or exhorted to repent; as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2. 5. and 3. 19. <hi>Mathew</hi> 18. 3. And thus in this sence doe I speake of it at this time, taking it for the repairing or renewing of those daily decayes and slips which doe arise in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of godlinesse. For as in a garment, namely a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers garment, there is alwayes something to be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and in an house, though well swept and cleansed, yet there will still be something to be purged out; and in an healthy body there fal out infirmiries to be cured: so in the life and conuersation of euery good Christian there will be still something to be repented of and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. Our frailety and Sathans malice being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, there would indeede that care and watchfulnesse be vsed, that as neere as euer may be, those pure gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our righteousnesse &amp; holinesse be kept cleane and vndefiled, and our Temples of body and soule to be preserued holy; yet as a materiall garment, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so well lookt vnto, gathereth spots, and the house which is kept most neatly and curiously, will haue dust and sulledgy: so in the best Christians somewhat will be alwayes amisle, and therefore the whole life of a Christian must be a continuall repentance. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some sinnes not yet espied, therefore not particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repented of; some espied, and yet not sufficiently ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, striuen against, and mastered: and some good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties not yet knowne to vs, and such as are knowne, not so zealously followed, nor so wisely, as becommeth the redeemed by Christ, which looke for eternall glory.</p>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:3215:115"/>
touching this particular euangelical Repentance, which is euery day to be renewed, euen as a good House-wife doth once a day sweepe her House, or as one that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a Letter, lookes often ouer it; so our life is often to be lookt ouer, that the errors thereof may be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: but where must this Repentance haue his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, wherein doth it consist, what be the kinds of it, by what tokens is it knowne and bewrayed? And after these things opened, I haue certain doubts and scruples to propound to you about the doctrine and practise of Repentance.</p>

                     <p>This renewed Repentance of the godly,<note place="margin">Godly sorrow beginning of renewed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> takes the beginning from a godly sorrow, engendred in the heart by the holy Ghost, vpon the discouery of our daily infirmities and falles, as the Apostle teacheth vs, 2 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 7. 10. <hi>Godly sorrow bringeth forth repentance,</hi> whereas <hi>worldly sorrow brings forth death.</hi> There is to be seene in the wicked, shadowish and counterfeit Repentance, the ground whereof is wordly sorrow, not a griefe stirred vp in the heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of displeasing God by some sinne, but in respect of worldly cause, as temporal losse, worldly shame and punishment; or else for feare, or through feeling of Gods wrath for sinne, which is a griefe may be found in a meere naturall and worldly man; the end of which griefe is death, occasioned by a despaire which is in them of obtaining mercy, by which they are brought to eternall, yea, and sometime to a temporall vntimely death; as is to be seene in <hi>Achitophel</hi> and <hi>Iudas.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are to be warned to abandon and put farre from their hearts this worldly sorrow, which not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can profit nothing, but thereby no man can either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:3215:116"/>
his losse or shame, or remoue his feared punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but bringeth forth a dangerous and deadly fruit, and to labour to conuert it into a godly sorrow, to greeue according to God; for this hath great commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it: for as it pleaseth God, being engendred by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the heart, which mourneth euen here hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the most mercifull God is offended by transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Law; therefore worthily called, godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: so it hath a notable blessed Issue, for it leadeth to repentance, and that to life or saluation. For as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but such as haue their heart smitten with heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, because of the displeasure of their louing God by their sinne, but they will meditate a turning from it, and an amendment; so they who enter into this course of Repentance, and so continue, it will at last leade them to saluation; and in the meane time it is a good testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie vnto them, that they are saued persons, if it were no more but that the holy Ghost saith of hearts contrite &amp; sorrowfull for their sinnes, that they are a sacrifice to God, and that the sobs and sighes of a troubled Spirit, greeued for iniquity, doe proceede from the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Surely this were sufficient to moue euery Christian to pray, and labour for this godly griefe, that he may get his heart touched with it, (the melting heart, the sostened heart, soone moued to griefe vpon sence of a sinne, is a blessed heart, the very habitation and lodging of God himselfe;) yet to heare further that our repentance occasioned by our griefe for sinne, is as a way wee are to walke in to saluation: this same ought to cause all men to be willing to haue this godly sorrow, and to know how they may attaine it. And albeit that the meditation of the filthinesse,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:3215:116"/>
and danger of sinne being committed against an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Iustice, the souereigne goodnesse, and a most holy Law, may much helpe to moue the heart, after a sinne to be aggreeued; yet nothing so auailable to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as the due and serious consideration of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The very Earth trembled at this, and shall not our hearts feare? the Sun was darkened, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen also put on mourning weede, and shall not wee be troubled? The stones rent, and shall not our hearts be rent with sorrow, and our eyes gush out with teares, vpon the sight and remembrance of such our sinnes, as we daily fall into, and by which we occasioned such an execrable death, with torment, to such an honourable person? As it cannot be but ill with them who can thinke of this, and not be displeased with themselues, and greeued at their sinnes which procured this; so well is that man that vpon the thought of his Sauiours sorrow for sinne, can haue his owne soule touched,

In this affection of sorrow, there be two sorts of persons which doe somewhat offend in diuerse sort; the one thinke they neuer greeue enough for their sinnes, and whereas they mourne much and truly, yet they satisfie not themselues, because they would haue and feele more. And the other, who doubt and mistrust themselues that they doe not greeue at all, and so are out of heart, because they haue no hearty greef for their offences, complaining of the hardnesse of their heart this way. Let the former consider that God respecteth not the measure so much, as the truth of our sorrow; if it be vnfeined, though it be not great, yet it is accepted; and if it prouoke to repentance, so as after griefe there follow some amendment, then it is vnfeined. And let this serue to comfort the heart, God being as well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to haue his Children cheered with his graces and the worke of his Spirit in them, as greeued for their tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes; it is not pleasing to him to see them alwayes sad, hanging downe their heads as a bul-rush: there is a time for sorrow, &amp; a time to reioyce. And for the other, their desire to be truly greeued for sinne, and to haue a
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:3215:117"/>

Woe to them which are secure, which sinne without all griefe, or suspect of any fault this way, and so lie still in their sinne without any turning or change: and woe to them whose sorrow is worldly, such as is stirred vp not for breach of Gods Law, but for dread or sence of vengeance, which rot still in their sinne; but happy, and thrice happy is the soule which without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Gods rods present, or his iudgement to come, without any regard either of the losse of Heauen, or paine of hell, can be affected with griefe after sinne in this onely consideration, that they haue failed in duty toward so louing a Father, and deserued by their sinne to lose his fauour. Of this sorrow there will follow a<note place="margin">Wherein Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth.</note> repentance, neuer to be repented of; which I thus open and make plaine to you.

we haue seene whence this speciall renewed repentance doth arise, and wherein it consists, the degrees would be a little examined, and I find that there is an ordinary Repentance meete to be had for ordinary sinnes. By ordinary sinnes, I meane the common slips of life, the faults that euery the most watchfull Christian doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily fall into, daily infirmities, in omission and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; for these there would be but ordinary griefe, and ordinary repentance, as aboue it hath beene decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But when any extraordinary sinnes doe happen, such as were <hi>Dauids, Peters, Manasses, Salomons,</hi> foule and notorious sinnes, which giue a greater wound to the conscience, and an offence to the Church, and more dishonour to Gods name, and worke a greater decay of godlinesse in the soule; there would be vsed a more extraordinary sorrow, the heart would bee wrought to a deeper humiliation, more feruent and frequent prayer, holpen with fasting: and vpon our rising out of such sinnes, more streight bonds would bee taken for our good abearing afterwards, serious vowes and protestations for a better life. Such was <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> after his fall, he wept bitterly: such also the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans that washed Christs feete with teares; <hi>Luke</hi> 7. Such was <hi>Dauids, Psalme</hi> 51. and many other, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some foule and enormious sinnes, haue performed more then ordinary repentance for daily and ordinary slips; which yet be such (considering the offence of so great a God in them,) as ought to moue much griefe &amp; displeasure with our selues, and more watchfulnesse. Now for the tokens or fruites of this renewed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, there be seauen reckoned vp, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. In that you were godly sorrie, what great care it hath wrought

                        <hi>Aquila,</hi> I doe well know that in these<note place="margin">7. Signes of renewed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> points all men are not of one mind: and whereas some call them tokens or signes, others call them rightly as you doe, effects or fruites of Repentance, I iudge it all one; they are therefore signes to manifest the truth of Repentance, because they are the proper and necessary effects of true Repentance. For their distinction of one from another, and what each is, this I vnderstand. Care, it is the study of the minde and thought taking,<note place="margin">1. Care.</note> how to approue the course of our life hereafter, both to God and to our owne conscience, and to the Church of God. As it fareth with Trauellers which haue by sloth or ignorance lost their way, hauing found it again, they are more carefull to keepe it: so it is with the godly when they repent, their care is to please God better af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards: the which their care doth expresse it selfe in the greatnesse of it, not onely in the generall course of their conuersation, but in euery particular action, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it according to the rules of the Word, that offence of God and men may be preuented; as <hi>Col.</hi> 1. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle prayeth for the faithfull, that they may please God in euery thing; and elsewhere, that they may abound in euery good worke. Yea, this care in the godly, as it is in themselues for eschewing one sinne as well as another, and for the doing one duty as wel as another; so it stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:3215:121"/>
it selfe vnto them of their charge, children, and seruants, or flocke and subiects, if they be publike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as is to be seene in the example of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>Iob, Iacob, Dauid, Iosiah,</hi> who all had care of their children and people, no lesse then of themselues; and this declareth ones care to be sound toward themselues when it embraceth others. Of all which it followeth, that all secure person, which haue no further or greater care, but for backe and belly, for pleasure and profit, are surely voide of repentance, being voide of this care how they may please God. So on the other side, the more that care encreaseth in any after their falles, to keepe the Word, and stand fast in their obedience to it, the more sure hee may be of the soundnesse of his repentance: for how must not his sorrow for losing his way, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be true, when his care is double to that it was, not to lose it againe?</p>
                     <p>The next fruite of Repentance, is clearing of our<note place="margin">Clearing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Or finally, by an humble &amp; true confessing of our fault to God and to men, if it were open and publike, with hearty crauing of pardon; as in the Publican, <hi>Zacheus, Dauid,</hi> we haue examples of this clearing: and well also might the godly <hi>Corinthians</hi> cleare themselues to <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <pb n="219" facs="tcp:3215:121"/>
that they were displeased with their sinne in bearing with such an offendour, not onely by their diligence in censuring him, but by their vnfeined confessing of the offence both to God and to the Apostle, whom they hadagreeued.</p>
                     <p>The third fruite it is indignation, which is an holy<note place="margin">3. Anger.</note> anger stirred vp in our hearts, not onely against other mens faults, with a pitty toward their person; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially against some sins which haue escaped our selues, that we-were so beastly and foolish as to doe such euils that we might haue auoyded; and when we are moued to anger more against our owne then other mens, this is a very good token of a repentant heart.</p>
                     <p>The fourth fruite is feare, not seruill, but filiall and<note place="margin">4 Feare. Blessed is the man that thus feareth.</note> child-like, arising from the feeling of Gods mercies and our owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The fifth is desire, as impenitent persons haue their<note place="margin">5. Desire.</note> desires to eate, to drinke, to sleepe, to take their ease and pastime, to fare deliciously, to goe gallantly and brauely in apparell, to grow rich, to be aloft, to be well thought of and spoken of, although they deserue it not; and are stuffed with many other such carnall and worldly desires, as tokens of their naturall impenitent heart; so the godly desire to liue honestly, to keepe a good conscience, to dwell in the House of God for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, to enioy the sincere milke of the word, to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened of sinne, to mortifie their lusts, be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and to be with Christ; and finally, not to offend againe in these particulars, wherin they haue offended

God, or his people, are the testimonies of a truly repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant heart.</p>
                     <p>The sixth fruite is zeale, which is a great griefe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued<note place="margin">6. Zeale.</note> for the hurt of Gods glory by sinne, and an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent loue to all such things as God may be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by; and to hinder in our selues and others whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer may dishonour or displease him; <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3. <hi>Repent, and be zealous.</hi> Therefore as cold and luke-warme Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, are vtterly without all grace of true Repentance, which worketh a zeale against all sinnes, and for all good, to crosse the one, and aduance the other, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our places &amp; meanes: so the truly zealous man, whose zeale is guided by the knowledge of the Word, and tempered with charity; such as was in <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> 14. in <hi>Phine as,</hi> in <hi>Moses,</hi> in <hi>Dauid;</hi> it is the euidence to our soules, that it is blessed with the grace of Repentance.</p>
                     <p>The last fruite is reuenge, which is not a requiting of<note place="margin">7. Reuenge.</note> euill for euill towards others, a fruite of the flesh: but a voluntary punishment which a sinner taketh vpon himselfe, for the euils done against his God &amp; his soule, or his brethren, in labouring more to bridle his vnruly heart from vnlawful desires, and moderating it in those which be lawfull; for bearing not sinfull delights or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits alone, but euen such things as are within our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if the vse of them will be an occasion of finne, either to our selues or other. This curbing of our selues, and cooping vp our affections, mortifying the flesh, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selues, is that reuenge here meant. Also, enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ones selfe to doe the things quite contrary to our sinnes; as the drunkard to repent, and punish himselfe with abstinence: also the glutton and riotous, with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting;

the great talker by keeping silence; the adulterer, by forbearing all things may prouoke lusts. Let me not conceale from you, that I iudge this reuenge, if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to be their exercising of that ecclesiasticall Authority, which God had giuen his Church against sinne, with more seuerity then wonted; that as they had offended by remissenesse, so they would henceforth take due reuenge vpon open sinners, according to the power giuen them of God. And this is very like; for it is a godly reuenge to set on worke all power, which God giueth vnto any for stopping of the course and current of sinne. Let Papists who take such vnlawfull, yet painfull reuenge of themselues, by whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, &amp;c. admonish true Christians to take all lawfull reuenge.</p>

                     <p>Herein I will answer your desire. But let<note place="margin">Meanes to quicken our daily Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> 'me tell you by the way, what was saide of the meanes to quicken and stirre vp this daily Repentance: Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, diligent reading of Scripture, and other godly Bookes; the humble submission of our mindes to all godly admonitions of the Saints, blessing God in our soule, after the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> for such rebukes as are priuately and friendly reached out; yea, thanking God for the reproaches of enemies, by whom some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time one shall heare his sinne tolde him sooner, then by a friend, though not in a good manner, nor for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good ende on their part: yet considering God sets them on worke, as <hi>Dauid</hi> the Prophet saide; <hi>God
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:3215:123"/>
hath bid him rebuke mee:</hi> Therefore endeauour our selues to make vse of them, giuing good heed both to the checkes of our conscience, which often proues a faithfull monitor, and to the strokes of Gods hand sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and insensible in soule and body; seeking to profit by them to amendment, that wee feare him the more, yea, euen in the dayes of our prosperity and peace, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this good vse to be inuited by them to speedy and true repentance; and so we shal preuent Gods chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if wee voluntarily fall to iudging of our selues. Yet of all other good meanes to awaken vs, and bring vs vnto the practise of Repentance, this is not the least, euen our daily examination of our owne heart and wayes, to consider particularly what escapes haue been in thoughts, words, and deeds, in omission or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, with the circumstances of our actions for manner of doing, and for the end of our workes, and the persons, and such like things; that so we may come to see both what is to be sorrowed for presently, and vpon faithfull and humble confession, we may make all euen with God through Christ for that which is past: and also what cause there is to watch ouer our selues for time to come, what remaines yet to be corrected and amended, that accordingly our prayers and care may encrease. As prouident House-keepers who haue great Families, preuent many losses and damages in their estate, by often viewing the reckonings and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of them whom they trust: so may sinnes be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by this godly examination of a mans owne counsels and workes. Now for the cautions herein to be followed, they are briefly these.<note place="margin">12. Cautions about Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>First let no Christian by his heedfull looking to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:3215:123"/>
thinke that euer he can attaine hereunto, as in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to offend. And therefore vpon the finding of his failings, not to be too much discouraged: for this is the common condition of all the Saints, that none liue and sinne not. 2. In the examination of ones selfe, let no man looke to find euery failing, there will be some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret sinnes. Euen <hi>Dauid,</hi> a man so wise, and well instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Law, shal not espie all the motes in his owne eye; <hi>Psal. 19. Who can tell his secret faults?</hi> 3. For these priuy faults which cannot be found, there would be a generall confession and asking of mercy for them; <hi>Lord forgiue me my vnknowne sinnes.</hi> 4. Knowne sins, which we shall discouer particularly, let them be speedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of; for herein delay is dangerous: and be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly acknowledged, the sinner accusing himselfe for them by name, and adiudging himselfe for them to death, with an appeale from Iustice to the Throne of Gracc for remission. 5. Let neuer a sinner for any knowne sinne, take further griefe, then as he may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble againe to comfort himselfe with promise of mercy. 6. As in practise of this daily Repentance, coldnesse by custome is to be be shunned; so on the other side, lest the heart waxe proud through the earnest care and wel performance of it, be not proud of Repentance. 7. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour still to find out new sinnes, and new omissions of duties, and to make them seeme more and more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hatefull to the soule; a sinner so he keepe his hold of Christ, cannot be too humble for sinne. 8. Take speciall notice amongst all other sinnes, of corruption of Nature, and the proannesse thereof to sinning; that all meanes be vsed for the weakening of that root, and the drayning of that fountaine. Let pardon be craued
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:3215:124"/>
in speciall for it, &amp; power asked against it. 9 Let not any sinne seeme little, though a difference in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is to be put, according as the sinne is ordinarie or extraordinary; yet let not any sin be thought smal, being the offence of a most great God, the breach of a most holy Law, cause of most bitter paines to Christ, meriting most wofull destruction. 10. Forget not to repent of negligences, ouersights, heedlessenesse, and to look well that these grow not too common. 11. For priuate sinne, priuate confession is enough; open sins, would haue open repentance, 12. Lastly, when anie knowne sinne is begun to be repented of, let it be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly repented of, euen to the shaking it off, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of it. He that confesseth his sinne, and forsaketh<note place="margin">Prou. 28.</note> it, shall find mercy. Now friend <hi>Aquila,</hi> let me heare your doubts, that I may answer them.</p>

                     <p>My first doubt is this; Whether a sinner<note place="margin">Some scruples about Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> may not truly repent, except he leaue his sins? Or hee may still vse a sinne, and yet repent?</p>

                     <p>First, an vnknowne sinne may be repented of, and yet not left. As amongst the Patriarks polyga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,<note place="margin">Of this kinde was fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thought to bee among the Corinthians.</note> or hauing at once more wiues then one, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines with their wiues, was the secret sinne which in those times was not manifested nor reckoned as a sin:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.</note> so they liued in it til their death, yet perished not for it;<note place="margin">Held in those times for nosin but some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diffrent thing.</note> which they shold haue done, if being known to them, yet witingly &amp; willingly with open eies they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in it. But they repented of it generally, as of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">So many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs, thinke of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest for lone of money.</note> secretsins. Likewise, there be diuers sins amongst vs, which are the sins of the time, yet not so esteemed; whereof the godly may truly repent, as of all their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne offences, and yet not leaue them, because they
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:3215:124"/>
do not take them to be sinnes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there is a knowne sinne, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

(at most) scar-crowes and bugges to make Children affraid: One blast of Gods mouth will disperse them, as the winde driueth chaffe before it. For reproch and nick-names the Word teacheth, that it was the lot of Prophets, Apostles, yea of Christ, to be scorned and<note place="margin">Mat. 5.

                     <p n="2">2. And as touching the other let, iudge how much rather one ought to suffer the displeasure of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly friends, then to liue out of Gods fauour, as they doe which liue in sinne without repentance. And who wil not esteeme the loue and liking of one godly person, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the distast and mislike of an hundred worldlings? Howbeit, who knoweth but that by his repentance, he may gaine euen his enemies to be his friends, as for impenitencie, God vseth to make friends to become enemies?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Neither ought the meane estate of such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and loue God, keepe any from entring into the good way of obedience to Gods will; not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are commanded to iudge righteously and in truth, not according to outward appearance; and then we should perceiue, that such as are basely esteemed in the world, are glorious before God in his sight; but also, because they are pronounced blessed, which are not offended in Christ, that is, which stumble not at the meannesse of Christ, or his little flocke his poore followers. For as they are affirmed to persecute Christ,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:3215:130"/>
which persecute his members, and to feede and cloath<note place="margin">Math. 25.</note> Christ, which do these things to his members; so the being offended with the pouerty and simplicity of his members, is to be offended with Christ. They which now refraine to embrace sincerely the trueth, because of the fewnesse or small regard of such as bee his true followers; if Christ himselfe were amongst vs, the homelinesse of his person and state would offend them, and turne them from receiuing his doctrine.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Lastly, least of all is any to be held from the way of Repentance, through the euil customes of the time; which being euil are therefore to be forsaken, though they be customes. Customes howsoeuer old, yet se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from truth and vprightnesse, are but old errors. Neither are we to liue by customes, but by the statutes and commandements of God; not to follow multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, but to choose rather to thinke and do well with a few good, then to erre and do naughtily with manie which be euil. Better it were for vs to walk in the good way of repentance though it be narrow, and they but a few which finde and vse it, because at last it leadeth to life; then to go in the way of security &amp; sin, though it be broad, and many treade in it, because in fine, it brings to destruction.</p>
                     <p>And what matters it to vs, how professors doe liue, or our Teachers or fore-fathers, saue onely that wee are to greeue if they liue not wel, to pity them, to pray for them, to helpe as we may to reclaime them. But in no wise to take their life as a rule, or to take an offence from their walking. For Christ is to be imitated, and not men; namely, in that wherein they leaue and goe from Christ, 1 Cor. 11, 1. And there is a woe aswel to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:3215:130"/>
such as take an offence, as to them which giue: for woe is to the World because of offences. And we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to doe as Teachers doe, when they teach wel, and doe ill. Haue ye any more hinderances of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance yet behind vnnamed?</p>

                     <p>Indeed (as I touched afore) the gate of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is streight, it is a narrow way, it will paine vs and pinch vs to walke in it; but the benefit will quit the labour: it will take vp much time and trauaile to leaue sinne. See how much adoe, and what a while it is ere we can leaue but one sinne especially if it be a sinne of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to which we are more addicted; or of our trade, by which we sucke some aduantage; or of the time, wherein there be many to beare vs company. I say then, to leaue so many sinnes, and to liue well, to doe so many duties, will craue both space and sweate: but the fruite will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite the charge. The haruest of Repentance <hi>is eternall life;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10, 11. as the croppe of sinne is eternall death. Consider also though it be painfull to leaue sin, and to exercise Repentance, yet it is surely as painefull to exercise sinne. I dare boldly affirme it, to liue in sinne, is as painefull (if not more painefull) then to liue well.</p>
                     <p>Sinners doe not fulfill their lusts with such ease; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the Drunkard, Theese, Epicure, Gamester, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous, proud, ambitious, which take great paines, put themselues to great hazard, watch whole nights, and labour whole dayes for compassing and enioying their
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:3215:131"/>
vnlawfull desires; so as all ends put together, to practise sinne, is as hard as to practise righteousnesse: which hath the sweete peace of conscience, liberty of minde, and ioy of heart, to mittigate much the pain and labour which is endured about it. But most sure I am of this, that to repent and liue well, according to Gods will, is nothing so painefull as to liue in hell fire; whatsoeuer the paine or perill of well doing is, it is not matchable with hell paine. Therefore let our sluggish nature be rowsed, and enured vnto diligence in seeking after the Kingdome of Heauen: better here to endure the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and paine which doth accompany godlinesse, how great soeuer it be, then to endure the paine of our sinnes for euer in that lake which burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone. It will also helpe vs against this temptation of our slothfulnesse, to call to minde not onely, that ease slayeth the foolish; but what hurt it doth in the meane time to the godly which doe yeeld to it. How did the Church lament and smart; <hi>Cantic.</hi> 5. 3. because shee would not rise in the night and put on her cloathes, and wet her foote a little to open the doore to Christ? I say, how did the Church there sinart for this her sloth? shee was for a time punished with the absence of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Christ, more bitter then death to her; also with astonishment and dulnesse of heart for her sinne: and lastly, with the cruelty of euill Pastors which fell vpon her, and beate her, and ill entreated her.</p>

                        </gap> in the seruice of any sinne, maketh Repentance more difficult, but not desperate and impossible. As one that is farre gone out of his way, or hath suffered a wound or a sicknesse, to goe on long without looking to it, makes their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and recouery more hard, but takes not away all hope: Right so the long abiding in any sinne, it doth craue great care to repent and amend it. But as they which haue foreslowed their fields or gardens, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be ouergrowne with weeds, or which haue neglected their time in the beginning of a day, so as they haue more worke on their hand when night ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth; they vse to recompence their former care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse with encrease of paines: So Christians which haue spent too much time in following their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and walking after the course of this world, all they haue to doe, it is to redeeme the time; and then doing their best endeauour, doubling their care and paines, because their sinnes are many &amp; strong, and their time but short which is behind: yet this is their comfort, that Iesus Christ can as easily change an heart that hath long accustomed it selfe to doe euill, as another heart which is not yet hardened by the custome of sin; this is a sure truth that hee will helpe the well willing minde. Therefore let not care of Repentance be cast off, but be so much the greater, as the neede is more; and then our good Lord will himselfe doe the rest. Get first the mastery of one sinne, and then of another, and so of a third; and thus setting vpon them one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the victory will be more easie: for as sinne grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth weaker, so the sinner will grow in strength. An old
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:3215:132"/>
man cannot become young againe, but an old sinner may proue a new man by Christs grace, and his owne labour. Lastly, they are deceiued in thinking they can keepe where they are; for the sinner that growes not better, must needs waxe worse: he that goes not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, goes backward, no man stands at a stay.</p>

                     <p>I heard you say, that there were some sinnes which being publike, require a publike repentance; this I tell you many good minds sticke at, and thinke it too great a shame, and so are kept from doing it: hoping that vpon their priuate sorrow and confession, God will for Christ his Sonne pardon them.</p>

                     <p>Indeed <hi>Aquila,</hi> now ye touch a boyle, ye rub the sore; there be honest minds not well enformed which cannot brooke this, though it concerne not themselues. They take it to be too seuere a discipline; one matter is, they liue not vnder such a strict disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.</note> it would seeme nothing if they liued in a place where such things vse to be done. If Theeues were not accustomed to die for their theft, it would bee thought too rigorous to bring in such a penalty. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, they doe not well consider the equity of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; for as a publike fault would haue a publike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, so it would haue a publike repentance: a priuate repentance and submission, is too narrow a playster for so broad a wound as an open scandall. Where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are offended with a crime commonly knowne, the wound being great, it had need of an answerable salue, that humiliation and satisfaction be giuen and made to many. If Christ haue commanded that for a priuate offence, one shall goe to his brother, and say; <hi>Forgiue me, it repents me:</hi> shall we not thinke it meet that where
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:3215:132"/>
a publike offence is giuen to a whole congregation, there the like ought to be done? shall one brother of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended be respected, and shall the whole fellowshippe and society of brethren be despised? If one hurt but one member, he is bound to make mee amends, how much more if hee hurt my whole body? Againe, it is best for the offending person thus to doe; for by his readinessc <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> vndergoe a publike infamy, taking vpon him the reproach of his sinne willingly, hee shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his repentance to be true and sound; and so not onely be receiued more gladly into fauour of men, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon such good proof of his conuersation, but also pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase more peace to his owne conscience with God: which assuredly can neuer enioy comfortable rest, till he obey this Ordinance of Christ, in satisfying whom he hath offended. Further, by this example of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, he shall doe others good; both by striking into them terrour, not to deserue by their sinne to come vnto a publike abasing themselues before many; and to giue encouragement by their example of such their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, vnto such as shall in like manner offend by publike crime. Moreouer, it will stop the mouthes of the aduerfaries of Gods truth, when they shal perceiue sinne not to be borne withall in any of the Children of the Church. And finally, great glory shall hereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound vnto God, when his truth and mercies in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse of great sinnes, shall be openly acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and obedience yeelded vnto his owne appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. By these, and the like considerations, no doubt euen the holy man, and princely Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing giuen a generall scandall in his sinne with <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba,</hi>

and his royall dignity, and to beare the publike shame of his sinne, setting himselfe by that 51. <hi>Psalme</hi> as it were vpon a stage, that God might haue glory, and his Church edified by such an example. Which also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>Salomon</hi> his sonne in like manner, after his gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous fall and generall scandall, to publish his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the Church, in his Booke <hi>Ecclesiastes:</hi> and it is<note place="margin">Ecclesiastes,</note> not to be doubted of the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> as their sinne in bearing with the incestuous person was open, so both his and their repentance was open, and made known. We see the Apostle to blaze out, and proclaime their Repentance for their offence, that all men might<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 11.</note> take notice of their sorrow, as their sinne was too much knowne; which in truth (if things be rightly weighed) is rather the sinners honour, then his shame: it being a shame to sinne, but none to repent, and to be knowne so to doe; which rather wipeth out their shame both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and men, and restoreth the former estimation vnto them. It were a foule deserued shame indeed, to be knowne to haue done a sinne, and not to be knowne to haue repented of that sinne; this would argue an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate, carelesse, desperate, impenitent person. I pray you who doth the lesse, nay, who doth not now more honourably thinke of King <hi>Dauid,</hi> in that he (such a person) would submit himselfe to such a discipline vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, hauing no authority aboue him in Earth to enioyne it to him? it is his renowne to this day, and wil be to the Worlds ende. And finally, where you say, they may repent priuately, and hope for pardon; this is all I say, I doe more then doubt it: I would be loath to loose that sinner by pronouncing forgiuenes of his sins, who being made to know thus much of his duty vnto
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:3215:133"/>
God, and the Church, and his owne soule; yet should refuse to doe it, hoping that God would be good to him, if hee doe in secret repent. Might not <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> haue thought so, and others also, who haue done as they did? Nay, friend <hi>Aquila,</hi> then may a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner looke for Gods fauour, when hee readily and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully walkes in Gods way; and Gods way is publike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for publike scandals, when he feeles his heart so affected toward God for the doing his will, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth his honour, as that in regard thereof he doth little or nothing recount of his owne credite; this is a good token that all is pardoned him.

                     <p>This it is. That as the Elect in their Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication<note place="margin">True Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery sinne, to do euery good worke.</note> haue, thogh not a perfect, yet a generall change and reformation in mind and reason, will and affection, body and actions; in all these they are somewhat, and that truly altered by grace of new birth, though vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly: So in the practise of this grace, the regenerate man repenteth him not for one, two, or a few; but of his whole corruption, and of all euill fruits of his naturall corruption. Albeit he cannot vtterly be without sinne in this life, no more then he can be without a soule and body; yet he doth not willingly nor wittingly foster nor harbour any sinne whatsoeuer, but is equally an enemy to all and euery sinne, though with vnequall successe; labouring daily and nightly the forsaking and shaking off of all their sinnes, in a true loathing of them: for the godly repentant persons haue learned of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iames 2. 10.</note> that to be guilty of one, maketh a man guilty of all; it being the same God that commanded all, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded one: so that his authority is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

10. 1. Also in the example of that godly man, King <hi>Dauid,</hi> they see this duty as in a glasse: for he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth of himselfe, that he hateth whatsoeuer, his owne wickednesse; <hi>Psalme</hi> 18. 22. And surely it cannot be that any man should truly repent of other sins, though he leaue the practise of them, if he doe loue and keepe any one knowne sinne; neither he that hateth any sinne, can be thought other, but that he hath repented of all: for hee hauing power in his Sanctification against all, doth therefore bend himselfe against all; and hating one sinne, in as much as therein is the displeasure and offence of his heauenly Father, vpon this ground will hate and greeue for euery sinne, with endeuour against it: but whosoeuer retaineth a liking in his heart to any sinne, with a purpose (though he know of it to be a sin; and his conscience checke him for it) to continue in it, can indeed hate no sinne at all; though he leane the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act of many sinnes, as <hi>Herod,</hi> as <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> as <hi>Iudas</hi> did for worldly fame, or feare of hell punishment denounced by the Word. True it is, that euen regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ones, who haue shaken off their sinnes, haue haply some sinne or sinnes hanging about them, as burres or<note place="margin">Simile.</note> lime, which yet they would not haue so; and they beare them not onely with checke of conscience, and mislike in iudgement (for so the wicked ones may doe) but with vnfeined sorrow of heart, greeued according to God, that they should be so yoked and entangled with the remnants of their corruption; and they striue vnder hope, more and more to ouercome those lingering vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; as they haue conquered their fellowes and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuce hath taught, that there is not any of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but as they haue corruption left in them, euen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:3215:135"/>
new birth for such purposes (as God would) to humble them, to exercise and stirre vp the gift of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to make them watchfull, to declare his owne grace in forgiuing, and might in vpholding, and for other such like ends: so in the whole host and army of their remaining sinnes, there is some more rebellious and mutinous then the rest, a predominant corruption, wherewith they are faine to wrestle hard, mightily, and long, ere they can put it downe. Euery man hath one<note place="margin">Simile.</note> or other outward enemy more tedious then the rest sent to vexe him, and to humble him; likewise there is some one inward sinful affection, that doth longer and more greeuously trouble them then all the rest doe: But a regenerate man will be at no league, nor take any<note place="margin">Simile.</note> truce with it; he stands at defiance, euen as <hi>I srael</hi> did with the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> whom they were to prosecute, to<note place="margin">Exod. 17. 14.</note> the rooting of them out, and did so. Right so doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery repentant person prosecute all his vicious lusts (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially his most dangerous lusts) vnto the rooting them out: for he wel knoweth, that it were in a manner as good to keepe all sinnes, as to hold one vnrepented of; one being sufficient for Sathan to ensnare vs by it. Yet one will not be one, and alone; but as one theese<note place="margin">Simile.</note> within the house, makes way for all the rest to follow after: so one sinne cherished, will open a window for others to come in. To conclude, if the heart be false in one sinne, it wil be false in more, as occasion is offered, and as temptations doe prouoke; and when the heart is framed to vprightnesse and truth by the Spirit of Sanctification, though it do not alike preuaile against euery sinne, yet it doth vnfeinedly detest and resist one sinne, as well as another. Againe, the like is to be saide
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:3215:135"/>
for the doing of good, that the regenerate, though he cannot absolutely keep the Law, to fulfil it in the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof, by doing all that good that is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there, and that vnto the end, and in all perfection of loue; nay, there be sundry good duties and workes, which our regenerate man through ignorance cannot so much as attaine to the knowledge of, (so large and broade be the Commandements, and so narrow and dull is our capacity): yet as he is sanctified throughout, hauing all his powers of spirit, soule and body, well and aptly disposed by grace to doe good; so he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth to know better euery day what his worke is which is prescribed him to doe, and also to performe it in euery part, so farre as it is knowne, with such perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as he can; doing his worke in truth and vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, though with wants and weaknesse: so as he balkes no duties. He will not play the Pope, to giue himselfe dispensation for any good worke which he is bound to doe, doe it neuer so much goe against his stomacke, and contrary his corrupt iudgement and affection, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or delight: yet <hi>his heart standeth with the Law; Rom.</hi> 7. 16. and with that hee will take part euen against his owne lusts, repenting him earnestly of his failings in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whether it come of ignorance or infirmity, being still more desirous to come neerer and neerer to God in true righteousnesse.

                     <p>Sir, this was well remembred.

which pertaine to him: so as his will and purpose of heart, is (so farre as measure of grace will allow and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him) with readinesse to doe whatsoeuer the Lord shall say vnto him, either for leauing euill vndone, or for doing that which is good.

                     <p>After the doctrine of Repentance, ye doe in very good time moue me for the doctrine of good workes, which follow Repentance, as the shadow doth<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the body, and flow from it as a Riuer from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, or as fruite springeth from the tree. Repentance lying hid in the heart as the iuyce or sappe in the roote of the tree, vttereth it selfe by good workes, as by meet and conuenient fruites. This is it which we may marke in the Scripture, how the holy Ghost hath matched re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and good works together; shewing that they should repent, and doe <hi>workes worthy of Repentance; Acts</hi> 26. 20. Againe, <hi>Repent, and doe the first workes; Reuel.</hi> 2. 5. Also, <hi>Bring therefore fruits worthy of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:3215:137"/>
Mathew</hi> 3. 8. Where it is to be noted, that a good worke, is called a fruite; not onely to shew how God accepteth them, euen as a pleasant fruite is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">Simile.</note> of him that dresseth a Vineyard, or an Orchard; but in respect as they come from Repentance, as a fruite from a Tree. And whereas he calleth it a fruite worthy of Repentance, he meaneth such workes as be meet for<note place="margin">Worthinesse put for meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, for vnmeetely;</note> such persons to doe, as haue repented. Consider also, that it cannot be, that a man inwardly should loue that which is righteous, and hate iniquity in his soule; but hee must needs outwardly expresse it, as occasion and<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 27.</note> meanes be offered: so as that Repentance may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 7.</note> suspected to be false, where good workes doe not follow; there is no true change in the heart, where there is none seene in the life. If we search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we cannot find any who haue repented in truth; but they haue beene afterwards carefull to doe good workes. To omit other examples, whereof Scripture affoords vs store, take one or two in stead of all. <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> repented, and his repentance was fruitfull, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing it selfe by good workes, both by retribution of<note place="margin">Luke 19. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> goods euilly gotten, and by distributing of well gotten goods; also, by a cheerefull entertainment of Christ. The conuerted theefe, as little space as he had after his conuersion, yet how many wayes did his repentance declare it selfe? namely, by the reproofe and admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his fellow, by admirable patience, by godly prayer, by iustifying and defending Christ his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, when he was condemned of all the Iewes, and doing it before them euen to their faces; also by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing his glory in their hearing, and his owne sinne<note place="margin">Luke 23.</note> and shame against himselfe. And as it is in the first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:3215:137"/>
when a sinner is newly conuerted; so also it fareth with renewed repentance, which vttereth it selfe by the fruite of good workes; as is manifest in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of <hi>Dauid</hi> after his fall with <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> which brought forth diuers good workes; as instruction of the Church, praise of God, both priuate and publike; confession of his sinnes, euen to the cracking and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his priuate estimation and royall dignity. So in <hi>Peters</hi> repentance, the like is to be seen, as his teares, his confirmation of others, and infinite good deedes more, testifying the truth of his repentance.</p>

                     <p>This certainely is so; therefore by good workes or amendment of life, we are to iudge of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance (as of a tree by the fruit:) the Repentance is dead which is without amendment, euen as faith is dead which is without good workes. But now I would<note place="margin">Iames 2. 26.</note> haue you tell me, which workes wee shall call good workes, and what things are necessarily required to a worke, that it may be reckoned a good worke?</p>

                     <speaker>Apollos.</speaker>
                     <p>For your first question, what a good worke<note place="margin">What a good worke is?</note> is; I say, it is euery duty which concerneth God or men, others or our selues; whether it bee performed in thought, word, or deed; either in our generall calling, as we are Christians, or particularly in our vocations which wee haue in Family, Common-wealth, or Church. Thus the worke of the Ministery in teaching, reprouing, conuincing, instructing, though it be done in words; yet it is called a good worke: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Being made perfect to all good workes.</hi> The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of the oyntment on Christs head; <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. is there called a good worke: <hi>Shee hath done a good worke vpon me. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> offering of <hi>Isaac;</hi> is of <hi>Iames</hi> called, <hi>A good
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:3215:138"/>
worke; Iames</hi> 2. 21. And not to be long in this plaine matter, the Scripture saying; that we must be <hi>iudged by our workes; Rom.</hi> 2. 6. And in <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. <hi>Salomon</hi> doth affirme, that <hi>euery secret thing shall come to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And Christ saith, that <hi>an account shall be giuen of euery idle word; Mat.</hi> 12. 36. It is by this apparent, that as secret thoughts and words, if they be euill, are to be numbred amongst bad workes; so thoughts and words being good, are to be esteemed for good workes; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Scripture in so many places so largely vsing this phrase of good workes for all fruites of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as we haue seene before: therefore they doe erre which thinke workes of mercy to be the onely good workes required at our hands.</p>
                     <p>Now to your second question; what is required to<note place="margin">How many things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a good worke.</note> a worke, that it may be held for a good worke? There must goe these three things. First, the matter and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Secondly, the person must be good. Thirdly, the end; all these must be good. A good worke for the stuffe, substance, and matter, must be commanded in the Word of God: for besides that, wee are willed to<note place="margin">1. Good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> doe that onely which God commanded, and not to<note place="margin">Deut. 12. verse last.</note> turne therefrom to the right hand or to the left. And wee reade also in the Word, that of all things done without warrant of his Word (as thereby to please and serue him) he will say; <hi>Who required these things at your hands?</hi> Sound reason may tell vs, that nothing is to be held for a good worke, saue that which God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to be done; because his will onely is the rule of all righteousnesse: so as a worke is then righteous and good, when it is agreeable to his reuealed will; and when it swarueth therefrom it is euill. The will of God being (I say) as the leuell, lime, or rule, to direct our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:3215:138"/>
which are straight or crooked, as they come nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer or goe farther from that line. Moreouer, the seruice of God standing in this, that we doe such good workes, by which he is serued and worshipped of vs; and he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of no seruice saue that which is done according to his owne will: therefore they cannot be esteemed for good workes, which hee willeth not to be done in his Word. <hi>In vatne doe they serue and worship me</hi> (saith the Lord by his Prophet) <hi>teaching my feare by the Precepts of men; Esay</hi> 29. 13. Which reproueth, first of all some ignorant Christians, who hearing of good workes to be done, cannot stretch their thoughts beyond workes of mercy, commonly called, Almes deeds, as if these one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were meant by good workes; or not beyond exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Acts, which incurre into our senses. Moreouer, they offend, which imagine that all they doe vpon a good intent and meaning, should straight way haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance before God for a good worke; whereas in truth no intent is worthy to be held for a good intent, (whatsoeuer seemeth to vs) saue that which is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods will. Not what we deeme to be good, is therefore by and by good, for that it appeares so to vs; but what God will approue for good, that indeed must stand for good: not ours, but his will, being the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of goodnesse. How many might we call to mind, who haue thought to doe some good thing, and yet haue beene refused of God, because they consulted not with his word, to square their meaning thereafter? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of <hi>Vzza</hi> putting his hand to stay the Arke, of <hi>Peter</hi> counselling Christ not to goe to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to suffer; and<note place="margin">2 Kings 26. from verse 16. till verse 21.</note> going with <hi>Iohn</hi> his fellow Apostle into the high Priests house: all being done of good intention, &amp; yet we know how ill it was taken of God, &amp; might haue proued their eternall ruine.</p>

They faile in this first part of a good worke, they doe not bring the stuffe and substance whereof a good worke is made: which must be (as we haue saide) something comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of God in his Law, not deuised of men in their owne braine; for whatsoeuer man deuiseth therewith to please God, it is abominable in deed, be it neuer so goodly in shew; <hi>Luke 16, 15.</hi>

                     <speaker>Apollos.</speaker>
                     <p>As it is required that the thing to be done, or matter of the worke be good, being approued of God; so the next thing is, that the man be good which<note place="margin">2. Perso good, that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may be good.</note> doth the worke, the goodnesse of the worker: and the third thing is, that the end be good for which it is done. <hi>First</hi> (saith our Sauiour) <hi>make the tree good, and then the fruite will be good:</hi> for <hi>a good tree cannot bring forth euill fruite; Mat.</hi> 12. 33. It is not the good worke that makes the person good, as the fruite makes not the<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that makes the person good, as the fruite makes not the tree good; nor the Riuer makes not the Fountaine sweete: but the person being first good, that which he doth according to Gods will, becomes good. And as it is amongst men, that we cannot like a gift, when wee<note place="margin">Simile.</note> brooke not the giuer; so it is with God: hee neuer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts any thing that is done, how good soeuer in the nature of the thing done, except the doer be first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:3215:139"/>
Now that which maketh the doer good, it is his faith in Christ, whereby hee is purged from all his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and hath the righteousnesse of Christ accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, to make him righteous in the sight of God. Hence it is, that no worke of ours can please God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it come from faith. Hence also it is, that the works which wee doe, borrow all their commendations euen from hence; that they are the children of faith, begotten and brought forth by it: See <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 11. throughout. From hence it was, that <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> offering each sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto God, <hi>Caines</hi> sacrifice was reiected, and <hi>Abels</hi> receiued and pronounced to be better then <hi>Caines,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was offered in faith. <hi>Abraham</hi> offering his sonne (though the work were strange &amp; exceeding wondrous) yet it had had no grace nor respect with God, except it had come from faith. What shall I say more? a poore Kitchen-maid, an Hostler, a Chimney-sweeper, or any other, how base soeuer their trade be, being a lawfull vocation; if he doe his worke out of a true faith in God through Christ, and out of obedience of Gods will, his worke is more glorious and pleasing in Gods sight, then the best and most goodly worke of a King, or of a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, being not faithfully and obediently performed. Whereof it is written, that many things which are great &amp; glorious amongst men, are abominable before God: for if faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> vs not a worke to doe our workes, let them be how bright or glittering soeuer for shew and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to men, yea, and very profitable for fruite toward men; yet they are no better then beautifull sinnes. So the holy Ghost teacheth, that what is done without <hi>faith, it is sinne; Rom.</hi> 14. 23. And that without <hi>faith, it is impossible to please God; Heb.</hi> 11. 6. Now wee are
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:3215:140"/>
here to consider, that faith in euery good worke, doth<note place="margin">A threefold act of Faith in euery good worke.</note> set it selfe a worke three manner of wayes. Or thus (if ye will) the act of faith in a good worke, it is threefold. The first is to enable vs to know, that the thing which we doe, it is such as God alloweth of, being comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him. The perswasion hereof, it is called <hi>Faith; Rom.</hi> 14. 22, 23. <hi>He that doubteth, sinneth if he eate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he eateth not of faith:</hi> that is, out of a perswasion and certainty that he doth well. The second act of faith it is to assure the minde, that this worke which wee are resolued of, to be in it selfe lawfull to be done; it is such as God will accept through Christ, pardoning the spots and imperfections of it freely for his merit: for all out workes hauing their staines and defects (as wee haue touched in our Treatise of vnperfect Sanctification, and shall hereafter declare) it is of necessity that there be an application of Christs merits to our workes, for the cleansing of them; that so they may please God. This is done by faith, whereby the heart is assured, that God, who hath graciously loued vs in his beloued, will<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5.</note> also vouchsafe for his sake, to be pleased with that wee doe after his will.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly and lastly, there is another worke of faith, and that is it which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of; <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Faith worketh by loue:</hi> for it quickeneth and stirreth the heart to the loue of God and man, in our good workes which we doe, to be led not by selfe-loue and carnal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, but by this charity and louing affection of our<note place="margin">

This being the end of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, euen loue out of a pure heart, and faith vnfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:3215:140"/>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. Now whosoeuer truly beleeueth in Christ Iesus, that through him hee is reconciled vnto God, and hath his offences forgiuen him: this faith will moue him to loue that God againe sincerely, and his Neighbour for Gods sake, who commanded it to be so, and hath put his Image in him, and vpon him; that all our workes comming out of this sound loue to God and our brethren, wee may abandon all by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

This<note place="margin">3. Good end.</note> is a third maine condition in euery good worke, that the end and marke whereat the doer aimeth, be good and right: the badnesse of the end marres the goodnesse<note place="margin">Actions are measured by their ends.</note> of the action. He that takes a good thing in hand, and propounds a wrong scope, he is like to one who hath<note place="margin">Simile.</note> a good bow and arrowes to shoote withall, but looketh from the marke when he shooteth, such an one shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer shoote well. Here is the priuiledge of faithfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that by the Spirit of God they are carried in their willes and affections to desire and seeke in all that they doe, Gods glory, and the edification of their brethren, euen in truth and singlenesse of heart, and not in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession onely, as hypocrites who will talke much of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying God, when their eye is neuer bent to this marke, but rather is cast-vpon their owne glory; which (as the hearbe <hi>Colloquintida</hi>) marreth euery worke that is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with it: but the Child of God hauing learned, that all his workes must come from God, as the Authour, and looke vnto God as their end (like as the Riuers which come originally out of the Sea, and returne thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:3215:141"/>
again.) Therefore as he desireth to please his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in that which is good for his edifying, minding this still in all such things as doe concerne his brethren, how hee may better and helpe them either to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or some other wise: so he desireth that by his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience &amp; good workes which he doth euen in the least of them, in his eating and drinking, and in his honest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, and not onely in the serious businesse of his calling and seruice of God; but in euery thing which he doth, he may doe them to Gods glory; that others vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon sight and knowledge of his carriage in his duties, may be occasioned, if they be conuerted, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Gods worke in him, to the glory of God: if not, that then by his example they may be won &amp; drawne to godlinesse, and so to glorifie God in the day of their visitation. Finally, in the doing of a good worke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all the former conditions, it is needfull that the meanes be good, when meanes are needfull. Men may<note place="margin">4.

Wherein great wisedome is required, to be able to discerne of these, how to doe good things meetely and fitly according to time, and other circumstances: for the missing or failing but in a circumstance, through lacke of discretion and good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, or fore-sight rather, hath caused many good workes to miscarry, and haue full heauy successe. Of all this it followeth, that no euill man can do a good work; <hi>If the tree be euill, the fruite will be euill; Mal.</hi> 12. And that good men neede wonderfull care and circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as also feruent prayer for great aide from God, to be enabled to doe such things, as shall be good when they are done: but here withall let it be obserued, that when they haue done all, and brought with them all the conditions of a good worke, yet their worke will still haue both wants and blemishes. As cleere water that passeth thorow a muddy chanell, or pure liquour put into a musty caske, takes corruption from them: so our workes as they passe through our vnderstanding, and will, which are not renewed but in part, and are partly flesh; therefore draw filth and vncleannesse from our inbred corruption, to the defiling of them; yea, and iustly deseruing that they should be refused, and we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the doers: as certainly they would be, if with the eye of rigorous and exact iustice God should behold them.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:3215:142"/>
Whence it is, that no godly man can be iustified by his workes: for the workes of the Law doe make vs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God, when they are fully performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the least default; for then euen by the compact of Gods owne mouth, saying, <hi>Doe this, and liue; Gal.</hi> 3. there belongs vnto them (as a debt) eternall life. But sithence none euer kept the Law thus since mans fall, saue Christ; therefore Righteousnes is not to be sought by the Law: which rather reuealeth our vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and Gods wrath against the same. And as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible the Law should iustifie vs, because of the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity which is in vs, whereby we are hindered from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering the strictnesse of it: so we neede not fetch Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse from the Law, because we haue it by grace, imputing freely to the beleeuers the doings and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Christ for our perfect iustice with God; besides, our good workes following our Iustification, as fruites &amp; effects, they cannot goe before as causes of it. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Christians are to be admonished, to lay aside all opinion of their owne Righteousnesse, as not thinking euer to obtaine life from God by their good doings, be they neuer so many or worthy, when as one sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone spoyles all the righteousnesse of our workes; euen as one droppe of Inke doth spoyle a whole goblet of Wine.

                     <p>Now the intention of God in offering such great &amp; manifold recompence being this, to quicken his owne vnto all manner of loue and obedience towards him: it is therefore very meete and lawfull, yea necessarie, that Gods children should by such encouragements hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten themselues in their course.

                     <p>Loue is such an affection of the heart, as<note place="margin">Loue of God: what it is to loue.</note> desireth to be knit and neerely ioyned to the thing or party loued. This is the nature of loue, so to carry the<note place="margin">1. Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> heart with desire vnto that which is loued, as nothing will content till it be enioyed and had. The trueth of this may appeare in that loue which is inordinate: and also in all well gouerned loue. The theefe, the adulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, the gamester, the couetous, are by their loue (such as they beare to their booty, their whores, their game, and gaine) so possessed, as they are then quyet and not
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:3215:150"/>
before, when they haue and bee ioyned in one to that which they loue: as their parting from the thing loued and losing it is their greefe, yea sometime their death: so their being with it, and hauing it, is their content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ioy, and life. Stories and experience afford vs sufficient proofe heereof. We see the Gamester ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer well but when hee is at dice, or cardes, or other game. The Fornicator is neuer at rest, vnlesse he bee with his harlot. The Couetous man is best pleased, when he lookes vpon, or fingereth money. Now, in well-gouerned loue it is right so, whether it bee natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or humane, or religious. Beasts which out of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall instinct do loue their yong, how do they fare? what discontentment they shew when their yong are taken from them? How doe Parents greeue and take on for the death or absence of their children whom they loue; being well pleased and delighted when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy their presence and company? In that humane loue which is amongst friends, it fareth after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Let the example of <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> teach it, 2 Sam. ch. 1. What pleasure tooke they in each others presence and wel-fare? And how bitter was it to <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> heart, that it should go amisse with <hi>Dauid,</hi> and to <hi>Dauids</hi> to misse <hi>Ionathan</hi> his friend, whom he loued as a wife her husband?</p>
                     <p>This is also the nature of religious loue: Such as<note place="margin">What it is to loue God.</note> loue God, or Christ, or his word, or people, they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet to be linked vnto them as neerely as may bee, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting themselues in the partaking with them, being much troubled for the want of them: as is to be seene in the example of the Church in the Canticles, Cant. 5, 6. when her beloued was for a time gone from her:
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:3215:150"/>
and euery faithfull soule findeth it to bee their griefe, to be held a while from the word, or from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, or conference with God. See Psal. 42. also Psa. 84, 1, 2, 3. vpon all which I conclude, That the loue of God is that affection which maketh the christian soule take comfort &amp; contentment in the communion with God, desiring and delighting to be more and more streightly knit to him, and more fully to participate in him and in his gracious blessings and loue tokens.</p>
                     <p>Sundry are the causes for which Gods people ought<note place="margin">Why God is to be loued.</note> to loue him thus: For, they are his creatures, he their maker; they his seruants, hee their Lord; they his friends, and which is more, his children, &amp; he their deere Father in Christ; yea they his spouse, hee their husband: so as they are tyed and bound to him by all bonds of loue and duty: God beeing vnto them in a most speciall manner all these things wee haue sayde. Moreouer, he loued them first, before they loued him; yea being his enemies, hee loued vs when wee hated him, and gaue vs a sufficient pawne of his loue, euen his owne Sonne, to be a man, to bee a seruant, yea to be a slaine sacrifice for vs. And withall, hath by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit which he hath giuen vs, shed abroad this loue in our hearts. Vnto all which, if we will adde the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of all the good which he hath already done to vs in our bodies and mindes, in earthly and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and the great things which we hope to haue heereafter, and the straite commandement which it laide vpon vs, to loue the Lord our God; and that if we loue him, the commodity is not to him, but to our<note place="margin">How much God is to be loued.</note> selues: then will it easily appeare, how diuerslie and greatly we are obliged to this God, to render him this
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:3215:151"/>
duty of loue; where in that we may proceede well, we are to know, that as our measure of louing him, must be to loue him aboue measure, as he hath loued vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, and is that most perfect goodnes and beauty worthy of perfect loue: so our rule to guide our loue,<note place="margin">By what rule our loue is to be guided.</note> is to loue him, not for his benefites and good things onely or cheefe, but to loue all other things in God, and for God, and God for himselfe, euen for his most sweete and gracious mercies, and for his vnmeasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble holinesse and truth.</p>
                     <p>This is ingenuous and filiall loue, such as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth children. The other, being that which ariseth from his blessings principally or solely, is mercenary and meete for slaues or seruants. For though the blessings of God bee such as deserue at our hands not onely thankfulnesse, but encrease of loue and obedience, yet wee may not loue him either onely or cheefely in regard of them, but principally because he is that Soueraigne goodnesse worthy of all our loue, though he should neuer do vs good; as godly persons are loued of vs, albeit we neither presently haue, not hope for any benefit from them.</p>
                     <p>This pure loue and vnfeigned, it is engendred from<note place="margin">Whence our loue to God springeth.</note> the sense of Gods loue towards vs; whence ariseth in our hearts a loue towards him: as it is written, <hi>We loue him, because he first loued vs,</hi> 1 Iohn 4, ver. 19. Thus it is saide of the woman, Luke 7, 47. that <hi>because many sins were forginen, therefore she loued much.</hi> Thus it is when the loue of God is manifested vnto vs in the forgiuenes of all our sins, and so in our reconciliation with God by Christ, this loue constraines vs to loue God ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5, 14.</note> Because he hath so loued vs, as to giue his Son for
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:3215:151"/>
vs, we are moued, and that most iustly to loue this most louing and mercifull God. And this is it which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that <hi>Faith worketh by loue; Galat.</hi> 5. 6. For after that once we beleeue the promise of grace, and by faith haue laide hold on Gods mercies offered in Christ; this faith sets on worke our loue to God-ward first, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards such as God would haue vs loue, euen to our enemies. And this is the proper effect of our<note place="margin">What be the effects and signes of our loue to God.</note> loue towards God, namely, that it bringeth forth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loue, wherewith we loue, and be ready to do good to all men, especially his Children: it being so, that we cannot loue him which begetteth, but wee must needs <hi>loue them which are begotten;</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 1. For as it must needs follow of Gods loue to vs, that it stirre vs vp to loue him, so it is necessary that our loue wherewith we loue him, doe cause vs to loue all that beare his Image; especially such as beare it by regeneration: Insomuch, that if any man say; <hi>He loueth God, and yet hateth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, surely that man is a lyar, and hath no truth in him;</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. And this loue of others, is such a fruite and effect of our loue to God, as it is a speciall token where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to iudge of the truth and sincerity of it. Whosoeuer then loueth other men, namely, such as are Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in this respect as they belong vnto God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he commandeth loue towards them; I say who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer vpon these grounds vnfeinedly loues his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, (friend, or enemy,) this is an euidence of a man truly louing God: for he that saide, <hi>That hee cannot loue God whom he seeth not, who loueth not his Neighbor whom he doth see;</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 20. hath also saide; <hi>If we loue one another, his loue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <note place="margin">Acts 14.</note> also in <hi>Iohn</hi> 2: in <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and others, who<note place="margin">They rent their cloathes, &amp;c.</note> haue beene moued in Gods cause as in their owne; and more taking to heart things which hapned either with, or against Gods name, then their owne; a true note of true loue. This is also a property of loue, willingly to praise whom wee heartily loue; as hatred appeares by discouering faults and fraileties, and vpbraiding in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfull sort, such as offend with their infirmities: so loue delights to lay open and commend the perfection of that which is loued. This is to be seene in mariage loue, and in the loue of friends; so it is also in Christian loue: it stirreth vp to the searching out and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:3215:153"/>
of the excellencies of God. <hi>I will loue thee dearely O Lord my strength</hi> (saith <hi>Dauid</hi>) <hi>the Lord is my rocke, my fortresse, and he that deliuereth me; Psal. 18, 1. Dauids</hi> loue which he bare to God in his heart, filled his mouth and his Pen too with the praises of his God. Whereof also there is an example in the Spouse of Christ, in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> 5. 10. <hi>My beloued</hi> (saith he) <hi>is white and ruddy, the fairest of ten thousand; shee loued much, and therefore shee praised much.</hi> Adde vnto all this, that loue doth not onely mention with ioy &amp; gladnesse the praises of God; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> but (as we vse to say, shew me your loue by your gifts)<note place="margin">Amor, sui diffusivus.</note> it is content to be at cost with God, and to bestow gifts for his sake: for Gods Children out of their loue vnto God, they doe first giue themselues vnto God, euen their soules and bodies, to doe him seruice in practise of all duties commanded. Euen as the Israelites brought their sacrifices freely, to offer them vnto God vnder the Law; so the faithfull willingly offer themselues <hi>a liuing sacrifice vnder the Gospel; Rom.</hi> 12. 1, 2. They giue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so their graces, and set them on worke towards him, and their brethren; as they receiue of God whatsoeuer gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they haue, so they doe returne them vnto him, to honour him, and serue their brethren with them. The hypocrite as he loues God for his benefits, and so long as hee doth bestow good things on him; but let God once take away his blessings, the cause of his loue, and then his loue faileth him; his blessings and the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites loue liue and die together: so the gifts and graces which the hypocrite hath, are referred not vnto God, to glorifie him therewith; but to the pleasing, profiting, and praysing of themselues, as their owne conscience will tell them, if they will hearken vnto it, and beleeue
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:3215:154"/>
the testimony thereof. It is otherwise with the godly, who in the vse of their gifts seeke not themselues, but God, whom they loue; and vpon whom they are ready to bestow not themselues alone, and their graces, but their goods too: which albeit God hath no need of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>gold is his, and siluer is his; Hag.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. Yet when we giue forth his goods to the maintenance of his worship, or the place of his worship, or the Ministers of his Word, or to the reliefe of others the Saints &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ, then we doe honour the Lord with our substance, and doe giue it vnto himselfe: As he will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly acknowledge at the last day; <hi>What ye did to one of these, ye did it to me: Mathew</hi> 25. <hi>Martha</hi> loued Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. and the woman spoken of, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 37. Also, the women mentioned, <hi>Luke</hi> the 8. 23. and all they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their loue to him by their charges and cost, which they put themselues to for his sake. That we cannot doe to him in his person as they did (because he is gone to Heauen, and hath now no need) we are to doe it to him in his seruants and people; which is taken as a fruite of our loue to himselfe. And as our cost about him, so our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> labour and paines for him doth speake forth our loue: for true sincere loue is diligent, and sticketh at no paines to please or pleasure the party loued. What labour did not Christ endure, that he might expresse his loue to his Church? and what paines ought we to beare, to expresse our loue towards him? Such as loue riches, or pleasures, or honours, it is a wonder to see how exceeding great their paines be to compasse them. And such as truly loue God, as they loue nothing aboue him, so their paines which they take to glorifie him in the inward mortification of sinfull lusts, and the outward perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:3215:154"/>
of all outward obseruations, doth farre surpasse the paines which they take in all other things of their owne. The indefatigable and intollerable labour and toyle of body &amp; mind which Christ did vndergoe, and which <hi>Paul</hi> also did endure, about the redeeming, and instructing of the Church; the incredible paines which in prayer, and preaching, and liuing well, both <note place="margin">Iames is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to haue made his knees hard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>Iames,</hi> and the rest of the Apostles haue suffered; it clecrely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrateth, that the loue of God and his Church is painfull and laborious. There is nothing so hard which loue will not ouercome; all paines to it seeme pleasure and pastime. As they then which sticke at their paines, and with-draw their hand from labour in the things which concerne Gods glory, and their owne eternall good, doe sufficiently tell vs how little and poore their loue is: so the great and constant paines, which neither of vaine-glory, nor of any corrupt respect, but in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse of heart Gods Children put themselues vnto, that they may execute the will of God in their callings; is their acquittance and testimoniall of the great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of their loue to God-ward. Finally, they make it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> appeare yet more thorowly herein, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing greeueth them so much, as the want of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and fauour, if at any time he with draw his louing countenance from them. It is not the losse of any worldly thing, how precious or commodious soeuer, doth afflict them so much with heauinesse, as the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of God conceiued against them for sinne. King <hi>Dauid</hi> banished by <hi>Absolon,</hi> wept bitterly, not so much<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.</note> for losse of his Kingdome, as for Gods anger against him. Whereas such as doe but onely pretend to loue God, they doe not chiefly ioy in his fauour, but in their

                     <p>Many euill men which liue in the Church<note place="margin">The feare of God, how it belongs to the wicked.</note> vnder a standing Ministery, doe attaine by the power thereof vnto a shadow of Sanctification, such as shall worke a certaine reformation in them, but a sleight and light one, not sound and thorow, such as seasoneth and changeth the heart; and vnto a resemblance of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, so as they doe many workes of repenting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, they haue a certaine greefe and seare of sinne, they in a sort humble themselues, confesse their sinnes, leaue many sinnes touching the outward act and worke: but neuer come to purpose in their heart to endeauour an vtter forsaking of all and euery sinne, with a true hatred and loathing of sinne, as it is the offence of a good and righteous God; and they doe many workes, which for the matter and substance of the worke done, are good, but yet they are not done in a good manner, and to a good end, out of a heart purged by faith, respecting Gods glory: so they haue a shew of loue to God, and of fearing God. Howbeit, they are but counterfets in all, and namely in their loue, which is not of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but of his good things, where with their loue doth arise and fall. They are likewise hypocrites in their feare, which is seruile onely in regard of Gods power, and strict iustice; and of that punishment which his powerfull iustice hath either threatned, or already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon them. Their feare is not towards God for
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:3215:156"/>
his mercies, and because hee is vnto them a gracious God and Father; but because hee is righteous, armed with might to hurt and plague them: as the Apostle speaketh of circumcision of the Israelites, and of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> seede, there is not one kind of these; so it is of the feare of God; it is not single and of one kind, but it is diuers. There is an Israelite, and an Israelite; one in heart, another according to the flesh: a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision<note place="margin">Rom. 2, verse last.</note> inward and in truth, another after the letter, and outward in the flesh. So there is a feare, and a feare; a<note place="margin">Feare of God, twofold.</note> good feare, which wee are exhorted vnto, and an euill feare which we are called from. <hi>Feare not</hi> (saith <hi>Moses</hi>)<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>for God is come to proue you, that his feare may be in you, that ye sinne not; Exod.</hi> 20. 20. See in this one short sentence, that they are bid not to feare, and yet char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to haue Gods feare in them: for there is a feare sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish<note place="margin">1. A seruile feare; of this feare it is true which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly saide;</note> and seruile, arising out of the gultinesse of sinnes, and strengthened with dread of punishment from the righteous power of God. This feare correcteth not<note place="margin">Whom wee feare, we hate, and wish they were not.</note> sinne inwardly, it may well bridle some sinne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine from the externall worke of sinne; but it doth not at all reforme the sinner inwardly, who is the more driuen from God by it; and we are dehorted from such a feare. And there is another feare which is filiall and<note place="margin">2. Filial feare.</note> child-like, which proceedeth from Gods mercies in Christ, and bringeth sinners neerer in heart and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to God, holding them closer to him in all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full respects, not to offend him, but in all things to obey and please him. This difference of feare may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by this comparison: There doth at one time<note place="margin">Simile.</note> stand in the presence of a Iudge his owne sonne, and a male factor; the one loth to misbehaue himselfe in his
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:3215:157"/>
fathers presence, for the loue and reuerence hee hath towards him, whom he hath alwayes found a benigne tender father to him; the malefactor for beareth also all lewd and disordered actions, in feare of the Iudges po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, which he doth hate, and of the sentence of death, which he abhorreth. So it is here; euill men being in Gods presence, are restrained and kept from many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, but it is through dread of his reuenging hand; as<note place="margin">Simile.</note> seruants are brought to doe well through dread of the whip: whereas the godly, howsoeuer the infinite po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and iustice of God be dreadfull to them, and they often meditate of his fearefull iudgements against sin, to enure their hearts the more to awe and trembling, (their flesh or old man hauing great need of such ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to bridle them) yet it is the sweete mercies of God in the forgiuenesse ofso many sinnes, and calling them to so great glory, which worketh in them a reuerent regard of Gods will, not to transgresse it; no child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so loth to displease his most kind father, as the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are to displease their louing Redeemer. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they doe endeauour to set themselues (as it were) in the presence of God, considering that his eye which is the Iudge of the World and their heauenly Father, is euer vpon them; and in this consideration they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to carry themselues as becommeth them, who are euer before the face of such a Maiesty, abandoning that which is contrary to his Word, and may prouoke him; and carefully doing such duties as are liking and gratefull to him. This is the ingenuous feare of Gods Children, which bringeth forth these effects in them: first, it restraines them from sinne, euen as touching the inward affection, as it did <hi>Ioseph</hi> from incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:3215:157"/>
the Israelites Midwiues from cruelty, <hi>

                        </hi> from exaction and oppression of the people; yea, it hoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth backe from all sinnes, great and little, secret, as well as open, and that because they are sinnes and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of God: whereas the feare of the wicked keepes him from grosse and open, but not from small and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate sinnes, and that for the paine onely, and not for conscience to God. Secondly, it constraines them to doe good things commanded, out of a care to please God. When <hi>Abraham</hi> offered his Sonne, that which moued him, was this; for that <hi>he feared God; Gen.</hi> 22. 12, <hi>Iob</hi> was a righteous man, and did iust things; for he was a man <hi>fearing God; Iob</hi> 1. 1. Thirdly, it seasons the worship of God, that is to say, the seruice of God: <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>I will draw neere to thy Temple in feare, &amp;c.</hi> Insomuch as often the whole worship of God is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by signified, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 10. <hi>In euery Nation, he that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth God, &amp;c.</hi> Fourthly, it seasons our loue to God, as in a Subiect that loueth his Prince for his excellent good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and bounty, his loue towards his Soueraigne is beautified by a reuerence of his Princes Maiesty: so it is here. Fiftly, it driueth away security, it awakes sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, and makes watchfull. And lastly, it beates downe pride, and high mindednesse; as it is written: <hi>Be not high minded, but feare; Rom.</hi> 11. 20. These seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fruits and effects of the feare of God, are so many perswasions to moue vs to embrace it, whereunto wee are prouoked by other reasons also; as namely because God hath so streightly and often commanded it: <hi>Feare God;</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 17. Againe, <hi>Feare him that can kill body and soule; Luke</hi> 12. which doth shew it to be a thing pleasing to him. Also, it is a gift of God, yea, one of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:3215:158"/>
his speciall and peculiar gifts, which hee vouchsafeth vnto his Children; into whom he hath promised so to put his feare, as <hi>they shall neuer depart from him; Ier.</hi> 32. Moreouer, the feare of God is a mans best wisedome: As it is written; <hi>The feare of God is the beginning of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi> it hath great promises euen of blessednesse made to it; <hi>Blessed is the man that feareth God.</hi> It is the garden<note place="margin">Psal. 112. 1.</note> of all vertues, which are preserued by an ho'y feare of<note place="margin">Prou. 26. 27.</note> God; it is the enemy of all vices, which cannot raigne<note place="margin">Prou. 8. 13.</note> where the feare of God hath place. Besides, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the godly, and the approbation of the feare of God in them by the holy Ghost in Scripture, should greatly excite vs to it. <hi>Cornelius</hi> is commended for this, that he was a man that <hi>feared God, and all his houshold; Acts</hi> 10. 1. Also <hi>Iob,</hi> that hee was <hi>a man fearing God;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Of Ezra, it is said hee feared God greatly.</note> 
                        <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 1. Of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> it is saide, that he <hi>made the feare of God his treasure; Esay</hi> 33. 6. Also <hi>Obediah, Ioseph, Daniel,</hi> and others highly praised in this respect. As on the other side, it is laide downe as a marke of a wicked man, not to feare God; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. And as the want of it hath beene the cause that wicked men haue quite fallen away from God, as in <hi>Pilate,</hi> who feared not God, but <hi>Caesar,</hi> and he slew himselfe; the like is to beseene in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophell</hi> and <hi>Iudas:</hi> so the weaknesse of it in Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, hath beene occasion of sundry falles, as of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> abiuring, through too much feare of man, and too little feare of God; and in <hi>Dauid</hi> counterfeiting himselfe to be an Ideot, or mad, through feare of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis,</hi> King of the Philistians, and sundry others, which out of little feare of God, and too much feare of man, haue done euils, or denied the truth. Therefore (Gods Children) are to labour not onely for sound feare, but
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:3215:158"/>
for a great portion of it, to haue it, and to haue it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, as that it may preuaile ouer the feare of the flesh, to feare God as he should be feared, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the greatnesse of his Maiesty and power.</p>

much for vs? of whom also we looke for so much; from whom commeth all good: without whom nothing can be had that is helpefull and healthfull vnto vs; hee gouerning and disposing all things as he will, hauing all creatures subiect to his will and pleasure: Angels, Men, Diuels, Beasts, to make them friends, or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

But now Sir, I would heare you proue vnto me, that to trust in God, is such a worke as the faithfull alone can doe it; and wherein it consisteth, and how it differeth from the confidence of wicked men, and what be the effects and markes of it in those that haue it, and how we are to be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged vnto it.</p>

                     <p>Of all other workes which be proper to<note place="margin">Trust in God, proper to the faithfull.</note> the Elect, there is least question of this, whether it be appropriated to godly men alone; because the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture euery where doth describe the wicked hereby, as by an essentiall effectuall note, that they trust not in God; that there is in them an euill heart and vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing;<note place="margin">Heb. 3.</note> that they with-draw themselues through vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> that they are full of vnbeleefe; that they are faithlesse, that their trust is in their riches, or in the<note place="margin">Psal. 53.</note> arme of flesh, or in man, and not in the liuing God.<note place="margin">Tim. 1. 6.</note> Which plainely proueth, that none saue the godly man can put his trust in God; it being put downe as the property and vnseparable marke to a righteous man, that his trust is in God, that hee maketh God his<note place="margin">Psal. 18.</note> buckler, his tower, his shield, and defence, his fortresse<note place="margin">Psal. 112.</note>

and bulwarke; that his heart is fixed in God, and stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on him. The promises also which be made to them that they shall neuer be remoued; <hi>Psalme</hi> 125. 1. but be established and stand like mount Sion that cannot be remoued; that mercies shall compasse them on euery<note place="margin">Psal. 32.</note> side, that they shall not perish; that God will be their God for euer, that his saluation belongeth to them, that he will neuer faile nor forsake them; <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. And many such like, do confirme to vs, that to trust in God, as it is a thing maruellous acceptable vnto God, so it is a duty which euery one cannot performe, but they onely with whom God hath stricken an euerlasting couenant.</p>
                     <p>This trust in God, causeth the godly man to repose<note place="margin">What it is to trust in God.</note> and place his affiance and confidence in God, that through his onely goodnesse and power, he shall not onely be safe against all enemies and euils, so as not to be ouercome by them, though he be assaulted; but to obtaine whatsoeuer good thing is expedient for him to haue. The ground of this their confidence, it is first<note place="margin">Ground of trust in God.</note> the knowledge of Gods nature, that he is mercifull, most true, and almighty. Secondly, the consideration of his promises, whereby he hath bound himselfe to doe his children good, and to keepe euill from them. Thirdly, the great experience of Gods great care and kindnesse, both to others and toward themselues. For the first ground of our trust in God; see <hi>Psal.</hi> 146. 5, 6. where the infinite power of God vttered in the worke of creation, and his fidelity in performing his word, are put for foundations of our trust. For the second, when <hi>Esau</hi> came against <hi>Iacob,</hi> hee gathered trust and heart from the remembrance and meditation of Gods
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:3215:160"/>
promises before made to him; <hi>O Lord</hi> (saith <hi>Iacob) thou speakest to thy seruant, and badst me goe into my Country, and thou wouldst be with me; Gen.</hi> 32. 9. Also <hi>Dauid</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon built his confidence, as we may reade <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. <hi>In thy Word is my trust and comfort.</hi> And touching the third, his owne experience of Gods wonderfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation towards himselfe; <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 4. <hi>Thou art the God of my saluation, in thee doe I trust all the day long;</hi> and towards others, <hi>Our Fathers trusted in thee, and were deliuered; Psal.</hi> 22. 4. did embolden him to rest himselfe in God. And this is to bee obserued in the<note place="margin">The godly vse meanes, but haue their trust in God onely.</note> trust and confidence of a godly man, that whether he haue few or many, little or great meanes, any or no meanes; yet his heart still trusteth in God, whom hee knoweth, and hath tried to be sufficient of himselfe, without, nay, against meanes to succour and saue him. And herein is the maine difference betweene the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Wherein the trust of the godly differs from the trust of the wicked.</note> and the wicked, in this point; that whereas both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse to trust in God alone, and in prosperity &amp; peace, both seeme so to doe; yet the trust of the vngodly, is not in the Lord, but in second causes, in outward meanes; as <hi>Asa</hi> trusted in his Phisicians, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 16. 12. The rich man in the Gospell trusted in his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of goods; <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 19. <hi>Doeg</hi> in the multitude of his riches, <hi>Psalme</hi> 53. 5, 6. the Iewes in the AEgyptians, in whom they strengthened themselues; <hi>Esay</hi> 30. 2. the Assirians in their owne forces, <hi>Esay</hi> 36. and some (saith the Psalmist) <hi>trust in Chariots, some in Horses,</hi> whereas the godly doe <hi>trust in the name of the Lord; Psal.</hi> 20. This difference is manifested in the euill day, when meanes faile the wicked; then it appeares their hope was not in God: for of confident and bold, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:3215:160"/>
of the meanes, they weigh faint and heartlesse thorow the absence thereof; as appeareth by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience. Whereas the godly, in desperate hopelesse cases, as <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Den of Lyons, the three seruants in the fiery Furnace, <hi>Ieremy</hi> in the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, <hi>Ioseph</hi> in prison, <hi>Ionas</hi> in the Whales belly, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> in exile and flight from <hi>Saul;</hi> finally, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in the stocks, made God their strength and whole trust: and which is yet more then all this, the godly make the Lord their stay and trust, not onely when all men, and all things bee against them, but allso when God sheweth himselfe as an enimie vnto them, beleeuing in him vnder hope aboue hope; as it is said of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Rom.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Iob</hi> also professing that hee would <hi>trust in God, though he would kill him, Iob</hi> 13. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hereof is euident, because they are assured, that whatsoeuer courses God holdeth towards them, yet his mercies, truth, and goodnesse, are firme, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, and will neuer faile them. Now herein is the triall of our trust in God, when in time of peace<note place="margin">Markes for triall of our trust in God.</note> and prosperity that wee haue meanes at hand, and in our power, wee so vse them, as our minds doth looke beyond them vnto God, looking for the good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, and for a blessing from Heauen; being assured, that as we haue all meanes, so we expect the good vse of the meanes from him alone: and when they are lacking to vs, or fight against vs, yet not to be so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide, but that we still cast vp our eye vnto God, with confidence of helpe from his goodnesse. When wee are put in the clests, and come to any great straites, we are then to resolue and say with <hi>Iehosaphat;</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>There is a great multitude come out against vs, and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:3215:161"/>
wee know not what to doe, but our eyes are towards thee:</hi> and with <hi>Abraham, My sonne, God will prouide a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiee,</hi> when he saw no likelihood of any; <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. and with King <hi>Dauid, Though my heart be per plexed and troubled, yet will I waite on God, he is my helpe and my God; Psa.</hi> 42.<note place="margin">Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to trust in God.</note> And againe, <hi>He hath beene my God euen from my mothers wombe, therefore I will trust in him, Ps.</hi> 22. and <hi>Happy is the man that hath his trust in the God of Iacob; for whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer trusteth in him shall be assured, neuer any yet ashamed which put their trust in the Almighty; Psal.</hi> 22. 4, 5. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou dwell in the secret of the most highest, and abide in the shadow of the Almighty, saying to him, <hi>O Lord, thou art my hope and my rock, my God, in thee will I trust;</hi> surely then he will deliuer thee from the snare of the Hunter, and from the noysome pestilence, hee will couer thee vnder his wings, and thou shalt be safe vnder his feathers; his truth shall bee thy shield and buckler, thou shalt not be afraide of the feare of the night, nor of the arrow that flyeth by day, nor of the plague that destroyeth at noone day, nor of the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which walkes in the darke. Thus great is the peace, and wonderfull is the security and quiet of the man that maketh God his stay: for who can take out of the hands of God? If God will saue, who can destroy? Who can hurt, whom hee will keepe? which doth all what hee will in Heauen and Earth, whom none can resist; whereas God being neglected and set apart, all other things are too weake to helpe. Vaine is the helpe of man; an Horse cannot saue; no power, no policy, can releeue or rescue against God. Vaine is the helpe of Princes; Castles, Towers, Forts, Forces, Friends, wealth, wit, and whatsoeuer else, is vnable to preserue

Both Scripture, and other Stories, abundantly teach of very great and mighty men, how feurefully they haue liued, and how lamentably they haue perished, because they reposed themselues vpon other things besides God: which is sufficient to admonish all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to vse all good helpes giuen them of God, so as their trust be fixed in God alone; for he is the defence of his people, and their strong deliucrer.

The Pharisie both prayed and gaue thankes, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. so did <hi>Iudas,</hi> as well as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Cain,</hi> as well as <hi>Abel.</hi>

                     <p>It is true which you say, that therefore<note place="margin">Of Prayer and thankfulnesse.</note> Christians doe lift vp their mindes vnto God, euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">2 Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> of that trust which they put in him. Hence it is, that they are bold to come vnto God, for that they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly trust that he will doe them good. As we neuer haue an heart to seeke to any men for helpe, in whom wee haue no affiance that they will regard vs; but wee readily get vs to such for kindnesse, of whom we haue some good hope: so it is with Gods Children, their confidence which they haue in God, breedes in them a willingnesse by prayer to craue his helpe; whereof when they are made partakers, they burst out into thankfulnesse and prayses of that goodnesse which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected and releeued them; it being the property of Gods children not to be more forward to desire Gods benefits and protections for them and theirs, ouer their soules and bodies, then to returne thankfull acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements after they haue receiued mercies. And whereas hypocrites and euill men doe pray and giue thankes, it is true generally, that there is no worke tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the outward act, which Gods Children doe, but the Children of this World doe the same; but that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:3215:162"/>
which these doe in hypocrisie, the other doe in truth: and particularly there bee in these workes of prayer<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene good and bad, in Prayer and thanksgiuing.</note> and thankfulnesse, many differences betweene the one and the other; as that the wicked are more ready to beg in their wants, then to be thankefull when they haue sped, and they are thankfull rather for prosperity, then for aduersity: whereas the godly see great cause to giue God thankes and praise in and for euery estate, because all things are made <hi>to worke together for the best towards them; Rom.</hi> 8. Againe, the wicked doe quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> faint in prayer, if they be not heard; whereas the godly perseuere in asking till they be heard: like the woman which followed the Iudge with importunity; <hi>Luke</hi> 18<hi>:</hi> and the man which in the night time got his friend to arise out of his bed, to fetch him a loafe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh his friends which came to him; so Gods children howsoeuer they are long delayed for triall of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and constancy in prayer, and to sharpen their affections, and for sundry other good regards; yet they pray, and ceasse not till God doe send a gracious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: their prayers being like messengers, which will not returne without their answer, or like <hi>Ionathans</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, which brought <hi>Dauid</hi> to him. Moreouer, the wicked pray coldly and out of a custome, the children <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of God pray with care and conscience, and doing their duty with feare of displeasing God. The wicked pray generally, the godly aske particular graces, more beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> sauing graces then others. Whereas euill men aske temporall things more often, and more earnestly; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> neither doe they aske these out of faith, to be heard. Againe, the godly take no worke in hand, but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> it with prayer, and end it with thankesgiuing: so<note place="margin">Col. 3. 17.</note>
                        <pb n="300" facs="tcp:3215:163"/>
doe not the wicked. Moreeuer, the godly doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> pray, with an earnest desire of the thing asked in prayer, and with a sure perswasion of obtaining it;<note place="margin">Marke 9.</note> both which the wicked want. Finally, besides many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> other things, this is one maine difference, that the godly in their prayers and thankesgiuing, performe these workes in respect of, and with a loue to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement which enioynes them, and in a true and vnfeined desire of glorifying God, by their obedience to his will: and herein are Gods Children vnlike the wicked, as in these, so in all other workes which they doe, being good, or leaue vndone being euill; that therein they consent to the law of God in their minds<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 16.</note> and wils, approuing the good they doe, and hating the euill which they flye, and may not doe; studying and endeauouring by such their submission to Gods Law, to set forth and extoll the name and honour of their<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note> heauenly Father. These are the rules they walke by,<note place="margin">1 cor. 10. 31.</note> both in prayer and prayses, in reading and hearing the Word, and in receiuing the Sacraments; as also in the practise of all other duties towards God or men.</p>

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:3215:164"/>
their publike seruice in faith and godly reuerence, with singlenesse of heart, as in Gods presence, and before his face. Secondly, in the time of those solemne acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, remembring themselues to be vnder the eye of God, occupied in his seruice, and about their owne sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, they demeane themselues accordingly, being full of most holy and heauenly motions, sutable to that worke they haue in hand. Lastly, after their being in the Assemblies, they labour to reape great fruite by the vse of the meanes for the encrease of their faith and obedience; that as they bring with them vnto the Ministery of the Word an honest and good heart, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Luke 11. 15.</note> &amp; fully resolued according to the measure of grace receiued to beleeue and obey God, hungring and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 6.</note> after his graces offered, and louing his Word and Sacraments as his blessed Ordinances, and their owne soules nourishment: so after the participation of the Word and mysteries, they perceiue and feele by experience their strength against sinne and Sathan much encreased, and their soules refreshed somewhat in all the graces of the new man, euen as the strength and powers of their bodies are cheered and reuiued<note place="margin">Simile.</note> after a moderate wholsome bodily repast.

Thus it is ordinarily with Gods Children, when they

Repentance is busied about sinnes, and the vse of it, to greeue after any sinne, with a purpose to offend so no more. Temperance gouernes our mind about pleasures of life; meckenesse about in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries from men. Mercy is exercised about miseries of others. Humility bridles the mind about praises and honours. And to be short, the power of moderating the heart in crosses and afflictions which are put vpon vs by Gods appointment, doth belong to Patience, which hath afflictions or aduersities for his proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: for this is the will of God, that no man should liue in this World without crosses and afflictions. Our dayes are few, they are also euill, and very euill. Our yeeres are few, but miseries are not few; they are many and manifold, and some of them great, and doe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually follow vs as the shadow doth the body. These miseries when they happen, they stirre and moue the

mind to griefe; euen as presence of pleasure &amp; delights tickle the mind with ioy, to sorrow assaults the mind in the presence of afflictiue and heauy things, wherewith it should be ouerturned were it not for the helpe of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, which doth temper our griefe, and stay the mind steddy and quiet in good contentment vnder the hand of God.

Our entrance into the World is with danger &amp; cryes, our passage out of the World is by fearefull &amp; painfull death: the middle between birth and death, cradle and graue, is full of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and vexation, affliction being a cup which all men are to drinke of, some more, some lesse, God measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto each person a portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of trouble, as drinke was wont to be measured in cups, that each in the Family might haue a portion. Hence are those speeches in Scripture, <hi>The Lord hath a Cup in his hand; Psal.</hi> 75. 5. And <hi>Father, let this Cup passe; Mat.</hi> 26. 42. And <hi>Can ye drinke of the Cup, &amp;c.

But in this common condition of all men, the wisedome of God doth hold a difference, afflicting his owne children both more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and more seuerely then he doth the children of the World. There are sundry good reasons of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell herein, why he administreth a deepe portion of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and keepeth his Children in the Schoole of tribulations longer then he doth the wicked; first in that God freeth the wicked here, when he doth afflict the iust, it would admonish vs, that there is another World after this, in which his afflicted children shall haue rest and be comforted, when the wanton world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling fatted with delights, shall be troubled and in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as <hi>Abraham</hi> saide to the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. <hi>In his Life time hee had receiued, &amp;c.</hi> And according to that 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 6, 7. There be other reasons of this procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as that he may by his patience &amp; bounty towards the vngodly, call them to amendment, and leaue them without excuse, if they continue impenitent after such

lenity and kindnesse; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. And also to terrifie them and make them afraide to sinne, by expectation of the wrath to come: <hi>For if iudgement begins at Gods House, and the righteous searcely be saued,</hi> they may easily collect what remaines for them, if they turne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 17. Moreouer, Gods owne children by such seuerity vpon them, and lenity to the euill, may perceiue how vnpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall God is, that will not beare with sinne, no, not in his chosen ones; and so learne to feare him; and withall they are encouraged to looke for a better portion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, euen a share in that heauenly inheritance. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as earthly Fathers, though they allow their sonnes bare and course fare and lodging, and hard v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage otherwise, when they who be strangers, are liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained, yet meane them the inheritance: so God plentifully feedeth and furnisheth the wicked, who are strangers from God, when such as be his owne children are both beaten and haue short allowance, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of Heauen is appointed for them. And this is one chiefe ground of patience, that God is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Authour of the afflictions which he sendeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his wil, but disposeth them to their aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the end. Which proceedeth from hence, that howsoeuer God be angry with the sinnes of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and afflict them with greeuous &amp; smartful things; yet they come from a loue and mercy which God bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to their persons, which causeth him in that wrath against their offences, to remember mercy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Contrariwise, in his afflicting of euill men, he hateth both sinne and person for the sinnes sake; which is the reason, that as they haue no true patience vnder the weight of their afflictions and miseries, as not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:3215:169"/>
them to be sent to them out of any good will towards them; so when the burthen is off from their backe, they are neuer the better, they hauing no bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with their affliction to cause them to profit to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, but are rather driuen the further from God: So turning and yeelding to him while his hand keepeth them downe, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> did; yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they returne to their old byas, and be as they were, or rather more hardened in sinne. When as god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men vnderstanding by their faith, that all crosses is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue out of that loue wherewith God loued them in his Sonne to saluation, they are sure of a fruite by their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions to greater repentance and humiliation; and haue their minds well framed to patience, out of this perlwalion, that the hand that strikes them, is no hating and killing; but a louing and sauing hand. The grounds of patience in all other men, are, not the will of God, or the expectation of a benefit out of the assurance of his fauour: but necessity, because they haue no remedy, and they thinke it better to beare it, then to do worse: These two, either that it will not boote them to resist, or that resistance will but doe them harme; these are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grounds of their patience. But on the other side, the godly haue other ground of their patience in all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; which I will now more distinctly name vnto you. As first, that their affl ctions come not by chance, but are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Thirdly, that they are alwaies iust and righteous, though the reason of them be not alwayes knowne; <hi>Daniel</hi> 9. Fourthly, patience in bearing afflictions, is a duty and seruice pleasing to God; <hi>I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

4. 5. Fiftly, they know their afflictions shall not exceed their strength. Sixtly, that there will be a good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py issue of them at the last; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. Seauenthly, that they haue not onely all other men, but all good men to be companion of their afflictions; <hi>Psalme</hi> 34. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it would be to their great hurt to bee free from afflictions. By these considerations, their mindes are stayed in good quietnesse, that though they are not stockes, but doe feele afflictions; yet the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This it is which is the life and soule of patience; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this is the will of God, that his children should glorifie him, by willingly suffering aduersities, and that Gods loue will draw a blessing out of their afflictions, to the glorisying of themselues in the end; euen as <hi>Sampson</hi> gathered sweet out of the bitter: so Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren<note place="margin">Simile.</note> find a sweete fruite of bitter afflictions; <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 12. 11, 12.</p>

arguments of Gods fauour or hatred, because they doe in common fall to all men in such sort, as the godly are blessed when they are afflicted, and wicked persons are accursed, euen when they prosper. The second thing is, that afflictions falling alike to all, (though more, and more often to the good) yet afflictions to wicked men be a part of Gods curse, and properly punishments; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions to the godly are rather loue tokens, and haue the nature of blessings in them. Thirdly, when good and euill men are vnder afflictions, there is no smal dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in their patience; some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>After these things thus discoursed, it will be sitting that we passe from this generall Treatise of afflictions, and to descend vnto particulars, to speake of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they are either the chastisements of our sinnes, or the trials of our faith and loue; thus I thinke we may distinguish the afflictions of the godly: The Scripture so plainely telleth vs, that <hi>God chastiseth whom he loueth, nurtering and correcting euery childe whom hee receiues; Heb.</hi> 12. 6: and also doth tempt and take triall of them. Thus he is saide to haue tempted <hi>Abraham; Gen.</hi> 22. 1. And afflictions are called temptations; <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 23.

But to fall in hand with the worke, it is true indeed which you say, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, which in themselues, and toward the wicked are a part of the curse due to sinne; yet in respect of the righteous, they change their condition: the afflictions and death of our Lord Iesus Christ hauing sanctified all the afflictions of his members which beleeue in him, that they should put on another nature, and be no more to them an execration; but to serue (as you well say) either for correction or probation, or both. For in one worke sometime God hath a double end, both to chasten for some sinne done, and to take triall of the graces in his children. For our orderly proceeding, I will first entreat of Chastisements, and the patience which Gods Children shew therein: Afterwards of their trials, and namely of their great triall of trials, which is by death and martyrdome; whereunto some of Gods Children are put, and all are to expect it. The Church of God it is a Schoole, the faithfull are as Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:3215:171"/>
and Schollars; in Schollars there is much forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, and slothfulnesse, and much other vntoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; which will neede to be remedied by the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting hand of Christ, the onely master of his Church: his Ministers being to him but as Vshers. The Church is as a Family, the faithfull are as Gods seruants &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;<note place="margin">2 Simile.</note> amongst these there is alwayes some vnrulinesse, and disobedience: therefore God their Lord and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cannot be without roddes for chastisements. This the Scripture abundantly witnesseth, that as the godly on the one side giue plentifull matter, by their often and plentifull sinning, yea, sometimes by greeuous sinning against God, why they should bee beaten euen with scourges: so on the other side, many and manifold are the corrections of God. He hath roddes and scourges of all kindes, gentler and sharper, inward and soule cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements, outward and bodily corrections: God can smite in goods, name, estate, credite, wife, children, friends, liberty, in euery thing that is with them, or neere them, or deere to them. God knowes how to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten them, by taking away, or lessening their comfort; also by putting vpon them things greeuous to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein Gods Children through patience doe shew all good contentment at the Lords dealing with them, though it be sometimes very rough and seuere. Yet they know and consider that it is well deserued,<note place="margin">First ground of patience.</note> they haue made themselues very worthy to be wel bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, by their breach of Gods Law; and it is but good reason, if they be so bold as to transgresse, and deserue chastisement, that God should take leaue to vse his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Therefore as they suffered with patience the Fathers of their bodies when they corrected them, now
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:3215:171"/>
much more they doe submit themselues to him that is the Father of Spirits; especially when they marke his manner of proceeding in his chastisements, and the chiefe ends that he aymeth at in them: seeking therein their profit, not his owne praise, or pleasure, as bodily Parents often doe.

But as earthly Fathers winke at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry and many things amisse in their children; so it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God to vse conniuence and fauour towards our daily infirmities, and smaller faults which accompany the frailty of our nature. Therefore it is saide of him, <hi>that he is slow to anger, patient, and full of compassion and goodnesse, Psal.</hi> 103. Indeed when the godly doe forget themselues, and fall into some foule and grosse sinne, especially whereby they giue offence by their example, prouoking others to sinne; or when in lesser faults they grow too stubborne, and waxe secure, or when they lift vp their hearts, and become proud and high minded; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

not till he haue giuen good warning, either by admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Prophets and seruants, or motions of his owne Spirit, and often checkes of our owne conscience, calling vpon vs to reforme our life. As it is written in <hi>Amos 3. 7. Surely the Lord will doe nothing, but he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale it to his Prophets.</hi> After these warnings by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, if there follow no repentance, then there being no other remedy, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 36. 16, 17, he proceeds to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stising, the more seuerely the longer that he hath borne; and the more that wee haue prouoked him, either by greeuousnesse of the fault, or obstinacy in resisting his holy Spirit, speaking <hi>in the Ministery of his holy Word; Acts</hi> 7. 51. Howbeit, in these chastisements so iustly deserued, so worthily pulled vpon vs, he doth exercise maruellous wise loue, or louing wisedome: his long suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,<note place="margin">4.

He goes to correction with a leaden foote, and when he correcteth and layeth on his heauiest hand on his children yet it is in so wise &amp; louing a manner, with such fitnesle and moderation, to so good purposes, as the faithfull find euen in their smartfull chastisements, cause not onely of patience and great contentment, but of great praise and thankfulnesse; yea, of ioy and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse in their in ward man: howsoeuer their rebellious flesh mutter and storme.

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee discerneth by his wisedome what chastisements be most meete and fittest for euery one; where to vse a gentle, and where an harder hand: when to strike the soule, when to smite the body; when it will be best to correct by losses. Also, he knowes how to proportion the chastisements <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

what fault helis beaten; dealing herein like the skilfull wise Physicion, that doth not minister like potions and medicines to all his Patients, but considereth their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions and the nature of the disease, and the degree of the sicknesse, and accordingly tempereth his physicke: so doth God measure out to euery one such a portion of corrections (which is the sinners physicke) as the strength of euery one may be able to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

As a crabbed stock doth neede a crabbed wedge, and a sturdy vntamed Colt a hard bir; so the obstinacy of some, and the tough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their spirit, needeth a more seuere discipline. Herein moreouer his wisedome declareth it selfe, that as he knowes how to fit the chastisement vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the fault, and quality of offendors; so how to keepe a moderation both for measure and time, neither more correction nor longer then shall be behoueful: as cunning Musicians, who know how to stretch their strings till they be in tune, and no further, least they breake them. Finally, in this also his wisedome is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested, that whereas afflictions in their owne nature be euill, as they are also called; <hi>Amos 3. 6. Lam. 3. Parts of the curse due to sinne:</hi> yet as in the creation hee made light out of darkenesse, so in his wise prouidence hee draweth much good towards his out of these painefull euils: wherein he maketh his great loue, together with his wisedome to be known, not onely in that he striketh not so often as wee deserue, and farre lessethen wee are worthy, his chastisements alwayes comming short of our desert, neither suffers his loue them long to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue; but especially in this, that of short corrections, through his louing blessings vpon them, his children reape hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie

the second is humility, to hide the pride of man; to turn man from his enterprizes, what is it else but to change his euill mind and workes into good?

And as our children let goe without chastising, would proue wantons and rebellious against their gouernours; so would Gods children.

like vnto pampered Horses, which lift the heele to kicke and spurne at their Owner and Master. Euery mans owne experience can teach vs this, that if we be suffered a while without correction, and blessed with ease and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, we grow forgetfull of God, slacke and cold in prayer, and in the whole seruice of God, secure and presumptuous in all our conuersation. But to speake more distinctly of this matter, how chastisements when they are blessed of God, doe much helpe forwards the repentance of the godly; it is found true by testimony and examples in the Word, that some by meanes of correction haue beene brought to the knowledge and sight of some sinne, which they did not espy and know to be in themselues; their correction being as an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salue vnto them, to helpe them clearely to espie that which was hid from their eyes. Thus to <hi>Iosephs</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, afflictions gaue them vnderstanding of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, which they had long before committed against their brother; <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 21, 22. Moreouer, corrections helpe a man as to the knowledge, so to worke the griefe and detestation of his sinne; because in his sharpe and bitter corrections, he perceiueth the better euen by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience what bitter things our sins are, and how much they displease God. See the truth of this in the Israelites, 1 <hi>Sam. 7. 6. Lam. 5. 15, 6:</hi> in <hi>Dauid, Psalme</hi> 38. 17 and in many others. What should I say further, that through the rodde of correction Gods children are led vnto an hearty and earnest confession of their sinnes? also to ear<note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note>

As Christ being tempted, pittied others, and can suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour his members: so Christians by their owne corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which they feele, learne to commiserate others when they are iudged of God.

Yea, God himselfe hath promised to<note place="margin">Esay 57.</note> dwell with the humble, and make the contrite and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heart his temple and habitation: euen he that hath his seate in the highest heauens, will come and rest with him who is of a broken and humble heart.

                     <p>You doe rightly iudge of Chastisements to be blessed workes of Gods loue, whereby such a fruite is purchased to Gods children, as the decrease of their pride, and increase of humility; not onely for the time they liue vnder the rodde (for so long euen <hi>Pharaoh</hi> will be humble, and <hi>Achab</hi> will be humble so long (that is) they will counterfet an humblenesse, till they get out of Gods hands,) but to cause them to walke more humbly with their God, and towards men all their life after: for it is a consideration which sinkes deep into the children of God, when they will bethinke themselues that they are beaten, and by such an one as the great and good God, &amp; deseruedly too for iust causes; yea, and so as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers see their stripes, and take knowledge that God is angry with them; this makes them hang downe their heads, and abate their courage.

eye, by their blowes and strokes, as they learne great patience and thankfulnesse, as well as humility, because they receiue all their chastisements as corrections of a most louing Father, who seeketh in them their best good. But it shall be sufficient to haue entreated thus farre of Chastisements, let vs passe on to the trials of Gods Children.</p>
                     <p>Touching which, we are to know thus much, that in<note place="margin">Of Tiyals.</note> the corrections which God sendeth his Children, hee doth not onely looke at this, onely to admonish them of their sinnes past, that they may turne, and be more obedient for time to come, and to abase the pride of their heart, that they may carry themselues in all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse: but withall, he doth take tryall of the faith, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and loue of his Children, and sometimes it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him to inflict some greeuous iudgement vpon them without any such respect at all as to correct their sinnes, but meerely for probations sake. Thus hee dealt with <hi>Iob,</hi> whole afflictions were not chastisements of his sinnes, but trials of his faith and patience. Of this kind were such aduersities and troubles, as happened to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> whose pilgrimages proued very combersome, and full of crosses.

It stands with very good reason, that God should at his pleasure make triall of men, to see what is in them; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men doe at their pleasure make triall of such things,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:3215:177"/>
and persons, as be in their power; their Horses, their Dogges, their Seruants, their Children. And albeit times of prosperity, are times of tryall; for therein both euill men make proofe of their pride, security, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption; and also the godly declare their modesty, watchfulnesse, and piety: yet times of afflictions are meerest times of tryall; because as on the one side many vices are couered in the dayes of prosperity and peace, which are laide open in the euill day; as selfe-loue, loue of this World, impatiency, vaine confidence, feare, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust, and sundry others, which afflictions bring to light: so on the other side, there be sundry vertues of good men, as their faith, loue, obedience to God, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, feare of God, hope, &amp;c. which be more better seene, and more manifested by afflictions, then out of afflictions. It is an easie thing when men haue rest and riches, to make profession and semblance of faith and piety. Now, that it may be manifested, who doe it in truth, who otherwise, therefore God vseth to send af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions as touch-stones, to try the currant from the counterfet; and as fire, to seuer the drosse from the pure siluer. There is much money lookes as faire as any cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant money, which yet is found to be vicious, when it is brought to the touch to be tryed. Likewise very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there be, who in the dayes of peace haue faces, and appearances of good and faithfull men, who are made knowne in the houre of tribulation to be farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then they seemed to be, the Crosse pluckes the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sard of hypocrisie from their face, and hauing vnmas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them, makes them to shew what they are.

heart and reines. And indeede how should he that made vs, be ignorant of vs? Therefore these trials serue to lay vs open, not to his al-seeing eye, but to ourselues; we being often very ignorant, what is in vs: some sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing they haue great faith, loue, and obedience, when it is but little, as <hi>Peter:</hi> Others fearing their portion of faith to be little, when it is great, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea:</hi> some boasting of much faith, which haue neuer a deale; as the <hi>Laodiceans, Reuel.</hi> 3. Now by the tryall of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all these come to a sight and discerning themselues; As it is written, <hi>I haue tempted thee, to know what was in thy heart; Deuteronomy</hi> 10. 12; that is, it was meete to make thee know what is in thy selfe; whereof it will follow, that such as tooke themselues to be full of grace, as they in <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>We are rich, and full, and need no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> finding themselues poore and empty, either will be driuen to Christ, or left without excuse. Such as find they haue great strength of faith, which thought they had but a small faith; and they also that presumed of more, then by experience they see in themselues; the one shall be prouoked to more thankfulnesse and ioy, the other to more humblenesse and feare; and both to a greater patience, considering the good that comes to them by such tryals. For it is a great mercy of God in the tryall of his children, to enable them to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues better, and to behold more clearely both what they already haue, and what they want; that they may so ioy for the one, as by the other they may be stirred to an holy feare, and earnest prayer for encrease. It is the greatest wisdome to know our selues; and our tryals doe teach vs this wisedome: for which cause they are with all patience to be endured, especially sithence to them
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:3215:178"/>
which are tryed, and doe endure, there is promised, <hi>A Crowne of glory in the life to come; Iames</hi> 1. 12.

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:3215:179"/>
strange and long sicknesses; in all which, they haue for grounds of their patience, the will of God, who allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth these things to them; his promise of turning all things to the best for them, &amp; the example of the Saints which haue beene put to endure the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and also haue been both sustained in them, and well brought through them: but of all the trials, their patience is most proued and approued by their enduring the conflict of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for sinne, and the suffering of mattyrdome for the Golpell. This double tryall for their sharpenesse and fiercenesse, may well be called, the fiery Tryall; when either the conscience within is frighted, and astonished with feare of hell fire for the offence of God by sinne; or the body without is put to abide the flames of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary materiall fire, for the name of Iesus: and sure the former inuisible tryall, is almost vnsupportable. It is wondrous vncomfortable, when the poore conscience hath sinne to surcharge and sting it, Sathan to accuse, the Law to threaten; God also appearing as a bitter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, shewing himselfe in great wrath as a seuere Iudge to condemne; the mercifull promises, and all things else that should breed comfort, with-drawne from the eye of faith, or faith so dimmed and daunted, that it cannot looke vp to Christ. This is indeed a heauy tryall; while a mans spirit is firme and strong, it beares out all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but when the spirit it selfe is wounded, who can beare that? Christ saith, <hi>That if the salt that seasoneth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, haue lost his saltnosse, wherewith</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall it be seasoned?</hi> and if the eye, which is the light of the body, be darke, how great is that darknesse? So may I say of the spirit and heart of a godly man, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth him in all his troubles; if that be dismayed and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:3215:179"/>
wounded, how great is that discomfort? Againe, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afflictions and tryals of Gods people, this is the stay of their minds, and the chief prop of their patience, that though diuels and men be against them, yet God is with them; they see his helpe and aide ready to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and deliuer: but here in this soule-tryal, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe shewes himselfe as an enemy offended for breach of his Law, as armed with wrath, and ready to take vengeance. Thus it was with <hi>Iob</hi> in his tryall, who thought God to be his enemy, complayning that he had written bitter things against him, and that hee had set him as a butte to leuell at, and to shoote his arrowes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst. Thus it fared with holy <hi>Dauid,</hi> and infinite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Saints, who could perceiue in God for the time and fit of their temptation, no other but fury, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and hot displeasure; <hi>Psal.</hi> 6. 72. <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 1, 2. The Children of God neuer vtter their impatiency more then in this case; so farre as they haue proceeded euen to challenge and charge God, breaking forth in their infirmities, into contumelies, censuring him very hardly, as if he were too rigorous and extreme: yet for all this, that their patience is so sore shaken, it is still vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, and made to endure vntill it ouercome at the last. Remember the patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> and what end it had; <hi>Iames</hi> 5, 11. The grounds of their patience in this their deepe tryall, be these: first, the consideration of Gods soueraignty and absolute power ouer all men, whom he may sist at his pleasuee, and glorifie himselfe in vs by what way he will. Secondly, his exceeding great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and truth, which will not suffer him to tempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue our strength, nor to with-hold an happy issue.

Lastly, the examples of others, especially of the Sonne of God, who tasted and drunke of the same Cup, feeling in his soule the sharpe wrath, and wrestling with the strict iustice of his displeased Father, so as in his present sence he had nothing but discomfort.

2. 13. <hi>My faithfull Martyr Antipas was slaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, where Sathan dwelleth.</hi> It is not the manner of God at the first to call his Children to this tryall of Martyrdome, but by certaine degrees, after hee hath tried them with lesser and lighter afflictions, when by long exercise they haue got good strength, and vpon sure tryall of Gods mighty grace in sustaining and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting them, are growne to experience and good hope, it being the wisedome of God to measure tryals accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the strength which men haue: for hee will not tempt, nor try any of his aboue their power; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. As in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> we may perceiue that God did obserue an order in their tryals, and still their last were greatest and weightiest. Thus it was likewise in his proceeding with the Apostles of Christ, after they had beene tryed with mocking and taunts; <hi>Acts</hi> 2. with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment and bands, <hi>Chapter</hi> 4. with scourging and stripes, <hi>Chapter</hi> 5. at length they were called out to the hard and hot tryall of Martyrdome; to teach all men, that whatsoeuer tryals they shall passe, yet still to looke for sharper and more bitter to be behind. Also it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God in his wise dispensation to follow this course towards his Children, that he doth not put vpon them this tryall, but first warneth them of it before it come by his Ministers, calling vpon them to prepare &amp; make ready against the euill day; to take away all excuse from inconstant back sliders, and to stirre vp the godly to arme themselues. And wee are here to remember a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goodnesse of God in this matter, namely, that hee chargeth all the faithfull that they doe set their loue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Christ and his truth, as in respect thereof neither friends, kinsfolke, brethren, and sisters, parents, hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:3215:181"/>
wife, or life it selfe, ought to be so dearely loued, but that when the comparison is betweene these things and Christ with his Gospell, they be ready to manifest that they were lesse loued by their willingnesse to lose and forgoe them all for him. And surely it is a most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable thing, that Iesus Christ being of more worth and excellency, one that is higher then the Heauens, ful of grace and truth, in whom all treasures of wisdome are hid; the <hi>God-head dwelling in him bodily, Colos.</hi> 2. 9. and also hauing loued vs best, and out of his loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs hath done much for vs; in that after many great crosses and calamities of his life, he suffered the extreme paine of a shameful death, giuing his body and soule an offering for our sinnes, and calling vs to the knowledge of himselfe by his Word. Therefore of all things which be deare vnto vs, he should be most deare and best beloued; so it is but equall, our loue towards him should carry vs so farre, that if need be, and God will haue it so, wee should be ready and forward as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in affection, so when time requireth actually to lay downe our liues for his sake. For if we must so loue our euen Christians, our brethren in Christ, as that we be content to lay downe our liues for them; I <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. how much more doe we owe this to our elder brother Christ Iesus, from whom we receiue the spirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If Subiects to please their Prince, or for the honor and safety of their Countrey; Souldiers at the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, land for the loue of their Generall: Finally, if men in their priuate quarrels be willing to hazard their liues, and doe put them in perill: how equall is it that the like be performed by vs for Christ, who is our life, and for his blessed Word of life? Especially seeing it is
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:3215:181"/>
a condition which hath layne vpon the shoulders, not onely of Prophets, Apostles, and other godly men and women in all ages: but such as our Lord himselfe was not exempted from; and let not the seruant looke to be in better condition then the Lord. It is well with the Disciple to be as his Master is; neither is it onely an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall condition, but it is also a blessed condition, Christ hauing pronounced them happy which shall <hi>lose bonse or land, wife or children, or life, for him and his Gospell; Mathew</hi> 19. 29.</p>

                     <p>It is a thing apparant, that there is great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in this condition of denying &amp; leauing our liues for Christ. Had one man a thousand liues, hee owes them all to him, who being Lord of life and glory, was content by giuing his life a ransome for our sinnes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme vs from so great destruction, and by his word to call vs to so great saluation. But now let me heare what you will say to the necessity of this condition, and what is to be done of Christians which will prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues for it, that they may be found ready, if it fal to be their lot.

So it stands euery one vpon, who takes vpon him the profession of Christ, to try his heart, whether hee can be content to prefer Christ aboue all other things, and to be willing, (if neede require) to forgoe euen life it selfe for his sake: for such is the malice of Sathan, and of the wicked his children against Christian Religion, and the true fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and followers thereof, as they doe watch all opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of raysing vp not onely ordinary molestations, but fiery persecutions against them. And againe, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God after times of peace, and long calmes of pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, to send a storme and tempest of persecution and martyrdome, to discouer hypocrites, and to shew who be sound Christians; who follow God for his blessings, and who professe him of loue. Therefore it is necessary that euery one be found ready, and well furnished with faith and patience, to be willing and able to abide the worst. For as in warre when a field is pitched &amp; fought, all the Souldiers that fight are not slaine, yet are they all subiect to the Sword, howsoeuer many escape aliue: so in this warfare against Sathan and the World, all are lyable to this great tryall of martyrdome, though it please God to spare and free many from vndergoing it; yet all by nature and condition of their profession are subiect to it, and are to make reckoning, and so to fit themselues, as if time change (for nothing is more changeable) they may not be to seeke of their weapons. This is it then which I doe determine according to the Word, that forasmuch as all Christians are Christs bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:3215:182"/>
Souldiers, and haue taken the presse money to serue him to the death; <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6. 5, 6, 7: And all ought to be as an house built vpon a rocke firme and constant; <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 24: And <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle prayeth for the beleeuing Christians; <hi>Colos.</hi> 1. that they may be <hi>strengthened to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience:</hi> And also it is written; <hi>That whosoeuer put their hand to the Plough, and looke backe, are vnfit for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen, Luke</hi> 9. 62. And all that will liue godly in Christ, <hi>must suffer persecution;</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 12. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that by <hi>many tribulations we shall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen; Acts</hi> 14. 22. Therefore howsoeuer it may seeme good vnto God, to bring men to their graue in peace, yet to euery Christian there is a necessity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution and preparation for martyrdome. Touching your other demand, what duties are to be done of such as will duly prepare and addresse themselues for such a tryall: As this is a part of our wisedome to forethinke that persecution may arise, and of our piety, to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and willing to embrace it when it comes; so it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther required of all godly wise Christians, to prepare themselues as Marriners against a storme, and to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise themselues as Souldiers against the day of battle. Now the exercise of a Christian to fit himselfe for the tryall of Martyrdome, consisteth in these things: first, to labour for a sound iudgement in matters of faith, that first vpon sound instruction hee beleeue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly the truth of Religion, and so there will follow a franke and vndaunted confession; according to that that is written: <hi>I beleeued, and therefore I spake;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. Whereas the vnsetled and vnseasoned Christian, being either ignorant, or but wauering, wi'l proue <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable in his way; Iames</hi> 1. 8. Secondly, to this must be
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:3215:183"/>
ioyned a through labouring in the mortification of the corrupt lusts of our sinfull nature, and a deniall of our selues; because Scripture teacheth what experience hath confirmed, that such as liue in pleasure &amp; diuers sinnes, lacking the spirit of mortification, being otherwise lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and leading a ciuill life, haue proued back-slyders, and more dishonoured God thereby in one houre, then all their life long they gained him glory. He had not neede immoderately to loue the World, or to hold any sinnes deare to him, that must part from his owne life in Christs quarrell. The mortisied man therefore is the likeliest and fittest man to make a Martyr; such as being engrafted into Christ his death, haue got power to die to sinne, are meetest persons to die for the Gospell of Christ. Vnto all which, there must be added a serious meditation of such Scriptures as foretell of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the name of Christ, and diligent and often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to minde the examples of such as haue valiantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured losse of goods and life for the Lord Iesus; with earnest prayer to God for strength and power to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with like constancy. Such as most suspect their owne strength, and being afraide of their infirmity, get to them all helpes of setled iudgement, mortification, examples, prayers, and Scriptures, to establish their hearts; there is best hope of such that they will sticke to it. Some haue boasted of their strength in a vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence thereof, and haue started away when it came to the proofe: whereas fearefull Christians, which mistru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting their owne sufficiency and strength, did make God their rocke, haue manfully acquitted themselues, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing rather to die, then to denie their Lord that bought them. He that is the greatest bragger at home, is not
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:3215:183"/>
euer the best Souldier in the field; nor he alwayes stands to martyrdome in the euill day, which in dayes of peace is most forward in shew of zeale &amp; profession of words. <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> which at the first came to Iesus by night, being too fearefull; afterwards did declare his loue to Christ, boldly standing to him in a great extreamity, when his owne Disciples, who saide; <hi>They would die with him,</hi> shrunke from him, and forsooke him. He therefore that least presumeth of his owne power, and most stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth against the power of sinne, is best made for such a businesse, as to suffer with Christ.</p>

                     <p>Now Sir, let me entreate you to deliuer to me what may be the considerations whereby it pleaseth God to encourage his children to such a resolution and patience, as when the fiery tryall commeth, they can with constancy hold it out: and how the assaults of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, the world, and the flesh, to shake and weaken this resolution, may be beaten backe, or repelled?</p>

                     <p>It is the holy Spirit of God which doth establish them vnto and in this tryall, inspiring their hearts with wisdome and courage, that they may know how to confesse his truth freely, and boldly; and with godly patience that they may suffer for it manfully. As Christ saide; <hi>It shall be giuen you what to speake in that houre; Mathew</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. 19. And <hi>Dauid</hi> prayes God, <hi>to renew a firme spirit in him, and with his free Spirit to establish him; Psal.</hi> 51. 11, 13. And <hi>Paul</hi> for the <hi>Colossians,</hi> prayeth <hi>God to strengthen them to all patience with ioy fulnesse; Col.</hi> 1. 11. So then the constancy of Martyrs is to be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed not to any natural power, but to the mighty worke of Gods Spirit, who saith vnto the weake, <hi>Be thou strong, and feare not, for I am with thee in fire and water.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit<note place="margin">Esay 43.</note>
                        <pb n="342" facs="tcp:3215:184"/>
there are sundry meete considerations, whereby it pleaseth the holy Ghost to quicken &amp; strengthen their mindes to patient enduring. First of all, that by Gods eternall decree which appointeth them to saluation, they were also appointed to that martyrdome; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29: Those whom he knew before, he predestinated to be made <hi>like</hi> the Image of his Sonne, that is, in suffering as he suffered. Hence ariseth a second consideration, namely, that the Martyrs in suffering death, haue <hi>Iesus</hi> the Sonne of God, not onely their Captaine to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and leade them the way, but their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and partner in their sufferings: for they not onely suffer after his example, but suffer with him, and he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth in them: so as their afflictions are called, <hi>The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of Christ; Colos.</hi> 1. 24. Thirdly, their paine of martyrdome is short and light, the ioyes which follow haue both immortality &amp; weight; the smart and shame which they see, is temporall, but the glory which they see not, <hi>is eternall;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. These light and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany afflictions, <hi>shall bring an immortall weight of glorie,</hi> saith <hi>Paul:</hi> The things you see are temporall, but the things you see not, are eternall. After a bitter break-fast, the Martyrs alwayes and certainly doe looke for a better dinner. They sowe in teares, to reape in ioy; they passe through afflictions to a kingdome: as the Israelites through the red Sea and Wildernesse to <hi>Canaan.</hi> Fourthly, they looke vpon Christ, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour and finisher of their faith; who for the ioy set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, endured the <hi>Crosse, and despised the shame; Heb.</hi> 12. 2. Also they consider the examples of other Martyrs, who haue gone that way of the crosse cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and haue not loued their liues to death for Christ
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:3215:184"/>
and his Word. By which cloud of witnesses they are much moued and perswaded, to <hi>run the race that is set before them with patience; Heb.</hi> 12. 1. Fistly, to suffer for Christ, it is a precious gift; <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 29. For <hi>vnto you it is giuen for Christ, that not onely ye should beleeue in him, but also suffer for his sake.</hi> It is also a thing of such wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, as to be reioyced for; <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 41. <hi>They went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way reioycing.</hi> And it is an honourable and glorious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>If ye be rayled vpon for the name of Christ, blessed are ye, for the Spirit of glory, and of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth vpon you:</hi> for that must needs be precious and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, which maketh them companions, and like vnto the honourable Sonne of God; procureth a blessed and honourable memory in earth amongst men, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth them a way for euerlasting honour in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, great is the profit which Martyrs doe bring, both to the Church, in the example of their constancy, and to themselues, in the exceeding great reward which shall be giuen them; their miserable life being changed for a most blessed life; <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Great is your reward in Heauen.</hi> Seauenthly, the pleasure of Martyrdome: for they that suffer, reioyce in such tribulation, some of them clapping their hands in the middest of the flame, singing Psalmes with chearefulnesse, and some of them professing the fire to be vnto them as a bed of Downe, or of Roses.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, it is a safe thing to die for Christ: for such as here in this World will lose their life for him, shall find and saue it in another world; as on the other side, they that will saue it here, (with euill conditions) shall lose it there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="344" facs="tcp:3215:185"/>Ninthly, in suffering Martyrdome, there is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour, profit, pleasure, and safety; but it is also an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest duty: for we shew our selues thankful to Christ our benefactor. And this is an honest thing, to be gratefull to such as haue done vs good: also it is honesty to sticke to him in persecution and trouble, whom wee haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in peace and prosperity; and finally, to maintaine his cause to death before men, who by his death pleads our cause with God, it is an honest part, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. Now to conclude this point, the Martyrs doe consider, that it is but their bodies which they giue for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Christ, and that they giue them to day which might be taken away to morrow; also, that they giue them for a while, to receiue them againe for euer: they giue weake and vile bodies, to receiue for them glorious bodies, full of power and honour: that it is reason to giue their bodies for his name, who might in iustice require them to punishment. Finally, hauing sinned with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, it is meete they should with the same be willing to glorifie him. And now <hi>Aquila</hi> that ye haue heard the grounds of Patience, in the tryall of Martyrdome, if you will obiect what is vsed by Sathan and the flesh to be laide in for the battering thereof, I will shew you how they are to be repulsed.</p>

                     <p>As all good purposes haue their hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; so this resolution of Martyrdome is diuersly and strongly opposed by friends, our selues, and our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Christs purpose to suffer at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was crost by a friend, his disciple <hi>Peter; Mat.</hi> 16, 22. and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples at <hi>Tyrus, Acts</hi> 21, 4, would haue hindered <hi>Paul</hi> in his purpose that way. Likewise at all times there be found Christian friends ready to say, that our liues may

winne great glory to God, much good to his Church, and therefore it were good to fauour our selues. And surely this counsell is not to be neglected, when we may follow it without disobedience to Gods Word, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to his name, or offence to the Church, or hurt to our owne conscience: otherwise they are to be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as <hi>Peter</hi> was of Christ; <hi>Get thee behind mee Sathan.</hi> What thinke you of it?</p>

                     <p>I could be well content our hands were eased of this labour, for I begin to feele my selfe scarse well; but it wil not be laide out of hand I doubt so soone as you make reckoning of: for with my good will, there shall not be one peculiar grace of Gods Elect, but some thing shall be saide of it. My desire is, as much as lyeth in vs, that this our glasse shall discouer to a Christian all his dignity by his calling; and all his duty (being called) towards his Caller. To proceede therefore in our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, all our duty to man is comprehended in this one word Righteousnesse; as godlinesse compriseth all our duty towards God, whereof as wee find sundry bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, so hath Righteousnesse many members; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>Paul</hi> there rehearseth <hi>loue, ioy, peace, long suffering, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, goodnesse, faith, meeknesse, and temperance:</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,</hi> 3. 12. besides these, there are reckoned vp, <hi>mercy, kindnesse, humblenesse of mind, forbearing, and forgiuing one another.</hi> Also in 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 5. we find there <hi>vertue, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, brotherly kindnesse:</hi> in <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 13. <hi>meekenesse of wisdome;</hi> in <hi>Titus</hi> 2. <hi>grauity and chastity:</hi> in <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. <hi>spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king truth:</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>contenteanesse;</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 19. <hi>modesty.</hi> Vnto all which, wee must adde all respectiue graces and workes which are to be done of vs, in respect of some degree which is put vpon vs; as we be Parents, or Children, Masters or Seruants, Husbands or Wiues, Subiects or Gouernours, &amp;c.

By all which, it is
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:3215:189"/>
manifest, that they be such graces as are proper to the regenerate, and which none but Gods chosen children can haue. The appearance and shadow of them is to be found in others, who (as Apes doe Men) would imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the godly in these vertues, and yet haue them not, because they haue not faith, the roote of them.</p>

                     <p>THe word Righteousnesse, is a large word in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and hath many acceptions. But to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:3215:190"/>
it is either that peculiar vertue, whereby in <note n="*" place="margin">This Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse is commutatiue, and distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and bargaines, and matters of iustice, men are enabled to deale equally and rightly, giuing as good as they take, and rendering to euery one their due; and it is set against wrong by oppression or deceit, as contrary vnto it: or else more generally it is put and vsed to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that same <note n="*" place="margin">This Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse is habitual or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall.</note> worke and grace of the Spirit, in the soule of a regenerate man; whereby hee is willing and ready to respect his Neighbour in euery thing that is deare &amp; precious to him, causing him to take thought and care, not onely not to hurt nor offend any man by thought, word, or deede, (as neere as may be) either in his excellency and dignity, or in his life, in his soule, or body, in his goods or credit, or any thing else whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer belongeth vnto him: but in all and euery one of these, louingly to tender him with an vnfained desire, and labour by all good meanes, and with his best might to encrease and preserue all and euery one of them. As vnrighteousnesse in the phrase of Scripture compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all those vices, whereby men are hurtfull to men, in any of their good things: so vnder Righteousnesse are comprehended all vertues, whereby wee become a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way, or in any sort profitable and helpefull to our Neighbour. In this sense is the word Righteousnesse taken, in all those places where it is set with holinesse or godlinesse; as <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 12. &amp; <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse set beside vngodlinesse, or set alone, is the spring of all euils from one man to another; and Righteousnesse named apart from godlinesse, is the roote of all duties amongst men: it is as the Tree, and all other vertues of the second Table, as the branches; it is as a Fountaine, they be as the Riuers; it is as the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:3215:190"/>
body, they as the members. This Righteousnesse is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished into habituall or actuall Righteousnesse; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall Righteousnesse is that gift of God, which is pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the hearts of the Elect, to enable them to will and to doe good things, tending to the good of our Neighbour, whereof in the fourth to the <hi>Ephesians;</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual righteousnesse is the exercise of this gift, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of loue we practise such things wherby our neighbor may be benefited. Hereof the Apostle spake, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 19. <hi>He that worketh Righteousnesse, is righteous.</hi> This gift and act of Righteousnesse, is that, for the which <hi>Noah, Lot,</hi> and sundry others, are highly commended in the holy Scripture; <hi>Gen</hi> 6. 9: <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 1. Now as touching the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about Righteousnesse, betweene the Children of God and others; this is it: The godly through this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Righteousnesse, are disposed freely and of their owne accord to seeke the good of euery of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, in one thing as wel as in another, according to the rules of the Word, vnto the glory of God. Whereas the wicked doe some righteous things to some persons now and then whom they affect, which crosse not their owne pleasure, nor gaine or credite: not out of any loue to men, nor out of any respect to Gods will or glory; but out of selfe-loue, <note n="*" place="margin">Hence it is, that such righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous persons as these, doe turne away from their righteousnes; and so lose themselues &amp; their labour: Eze. 18.</note> with by-respects of vaine glory and worldly profit: and therefore in nothing doing righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and in most things committing vnrighteousnesse; cleane contrary to the course of iust and righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who doe worke righteous things, and that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, out of charity vnto men, and vnto the praise of God; and that at all times, and towards all kind of men, both friends and enemies, according to their meanes, and as occasions be offered them: truly repenting where

                     <p>SIR, it hath been taught me, that vnder Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, are contained all duties towards God and men, and that in this sense, Godlinesse is a part of Righteousnesse; howbeit, I perceiue that wee are to speake of it, as it is separate and distinct from godlinesse. And now you haue spoken thus far of Righteousnesse, were it not good that wee first set vpon these workes of Righteousnesse, which wee are bound to performe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, in respect of some degree that God hath put vpon vs? for thus it hath pleased God himselfe to proceede, in the laying out those duties of the second Table; he beginneth with such duties as we owe vnto others, in regard of our place and degree: <hi>Honour thy father, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Indeede friend <hi>Aquila,</hi> you say well; and this platforme had not beene amisse: for the decalogue (or ten Commandements of the Law) as they doe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately come from God; so they are most perfect for matter, and most exquisite for order and manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery; the chiefest and greatest duties first mentioned, and after the meaner and lesser, and that both in the first and second Table: howbeit we are not bound so strictly and precisely to follow that order in our teaching and instruction: but that it may be altered without fault. A president of which alteration, is the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, both in his fift Chapter to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> and the 3.
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:3215:191"/>
and fourth Chapter to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> wherein after do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, he descendeth to morall duties; and he affordeth the first place to such as be common, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto the peculiar and proper duties, in which steppes I thinke it fit for vs to tread in, speaking first of generall, and next of speciall duties.</p>

                     <p>I mislike not your purpose; and yet ere you<note place="margin">Sincerity or truth, is in all graces as a common ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynt or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> deale with such particular graces, as enable vs to doe duties to other men, and to our selues: let me call to mind, that which you saide before of the workes which we are to doe towards God, that truth and sincerity is an affection common to them all, to distinguish them from the workes of piety done by Hypocrites, who haue a certaine feare of God, and loue of God, &amp;c: but it is seuered from truth; it being the mercy done to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified persons, that they should truly loue and feare God, and doe all duties towards him in soundnesse; right so is it in these duties which belong to men. As in our natural body, bloud is dispersed through all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and where bloud is, there is spirit too: so sincerity and truth runneth through all duties, as bloud in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and where any grace is, there is truth with it: and all the good things which the godly doe, are done in truth, and godly vprightnesse. They loue their Neighbour in truth, and are truly mercifull, and truly meeke, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sober, and truly chaste, and not in appearance onely to the eye of men, but be such before God as they seeme to be before men, in all duties seeking to honour and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the name of God; wherein lyeth the grand diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene them and the vngodly, who doe the same things for matter and substance, which holy men doe; but not in the same manner, because they are voide of sincerenesse.</p>

                     <p>You say right. As euery Starre doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the light of the Sunne, to take brightnesse from it; so truth and sincerity passeth through all Christian graces, euen as the soule that doth animate and quicken euery part of the body: for all graces, if they lacke truth and soundnesse, they be as rotten members, or as sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and dead carkases, which carry the semblance of graces, and are not: the true fire doth not more differ from the painted, then grace from grace; that is, the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere graces from such as be but counterfet. A Man or a Lyon pictured artificially, seemes a man or a lyon, and is not; so vertues seuered from truth and sincerity, haue a goodly shew, but are not the liuely things themselues. But now it were meete that we did set vpon that amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">The fixt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> grace of loue, which is the glue and band that linkes all other graces together, and holds vs Chistians fast tyed and linked as many stickes in one bundle. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worthily it is called, the band of perfection, without which, all humane things fal apeeces, and come to ruine. Let me heare what you haue heard and learned of this worthy grace of loue, wherewith we loue one another, whose gift it is, whence it springs, what it is, what are the properties and effects of it, the manner and measure thereof; and what are the duties of loue, whom we are to loue, and by what perswasions we may be incited to the exercise of this vertue; wherein it differs from faith, and finally, how we may ouercome the lets and hinderances of loue, with such other things as shall come to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; not forgetting to tell vs along as you goe, how true loue differs from the counterfet.</p>

                     <p>Sir, ye haue enioyned mee taske enough, which I had rather it had happened to your selfe; but
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:3215:192"/>
sithence ye haue put it on me, I will performe my ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour; be you ready to helpe defects: and by your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I will first tell you what it is. I take Loue or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity<note place="margin">Loue.</note> to be that grace, whereby wee are moued to hold<note place="margin">What bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue is.</note> our Neighbour deare vnto vs; also to desire and seeke his good in all things that be deare vnto him, euen as we would haue our selues and our things deare vnto others. This grace it is the free gift of God, who is Loue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and author &amp; worker of loue in all others. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth God for this gift, and prayseth him for it; as in his salutation of the Churches is to be well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: no man nor other creature can worke loue in vs, and by nature we haue it not; it is God onely, who out of his free mercy, doth both plant, and continually vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it in vs. And let this generally be spoken of loue, and all the other vertues following, that they grow not in the barren soyle of our hearts, but come from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, being the fruites and <hi>gifts of Gods Spirit, Galat.</hi> 5. 22. This Loue giuen vs of God, is alwayes linked with the loue of God, whose Daughter it is, being bred and brought forth by it: for therefore we loue our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, because we first loue God. Thus the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth; 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 21. Our mutual loue being a beame of our loue to God, as our loue to God, is a sparkle of his loue to vs: neither can any man loue <hi>God,</hi> but because he is first loued of him; neither can any loue man, who first doth not loue God; neither can any but loue men, who haue in them the loue of God: for this enforceth vs for Gods sake to loue such as he will haue vs loue, hauing put his Image and likenesse in them, and neerely linked them to vs; the parties whom wee are to loue, are our Neighbour; that is, euery one that commeth of <hi>Adam;</hi>
                        <pb n="358" facs="tcp:3215:193"/>
of what Countrey, Religion, Language soeuer, euen e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man and woman, being so neere to vs, as to be of our kind and bloud; and hauing any need of vs in any sort, euery such is our Neighbour, vpon whom we must bestow our loue: not as commonly men thinke them onely to be our Neighbours, who dwelles in the same streete or burrow. The parable of the Samaritan quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this, who acknowledged the wounded Iew for his Neighbour; <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 33. Christs example also, doing good to Samaritans, as well as Iewes; <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 26. cleareth this point.</p>

                     <p>But seeing God onely is to be loued, and that with all the heart; is it not a wrong to God, to giue any portion of our loue from him to any creature?</p>

                     <p>Not at all; for the loue where with wee loue<note place="margin">How our Neighbour may be loued, without iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God.</note> our Neighbour, is not a seuerall loue from that with which we loue God, but a branch or streame of it, in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of men for Gods sake, wee loue God in our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Euen as it is the same Sunne which giueth light in the field and in the house, vpon land and in the water; so it is the same loue which imbraceth God and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in louing whom we witnesse, and shew how well and truly we loue God, so long as our Neighbour is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for God, and in God; because he belongs vnto him, and beares his likenesse, and that our loue of him, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Gods glory; we may neuerthelesse loue God with all our heart, I say if wee loue our Neighbour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and for God. Indeede if we loue our Neighbour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, or more then God, or for our owne sake and profit, then our heart is diuided, and our loue it is not right: and this is one thing which distinguisheth false loue from true, worldly charity from Christian. This

                        <note place="margin">An enemy is a neighbour and a brother, if he be a christian.</note> be my Neighbour, then my enemy cannot be excluded from my loue; especially seeing Christ hath so strictly commanded it: <hi>Luke 6. Loue your enemies.</hi> Yea, and most highly commended it, as a speciall marke and note of Gods Child, to distinguish him from others, who can and doe loue their louers. Euery wicked man can doe that, to be friendly to their friends; but to be louingly affected to such as hate vs, doing good readily to such as hurt vs, and that for Gods sake, because he will haue it so; this declareth vs to haue him to our Father, who is kind to the vnkind, and doth good to the euil, giuing his <hi>Sonne to die for his enemies; Rom.</hi> 5. 8. and to haue him for our Head and Sauiour, who made intercession for his crucifiers: and finally, to be brethren to him, who <hi>prayed for his persecutors; Acts</hi> 7. 60. Againe, we know not but that our enemy may be the Childe of God; in truth, either he is already so, or he may be so; howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be, if he be a Christian, we are sure he is our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and in that regard we are bound to loue him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not onely a Neighbour neere vnto vs in nature, comming of the same bloud, hauing the similitude of God, but a brother also, professing the same Lord, and so linked vnto vs by band of Religion, hauing the same Baptisme, faith, hope, and inheritance; all which should worke in me a louing mind towards such, yea, though I knew they did abhorre me.</p>

                     <p>Ye say very right. And indeed this is the tryall and touchstone of our loue to proue it by, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be counterfet or sound: for he that can loue his enemy vpon these grounds, doth certainely approue himselfe to be endued with Christian charity, and to be indeede the childe of God, led by his Spirit; forso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as none saue such, can loue their enemy in such sincere sort as hath beene saide. But you haue shewed me that my Neighbour is my enemy, no lesse then my friend; let me heare now whether ye put any difference betweene a neighbour and brother, and whether there be any degrees in our loue?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aquila.</speaker>
                     <p>There is this difference. A Neighbour is<note place="margin">Difference betweene a neighbour &amp; a brother.</note> more generall: for euery brother is a neighbour; but not on the contrary. A Neighbour is euery man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whether they be Christians or Infidels, Iew, Turk, Heathen, Barbarian, Papist, or whosoeuer: but a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that person who onely is a Christian, professing with mee the same Christian doctrine, and agreeing with me in the same worship of God. The company and society of these, are called the Houshold of faith; the Church of God: so as a Christian is both my brother and my neighbour, whereas one may be my neighbour, who is not my brother. As the Samaritane was to the Iew, and as <hi>Paul</hi> was to <hi>Publius</hi> and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. Now according to this difference are the degrees of loue, as the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught vs; <hi>Galat.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Doe good to all, but especially to the Houshold of Faith:</hi> for wee are tyed to these by more, and also by more streight bonds. If a Turke be in necessity, I am bound to helpe him (so as I helpe him not against Christ) but if a Turke and a
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:3215:194"/>
Christian both want, and my store will releeue but the one, I am bound to shew my loue rather to my Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian brother. I may pity the misery of a Turke, when I cannot releeue him, because he is my flesh; I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue a Christian before him, who is both my flesh and my brother. Likewise amongst Christian brethren, there is a great oddes, which will make a great oddes in our loue.</p>

                     <speaker>Apollos.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, you then doe thinke that there are degrees of loue towards the Brethren, and that of them some are to be loued, before, and more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>I doe thinke so; and I thinke it not without<note place="margin">Degrees of Loue.</note> reason: for amongst the Brethren, some be also our kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes, our brethren, sisters, parents, &amp;c. Also some of them haue receiued more excellent gifts, and be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with power and will to doe more excellent things for the common good. Now where there be more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of loue, there ought our loue more to shew it selfe; herein we must follow God, and it is a sure way, to set our loue most on them, towards whom God hath most exprest his loue. When we reade of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that he was the Disciple whom Iesus loued, me thinkes it intimates and declares thus much vnto vs, that he did prefer him in his loue: for it is out of doubt, that he loued the rest which were good; yet <hi>Iohn</hi> more then the rest, because of some notable grace that hee had aboue the rest: for Christs loue was not partiall, neither must ours be. But there is some difference to be put betweene the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and fruites of our loue; oftentimes these must be extended to some brethren more plentifully, by reason of the great wants, towards whom yet wee haue not
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:3215:195"/>
such a feruent affection of loue, as to others which be more perfect. As fathers will most affect their best chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yet will take greatest paines about the worst, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they neede most; greatest care must be vsed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards greatest infirmities: but greatest graces must haue greatest affection of loue. Godly men doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time faile herein, as we may see in <hi>Isaac</hi> towards <hi>Esau;</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> towards <hi>Adoniah</hi> &amp; <hi>Absalon:</hi> howbeit good men may not be followed in their euill, but in their good things.</p>

                     <p>Now let mee heare of the manner of our loue, by what rules it must be guided towards Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Brothers, friends and enemies.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Aquila.</speaker>
                     <p>For the well gouerning of our loue, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching<note place="margin">Rules to guide our loue.</note> the manner, and measure, and end, we haue sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry rules giuen vs in Scripture: the first is, to loue our Neighbour as our selfe. Now as the Apostle saith; <hi>No man hateth himselfe, but wisheth all good to himselfe; Mat.</hi> 22. Now such as with a right ruled loue doe loue themselues, they doe not onely wish, but procure such things to themselues, as indeed be wholsome and good for them, both for their bodies and soules; abandoning such things as be euill and noysome to either, haue they neuer such apparance and shew of good and profit: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thus ought euery man to loue his neighbour. And according to the second rule, looke what things by the iudgement of sound reason wee would haue done, or not done to our selues; these things wee should be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to haue done, or not done to another; be he friend or foe: <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. Also in what measure and degree we desire that our Neighbor should loue our selues, in the same we ought to loue them againe. The third rule is,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:3215:195"/>
to <hi>loue as brethren;</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. That is, such loue as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall brethren ought to beare, both for manner and measure, one to another; such, euen such, so hearty and vehement ought the loue of Christians to be amongst themselues, knowing that they are brethren by a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood, consecrated and ratified in the bloud and death of Christ our elder brother, who hath charged vs (as one who may command vs) to <hi>loue one another, as he hath loued vs; Iohn</hi> 13. 15. <hi>Loue one another, as I haue giuen you example.</hi> And againe, <hi>a new commandement I giue you, that ye loue one another, as I haue loued you; Iohn</hi> 13. 15. That so ye loue one another, this is our fourth and best rule, to direct vs in our brotherly Christian loue, which must be vnfained, without hypocrisie or counterfeiting, earnest without coldnes &amp; indifferency, constant without change or wearinesse, free without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of our owne pleasure or profit; and very great, not small and meane: for thus Christ loued vs, for in that he would besides his doctrine, his miracles, his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of life, his prayers; in all which, he witnessed his loue, vouchsafed also to giue himselfe to such a death, and that for his enemies. This declareth how sincere, free, constant, and exceeding great his loue was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs; wherein though we cannot equall him by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to his perfection, which is not possible, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of vs: yet wee must be like to him in our loue, and striue to come so neere as wee may; which is both required, and possible. And herein the true Christian doth differ from the false, that the one in his loue looks vpon Christs loue, as his patterne, and thereto frameth his owne; but the other hath no thought at all to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Christ: as he hath him for no Sauiour, so he makes
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:3215:196"/>
him no example. The godly Christian, who belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him to be a Redeemer, doth labour to follow him as a guide and sampler; as in this duty of loue, so in all other Offices of Christianity.</p>

                     <p>As there be certain common reasons which<note place="margin">Reasons why wee ought to loue.</note> may perswade our loue towardes all men whatsoeuer they are, to wit, because they are the creatures of God; our flesh and bloud, of one kind with vs, our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: also being made after Gods Image, hauing a commandement to loue them, and the examples of godly men, who haue done good to all, out of an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of loue, and because wee would haue others to loue vs; so there be peculiar and speciall reasons to moue vs vnto the loue of our brethren, which hold the same faith that we doe: and of these I will giue you but a light touch, it shall be sufficient to name them; our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ought to be more in practising them, then in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them. It were enough that it is the will of our Father which is in Heauen, that his Children should dwell in loue, and that he hath by his example gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs; first louing, and still louing vs, and that he hath made vs partakers of the same grace, to be all euen Christians, brethren, fellow heires, members of Christ, his seruants, his friends, his children, his Spouse, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; also, that except we truly loue one another,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:3215:196"/>
we cannot loue God, nor be loued of him, nor haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny assurance that wee be his people, or looke for any blessing, but for all wrath from him; yet vnto all this, if wee adde the sweete pleasure and delight which is in brotherly loue (behold how pleasant) and the great and manifolde commodities which arise and grow thereby, (behold how good it is for brethren to dwell together in vnity) our loue being for comfort and delight like that precious oyntment, and for profit like that deaw of <hi>Hermon;</hi> and withall if wee doe consider the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of hatred, being as gall and wormewood, and the hurt which it bringeth, all this would greatly preuaile with vs, to stirre vp and encrease mutuall loue.</p>

                     <p>Let me stop you a little in your course; what be these profits which loue brings, and the discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which follow the wants of it?</p>

                     <p>Whiles Christians are ioyned together, they are strong as an army, where the Souldiers keepe euery one his ranke; or as a wall, where the stones be all ioyned together. Also we may boldly come with our selues &amp; seruice vnto God, vnder hope of acceptance; wee thereby greeue the aduersaries of God, which see our accord through loue, and reioyce the godly: we spite Sathan, whose kingdome is more hindered by vs, the more that loue doth abound: we glorifie the word of God, and glorifie our profession, our prayers haue more feruency and fruit. As on the other side, through lacke of loue amongst brethren, God and his Gospell be dishonoured, Sathan pleased, and the wicked made glad our safety hazarded, because a house diuided can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stand; our prayers hindered and reiected, with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite discommodities, which lamentable experience

teacheth men better to know, then any mans speech can doe. The Apostle aymeth at the great commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and necessity, as also at the excellency of loue, when he bids vs aboue all things, <hi>to put on loue;</hi> and when hee likeneth it to a bond, calling it, <hi>the bond of perfection; Colos.</hi> 3. 14. because it knitteth our selues, and our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties together; and vnto sinewes and ioynts, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.

                     <p>The properties of loue were touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when wee heard that we must loue as Christ lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; but he that will be further instructed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties<note place="margin">Properties of Loue.</note> and effects of loue: let him thinke vpon the first to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> 13. 5, 6, 7, 8. where the Apostle affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of Christian charity, that it is kind, and not enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, neither boasting nor proud, doing no vncomely thing, seeking not her owne things; not suddenly angry, nor thinking euill, reioycing in the truth, not in iniquity; suffering all things, beleeuing all things, hoping all things, enduring all things; the neerer that our loue is to
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:3215:197"/>
these qualities, the holier it is: the further off, the worse, and none at all it is, if it be voide of them. Touching the workes and actions of loue, I find they be either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,<note place="margin">Actions of Loue.</note> which wee conceiue in our hearts, or outward, which we expresse in our liues, words, and deeds, either towards the soules, or bodies of our Neighbour. The inward workes of loue, be these, to thinke no euill but good of others; for loue thinketh no euill: to wish them well, and desire their good euery way, to reioyce with them for their welfare, being so cheared with their good things, as with our owne: to mourne with them for the aduersities and euils which befall them, according to the counsell of <hi>Paul; Reioyce with them that reioyce, and mourne with them that mourne.</hi> This fellow feeling when we pity others infirmities and miseries, and be glad for their prosperity and well doing; it is the maine mentall duty of loue. Now for outward actions of loue, they concerne others in their person, substance, or name; they be all the workes commanded in the second Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Law, which be innumerable: but briefly to giue you a short sum of them, to the substance of our neighbour, we owe this duty, to encrease and maintaine it by all good meanes; giuing &amp; lending to such as need, and that freely, without any compact or bargaine, to haue the principall with increase; yea, euen where there is no hope to haue the principal restored: prouided, that need &amp; not riot do driue them to borrow, and that their want of ability, and not of good will, doe hinder them from payment. Also if we haue found ought which is others, or if any thing be of trust committed to vs, or that wee haue wrongfully got into our hands any por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Neighbours substance, that we carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:3215:198"/>
if we be able; <hi>Eze.</hi> 18. in all bargaines and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts dealing iustly and plainely without fraude or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5. Finally, practising the workes of our particular callings with faithfulnesse and diligence, that we may be profitable to all with whom we liue, seruing others through loue, and affoording our counsell and paines, and whatsoeuer else we can do to further others welfare in their estate, both of goods and body; if it be in our power, not onely to feede him when hee is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, refresh him with drinke being thirsty, harbouring the harbourlesse, visiting him in prison; but ministring to him being sicke: not onely out of our purse, but also of our skill, if we know any thing that may ease or cure his paine; <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 4, 5. As concerning his name, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer speaking of our Neighbour but in loue, not for the empairing, but for the maintaining of his name, when with reason and truth we may, alwayes vttering an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right sentence of all men, auoyding slanders, lies, false reports in our selues, and beating them downe in others; especially as concerning his soule, neuer to be wanting to the good thereof: but aboue, and before all other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to preferre such as wee are to doe to his saluation, endeauouring vpon all occasions offered, to admonish our brother with wisedome &amp; loue, exhorting his slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and quickening his dulnesse to good things, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting the feeble minded, strengthening the weake in an hearty compassion of their infirmities; instructing the ignorant, rebuking the froward with all patience, and long suffering, bearing, for bearing, giuing, forgiuing wrongs; in our prayers remembring the wants of the Saints, continuing thus to doe in all humblenesse and meekenesse; knowing that Christian loue most of all
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:3215:198"/>
consists in these duties, because they concerne the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of man, which is his soule, &amp; tend to the chiefest good, that is, the attainement of euerlasting life. To be<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Faith and Loue.</note>

                        </gap> in this point of Loue, to answer your last demand, as in many other things this Christian charity differeth from faith, it being the fruite, faith being the roote; faith beleeuing the promise, loue fulfilling the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Ro.</hi> 13. Faith iustifying vs before God: Loue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clating vs before men to bee iust persons. So in other things also, as namely faith receiueth something to it selfe; to wit, Christ, and his benefits: whereas Loue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth out it selfe in all the former duties we haue spoken of, and many more whereof we shall speake hereafter. Faith looketh properly to Christ, and profiteth our selues; Loue looketh to God and Angels, and men both good and bad, and endeuoureth to profit many. Hence it is, that the Apostle preferreth loue before faith; 1 <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> 13. as also, for that faith ceaseth at the end of this life; whereas <hi>loue endureth after this life:</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. verse last.</p>

                     <p>I perceiue by your discourse of Loue, that you confound loue and brotherly kindnesse, as if they were but one grace; whereas the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish them, and make them twaine: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7.</p>

                     <p>I doe handle them together; for that I find the Scripture doth often comprehend brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnder loue, when loue is taken in the largest sense, as it reacheth to all men whatsoeuer: howbeit, I doe not<note place="margin">Brotherly kindnesse.</note> denie, but the Apostle doth seuer them; 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. In which place he considers loue, as it doth embrace men as men, because they are our Neighbours, and of our kind; and brotherly kindnesse, as it is a more neere and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:3215:199"/>
inward affection, such as is expressed to men, as they be our brethren, Christians, and fellow Citizens. This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference I may thus set it downe. I may compare our hearts to a great large house, whose hall is loue, and the parlour brotherly kindnesse: as then a great man admits all friends, strangers, one and other into his hall, so our loue is to lie open vnto all men, without respect or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; but our brotherly kindnesse we communicate onely to such as are our euen Christians, as we doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our nearest acquaintance onely to haue accesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our parlour: Thus I conceiue the meaning of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Peter,</hi> when he doth seuer these two graces.

draw to some conclusion with speed; and because you may the better beare the greatest weight, I wil continue to put you to speake of those graces which are behind, enioyning you to obserue the Law of breuity. The next vertue &amp; worke of the Spirit after Loue, is Peace; which is as the Daughter, and Loue as the Mother; or as the hand-maide, and loue as the Mistrisse: for Loue begets Peace, and peace doth attend loue; where Loue goeth before, there Peace waites at the heele: it is hatred stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp contention, but Peace followes and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Loue.

                  <p>Sir I am heartily sorry for debility of your body; it would be greeuous to me that you should faile of performance of this which we haue begun: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you require speed in this businesse, I wil obey your motion, in fauour of your weakenesse, and out of desire to accomplish this enterprize. I haue learned from your<note place="margin">Foure kinds of Peace.</note> selfe and others, that there is a peace with God; also with our selues, called, Peace of Conscience. Thirdly, with the Creatures; and lastly, with our Neighbour: which if it be in Common-wealth, Countrey, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it is ciuill Peace: domesticall Peace if it be in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, &amp; that peace which is in the Church amongst pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours, is Christian Peace; whereof we are to speake. This is such a knitting together of our mindes in God, and among our selues, as that neither in Religion by schisme or heresie, or in our daily conuersation by brawles, quarrels, and suites, there appeare any strife or variance, but a good agreement on all hands. Now in
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:3215:200"/>
this vertue of Peace the godly doe much differ from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, because they embrace and maintaine Peace and agreement, out of loue which they beare one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, especially towards God; for that they would not offend him by dissention, nor be rent asunder from their brethren, whom they vnfainedly affect. Wherupon they are very carefull not to minister any occasion of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, neither to take hold on occasions, being offered by others either in weakenesse, or of purpose; chusing to forgoe and remit their owne right, after the example of their Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> rather then to striue and fall out: remembring that they are brethren by profession, and how that peace is a thing very delightfull to God, and exceeding pleasing and good for all men; carrying with it innumerable commodities and benefits to mans life, being a shadow and representation of that felicity which godly men shall haue in the life which is eternall; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 6; whereof peace is a chiefe part. In which regard the godly had rather suffer wrong, then to enter into contention, which is bitter as gall and wormewood to their soule, being as hurtfull to mankind, as it is hatefull and odious to God. Vpon these considerations, all good men as they endeuour peace, carefully looking to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues neither to affoord, nor apprehend matter of strife: so on the other side, if by the malice of Sathan, and the weakenesse of men, an entrance be made into dissention, they are willing and forward to pacifie and quench the sparkles; very well knowing that the beginning of strife, is as the opening of a flood-gate: and that it is euer<note place="margin">Prouerbs 17.</note> doubtfull what will be the end thereof. They therefore doe their best to stop contention at the first, yea, though they be like to make aduantage of strife; yet the loue of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:3215:200"/>
peace, and of their brethren, more preuailes with them, then the desire of contention or of luker. Now all the children of this world be otherwise affected in this duty of peace; their minds are not peaceably disposed, the way of peace they know not: <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. If they liue peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with others, it is not because they truly loue peace, and their neighbours; but out of selfe-loue, when it may serue their turne to auoide some trouble which they would not fall into, or to hold some benefit which they haue by good agreement with others; so long, and so far they frame themselues to peace: but if it come to this, that they must lose any thing by yeelding peaceably to concord, or that discord will draw more commodity to them, they then make themselues ready for warre; easily they giue, and in these cases as easily they will snatch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion giuen of falling out, secretly and vnder hand nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing and encreasing matter of strife and debate; being bent rather to offend God and their brethren, then to remit but a little of their will and profit: neither foreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, nor caring what hurtfull things follow to others by strife, so themselues may goe away gainers.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I doe well remember it hath been taught me, that the godly hold this grace of peace with imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; so as they are sometimes through frailety, and the subtill reaches of Sathan, at variance not onely with euil men, but haue iarres and bitter strife amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Example whereof we haue in the Apostles stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:3215:201"/>
for superiority, who should be greater then others; <hi>Mathew</hi> 18. 1. and in <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas; Acts</hi> 15. Also in the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galathia;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 11. God so disposing it for most good ends, as to discouer hypocrites, to try the godly, and to bring his secret counsels to passe. Howbeit the godly afterwards are ashamed, and doe repent of their folly, and become more wary and more studious of peace then before. This being most true of all godly persons, that though they now and then forget themselues, and so fall into dissentions, yet their life is so ordered, as that the whole carriage of it for the most part tends to peace: for God hath so blessed them, that they are free from such vices as stirre vp strife; their heart it is without loue of all contention, pride, and vaine glory, anger, hatred, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, desire of reuenge, taking things in the euill part; which are the very bellowes of variance, and break-neckes of all peace. On the contrary, it is filled with a quiet spirit, with humility, contentment, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, long-sufferance, meekenesse, forgiuing offences, interpreting things in good part, when with reason and truth they may; which be the very Nurses of Peace, and break-neckes of all contentions: their words also being not greeuous, but few, soft, and vpright; far from false reports, or tale-carrying, not vsing scornefull, nor brawling speeches; <hi>Iudges</hi> 8. 2, 3. And finally, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their hands from striking, violent and vniust dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; and they doe well know how to vse a wise silence, when speaking may kindle, or encrease anger: by this meanes it commeth to passe, that they easily gaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and agreement with their brethren, and as easily maintaine it. All being quite contrary in wicked men,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:3215:201"/>
who furthermore doe herein differ from the righteous, that as they will not haue peace with whom they should, so they will sometimes haue it with whom they should not: as they study not to seeke peace with all, but with such as themselues list; so they are ready for sinister respects, there to liue peaceably where the godly doth not find it possible, vnlesse hee would haue warre with God, by hauing peace with his enemies. Whereas this is the way of Gods Children, that if it lie in them and be possible, they will haue peace with all; if there be not peace, it is because it is not in their power, or because they hold a iust warre better then an vngodly peace. But on the other part, euill men as they giue no dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to haue agreement when they might and ought, so they are content to accord with them with whom they ought to haue no fellowship: for what communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can the Christian which is Christs friend, haue with an Idolater, or with any other of Gods enemies? Yet I am far off from condemning those leagues of concord which Christian Princes doe make with Infidels and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, vpon necessity of commerce and trafficke for the better maintenance of this life, by exchanging of commodities, or for common defence, where there is no league of amity stricken, to agree and accord with them in their superstitions and vngodlinesse. Such leagues of peace we reade of betweene <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Abimelech, Geneses</hi> 23. betweene <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Hyram,</hi> King of <hi>Siria;</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 1. between <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the King of the <hi>Ammonites;</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 1.</p>

                  <p>Yet by your good leaue I meane to adde this one thing; namely, that Gods Children are of such a peaceable temper, as they will not fall out, no, not with the worst men: till it come to this, that they must differ from them in some wicked cause; and euen then they doe so refraine to haue communion with them in the cause, as that if it may be, and doe lie in them, they will not haue warre with their persons: but when they must breake off fellowship with their persons (they and their bad cause being so linked, that he that will like the one, must allow, or seeeme at least to allow the other) yet then they so breake off society, and stand off from their company, as it is with pity and griefe for their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and with prayer to God for their repentance; this is it whereunto they aime, being sorry if they faile. Now Sir I am well pleased that we step forwards to conferre of those graces, which a little before we haue seene to goe together with this peaceable heart of the godly man; whereof one is Humility: for as the child of God<note place="margin">Humility.</note> walkes humbly with his God, giuing him all glory for<note place="margin">Micah. 6. 8. col. 3. 10.</note> all good things, acknowledging and feeling in himselfe nought saue sinne and misery; so hee carrieth himselfe humbly towards his brethren, whose graces and good works he doth reuerence, and with loue make mention of them, in like loue couering wants and euils. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing priuy to such a number of corruptions in himselfe, he adiudgeth himselfe the meanest of all, and worst of all others, and esteemeth others better then himselfe; being ready not out of the basenesse of mind, but out of a lowly spirit to doe any seruice, how troublesome or meane soeuer, to the comfort or helpe of any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian; after the example of Christ, abasing himselfe to
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:3215:202"/>
wash his Apostles feete, and also humbling himselfe for his enemies euen to the death of the Crosse; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 5, 6. The like mind hath euery godly Christian, who forgets and denies himselfe, that he may stoope to euery duty whereby hee may be helpefull to his euen Christians, and yet so farre from looking after any praise, as if he be praised especially in his owne presence, hee is ready to blush; <hi>Prou.</hi> 27, 2. being more desirous to heare of his fallings, that hee may be the more humbled, then to be commended for his well doings, lest he waxe proude. As for those stirrings of pride, which none of Gods Children are wholy freed from, they much dislike them in their iudgement, and loath them in their hearts, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and praying against them, with crauing of pardon for them; knowing how much God abhorreth the high minded to depresse them, and that the way to glory, is paued and prepared by humility: it being written, that <hi>God will lift vp the humble;</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5, 5. Now this is further to be considered, that with this singular humility, there is ioyned in the godly a comely and reuerent grauity,<note place="margin">Grauity.</note> staying and ordering their affections within, and mode rating their gestures, words, countenances, and actions without, according to the dignity of their persons and callings; that as their humble carriage gaineth them loue, so of their graue behauiour there ariseth much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence towards them. It is not so with the euil and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous men, who be vaine and light, hauing no gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity at all, or none but affected grauity, little conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the excellency of their estate and place. They be voide also of true humility, because they forget the worthinesse of others; therefore either out of the pride of their hearts they doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:3215:203"/>
themselues better then they: as the Pharises in the Gospell did, or out of basenesse of mind, yeelding to all persons in all things without difference; not respecting what in duty they owe, but being forwards to doe any thing which may please, or procure themselues respect and praise: whereof if they happen to faile and misse, they are thereby more daunted and troubled, then they are comforted by the seruice which they did, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in <hi>Achitophell.</hi>

                  <p>It is a thing that you haue very well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that Gods Children doe so remember the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of others, to be humbled &amp; lowly towards them; as withall they doe not forget their owne worthinesse, to cause in them a godly grauity, to deliuer their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse from contempt. Now after these things thus touched, we are next in order to speake of gentlenesse,<note place="margin">Gentlenesse.</note> that grace and vertue which makes a Christian milde and tractable, apt to please, loath to displease, easie to be entreated, ready to yeeld to others, and to doe them any fauour with reason; a vertue wherein Christ excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,<note place="margin">It is reported that Peter he wept so often as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Ye speake truth; but the difference is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and apparant: for first Gods Children in exercising gentlenesse, preferre them that doe feare God, being most gentle towards them, euen in that respect, without regard to their owne pleasure or profit: others are gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle indifferently to all, and least of all to such as be good. Againe, the godly will not be gentle when they must be seuere; whereof <hi>Moyses</hi> is an example, being a man maruellous gentle, yet in Gods cause exceeding seuere and stout; <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 27. It is contrariwise in men vnsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, who be sharpe and bitter in their owne, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse in Gods quarrell. Thirdly, the faithfull take care to doe nothing, out of their gentlenesse to please men, which may displease God; hereof wicked men haue no care. Moreouer, the godly will not turne their gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the hurt of any man, because hee loueth his neighbour, therefore he lookes circumspectly to it, not to doe him euill by his gentle dealing with him. Fnally, he is afraide least either he be too rough, or too gentle; being sorry if hee swarue at any time from the meane, crauing pardon euen of his weaknesse that way; a thing that euill men doe not trouble themselues withall. And as in gentlenesse, so in long-suffering the godly doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue<note place="margin">Long suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance &amp; peace</note> themselues to be the Elect of God, guided by the Spirit, and partakers of Gods Image: for whereas euill men are either stupid and soft, being without sence of iniuries done them, or else too hasty, and proue too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, soone and suddenly moued, many times vpon light and meane occasions. The godly haue such apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of trespasses done against them, as that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare wrath, bridling and biting in their anger, being
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:3215:204"/>
hardly prouoked vnto displeasure, waiting long, and with much patience for the amendment of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, after the example of their heauenly Father, who is slow to anger, and of great patience, as themselues haue felt him to be towards themselues by good experience, as well as by his owne testimony in Scripture. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as God being deeply prouoked by their owne sins, hath mercifully borne with them in his long-suffering nature; so they endeauour to deale with others that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, expecting if God at any time will giue them repentance for their sinnes. But as for euill men, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they are contented to suffer and forbeare, yet it proceeds not out of care to obey the commandement, which requires forbearance; or to follow the example of God: but either because they are not able to hurt such as trespasse them, or for feare of some hurt to themselues, if they should by impatiency breake out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any extreme and hard courses; or else they couet to be commended for quiet and patient men. But that we may goe forward, with this long-suffering and forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,<note place="margin">Forgiuing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</note> there goes hand in hand forgiuenesse of offences ouer against vs; when vpon due consideration, that God hath straitly commanded vs to forgiue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and for his Sonne Iesus Christs sake, hath pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto vs our owne manifold and great sinnes, we are moued againe for his sake, and for duty sake, to pardon our Neighbour all wrongs done by him against our selues, that it may be a testimoniall to vs of our owne forgiuenesse before God. Therefore we hold our selues bound not onely to keepe our selues from reuenge, but we are ready if our offending brother repent, and shew himselfe desirous of reconcilement with vs, to receiue

him into our fauour, according to the counsell of our Sauiour, willing to forgiue our brother, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto vs, saying, <hi>It repents me;</hi> and after his owne practise, embracing sinners vpon their conuersion: in which point there is one special caution to be obserued of vs, and it is this; that wee may sometimes vnfainedly forgiue and loue, where wee haue iust reason not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose trust and confidence. None more charitable then Christ, forgiuing his mortall enemies; yet where hee found <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Gods goodnesse, they also endeauour to doe good, and to be beneficiall to others; after the patterne which Christ hath set them. Of whom it is written, that hee <hi>went about doing good;</hi> either by some word or deede, priuately or publikely, ordinarily or extraordinarily, to mens bodies or soules, he was profitable and good. All true Christians be thus affected, they are sorry when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny houre hath passed without doing good to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and others; watching for opportunities, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their meanes endeuouring vpon offered oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions gladly to helpe all men, being carefull to take good, when they can doe none. Adde hereunto, that they are not onely sorry when none are the better for them, but that the good which they doe, is so little, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching and begging mercy, because they are so empty of goodnesse, and barren in doing good things; and as by their goodnesse they are carried in a great desire of being helpeful to all to whom they can doe good, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wearinesse, respect of persons, or hope of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: so their meeknesse enableth them to passe by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses<note place="margin">Meekenesse.</note> offered them by men, without purpose of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring euill for euill; also to beare with a quiet minde all crosses sent of God, referring themselues in them to his pleasure, according as their meeke Sauiour hath giuen them example; <hi>Father, as thou wilt; Mat.</hi> 26.

As amongst the Iewes, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of them did sundry good things, yet they enuied Christ because he did more; <hi>Mathew</hi> 26. Also <hi>Saul</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> (before an euill spirit possessed him) 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> performed much good vnto the people; yet he fretted and repined at <hi>Dauid,</hi> who did better things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by gained greater praise. By this it appeareth, that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites exercise themselues in doing good, not out of any habite of goodnesse, and from a loue of wel-doing, but vpon hope of receiuing the like good, or else to please themselues, and get them the name of good men; which is the cause (missing of their hoped ends) that after a time they waxe weary of doing good, and giue ouer that course, their hearts being vnsound: and howsoeuer they beare a likenesse and appearance of meekenesse, yet herein they bewray that they haue not true meekenesse, because they refuse to bring their hearts, their thoughts, and lusts, vnder the yoake of the Word; being also vnder Gods hand murmurers, and vnwilling to passe by abuses put vpon them by men. For
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:3215:206"/>
if so be that they are hardly prouoked vnto anger; yet in their anger stirred vpon iust causes, they exceede their bounds both for time and measure, yea and for manner too, holding out their displeasure longer; beeing also more deeply moued then they ought, and alwaies ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their anger more against the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, then against their sinnes. Whereas, if they were truly meekened, both they would suffer the Word of God to rule ouer their corrupt reason and euill desires, and also in their anger stirred vp against their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, they would so pursue his sinnes, as it should bee with commiseration and greefe for his person: after the example of that same most meeke Lambe of God, who in such sort conceyued indignation against the weaknesse of his Disciples, and wickednes of the Iewes: as yet his heart mourned, and his eyes shed teares, for the hardnesse of heart in the one, and for the infidelitie and maliciousnesse of the other.</p>

shrewd turne for another) yet when they do such things (as men soundly meeke would do, either putting down some affections which make insurrection against God, or putting vp some abuses done to them by men:) this commeth not of obedience vnto God, with desire to please and honour him; neyther is it ioyned with griefe and repentance for their slippes in this kinde; whereas godly persons, finding how hard a thing it is, to frame their thoughts and affections to bee plyable to Gods will, and to temper their anger towards men: as they striue to haue their fiercenesse to God and man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Sir, in naming these two vertues, yee haue but preuented me. These indeede are so proper to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate childe of God, as the naturall man can lay no claime vnto them. It is true, that vnregenerate men,<note place="margin">Mercy.</note> are not altogether without mercy: for Barbarians pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 18, 3. and the Samaritane the wounded lew, Luke 10. and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter did with compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion behold that exposed infant <hi>Moyses,</hi> Exod. 2, 6. but this is a meere naturall affection, and comes not from the Spirit, and it is exercised not of obedience to God, or for his sake and glory; but vpon carnall respect, such as flesh and blood suggests: extending it selfe vnto out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward miseries onely, not to soule calamities. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:3215:207"/>
naturall men haue no sense: and when their mercie is abused, it is ready to turn into cruelty and fiercenes; at the least, it will not breake through vnkindnesses, to witnesse it selfe towards such as deserue euill of them. But the mercy of Gods children, whether they doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect their fellow-feeling, in that they can take the harmes and losses of others as their owne, remembring them that are in bonds, as if they were bound the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, and them that are in prison as if they were afflicted, like members of a body, who suffer together, and reioyce together: or the effects and workes of this affection, in ministering to the needy things they lacke; as cloth to the naked, meate to the hungry, harbor to the harbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and all kinde of comforts. I say, in all this, they are led by the Spirit, which mooueth them thus to pity and succour others, euen for the Lords sake; because it is his will, and it tends to his glory; &amp; for their brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens sake, to refresh their bowels, and by such examples of mercy to win them to the Word.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, they are most affected and greeued with the spirituall euils of others, taking their sins to heart<note place="margin">Philip. 3, 18.</note> no lesse, if not more, then their corporall wants. Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for their ignorance and hardnesse of heart, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing instantly the Father of al mercy, to open their eies, to draw them out of darknesse. And this they doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, euen where they are prouoked, and not onely to their friends. As Christ wept ouer <hi>Ierusalem</hi> which crucified hirn: so true Christians haue compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their enemies. Further, when mercy is to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised vpon offered occasions, they stay not till they be entreated: but be hartily glad, that they may be a mean of comfort to any distressed. Euen as they would haue
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:3215:207"/>
refreshing &amp; help in their own afflictions &amp; trobles: so they are willing to respect others, out of a great desire to be like their mercifull Father, and to adorn the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of his Sonne, with the workes of mercy.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, where others take occasion of scorning their Brethren, of reioycing or triumphing ouer them, euen from these occasions the godly do prouoke them selues to pittifulnesse, with sighs and groanes, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and bewaile the follies and falles, the damages and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses which happen vnto others. Yea, the mercy of a<note place="margin">Prou. 12. 10.</note> righteous man rcacheth vnto beasts: not his owne one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but vnto the beasts of his enemies, to pull them out of the pit, or to bring them home being straglers. And whensoeuer they faile in these, or in any other dutie of mercy, either for substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, measure, or maner, they haue<note place="margin">Neh. 13, 14, 31</note> sorrow in themselues, and flye for pardon to the throne of grace; so farre off they be, from putting trust in their owne deeds: and all this, without desire or care to bee knowne or seene of men (further then needes must, or may bee, for their example and encouragement to the like mercifull workes) as they thinke it sufficient, that God who knoweth the heart, Math. 6, 2, 3, 4. is witnesse to the tendernesse of their affections towardes such, as are in any necessity or want.</p>
                  <p>As touching the next vertue, it is taking of things in good part, when any doubtful speeches or actions hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, which may be taken in euill part, and breed matter of dislike &amp; debate. These do the godly vse to interpret well, inclining alwayes to the best constructions which can be made of mens doubtfull words or doings. For, as in euident euils they will not suffer a curtaine to bee drawne ouer the eyes, not to see that which all men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold;
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:3215:208"/>
so in such things which may haue a good sence, they will not be so vncharitable as to make a bad inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.

It fareth thus with them they feare God, they choose rather to say nothing, then to speake vnprofitable and friuolous, vile, and hurtfull thinges. They haue learned, that in much talk there is iniquity; euen as a riuer that ouerfloweth the bank draweth with it much soyle and filth, so many words haue alwayes some fault; it being one of the hardest thinges in the world, to say much, and to say nothing amisse. Also no danger is like the danger which cometh by the slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinesse and foolishnesse of an hasty tongue. It sildom repents a good man that he saith too little, it often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents him that he spake too much. His silence doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer proue lesse greeuous to him, then his speech. For, the godly finde by experience, that both the peace of their owne conscience betweene them and God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the mutuall peace betweene them and their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, is more offended and hurt by saying much, then by saying nothing. So it is not without cause, that si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is termed a holding our peace, to shew this; that peace is gotten and preserued both to our selues, and with others, by prudent silence. Nothing is so sweete a friend to peace as silence, as many words much offend it. He is surely therefore an happy man, and fittest to

We might now passe forwards to speake of the vertue of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but that I would haue you to declare, how the Children of God doe differ from others in this duty of selfe-preseruation: for selfe-safety is a thing cared for of all men; but not alike of all men.</p>

For the chearefulnesse of the heart, maketh the countenance gladsome, and addeth strength to the bones; whereas the marrow of the bones (euen the chiefe and best strength of a man) is consumed by pensiue sadnesse and heauinesse of heart.

Now the men that truly feare God, as they are generally and vnfainedly well bent toward the good name of all others, especially of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; so they doe hold themselues bound to maintaine and encrease their own good report by all good means: not that they seeke a good name for it selfe, and out of vain-glory, or that they are discontented if that they be ill spoken of for well doing; <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. (which is a thing written on Heauen gates) but to the intent that they may be fitter to glorifie God, and doe more good vnto others, to whom themselues and their gifts would be more acceptable and profitable, the better that they be thought and spoken of. Hence it is, that they doe not onely looke to themselues, that they may be iust before men; but endeauour to flie euen secret sinnes in the

                  <p>If there be any vertue wherein vnregenerate men may seeme to match the godly as equall to them, me thinkes it is Contentment.

                  <speaker>Aquila.</speaker>
                  <p>For my part I do thinke, there is that likenes and neerenesse betweene some vnregenerate men, and the new borne children of God, both in this vertue of contentment, and diuers others, as that it is no very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie thing to discerne the oddes between them; &amp; though I may speak vnto you of some differences in this point, yet all the difficulty is in the finding of it out, when men come to the examination in themselues. And heerein is great neede of prayer, that God would put into vs the spirit of discretion, to make vs able to discouer the sound from the vnsound, both in this, and in all other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duties
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:3215:215"/>
both in our selues and others. But to come nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer vnto your Question, my answer to it shall bee gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and particular; my generall answer is this: I doe iudge graces to be in men vnregenerate, as passions are in God, vnto whom the Scriptures do attribute hatred, repentance, wrath, ielousie, greefe, and such like; which are in God not as they are passions or affections, but in respect of the worke which doth follow such passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, because he worketh and doth such things as men do, which are compassed with those affections. As men repenting vse to vndo what they haue done, and being wrathfull they vse to take reuenge; hence it is, that God his reuenging and destroying of his owne works, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his wrath and repentance. So it fareth with vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men, they are thought to haue meeknesse, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, chastity, contentednes, &amp;c. not for that these graces and the habit of these vertues bee in them, but for that they doe such outward actions, as men endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with these graces do, and vse to do.</p>
                  <p n="1">My particular answer is this: That all vnregenerate men do faile three seuerall wayes, as touching this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of contentment, which causeth it to bee in them a contentednesse rather in seeming, then in truth. The first is, though they confesse themselues well apayde with their estate, yet indeede their heart doth not rest in it, as in a good and sufficient lot assigned vnto them, in the which they can surely trust to finde God good &amp; gracious vnto them. For they doe not depend vpon God, because they lacke a liuely faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And withall, because they doe want the grace of true contentment, therefore it cannot be, but that they still wish for more, and would haue their estate bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:3215:215"/>
being of the quality of the Horse-leech, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Giue, giue; and like vnto the graue and the fire, which hauing consumed much matter and corpses, are ready to deuoure more.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Lastly; as their present estate is neuer so pleasing to them but a better would be more welcome: so if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny decay of their present condition, either for wealth or estimation, liberty or health, do happen &amp; fal forth, which commonly doth (mens estates being like to the Sea, which ebbeth and floweth, and vnto the Moone which waxeth and waineth) they are there with much disquieted and discontented: as appeareth in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Achitophel,</hi> both which in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, made shew of contentation, but in their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity they were sore troubled: as also was <hi>Nabal.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as such as be endued with true godlinesse, they do in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery estate submit themselues quietly and contentedly vnto the good will of God, beeing well satisfied with<note place="margin">Iob 1. verse last.</note> that which he appointeth vnto them whatsoeuer it is, more or little, better or worse: alwayes accounting the basest and meanest estate too good for them, because of their sinnes &amp; vnworthinesse; being pleased &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented euen with food and rayment, because they are assured, that that condition of life is best for them, that the most wise God sets them in. And nothing doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (such is his goodnesse) but that he will maintaine their life, giuing them sufficient to enioy though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them abundance, and turning all things to the best for them, according to his most true promises. Neither alone are they well pleased with their owne portion, without wishing or desiring in thought or wordes, the goods and estates of other men (without vnfained for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:3215:216"/>
if they doe:) but furthermore, they take good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleasure in the comforts and good things which their neighbours do enioy, euen as thogh it were their own: striuing to follow that precept, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to <hi>reioyce with them that reioyce,</hi> &amp; to <hi>Loue others as themselues, mourning with them in their heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>

                  <p>Here I haue three things to aske you. First,<note place="margin">Three doubts,</note> whether ye thinke any godly person free from all coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes? And then, whether the desire of more wealth and a better estate be couetousnesse? Lastly, whether a man may be couetous in his owne goods?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Aquila.</speaker>
                  <p n="1">To the first I answer negatiuely; There is no person by grace of regeneration wholly freed from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse, or any other sinne in this life. It is enough for this time of their pilgrimage, that they are deliuered from the curse and power of sinne: so as neither coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, nor any other sinne shall reigne in them, or<note place="margin">Master Luther confesseth that hee was not troubled great ly with this vice.</note> haue force to condemn them. Howbeit, as the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of other sinnes is in Gods children, so they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested with the stirring and ticklings of couetousnesse, more or lesse. The holy Prophet found an euill incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his heart, to desire earthly things inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which made him pray, that <hi>God would not encline his heart to couetousnesse,</hi> Psal. 119. that is, giue him ouer to that lust. Of this fault Christ often warned his own Apostles, amongst whom, one was ouercome by this vice, and the rest no doubt were tempted with it, else Christs warning had beene in vaine. It is well therfore, when resistance is made against the motions of Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse: for none shall altogether lacke the egging of this Lust.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="405" facs="tcp:3215:216"/>2. To your second demand, I answer affirmatiuely, That the desire of worldly wealth is couetousnesse. The nature whereof is expressed by three words of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> (as I haue heard you say:) One, signifieth the loue<note place="margin">Philarguria, Pleonexia.</note> of money, another the desire of riches, and the third signifieth the lust of hauing more. And seeing the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Apostle, Hebr. 13, 4. doeth set couetousnesse as the flat contrary vnto contentednesse, <hi>Let your conuersation</hi> (saith he) <hi>be without couetousnesse,</hi> and <hi>Be content with that ye haue;</hi> therefore, if our being satisfied, and resting pleased with our present estate be contentednesse, then the desire of more, or of a better estate in the World, must needs be couetousnesse. Euery man indeede, is bound to follow the duties of his calling, vppon which he may desire and pray for a blessing, with condition &amp; exception of Gods will, so much and so far as he thinks meete, leauing the successe thereof to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To conclude, as a man may be a theefe in his own, if he husband and employ it otherwise then God hath appointed, whose seruant he is, and to whom hee must giue account: so he may be couetous euen in his owne goods, if he loue them, set his heart vpon them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the bettering and encreasing of them, otherwise then by submitting himselfe to the will of God; beeing ready to receiue more if God wil adde and cast in more, with all thankfulnesse: yet being well apaide with that which is already, when God shall thinke it good, not to encrease or amend it.</p>

What letteth now, but that we may come to the last fruite of an effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which consists in the speciall duties which wee are bound to do, and performe towards others, in respect of some degree which is of God put vpon vs, or them, and so to finish this our worke?</p>

                     </gap>, through the wisedome of the Word; and surely such happy men, are all godly men: for as it is saide of <hi>Dauid,</hi> in respect of his warring against the Philistines, that he behaued himselfe wisely;
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:3215:217"/>
so it may be saide of euery true Christian, in regard of their spirituall warfare, that they wisely behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in it: which cannot be saide of vnregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who haue many of them knowledge to see gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally what ought to be done, and not done; but they lacke the wisdome which should gouerne them in their particular actions, according to the due circumstances, as they may please God in all their duties. The children of this world, excell the children of light in worldly wisedome; but in wise walking before God, the children of light excell the worldlings: whereof not one hath this true godly wisedome, howsoeuer cleare-sighted they be in matters of their owne credit and gaine. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath any worldly man the blessed gift of honesty, albeit they may doe many things which be honest, and be reputed honest by men of the world, because they doe such ciuill workes as honest men doe; yet they are destitute of Christian honesty, which is a fruite of the<note place="margin">Honesty.</note> Spirit, a companion of godlinesse, a quality of a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified heart, disposed so to practise all duties towards their Neighbour for Gods sake, as they be very carefull not to hurt them by doing any vncomely filthy or wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thing in their presence or knowledge: therefore the true Christian man, hee is the onely honest man; yea, and he alone may be saide to haue an honest heart, an heart firmely resolued to be that in truth, which he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the gift of Vertue is proper to an elect man, who be blest of God with a speciall valour, courage, and strength of mind, whereby they can ouercome hard things, and attempt great workes with good heart; for the spirit of fortitude and vertue is in them, so as they
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:3215:218"/>

Neither doth<note place="margin">Zeale.</note> any vnregenerate man partake in the gift of true zeale; for howsoeuer many of them are zealous and seruent, yet they are zealous amisse: either they are earnest in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their owne opinions, and of mens traditions, as were the blind Iewes, and <hi>Paul</hi> being yet a Pharisie; or if their zeale be for good things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded of God, or against euill things forbid by him, yet either it is not according to knowledge, as in those which were seruent for the righteousnesse of the Law, to set it vp, and to pull downe the righteousnesse of Christ; of whom the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>I beare them witnesse they haue a zeale, but not according to knowledge:</hi> or if they doe know what they do, yet their striuing for knowne good things, and against knowne euill things, is neither in a good manner, nor to a good end; as it is written of <hi>Iehu,</hi> that he was zealous for the Lord of hosts: but yet his heart was not aright, hee sought not Gods glory, neither was his heart touched with loue and compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards men. And thus it is with the zeale of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall men, it is both blind and bitter; but it is otherwise with the zeale of regenerate persons, which is tempered with charity, and guided by knowledge. The zeale of the righteous maketh them earnest against knowne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill things, to hinder them, and against knowne good things to further them, according to their meanes and calling; so setting before their eye onely the glory of God, as the marke they aime at in all their zealous courses; as they haue a charitable respect of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,

                  <p>Nay friend <hi>Aquila,</hi> I thought of those foure graces, but you haue bestowed them in a good place; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because better late then neuer (as we say) but because amongst common duties they are somewhat more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall then the rest; and therefore well singled out, and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:3215:219"/>
set apart by themselues. And now let vs consider of such graces as enable our elect and called Christian to discharge such duties as hee ought to doe, by reason of his degree and particular calling wherein God hath set him; for hitherto you haue dealt in such gifts as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the generall vocation of a Christian.</p>

                  <p>Sir, it is a thing commonly taught vs, that euery Christian besides his calling of Christianity, common to him with other, hath also a particular person put vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him; yea, sometime one Christian beareth many and sundry persons, being both an inferiour, as a child, or seruant, subiect, hearer, souldier, wife, maide, or daughter; and being also a superiour, as Father, Prince, Magistrate, Mistrisse, or Mother, Captaine, or Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or Iudge. Now this charge lyeth vpon euery Christian, and such grace is giuen them, as that they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to answer, and in some good measure can both know, and answer these duties, expressing and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the power of all that godlinesse which they haue as Christians, in that particular, or in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> particular pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wherein they are seated and setled of God, and that with all diligence, and sidelity; vprightnesse, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy. The wife giues reuerence and submission to her husband, in respect of his prehemmence in graces and authority; <hi>Ephesians</hi> 5 verse last; the husband loueth his wife as a daughter of Israel, and member of Christ, and out of this holy affection of loue careth for her; I <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 7. beareth with her infirmities, cherisheth, instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth her, and protecteth her. Fathers are not bitter to their children, but in mildnesse &amp; wisedome bring them vp in the instruction and nurture of the Lord; <hi>Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> 6. 3.
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:3215:219"/>
Children doe loue, reuerence, obey their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents for the Lord, <hi>Ephesians</hi> 6. 1. witnessing their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour towards their Parents, especially in this, that they make no choyce of their trades, and matches, without their priuity and counsell. Seruants not out of feare with eye seruice, but in singlenesse of heart study to please their bodily Masters; <hi>Ephesians 6. 5. 6.</hi> and these againe are willing to doe that which is equall and iust, both touching the bodies and soules of their seruants, knowing that they also haue a Master in Heauen; <hi>Calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> 3. verse last. The Pastor feedes his flocke, not for filthy luker, nor by constraint; 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4. but out of a willing minde, shewing himselfe an example to the flocke. The flocke and people on the other side acknowledge him, and haue him in singular loue for his worke sake; I <hi>

                     </hi> 5. The Magistrate kindly tendreth his inferiours, as his children; <hi>Iob</hi> 29. and mildly ruling with iustice, giueth praise to such as doe well, and punisheth those that doe euill; <hi>

                     </hi> 13. 2, 3, 4, 5. And finally, inferiours and subiects obediently submit themselues vnto their Rulers, as vnto Fathers, doing with readnesse their iust commandements, and with patience bearing euen their vniust punishments. Thus haue I giuen you a certaine taste of these singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and speciall duties; for neither time, nor your infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity wil permit vs more largely to discourse them: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this I thinke good to adde, that it is the property of all sauing graces which wee haue named, and of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which we haue forgotten (for who can remember all) to waxe and encrease, till they come to perfection; as the young fruites groweth till they be ripe: it pleasing God to follow his first graces with new supplies, till he
