            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Adame, when I had ferre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through euerie nooke of my Muses poore treasurie, to find some present worthy your acceptaunce, J coulde finde none so fitte, as this little <hi>Treatise of health,</hi> whose happie continuance, with faire increase of yeares, and plenteous fruitfulnesse, I haue euer wished you; that as the dewe of heauen hath sent forth the
<pb facs="tcp:5658:3"/>
bud of your tender age sweete, vertuous, and right worthie of the noble roote, from whence it sprang: so the sunne shine of grace will ripen those excellent blossomes to perfection. The first occasion, which made me fall into this kinde of studie, was the necessarie regard of mine owne health; necessarie I call it in diverse respects: for when sorrow and discontentment had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most dryed and stifled vp my vitall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites (the reasons whereof are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither to you vnknowne) and driuen mee to this dolefull exigent, that I doubted, which were better eyther to be, as then I was, or not to be at all: at the last, Reason and Religion forced mee to take this course, least despaire should ouerwhelme the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and purer faculties of my soule. Now, since the length and processe of time by fauour of the great Prince of Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, hath somewhat enlarged and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb facs="tcp:5658:3"/>
my spirites, I haue sent you no other Physicke, then what I my selfe applied, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, that it may lie by you without occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of vse, euen so long, that the leaues may lacke renewing, before you lacke health.</p>
            <p>Whereto although it may be, that some close and subtell-headed petifogger may except, yea, and sue my conceipt in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer of his owne opinion, in that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing sayth to <hi>Iustinian,</hi> doe enter league with <hi>Galen,,</hi> and studying the Ciuill law, doe vndertake to meddle with <hi>Naturall and Artificiall experiments:</hi> yet my plea shall bee drawne from a principall <hi>Maxime</hi> in Nature, namely, that my health is of more consequence with me, then my Clientes case, and my friendes beeing well more reioyceth me, then the worlds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rich. But how can you doe amisse (deare sister) for whom such carefull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb facs="tcp:5658:4"/>
and such a circumspect husband, haue so carefully and circumspectly proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? How can you (for whom Nature, Fortune, and worship, haue, like vnto the Poets three Goddesses, reserued the golden ball) how can you, I say, want all health, and happinesse, which this earth affoordes? Nay, more, how is it possible, that you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made your selfe hitherto deare to God (as appeares by his wonderfull bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites on you bestowed) by your vertuous conuersation in the verie Aprill of your yeares, be without the sauing health of ioy and glorie from aboue? What Direction neede you to respect, that are entered the right path? Truly, my prayers are, that you may proceed forward still in that way, but yet that you may bee lang in going; both that I may long enioy part of your felicitie, and also that other Ladies of the like sympathie of naturall inclination may
<pb facs="tcp:5658:4"/>
take president from your example.</p>
            <p>It greatlie befitteth your vertuous and ingenuous nature to reioice in the blessings of the Lorde so inestimable; as first, in your noble minded father, that famous Knight, sir <hi>Gelly Meiricke,</hi> (who for integritie of life, prudence, magnanimitie, and liberall behauiour, is inferiour to no man of what qualitie soeuer): and no lesse in the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with such an Husband, whom bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly regarde of modestie forbiddeth me to extoll with praises according to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts. And when the thirde blessing by the fauourable permission of one and the same God shall betide you, euen the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of children, as blooming vines round about your table, with both your powers equallie endued to your earthlie comfort: J know not to whome J may say, that the type and title of equall happinesse hath beene graunted more then vnto you.
<pb facs="tcp:5658:5"/>
But leauing these, and whatsoeuer other blessings it hath pleased the supreame Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of all goodnesse, to raine downe vpon you, as vpon a gratefull and fertill soile: my onelie purpose and intent is to request you (Madame) to patronize, and receiue with good liking, this pamphlet of mine, fraught with Naturall and Artificial Directions, as vndertaken for the health of all: so especiallie consecrated vnto your sutable tuition and seruice in particular, not so much (I protest) in regarde of anie your vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent neede, through anie distemperature, which I know; as to prescribe vnto you a dietarie plat-forme, whereby you may keepe backe all such griefes, as might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case steale vpon you here after, before you be aware: withall assuring my selfe, that in the often reading thereof, you shall get a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie stored with pretious Margarites, Rubies, and Diamonds; and in the vsing
<pb facs="tcp:5658:5"/>
of it, you shal find comfortable medicines, to prolong your life. Which the first and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Breather of life confirme and furnish with religious ornaments, and necessarie complements thereto belonging, while it remaineth in this earthlie mould; and after death make you partaker of those trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant and euer-during ioyes, which before the foundation of the worlde his Diuine Maiestie hath prepared for his Godlie and adopted children.</p>

                  <p>That, which is a mans natiue and countries aire, is best. This by the Philosophers is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued in this principle: Euery mans naturall place preserueth him, which is placed in it. And by the Poet confirmed:</p>

In briefe, a man in such cases must get him a nosegay composed of Roses, Violets, Maioram, Marigold, and such lyke.

                  <p>First, you must chuse out a fine soile, which hath water and wood annexed vnto it, and forecast in your minde whether the prospect too and fro be decent and pleasaunt to the eye. For I am of this opinion, that if the eye be not satissied, the minde cannot be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: if the minde be not pleased, nature doth abhorre: and if nature doth abhorre, death at last must consequently follow. Next, you must marke, whether the aire, which compasseth the situation of your house, be of a pure substance, and that, shortly after the sunne is vp, groweth warme; and contrarily groweth cold, after the sunne is set. Thirdly, you must make your foundation vpon a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell ground mixt with clay, vpon a hill, or a hilles side. Fourthly, looke that your win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes be Northward or Eastward.

                  <p>Exercise is that, which maketh the body light, increaseth naturall heat, and consumeth superfluous humours, which otherwise would clotter and congeale within the body. For in euery concoction some excrements are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred, which being left alone may be the rootes of diuerse sicknesses. Now the thicker sort of excrements are auoyded by sensible euacuations. But the thinner may be wasted and purged by exercise.</p>

                  <p>It is best to exercise, when the body is fasting and emptie, least after meates by violent and vehement motions digestion be hindred, and putrefaction follow. In sommer, exercise is to be vsed an houre after sunne rising, for feare of a double heat. In spring and haruest time it is to be vsed about an houre and a halfe after sunne rising, that the morning cold may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded. For as the heat at midday is hurtfull: so the morning cold, especially in Autumne is to be eschewed.</p>

                  <p>Walking, if it be not too slow, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable exercise, and may be vsed in hot monethes, specially of cholerick persons. To hang by the handes on any thing aboue your reach, so that your feet touch not the ground, is good. To climbe vp against a steepe hill, till you pant and fetch your breath often with great difficultie, is a fit exercise to be frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in cold seasons. Old men must content themselues with softer exercises, least that the small heat, which they haue, should be spent.

                  <p>The cause of loue among fooles is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; but among good men the vertues of the minde are the principles of loue, for they are euerlasting; and when all other things, as beautie and riches do decay, yet they become more fresh, more sweet, and inestimable then before. Hence is it that wee are counselled to chuse wiues, not by our eies, but by our eares; that is, not by prying into their faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of bodies, but by inward contemplating of their honest deedes, and good huswiueries.

one of which, one of the seuen planets is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant. The first age is called infancie, which continueth the space of seauen yeares. And then the Moone raigneth, as appeareth by the moist co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of children, agreeing well with the influence of that planet.</p>
                  <p>The second age, named childhood, lasteth seauen yeares more, and endeth in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of our life. Ouer this age, Mercurie (which is the second sphere) ruleth; for then children are vnconstant, tractable, and soone inclined to learne.</p>
                  <p>The third age endureth eight yeares, and is termed the strippling age: It beginneth at the fourteenth yeare, and continueth vntill the ende of the two and twentieth. During which time, gouerneth the planet Venus: For then we are prone to prodigalitie, gluttonie, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, lecherie, and sundrie kindes of vices. The fourth age containeth twelue yeeres, till a man be foure and thirtie, and then is hee named a young man. Of this age, the sunne is chiefe Lord. Now a man is wittie, well adiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, magnanimous, and come to know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>

                  <p>The seauenth and last (by order) of these ages continueth full eighteene yeares, ending at fourescore: to which few attaine.

                  <head>Why did men liue longer before the stoud, then they doe now.</head>
                  <p>The principall reason, why men in those dayes liued longer, then wee doe, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had not then any of the causes, which inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der in vs so many maladies, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce consequently ensueth death.

                  <p>Wee must also vnderstand, that our first parents were created of God himselfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other instrumentall meanes. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the earth in those dayes was of greater efficacie to bring foorth necessaries for mans vse, then it is in this crooked and outworne age.

                  <p>To conclude, they knew the hidden vertues of hearbs and stones, vsing great continence in their dyets and behauiours. They were ignorant of our delicate inuentions and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied compounds. They knew not our dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie cates, our marchpanes, nor our superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous slibber sauces.

To die once, is a common thing to all men. For that was ordained as a punishment of God for our foreparents, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his commaundement, touching the fruit in paradise: but to tel how, and at what time, that is a secrecie neuer disclosed to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Such as the mans life is, such is his death. A righteous man dieth righteouslie. But a wicked man hath a wicked ende.

                  <p>For which consideration, O mortall men, lead your liues vprightlie, hearken not vnto the counsells of the vngodly, nor like greedie Cormoraunts snatch vp other mens tightes.

The reason is, because then the course of the planets returne to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, who most commonlie is cruel and noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some vnto vs. And euen as the Moone, which is the next planet vnto vs, &amp; swiftest of course, passeth almost euerie seauenth daie into the contrarie signe of the same qualitie, from whence she came forth, and therehence brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the criticall daies: so Saturne, which is the planet furthest from vs and slowest of course (for he resteth in one signe so manie yeares, as the Moone doth daies) bringeth these climactericall yeares, &amp; causeth sundrie mutations to follow. Hence is it, that in the seauenth yeere children doe cast and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their teeth. In the fourteenth yeere proceedeth the strippling age. In the one and twentieth, youth. And when a man hath past seauen times seauen yeares, to weet, nine and fortie yeares, hee is a ripe and perfect man.

Now a man must eate lesse, and drink somewhat the more. The best meats to be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are veale, kid, yong mutton, chickens, drie fowle, potched egges, figges, raisins, and other sweet meates: and because the spring is a temperate season, it requires temperature in all things.

Summer begins, when the sun entreth the signe of <hi>Cancer,</hi> which is the twelfth daie of <hi>Iune.</hi> In this time choler is predommant, heat increaseth, the winds are silent, the sea calme, fruites doe ripen, and Bees doe make honey. Now a man must drink largely, eate litle; and that sodden: for rost meat is drie. It is daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous taking of Physick, and speciallie in the dog dayes.

For which cause, such things as breede melancholy are to bee auoyded, as feare, care, beanes, old cheese, salt beefe, broath of colewoorts, &amp; such like.

Therefore a man must vse warme and drie meates: for the cheerefull vertues of the bodie are now weakened by the cold aire, and the naturall heate is driuen into the inward partes of the bodie, to comfort and maintaine the vitall spirites. All rost, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or fryed meates be good; and so are boyled beefe and porke. Veale agreeth not, except it be well rosted. Also wardens, apples, and peares may be vsed with wine or with salt for swelling, or with comfits for windinesse. Beware least the cold annoy your bodie.

Also, who someuer hath any of these well prepared may helpe all the diseases of mans body, whether they be curable or vncurable. Reasons I neede not alledge, for that which is openly seene with eyes, need no proofes. It is an absurd thing, to be ignorant in that which euerie man knoweth. Is not the falling sicknesse one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured by the spirit of vitrioll? doth not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie heale the French poxe and the filthie scabbe? doeth not oile of antimonie plucke vp at once the impurities of the feuer?

that mans vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding can bring these inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our works to so great perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: without doubt it is the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god, that learning in this latter &amp; rotten age should wax lightsom: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d life (which otherwise through the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tagion of the world would soone decay) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these new &amp; strange maladies, which are in all places very rife &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon: so that the saying of that great prophet is now verified &amp; come to passe; my age shal renew it selfe like an Eagle.

The vertues of this water are these; it comforteth the spirites, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth the youth of man, it helpeth old goutes, the tooth-ache, the palfie, and all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases proceeding of cold: it causeth barren women to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue, it cureth the cold dropsie, the stone in the bladder &amp; in the reines of the backe, it healeth the canker, comforteth the stomacke, &amp; prolongeth a mans life.

This wine comforteth the braine and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, expelleth melancholy, breaketh the stone, prouoketh appetite, reuiueth weake spirites; and causeth a man to wax younge and lustie.

I will: first of all in the morning when you are about to rise vp, stretch your self strongly: for thereby the animall heate is somewhat forced into the outward partes, the memorie is quickned, and the bodie strengthned. 2.

Euacuate your selfe. 4. Put on your apparel, which in the summer time must be for the most part silke, or buffe, made of buckes skinne, for it resisteth venime and contagions ayres: in winter your vpper garment must be of cotto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or friezeadow. 5. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled your selfe handsomely, combe your head softly and easilie with an Iuorie combe: for nothing recreateth the memorie more. 6. Picke and rub your teeth; and because I would not haue you to bestow much cost in making dentifrices for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: I will aduertise you by foure rules of importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce how to keep your teeth white and vncorrupt, and also to haue a sweete breath. First wash well your mouth when you haue eaten your meate: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, sleepe with your mouth somewhat

open. Thirdlie, spit out in the morning tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which is gathered together that night in the throate: then take a linnen cloth and rub your teeth well within &amp; without, to take away the fumositie of the meat and the yellownesse of the teeth. For it is that which putrifieth them and infecteth the breath. But least peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture your teeth become loose &amp; filthy, I will shew you a water farre better then pouders, which shall fasten them, scoure the mouth, make sound the gums, and cause the flesh to growe againe, if it were fallen away. Take halfe a glassefull of vineger, &amp; as much of the water of the masticke tree (if it may easilie be gotten) of rosemarie, mirrhe, masticke, bole Armoniake, Dragons herbe, roche allome, of each of them an ounce: of fine cinnamon halfe an ounce, and of fountaine water three glassefulles; mingle all well together, and let it boile with a smal fire, adding to it halfe a pound of honie, and taking away the scum of it, then put in a little bengwine, and when it it hath sodden a quarter of an houre, take it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fire, and keepe it in a cleane bottle &amp; wash your teeth therewithall as well before meate as after; if you hould some of it in your mouth a little while, it doth much good

to the head, and sweeteneth the breath. I take this water to be better worth then a thousand of their dentifrices. 7. Wash your face, eyes, eares &amp; handes, with fountaine water. I haue knowne diuers students which vsed to bathe their eyes only in well water twise a day, whereby they preserued their eyesight free from al passions and bloudsheds, and sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their memories maruaylously. You may sometimes bathe your eyes in rosewater, fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell water or eyebright water, if you please: but I know for certaintie, that you need them not as long as you vse good fountaine water. Moreouer, least you by old age or some other meanes doe waxe dimme of sight, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto you, the best and safest remedie which I knowe, and this it is: take of the distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led waters of verueine, bettonie, and fennell one ounce and a halfe, then take one ounce of white wine, one drachme of Tutia (if you may easily come by it) two drachmes of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garcandy, one drachme of Aloes Epatick, two drachmes of womans milke, and one scruple of Camphire; beat those into pouder, which are to be beaten, and infuse them together for foure &amp; twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty houres space, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> straine
