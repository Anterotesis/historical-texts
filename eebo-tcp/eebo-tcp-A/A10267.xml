            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

who ere thou art,
That with an obvious eye
dost happen to peruse these lines,
taxe not my quill
whose zeale commands a taske
which may incurre
the censure of officious Partiality;
excuse that hand
which rather seekes to ease a heart
burthened with a faithfull griefe,
then
to magnifie his name
whose owne deserts
require no other Herault
than popular Report;
no other Plaudit
than the voyce of heaven and Angels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15894:5"/>His family,
If Antiquity may chalenge honour,
receivd it
before the martiall Drum
of the victorious <hi>Norman</hi>
left
to beat his conquering marches
in this glorious Island:
but,
birth nor blood,
nor what his Ancestors have done,
can chalenge ought
in him
that might redeeme his Name
from dull oblivion,
had not
his undegenerate actions
out-spoke his long-lin'd Genealogie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15894:6"/>His youth
Had all advantage of education
which
Carefull parents could contrive to give
and
a sweete ingenuous disposition could take;
bred
in the illustrious Academy of
<hi>Cambridge,</hi>
and
the honourable Society of
the Innes of Court;
wherein
He suckt such literature and manners,
as seasond his youth, and ripned his age;
to the honour of the Church,
to the good of his Country,
to the glory of his Family.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15894:6"/>He was
The faithfull husband of three wives;
the first
<hi>Esther;</hi>
the daughter of
Sir <hi>Edward Lewknor,</hi>
in the County of <hi>Suffolke</hi> K<hi rend="sup">nt.</hi>
the second,

the third,
<hi>Mary;</hi>
the daughter of
<hi>Henry Parvish,</hi>
of the City of <hi>London,</hi> Esquire,
a true and faithfull Mourner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15894:7"/>His
obedience to authority
gave him
Authority to command;
and his
Gentlenesse in Commanding
made him a necessary Commander:
wherein,
he so wisely compounded
Severity and Clemency
to the making up of true Iustice
both
Commutative and Distributive,
that
the very mouth of malice
was muzl'd at his Actions,
not daring to impeach
The uprightnesse of his Civil Govenment:</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15894:7"/>There was no
Morall vertue,
wherein he attained not
to high Perfection;
which,
like a rich perfume,
breathd so much sweetnesse into his name;
and,
like a diademe so crownd his dayes
with
Honour and Opinion,
that timerous vice,
not daring to approach his sight,
would stand and blush,
or shrinke away,
and seeke a safe protection
From those false hearts that lov'd him not.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:15894:8"/>Hee
was a friend
to all goodnesse and to all that lovd it:
faithfull
without ends;
constant,
without suspition;
loving,
without dissimulation:
his words
were the exposition of his thought;
his actions
were the confirmation of his words:
in respect of which,
he was neither apt to
glory nor upbraid;
Excusing defaults, without Censure:
Acknowledging deserts, without detractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15894:8"/>The two
great Pillours
which supported and maintaind
his
<hi>Oeconomick</hi> government,
were,
Piety and Hospitallity;
wherein,
Sobriety so moderated Plenty,
that
Men and Angels
were equally refresht at his repasts,
sweetned with the
<hi>Symphony</hi>
of
a chearefull and a charitable heart;
seasoned with the
musicke
of conjugiall Harmony.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15894:9"/>He was
the faithfull servant
of two illustrious Princes,
<hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Charles;</hi>
in whose acceptable service
He
so demean'd himselfe
in
Humility, wisedome, and fidelity;
that his
knowne faith
still rectifyed him in the gratious eye
of popular Opinion;
whose loyalty
Could have no greater Evidence
than
a smiling Conscience,
and two soveraigne Princes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15894:9"/>The
true sincerity of his Religion
had, but sought not
the applause
of men;
who,
pressing on towards the high Reward,
both in his practise and profession,
neither blusht nor bosted:
He was
the Orphans father;
the Oppressors Enemy;
the poore mans Advocate:
apt
to forgive, and willing to be forgiven:
Zealous without faction;
Charitable without ostentation;
Orthodoxe, without superstition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15894:10"/>His brest was
a Cabanet of

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iety, faith, and compassion,
whose
carefull keeper was,
a true <hi>Nathaniel,</hi>
In whom there was no guile:
He was
the master of his
word, wealth, and passion;
Lord
of his Affections
both
Concupiscible, and irascible;
curbing
all extremities with Prudence;
conquering
all adversities with Patience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15894:10"/>His life
was a happy continuation
of
well spent houres,
devoted to
the glory of God, the good of his country;
the service of his Prince;
wherein,
his
Piety, Iustice, and Fidelity
proposed him
an example
to all that would desire the love
of
God and Man,
and purchase to themselves
the underpriz'd Inheritance of
an honourable name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15894:11"/>His death
was
the Confirmation of a well led life,
being
the other moity of his happy story;
wherein,
he appeares just waight,
without the allowance
of the least graine
of flattery, or affection;
It was
the subject of his
Contemplation, Expectation, Preparation;
in respect of which, it was neither
strange, sudden, nor terrible,
but a welcome passage
from mortality, by corruption, to eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15894:11"/>And now
his blood-washt soule

triumphing
