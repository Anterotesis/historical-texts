            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in that I haue bin long vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly idle, and loath to lose the benefit of the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced intermission of mine accustomed former imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I could conceiue no fitter or better passe-time, then in this interim, to seek some inward consolation, in my outward discomforts: for the <hi>Second,</hi> I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that imparting these weake <hi>Meditations,</hi> vnto some seeming wel affected to the <hi>best things,</hi> I was incouraged to lay them down to the pleasure of the Printer; who, not without

examination &amp; allowance hath brought the same to publike view.

These, no fained excuses may, in honourable fauour, free me from the censure of rashnesse in attempting it, of presumption in publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and of neglect, or respect of persons in patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing it: So shall I think mine idle time not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lost, though gaining little outward profit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther happy or vnhappy, in gaining the one, or loosing by the other.

For, as there is in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man a double life, the one in this world, the other in another; the one perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the other permanent: so are men carnally or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinely qualified, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly bend their indeuors, to visible, or inuisible things &amp; are commonly most af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fected to things visibly seene, and sencibly felt, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, or heard. But as for


<pb facs="tcp:142:7"/>
inuisible things, few attaine to know them, much lesse to seeke them, least of all to enioy them. No, although their bodies bee ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with millions of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, &amp; their minds, with cares, griefs, &amp; infinite pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; which nothing can cure, or releeue; but some speciall inward spirituall working, yet seldome or neuer looke they vp aboue these earthly things; but in whatsoeuer outward, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hard estate they are, they seeke helpe here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if they finde it, they ascribe it, to the visible meanes and acknowledge them happie in finding it; in sicknesse to finde a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to heale them, in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie


<pb facs="tcp:142:7"/>
to haue a friend to enrich them, is imputed happinesse: how much more happinesse were it then for a man neuer to be sicke, to be rich, to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the eyes of all men, to be reputed the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest man in the world, and to enioy what his heart could thinke here? Would not all men admire this mans happinesse? And would not all men desire, and couet to bee in his like estate? And admit hee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto it, is this the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse he aymes at? No, hee must haue peace and long life to enioy it, else the very consideration of death, and to forgoe this faigned happinesse would


<pb facs="tcp:142:8"/>
be vnto him as if a sword hung ouer his head by the haire of a horse taile; eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie minute readie to fall on his head. Alas, what shall a man then so much strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and striue for the hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pinesse of this life, that consisteth onely of such things as the getting of them requires labour, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lies; the hauing of of them, enuie; the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them feare, and the losse of them sorrow? Which yet is not all: there must bee finally <hi>a redde rationem,</hi> an account; a fearefull reckoning; which, if men would dulie consider, in the time of their greatest supposed happinesse, it would make


<pb facs="tcp:142:8"/>
their hearts to tremble, and their knees to knock one against another like <hi>Balteshars,</hi> for feare of the infelicitie to come. If then the greatest happinesse that man can attaine vnto in this life, be thus accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, where is that true happinesse, that absolute felicitie finally promised? Such a happinesse there is, but what it is, no man can declare it; for <hi>the eye hath not seene it, the eare hath not heard, neither can it enter to mans heart, what God hath prepared, for those that loue him:</hi> But by examination of the chiefe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in man in this life can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute himselfe most happie, and comparing them with


<pb facs="tcp:142:9"/>
what things wee shall fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely enioy, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that mans happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse doth not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the enioying of good things, but in the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from euill things. The happiest man in this life hath causes of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, griefe and vexation of spirit, his life requireth labour, labour brings wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse; wearinesse couets rest, and rest presupposeth the bodies infirmitie; and consequently decay and death: And death prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth eternall saluation, the happinesse of the soule and bodie, or damnation of both. This is the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all men mortall, how happie soeuer hee

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:142:16"/>
the happiest man that is euen drunke with this worlds va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. Therefore doe the truely Wise passe by them, as it were disdayning to stoope to such deceiuing alurements stopping their eares with <hi>Vlisses,</hi> least these forbidden vanities should inchant them and with their seeming sweet infecting harmony, draw them to the gulfe of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for the vanities of this world bewitch the mindes of carnall men, who though they reade and heare their danger, it takes no impression in their obdurate hearts: they reade seldome, and heare, and vnderstand not; they yet know too much of that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the practice doth shew they are not <hi>wise to saluation,</hi> which indeed is, that absolute happinesse, that the truely Wise doe onely seeke; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:142:17"/>
that it auayleth them not, to gaine the whole world, and to take all the pleasures and delights of the same, &amp; to lose their owne soules.</p>
               <p>The best thing then, that we are to seeke to be happy, is to be assured in this life of the Kingdome of God, and our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to come, and to labour for the righteousnesse thereof; for if worldly men take so much paines for the getting of the vanishing things of this world, counterfeit happinesse, it may well be imputed, not onely as a shame vnto vs, but a iudgement vpon vs, if wee neglect, the absolute best thing, the saluation of our soules. And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts vs to the <hi>studie of righteousnesse</hi> and hatred of sinne, the contrary ends of both being set before vs; namely as touching sinne,


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:142:17"/>
wherein the best man hath once defiled himselfe, how much more the wicked? What fruit had they in it? Onely shame, and griefe, and in the end death eternall, without repentance, therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth vs now to cast off sinne, <hi>The vanities of the world, the lusts of the flesh, the pride of life,</hi> to which things whosoeuer is, or hath beene seruant, while he liueth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is <hi>free from righteousnesse:</hi> but now let vs seeke to bee freed from the seruitude of sinne. and to become <hi>seruants vnto God, so shall wee haue our fruit in holinesse, and in the end euerlasting life, which is the gift of GOD through Iesus Christ,</hi> which is the greatest happinesse that we can desire or attaine vnto, either in this life, or that which is to come; for the obtayning whereof,


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:142:18"/>
euery Christian is to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to auoide the vanities of this world, and the seruice of sinne in the same, indeuoring to become the seruant of God, which consisteth in an holy and heauenly conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, to which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the due and diligent hearing of God in his Word: and the true practise of the same, and faithfull prayer to him.</p>
               <p>By these two rules rightly obserued, a man becomes by acceptation perfect, and by imputation iust.</p>
               <p>To attaine vnto this degree of perfection and happinesse, it lyeth not in our owne powre; wee cannot heare without the Word preached, and none that heareth vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth; but he whose eares the Lord openeth. Carnall men may heare indeed, but


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:142:18"/>
not profit by hearing, vnlesse God open also their hearts, as hee did the heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> for both the Word, hearing, vnderstanding and practise are all the gifts of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prayer</hi> also is the gift of God, so is Gods Spirit, by whom wee pray, and faith in which we pray; and the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to obtaine that for which wee pray. How many men yet are there of conceit, that they can pray when they list, and how they list? as if earnest and truely cordiall prayer, were as familiar with them, as to tell a tale: Lipla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour babling indeed, is as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, as to speake any thing else. But this kinde of <hi>saying prayers,</hi> is not indeed prayer, but prattle, a mocking of God, and hee deceiueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that so speaketh prayers. A great man would take


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:142:19"/>
scorne to haue a tale told him, when hee that tells it speakes he knowes not what, his minde being vpon some other matter, will God then accept of those prayers, which onely are from the lippes, when the heart thinks of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse, then what the mouth speaketh? Their words may bee the words of holy prayer indeed, but if the heart consent not, nay, if the Minde, the Will and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Vnderstanding agree not with the mouth, though the words bee good, the prayer is counterfeit. True and feruent, faithfull and feeling prayer, will easily bee diserned from cold and counterfeit, for whereas a man may fluently without stoppe or stagger, powre forth many and good words, either by heart or booke, thinking


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:142:19"/>
that God hath enough, if hee haue many and good words, he cannot but acknowledge that he doth but flatter God, &amp; so commits sinne, instead of a sacrifice; But the prayer that pleaseth God, and profits a mans selfe, comes from the heart to the lippes, or the heart it selfe, sighes and groanes vnto God, in such vehemencie of spirit, as if not with outward teares, yet doth the heart rent it selfe within, through the feruencie of zeale, and power of a liuely faith, which kinde of prayer is effectuall, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to God</p>
               <p>It behooueth therefore euery man to be warie how hee prayeth, least <hi>hee offer the sacrifice of fooles,</hi> and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of being heard, to his comfort, hee be reiected with shame. Prayer consisteth not


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:142:20"/>
in the motion of the tongue, onely which is proper as well to the wicked as to the godly: But prayer is a diuine exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of a sanctified heart And therefore before we presume to approch into the presence of God with our Petition, we must duely and reuerently consider, to whom we speake, what we speake, and how we speake; wherein we may not consult with our owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies, and so vnsanctifiedly, to rush vpon the holy Throne of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> but with the Word of God, wherein is layde downe the persons, to whom, the manner, how, and the things for what we should pray.</p>
               <p>These things being vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, it behooueth vs also to looke into our selues, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this great worke of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine prayer bee within the

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was a man Diuine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualified, and yet hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth himselfe of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them that know not what to pray, as hee ought: what then? Should wee not pray at all, because wee know not how, or what to pray as we ought? God forbid, wee haue a promise that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God shall helpe our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and shall make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest for vs vnto God. How then can our prayers but bee heard and answered, seeing they proceed from Gods own Spirit, that dwelleth in vs?</p>
               <p>The truely faithfull in deed haue a promise, that if they open their mouthes, God will hil them And what is it but to assist them in their prayers? And therefore not euery one that seemeth to pray, prayeth


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:142:21"/>
in the Spirit, yet this promise may also appertaine vnto, and in time, be felt of them that yet want him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let euery man indeuour to be assured, that the Spirit of God is in him, which hee shall finde by the feruencie of his heart in prayer; although he be not at all times a like power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in vs, but retires himselfe for a time, to make vs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the want of him, and to thirst the more eagerly for his presence againe, which euery faithfull soule exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in this diuine dutie, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently apprehendeth; for the Spirit by degrees, as it were, mooueth our dull spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and at length sheweth himselfe strong and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in vs, for when we finde a will, and an inclination to pray, though wee be dull, not able to open our mouthes,

               <p>Gods children are forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that they must suffer: <hi>He that will liue godly in Christ, must suffer affliction</hi>; yet by promise, not aboue their strength: for God putteth to his hand, to make their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den light, with a promise also of future comfort; and though their troubles seeme great and grieuous, faith in God maketh them more easie to them that suffer, then they conceiue that beholde them with carnall eyes.

Whereby it appeareth, that euery suffering, euen of the godly, is not glorious such as befall them for their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions.

               <p>Sathan cannot endure with patience, any that liueth in the true feare of God, to passe in so holy a conuersation, but that he will endeauour to ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish them, at least, seeking all

               <p>He saw that <hi>Iob</hi> serued God truly, &amp; that God was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall protector and refuge: therfore did he maligne <hi>Iob,</hi> &amp; tryed his vttermost infernall stratagems, to cause him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust God: he slew his dearest children, he raised the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> and others to rob him of his goods, hee brought vpon his person loathsome diseases, he drew vpon him extreame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie: when none of these could withdraw him from his

What greater affliction could befall a mortall man? yet in all this was not <hi>Iob</hi> vnfaithful, but depended still on God, knowing, that though God was pleased to permit Sathan to punish him in this so stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge a manner, God had his ende therein for <hi>Iobs</hi> good, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Sathans purpose: for where Sathans ayme and end was, to haue confounded <hi>Iob</hi> body and soule; God, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Sathans malice, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Iobs</hi> miseries, into vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable comfort heere, and future eternall saluation, and caused his story to be written, for our imitation of <hi>Iobs</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy and patience.</p>

A griefe it is of all griefes, especially vnto such parents as haue had, not onely, a fatherly, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious care of their holy edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: And their griefe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but bee so much the more, by how much the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes the parents, censuring them euill, by obseruing the vngodly liues of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

It is no maruel then, that a good man may haue euill children, who though hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate their bodies, cannot infuse grace and goodnes into their hearts; he can not frame their inclinations to vertue, further the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:142:93"/>
according to the counsell of the <hi>Preacher</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastes, Jn the morning sow thy seed, and in the euening let not thine hand rest, for thou knowest not whether shall prosper this or that, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both shall bee a like good.</hi> So should parents bee alike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, at all times to instruct their children with holy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell: for they know not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God haue appointed this or that time, or this or that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, to conuert them from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill to good: for as one drop often falling, descends at last to moisten the root of the tree: So time, and timely counsell, may mollifie the hardest heart, and reforme the peruersest mind: for as the wind bloweth when and where it listeth, and no man knoweth from whence it commeth; so may the Spirit of God come into the heart, when man thinketh least of it:


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:142:93"/>
therfore ought parents to pray earnestly, and often for godly liues of their Children; in whom, then if God haue any share, it will in time preuaile.</p>
               <p>The reason why the world is so ful of loose lasciuious &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brideled youth, is much in the euill examples of Parents, the want of the feare, &amp; neglect of the seruice of God; for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a father may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alter the nature of a son in good, or euill. For there is a kinde of ineuitable imitation in the son, of the fathers qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; If they be good, nature rebelleth against them, in the son, because it is corrupt; &amp; if they be euill, nature it selfe teacheth the son, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther docume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, how to resemble the father in euill.

                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:142:94"/>Another maine cause of Childrens lewdnesse, is too much lenitie in Parents, and too much libertie in Children, wherein idle doting and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish mothers, are commonly most guilty, who because they haue giuen their Children suck of their breasts, when th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What then? Shall the Parents beare the shame of their Children that kick against all good counsell, and will obstinately run to their owne ruine? No. But if Parents be totally remisse in wholesome counsell, &amp; erre in their example, in the eye of their Children, no maruell if they taste of the shame, and griefe, of, and for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>But least good men, men fearing God, hauing vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Children, to whom they haue done their best duties in their youth to teach them,

the way of godlinesse, and they depart from it, should be too much deiected, and cast downe through griefe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued for the wickednesse of their Children, let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that as they cannot make one haire black, that is white, no more can they make him good, that is euill: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they keepe them in awe that are wilfully rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, nor preuent them of confusion, that voluntarily seeke it. Foolishly vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, then are they that will taxe a good Father of an euill Childe (comming into shame, and deepest danger) with the error of his sonne, when as good Children are the gifts God in mercie to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and wicked ones a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, not so much to the Parents, as to themselues. Though euery man would

               <p>O Lord, what am I, the son of dust and ashes, that I should presume to come into thy presence, to seeke and desire felicity and happinesse, here in this wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse of so many vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, miseries, and troubles, as are among the children of men? As for me, Lord, thou knowest wherof I am


<pb n="227" facs="tcp:142:126"/>
made; thou remembrest that I am but dust, what happinesse therfore, Lord, can I look to obtaine here, where sinne dwelleth in my mortall body; and by sinne I offend, and displease thee, and in thy displeasure is death?</p>
               <p>O preuent me Lord, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from sinfull feeding my foolish mind with false felicitie, as to repose my happinesse in the things of this life, in health, riches, honour, beautie, carnall friends, worldly wisdome, pleasures, delights, &amp; ease, which are not worthy, in respect of true happinesse in deed, to bee the least e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed.</p>
               <p>Giue me therefore here,


<pb n="228" facs="tcp:142:127"/>
O Lord, euen in this life, an entrance into true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; send foorth thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and breath life into my dead soule; transforme me into thine own image, from glory to glory, by thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; withdraw me from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the vanities of this life: for as long as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the pleasing things of this world, I am farre from happinesse; and it lies not in my power to restrain my heart from that which naturally I affect: I cannot subdue the corruption of mine owne nature; but that which is impossible to mee, is possible with thee, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare therefore thy great power in mercy vpon me.</p>
               <p>I am by nature wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,


<pb n="229" facs="tcp:142:127"/>
&amp; miserable, and poore, and naked, a most vnhappy man; yet such is my blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that I see it not: I feele not mine owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happinesse, Lord remooue that darknesse from me, and graunt, that seeing, I may see mine owne errour; and in hearing I may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, and take the right way to felicitie; work faith in my heart, that I may taste how gracious thou art, in working in me a new heart, a new mind, and new affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, holy and heauenly, the beginning here of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse to come.</p>
               <p>Make mee to feele the peace of a good conscience; let my faith be seen through obedience vnto thee; let me

feele in my soule through faith the merits of thy Son, working the assurance of the remission of my sinnes, and assured hope of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying of my finall felicity, and endlesse happinesse in heauen.</p>
               <p>None are truly happy or blessed, but such as thou dost chuse, &amp; cause to come vnto thee; for none can come vnto thee, but whom thou callest, and they onely are iustified; &amp; whom thou iustifiest, them wilt thou glorifie; and whom thou glorifiest, are, and none else, truly happy.</p>
               <p>Carry me therefore, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Lord, carry me by the wings of thy mercy, and by the strength of thy fauour
