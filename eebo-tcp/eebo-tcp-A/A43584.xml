         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GOdly Ministers are ſtiled <hi>the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots and horſemen of Iſrael;</hi> theſe are the <hi>watchmen of the city,</hi> that give warning of danger, intercede with the Lord; and doubtleſs the Church of God muſt needs receive great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the removal of ſuch worthies. It is a ſaying of the Jewiſh Rabbins, <hi>Quando luminaria patiuntur Eclipſin, malum eſt ſignum mundo,</hi> when the heavenly luminaries are eclipſed, it's a dreadful preſage of approaching evil to this lower world. The Church in theſe parts hath been ſucceſſively bleſſed with famous Ministers, and gracious Chriſtians, whoſe praiſe is in the Churches of Chriſt; many whereof now ſleep in the Lord; yet through Gods wiſe care of the Churches ſucceſſion, not
<pb facs="tcp:62233:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>a few are yet left, as hopeful ſlips ſpring up in their room; on whom and the people ſurviving, I would here take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to drop a word of counſel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1.</hi> You that are like to ſucceed this old ſtock of Preachers, worn or wearing out, look to your planting into Chriſt; let your own Souls be duely built upon the right foundation; preſume not to be Ministers before you be Chriſtians; get experience of Divine Truths in your own Souls, and tranſcribe them in your dayly practice: Believe, repent, obey, your ſelves, or you will teach theſe things ſorrily and unconcernedly; whatever your gifts be, ſee you have ſincere grace, and dedicate your all to God; you ſerve an holy God, Christ, you preach an holy Goſpel, you have before you holy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, be you alſo holy in every change, in all conditions. <hi>Aarons</hi> ornaments ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied nothing, if <hi>Holineſs to the Lord</hi> was not writ upon his forehead in a plate of Gold: if you had profound Wit and Learning, tenacious Memories, brave Elocution, that you could ſpeak <hi>with tongues of Men and Angels,</hi> all is of no worth without Grace within, and
<pb facs="tcp:62233:3"/>univerſal ſanctity; one allowed ſin will worm-eat the goodlieſt trees, and blast the pleaſanteſt fruits; ſome Miniſters are eminent for one rare gift, others for other accompliſhments; all have ſome, few have all; ſome modest young men look upon themſelves as much behind others, are apt to be diſcouraged; my advice to ſuch is, to make up that defect in diligence, holineſs and in faithfulneſs; what Nature or Art denies, get a ſupply by Grace; Grace within, vigorouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, the aſſiſting grace of God ſetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in by faith and prayer; Be faithful to what you have, if you cannot attain to much: that's a brave ſaying of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and ſhall be my Motto, I deſire to be found a faithful Miniſter of Chriſt and his church, if I cannot be prudent or skilful: Let not weakneſs of parts diſcourage you; ſome ordinary men of low gifts, may honour God more than ſome famous learned Doctors: Be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in your Studies: daily improve your talents; you have more helps than your predeceſſors; give not occaſion of the complaint of that Hebrew <hi>Rabbi,</hi> that the Father had Plow'd, Sown,
<pb facs="tcp:62233:3"/>Reaped, Fanned the Wheat, ſet Bread on the Table, but the children have not a mouth to eat it; the greateſt Parts may ruſt away by idleneſs; but meaneſt grow bright and uſeful by diligent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement; the diligent hand with Gods bleſſing makes rich; but be ſure you keep humble: deſpiſe not, but reverence your forefathers; if you exceed them in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Learning in ſome points, its well if you fall not below the min real worth, as to the power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: read their lives in Mr. <hi>Clarks</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, (eſpecially this laſt Volume printed ſince his Death) and be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of your ſelves, and provoked to a holy Emulation in true piety and Zeal; get into a corner, and tremble to ſee your ſelves thus outſtript, and implore more Grace from Heaven.</p>
            <p>I have but a word to ſay concerning this Diſcourſe, the Life of this holy Man of God; I confeſs many diſcouragements lay in the way of this undertaking, not fit now to be named; the main was, That we were not capable of doing any thing worthy of him, and it's better do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, than not to purpoſe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

               </gap>hough it ſeemed difficult in the entrance,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62233:6"/>but with Gods bleſſing on his induſtrious proſecution, he ſound it feaſible and facile; but, <hi>nil invitâ Minervâ,</hi> that which is attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt heart, or without an adequate capacity, goes on heavily, and ſeldom ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the profeſſor of his Calling fit to manage it to purpoſe, or arrive at any eminency in it, becauſe it goeth againſt the grain; wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore did the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who brought their youth into a place where the Utenſils for all Callings were laid up, that making their choice thereof, each might have the Calling he had thereby choſen.</p>
            <p>And as his proficiency at School was according to his time, ſo divine grace did be times begin to reach and touch the heart of this our young <hi>Timothy,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.</note> who from a child had known the holy Scriptures;</hi> for at Twelve years of age the Lord dealt with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by ſome rays of illumination, and darts of conviction, which more effectually were faſtened in him by Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry after his fathers death; but from his firſt conviction he had much trouble upon his ſpirit, which he kept much to himſelf, and often retired into a corner, being aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that any one ſhould know of his heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grief: his Mother being a choice and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Chriſtian, often ſpake to him of Soul concerns, wept and prayed much for him. At a competent age his Father ſent him to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridg;</hi> he was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62233:6"/>in <hi>Immanuel</hi> Colledge, where notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his pious education, and hopeful impreſſions, before mentioned, he ſell off to vain companie, and looſe practices, (ſee the ſlipperineſs of youth!) to the great grief of his parents, and his own preſent guilt, and after bitterneſs in the review. There he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and commenced Batchellor in Arts before his fathers death; who being ſick, ſent for this his ſon to come home from <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg,</hi> but he came ſo late; that in, the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, as he approached towards <hi>Dedham,</hi> he met the people going from his fathers Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which had a very deep impreſſion upon him. God took hold of this occaſion more effectually to awaken his conſcience, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum him to his duty.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Angier</hi> was kept a ſeaſon at his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, followed his ſtudies, attended on Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> Miniſtrie; this Mr. <hi>John Rogers</hi> of <hi>Dedham</hi> was a mirrour and miracle of zeal and ſucceſs in his Miniſterial la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; it was wont to be ſaid, Come let's go to <hi>Dedham</hi> to get a little fire: he was Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturer there, and preached once on Lordsday, and a Lecture on the <hi>Tueſday,</hi> to which multitudes of people flock'd from the parts adjacent; and his plain preaching was bleſſed with a large Harveſt; however ſome expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and geſtures he uſed, would now ſeem indecent; yet the gravity of the man, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral reverence people had for him, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62233:7"/>them not only not offenſive, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very effectual; his taking hold with both hands at one time of the ſupporters of the Canopy over the Pulpit, and roaring hideouſly, to repreſent the torments of the damned, had an awakening force attending it. Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin,</hi> after Dr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> when he was a Fellow in Cambridg, and an eminent Preacher, much followed and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, occaſionally hearing Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> fell under ſuch convictions, that he after profeſſed, that he lookt on himſelf neither as a Chriſtian, nor a Preacher; one paſſage Mr. <hi>Angier</hi> hath oft mentioned, That Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> being called to Preach a Marriage Sermon, I think inſiſted on the Wedding garment; God did ſo ſet in with the word, that the Marriage-Solemnity was turned into bitter mourning, ſo that all the Miniſters that were at the Marriage were imployed in comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or adviſing, conſciences awakened by that Sermon. Oh Bleſſed eſpouſals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and Souls, ſuch ſorrow was better than carnal Laughter, and laid a ſolid foundation of Spiritual joy. A Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman that Travelled ten Miles to hear plain and powerful Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> being in great troubles of conſcience, deſired ſome conference with him; and after ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated her condition, telling long and ſad ſtories of her had heart, ſad ſtate, Gods wrath due to her, danger of dropping into
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62233:7"/>Hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the good old man, hearing all this, at laſt ſtarted up, and fetched ſome frisks on the floor, and cried out, God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, God be thanked; the Gentlewoman thought the old man mad, and was ſtrangely ſurpriſed to ſee him rejoyce in her ſorrow; But he knew what he ſaid, and rejoyced in that ſorrow, that was the ſeed-plot of ſo bleſſed an harveſt; for that Gentlewoman proved an eminent Saint, and a lovely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort in exile and tribulation to a very holy and eminent Miniſter of Chriſt, as her own ſiſter hath told me.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Angiers</hi> manner was, when he atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> Lecture, after Sermon, when others ſtaid, diſcourſed, diſpatched buſineſs, he for his part went home to his chamber, meditated, prayed, work'd the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon upon his heart for about an hour, and thereby imprinted it ſo laſtingly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his memory, that he never forgot many paſſages; and by that time the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly got home, he was ready to take his din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with them.</p>
            <p>He lived a ſeaſon at Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> houſe, who ſometimes put him upon praying in the family, which he performed with ſo much experience, humility, and tenderneſs, that Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> would often commend him, and ſay to his friends, this Mr. <hi>Angier</hi> will make a choice man in his generation. Another ſeaſon he was with one Mr. <hi>Witham,</hi> whom
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62233:8"/>I oft heard him commend as a great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and a witty man, of pregnant part, though not ſo ſucceſsful in his Miniſtry, as a neighbour Miniſter of far meaner abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; one being askt the reaſon, anſwered, there was too many for God to work by; I know ſome ſay it was Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the famous Mr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> on the ſame account; but I think I have heard it of the aforeſaid Mr. <hi>Witham:</hi> alluding to <hi>Gideons</hi> firſt Army,
<note place="margin">Judg. 7.2.</note> of which God ſaid, The People that are with thee, are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for me to give the <hi>Midianites</hi> into their hands; but to whomſoever it was applied, the leſſon is uſeful, to convince us of the Lords Soveraignty in owning or diſowning perſons Miniſtry; and his Wiſdom, leſt too much ſhould be aſcribed to man, and God ſhould loſe his Glory.</p>
            <p>After this, his dear Mother being ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of her ſons ſpiritual good, conſulted with her Chriſtian friends, how to diſpoſe of him; ſhe was one of a thouſand for grace, holineſs, charity; one paſſage I ſhall make bold to inſert, which he often mentioned, That ſhe would have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, if ſhe had not been called upon for any work of Charity, ſaying, ſhe would not have her hand out of a good work. Oh, the prayers and tears ſhe poured out for all her Children, eſpecially for this her ſon, not only becauſe he was her firſt-born,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62233:8"/>but chiefly becauſe he was devoted to Gods ſpecial work in the Miniſtry, and becauſe of his former backſlidings, and her jealouſy of him for the future; upon conſultation with friends, and begging of advice from God, ſhe being afraid to ſend him again to <hi>Cambridg,</hi> reſolved to ſend him to Mr. <hi>John Cotton,</hi> at <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> where he was Tabled; he ſtudied, and ſometime Preached; there he contracted an intimate friendſhip with thoſe three great Divines, Dr. <hi>Tuckney,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hill,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Winter;</hi> Mr. <hi>Anthony Tuckney</hi> was Fellow of <hi>Immaunel,</hi> and ſo continued a good while, till he was called to be Vicar of <hi>Boſton;</hi> he was a ſerious, ſetled good man before he went to <hi>Boſton,</hi> afterwards Maſter of <hi>Immanuel,</hi> and after that of St. <hi>Johns</hi> in <hi>Cambridg.</hi> And for Mr. <hi>Thomas Hill,</hi> Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> when Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> was Batchelour in Arts, intending to make him Fellow, ſent him to Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> for ſome time, and when he returned thence, choſe him Fellow, deſigning his ſetled ſeriouſneſs in Religion, before his Election; for which he thought Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> family might be a likely means, and ſo it proved: afterwards Dr. <hi>Hill</hi> was Maſter of <hi>Trinity-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> and Dr <hi>Winter</hi> Maſter of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity-Colledge</hi> near <hi>Dublin</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> all famous Lights in the Church of God; Mr. <hi>Angier</hi> ſurviving them all.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62233:9"/>
            <p>And by the way it will not be thought impertinent to digreſſe a little, in giving a few hints concerning Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and Worthy Man, though his life was at large written by a <hi>New-England</hi> Miniſter, and Mr. <hi>Samuel Clark</hi> after made ſome Collections out of it: yet ſome things Mr. <hi>Angier</hi> hath occaſionally mentioned of him to ſome of his Brethren. Though Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> was an excellent Text man, yet he would never deliver his judgment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſence of a Scripture, till he had firſt conſulted both the Original and Context; an excellent pattern: Mr. <hi>Angier</hi> hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times related to his intimate friends, that Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> never went into his Study when called out on any occaſion, but he began his Studies again with Prayer.</p>
            <p>A Reverend Miniſter ſaith, he Travelled with Mr. <hi>Angier</hi> when it hath Rained ſmartly; and he told him he had Travelled ſo with Mr. <hi>Cotton;</hi> and he hath asked him what uſe he would make of ſuch a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? he ſaid he took every one of thoſe drops as his Fathers Rod; and he uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his call, and to mind his work the more: this brings to my thoughts, a paſſage he oft told me of Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> comparing a good conſcience to a good Wiſe; if a man ride in a ſtorm and be ill wet, he will comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſay, When I come home I have a good
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62233:9"/>Wife, will make much of me, and bid me welcome home; ſo a good conſcience will make much of one after a difficult journey, and foul Way and Weather, in a perſecuting boyſterous World: and I was Travelling in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> with Mr. <hi>Angier,</hi> where the way was exceeding Deep and Foul; he told me what Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> uſed to ſay in that reſpect concerning the ſtate of good Souls; You in this level Countrey, ſaith he, <hi>i. e.</hi> in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire,</hi> in ſummer-time, when the ways are Fair and Dry, are apt to think and ſay, Surely this way will never be Foul and Dirty again; and in the Winter you think, when the ways are Deep and Unpaſſable, it's impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that theſe waies ſhould be dry again, or duſty; juſt ſo when God ſhines on the believers Soul with the Light of his countenance, he is apt to ſay, My <hi>mountain ſtands ſo ſtrong I ſhall never be moved;</hi> but God <hi>hides his face, then he is troubled:</hi> when God is withdrawn, oh, ſaith the Chriſtan, it will never be otherwiſe; but he lives to ſee things changed, the Sun breaks out from under a Cloud, and the black Clouds diſperſed, and ſo his ſtate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably cleared. Again Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that God made all turns in the world for comfort or correction to his own people, modelled all things to their condition and neceſſities.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:62233:10"/>
            <p>Thus much for the digreſſion concerning Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> which is not impertinent To return to Mr. <hi>Angier,</hi> whom w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At this time there lived in Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> Family, a gracious young woman, called <hi>Ellen Winſtanly,</hi> born near <hi>Wigan</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> Niece to Mrs. <hi>Cotton;</hi> and it pleaſed God to knit this Mr. <hi>Angiers</hi> heart to her, and hers to him, that within a year after he came thither, they were Married in the Pariſh Church at <hi>Boſton, April</hi> 16th. 1628. and they continued there till his ſon <hi>John</hi> was born, who was baptized in the

            <p>To this are 24 hands ſubſcribed; but the People of <hi>Denton</hi> having poſſeſſion, would by no means yeild; and Miniſters gave in their judgment, upon due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of circumſtances, that for the publick good of the Church, Mr. <hi>Angier</hi> ſhould continue at <hi>Denton,</hi> in which he was willing to acquieſce.</p>
            <p>As to Mr. <hi>Angiers</hi> judgment in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical affairs, in free times, as he had not turned aſide to conformity, on one hand, ſo now he ſtuck faſt and firm to found and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Principles, not turning aſide to any ways of ſinful ſeparation, though ſome of his intimate friends forſook him, and ſome of his brethren cenſured him for too large Principles and practices in Church-admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration: yet as he had a tender reſpect to congregational brethren; ſo they had (at leaſt many of them) a great reverence for him; he was a principal member of that Reverend Claſſe, (or Aſſociation of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) at <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and was of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62233:19"/>and uſe among them; ſuch was their eſteem of him, that they would ſcarce do any thing of importance without him, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes preſided as Chair-Man, or Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, frequently attended the provincial Aſſembly at <hi>Preſton,</hi> had ruling-elders in his own Congregation, but loved not divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principles, or diſtinguiſhing Names, or Lordly domineering by any Arbitrary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions: I have often heard him ſay, that in a little time, who ever lived, ſhould ſee much of the Government of Chriſt ſhould be carried on in particular Churches amongſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>He was of a Sweet, Moderate, Healing Spirit, both at home and abroad; yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faithful and plain dealing, whereby ſome were at preſent offended, and poſſibly ſome of his principles or actings ſuited not ſome perſons principles or humours; yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe entertained what he ſpake with high veneration; and if at any time they broke out into paſſions, or unruly animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, his love and lenity, his mild carriage and compaſſionate Spirit, did ſo mollify and qualify their Spirits in time, that they were either overcome to a compliance, or won to endeared apprehenſions of his candor and ingenuity: ſo that I have often thought of that paſſage of <hi>Melchior Adam</hi> one of the <hi>German</hi> Divines,
<note place="margin">Melch. Ad. <hi>in vit ger</hi> Th. p. 65.</note> as applicable to Mr. <hi>Angier;</hi> it was <hi>Schwebellius,</hi> that had

            <p>And for his judgment and practice in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and politick affairs, he was fixed in his apprehenſions for Monarchy, and was not wheeled about with the change of times; he was one of thoſe that bore his Teſtimony with the Reſt of his Brethren, againſt that unparallel'd murder of King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, and the Uſurpations attending it; he refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take up the ingagement, tho to his great prejudice, for he told a godly Miniſter that he loſt 200 <hi>l.</hi> by his refuſal of it. He durſt not give God thanks for the Armies ſucceſs againſt the Loyal <hi>Scots;</hi> he poured out many hearty prayers and tears for his preſent Majeſty, aſſerted his right to the Crown in the face of apparent danger; joyned with his Brethren in that ſolid plea for the Non-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers to the Engagement, which was (to be true and faithful to the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> as it is now Eſtabliſht without King or Houſe of Lords) for which they were threatened and endangered, till God broke that ſnare; ſome troubles both Mr.

            <p>At this time was the conception, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the birth of that excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Mr. <hi>Edward Gee's,</hi> then Parſon of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſton</hi> (and priſoner with them) about prayer; the occaſion whereof was this: Amongſt the reſt of the debates managed by theſe holy men, this was one great caſe of Conſcience, wherein they deſired ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether God may hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from his peoples prayers, grounded upon his promiſe, and ſeem by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences to anſwer the prayers which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereto? whether this can be paralleld with any examples? in what ſence God may do this? what may be the reaſon thereof? what uſe may be made of Gods proceeding herein? This multifarious queſtion being the proper ſubject of that day, and not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying themſelves in their preſent diſcourſes, they judged it fit to refer it to a ſuller diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion by ſome able pen, and pitched upon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62233:20"/>Mr. <hi>Gee,</hi> who undertook it, and writ an excellent treatiſe, which is extant, and of great uſe at this day.</p>
            <p>Other caſes of Conſcience did occur in that day, wherein Mr. <hi>Angiers</hi> advice was deſired; one was, Whether Juſtices of Peace or other Officers might take commiſſions from, and act under thoſe Uſurped powers?

He was an excellent Text-man, a ſolid Expoſitor; his way was, comparing one Scripture with another, wherein he had a ſingular art, ſhewing the main ſcope of the Holy Ghoſt therein, raiſing pertinent doctrins therefrom; though he had conſulted with Expoſitors (of which he had ſtore of choice ones) yet he made no oſtentation of his acquaintance with them by numerous quotations, but extracted the marrow out of them, and pitcht upon what ſemed to him moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>

               <hi>Angier</hi> was very ſolemn and grave in all his addreſſes to God, or in his deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meſſages from God: it was his uſual manner, before he ſpoke a word in prayer, to pauſe a conſiderable while, looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, compoſed his thoughts, poſſeſſing his heart with awful apprehenſions of the Divine Majeſty and by mental ejaculations imploring Gods quickning preſence; and after a ſeaſon he arrived gradually to a great degree of zeal and warmth in prayer, agonizing in the duty with ſweat and tears, which rendered his ſpeaking; at ſome ſeaſons both painful and difficult; yet was he not only made up of zeal and affection, but had proper and pertinent matter, exact method, and apt expreſſions: Mr <hi>Harriſon</hi> was wont to call him a ponderous man, for every word had its weight and emphaſis; he had no waſte words either in prayer or preaching, but as his affections were Boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62233:27"/>ſo his Words were few and well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>He did not uſe to be long in prayer, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon extraordinary occaſions, and then not tedious, becauſe variety of matter and patheticalneſs in the manner, rendered his prayers acceptable to the joyners; he propounded this Queſtion, Whether the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God did ordinarily dictate matter of prayer? he did conceive it might, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 26. <hi>the ſpirit helpeth, for we know not what we ſhould pray for.</hi> Yet he was far from <hi>Enthuſiaſm;</hi> nor was he altogether againſt forms of prayer, nor joyning in publick with the Liturgy, though he judged that inconvenient modes of worſhip muſt be our affliction, but may not be our ſin, when we are not in a capacity to remedy; nor did he think that meer preſence doth ſignify conſent or approbation of every thing we hear. As for the Lords prayer, his judgment was, that it was delivered chiefly by our Saviour as a pattern or platform of prayer, to which, (as to ſeveral heads) all our prayers muſt be referred.</p>
            <p>He ſeldom inſiſted long upon a Text (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when he took a Scripture before him) becauſe (as he uſed to ſay) a Miniſter may have frequent occaſion in the courſe of his

            <p>But the great affliction, the very accent and quinteſcence of his affliction, was the ſin and miſcarriage of ſome of his Children; this, this did cut him to the very heart, and lay as a continual preſſing load on his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; his Son, his only Son, devoted to God not only in Chriſtian profeſſion, but Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial function, miſcarrying under ſuch education, with ſuch aggravations, this went ſo near him, that ſuch words dropt from Mr. <hi>Angiers</hi> lips, of bitter complaint to one related to him, as ſhewed his heavy reſentment of ſome burdens of that nature; Tho he had paid for his Son 400 <abbr>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62233:41"/>was wonderfully maintained in his lot: he did not of late years preach that day he adminiſtred the Lords Supper; the laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-day, was <hi>Auguſt</hi> 12, 1677. and the next Lords-day after, he preached one part of the day, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 19. but when he came into his houſe, he laid his hand upon his breaſt, and ſaid, Ah, this will not do, I muſt give over preaching, (which yet cut him to the heart to think of) he was very weary that Night, as uſually he was; the next day but one after, he begun to have ſome Aguiſh fits, and had ſix or ſeven of thoſe fits; from that time he began to decline apace: when this his laſt ſickneſs begun, he ordered his kindſman in the houſe to write letters to Mr. <hi>Caſe,</hi> (his brother in law) Mr. <hi>Tuckney,</hi> his brother <hi>Bezaleel,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to acquaint them with his condition, hoping for and deſiring their prayers: he expected his own Sons coming dayly out of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> but he came not while he was living: he ordered his Son-in law to be ſent for, a meſſenger was diſpatched to him, but tho he haſted away towards him, yet he came not till this holy Man of God had breathed his laſt; a few hours before, on the ſame day, his approaching diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on came on apace, yet had he the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his underſtanding to the laſt; and as he had been a man of prayer all his days, ſo he died praying; that morning he died

            <p>The whole Nation and Church of God ſeem much clouded by the obſcuring of this bright ſtar, but eſpecially that congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Denton</hi> is ſadly eclipſed, their valley of viſion is at leaſt turned into a valley of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion; oh that it may not alſo prove a valley of treading down, and deſolation: Ah, what lamentation was there at his funeral! amongſt the reſt an ancient Chriſtian came from the grave into the houſe where the Miniſters were ſate after the funeral, with a trembling body, weeping eyes, and with a doleful voice of ſad complaints, ſaying, Ah ſirs, what muſt we do! what muſt we do! our loving paſtor is gone, our loving paſtor is gone: And now that good man is gone after, and many others, ſo <hi>John</hi> 4.36. <hi>he that ſowed, and they that reaped, are rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing together:</hi> but the ſad countenances

            <p>That Lords day when Mr. <hi>Angiers</hi> Corps lay in his houſe, two Miniſters preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Chappel, two funeral Sermons, the one ſeeming to be a funeral Sermon to the people, the other for their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
            <p>That which concerned the people car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried an ominous preſage of the death of their Goſpel priviledges, and Sunſetting of their glorious day, ſadly predicted from <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>My ſpirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man:</hi> and oh what a dreadful verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that text hath providence made there; that being the laſt Sabbath that excluded Miniſter injoyed the liberty of ordinances in that place.

                     <p>It ſhall not be troubleſom to me, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentful, if by the help of God I may reach forth any the leaſt help to you, or any friend of yours that deſires to guide his way right. I do pity your friends, fearing it might be an hour of Temptation to them, and a Cauſe of much Affliction, eſpecially if their affections be much engaged, which their living together ſpeaks; my advice in this Caſe is, That the Gentleman make uſe of ſome friend or friends to the Mother, that have intereſt in her, to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62233:50"/>gain her conſent, and if he have no tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eſtate equal to hers, or to add ſomething to it; yet to ſignifie that he ſeeks the party more than the Portion, and to offer this evidence of it, to give way that the Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be laid out for her uſe, and the uſe of Poſterity, if the Lord ſhew them that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. If Friends cannot prevail, the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may do well (and it a very hopeful way) humbly to deſire her Mothers conſent in her own Perſon; if by neither of theſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and due means, they can prevail; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they may be moved ſtill to pray, and wait upon the God of Spirits, who knows his own Counſels, and can ſecretly incline all Spirits to comply therewith. I cannot adviſe them to Marry without the Mothers conſent obtained, unleſs ſhe hath formerly ſet her at Liberty, and delivered her into her own Power. For 1. The Mother hath authority over the Child, as well as the Father, an authority of her own, a joynt-authority with the Father given of God, <hi>(Honour thy Father and Mother)</hi> an Authority founded by Nature; the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being a joynt-cauſe with the Father of the Childs being; and tho the Father be dead, and the Portion be in the Childs hands, according to the laſt Will, and his Authority be ceaſed; that takes not away the Authority of the Mother, which was included in the Fathers, but always diſtinct;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62233:50"/>and therefore ſome Wills in bequeathing a Portion to be paid at Marriage, do make the reaſonable conſent of the Mother a juſt condition. 2. It may be the Mother hath juſt reaſon to deny her conſent; amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the want of temporal means (i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that be wanting) which is a greater defect in Miniſters conditions, than uſually in others, becauſe they having large Spiritual means, and living at the height thereof, or beyond, their Wives at their Death fall ſo much lower than others, by how much they live higher; the Mother may ſay, She will provide a Match where Piety and Portion meet. 3. If the Mother ſhould unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably deny her Conſent; yet we muſt not run into that we have had ſo much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of, of later times, to right our ſelves by force and violence, but ſeek remedy in a regular way. 4. If the Mother be carnal, and they religious, they muſt be afraid to lay a ſtumbling-block before her; and tho the Scandal will not be ſo great, being to live in another Country; yet it will be too great, if to any, eſpecially if to a Mother, whoſe Souls good the Daughter is bound to pray for in a ſpecial manner, and to ſeek by all good means. 5. To Marry without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Mother, at beſt, is not a clear Caſe, but dark and doubtful, and will be an advantage to Temptation aſſailing ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſciences; whereby, if their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62233:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>be croſſed one in another, or God ſend Afflictions; their burden will be much increaſed, becauſe this Queſtion will ſoon be moved, Whether they did well to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry without or againſt Conſent? 6. If Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be left to their own Liberty; yet the Duty they owe to their Parents comfort, and the greater judgment and experience of their Parents, do juſtly challenge their humble deſires of their Counſel, their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Deliberation thereupon, and great unwillingneſs to Match without their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable conſent: Adviſe your Friends ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to conſider, whether they have not gone out of Gods way in ingaging their Affections mutually, before Conſent ſought; if the Lord ſhall help them herein to repent, it will be a foundation of after-Mercy; the truly Godly are apt to miſs it far in theſe occaſions; but Grace will not allow it, when God makes a diſcovery. Thus I have freely imparted my thoughts to you in this Caſe, beſeeching God to clear the paths of all his Servants, eſpecially his Miniſters, who are to carry the light before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I reſt</p>

                  <hi>(a)</hi> The matter of Scandal ſeems to ſtick moſt; and whether, if Providence diſpoſe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62233:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Miniſter in another Country, this may not be ſome relief to that, is queri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>He received the Opinion of others, as well as this, yet he took mightily with Mr. <hi>Angiers</hi> Counſel; for he ſaith, Upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of your Letter, and Mr. <hi>Angiers</hi> advice in it, <hi>To pray and wait upon the God of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who could ſweetly incline all ſpirits to comply with his counſels;</hi> Tho I had prayed dayly for it, yet I was put on upon a more earneſt begging that Mercy, in much more Faith and Hope, that the Lord will ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline ſpirits. And about a week after, he had the news that the Gentlewoman had by an humble Letter to her Mother, on this account, obtained, that the Mother did yield to leave her to her own diſpoſal.</p>
               <p>In a little time after he was ſetled a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in <hi>London,</hi> and Married, but ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell into a Fever, and into the Small pox, whereof he died; and particular Friends underſtood that he was ſeized with great Melancholy, and trouble, which (it was thought) killed him; and it was judged it was occaſioned by exceſſive travelling that had ſurfeited his Body; but if this matter of Conſent had been doubtful, what work would it have made with him in ſuch a condition? According to the prudent Suggeſtion of the fifth Reaſon in Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> Anſwer.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:62233:52"/>
               <p>This was the firſt Caſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Caſe was about Preſence at Common-Prayer, which I the rather inſert, to teſtifie his Judgment and Principle in that Caſe.</p>
               <p>The Caſe was repreſented from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Perſon to us, in theſe words, <hi>Jan.</hi> 10. 1662.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The grounds of my diſſatisfaction concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Common-Prayer,</hi> are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ineffectualneſs of forms upon my heart. Tho I do not deny the lawfulneſs of forms, nor Queſtion the experience of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this or other forms; yet I will ſay, That tho I have to the utmoſt endeavoured to benefit my ſelf by the ſeveral forms I have been neceſſitated to hear in publick and private; yet I could never get any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion made on my heart thereby, tho I have (as much as I could) removed preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; yet they have been ſo to me, as if I had had nothing; and this I have obſerved in my ſelf in ſeveral tempers of Spirit, as Joy, Grief, Fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay when my heart hath been in the beſt frame, and moſt ſenſible, then have they been worſt of all unto me.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to this form, my prejudice is ſo great upon ſeveral accounts, that I have no hope of good by it, as having been bred up under its plenty, and tired with its
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62233:52"/>emptineſs, and yet ſurfeited of it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it hath the ſame effect that ſuch meats have, on which we ſurfeit; which beſides nauſeating, neither have I had any good by it, but much hurt many ways.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I cannot hear it without ſin; when I have been ſurprized with it, it hath inſtead of ſtirring up Graces, raiſed Paſſion, and ſuch Anger, as hath forced me out of the place; and if it be Worſhip, it ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended upon as Worſhip, and the heart go along with it; which if it do not, muſt not be attended. I find upon the view of my heart at Night, that I have contracted guilt in my not joyning cordially in Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and getting good by it; and by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, increaſe my ſin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The influence that my intent of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, had upon my heart, which I ſhall relate ſomething of, tho ſhort of what it was. Being in another Country amongſt my Friends, I was ſomewhat troubled what to do; but the Miniſter being of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, tho I could not prevail with him to forbear it while I was there; yet he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me to read very little, which did pretty well ſatisfie me; but when I heard the firſt Bell in the Morning, I was ſomething ſad to think what a Snare I was come into; but when the next Bell gave notice, I (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſecret Duty) was carried on by ſuch trembling and terrors, with anguiſh of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62233:53"/>that I was forced from the Duty thereby ſtriving to ſatisfie my ſelf with arguing the Caſe; but the more I did ſtrive, the leſs I prevailed; my weeping and ſighing was ſo extream, that I thought my heart would have broke. Oh! how was I troubled that ever I ſet my foot out of doors to come to that place to ſin! nothing but ſin, and ſinful compliance, could I think it to be; and this was much ſet upon my heart, that if I did hear it thus, I ſhould never have peace in my Conſcience more; and the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that great loſs by ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inning againſt light, did much increaſe and aggravate my perplexity: I called in a godly kinſwoman, and ſhewed her of my trouble; we both conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, whether it might not be a Temptation, but could not find it ſo; ſhe ſaid if it were a ſin in me, my ſtaying from it would occaſion more; that the Lords day would be profaned by the wrath and bitter words of a Superior. But while I could get no ſatisfaction, they ſtayed for me; my neareſt Relation bad me never go, except I was better ſatisfied; ſeveral Meſſengers were ſent by ſome, that it ſeems would not go without me; ſo to ſatisfie them I went, but did not hear any of it; I wiſh it were (but it is not poſſible) for me with my Pen to expreſs what I felt in my Spirit in this half hour: No, my Tongue is not able to utter it, and ſtill its freſh upon my thoughts of conforming in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62233:53"/>this thing, its brought to my remembrance, I am (as it were) bid to remember my ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors at ſuch a place, on this account.</p>
               <p>All this put together, and duly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, theſe Queries I make.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether I ought to hear it, as ſome preſs, that it is a ſin to forbear? or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not ſinful in me to hear it? Or whether I may ſometimes, as ſeldom as I can (to avoid the penalties) hear? Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether upon theſe accounts of my forbearance, I may comfortably ſuffer what may be inflicted, and expect ſupport? Or,</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you grant the hearing, whether may it be heard as ſomething by the by, without giving much attention, or with imploying my heart with other thoughts and Ejaculations more edifying?</p>
               <p>Thus have I ſtated my particular Caſe, owning many Arguments that others uſe, keeping only to my own caſe, which may differ from others, not judging what's fit for others to do, or cenſuring them for what they do; and I ſhould never have put the Queſtion upon this, but upon 2. accounts. 1. Becauſe divers ſay, it is ſin not to go; and then my Caſe is ſad, that muſt ſin either way. 2. The other reaſon (which was firſt in my thoughts before I ever heard, or thought any would have held it a Duty to hear) whether I could comfortably ſuffer
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62233:54"/>in ſuch a cauſe? Thus I muſt ſay, I have not been without many ſerious thoughts about it (ſin I would avoid); Prayers and Tears, and not trouble, I find in my Spirit upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, tho I diligently obſerve, and I have ſuch a Conſcience that will not let me run on in the leaſt ſin, but would be telling me oft of it, without leaving me till I have left it, at leaſt, endeavoured and prayed againſt it; neither do I find any conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſtaying away; but the ſending, and waiting in expectation till that's done, and loſs of the Scriptures which I read at home, at the ſame time; that of ſeparation weigh not with me, it being not total, but only from that which is queſtionable with me, whether it be Worſhip, and coming to Singing, and publick Sermon, Prayer however, it is ſome comfort, that Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> calls them, <hi>Our Brethren of the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:62233:54"/>
                     <p>I do not apprehend any ſolid Argument to convince the Conſcience in the grounds of diſſatisfaction, concerning hearing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer mentioned in the Paper. Not in the firſt, ineffectualneſs of forms upon the heart. 2. No hope of good by this. 3. She cannot hear it without ſin. 4. The influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the intent of hearing had upon her heart. To make theſe firm grounds for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to reſt and act upon, muſt be proved, That ſet forms in their own nature are the proper cauſes of the grievances mentioned, which the judgment of this good Woman doth not deny in the firſt ground, <hi>viz.</hi> I do not deny the lawfulneſs of forms, and the Paper it ſelf doth clearly manifeſt their natural cauſes. I conceive therefore with ſubmiſſion, that there is much of ſtrong temptation in the Caſe propounded, which hath met with a double great advantage. 1. The Irreſolution of the judgment touching ſet forms, whether they be lawful or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, obedience or ſin; for tho there hath been ſome apprehenſions of lawfulneſs, as in the firſt ground; yet the reaſons have not been of ſuch weight as to bring the Scales of the Judgment to the ground in the caſe of lawfulneſs, and there to hold them; but they have been wavering, and by the ſtrong touch of diſſatisfaction to forms, the Scale hath been hurried down on the ſide of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs, and fixed there, which is the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62233:55"/>true cauſe of ſo great trouble mentioned, in and for hearing Common-Prayer. Becauſe the good Woman hath been drawn by ſome external motive to act contrary to the preſent Sentence of Conſcience, or at beſt with a doubting Conſcience, which makes an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lawful in it ſelf, unlawful to him that doth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5, 14, 19. The ſecond great advantage this temptation hath met with, is a ſtrong prejudice deeply rooted in the affection, and by length of time nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and grown to that ſtrength, that it is become like an old grown diſeaſe, too ſtrong for the Phyſick made uſe of; ſo that when any thing of reaſon is offered to the judgment tending to the health of the Soul in this Caſe, prejudice in the affection (like diſtempers in the Stomack) doth riſe up and forcibly reject it; this is too manifeſt in the ſecond ground, and is the cauſe of what's expreſſed in the third.</p>
                     <p>The remedies which by the bleſſing of God will be effectual to this good Woman, muſt be ſuitable to the advantages given to temptation, and ſuch as may take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.

If pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip be lawfully performed in that way, then it's a duty to joyn, and the heart muſt be kept with all diligence, that the way of Communion between God and our Souls be not ſtopt. 2. The cure of the old grown diſeaſe of Prejudice, will need the skill of the heavenly Phiſician; the cauſe of this Prejudice was the inward Corruption of the heart, which would not ſuffer to take gains in Gods way, but inclined to flightneſs and wearineſs; this corruption was much advantaged by the neglect of it at firſt, and want of clear Conviction in the point of ſet-forms, which was its ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, together with an opinion of ſerving God better. The means of cure muſt be gradual, to diſcern the Corruption of heart which lies at bottom, the neglect of it ſo long a time, the advantage given to it, to lay them to heart, humbly to confeſs them before the Lord, to crave pardon through the Blood of Chriſt, through purging of the heart, and ſetling of the judgment, which obtained prejudice will be prayed out, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62233:56"/>the heart and head return to ſoundneſs. Whileſt this cure by the bleſſing of God is in working, ſpecial care muſt be taken to prevent Relapſes, by acting with a doubting Conſcience.</p>

That when the heart hath been in the beſt frame, and moſt ſenſible, they have been worſt. 2. Find no trouble of Spirit upon forbearance; no wonder, whileſt the judgment is unreſolved, ſo great a prejudice remains, and an apprehenſion of ſin in joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 3. Find no inconvenience in ſtaying away, but ſending and waiting till that's done, and loſs of Scriptures, which we can read at home the ſame time. Is loſs of part of the publick Prayers of the Church, no loſs? and is private teaching to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with publick reading by an Officer of the Church, when they ſtand in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

His Anſwer by Letter, was in the Negative, ſaying, I bleſs God that ſuch temptations do drive you and your people to God the eſtabliſher of <hi>Zion.</hi>—It was an Expreſſion of Dr. <hi>Tuckneys</hi> to me, <hi>It is ill tranſplanting a Tree that thrives in the Soyl.</hi>—Think upon our Saviours Speech, <hi>When I ſent you without ſcrip or ſtaff, lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you my thing? and they ſaid nothing:</hi> Be not ſolicitous about your means, or the certainty of it; but ſet your Soul to the work, and Gods ſecret ſhall be upon your Tabernacle. — The Miniſter fixed his ſtaff where he was, according to Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers</hi> Example and Advice, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented it.</p>

               <p>Thus I have briefly given an account of Mr. <hi>Angiers</hi> ſolid and grave Anſwers to ſome Caſes of Conſcience, and but a ſmall taſt; for it were eaſie to fill a Volume with his various Letters upon like occaſions, to ſeveral Perſons.</p>

               <p>I Haſten to the part he acted upon the Stage of this World, in the laſt Scene of his Life, I mean in his Sickneſs, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious words that proceeded from him; for as he lived, ſo he died; his diſcourſes were Holy, Heavenly, Miniſtring Grace to the hearers. <hi>His mouth ſpake wiſdom, his tongue talked of judgment;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.30, 31.</note> for the law of his God was in his heart.</hi> The nearer approaches he made to Heaven, ſtill the more he breathed of Heaven; and tho many, yea, moſt of what he then ſpake, eſcapt the memory of Spectators or Byſtanders; yet ſome gleanings they committed to writing, which are as follow.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Thurſday, Auguſt,</hi> 16. 1677. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſhaking fit, he was more free in diſcourſe, than ordinarily he had been, and ſaid, I find my ſelf weak and feeble, and now think as much on my dear Wife, as at the very firſt; but God took courſe to wean me by her long Afflicton. To a Mother he ſaid, <hi>Be not ſharp or raſh with your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62233:57"/>leſt their affections be alienated;</hi> when they commit a fault, ſtay a while till your anger be over, and then counſel and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them, maintain love in them, as well as your authority over them.</p>
               <p>If it pleaſe God, I could be glad to live to ſee the good of the Church, and of my Children; if not, I ſhall dye in the faith of it, that God will remember them when I am gone, it may be then they will bethink themſelves, when they have not me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon. God can ſoon alter their temper if he pleaſe.</p>
               <p>To a young Woman that lived in his Family, he ſaid, As you have lived here many years, and by Gods help have been of ſome uſe, I am glad you are to be diſpoſed of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo good a Family that have been Children of the Covenant, <hi>for the mercy of the Lord is upon thouſands of them that fear him;</hi> and though you may meet with afflictions, yet I hope God will do you good, and help you to bear them; this was a true prediction; for God laid an heavy hand of affliction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her husband, and then pluckt him away by death, under ſome aſtoniſhing and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating circumſtances, known to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, yet God ſupported her very graciouſly.</p>
               <p>Concerning himſelf he ſaid, God hath made my condition comfortable in the World, I have lived comfortably, and have
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62233:58"/>kept that which my Father left me; he left me a good Portion, thinking (it may be) that I ſhould never be likely to get much in the world; and I have left it (or what is equivolent) to my Children, and if they make it away, the will of the Lord be done. This is my comfort, I have left no means unuſed, that I thought might be for their good; and it may be, God may bring them into ſtraits, when I am gone; and when he hath brought them into the wilderneſs, ſpeak to their hearts.</p>
               <p>My good child <hi>Betty!</hi> God took away poor <hi>Betty!</hi> but why ſhould I call her poor? She is rich, being with her beſt friend: I have had much grief for the loſs of my dear Wife, ſhe was dear to me, but her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs I could never yet envy.</p>
               <p>God hath in ſome meaſure given me an humble heart, and hath helped to carry humbly in my place, to Children and to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; let God have the Glory, in whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone I have comfort.</p>
               <p>One ſaid to him. Sir, what do you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend of your ſelf? he ſaid, I know not, but I have lived almoſt two Years above the age of a man; and if God have any further work for me to do, he will recover me; if not, why ſhould I deſire to live? I have taken great pains all my life, and never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to live an idle life, or a life of pleaſure, <hi>But for me to be with Chriſt is far better;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62233:58"/>henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous judg will give me.</hi>

               <p>His next fit was on Saturday, <hi>Aug.</hi> 25— Being very reſtleſs, one asked him where his pain lay? he ſaid, no great pain, but heat is pain enough; he asked what time a day it was? they ſaid ten a Clock; he ſaid, the day went ſlowly on, when one is ſick; but when well, we think time goes too faſt.</p>
               <p>At another time he ſaid, God hath ſet back the time, as in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> days; but ſaid he, if I could go to Chappel to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, I ſhould think all well; but I have no hope of that: <hi>But if God have a favour to me, he will bring me back, and ſhew me both it and his holy habitation; if not, let him do as ſeemeth him good:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Daughter coming into the Room, he ſaid, Oh that I could ſee my Children walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Gods ways and fear! if I could ſee my Son, his Wiſe and Children, minding the beſt things, and walking with God, I could dye with comfort. I could much deſire I could live to ſee it; I have Prayed and long waited for Gods Salvation: <hi>And thou Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, my ſon, know thou the God of thy fathers, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind, for the Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and underſtandeth all the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the thoughts; if thou ſeek him, he will

               <p>
                  <hi>Aug.</hi> 27.—Early in the morning, after a reſtleſs night, and many weary toſſings, being unable to lye ſtill, he ſaid, my ſtrength is ſpent; and added, I may ſay as <hi>Hezekiah, I am oppreſſed, Lord undertake for me:</hi> Iſa. 38.14.</p>
               <p>To his couſin he ſaid, We muſt not decline Gods ſervice for difficulty.</p>
               <p>Upon Tueſday, Mr. <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> (a worthy Miniſter) coming to viſit him, he deſired him to Pray with him; and being asked whether it was not fitter for him to pray for him in another room, becauſe the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians adviſed him to forbear company; he ſaid no, but let him pray with me; yet to prevent tediouſneſs, he told them this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Mr. <hi>Horrocks</hi> (which he had oft mentioned in his health) When Mr. <hi>Horrocks</hi> was ſick, Mr. <hi>Angier</hi> came to viſiſt him, juſt as Mr. <hi>Pike,</hi> (another honeſt Miniſter) was gone out from him; Mr. <hi>Horrocks</hi> ſaid, Mr. <hi>Angier,</hi> you muſt pray with me; but Mr. <hi>Pike</hi> hath kill'd me with a long prayer. When Mr. <hi>Conſtatine</hi> was gone, Mr. <hi>Angier</hi> ſaid, In ſickneſs we are wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ling to ſend for the Phyſitian of the Body, and ſhould we not ſend for the Phyſitian of the Soul? Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are the Souls Phyſitians; we need their help.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:62233:59"/>
               <p>That night he deſired that <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. to the end, might be read; and when it was read, he ſaid, Phyſitians of the body ſay, let not the Miniſter pray with the ſick; but the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>is any ſick among you? let him ſend for the elders of the church.</hi> When prayer was done, he ſaid, what a mercy is it! my underſtanding is as good as ever in all my life; one ſaid to him, Sir I think you underſtand every thing well, but your own weakneſs; he anſwered, I am ſenſible of weakneſs and wearineſs, and burnings: but what a mercy is it that tho <hi>my bones are vexed, my ſoul is not ſore vexe</hi> alſo, as <hi>Davids</hi> was! I bleſs God I am not afraid of death, yet what I may be I know not: Satan may tempt me when his chain is lengthened. One ſaid, No doubt, you will not want peace; he anſwered, I know not that; tho Satan could find no ſin in our Saviour, yet he may find matter enough in me; and added, that he had not in his health been altogether free from Satans Temptations, he had met with his Temptations both in a marryed and ſingle condition.</p>
               <p>The ſame night while one rubbed his feet, he ſaid, what a wonderful mercy is it, that the great God ſhould think upon, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his love upon ſuch a poor worm as I am. This he ſpake weeping; then ſaid he, I die, but God ſhall be with you, ſaying, I cannot leave you a greater comfort than the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence of the great God: he then
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62233:60"/>added. <hi>Bleſſed and holy is he that hath part in the firſt reſurrection, on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power:</hi> His feet being cold, and ſwearing, one rubbed them; he ſaid, my body is weak and feeble, an old tree will ſoon wither, but it muſt be cheriſhed, and be tenderly cared for, as well as the Soul; for it is <hi>the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and doth keep in it an immortal Soul, for a while.</p>
               <p>Altho the pangs of death were on him; yet he ſaid, Bleſſed be God, I feel no pain, but your cold hand; I would wait on God for a little ſleep. Lord I wait on thee, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy covenant, and thy word to thy Servant, which I have hoped for, and it hath been my ſupport and ſtrength in mine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; and through thy ſtrength I have been doing thy will, and endeavouring to keep thy commandments, altho in much weakneſs,; now Lord own thine own ſervant, do thine own work, make good thy own words; I believe in thee, I hope and wait for thee; hear the Prayers of thy ſervant, come Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Then ſaid he, I love Chriſt, and he loves me, and there's no love loſt betwixt us; I am his, and he is mine, and my deſire is towards him.</p>
               <p>One being preſent with him from <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> he asked of all his friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance there, and deſired to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62233:60"/>to them, charging them to live in love and peace; he ſaid, intreat them to pray to God for me, and that will do me more good than their preſents; and being told that many of the people of God were pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for him, he ſaid, Who am I a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that Gods people ſhould be ſo concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for me! I fear leſt they ſhould offend in being too earneſt with God for my life, for who knows but the Lord may hear prayers, and may bring me back from the greve, as he is wont to do?</p>
               <p>Afterwards he perceiving that others did ſuſpect his death, he deſired the 48th of <hi>Geneſis</hi> is to be read, where (ſaid he) old <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſed his Sons, and the 49. Where alter he had ſpoken to them by a Spirit of Prophecy, <hi>and commanded them,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. <hi>v.</hi> 33.</note> he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghoſt, and was gathered unto his people.</hi> And when they had done reading, he ſpake to them one by one, and prayed for a bleſſing for them; kiſſing the Children, he took leave of them, and deſired a Pſalm to be ſung, and he ſaid, ſing it chearfully (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.) It contains Chriſts love to the Church, and the Churches love to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Then he appointed his Grandſon to read a Chapter, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 23.) it concerns, ſaith he, ſlothful Shepherds, Gods Soul abhorred them, and he will curſe their labours, <hi>they ſhall not profit the people;</hi> they are fit for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62233:61"/>no uſe; adding, God will make a Beſome, and ſweep all ſuch out of his houſe; no man, ſaid he, will have a tenant that will not Till his land, but let houſe and ground go to ruin: God will take ſpecial care of his houſe.</p>
               <p>Then he ſaid, <hi>John,</hi> take counſel at your beſt friends, they will give you good Counſel, and ſet you good Example; meddle not with wicked, light, and vain perſons: remember the words of your dying Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father; then he deſired the 14th of <hi>John</hi> to be read, concerning Chriſts ſending the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Then he prayed earneſtly for the Church, that God would hear the Prayers of his people, and return to theſe nations, and ſet at liberty his Miniſters and People; Oh, ſaid he, that God would magnify the riches of his Grace, for his poor Church, for the ſake of Chriſt, for we are an unworthy people; but thy Son dyed to purchaſe the pardon of ſin, and reconciliation, and is ſet at thy right hand, pleading our cauſe; Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hear him, for us, and be at peace with us. Remember what hath been done and ſuffered for reformation, and the precious Blood of thy Saints, which hath been ſhed, this is the ſeed of thy Church; remember the prayers of ſuch as are now with thee, and of ſuch as are yet alive, in the behalf of their ſeed, and the ſeed of thy Church, and

               <p n="1">1. An eminent Divine took notice, that Mr. <hi>Angier</hi> ſaid, he would not be rich, or that he wiſhed not to be rich, or have his Relations rich; nay, that he was really a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of it; probably reſpecting it not, mentioning that of the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10. or that <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8, 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, he uſed to obſerve, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was moſt in the Country, rather than Towns and Cities: or that ordinarily the power of Godlineſs, ſimplicity, ſincerity, are found among Husbandmen rather than tradeſmen.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in Cities, Towns, and among the trading part, there was much exceſs in

               <p n="4">4. That he did not judg it fit to call any Gentlewoman, Madam, except ſhe was a Lady indeed; adding, that men never called women, Madams, but ſince they loved other women better than their wives.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, he uſed to ſay, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherein Godly perſons are more apt to miſs it, than in the buſineſs of Marriage, both upon their own account, and their Children.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Again, he uſed to ſay, it's an hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſee another bleſſed with ſucceſs in his Miniſtry, and our own labours blaſted, and not to grudge or be diſcontented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Again, if God will help me to take care of my duty, I will leave him to take care both of my maintainance, and of the fruit of my labours.</p>
               <p n="8">8. He ſaid, when perſons have laid their dead relations, or friends, in the grave, they ſay, they have been performing the laſt office for them; but they are miſtaken, for they have yet ſomething to do for their names or poſterity.</p>
