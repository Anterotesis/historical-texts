            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Lady <hi>Frances Howard,</hi> before the Kings Delegates, <hi>Geor. Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Iohn London, Lanc<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ely, Rich. Leichfield</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> Doctor <hi>Caesar, Thomas Parry, Daniel Dunne, Iohn Bennet, Franc. Iames,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Edwards,</hi> authorised under the Kings Broad Seale, Plaintiffs, in <hi>Ian.</hi> 1616.</p>
            <p>That she and <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> were married by publique Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, in <hi>Ian.</hi> 1603.</p>
            <p>That she at the same time was fully thirteen years old, and is at this time twenty two, or twenty three.</p>
            <p>That the foresaid <hi>Robert</hi> at the time of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Marriage was about fourteen, and is about two and twenty, or three and twenty at this time; and ever since, and at this present is a man (as far forth as a man may judge) and hath been in good health and perfect estate of body, not any way hindred by any ague or sicknesse, but that he might have carnall copulation with a woman.</p>
            <p>That since the pretended Marriage at least by the space of a whole year, and continued three years after the said <hi>Robert</hi> had fully attained the age of eighteen
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52051:3"/>
yeares (as time and place did serve) after the fashion of other marryed Folks, the said <hi>Frances Howard</hi> in hope of lawfull Issue and desirous to be made a Mother, lived together with the said <hi>Robert</hi> at bed and board, and lay both naked, and alone in the same bed (as married Folks use) and desirous to be made a Mother from time to time, again, and again yeelded herselfe to his power, and as much as lay in her offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her self and her body to be known, and earnestly desired conjunction and copulation: And also the said Earle in the same time, very often, again and again, did try to have copulation as with his lawful wife, which she refused not, but used the best means she could. Notwithstanding all this, the said Earle could never carnally know her, nor have that copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any sort which the Married-bed alloweth; yet before the said pretended Marriage and since, the said Earle hath had, and hath power and ability of body to deal with other women, and to know them car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and sometimes hath felt the motions and pricks of the flesh carnally and tending to carnal copulation as he saith, and believeth: but by perpetual and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral impediment hath been hindered all the former time, and is at this present, that he can have no copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with the said Lady <hi>Frances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, the said Lady <hi>Frances</hi> hath been, and is a woman fit and able to have copulation with a man and such an one as may be carnally known, neither hath in this regard any impediment.</p>
            <p>Moreover the said Lady <hi>Frances</hi> remaineth, and is at this present a Virgin.</p>
            <p>Also at the time of the pretended marriage, the said Lady <hi>Frances</hi> was unacquainted with the said Earles want of ability and impediment formerly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>And furthermore, the said Earle long before this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52051:3"/>
Suit commenced, hath very often, and at sundry times confessed in good earnest, before witnesses of good credite, and his friends and kinsfolks, that although he did his best endeavour, yet he never could not, nor at this time can have Copulation with the said Lady <hi>Frances,</hi> no not once.</p>
            <p>And also in regard of womanish modesty, the said Lady <hi>Frances</hi> hath concealed the former matter, and had a purpose ever to conceale it, if she had not been forced through false rumours of disobedience to the said Earle to reveale them.</p>
            <p>She requireth, since this pretended Matrimony is but a fact, and not in right; It may be Pronounced, Adjudged, and Declared, as none of none effect, and she may be quit and freed from all Knot and Bond of the same, by your Sentence and Authority.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>The Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> replyeth, <hi>5. Jun. 1614.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>TO the first and second, he answereth affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively.</p>
               <p>To the third, he thinketh that at the time of his Marriage he was full fourteen years, and is now twenty two and upwards; neither since hath had, or hath any sicknesse or impediments to hinder him, but that he might have had Copulation of a woman, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the time of his sicknesse of the Smal-Pox, two or three years after the said Marriage, which continued for a moneth or six weeks, and at another time, when he had few fits of an Ague.</p>
               <p>To the fourth he affirmeth, that for one year he diverse times attempted: that the two other years he did lye in bed most commonly with her, but felt no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or provocation; and therefore attempted the first year: when he was willing, she shewed her self some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52051:4"/>
willing, but other times refused.</p>
               <p>To the fifth, he answereth, that he never knew her carnally, but found not any defect in himself; yet was not able to penetrate into the wombe, nor enjoy her.</p>
               <p>To the sixth, he believeth, that before and after the marriage, he hath found an ability of body to know any other woman, and hath oftentimes felt motions and provocations of the Flesh, rending to carnal copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; but for perpetuall and natural impediments he knoweth not what the words meaneth, but that he hath layen by the Lady <hi>Frances</hi> two or three years, and hath no motion to know her, and believeth he never shall.</p>
               <p>To the seventh, he believeth not that the said Lady <hi>Frances</hi> is a woman apt and fit for carnal copulation, because he hath not found it.</p>
               <p>To the eighth and nineth, he believeth them both to be true, and thin' eth that once before some wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of credit, he did speak to this purpose, that he had oftentimes endeavoured carnally to know her, but that he did not nor could.</p>

               <head>The Lord Arch-bishop his Speech to his Majesty.</head>
               <p>IN as much as we firmly believe that the Scripture directly or by consequence doth contain in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient matter to decide all controversies, especially in things appertaining to the Church, and that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage amongst Christians can be no lesse accompted then a sacred thing, as being instituted by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in Paradice, honoured by the presence of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himself, declared by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be a signe of the spiritual conjunction between Christ and his Church.</p>
               <p>I would be glad to know by what Text of Scripture
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52051:4"/>
either by the Old or New Testament, a man may have a warrant to make a Nullity of a Marriage so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly celebrated <hi>propter maleficium versus hanc</hi>: which I doe the rather ask, because I finde warrants expressely (in the Scriptures) to make a Nullity of marriage, <hi>propter frigiditatem,</hi> by the words of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.12. For there be some which are Chaste or Eunuches, which are so born of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers belly, and there be some which are made chaste of men, and there be some which have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves chaste for the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
               <p>I would also know gladly, what ancient Father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Greeks or Latines, by occasion of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture, or any disputation hath menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>maleficium versus hanc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like I demand touching ancient Councels, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther General or Provincial, and concerning Stories Ecclesiastical, whether any such matter be to be found in them. If (for ought that appeareth) never mention was made of this untill <hi>Hercanus Rhemesis Episcopus,</hi> who lived 400. years after Christ, it may well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that this was a concomitant of darknesse and Popish superstition, which about that time grew to so great an height (God permitting them) that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might fall upon the Children of Unbelief.</p>
               <p>But since the light of the Gospel is now in so great a measure broken forth again, why should not I hope that those who have imbraced the Gospel should be free from this <hi>maleficium,</hi> especially, since amongst a million of men in our age, there is not one found in all our Country, who is clearly, and evidently known to be troubled with the same, and if there should be any, which should seem to be molested, we are taught to use two remedies, the one spiritual physick, the other external.</p>
               <p>For the first, our Saviour said, <hi>hoc genus demoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52051:5"/>
non ejicitur nisi per orationem &amp; Iejunium.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaking of the Devil, <hi>cui resistite firmi in side</hi>: and the <hi>Canonists</hi> themselves prescribe Alms, Fasting and Prayer, to be used in that case; but that they joyn Supplication and their exorcismes thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: And for corporal medicine to be applyed there with, as against a disease. So is the Judgement of our late Divines, whether they speak of <hi>Maleficium</hi> or not.</p>
               <p>Now admit the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> might be imagined to be troubled with <hi>maleficium versus hanc,</hi> I demand what Alms hath been given, what Fasting hath been used, and what Prayers have been poured forth to appease the wrath of God towards him or his wife; or what Physick hath been taken or medicine applyed for three years together: Not one of those things, but the first hearing must be to pronounce a Nullity in the Marriage; of which Declaration, we know the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but no mortal mans wit can foresee the end, either in his person, or in the example.</p>
               <p>The Arch-bishop for Confirmation of this opinion shewed the testimony of <hi>Beza, Melancthon, Perillus, Hemingus, Pollanus, Feriterius,</hi> and <hi>Gautius.</hi>

               <p>TO the first Article, That the Scripture doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or by consequence contain sufficient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to decide all controversies, especially in things appertaining to the Church, this is in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>proposites,</hi> and one of the Puritans arguments, without a better distinction or explanation.</p>
               <p>For the Orthodox proposition is, that the Scripture doth directly or by consequence contain in it sufficient matter to decide all Controversies in points of Faith
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52051:5"/>
and Salvation; of which sort a nullity of marriage can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accompted, and therefore your consequence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Proposition must faile. For satisfaction of your following Question, I say, your second question doth answer it: if there be warrant in Scripture for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing a Nullity <hi>propter frigiditatem,</hi> then all the means which make him <hi>frigidus versus hanc,</hi> must be comprehended therein: for, why doth our Church justly condemn the Marriage of a man with his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Daughter, or the marriage of two Sisters, but a <hi>paritate rationis,</hi> for none of them is in <hi>terminis</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by Scriptures, onely the construction is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a <hi>paritate rationis</hi>: for if it be not lawfull to marry your Fathers Wife, because thereby you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover your Fathers shame; nor his Sister, because she is his Kinswoman; nor your own Sister, because there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you discover your Father and Mothers shame; it can no more be lawfull to marry your Sisters Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for thereby you discover also your own shame, as also the same reason serves for ascending or descending in points of Consanguinity, <hi>Quia par est ratio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like is in this case: for although Christ spake onely of three sorts of Eunuches, yet <hi>ratio est quia non potest esse copulatio inter Eunuchum &amp; muli<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rum</hi>; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1. of <hi>Cor. v.</hi> 7. telleth us clearly, that it is not <hi>conjugium sine copulatione</hi>: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, <hi>à paritate rationis,</hi> that Christ did comprehend under these three sorts all inability, which doth perpetually hinder <hi>copulationem versus hanc</hi>: whether it be naturall or accidentall, for what difference is there between cutting off the hand, and being made impotent thereof? <hi>Amputatio &amp; mutila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio membri,</hi> is all one in the Civil law; and it is a little defrauding of the woman, when either he who is to be her Husband is Gelded, or when the use of that mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber towards her is by any unlawfull means taken from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52051:6"/>
him: neither is it any way needfull to crave the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular warrant of the Scripture for a Nullity, no more then of warrantie in that place for any Nullity at all: For Christ doth not directly say, that a marriage so married shall be Nullified, neither doth he teach us what form of Process shall be used, in that neither makes he mention of the triennial probation, no more then he forbiddeth marrying within the fourth degree without leave obtained of the Bishop of the Diocesse: It is then sufficient for all moderate examinants to be taught out of the Word of God, that marriage is <hi>nulla sine copula</hi>; and that word, <hi>quos Deus conjunxit,</hi> is never found in Scripture where <hi>durant ius</hi> doth not proceed (<hi>viz.</hi>) they two shall be one flesh.</p>
               <p>But whether the impediments be universall, or <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus hanc</hi> only, or whether the fault thereof hath been born with him, or done to him by violence, or fallen to him by disease, or disproportion or inaptitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the persons, or unnaturall practices, that is ever <hi>par ratio,</hi> he is <hi>Eunuchus versus hanc, &amp; omnes alias,</hi> seeing to her onely was he married.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>paritate rationis,</hi> such nullities are grounded upon the foresaid warrantie of Scripture; neither hath Christ any occasion to speak of Jews marrying, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>maleficium versus hanc</hi>; for although it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that God made King <hi>Abimelech</hi> and his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants unable to abuse <hi>Sara Abrahams</hi> wife, and so was made by God himself <hi>Eunuchus versus hanc,</hi> and that be not improbable, that the Devil being Gods Ape, should imitate Gods works by his filthy Witch-craft by making such as God will permit unable <hi>versus hanc</hi>; howbeit, it be very probable that it was long after that the Devil put that trick upon the earth.</p>
               <p>As for the third and fourth questions, what menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fathers and Councils doe make of <hi>maleficium versus hanc.</hi> I answer, that it may be (if they were
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52051:6"/>
searched) that either something to this purpose in them, or at least <hi>aliquid analogum,</hi> with <hi>à paritate rationis,</hi> or by consequence, may serve to decide the question.</p>
               <p>But leaving this to search, my main answer, is, that we must distinguish of times: for in all the first ages as long as persecution lay heavy upon the Church, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Empire Christian, the Church did not meddle with any thing which drew a consequence after it of possession or inheritance, as marriage doth. Nay, even divers hundred years after the Conversion of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, the judgement and disposition of all such questions did still remain <hi>in foro civili,</hi> untill the Popedome began to wax great, and to assume, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to usurpe to her self a supream and independant Judicature in all Ecclesiastical Causes; and therefore the Fathers and the Councils had no occasion to make mention of that which was not <hi>prefori</hi> at that time.</p>
               <p>And besides, that is an evill argument to say such a thing is unlawfull, because the the Fathers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils make no mention of it: for you know much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then I, divers and many Points betwixt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and us are never mentioned by the Fathers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that they could never have dreamed that such questions would arise, and therefore are the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers exact onely in such questions, as were agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the stage in their time, as <hi>de Trinitate, de Duabus in Christo naturis,</hi> and such like; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sufficient, that there can be nothing found which may justly be understood to contradict this opinion: and it is very probable (J say) before that, this trick of <hi>maleficium</hi> had not been put in practise in the world; and therefore not known or mentioned by them. For why may not the Devil as well finde out new tricks of Witch-craft (when God will permit him) as he doth daily new Sects and Heresies? for his malice can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver end untill the end of times.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52051:7"/>To the fifth Argument my former question doth also serve, for till the four hundred year after God (it may be) that divellish trick came never to be discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; you know the old Proverb, <hi>Ex malis moribus bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae leges</hi>; and it is not unlikely, that that time of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse gave the devil occasion to devise such new tricks, (look my <hi>Demonologie</hi>) and yet was that law for which you cite <hi>Ibircanus</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, who in many great points (as you know) had so great light as I doe scarce tearm this time a time of blindnesse; but how great soever that darknesse was in point of Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will still maintain as I have ever done, that for matter of order and policie, all the world shall never be able to finde out any so good, and so old an order of Government to be put in the place of that; in signe whereof there is no well governed Common-wealth in the Christian world wherein the Common-law is not received to judge in questions of that nature. And it is certain that this question now in hand is onely a question of order and policie, for the ground of this question, that the essential point of Matrimony cannot be accomplished <hi>sine copula,</hi> is warranted by Scripture, and warranted by your self.</p>
               <p>To your sixth Argument, or rather hope, I fear that hope shal prove contrary to faith; for as sure as God is, there be devils, and some devils must have some power, and their power is in this world, neither are the elect exempted from this power: <hi>Iob</hi> was not, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> was not; Christ said to all his Disciples, <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buerit vos Sathanas</hi>: and if the Devil hath any power, it is over their flesh; and if over their flesh, rather over the filthiest and most sinful part thereof, whereunto Original sin is soldered. As God before, and under the Law, to shew <hi>officii altum</hi> of purging mans original sin, the <hi>praeputium</hi> of the foreskin. And to exempt these of our Profession from the power of Witchraft, is a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52051:7"/>
never yet maintained by any learned or wise men.</p>
               <p>That the Devils power is not so universal against us, I freely confesse, but that it is utterly restrained, <hi>quoad nos,</hi> how was then a Minister of <hi>Geneva</hi> bewitched to death? and were the Witches daily puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by our Law, if they can harm none but the Papists, we are too charitable for avenging them only.</p>
               <p>Sathan is permitted to punish man as well for the breach of the second, as of the first Table, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are we no lesse guilty then the Papists are; and if the power of Witchraft reach to our life, much more to a member not so governed by the fancy wherein the Devil hath his principal operation; and he may so enstrange the Husbands affections towards the Wife, as he cannot be able to performe that duty unto her; for that is a common thing in many mens natures, that they cannot doe that thing but where they love, nor fight but where they are angry: God keep us therefore from putting the trial of our Profession upon Miracles; let the Miracle-mongers live by their owne Trade.</p>
               <p>To the seventh Argument touching Remedies, what doe you know whether both parties, or either of them, have used their meanes of remedy or not? and that special remedy should be used publikly? for then I can see no necessity, for <hi>non interest reipub. nec ecclesiae,</hi> and private persons are commanded to their fastings, and their Almes secretly and in private; no such cure also is likely to succeed well, except the parties own hearts and desires be set thereupon.</p>
               <p>And as for your conclusion upon the <hi>incommoda,</hi> whether upon his person or the example, I can see none in either, so as to the couple between the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was never accomplished; truly they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure both of them by the Declaration of the Nullity be made capable to accompish Marriage with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52051:8"/>
others, which they could never doe between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, wherein they may have the satisfaction of their hearts, and enjoy the blessing of Procreation of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And as for the Example, the Law should be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, with due administration of Justice, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not serve for an example or president of a counterfeit Nullity hereafter: <hi>authoritas facti,</hi> or rather <hi>non facti sed luce clarior</hi> in this case; besides the many proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and confessions of the parties which have been taken in this processe: whereas by the contrary if they shall be forcibly kept together, their names and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows may be kept together, but never their persons or affections, and they still be forced to lie in perpetual scandal and misery, or both; and what such a kinde of forced continencie may availe, the Monks continencie may teach us. And for a president in time to come, that reacheth no further then to open a way of lawful relief to any persons who shall chance to be distressed in that sort.</p>
               <p>And for the Legal Doubts, they concerne none of your calling; for if your conscience be resolved in point of Divinity, that is your part to give your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to Nullity, and let the Lawyers take the burden of making it so formal.</p>
               <p>And as for the Trienial probation, I hope no man can be so blinde as to make a doubt whether it be taken before or after the suit began.</p>
               <p>And in conclusion of divine solution of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, proved clearly, that this resolution of this doubt, howsoever it was in blindnesse, as you think, that is now proved in the greatest time of light and purity of the profession of the Gospel: And for your extract upon the late Divines opinions upon this question, I cannot guesse what your intent was in sending them to me, for they all agree in tearms of my opinion; but there is such a thing as <hi>Maleficium &amp; maleficiale versus
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52051:8"/>
hanc</hi>: And your very enterlude passage proves the clearest; and for that advice concerning the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that is <hi>consilium non decretum,</hi> not imposing a necessity, but is to be used by discretion, as occasion shall serve or require it.</p>
               <p>To conclude then, if this may satisfie your doubts, I will end with our Saviours words to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter, Cum conversus fueris confirma sratres tuos</hi>; for on my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, all the doubts that I have seen, are nothing but <hi>Nodos in scirpo quaerere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Midwives appointed to make inspection upon the Ladies body, gave in, that the Lady of <hi>Essex</hi> is a woman apt to have copulation, to bring forth children, and that the said Lady is a Virgin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted. Three Ladies affirme that they believe the same, for that they were present when the Midwives made their inspection, and did see them give good reasons for it.</p>
               <p>There is a sentence of Divorce given for the Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Marriage, and both parties married againe.</p>

            <head>The proceedings against <hi>Richard Weston,</hi> at his Arraingment at <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> Novem. <hi>19. 1615.</hi> before the Lord <hi>Maior,</hi> the Lord Chief Iustice of <hi>England,</hi> and three other Iustices of the Kings Bench, <hi>Crook, Dodrige,</hi> and <hi>Hanton,</hi> and Serjeant <hi>Crew</hi> another of the Commissioners.</head>
            <p>THE Court being set, the Kings special Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission being read, the Lord Chiefe Justice gave the Charge; the effect whereof was, First, to expresse the Kings pious inclination and command unto just proceedings against all such as should be any way proved to be guilty of the murthering and poysoning of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Tho. Overbury,</hi> his Majesties prisoner in the Tower.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to aggravate the manner, and quality of the murther, in shewing the basenesse of poysoning above all other kinds of murther; declaring the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God, and his justice in punishing the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; he alleadged Gen. 9.6. <hi>Quicunque effunderit humanum sanguinem effundetur sanguis illius, ad Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem quippe factus esthomo</hi>: He also took the example of <hi>Vrias</hi> by <hi>David</hi>; he therein observed how adultery is most often the begetter of that sin.</p>
            <p>Then he declared that of all Felonies, murther is the most horrible; of all murthers, poysoning the most detestable; and of all poysoning, the lingering poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning.</p>
            <p>He shewed how by an Act of Parliament, 22. <hi>H.</hi> 8, 9.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52051:10"/>
it was made Treason, and that wilful poysoners should be boyled to death, rehearsing the example of one <hi>Richard Rouse</hi> that had poysoned a man and woman, and was therefore scalded to death.</p>
            <p>Then he laid open to the Jury the basenesse and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardliness of poysoners, who attempt it secretly, against which there is no means of preservation or defence for a mans life; and how rare it was to heare of poysoning in <hi>England,</hi> so detestable to our Nation, but that since the Devil hath taught divers to be so cunning in it, so that they can poyson in what distance of place they please by consuming the <hi>Nativum calidum,</hi> or <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum radicale,</hi> in one month, two or three, or more as they list, which they foure manner of wayes do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute, 1 <hi>Gustu.</hi> 2 <hi>Haustu.</hi> 3 <hi>Odore.</hi> 4 <hi>Contactu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He finisheth his charge with serious exhortations to the Jury to do justice in presenting the truth, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the greatnesse of any that upon their evidence should appeare to be guilty of the same of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, comforting both Judge and Jury with the Scripture, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.8. <hi>fin. For thou Lord wilt blesse the righteous, with favour wilt thou comfort them as with a shield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The charge being ended, the Jury consisting of fourteen persons, did for the space of an houre depart from the Court into a private room, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their evidence from Mr. <hi>Fanshaw</hi> his Majesties Coroner, and his Highnesse Councel prepared and instructed for that purpose, with the examinations and confessions as well of the Prisoner himselfe, as of divers witnesses before that time taken by the Lord Chiefe Justice of <hi>England,</hi> and others of the Lords of his Majesties Councel.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Mr. <hi>William Goare</hi> Sheriffe of <hi>London,</hi> was commanded to fetch his Prisoner remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his house, to be ready in Court for his Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52051:10"/>
So a certaine space after, the Grand Jury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Bar, and delivered in their Bill of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, signed <hi>Billa vera</hi>; whereupon the Prisoner was set up to the Bar, and the Indictment read by Mr. <hi>Fanshaw,</hi> which contained in effect:</p>
            <p>That <hi>Richard Weston</hi> being about the age of sixty yeares, not having the feare of God before his eyes, but instigated by the Devil, devised and contrived not only to bring upon the body of Sir <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> great sicknesse and diseases, but also deprive him of his life: and to bring the same to passe, the ninth of <hi>May</hi> 1613. and in the eleventh yeare of his Majesties Reigne, at the Tower of <hi>London</hi> in the Parish of <hi>Alhallows Barking,</hi> did obtaine and get into his hands certaine poyson of green and yellow colour, called <hi>Rosacar</hi> (knowing the same to be deadly poyson) and the same did maliciously and feloniously compound and mingle with a kinde of Broth powred into a certaine dish, and the same Broth so infected, did give and deliver to the said S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Th. Overb.</hi> as good and wholsome Broth, to the intent to kill and poyson the said S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> which Broath he took and did eat.</p>
            <p>Also the said <hi>Weston</hi> upon the first of <hi>Iuly, an.</hi> 11 Reigne aforesaid, did in like manner get another poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or poysonous powder, called <hi>White-arsnick,</hi> and knowing the same to be deadly poyson, did give unto the said S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> as good and wholesome to eat, who in like manner took and eat the same.</p>
            <p>Also that <hi>Weston</hi> upon the said nineteenth of <hi>Iuly</hi> following, did get another poyson called <hi>Mercury sublimate,</hi> knowing the same to be mortal poyson, and put and mingled the same in Tarts and Jellies, and gave the same to the said S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> as good and wholesome to eat, which he in like manner took, and did eat.</p>
            <p>Also the said <hi>Weston,</hi> and another man unknown
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52051:11"/>
(being an Apothecary) afterwards upon the fourteenth of <hi>Decem.</hi> felloniously did get a poyson called <hi>Mercury sublimate,</hi> knowing the same to be deadly poyson, and <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut the same into a Glister; and the said Glister, the said Apothecary for the reward of 20 <hi>li.</hi> promised unto him, did put and administer as good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some into the guts of the said S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas</hi>; &amp; that <hi>Weston</hi> was present and aiding to the said Apothecary in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string &amp; infusing the said Glister; and immediately after S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Th.</hi> did languish, and fell into diseases &amp; distempers, and from the aforesaid times of taking and eating the said poysoned meats, and ministring the said Glister, he dyed. And so the Jury gave their verdict that <hi>Weston</hi> in this manner had killed, poysoned, and murthered the said S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Tho. Overbury,</hi> against the Kings peace and dignity.</p>
            <p>Which Indictment being read, he was demanded if he were guilty of the Fellony, murthering and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning as aforesaid, yea, or no? To which he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, doubling his speech, <hi>Lord have mercy upon me; Lord have mercy upon me.</hi> But being again deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he answered, Not guilty; and being then deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded how he would be tryed, he answered. He referred himself to God, and would be tryed by God, refusing to put himselfe and his cause on the Jury or Country according to the Law and Custome.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Lord Chiefe Justice, and all other in their order, spent the space of an houre in perswading him to put himselfe upon the trial of the Law, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring unto him the danger and mischiefe he runnes into by resisting his ordinary course of triall, being the means ordained by God for his deliverance if he were innocent; and how by this means he should make himselfe the authour of his owne death, even as if he should with a knife or dagger kill or stab himselfe; exhorting him very earnestly either with repentance
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52051:11"/>
to confesse his fault, or else with humility and duty to submit himselfe to his ordinary trial; whereupon he stubbornly answered, Welcome by the grace of God; and he referred himself to God, and so no perswasions would prevail: The Lord Chiefe Justice plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his opinion, that he was perswaded that <hi>Weston</hi> had been dealt withall by some great ones (guilty of the same fact) as accessary, to stand mute, whereby they might escape their punishment; and therefore he commanded (for satisfaction of the world) that the Queens Attorney there present should declare and set forth the whole evidence without any fear or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality; and yet notwithstanding, he once more used much perswasion to the Prisoner to consider what destruction he had brought upon himself by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and declared unto him his offence of contempt was in refusing his triall, and how the Laws of the Land had provided a sharp and more severe punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to such offenders, then unto those that were guilty of high Treason, and so repeated the form of the Judgement given against such, the extremity and rigor whereof was expressed in these words; <hi>Onore, frigore, &amp; fame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first, that he was to receive his punishment by the Law, to be extended, and then to have weights laid upon him, no more then he was able to bear, which were by little and little to be increased.</p>
            <p>For the second, that he was to be exposed in an open place near to the prison in the open aire being naked.</p>
            <p>And lastly, that he was to be served with the coursest bread to be gotten, and water out of the next sink or puddle to the place of Execution; and that day he had water, he should have no bread; and that day he had bread, he should have no water: and in this torment he was to linger as long as nature could
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52051:12"/>
linger out; so that oftentimes they lived in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity eight or nine dayes: adding further, that as life left him, so judgement should finde him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he required him upon considerations of these reasons, to advise himself to plead to the Country, who notwithstanding absolutely refused.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Lord Chiefe Justice willed S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Hide</hi> the Queens Attorney, and there of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel for the King, to manifest unto the audience the guiltinesse of the said <hi>Weston</hi> by his owne confession, signed with his owne hand; and if in the declaration thereof they met with any great persons whatsoever (as certainly there was great ones confederates in that fact) he should boldly and faithfully open whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was necessary, and he could prove against them; whereupon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Attorney began his accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>First, he charged the Countesse of <hi>Somerset</hi> and and the Earle to be principal movers of this unhappy conclusion, Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> to be of the confederacie, and the pay-mistresse of the Poysoners rewards; in which I could not but observe the Attornies boldnesse in tearming the Countesse a dead and rottten branch, which being lopt off, the whole Tree (meaning that noble Family) would prosper the better.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he proceeded to the cause, which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be the malice of the Countesse, and the ground of this malice he alleadged, and by many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements he evidently affirmed that S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Tho. Over.</hi> had perswaded him from that adulterate marriage of the Countesse of <hi>Somerset</hi> then Countesse of <hi>Essex,</hi> and for this he alleadged as followeth.</p>
            <p>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Tho. Over.</hi> having divers times disswaded the Earle, then Viscount <hi>Rochester,</hi> from seeking by any means to procure marrying with the Countesse of <hi>Essex</hi> (to which he saw the Earle too much inclined)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52051:12"/>
having very earnest conference with the Earle one night in private in the Gallery at <hi>White-hall</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his intendments, perceiving the Earle that time too much to desire that unlawful conjunction; in the ardency of his fervent affection unto the Earle, and great prescience of future misery it would inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably bring unto him (his wel-beloved Lord, and friend) used speeches to this effect: Well my Lord, if you do marry that filthy base woman, you will ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ruine your honour, and your selfe; you shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do it by mine advice or consent: and if you do, you had best look to stand fast.</p>
            <p>My Lord replyed (bewitched with the love of the Countesse, and moved with the words of Sir <hi>Tho. Over.</hi> for sleighting her) My owne legs are streight, and strong enough to bear me up; but in faith, I will be even with you for this: and so parted from him in a great rage.</p>
            <p>This conference was over-heard by some in an adjoyning room, and their depositions for the truth thereof were read in Court.</p>
            <p>Although this conference moved the Earle to such a suddain choler, yet it seemed Sir <hi>Tho. Over.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited it not to be otherwise then a suddain extream distemperature, or passion, and not a final conclusion of their bosome friendship; in which the Earle seemed as reciprocal as before, howsoever in his double dealing it seemed to be clearly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>For upon this the Earle moved the King to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Sir <hi>Tho. Over.</hi> to be Ambassadour for <hi>Russia</hi>: the King willing to prefer Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> as one whose worth and valour was yet unknowne to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, accordingly injoyned him that service; the which Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was most willing to accept of as a gracious aspect of the King towards him: which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52051:13"/>
of his was proved by the depositions of two or three witnesses read in Court, and by the oath of Sir <hi>Dudly Diggs,</hi> who voluntarily at the arraignment, in open Court upon his oath witnessed how Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> had imparted to him his readinesse to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in an Ambassage.</p>
            <p>The Earle as well abusing the Kings favours in moving to shew favour, wherein he meant the party should take no benefit, as bearing unhonest friendship in conference with Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> concerning that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, perswaded him to refuse to serve Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, whereby (quoth he) I shall not be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme such kindnesse to your advantage, as having you with me; and (quoth he) if you be blamed or committed for it, care not, I will quickly free you from all harme: Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> thus betrayed by a friend, refused to serve in that nature, whereupon by just e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity he was committed to the Tower.</p>
            <p>Being thus committed, he was presently commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted close prisoner, and a Keeper he must have, and who must that be but this <hi>Weston,</hi> who was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Countesse of <hi>Essex</hi> to Sir <hi>Thomas Monson</hi> to be by him commended over unto the Lieutenant of the Tower to be Keeper to Sir <hi>Tho. Over.</hi> Sir <hi>Tho. Monson</hi> according to the Countesses request, commended the said <hi>Weston</hi> to Sir <hi>Iervas Elvis</hi>: whereupon the Lieutenant entertained the said <hi>Weston,</hi> and appointed him to be Keeper to Sir <hi>Th. Overb.</hi> The said <hi>Weston</hi> upon his own confession read in Court, signed with his mark, had during the time that she was Countesse of <hi>Essex,</hi> been a procurer and a Pander to the said Earle Viscount <hi>Rochester,</hi> and the said Countesse of <hi>Essex,</hi> for the convening and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of their adulterate desires, which they did divers times consummate, meeting in Mrs. <hi>Turners</hi> house once between the houres of eleven and twelve
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52051:13"/>
at <hi>Hamersmith,</hi> and divers times elsewhere for that purpose: so that now by the procurement of the said Countess (who hated Sir <hi>T. Overb.</hi> for being a means to keep them from contaminating themselves with such lustful imbracements, and from the proposed Marriage they mutually laboured to compass) Her Pander was become his Keeper, a fit Agent for Lust and Murther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Weston</hi> now being become Sir <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> Keeper, kept him so close, that he could scarce have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the dayes brightness, neither suffered he any one to visit him, father, brother, his best friends, his neerest kindred were strangers to him from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the imprisonment unto the end.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Turner,</hi> upon the first dayes keeping, promised him a contented reward if he would administer such things to Sir <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> as should be sent unto him, thinking him a fit instrument to compass black mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that was so well acquainted with foul lust (and so indeed they found him,) for he agreed, and did promise to administer whatsoever she would send him. Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> upon this murtherous promise, the very same day <hi>Weston</hi> became Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> Keeper, being 6. <hi>May,</hi> 1613. sent unto him the said <hi>Weston</hi> certain yellow poyson called <hi>Rosacar,</hi> in a viall; <hi>Weston</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that poyson the foresaid 6. <hi>May,</hi> at night bringing Sir <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> supper in one hand, and the vial in the other, meets with the Lieutenant, and asks him in these terms, <hi>Sir, shall I give it him now</hi>; upon this word <hi>now</hi> my Lord Chief Justice demurs to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate the maliciousness, affirming that this particle <hi>now</hi> shewed a resolution to poyson him, onely fit time and circumstances were to be respected by him. What shall you give him? replyes the Lieutenant. <hi>VVeston</hi> replyes, As if you do not know Sir. The Lieutenant blaming him, he carries the poyson into an inner
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52051:14"/>
room, which <hi>Weston</hi> did administer to Sir <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> the 9. <hi>May</hi> in broth: this was proved both by <hi>Weston</hi> and the Lieutenants Confession.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Weston</hi> having given this poyson, which wrought very vehemently with him by vomits, and extream purging, he presently demands his reward of Mrs. <hi>Turner,</hi> who replies, The man is not yet dead, perfect your work, and you shall have your hire. This was confessed by <hi>Weston</hi> under his mark.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> by his close imprisonment and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, growing sick, and daily languishing, after three or four weeks space considering he had not obtained his freedome and release, having no friends suffered to come unto him, but onely such as the Earl sent to comfort him (of his own followers) wrote to the Earl to remember his imprisonment, who returned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, The time would not suffer, but assoon as possible it might be he would hasten his delivery (so indeed it seems he intended to do) but not so as Sir <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> conceived, whose true affection would not admit his judgement to debate the strangeness of his imprisonment, which he might well think then the Earl might easily have relieved.</p>
            <p>On the 5. of <hi>Iune</hi> Viscount <hi>Rochester</hi> sent a Letter to Sir <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> in the Letter he sent him a white powder, willing Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> to take it, It will (quoth he) make you more sick, but fear not, I will make this a means for your delivery, and for the recovery of your health: Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> never dreaming of base treachery, but conceiving of it as friendly policy, received the said powder, which wrought upon him most vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, whereupon his sickness grew more violent, and his languishment encreased: which white powder upon <hi>Westons</hi> confession was poyson.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> his sickness encreasing, and with it his wondring that he could not in two months be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52051:14"/>
after his Physick taken, he thus wrote to the Earl, lamenting his own estate, and taxing the Earl of his forgetfulness of his weak estate; for his faith being thus shaken with the Earls unkindness, gave way for his judgement to scan those actions, rather like an understanding man, then a loving friend, as appeareth by his Letter sent to <hi>Rochester,</hi> the effect whereof was thus, as is averred by the depositions of Sir <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> servants, who saw the Letter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir, I wonder you have not yet found means to effect my delivery: but I remember you said you would be even with me</hi> (not suspecting, as it seemeth, any poysoning, but an unkind forgetfulness of my Lord of <hi>Rochester</hi>) <hi>and so you are indeed; but assure your self my Lord, if you do not release me, but suffer me me thus to dye, my blood will be required at your hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord comforts him, and excuses, that it cannot yet be compassed. Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> after the powder taken languished deadly, and to comfort him some followers of my Lord of <hi>Rochester</hi> are sent to him daily, in the name of my Lord, by the appointment and procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lady <hi>Essex</hi> (as <hi>VVeston</hi> confessed) to visit, and comfort him, and intreat him, if he desired any meats, he should speak, and it might better (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be provided for him then he should have any from the Tower. This was three moneths after his imprisonment.</p>
            <p>He, as men sick, desired luscious meats, Tarts and Jellies, which were provided by Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> with the knowledge of the said Countess, and sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, of which he did eat, the which Tarts were poysoned with <hi>Mercury sublimate,</hi> not being so well coloured as other Tarts are; and <hi>VVeston</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that he was straightly charged not to taste thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52051:15"/>Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> thus continuing languishing and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with the extremity of sickness untill 6. <hi>Septemb.</hi> then the aforesaid Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> did procure an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries boy for 20. l. to poyson a Glyster, which was by the boy and <hi>VVeston</hi> afterwards administred as good Physick upon 7. <hi>Octob.</hi> After the receipt of the Glyster, he fell into great extremity of vomiting and other purging, which left him not till it caused his soul to leave his poysoned body. This <hi>VVeston</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and signed.</p>
            <p>Being thus dead, he was presently and very unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verendly buried in a pit digged in a very mean place. On his body thus venomously infected appeared di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers blains and blisters, whereupon they to take away as well his good name as his life, did slanderously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that he dyed of the French Pox; but this report was cleared in Court by the depositions of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and other men of worth there read, that before his imprisonment he was a clear and sound body, only he had an Issue in his left arm purposely made for the benefit of his nature, for the avoiding of Rhume and ill humours, which with continual sitting at his study he had subjected himself unto. He further observed the confession of the Lieutenant to be, that if any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner dyed there, his body is to be viewed, and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to be taken by the Coroner.</p>
            <p>But Sir <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> friends and others might by no means be suffered to see his body, although it was reported that there was Inquisition taken, yet it could by no means be found.</p>
            <p>After Mr. Attorney had ended his speech, Mr. <hi>Warr</hi> also of Counsel for the King, declared to the Court what familiarity he had with Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> being both of the Temple together, much commending his singular honest and vertuous conversation, affirming that he was addicted to no dishonest actions; and from this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52051:15"/>
he proceeded to urge his hard usage in the Tower, where he might have no company but the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary and a Walloon, and repeating the sending of the Tarts and Jellies in my Lord of <hi>Somersets</hi> name, and ending his speech with this saying, <hi>Pereat unus ne pereant omnes; pereat peccans, ne pereat Respub.</hi> Then by the commandment of the Court were read by Mr. <hi>Fanshaw</hi> the examination of divers witnesses taken before the Lord Chief Justice and others, which in effect was as followeth.</p>

These examinations being read and applied to the purpose, the Lord Chief Justice said he would discharge his duty first to God, in giving all glory for the bringing to light of so horrible and wicked a fact; and next to the King (his great Master) who as in case of the like nature, in the case of <hi>Zanq.</hi> and <hi>Turner,</hi> so specially in this case hath given given streight charge of due and just examination to be had without any partiality or fear of the world; to the intent as well the innocent might be free, as the nocent and guilty severely punished.</p>
               <p>And for this purpose, his Majesty had with his owne hand written two sheets of paper on both sides, concerning Justice to be administred to all persons which were to be examined; which writing the Lord

Chief Justice shewed to the Lord Maior, and the rest of the Commissioners: and then he declared the Kings justice, who albeit the many favours and honors which his Majesty had bestowed upon the Lord of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> and his nearnesse to his person by reason of his office; yet he had committed him prisoner to the Dean of <hi>Westminster</hi> under the custody of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <hi>Fanshaw</hi> Clerk of the Crown, declared to him that he had been formerly arraigned, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not guilty: so he demanded of him how he would be tryed? whereunto the prisoner answered, by God and his Country; and thereupon the Jury being sworn, the Indictment being read, as before, Sir <hi>Lawr. Hide</hi> the Queens Attorney, being of the Councel for the King, having briefly rehearsed the effect of the Indictment, shewed how that he must necessarily mention others that were guilty of the same fact, wherein if any other man were touched, their cause it was, and not he that touched them.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>VVeston</hi> being but a stranger to Sir <hi>Tho Overbury,</hi> and one who by himself could reap no benefit by his death, it was against all reason he would do it himself, therefore (said he) I must needs open the whole plot; and having first declared the worth and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52051:19"/>
honesty of Sir <hi>Tho.

               <p>And afterwards the King intended for the honour and preferment of Sir <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> to send him upon an Ambassage; whereunto he was willing, but was dealt with, and perswaded by <hi>Rochester</hi> to disobey the Kings direction and counsel, with promises that he would bear him out; upon which contempt Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was committed to the Tower 22 <hi>April</hi> 1613. Sir <hi>William Wade</hi> heing Lieutenant of the Tower; and the 6. of <hi>May</hi> following, Sir <hi>William</hi> was removed, and Sir <hi>Ier. Elvis</hi> put in his place.</p>
               <p>And the very next day after, <hi>Weston</hi> by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of the Countesse, was preferred to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Lieutenant, and to be Keeper of Sir <hi>Tho.

               <p>He shewed how the very same day of his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Tower, he was sent for to the Countesse, who promised him that if he would give Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> a Water that should be delivered to him, he should be well rewarded; and she bad him not taste of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>And that the ninth or <hi>May</hi> aforesaid, the said wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was secretly sent from the Countesse to <hi>Weston</hi> by his son; and the same night <hi>Weston</hi> meeting the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, with Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s supper in one hand, and the Glasse in the other, he demanded of him, <hi>Sir, shall I give it him now?</hi> whereupon the Lieutenant took him aside, and disswaded him so far forth, that he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52051:20"/>
confessed he thanked God on his knees that he had met with him: But Mr. Attorney observed this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, that the Lieutenant did let him go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the poyson; and albeit he now denyeth he ever gave the poyson, yet said he did deliver it: He confesseth to Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> he had done it, saying, It made him very sick, and to vomit often, demanding of her his reward; she answered; he was not to have it till Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> was dead. Then he shewed, 30. <hi>Iune</hi> following a certain powder was sent in a Letter to Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> from <hi>Roch.</hi> perswading him not to fear, though it made him sick, for that should be his reason to move the King for his enlargement. And that the 14 <hi>Septemb. Weston</hi> and the Apothecary ministred the Glyster to Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> which gave him 60. stools and vomits, and that he dyed the next day, remembring the botches and blisters on his body being dead. He shewed how <hi>Weston</hi> came to Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> for his reward, which was deferied till his death; and that he had received in secret from the Countess by Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> at several times for his reward 180. l. and that the Apothecary had for his reward 20. l. all which <hi>Weston</hi> had confessed to be true.</p>
               <p>Then remembring how ignominiously they buried him, not suffering any to see him for fear he should be digged up again, and without any Coroners inquest that should be found: And thus he ended his speech.</p>
               <p>And all this opened and set forth by Mr. Attorney, Mr. <hi>VVar</hi> onely added thus much, which he desired the Jury to consider, that <hi>VVeston</hi> was servant to Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> when Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> was committed, and then he was entertained and made Keeper to Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving dispatched his business, Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> being dead and poysoned, he stayes no longer at the Tower, but returns again to his Mrs. <hi>Turner.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:52051:20"/>Then the Lord chief Justice exhorted the Jury to take God before their eyes, with equall balance to weigh as well the answer of the prisoner as the proofs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations against him, declaring unto them how qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly and freely he had examined him without any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing, or threatning, or rough usage, which the prisoner confessed; and my Lord, for matter of Law, satisfied the Jury, that albeit in the Indictment it be said to be <hi>Rosacar,</hi> white <hi>Arsnick, Mercury subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi> yet Jury were not to expect so precise proof in that point, shewing how impossible it were to convict a poysoner, who useth not to take any witnesses to the composing of this <hi>slibber sauces</hi>; wherefore he declares the Law in the like case, as if a man be indicted for murthering a man with a dagger, and it fall out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on evidence to have been done with a sword, or with a Rapier, or with neither, but with a staffe; in this case the instrument skilleth not, so that the Jury finde the murther; and so in the Prisoners case, if they would be satisfied of the poysoning, it skilleth not with what, therefore he required them to attend the proofes.</p>

Also <hi>VVeston</hi> told him that the Apothecary had 20. l. for giving the Glyster, and that he was poysoned with the Glyster.</p>
               <p>Hence was observed as well by the Court as the Queens Attorney, that <hi>VVeston</hi> was not single in his Confession; but whensoever he had confessed any thing in any of his Examinations, it was likewise confirmed by the Examination of others, as the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant and his son.</p>

               <p>SAith <hi>Weston</hi> being in his custody, he often per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him to put himself to be tryed by his Country, <hi>Weston</hi> telling him he would first kill himself, and ask God forgiveness afterwards: and said, he hoped they would not make a Net to catch little birds, and let the great ones go.</p>

                  </gap> conscience he never found a business prosecuted so by degrees, which were the ground of Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> his overthrow; he urged the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the examination of Sir <hi>David VVood,</hi> and shewed the reasons of the malice against him to be, for that he was so great an impediment to affections: then he made the dependency Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> had to the Lady, and <hi>Weston</hi> to Mrs. <hi>Turner,</hi> and how they all concluded to kill Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury</hi>; the like whereof (he said) our Fathers never saw before us: and he lamented much the place from whence the poyson came should be from the Court, the place (said he) from whence all men expected their safeties and protection. Lastly, he observed the finger of God even in this, that the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son had scarcely been suspected at all, or enquired after, had it not been for the extraordinary strange things appearing after his death; which was the first onely cause of suspicion and muttering.</p>
               <p>The evidence being given, <hi>VVeston</hi> was demanded what he could say for himself, who although he had before confessed all his examinations to be true, yet he seemed to excuse himself in a kinde of ignorance or unawares; he said he received the Glasse, and thought it was not good, but denied the giving of it to Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>: being demanded why he accused one
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52051:24"/>
                  <hi>Franklin</hi> for delivering to him the said Glasse from the Countess (from whom it was sent) he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed indeed it was to save his childe: And finally, could say nothing that had any colour of material or substantial point to excuse or argue innocency in him; so the Court referred him to the Jury, who went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and within short space returned, being agreed upon their verdict, and there at the Bar gave in, that <hi>VVeston</hi> was guilty of the fellonies of murthering and poysoning of Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury</hi>; and then the Clark of the Crown demanded of him what he could say for himself, why Judgement should not be pronounced against him according to the Law. To which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, he referred himself to my Lord and the Country; and then the Lord Chief Justice before he pronounced sentence of death, spake to this effect, That for the duty of the place he must say somewhat, and that to two several parties; first, to the auditory; secondly, to the prisoner; and that which he spake to the auditory, he divided into four parts, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 The manifestation of the glory of God, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the King.</item>
                     <item>2 The preventing of other damned crimes of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning.</item>
                     <item>3 Answer to certain objections.</item>
                     <item>4 That there is no practice of conspiracie in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of the business.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 For the first, he observed the finger of God in the manifestation, and bringing to light of this matter, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving slept two years, being shadowed with Greatness, which cannot overcome the cry of the people; he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served also the providence and goodness of God to put into the hearts of himself, &amp; the rest of the Judges the day of the last Arraigning, when the prisoner stood mute, not to give judgement against him for that time, but deferred it till now; and how in the mean
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52051:24"/>
time, it pleased his Majesty out of his gracious care and pity, to send to the prisoner, first the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> next the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> to admonish and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him for the saving of his soul, who after each of them had spent two hours with him, and when all the means of man not prevailing with him, it pleased God (when they had left him) to move his heart so, that now he did put himself to be tryed by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; by which means, using <hi>VVestons</hi> own words, he said, the greatest Flies shall not escape, but receive their punishment. For conclusion of this first point, he lastly observed, <hi>Divinum quiddam in vulgi opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nione,</hi> for that so many uncertain rumours touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this case, at last proved to be true.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he declared how for previntion of this damned crime of poysoning, Justice was the golden mean; and declared his Majesties resolution strictly to execute justice for that Treason, and he used this saying, <hi>Nemo prudens, &amp;c.</hi> and desired God that this president of <hi>Overburies</hi> might be an example, and terrour against this horrible crime; and therefore it might be called the great <hi>Oyer</hi> of Poysoning.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; he said that at the Arraignment were certain Critiques who had given out, the prisoner should deny his Examinations, and found so much fault for that the Examinations were read, the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner standing mute: but for the first, how untrue it was, all the world saw, the prisoner here confessing them all being read and shewed unto him. And for the second, besides that it was exceeding discreet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, the world should receive some satisfaction in a cause of that nature, he cited and shewed what by the Laws of the Land they ought and were bound to do, notwithstanding the greatness of any that might thereby be impeached, of whom he said, although this was <hi>Vnicum crimen,</hi> yet it was not <hi>unicus crimon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:52051:25"/>Fourthly, as touching the supposed practice or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracie, he solemnly protested to God he knew none, nor of any semblance or colour thereof; and therefore he much inveighed against the baseness and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of such as went about so untruly and wickedly to slander the course of Justice: and so he came last of all to that which he had to speak of <hi>Weston</hi> the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner.</p>
               <p>First, touching the wickedness of the fact, he very seriously exhorted him to an unfeined confession and contrition for the same; declaring unto him how that his confession would be a satisfaction to God and the world, if by faith and true repentance he would lay hold upon the merits of his Saviour. He perswaded him that no vain hope, (which is a witch) should keep him back from giving satisfaction to the world, by discovering the Great ones; assuring him that after this life, as death left him, so judgement should finde him.</p>
               <p>And lastly, taking occasion there to remember this poysoning to have been a Popish trick, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced by the example of <hi>Gurnandus di Birlanus</hi> mentioned 22 Ed. 1. <hi>Squire,</hi> that attempted to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Saddle; <hi>Lopez,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi>: and proceeded to give Judgement, which was, That the prisoner should be carried from thence to the place whence he came, and from thence to Tiburn, there to be hanged by the neck till he were dead.</p>
               <p>Justice being given, the Lord Chiefe Justice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that the prisoner might have convenient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and the company of some godly learned men to instruct him for his souls health.</p>

               <p>The Lord Chiefe Justice told her, that women must be covered in Church, and not when they are Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, and so caused her to put off her Hat; which done, she covered her hair with her handkerchiffe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before dressed in her hair, and her Hat over it.</p>

Lord Treasurer, for so they may tell my Father and Mother, and fill their ears full of toyes.</p>
               <p>There was also shewed in Court certain pictures of a man and woman in copulation made in Lead, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a mould of Brass, wherein they were cast: A black Scarf also full of white crosses, which Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> had in her custody. At the shewing of these and inchanted papers and other pictures in Court, there was heard a great crack from the Scaffolds, which caused a great fear, tumult, and confusion amongst the spectators, and throughout the Hall, every one fearing hurt, as though the Devil had been present, and growing angry to have his workmanship shown by such as were not his own schollers; and this terrour continuing about a quarter of an hour, silence proclaimed, the rest of the cunning tricks were likewise shewed. Doctor <hi>Formans</hi> wife being Administrix of her husband, found Letters in packets, by which much was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; she was in Court, and deposed, that Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> came to her house immediately after the death of her husband, and did demand certain pictures which were in her husbands study, namely one picture in wax, very sumptuously appareled in silk and sattins, as also one other picture sitting in form of a naked wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, spreading and laying forth her hair in a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glass, which Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> did confidently affirm to be in a box, and that she knew in what part of the study they were.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Forman</hi> further deposeth, that Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> and her husband would be sometimes three or four hours locked up in his study together: She did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose further, her husband had a Ring would open like a Watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:52051:27"/>There was also shewed a Note in Court made by Doctor <hi>Forman,</hi> and written in parchment, signifying what Ladies loved what Lords in the Court, but the Lord Chief Justice would not suffer it to be read in open Court.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> sent <hi>Margaret</hi> her Maid to Mrs. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and wished that all such Letters and papers as did concern the Earle of <hi>Somerset</hi> and the Countess of <hi>Essex</hi> should be burned, or any other great personages, telling her that the Councels Warrant should come to search the study, and that all his goods might be seised; whereupon she and her Maid <hi>Margaret,</hi> with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Mrs. <hi>Forman,</hi> burnt divers Letters and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, but that she kept some without their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie.</p>
               <p>There were also inchantments shewed in Court written in parchment, wherein were contained all the names of the blessed Trinity mentioned in the Scriptures; And in another Parchment Cross <hi>B.</hi> Cross <hi>C.</hi> Cross <hi>D.</hi> Cross <hi>E.</hi> in a third likewise in parchment were written all the names of the holy Trinity, as also a figure in which was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this word <hi>Christus,</hi> and upon the parchment was fastned a little piece of the skin of a man.</p>
               <p>In some of these parchments the Devils had parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular names, who were conjured to torment the Lord <hi>Somerset</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur Manwaring,</hi> if their loves should not continue, the one to the Countess, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi>; Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> also confessed, that Doctor <hi>Savorius</hi> was used in succession after <hi>Forman,</hi> and practised many sorceries upon the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> his person.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> being almost close prisoner in one of the Sheriffs houses in <hi>London,</hi> before she was brought to the Barr, knew not that <hi>Weston</hi> was executed; but by the proceedings having understanding thereof, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52051:28"/>
hearing divers examinations read, it so much dejected her, that in a manner she spake nothing for her self, also examinations and witnesses <hi>Viva voce</hi> that were produced at <hi>Westons</hi> arraignment, and divers others were read again, as the Examinations of <hi>Edward Paine, Io. VVright, Robert Freeman, Symcock Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, Payton, VVilliams</hi>: one of these Examinations gave in evidence, that one <hi>Franklyn</hi> being an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary and Drugster, was the provider of all the poysons given to Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Chyrurgeon there deposed, that he cured <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn</hi> of the Pox, and that at several times he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of his Chyrurgion what was the strongest poyson. The Chyrurgeon demanded what he would do with it, <hi>Franklyn</hi> replyes, Nothing but for his experience, and to try conclusions.</p>
               <p>Another Examination of one <hi>Merser</hi> who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the said <hi>Franklyn,</hi> calling him Cousen, who demanded of the examinant, What news? he answered, Ill newes: I am sorry that my old Lord and Masters son is found insufficient, and not able to content the Lady. <hi>Franklyn</hi> replyes, I have a hand in that business, I have a great friend of my Lady <hi>Essex,</hi> she allows me 2. s. 6. d. a day for my Boat-hire, and 10. s. a week for my dyet, I could have any money if I would. <hi>Merser</hi> replyes, but Cousin, how can God bless you in this business? <hi>Franklyn</hi> answered, Let them talk of God that have to do with him: my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi> and the Countess will bear me out in any thing I do; if you have any suit wherein you may do your self any good, and I may gain by it, I will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you I will get it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Francis</hi> deposeth, that <hi>Franklyn</hi> married his sister, and that he thinketh in his conscience she was poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned; upon some discontentment he heard him say,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52051:28"/>
he would not be hanged for never a whore or quean of them all. The Lord Chief Justice made a speech upon divers examinations there read, that the Earl of <hi>Somerset</hi> gave directions, that of the powder he sent to Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> that which should be left should be brought back again, his pretext was that it should make him sick, which should be the ground to make the King grant his liberty, saying further, it would do him good: and he had Tarts and Jellies sent him likewise by the Countess, with express command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that none must eate of them but Sir <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> saying, they would do him no harm.</p>
               <p>At another time the Countess sent Tarts, Jellies, and VVine, with directions that those which had been formerly sent, should be brought back again, and those last brought should be given him at supper, and then all should be well; but directions given that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Lieutanant nor his wife might eate of them, but they might drink of the wine, for in the Tarts and Jellies there might be letters, but in the wine none; and afterwards it was openly related and proved by divers examinations, that those words <hi>Letters</hi> were private tokens between the Countess and the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and <hi>Weston</hi> to give notice what things were poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, and what not.</p>
               <p>In the Examination that was of <hi>VVeston,</hi> it was related, that Mr. <hi>Iames</hi> told him that the Earl his Master would pay him for his pains taken with Sir <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> Then the Lord Chief Justice gave in charge to the Jury concerning the evidence they had formerly told them, and heard that <hi>VVeston</hi> at his Examination confessed all he had said formerly was true.</p>
               <p>He further related what a great vexation and grief it was to the King, that <hi>Somerset</hi> onely by making use of his favours and love, so foul a fact was done, as
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52051:29"/>
first to be the occasion to put Sir <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments for the Embassage of <hi>Russia.</hi> 2. To make him refuse them, and to give right cause for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment. 3. To bear him in hand that he would work his liberty, but still aggravated and laboured the contrary, and gave directions to the Lieutenant to look surely to him, and to keep him close prisoner, and that he should send to none of his friends, or they to him, urging great matters against him.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Tho. Monson</hi> was often employed to give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to the Lieutenant therein, a most bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous course to be so dealt withall onely for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; concluding that Sir <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> was a close prisoner to all his friends, but open to all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; such as <hi>Somerset</hi> would have, or send to him.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Justice told Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> she had the seven deadly sins, <hi>viz.</hi> a Whore, a Bawd, a Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer, a Murtherer, a Witch, a Papist, a Felone, the daughter of the Devil: <hi>Forman</hi> wishing her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and to become the servant of Jesus Christ, and to pray him to cast out those seven Devils. She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires the Lord Chief to be good to her, saying, she was ever brought up with the Countess of <hi>Somerset,</hi> and had been of a long time her servant, and knew not there was poyson in any of those things sent to Sir <hi>Tho. Overb.</hi> then the Jury went forth, and not long after returned, finding her guilty, who being asked what she could say for her self why judgement should not be pronounced against her, she onely desired favour, but could not speak any thing for weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Then Judge <hi>Crook</hi> made another grave Speech, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting her to repentance, and to prepare her self ready for death, and that the little time which should be assigned her to live, she should not spend it either
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52051:29"/>
in labour or imagination to get her life, for that hope was but a VVitch: upon conclusion of which Speech he gave Judgement, and told her she had a very hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Tryall by such men as he had not seen in his time for one of her rank and quality, and so was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Sheriff.</p>
               <p>Upon the wednesday following she was brought from the Sheriffs in a Coach to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and was there put into a Cart, and casting money often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the people as she went, she was carried to <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi> where she was executed, and whither many men and women of fashion came in Coaches to see her dye, to whom she made a speech, desiring them not to rejoyce at her fall, but to take example by her: she exhorted them to serve God, and abandon ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and all other sins, relating her breeding with the Countess of <hi>Somerset,</hi> having had no other means to maintain her self and her children, but what came from the Countess; And said further, that when her hand was once in this business, she knew the revealing of it would be her overthrow; by which, with other like speeches, and great peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence there shewed, she moved the Spectators to great pitty and grief for her.</p>

            <p>The Countess writ a Letter to the Lieutenant, with the Letter she sent poysoned Tarts to <hi>Overbury,</hi> and Wine to the Lieutenants wife, and bad him give the Tarts to <hi>Overbury,</hi> for there were Letters in them; but his wife and children might drink the Wine, for she was sure there were no Letters in it.</p>

I answered, they mean to refine you, that your pureness may appear the better: after I walked with him in his Chamber, and advised him to give way to the match between <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> and the Countess, but then he grew hot against your Lordship, and the Countess of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> saying if
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52051:31"/>
he were the Countess of <hi>Suffolks</hi> prisoner (as he thought he was) then (said he) let her know that I care as little to dye, as she to be cruel. The Countess I finde to be joyned with you in this plot, though the Chamberlain knows not of it, nor any one else: but <hi>Rochesters</hi> part I shall most fear untill I see the event to be clearly conveyed: and so he concluded his Letter.</p>
            <div type="letter">
               <head>The Answer of Sir <hi>Jervas Elvis</hi> to the points proposed.</head>
               <p>MY Lord, before I answer the matter of charge against me, let me remember your Lordship of one speech I learned from your mouth, I have heard you speak it at the Councel Table, and at the Assizes in the Country; that when a prisoner stands at the Bar for his life comfortless, allowed no counsel, but strong counsel against him, perchance affrighted with the fear of death, his wife and his children to be cast out of doors, and made to seek their bread, you have alwayes pitied the cause of such an one, you have protested you had rather hang in hell for mercy to such an one, then for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>My Lord, you have not observed your own rule in my cause, you have paraphrased upon every examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you have aggravated every evidence, and applied it to me; so that I stand clearly condemned, before I be found guilty: if I were so vile a man as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship conceives me, I were unworthy of any favour, but I hope your Lordship shall not finde it.</p>
               <p>So I will deny nothing that hath evidence of truth against me; I will not tell a lie to save my life: and beseech your Lordship so to conceive of me, move your charity towards me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:52051:32"/>Then desired he the Court, that the heads of the Accusations might be collected by the Councel of the King, which were the same which were mentioned before, to which he severally answereth:</p>
               <p>To the first, <hi>Shall I give him now?</hi> he answered, That when <hi>Weston</hi> asked him the question, he saw no poyson in his hand and therefore (said he) in <hi>Westons</hi> and my Examinations the question was, <hi>Shall I give it him now?</hi> not, <hi>Shall I give him this now?</hi> for there is a great difference between <hi>hoc,</hi> and <hi>id,</hi> in matters of prevention.</p>
               <p>But further, when <hi>Weston</hi> had told me that it was poyson which he meant to give, I reproved him, and beat him down with Gods Judgements: nay I humbled him so, that he thanked God and me on his knees, and told me that he and his had cause to blesse God for me, for that I with-held him from doing that act; and if you call this comforting and abetting, to terrifie a man for his sins, and to make him confess his faults to God, and to abhor and detest the act, then was I an abettor, and comforter of <hi>Weston.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the second, after I had thus terrified him with Gods Judgements, and saw him cast down for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I could do him no better office then to raise him up, who was thus cast down, and therefore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured him; I shewed him kindness, I drank to him, to the intent <hi>I</hi> might encourage the intentions of his minde, which <hi>I</hi> found then in abhorring the fact; and for that <hi>I</hi> gave him no wages, it is true; <hi>I</hi> took him from the commendations of my Lord of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho. Monson,</hi> whom <hi>I</hi> took to be my friends, and thought they would commend no man to be a Keeper, which might endamage me.</p>
               <p>To the third, <hi>I</hi> never knew any other meaning of the Countesses words in her Letters, but the bare li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral meaning; and sure (quoth he) after <hi>I</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52051:32"/>
the Tarts, and they stood a while in my Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, saw them so black and foul, and of such strange colours, that <hi>I</hi> did cause my Cook to throw them away and to make other Tarts for him.</p>
               <p>To the fourth he saith, the Earle of <hi>Northamptons</hi> Letter to him, was not any thing touching the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> but for a close re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, to the end that <hi>Overbury</hi> might agree to their purposes concerning the marriage to be had between <hi>Rochester</hi> and the Countess: if the Earle of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton</hi> had any plot to take away his life, <hi>I</hi> was not of his counsel, nor had knowledge therein.</p>
               <p>To the fifth, it is said, <hi>I</hi> received him according to my instructions; <hi>I</hi> meant no other thing then <hi>I</hi> had delivered before, which was concerning the closeness of his imprisonment; but being asked what he meant by these words, <hi>Rochesters part I shall greatly fear, untill I see the event to be clearly carried</hi>: In this he staggered and wavered much, and gave his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, It was long since <hi>I</hi> writ this Letter, and for the particular circumstance that induced me to this speech, <hi>I</hi> cannot now call to memory: but sure <hi>I</hi> am, (knowing my self to be innocent) <hi>I</hi> satisfie my remembrance, so that <hi>I</hi> meant nothing concerning the taking away of his life: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>I</hi> was a stranger to <hi>Rochester,</hi> and had heard, and known of that great league that was between them, <hi>I</hi> might well think, suspect, and fear whether he would alwayes continue those projects for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint. These were the answers he made to his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations: and after he had made many protestations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and his soul of innocency, in the mallicious plotting and abetting of <hi>Overburies</hi> death, he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himself to the Jury, and said,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> will prove unto you by many infallible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable reasons, that <hi>I</hi> could not be aider and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotter
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52051:33"/>
with <hi>Weston</hi> in this poysoning: first, <hi>I</hi> made a free and voluntary discovery of it my self, <hi>I</hi> was not compelled; will any man imagine <hi>I</hi> would discover a thing wherein <hi>I</hi> am not able to clear my self? Nature is more kinde then to be its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser.</p>
               <p>Besides, that my clearness might more appear and remain in the world without any suspition, <hi>I</hi> proceeded and accused the murtherer <hi>Weston.</hi> It had been a senselesse thing in me (if <hi>I</hi> had not thought my self clear) to have accused him, who might have done as much for me. Nay <hi>Weston</hi> himself proved me to be an honest man before the Chancellour of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, for he confessed to him and others being present, that he thought the Lieutenant knew not of the poyson; and in his Examination before the Lord Chief Justice, and Serjeant <hi>Crew,</hi> being asked the meaning of those words (<hi>Shall I give it him now?</hi>) he answered, That he thought that those which had set him on work, had acquainted the Lieutenant with their plot.</p>
               <p>And also <hi>I</hi> was so confident in mine own innocency, that <hi>I</hi> told my Lord Chief Justice, and my Lord <hi>Zouch,</hi> that the way to make <hi>Weston</hi> confess, and to discover all, was by fair and gentle intreaty of him; and so by this means they might search to the very bottome of his heart: in this the Lord Chief Justice witnessed with him.</p>
               <p>And after Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was dead, <hi>Weston</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> were sent to me to know whether <hi>I</hi> had any inkling of the death of Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>: what need they have made this question, if <hi>I</hi> had known any thing thereof?</p>
               <p>Also that which <hi>I</hi> do know concerning the poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> was after his death by the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Weston</hi>; and <hi>I</hi> am here indicted as accessary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52051:33"/>
the fact, when <hi>I</hi> knew nothing till after the fact.</p>
               <p>After that he had confirmed these reasons by sundry-proofs and witnesses, he went further in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. If <hi>I</hi> be in the plot, my Lord Treasurer is, <hi>I</hi> have his Letter to shew in it, he called me to his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and said, The plots you know them as well as I. The plots were onely to repair her honor: my wife hath the Letters from the Lord Treasurer and <hi>Munson</hi>: for these plots <hi>I</hi> will run willingly to my death, if circumstances be knit with any manner of fact.</p>
               <p>He proceeded further, and told the Lord Chief Justice, that he spake not this to justifie himself, so that no blemish or stain might cleave unto him, for (said he) this visitation is sent me from God, and whether <hi>I</hi> live or dye, it is the happiest affliction to my soul that <hi>I</hi> ever received: <hi>I</hi> have laid open my whole heart from blood guiltiness, <hi>I</hi> have not repented me other then for errors of my judgement in not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting what <hi>I</hi> suspected, and yet <hi>I</hi> ask God forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for less sins, but of this <hi>I</hi> know no other then the gross error of my judgement in not preventing it, when <hi>I</hi> saw such intendment and imagination against him.</p>
               <p>Then he put my Lord Chief Justice this question: If one that knoweth not of any plot to poyson a man, but onely suspecteth, is no actor or contriver himself, onely imagineth such a thing, whether such a one be accessary to the Murther? for the words of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are <hi>abetting and comforting with malice.</hi> Now if there be any man that charges me expresly or in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tearms that <hi>I</hi> was an abetter; or if the Court shall think fit in this case that <hi>I</hi> have put, that such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing without malice in an abetting, <hi>I</hi> refuse not to dye; <hi>I</hi> am guilty: this was the summe of his speech.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:52051:34"/>Then the Lord Chief Justice replyed, That to his knowledge he spake no more concerning the evidence then he could in conscience justifie, which was onely to explain the evidence, and not wresting any thing in prejudice of his life.</p>
               <p>But further, he told him, that two dayes before Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> dyed, you wished his man to bring in his best Sute of hangings to hang his Chamber, which you knew were your Fees: after he told him that his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation of the Lord Treasurer was very malicious; for in all the Examinations he had taken, in all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act search he could make for the finding out of the truth; he saw not that honourable Gentleman any way touched. In conclusion, he told him, It is not your deep protestations, and your appealing to God and his Throne, that can sway a Jury from their evidence, which is not answered unto.</p>
               <p>But to leave you without excuse, and to make the matter as clear as may be; here is the Confession of <hi>Franklin,</hi> which he then drew out of his bosome, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, This poor man not knowing S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Iervis</hi> should come to his Triall, this morning he came unto me at five of the clock, and told me that he was much troubled in his conscience, and could not rest all night, untill he made his Confession, and it is such an one (these were his words) as the eye of <hi>England</hi> never saw, nor the ear of Christendome ever heard.</p>

               <p>MIstress <hi>Turner</hi> came to me from the Countess, and wished me from her to get the strongest poyson I could for S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Th. Overbury</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I brought seven sorts; <hi>Aqua-fortis, White-Arsnick, Mercury, Great-spiders, Powder</hi> of <hi>Diamonds, Lapis Costitus, Cantarides</hi>; all these were given to Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> at several times: and further confesseth, that the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant knew of these poysons; for that appeared (said he) by many Letters which he writ to the Countess of <hi>Essex,</hi> which <hi>I</hi> saw, and thereby knew that he knew of that matter; one of them I read for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess, because she could not read it her self, in which the Lieutenant used this speech: <hi>Madam,</hi> This Scab is like the Fox, the more he is cursed, the better he fareth: and other speeches.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> never eat white Salt, but there was <hi>White-Arsnick</hi> put into it; once he desired Pigge, and Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> put into it <hi>Lapis Costitus</hi>; the white powder that was sent Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> in a Letter, he knew to be <hi>White-Arsnick,</hi> a very deadly poyson.</p>
               <p>At another time he had two Partridges sent him from the Court, and water and onyons being the sawce, Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> instead of Pepper put in <hi>Canta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides,</hi> so that there was scarce any thing that he did eat but there was some poyson in it; for these poysons the Countess sent me rewards, she sent me gold many times by Mrs. <hi>Turner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She afterward writ unto me to buy her more poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: <hi>I</hi> went to her, and told her, <hi>I</hi> was weary of it: <hi>I</hi> besought her upon my knees, that she would use
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52051:35"/>
me no more in these matters; but she importuned me, bid me go, and inticed me with fair speeches and rewards; so she overcame me, and did bewitch me.</p>
               <p>The cause of this poysoning was, as the Countess told me, because Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> would pry so far into the state, as he would put them down: he did also say, that the toothless Maid trusty <hi>Margaret</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the poyson: so was Mrs.<hi>Turners</hi> man <hi>Stephen,</hi> so also Mrs. <hi>Horn,</hi> the Countesses own hand.</p>
               <p>He saith, on the marriage of the Countess with <hi>Somerset</hi>; she sent him twenty pound by Mrs. <hi>Turner,</hi> and he was to have been paid by the Countesse two hundred pound <hi>per. an.</hi> during his life.</p>
               <p>That he was urged and haunted two hundred seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times at the least by the Countesse to do it against his conscience: he saith, she was able to bewitch any man: and then he wrought the love between <hi>Rochester</hi> and her, and that he had twelve severall Letters from her to prosecute it, and was to have two hundred pound, to continue their love till the Marriage.</p>
               <p>These are all the materials in <hi>Franklins</hi> Confession; to this Sir <hi>Iervis</hi> knew not what to answer, or to make of his own Letters.</p>
               <p>Then presently the Jury departed from the Bar, and presently after returned, and found him guilty, and the Lord Chief Justice gave judgement, and he was executed accordingly in manner following.</p>

               <head>Sir <hi>Jervas</hi> his Confession.</head>
               <p>ON Munday the 20. of <hi>Novem.</hi> 1615. he was executed upon Tower hill, upon a Gibbet there set up of purpose about six of the clock in the morning (he being arraigned in a black Suit and Jerkin with hanging sleeves, having on his head a crimson satten Cap, from the top downwards, and round about laced, under that a white linnen Cap, with a border, and over that a black Hat with a broad Ribbond, and a ruffe Band thick couched with a lace, and a pair of skie-coloured silk stockings, and a pair of three soaled shooes.)</p>
               <p>He came on foot from Sheriffe <hi>Goars</hi> house to the Gibbet, between Dr. <hi>Whiting,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Felton,</hi> two of his Majesties Chaplains, and comming to the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders foot, he talked a word or two to the Executioner; then he went up the Ladder four or five steps, the Executioner sitting over his head upon the top the of the Gibbet; Sir <hi>Iervis</hi> finding the Ladder to stand too upright, for his case, spake to have it amended; which forthwith he comming down was done, being fastned in the ground, and then he went up again six steps, where after a while sitting, uttered to this, or the like effect.</p>
               <p>NOble, Right worshipful, and others: I am here come as well to shew, explain, and unfold that which passed at the time of my Arraignment, to so many of you as were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; as also to shew that there <hi>I</hi> perceived <hi>I</hi> had lost the good opinion of many in standing so long upon mine innocencie, which was my fault <hi>I</hi> confess, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52051:36"/>
now to recover the same, and your good chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table opinions of me; which fault <hi>I</hi> then saw not, being blinded with my own error, which made me account it no sin.</p>
               <p>But since my condemnation, by the means and help of these two Gentlemen here present (the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors) <hi>I</hi> was perswaded of the greatness of my sin, and that it was so much the greater, by how much the more <hi>I</hi> did conceal it: which by Gods mercy <hi>I</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, consulted not with flesh and blood, but thought it in this my condemnation the best way for my souls health to reveal to the Omnipotent and All-seeing God, the most secret and inward intentions and thoughts of my deceitfull heart; not once respecting the praises or dispraises of the world, which <hi>I</hi> regard not at all.</p>
               <p>It may not be some will say, That this place was most unfit for my execution, appointed to terrifie and daunt me so much the more; but (alas!) <hi>I</hi> fear not death, place, nor any such like thing; for <hi>I</hi> account it the King and Councels speciall favour, that <hi>I</hi> dye here, for that J requesting the same it was granted, whereby J see now this Tower, late wherein J should have been called to State business, and still might, if J had performed a more loyal service to my King and Country then J did.</p>
               <p>Next, in that J was not appointed to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> a place of more publique reproach then now J am brought to, being worthy to die by due and lawfull Justice, in prosecuting this bloody enormous act against a kind Gentleman, who deserved no ill at my hands, nor any mans else, for ought J know.</p>
               <p>But were it J had not trusted him who was a most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious wretch, J had not fallen into this shame, which may warn all here present to take heed whom they
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52051:36"/>
trust in a bad matter; and to admonish you that are trusted never to break honest and just fidelity.</p>
               <p>I was by divers tricks drawn to this action, which I received from the Earle of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Monson,</hi> and none other; but had I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the 115. verse of the 119. Psalm, and said with the holy Prophet, <hi>Away from me ye wicked, for I will keep the commandements of my God</hi>: Then had J re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused such like tricks, alas! now too late, there was my fault that J did not refuse them, and cast my self upon Gods providence without any dependence on man, though never so honourable: Was ever any deceived that did trust in God? there was never any: Therefore J admonish you all, let none how honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able soever they be, or the King himself, move you to any thing not agreeable to Gods word; do it not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it; for that was my fault, that J had not at the first opened this plot to his Majesty, who no doubt would most justly and throughly have punished the same.</p>
               <p>You Noble, Worshipful, and others; let my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample teach you thus much, That you prophane not the holy Sabbaths of the Lord, nor his good creatures, nor that you turn (by a lascivious course) dayes into nights, and nights into dayes, as J have done; and that in serving God, you must not only read the Scriptures, but joyn practice therewith; for what good will the same effect, if the heart be foul, bloody, and impure? some here knew my forwardness therein, but J pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not innocencie that way, but cast it off, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that of this great Assembly <hi>I</hi> am the most wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched sinner.</p>
               <p>You expect speeches from me of some concealed mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and upon some of my speeches used at the closing up of my Arraignment; but J stand here <hi>loco pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52051:37"/>
non oratoris</hi>: yet J will shew you that J have ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to my Lord Chrief Justice since my Arraignment, that with the utmost of my power J was able to verifie, upon which J took the body and blood of Jesus Christ, and in further testimony, J will now seal it with my last and dearest breath.</p>
               <p>Nobles, and others, to see your faces it rejoyceth me, whereby you manifest your loves in granting my request to be eye-witnesses of my death: J see a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of my friends here, (pointing as he spake) who out of their loves J intreated to beseech God to strengthen me in death, though ignominious to some, yet to me a bitter cup mingled with Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, a special favor this way to call me home; whereas he might have taken away my life by shooting the Bridge, or some fall, or otherwise; and then this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented sin, which J accounted no sin (such was my blindness) had been damnation to me; for God is just, and the unrepented sinner shall have no salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>There is none of you here present that knoweth how or in what sort he shall dye, it may be in his bed, it may be otherwise (God knows) J protest before you all, J never came over this hill in the chiefest of all my prosperity with more joy then now J have at this present; for now J know J shall behold the glorious face and sight of my Creator.</p>
               <p>Take heed, let my ensample incite you to serve God truly and uprightly, lest a shameful death over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take you, as it hath me, who am unworthy of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents care in bringing me up.</p>
               <p>Jt may be some will say, J have a flinty heart, because J shed no tears; my heart is flesh as others be, and J am as faint-hearted to look death in the face as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers because my use hath not been to shed tears, J can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52051:37"/>
now easily, except it be for the losse of some dear freind; albeit now my heart beginneth to melt within me being wounded (with that the tears stood in his eyes) to see the faces of some here present, whom J most earnestly love, and now must depart from with shame, though worldly regard J respect not, for well Mr. Sheriffe knows, that (to shame this my sinful flesh the more) J wisht if it had him pleased, to have been brought thorow the City, to have warned all the spectators how they should not escape without Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for blood, for God is just.</p>
               <p>J had almost forgotten to shew you a most strange thing which God brought to my memory the last night, which is this: J confess J have been a great Gamester, and have played and wasted many great summes of money which exhausted a great part of my means, which J perceiving, vowed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously, and not sleightly or unadvisedly, to the Lord in my vow and prayers, <hi>Lord, let me be hanged if ever I play any more</hi>! which not long after is justly come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, whereof ye are all eye-witnesses, for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times since J have broke this my vow.</p>
               <p>Then he espied one Sir <hi>Maxamilian Dalyson</hi> stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to the Gibbet on horse-back, and said to him, You know Sir <hi>Maxamilian</hi> what gaming we have had, and how we have turned dayes into nights, and nights into dayes: J pray you in time to leave it off, and dishonor God no more in breaking his Sabbath, for he hath alwayes enough to punish, as you now see me, who little thought thus to dye.</p>
               <p>To which Sir <hi>Maxamilian</hi> answered him, Sir <hi>Iervas,</hi> J am much gieved for you, and shall never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what you have said; whereunto he said, Look to it, do then.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:52051:38"/>Further he continued his Speech, Let no man boast of the abilities and gifts of Nature which God giveth him, for therein I displeased God, being over-much transported with the pride of my Pen, which obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious Quill of mine procured my just overthrow. Upon the knitting up of my Lord Chief Justices Speech at my Arraignment, by reason of two or three passages at the bottom of my Letter, subscribed with my own hand, which I utterly had forgotten, because I felt not my fin, (which <hi>I</hi> heard;) <hi>I</hi> saw no other but the finger of God would thus point to this Fact: By this means, <hi>I</hi> do protest before God, and confess before you all, that <hi>I</hi> was so overtaken with this bloody Fact, that for satisfaction of the same, <hi>I</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly yeelded my dearest blood, to the shame of this my wretched Carkass, not being so much grieved for the same, as for others; that <hi>I</hi> wish <hi>I</hi> had hang'd in Chaines perpetually, so that <hi>I</hi> had at first revealed this hainous plot.</p>
               <p>Then should <hi>I</hi> have saved the lives of some already dead, some in the Tower, and some in the City, some over Seas; so should <hi>I</hi> have prevented many from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Widdows, some from being fatherless, and some from being childless, among whom my own wife for one, and eight Fatherless children of mine, which <hi>I</hi> now leave behind me; and God knows how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are guilty of this Fact, and when it will bee ended.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Justice upon closing up of my speeches at my Arraignment, said, <hi>I</hi> was a <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptist</hi>: <hi>I</hi> would I were as clear from all other sins, as from that, for <hi>I</hi> alwayes detested that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>As for my wife, some said she is a <hi>Papist</hi>; True it is, she came so short of a sincere <hi>Protestant. I</hi> mean
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52051:38"/>
in that respect, that when she is amongst <hi>Papists,</hi> she cannot well forbear them.</p>
               <p>Then he spake to the Sheriff, saying, If it may be permitted without offence, <hi>I</hi> have somewhat to say, and that is this; Is it lawful for any one here to demand of me any questions? to which the Sheriff answered, It is not lawfull, wherefore, good Sir <hi>Iervas,</hi> quoth he, forbear. Sir <hi>Iervas</hi> said there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, (doubling his words) it is enough, it is enough; <hi>I</hi> have, quoth he, one that holdeth my cloak, may <hi>I</hi> bestow somewhat on him? The Sheriff answered, That you may Sir; whereupon, he called the young man unto him by his name, who stood waiting at the Ladders foot, and gave him out of his pocket some pieces of gold or silver, and said, Here, take this, spend it; which he with bitter tears thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Felton</hi> and Doctor <hi>Whiting</hi> strained cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie which of them should begin a publike Prayer for this parties condition; one of them willed the other, but at last Doctor <hi>VVhiting</hi> said, If you Sir <hi>Iervas</hi> can perform it your self, you of all men are fittest to do it, with efficacy both of soul and spirit; whereupon he said, <hi>I</hi> shall do my best then; but my hearers, <hi>I</hi> crave your charitable constructions, if with half words, and imperfect speeches, <hi>I</hi> chatter like a Crane.</p>

               <p>As soon as he had then said audibly, <hi>Lord Iesus receive my soule,</hi> which belike was the Executioners watch-word, he turn'd him off the Ladder, and the Executioners man catching at one of his feet, and his own man by the other, they suddenly weighed his life; where hanging a small distance of time, his body not once stirred, onely his hands moved a little, being tyed with a black silk Ribbon, which a little before he had reached to the Executioner, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up his hands to him for that purpose; all which being ended, both Corps high Gibbet were from thence conveyed.</p>

               <p>HE confesseth, That in a house near <hi>Doctors Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Mistriss <hi>Turner</hi> did first come unto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the poysoning of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> and prayed him to provide that which should not kill a man presently, but lie in his body a certain time, wherewith he might languish away by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; at the same time she gave him four Angels, wherewith he bought a water called <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and sent it to Mistriss <hi>Turner,</hi> who to try the operation
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52051:41"/>
thereof, gave it to a Cat, wherewith the Cat lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, crying pitifully for two days, and so dyed.</p>
               <p>Afterwards Mistriss <hi>Turner</hi> sent for <hi>Francklin</hi> to come to the Countess, who told him that <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> was too violent a Water: But what think you, quoth she, of White <hi>Arsnick?</hi> He told her, that was too violent: What say you, quoth she, to Powder of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds? He answered, I know not the Nature of that; She said then, he was a Fool, and gave him pieces of Gold, and bid him buy some of that Powder for her: <hi>Francklin</hi> demanded of the Countess what was her Reason to poyson Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury</hi>; she told him, He would pry so far into their estate, that he would overthrow them all.</p>
               <p>A little before Sir <hi>Tho.

               <p>Also a fortnight after <hi>Westons</hi> Apprehension, this Countess sent for <hi>Francklin</hi> into S. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Park, where he, the Earl, and the Countess walking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and as soon as he came, the Earl went apart into a Chamber, then she told him, <hi>Weston</hi> hath been sent for by a Pursevant, and hath confessed all, and we shall be hanged; but on your life, quoth she, do
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52051:41"/>
not you confess that you brought any Poyson to me or to Mris <hi>Turner,</hi> for if you do, you shall be hanged, for I will not hang for you; nor, saith Mris <hi>Turner,</hi> will I hang for you both.</p>
               <p>The Countess told him, The Lord who was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine him would promise him a pardon to confess, but beleeve them not, for they will hang thee when all is done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Weston</hi> came to <hi>Francklins</hi> House, and told, Now the Countess turn is served, she uses him unkindly, and they should both be poysoned, and that two were set on purpose to poyson him. <hi>Francklin</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving confessed his former Examination under his own hand, being permitted to speak for himself, said, That at the intreaty of the Countess and Mistriss <hi>Turner,</hi> he did buy the Poysons, but protested his Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance what they meant to do with them, and for the rest he referred to the Conscience of the Jury, who went from the Bar, and within a quarter of an hour did return and pronounce him guilty: Then Judg <hi>Crook</hi> after a brief Exhortation gave the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death upon him. The Lord Chief Justice made a short Exhortation also with addition of these words, that knowing as much as he knew, if this had not been found out, neither Court, City, nor any particular Families had escaped the malice of this wicked cruelty.</p>

            <p>WHen he came to the Bar, he made a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord Chief <hi>Iustice,</hi> That whereas he had written to his Lordship to ask the Lord Treasurer two Questions, which my Lord would do; He desired then an Answer, and that Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> might be present; the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on read, he was indicted for Conspiracy with <hi>Weston</hi> for poysoning Sir <hi>Tho.

            <p>For <hi>VVeston</hi> and Mistriss <hi>Turner</hi> dyed penitently, as it is worthy to be written in letters of Gold; and for the Lievtenant, though with great Imprecations and with high hand he denyed it, yet to the great Glory of the Kings Justice he dyed most penitently and resolutely: This is spoken to the great Praise of God, that hath crowned these just Proceedings, <hi>Iustitia confirmata non est Authoritate,</hi> though not having Reason for it, wherein we may see the great Hand of God. For that morning the Lievtenant was Arraigned came to me as one afflicted in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, not knowing of his Arraignment, one with Evidence against him, which he delivered to the Iury, one of them heard him say (<hi>the Lord have mercy upon me,</hi>) and for this present (<hi>non est constantia longa de vita hominis</hi>) therefore he must be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Tower as a safer place, till further order be taken.</p>
            <p>Then he addressed his Speech to Sir <hi>Thomas Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> saying, Whereas you name my Lord Treasurer, every mans fame is dear unto him, and he hath been dear and Honorable; you shall hear what he hath answered to my Letter.</p>
            <p>After my hearty Commendations, I hear that Sir <hi>Thomas Monson</hi> that I can clear him, but I hear nothing of him to accuse him, but I hope he is not guilty of so great a crime.</p>
            <p>

               <head>The Names and form of their sitting.</head>
               <p>WHen my Lord Chancellor, who for his time was High Steward of <hi>England,</hi> came into the Court, there came before him six Sergeants at Arms with their <hi>Maces,</hi> Sir <hi>Geo. Coppin</hi> with his Pattent, Sir <hi>Rich. Connisby</hi> with his White Staff, Mr <hi>Mannering</hi> with the Great Seal, he himself at the upper end of the Board sitting under a Cloth of State, of both hands of him the Peers, under them the Iudges, at the further end of the Kings Councel below the Iudges, on one side, <hi>Finch</hi> the Keeper of Records of Attainders, the Clerk of the Crown and his Deputy in the midst of the Court, the Sergeant Cryer standing by him; Sir <hi>Rich. Connisby,</hi> Sir <hi>Geo. Coppin</hi> the Seal-Bearer, and at my Lord Stewards feet the <hi>Prisoner</hi> at a Bar, behind the Kings Councel the Lievtenant of the Tower in a little space adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Bar.</p>
               <p>All being silent, Sir <hi>Geo. Coppin</hi> arises, delivers the Pattent to the <hi>Lord High Steward,</hi> upon his knee, he received it, and kisseth it, and returns it to Mr <hi>Fanshaw,</hi> who takes it kneeling; then the Sergeant Cryer makes Proclamation in the Lord High Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards name to keep silence; then Mr <hi>Fanshaw,</hi> (which bears date <hi>May</hi> 10.) Then there is another O <hi>Yes</hi> to certifie my L. <hi>Steward,</hi> whether <hi>Weston</hi> were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as principal for the murther of Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury</hi>: Then the Lord Chief Iustice delivers a Schedule indorsed with Certificates of four Iudges of the Kings Bench, and other the Commissioners; then <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi> turning unto my Lord Steward reads a third <hi>O Yes</hi> for certifying other Indictments. My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> delivers another Schedule, indorsed with Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate of my Lady of <hi>Somersets</hi> Indictment, which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52051:45"/>
Mr <hi>Fanshaw</hi> as before reads. A fourth <hi>O Yes</hi> for <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Lee</hi> Serjeant at Arms to return the Precept for the Peers of <hi>Frances</hi> Countess of <hi>Somerset,</hi> which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he, after his three Reverences to the Lord High Steward, delivered to Mr <hi>Fanshaw,</hi> he reads the Indorsement. A fifth <hi>O Yes</hi> to call the Lords, sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by the Command of my Lord High Steward, to answer to their Names, which accordingly they did, beginning as at the first, as every one was named putting of their Hats, standing up until the next was named. A sixth <hi>O Yes</hi> to the Lievtenant of the Tower to return his Precept, and bring his Prisoner to the Bar, which he did, and gave his Precept to the Serjeant, who gave it to Mr <hi>Fanshaw,</hi> and he as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore read the Indorsement. The Prisoner made three Reverences to his Grace and the Peers, being attired in black Tammel, a <hi>Cyprus Caperoon,</hi> a Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>web Lawn Ruff and Cuffs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord Steward.</hi> My Lords, the Reason why you are called hither this day, is to sit as Peers of <hi>Frances</hi> Countess of <hi>Somerset.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fanshaw</hi> Clerk of the Crown. <hi>Frances</hi> Countess of <hi>Somerset,</hi> hold up thy hand; she does so hold it up, till Mr Lievtenant told her she might hold it down; and then reads the Indictment, containing <hi>Westons</hi> Actions, in the poysoning of Sir <hi>Tho. Overbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and her Abetting him the 8 of <hi>May,</hi> 1613.</p>
               <p>All the while the Indictment was reading, the Countess of <hi>Somerset</hi> stood looking pale, troubled, and shed some few tears, and at the first naming of <hi>Weston</hi> in the Indictment, she put her Fan before her face, and there held it half covered, till the <hi>Indictment</hi> was read.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fanshaw
<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Frances,</hi> Countess of <hi>Somerset,</hi> what sayst thou? art thou guilty of this Felony and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or not guilty?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:52051:45"/>She making an obeysance to the Lord High <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> answered, <hi>Guilty,</hi> and with a low voyce, but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful fearful.</p>
               <p>My Lady upon the Arraignment having pleaded Guilty, the Proceedings after was thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Attourney.</hi> May it please your Grace, my Lord High Steward of <hi>England,</hi> I am glad to hear the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies so free Acknowledgment, for Confession is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Those that have been formerly indicted at their Arraignments persisted in denyal, as <hi>Weston, Turner, Francklin, Elvish</hi>; but you see this Ladies Humility and Repentance by her pleading, and certainly she cannot be but a spectacle of much Commiseration, if either you respect the Sex, a woman, or her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, Honorable.</p>
               <p>But this and to morrow day is to crown Justice; the Mercy seat is the inward part of the Temple, the Throne publique; and therefore I do now only pray a Record of the Confession and Judgment; but since the Peers be met together, for Honours sake it is good to declare the Kings Justice.</p>
               <p>This is the second time since the Kings coming these thirteen years, that any Peers have been ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, and both these times your <hi>Grace</hi> hath had the place of <hi>High Steward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first was <hi>Gray</hi> and <hi>Cobham,</hi> and though they were convicted, yet Execution followed not; No Noble blood hath been spilt since His Majesties Raign.</p>
               <p>The first was Revenge of Treason against Male-contents, and this of the particular offence to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Subject against those that have been so high in the Kings grace and favour, and therefore deserves to be written in a Sun-beam; but his being the best Master in the World, hinders him not from being the best King; for he can as well plain a Hill, as
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52051:46"/>
raise a wall; a good Lesson to put to my Lords, the Peers: He is Lievtenant to him that is no Respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of persons.</p>
               <p>This that I shall now speak of, may be reduced to that which was acted in the Vault, and since upon the Stage. The first I will not now enter into, because I will neither grieve a Lady that is present, nor touch a Lord that is absent, my duty requires it not, and my Humility forbids it. That which hath been upon the Stage, the Theater of Gods Iustice; you shall understand that which hath been worthily act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King in this whole Work of Iustice, and right well by his Ministers. <hi>Overbury</hi> dyed poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the 15 of <hi>September,</hi> 1613. in the Tower of <hi>London</hi>; He was no sooner dead, but there was a certain Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and Muttering, that <hi>Vox Populi,</hi> that <hi>Overbury</hi> came strangely by his death; and at that time on the contrary there was another Rumour, but that was <hi>Vox Diaboli,</hi> that he dyed of a foul disease, so foul a one, as is unfit for me to name; but for two years after this, though <hi>Overburies</hi> blood cryed for vengeance, <hi>Vox Dei</hi> was not heard: <hi>Gloria Dei C<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lare Regis perscrutare rem</hi>; It is the Glory of God to conceal a thing, of a King to find it out; yet all the while God so dazled the eyes of these two great Procurers and their Instruments, that the first looked not about them, the other fled not.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of the first Progress it first broke forth; and as all Murthers are strange in their discovery, so this was miraculous, for it came out in a <hi>Complement,</hi> thus: My Lord of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> who is now with God, commended Sir <hi>Gervise El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis</hi> to a Councellor of State, and told him that Sir <hi>Gervise,</hi> in respect of good report he had heard made of his Honour and Worth, desired to be made
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52051:46"/>
known unto him; That Councellor added, that he took it for a favour from him, but withall added, there lies a kind of heavy Imputation on him about <hi>Overburies</hi> Death, I could wish he could clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or give some satisfaction in the point: This my Lord related back, and presently <hi>Elvis</hi> was struck with it, and made a kind of discovery, that some at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts were undertaken against <hi>Overbury,</hi> but took no effect as checkt by him.</p>
               <p>This Councellor weighing well the Narration from <hi>Elvis,</hi> acquainted the King with the <hi>Overture,</hi> who commanded presently that <hi>Elvis</hi> should set down his knowledg in writing, which accordingly he did, but always reserving himself, still endeavoring ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to discover others, then any else should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that Office, and so accuse him.</p>
               <p>The King still endeavors to search the truth of this business, gives Direction for the Examination of the Truth of it, commits it to certain Councellors; they pick something out of him and <hi>Weston</hi>; then the further Enquiry is delivered over to my Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> who in this Cause was very painful, took two and three hundred Examinations; but when he found it might touch upon greater persons, then he desired some others might be joyned with him, which was accordingly granted, namely, the Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> Lord <hi>Steward,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Zouch</hi>; but then there were no practices left untryed for the suppressing of the Discovery: <hi>Weston</hi> was so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to stand mute, but at last this dumb Devil was cast out, then followed <hi>Elvis, Turner, Francklin</hi>; all which were Actors in this Tragedy without Malice, but no Authors. Now when this Lady comes to her part, she meets Justice in the way by Confession, which is either the Corner stone of Mercy or Judgment; yet it is said,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52051:47"/>
                  <hi>Mercy and Truth are met together</hi>: Truth you have in her Confession, and that may be a degree to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; with me it must be, and to him in whose Power it resides, in the mean time this day must be reserved for Judgment.</p>
               <p>Now to conclude, and give you Accompt of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Procrastinations in this business; the first was due to Humanity, her Child-birth, the second was for reason of state, and the last had a grave and weighty Cause.</p>
               <p>These Directions the King at first gave, written with his own Hand for the Examination of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, I desire may be read.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>The Kings Instructions.</head>
               <p>THere be two contrary things in this Cause to be tryed, and the verity can be but in one of them. First, whether my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi> and my Lady were the Procurers of <hi>Overbury</hi>'s death, or that this Imputation hath by some practice cast an aspersion upon them; I would have you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently inquire of the first, and if you find him clear, then I would have you as carefully look after the other, to the intent such practices may be discovered, and not suffered to pass without punishing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Attourney.</hi> There be other Directions in these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions by way of Interrogatories, that are not now necessary to be read; let the <hi>Lords,</hi> the Peers, view these Directions from the King.</p>
               <p>None of these Interrogatories, which the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired there should be examination upon, came away empty; and whatsoever whispering there be abroad of the death of <hi>Weston,</hi> they all before the hour of their death confessed the fact, and dyed penitent; and if need should require, I have brought their

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Attourney.</hi> May it please your Grace, whereas <hi>Frances</hi> Countess of <hi>Somerset,</hi> as accessary before the fact of the wilful poysoning and murther of Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury,</hi> upon her Indictment she hath been Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, then upon her Arraignment she hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Guilty, I desire that her Confession may be recorded, and Judgment upon the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fanshaw. Frances</hi> Countess of <hi>Somerset,</hi> thou hast been Indicted, Arraigned, and pleaded Guilty, as accessary before the Fact of the wilful poysoning and Murther of Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury</hi>; what canst thou say for thy self, why Judgment of death should not be pronounced against thee?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Countess.</hi> I can much aggravate, but nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate my fault; I desire Mercy, and that the Lords would be pleased to intreat for me to the King: This she spake humbly, fearfully, and so low, that the Lord Steward could not hear it, but the Attourney rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Attourney.</hi> The Lady is so touched with remorse and sense of her fault, that grief surprizes her from expressing of her self, but that which she hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly said is to this effect, That she cannot excuse her self, but desires mercy.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>R. Connisby</hi> sitting before the Lord High Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard

               <p>
                  <hi>Lord Steward. Frances</hi> Countess of <hi>Somerset,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou hast been indicted, Arraigned, and pleaded Guilty, and confessed that thou hast nothing to say for thy self, it is now my part to pronounce Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, only thus much before; since my Lords have
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52051:48"/>
heard with what Humility and grief you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the Fact, I do not doubt but they will signifie so much to the Kings Majesty, and mediate for his Grace towards you, but in the mean time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law, the sentence of death must be thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou must go to the Tower of</hi> London <hi>from hence, and from thence to the place of Execution, where you are to be hanged by the Neck till you be dead,</hi> and <hi>Lord have Mercy upon your Soul.</hi>

            <p>ANd first, what was done before the Pleading. <hi>Sergt. Cryer. O Yes,</hi> My Lord High Steward of <hi>England</hi> purposes to proceed this day to the Arraignment of <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Somerset.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Yes,</hi> Whosoever have any Indictments touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Cause, presently give them in
<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Cook</hi> delivers the Indictment of my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi> to Mr <hi>Fanshaw</hi> endorsed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walter Les</hi> Sergeant at Arms, return the <hi>Precipe,</hi> for the Lords which thou hast warned to be here this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Yes,</hi> He calls every Lord by his name, and they stand up as they be called.</p>
            <p>The Lord Steward excuses the Lord <hi>Mountegle</hi> and <hi>Russel</hi> of their absence in respect of their sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fanshaw. Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Somerset,</hi> hold up thy hand; He held it up so long, till Mr Lievtenant bid him hold it down. The Indictment is read, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>VVestons</hi> Actions in the poysoning of Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury,</hi> and his abetting of him the 8. of <hi>May,</hi> 1613.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:52051:49"/>The Lord <hi>Somerset</hi> was apparelled in a plain Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Sute, laced with two Sattin laces in a seam, a Gown of uncut Velvit, all the sleeves laid with a Sattin lace, a pair of Gloves with Sattin tops, his George about his Neck, his Hair curl'd, his Visage pale, his Beard long, his Eyes sank in his Head, whilest his Indictment was reading he three or four times whispered to the Lievtenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fanshaw. Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Somerset,</hi> what saist thou? art thou guilty of this Felony and Murder whereof thou standest indicted, or not?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Somerset</hi> making obeysance to the Lord Steward, answered, Not guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fanshaw.</hi> How wilt thou be tryed?</p>
            <p>By God and the Country; but presently recalling himself, said, By God and my Peers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Yes,</hi> all you that be to give in Evidence against <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Somerset,</hi> who stands now at the Bar upon his deliverance, make your appearance, and you shall be heard what you have to say against him.</p>
            <p>My Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi> upon his Arraignment having pleaded not guilty, the Proceeding after was thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Somerset,</hi> you have been Arraigned, and pleaded not guilty, now whatsoever you have to say in defence of your self, say it boldly without fear; and though it be not the ordinary custom, you shall have Pen and Ink to help your memory; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that God is the God of Truth; a fault de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended is a double Crime; Hide not the verity, nor affirm not an untruth, for to deny that which is true increaseth the offence; Take heed left your wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness cause the Gates of Mercy to be shut upon you.</p>
            <p>Now for you my Lords the Peers, you are to give diligent attention to that which shall be said, and you must not rest alone upon one peece of Evidence,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52051:49"/>
but ground your Judgment upon the whole.</p>
            <p>This moreover I would have you remember, that though you be not sworn as common Juries upon a Book, yet you are fled in as great a Bond, your own Honors and Fidelity, and your Allegiance to the King, and thus I leave the whole Proceedings to your Censure; and for you that be of the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, free your discourse from all partiality, and let Truth prevail, and endeavor to make it appear.</p>
            <p>Sergeant <hi>Mountague.</hi> My Lord High Steward, and you my Lords, I know this cannot be but a heavy spectacle unto you, to see that man that not long since in a great place with a white Staff went before the King, should now at this Bar hold up his hand for blood: But this is the change of Fortune, nay I might better say the Hand of God, and Work of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, which is the Kings Honor. But now to the Fact.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Somerset</hi> stands indicted as accessary before the Fact of the wilful Murther and poysoning of Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury,</hi> done by <hi>Weston,</hi> but procured by him.</p>
            <p>This, my Lords, is your Charge; the Indictment hath been found by men of good quality, or Knights and Esquires of the best rank and reputation, some of whose names I will be bold to read unto you, Sir <hi>Thomas Fowler,</hi> Sir <hi>Will. Slingsby,</hi> and five more, these have returned <hi>Billae Vera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>VVeston</hi> at four several times gave <hi>Overbury</hi> four several Poysons, the first <hi>May</hi> 9. 1613. that <hi>Rosaker,</hi> carrying this Poyson in one hand, and the Broth in the other hand; the second was in <hi>Iune</hi> following, and that was <hi>Arsnick;</hi> the third was in <hi>Iuly</hi> 10, then following, and that was <hi>Mercury Sublimate</hi>; the fourth was on the 14 of <hi>September,</hi> and that was <hi>Mercury Sublimate</hi> in a Glister, given by <hi>VVeston,</hi> and an
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52051:50"/>
Apothecary yet unknown, and that killed him.</p>
            <p>Of these four several Poysons, ministred by <hi>Weston,</hi> and procured by him the 15. of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1613. <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> dyed, and the Author is ever worse then the Act.</p>
            <p>The first Poyson laid in the Indictment that <hi>Weston</hi> gave Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury,</hi> was the 9. of <hi>May,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we say, the Lord of <hi>Somerset May</hi> 8. hired, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled and abetted <hi>Weston</hi> to that Fact: And as this (my Lord) I do charge you for a King; so King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was charged in the like case for the murther of <hi>Uriah</hi>; and though <hi>David</hi> was under his Pavilion, and <hi>Uriah</hi> in the Army, yet <hi>David</hi> was the cause of his murther: So you were in the Kings Chamber, and <hi>Overbury</hi> in the Tower, yet you were the Cause, and it is you that killed him. It was a stronger hand then <hi>Westons</hi> that wrought this; the proof Mr At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney will follow: And now will I conclude with desires to the Peers, that they will not expect visible Proofs in a work of darkness.</p>
            <p>The second, That whereas in an Indictment there may be things laid only for form, you are not to look that the Proof should follow that, but only that which is substantial; and the substance only must be this, Whether my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi> procured or caused the poysoning of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> or not?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord Steward.</hi> That indeed, my Lord, is that which you are to look after, whether my Lord <hi>Somerset</hi> was the Cause of his poysoning, or not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cook.</hi> This was well moved by Mr Recorder, and the Law is clear in this point, that the proof must follow the substance, not the form.</p>
            <p>The Judges all rising, affirmed this to be true.</p>
            <p>This, my Lord, is certain, the Law gives form in Indictments, but only substance in Proofs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:52051:50"/>I know, my Lord High Steward, and you the Lords the Peers, that you cannot behold this Lord at the Bar without the remembrance of his former great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yet a Peer amongst you, and therefore I know you will be very tender in the cutting of him off from your number without good Evidence; We, my Lords, that be to speak against him, have received an admonition from the King, to use no Invectives, but give in pertinent Evidence; I think we should have done so howsoever, but yet we cannot but be glad of so good a Warrant; we will therefore carry the Proof upright against all Evasion, the Evidence will bear it self. That which I am now to speak, I will divide into four Parts.</p>
            <p>The first shall be of the greatness of the Crime, not to weigh or press you down (my Lord) but to shew that the King was bound by his Oath to bring this Cause to Judgment, though you had been the Signet of his right Hand.</p>
            <p>The second shall be, what Proof I hold to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent in this Case.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I will state and sum up the Proof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>And fourthly, I will produce Oaths or Writings confessed.</p>
            <p>First, Of all kind of Felonies this is the greatest, and that I will urge thus: First, It is Murther, the first Record we ever read of in the Bible was a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon Murther; and though <hi>Cain</hi> was not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with death in respect of the <hi>Primogenite,</hi> or some other secret Causes, which God reserved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, yet he was sentenced. Although <hi>Ioabs</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for the Murther of <hi>Abner</hi> was respited, yet it was not forgotten, no Sanctuary could relieve him, he was taken from the Horns of the Altar. In the second Table the first forbidding Commandment is, <hi>Thou shalt not Murther.</hi> And some other most
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52051:51"/>
learned Rabbins that referred that Commandment where the Obedience of Parents is expressed to the first Table; so then this is the first of the second.</p>
            <p>My second Aggravation is, that this Murther is by Poyson; Poyson is a forraign practice, fit for <hi>Rome</hi> and her Doctrine; It hath these three Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</p>
            <p>First, It is fierce, it takes a man suddenly in Gods Peace and the Kings, when he thinks least of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is easily done, and once conceived hardly prevented or discovered: Princes have their Guards about them to withstand any force or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and Gentlemen their Servants, for that never comes but with a noise; whereas on the contrary, there are a number of Poysons, that they will neither distaste nor discolour that they be put into.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It takes not only away the party maliced or meant; it is like an Arrow shot that hath no aym; and if Facts of this kind were not met withall by condign punishment, what society would there be amongst men?</p>
            <p>In the 22. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. a Poysoner ayming at one man, poysoned a dish of Barm, at this time there was a feast at the Bishop of <hi>Rochesters,</hi> that Barm was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly used in Broths and boyled meats, sixteen at the Table were poysoned with it, nay it went as far as the Alms-basket, and some poor dyed of it.</p>
            <p>Well, this year Poysoning was esteemed so great an offence, that a Statute was made to make it High Treason.</p>
            <p>My third Aggravation is, That it was against the Kings Prisoner in the Tower, where the King and State were in a manner bound to answer for him; and, my Lords, till now there hath been no Murther in that place since the Nephews of King <hi>Richard</hi> the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52051:51"/>
third were there murthered by his Command.</p>
            <p>My second general Division is, What Proofs I hold to be compleat in this Case; I hope my Lords the Peers will consider, that of all Murthers Poysoning is the most secret: And therefore to look for Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies direct, is to say, that they proclaim impunity; who should have impeached <hi>Parasapis,</hi> who poysoned one side of a Knife, and eat with the other. But, my Lord, you are not to enquire of actual impoysoning, but the procuring and faciliating of it; and that is to be an Abettor before the Fact if any middle course should be used, to the intent such a matter might be effected, if afterwards it be done.</p>
            <p>For example; There be three intended to Rob a man, one sends a Letter to him upon some pretended business to draw him such a way, the other fearing he may carry some company with him, useth some means to divert him from that, and proffers to go with him himself, and holds him in discourse, until the third man comes upon him, and doth the fact; certainly all these are guilty.</p>
            <p>It is not he only that slips the Dog, but he that loves the Toyl, that kills the Deer. But these things, my Lord, are so perspicuous that I will not dilate.</p>
            <p>My third Division was the stating and summing up the Proofs, and that shall be thus:</p>
            <p>First, A plain Narrative of the Fact it self.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The distribution of it into parts, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of the Evidence.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, The Production of Witnesses and Writings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Somerset.</hi> I humbly desire to answer every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular as it is objected against me; my memory is short, and so I may omit to Answer some of the most principal Objections.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:52051:52"/>
               <hi>Lord Steward.</hi> The constant course of the Court must be kept; you cannot interrupt the Kings Councel; they must give their Evidence entire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you come to your Answer; you have now Pen and Ink to observe what they urge against you; and if after you omit any thing, when you come to your Answer, you shall have all the Helps that can be afforded you.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Attorney.</hi> My Lord of <hi>Somerset,</hi> in substance I will answer and satisfie your Request, for you shall have three Cogitations.</p>
            <p>First, Take your aym of that that shall be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against you in the Narrative; then a second in the distribution of it into parts; and lastly the third, when the Witnesses shall be produced, and more when you come to your Answer; if you omit any thing that hath been objected against you, I will put you in mind of it.</p>
            <p>Now for the Narrative, the Friendship and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity betwixt my Lord of <hi>Somerset,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was so great, if you beleeve him in his own Letter, but he was a <hi>Trasonical</hi> Fellow, that the Ballance had need be altered, that the greatest matters and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of State, which my Lord executed under the King were all communicated unto him, not whisperingly, or by peece meals, as sometimes Councellors use to do to their friends for a favor; but <hi>Overbury</hi> took Copies, Registers, and Extracts of all that passed; they had Ciphers between them, which went under the name of <hi>Iergins</hi> of the King and Queens name, and all the Councellors of State; and this kind of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterical writing is never used but by Princes, or their Embassadors; if by others, then by such as be Practisers against them; yet, my Lord, I charge you with no disloyalty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:52051:52"/>I remember a Speech Your Grace hath often said in <hi>Chancery,</hi> That Fraud, Frost and foul weather; I might adde without disloyalty, of Friendship of ill men; And so, my Lord, it proved on your part to Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned thus, You went about an Unlawful Love, designed by my Lord of <hi>Northampton,</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned by him under pretence of Friendship, though in truth that was not the occasion, but his Unwillingness to have any Partners in your Favour besides Himself: For He Himself writes in a Letter to you, That you won her by his Letters; but this impetuous unbounded Fellow, <hi>Overbury,</hi> first began with Threats, in respect of the communication of Secrets; Here upon this, there grew two streames of Hatred upon Him, one from You, and another from my Lady, but yours of a more nigher nature; for your self confessed, That he had such hold of you He might overthrow you. There was a third stream besides these, and that came from my Lord of <hi>Northampton</hi>; And from you three <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbury</hi> was concluded <hi>Filius Mortis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now how this should be executed, the means for that was now to be thought on; And for that there was but two Ways, Violence or Poyson.</p>
            <p>The first was attempted, but that failing, you fell upon the second, how should that be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? If he had been abroad, or at liberty, you know he had too jealous a Head to be easily entrapped; what then was to be done one way, but was to be cooped up? but how must that be done? There, my Lord, you plead a pefidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part by your Plot: OVERBURY was
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52051:53"/>
designed for an Honorable Employment beyond the Sea, and disswaded by you, animating him to refuse the Kings Command; upon this, for his contempt he is committed to the Tower; when he was there must he have the liberty of the Ayr? No; He must be committed close Prisoner, that you might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter compass your desires. There you had him fast, there was no avoyding of it, but death must be his bane.</p>
            <p>Now for the knitting up and connection of these things, If you had not a Lievtenant to your hand, and an Under-Keeper for your purpose, all was but in vain; and so you ordered it: for <hi>Overbury</hi> had not been five days in the Tower, but <hi>VVade</hi> was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, <hi>Elvis</hi> put in, <hi>Caris</hi> his old Keeper put out, and <hi>Weston</hi> his Poysoner put unto him. And though the placing of Sir <hi>Iervise Elvis</hi> was consulted in ten days before his Imprisonment, yet all was resolved and done within five days after.</p>
            <p>Now for the last Act of the Tragedy; When he was there, and close Prisoner, none of his Friends might come to him, neither Father, nor Kindred, nor his Servants, nor none but his Poysoner. Now <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> was sent for, he must buy Poysons, not such as would quickly kill him, but by degrees, to avoyd all suspicion. And then there was nothing came to him, Salt, Sauces, Tarts, Medicines, Glysters, that were not poysoned. All the Petitionary means that were either made by him or his Friends, for his Liberty, were stopped, though entertained by you my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi>; You used him as Fortune-Tellers do poor people in the Country, hold them in a Tale while they steal away their purse. Now my Lord of <hi>Somerset,</hi> for the distributing of it into parts, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the evidence to make you guilty, we will
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52051:53"/>
Prove it by matter precedent, present, and subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
            <p>First, There was a mortal hatred on your part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, You used the means to expose him to the Tower, and there to keep him close Prisoner. After these two I will follow the Proofs my self.</p>
            <p>Now for matter present, That your hand was in poysoning <hi>Overbury,</hi> directed, delivered Poysons, thirsted after the news; The prosecution of this I leave to speak of. After his death you took the course that every guilty man would do in such a case, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing Testimony, Letters, and going about to get a pardon.</p>
            <p>Now for a hate of Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury,</hi> together with a fear of his revealing of secrets; You made a vow that he should neither live in Court or Country, that if he came out of the Tower one of you two must dye. Now of <hi>Overburies</hi> part he writes to you, That if he dye, your shame shall never dye; prays God you repent not the neglect of him in that place from whence he writes to you. Now by way of exclusion you cannot alledg, That this your hatred to him, and plotting his Commitment, was in respect to your Wife; why then did you not suffer him to go beyond Sea? No, the bargain was made, the poysons were ready; there were some secrets, together with your malice towards him, was so great, that there was no safe course for you, in your opinion, but this death.</p>
            <p>And for the producing of my proofs I will use this course; Those Examinations that have been taken upon Oath shall be here read, the witnesses also I have caused to be here, that they may be sworn, and to justifie or deny what they hear read; and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish or add to their Examinations: And beside,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52051:54"/>
that you my Lord of <hi>Somerset,</hi> and you my Lords the Peers, may ask them what further questions you please.</p>

               <hi>Tho. Payton,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his Servant: He saw a Letter of his Masters, whose hand he knew to be my Lord of <hi>Somersets,</hi> wherein were these words, <hi>If I dye, my blood lie upon you.</hi> And in that or another Letter there was this clause, <hi>You are now as good as your word, you have kept your vow to me</hi>; Moreover, that in the privy gallery in <hi>Whitehall</hi> my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi> coming late to his Chamber met there with Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury</hi>; How now, says my Lord, are you up yet? Nay, answered Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> what makes you here at this time of the night? Will you never leave the company of the base Woman? and seeing you do so neglect mine advise, I desire that to morrow morning we may part, and that you will let me have that portion you know is due to me; And then I will leave you free to your self, to stand upon your own legs.</p>
            <p>My Lord answered, His legs were strong enough to bear himself, and so departed in great displeasure, and to his knowledg they were never perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled again: And being asked how he heard this discourse, He said, it was in the dead of the night; and he being in a room within the Gallery, heard all that passed.</p>

               <p>I acknowledge every part of this Examination to be true, and more, That my Master being in the Tower, he sent a Letter by <hi>Weston</hi> to me to carry to my Lord; and more, to deliver my Lord this message, That the powder he had sent him made him very sick, and gave him in one night sixty stools, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side

vomits. This Letter I carryed to the Court, and delivered to Mr <hi>Rawlin</hi> to carry in to my Lord, who was then in his Chamber. My Lord presently came out and asked me how my Master did, I told him, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sick; and withall this message, and how the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick had wrought with him; My Lord smiled, and said, Pish, and so turned him away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lawrence Davis,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Overburies</hi> Servant, Saith, That he hath heard his Master say, that he would have gone Embassador, but that my Lord of <hi>Rochester</hi> disswaded him; He hath seen some Letters of Sir <hi>Thomas Overburies,</hi> wherein he wrote, My Lord of <hi>Rochester</hi> was even with him; but he thinks he never saw those passages.</p>

                  <p>Is this the fruit of my care and love to you? Be these the fruits of common secrets, common dangers? As a man you cannot suffer me to lie in this misery, yet your behavior betrays you: All that I entreat of you is, that you would free me from this place, and that we part friends: Drive me not into extremities, lest I say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that you and I may both repent: and I pray God you repent not the emission of this my counsel in this place from whence I now write this Letter.</p>

               <p>It is true that those letters were lost, but after found by him who knew his Master Sir <hi>Tho. Overburies</hi> hand.</p>

               <p>They were found in a Cabinet amongst some other things left in Trust by my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi> with Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> who fearing searches delivers them to a Friend of his in <hi>Holborn,</hi> one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss <hi>Farnforth</hi>; she, to the intent they might be safely kept, sent them to a Merchants House in <hi>Cheapside,</hi> where some seven Moneths before she had lodged, and desires they might be safely kept for her, pretending they were some Writings which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern her <hi>Ioyature.</hi> On Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> day she her self comes to have them again, saying, she must carry them to her Councel to peruse: <hi>If you will, suffer me to open it before you</hi> (says the Merchant,) <hi>and that there be nothing else, you shall have them.</hi> But she by no means would consent to the breaking of it open: Then he answered, It is a troublesom time, I will go to the <hi>Lord Chief Iustice,</hi> and if he finde no other Writings but such as concern you, you shal have them again. So coming to my Chamber, and not finding me within, (for I was gone to <hi>Pauls</hi> to the Sermon) He went to my Lord <hi>Zouch,</hi> one of the appointed Commissioners for this Cause, who he himself would not break it open, but came to <hi>Pauls</hi> to me, and in a by-room brake it open, and found in it many Letters, which were disadvantagious to my Lord of <hi>Somerset.</hi>

            <p>These matters being made evident, need no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be amplified; For my Lord, As it is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in Nature, <hi>That the best things are in their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption the worst</hi>; And <hi>the sweetest wine makes the sharpest Vineger</hi>; So fell it out with my Lord of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52051:55"/>
               <hi>Somerset</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> that this access (as I may call it) of Friendship ended in mortal hatred on my Lord of <hi>Somersets</hi> part.</p>
            <p>The Indictment being found, my Lord High Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, confirmed with the Opinion of the other Judges, did pronounce the <hi>Sentence of Death</hi> upon my Lord of <hi>Somerset,</hi> and so the Court dissolved.</p>
