            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSAL. 65. 5.</bibl>
               <q>By terrible things in righteouſneſſe wilt thou anſwer us, oh God of our ſalvation: who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are a farre off upon the ſea.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Pſalme is <hi>Euchariſticall.</hi> It is a forme of thankeſgiving penned by <hi>David</hi> for thoſe mercies, which God beſtowes on mankind. The firſt verſe calls on the Church of God to <note place="margin">Verſ. 1.</note> praiſe him, for the things afterward recited. Others will take no notice of them; or if they doe, yet they will not ſo freely acknowledge Gods kindneſſe in them: and therfore the Saints, the children of Zion muſt doe it. The reſt of the Pſalme is ſpent in recounting the benefits, both ſpirituall and temporall which are conferred. The ſpirituall bleſſings which properly belong to the Church and faithfull people of God are foure. 1. Gods hearing of their prayers. In the want of defence, counſell, reliefe: in the midſt of afflictions and troubles, when they are ſtraitned, and upon the verge of any extremitie, he heareth their prayers: <hi>Oh thou that heareſt prayers to thee ſhall all fleſh come.</hi> 2. Remiſſion of ſinnes <note place="margin">Verſ. 2.</note> is another bleſſing here recounted: though ſinne hath raiſed the ſtorme of afflictions, trouble, and adverſaries; yet God will purge away ſinne: and the cauſe of theſe ſtormes removed, there is a calme. <hi>As for our tranſgreſſions thou ſhalt purg them</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 3.</note>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:50293:4"/>
               <hi>away.</hi> 3. The collection of a Church is another bleſſing here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed. And 4. The ſaving and preſerving this Church in a <note place="margin">Verſ. 4.</note> wonderfull and admirable manner, ſo as others ſhall be driven to joyne themſelves to the Church: this is another favour from God. And theſe are the bleſſings ſpirituall which this Pſalme doth mention. The bleſſings temporall are common to the Saints with others: yet they are ſuch, that none but Saints will take <note place="margin">Verſ. 5.</note> notice to praiſe God for them: and therefore for theſe alſo, <hi>Praiſe waiteth for God in Zion.</hi> Theſe bleſſings temporall are. 1. The erection of Kingdomes, and Governments in the world. It is from the mighty power of God, that Common wealths are ſet on their foundation. <hi>He by his ſtrength ſet fast the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 6.</note> By <hi>mountaines,</hi> Common wealths are here to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as they are in the latter part of the firſt verſe of the ſecond of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> It would be a terrible ſight to ſee mountaines tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and rowling, ready to cloſe and breake one another in pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and yet ſuch are all the Common wealths in the world, they would totter and tumble and deſtroy one another, but that God hath faſtened them: their bounds are ſet; and that is one bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. 2. The repreſſion of tumults, ſeditions, and conſpiracies in Kingdomes, which would utterly ruine them; is another bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <note place="margin">Verſe 7.</note> which God grants, and for which he is to be praiſed. And this is amplified by the terror ſeiſing on the wicked and profane, when they ſhall ſee the power of God, curbing and cruſhing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious men: when theſe are croſt and cruſht, then ſhall all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in all places, beleive, and feare and tremble. <hi>The utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most parts of the earth ſhall be afraid of thy tokens</hi> that is of thy judgements executed upon the rebellious, and upon the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <note place="margin">Verſe 8.</note> of people. 3. The reſtitution of peace and plenty to a people in a firmer and more eſtabliſhed manner then they had before, is another bleſſing. <hi>Thou makeſt the out-goings of the morning, and evening to rejoyce.</hi> Men ſhall in the morning goe out to their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with joy and in ſecuritie; and at evening they ſhall have ſongs of joy and reioycing in the night: they ſhall have no more terror by night, nor feare and trembling in the day, as in the time of former troubles, by the tumults of ſuch who ſought to diſſolve their Kingdomes and Common wealths: God will fill them full of peace and comfort, and make <hi>the Out-goings of the morning
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50293:4"/>
and evening to rejoyce.</hi> And then he will abundantly bleſte with plenty, ſo as neither the Church, nor the world ſhall complaine of ſearcitie; when God hath wrought theſe great things for his people: as the reſt of the Pſalme ſets out. This is the ſumme and <note place="margin">From verſ. 9. to the end.</note> ſcope of the whole Pſalme: being a Pſalme of Thankeſgiving for mercies, vouchſafed the Church both in ſpiritualls and in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls.</p>

                  </gap>.</note> good light to underſtand that the things whereby God delivers his people are terrible. 1. In reſpect of the terror, which they worke in the adverſaries of his people. 2. In reſpect of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and amazement which they procure both in the adverſaries and in others. And 3. Terrible in reſpect of the reverence and awfull regard which they worke or ſhould worke in all ſorts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. Of theſe in order.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God delivers by things which ſtrikes terror and feare into adverſaries: and theſe things may be reduced to ſeven heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God ſometimes preſerves his people by terrible imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wrought in their adverſaries: ſo he delivered <hi>Iſrael</hi> by filling all <hi>Aegypt</hi> with feare and terror. <hi>Aegypt was glad when they departed for the feare of them fell on them.</hi> And ſo <hi>Iſrael</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal 105. 38.</note> was ſaved from the <hi>Midianites,</hi> the Lord put feare into the heart of their Army, when <hi>Gideon</hi> and his Souldiers blew the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets. <note place="margin">Iudg. 7. 20, 21.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. God ſometimes cauſeth the adverſaries of his people to heare of ſome terrible, yet true and reall relation, what he hath already done for his: and that weakens them. <hi>Your terror</hi> (ſaith <hi>Rahab</hi> to the Spics) <hi>hath fallen on us, and all the inhabitants</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioſh. 1. 9, 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>faint becauſe of you; for we have heard how the Lord dryed up the waters of the red ſea for you, when you came out of Aegypt, &amp;c. And as ſoone as we heard theſe things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remaine any more courage in any becauſe of you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. God ſometimes ſtrikes terror into the adverſaries, by ſome terrible machinations, which they heare is attempted againſt them: and by this meanes he ſometimes ſaves and preſerves his people. Thus when <hi>Philiſtines</hi> are againſt <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> it is terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, becauſe they cannot invade <hi>Iſrael.</hi> When the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines</hi> invaded the land, it was terrible to <hi>Saul,</hi> to be thereby tooke off from purſuing <hi>David.</hi> The Lord filled the heart of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>

            <p n="4">4. God oft delivers and preſerves his Church, and people, by ſtriking terror into their adverſaries, through terrible fruſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

or diſappointments in all the adverſaries agents and meanes, making them ineffectuall. <hi>Pharoh</hi> was hot in the purſuit of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> but the chariots wheeles were tooke off, and that was terrible <note place="margin">Exod 24. 25.</note> to the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> When God ſhall drowne a Navie, an Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, coming with full ſayle to deſtroy: when he weakens at any time the ſtrength, and infatuates Counſellers, and makes adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to fall on wayes, and counſells deſtructive to themſelves: theſe are things very terrible to them, and yet meanes of the Churches deliverance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. God ſometimes raiſeth up terrible oppoſitions againſt the adverſaries, and that terrifies them, and ſtops their rage and fury from working bitterly againſt the Church: and the Church ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hath deliverance. Thus God called for an Angell, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed <hi>Senacharibs</hi> Army. He called for a wind and ſplit and <note place="margin">2 King. 19. 35. Pſal. 48. 7, 8.</note> ſunke the ſhips of <hi>Tarſhiſh.</hi> He called to lice, to frogs, to flyes, to haile, to locuſts, to his ſore and terrible judgements, and they devoured <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The leaſt creature when God armes it againſt an adverſary is very terrible: and by ſuch terrible things many times God ſtrikes feare and terror into the adverſaries, and workes ſafetie for his people.</p>
            <p n="6">6. God ſometimes preſerves his Church and people by terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble revelations: when he diſcovers the cloſeſt plots and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies and counſells of their adverſaries, when they carry on things ſubtilly, hoping that nothing ſhall be knowne: but <hi>a bird</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10. 20.</note> 
               <hi>of the ayre tells it;</hi> a letter reveales it: one thing or other brings all to light; and all mouthes are filled with talking of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible attempts. The plot of <hi>Haman</hi> for deſtroying all the <hi>Jewes.</hi> The plot of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> for maſſacring all the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The plot of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> for rooting out all <hi>Protestants</hi> in all Kingdomes. Theſe and many ſuch being diſcovered, are terrible to the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: and yet by ſuch terrible revelations God doth often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his people.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And ſo he doth ſometimes by terrible deſtructions: when either God deſtroyes the adverſary; or ſhewes his judgements on them, in ſome horrible manner, ſo as they ſhall never be able to lift up the heele, and kicke and ſpurne his people. When the <note place="margin">Zach. 1. 21.</note> Lord pleaſes to knock off all the hornes that puſhed, it will bee very terrible: and yet thus he often times ſaves his Church.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50293:6"/>
               <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is drowned; <hi>Haman</hi> is hanged; and his people eſcape.</p>
            <p>Thus the things by which God delivers his people are terrible, in reſpect of the terror which thereby befalls the adverſaries.</p>
            <p>Secondly; The things by which God preſerves his Church are terrible in reſpect of the wonder and amazement, which they produce both in the adverſaries, and in Gods people: filling them both full of aſtoniſhment and amazement when they are ſeriouſly conſidered. For;</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is wonderfull that the Lord oft ſaveth his people by weak meanes, <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the things which are mighty.</hi> It was a thing wonderfull, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 7.</note> that <hi>Siſera</hi> ſhould be ſold into the hands of a woman: That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance ſhould come by <hi>Esther:</hi> That <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſhould ſlay a thouſand with the jaw-bone of an Aſſe: That a few Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould yet remaine there, notwithſtanding the whole Kingdome be full of Popiſh Rebells. It is wonderfull that true Chriſtianitie, and the true reformed Religion, ſhould get ground and winne upon the world, daily increaſing and ſpreading, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all oppoſition which it hath had from the beginning. Though Emperours, Kings, Princes, Nobles, great ones, and men of all ſorts have combined againſt the puritie of Religion; yet that it ſhould prevaile, and finde multitudes of Profeſſours in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, this is wonderfull. It is very marveilous in our eyes, that the ſtone which the builders refuſed, ſhould become the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone in the building: and ſo it is that Antichriſt ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed daily by the breath of the Lords mouth: that by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word the Man of Sinne ſhould be at length fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. That a few Rammes-hornes ſhould breake downe the walls of <hi>Ierico.</hi> Theſe and a thouſand ſuch are wonderfull things: terrible in reſpect of the amazement, into which they may put all ſorts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is terrible, that is, a thing wonderfull, cauſing aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that God ſhould ſave and deliver his Church under the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likelihood of meanes: when all meanes &amp; inſtruments of its helpe ſeeme to bee inſufficient. <hi>Moſes</hi> a weak man is ſent to deliver <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and when he was ſent their burdens were greatned: and yet <hi>Iſraell</hi> was then upon the point of deliverance. God many times is working deliverance for his people when the meanes of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50293:6"/>
it is croſt, ſeemes to bee fruſtrated, diſappointed, to worke back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and altogether unlikely: and this is to the amazement of the adverſaries, and to the wonder of his owne people. It was a terrible, that is a thing wonderfull; that when all the European world was in a manner, filled in all places with agents for <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; Luther</hi> ſhould ariſe, and carry on the cauſe of the Goſpell againſt <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Pope, Charles</hi> the Emperour, againſt <hi>Cajetan</hi> the Cardinall: againſt <hi>Rome, Italy, Europe,</hi> the world, and Hell. This was a terrible aſtoniſhment to the <hi>Pontificians,</hi> and a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full though comfortable amazement to Gods owne people, who had long groaned for a Reformation. And ſo when <hi>Germany</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Camiltons</hi> diſcovery.</note> mourned under the pride and oppreſſion of the Emperour, and houſe of <hi>Auſtria:</hi> and when the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> (the <hi>Popes</hi> factours) had deviſed and contrived its utter ruine; yet then God raiſed up the <note place="margin">Guſtavus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus.</note> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who landed in <hi>Germany,</hi> but with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men at moſt; and God made him an inſtrument to curbe the Imperialiſts; this was a terrible thing the amaſement of the world. The Papiſts bragged, let us beat the <hi>Sweede,</hi> and then all <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> is ours, but God made the <hi>Sweede</hi> a rod to whip, and laſh <note place="margin">
                  <hi>So</hi> Til'y <hi>vido</hi> Swede Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeucer.</note> the Pontifician Nation in thoſe parts unto this day: this is ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to them that they gnaw their tongues for vexation of ſpirit. And ſo likewiſe who would have thought, that the troubles in <note place="margin">Revel. 16. 10</note> the <hi>North,</hi> ſhould have procured a pacification betweene the two Nations of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and give a light to the whole Iſland to looke to its ſecurity. And who would thinke, that. God is at this time bringing about the peace and ſecurity of <hi>England,</hi> though all the Agents, and inſtruments of it, ſhould be ſlighted, contemned, and deſpiſed: but God is he who work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wonders, effecting by unlikely meanes the Salvation of his Church; and when this cometh to paſſe, it will be a terrible aſtoniſhment to all the enemies of the Land, and a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full comfort to all Saints.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a thing terrible, that is wonderfull, cauſing aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, when God preſerves his people without meanes, in a miraculous way and manner: this ſtrikes terror into the adverſaries, and wonder into his people. When the ſea was made a paſſage for Iſarell, and therin the Aegyptians troubled, they were afraid: when <hi>Jordane</hi> was dryed up for the people
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50293:7"/>
to paſſe over, the hearts of the <hi>Cananites</hi> melted in them. It was terrible when God rained downe ſtones on the Kings which <note place="margin">Ioſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a 10.</note> fought againſt his people: terrible, when he ſuddenly cut off ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the perſecuting Emperors; &amp; gave therby his Church reſt, and a breathing time from trouble. And ſo when the Lord ſhall have effected miraculouſly (I beleeve he is now working it, though moſt think otherwiſe) the peace and ſecurity of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> though all the prime wits of Chriſtendome (among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtians) have beene imployed to undoe it: I ſay when it ſhall be ſeen that all their labours are miraculouſly quaſht: and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> feares are ſuddenly huſht; and that <hi>Englands</hi> Troublers ſhall but trouble, and undoe themſelues, in their attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, and that their now warring againſt her peace, doth but lay ground worke for the utter ruining of the Papacy in all <hi>Europe:</hi> when the Lord (I ſay) ſhall miraculouſly effect all this, then ſhall the enemies be aſhamed and confounded together: it will bee their terrible aſtoniſhment, and then ſhall all the righteous be wonderfully comforted. Thus the Church is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by terrible things in reſpect of the terror wrought therby in the adverſaries: and the wonder they worke in his ſervants.</p>
            <p>Thirdly the things by which God preſerves his Church, are terrible things in reſpect of the reverence, and awfull regard which they worke, or ſhould worke in all ſorts towards God. Therfore ſome tranſlate the word here, <hi>reverend things:</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <note place="margin">Tremellus.</note> therby things which ſhould cauſe us reverence, &amp; dread that mighty God, who hath done them, and who is for them to be feared. Thus if God deliver by ſome actuall judgment, and vengeance ſhe wed on the adverſaries; this ſhould make us feare and dread him. <hi>I am afraid of thy Judgments</hi> (ſaith <hi>David)</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal 119. 120. Iſa 26 9 Pſal. 21. 11.</note> 
               <hi>And when thy Judgments</hi> (as it is in the Prophet) <hi>are on the earth, the inhabitants therof will learne righteouſnes.</hi> Or if the Lord deliver his Church by overthrowing only the plots and conſpiracies of the wicked, diſappointing them in bringing to paſſe their miſcheife: yet this alſo is a thing <hi>Reverend,</hi> it ſhould cauſe us to reverence him, becauſe he is able to confound the wiſe, and to be-foole the wicked with the workes of their owne hands: or laſtly, if the Lord releive his Church by ſmall meanes, or by unlikely meanes, or by no meanes; yet all this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50293:7"/>
ſhould worke reverence in us, to feare that God, who doth ſo great things in ſo great, and wonderfull, and unexpreſſible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; doing for his Church above all that we can imagine and thinke of.</p>
            <p>Thus every way God delivers and preſerves his Church by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things: we now ſee what theſe are.</p>
            <p>Secondly that God will thus preſerve his people by terrible things (that is) by things ſtriking terror into adverſaries, and working wonder in his children; and which workes, or ſhould worke reverence towards him from all ſorts, three reaſons evince.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God delights to meete with his Churches adverſaries in their owne way: he will out ſhoot them in their owne bow. They deſire to appeare terrible and formidable to it: if they can but put men into feare, they thinke they ſhall have the day: they <note place="margin">Neh. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 10, 11 12, 13.</note> triumph if they can raiſe a terrour and feare in people: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God will ſerve them, as they would ſerve others: he will meete with them in a way of terrout, ſearing them, and making <note place="margin">Prov 28. 1.</note> them ſlie when none purſues. <hi>Adoni-bezek</hi> confeſſed that <hi>ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iudg. 1. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Kings by him had their thumbes and great toes cut off: as I have done ſo God requited me,</hi> ſaith he. <hi>Haman</hi> prepares a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes for <hi>Mordecai;</hi> and the ſame gallowes hangs him. God will be terrible to thoſe who delight to be terrible. <hi>The wicked have drawen out the ſword, and have bent their bow, to caſt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 57. 14.</note> 
               <hi>downe the poore and needy, and to ſlay ſuch as be of upright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: their ſword ſhall enter into their owne heart, and their bowes ſhall be broken.</hi> Cruell terrible men ſhalt be dealt with cruelly at one time or other. <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> ſhewed kindneſſe to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in priſon, and therfore God preſerved him. But the <note place="margin">Ier. 38. 7, 8, 9 10, 11, 12, 13. Ie 39. 16, 17 18.</note> other Princes (which had incenſed the King againſt him) were given up into the hand of their adverſaries. God will be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to thoſe, who ſeeke to put his people into horror and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement. <hi>Paſhur</hi> ſmote <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and put him into the ſtocks all night, he thought to have terrified the Prophet, but the Lord threatens him to be terrified. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jeremiah</hi> from the Lord) <hi>hath not called thy name</hi> Paſhur, <hi>but</hi> Magor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſabib: <note place="margin">Ier. 20. 2.</note> 
               <hi>for thus ſaith the Lord, behold I will make thee a terror to thy ſelfe, and to all thy friends.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:50293:8"/>
2. God will ſave his people by terrible things: becauſe he will ſhew to all the world, how terrible a God he is, whom his people ſo dreadfully and reverentially adore. All ſhall therby underſtand, that he is a God working wonderfully. <hi>Thou art great, and dost wondrous things, thou art God alone:</hi> ſaith the <note place="margin">Pſal. 86. 10.</note> Pſalmiſt. He himſelfe challengeth his creatures to doe as he hath done: <hi>Where waſt thou when I laid the foundation of the world</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iob 38. 4. Iob 40 9.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c. Haſt thou an arme like God, and canſt thou thunder with his voice.</hi> The great ones of the earth, which cauſe others to trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and feare, are hurled up and downe as piles of duſt, in a whirlewinde by the ſmoake of his noſtrills. God will have the world to know, that he is more terrible, then any thing which the world accounts terrible. Wicked and ſinfull men are many times a great terror; <hi>But who art thou</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <note place="margin">Iſa. 51. 12, 13</note> 
               <hi>that are afraid of man who ſhall dye, and of the ſonne of man who ſhall be made as graſſe, and forgets the Lord thy maker. They may deſtroy the body, but when they have done, they can doe no more: but feare God, who can deſtroy both body and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>ſoule in hell fire.</hi> Againe death is the terrible of terribles, ſaith the Philoſopher; adverſaries of the Church are ſo terrible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they come as it were armed with death, and are ready to deſtroy: but yet God is more terrible, for he only can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtict death. It is not the rage, fury, and malice of adverſaries which can cauſe any to die: as God gives life, ſo he takes it away; he makes alive, and he kills. Now God will ſhew himſelfe to be more terrible then they, though they come armed with death by turning their owne terror (death) upon themſelves: <hi>He ſhall bring on them their owne iniquity and ſhall cut them off in their owne wickedneſſe: yea the Lord our God ſhall cut them</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal 94. 23.</note> 
               <hi>off:</hi> And</p>
            <p n="3">3. God will ſave his people by terrible things, that all the earth may ſtand in awe of him, and feare him, and know him only to be God: <hi>Who would not fear thee oh thou King of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ier. 10. 7. and 10. verſes.</note> 
               <hi>there is none like thee &amp;c.</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>The Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlaſting King: at his wrath the earth ſhall tremble, and the nations ſhall not be</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom 9. 17.</note> 
               <hi>able to abide his indignation.</hi> God would be terrible to <hi>Pharoh</hi> in his judgments to get himſelfe a name in all the world: and ſo
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50293:8"/>
he will be to the enemyes of his Church, that the world may know that he is a terrible God, and that the adverſaryes may be <note place="margin">Heb. 12, 28, 29.</note> compelled to cry out, <hi>who is able to dwell with the everlaſting burning:</hi> and likewiſe that his owne people may therby learne to ſerve him acceptably, <hi>with reverence and godly feare:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our God is a conſuming fire. Wicked enemies may kindle a fire to ſcare a Nation, and fill therby a Landfull of terror and trembling; but yet God can keepe his own, ſo as there ſhall not <note place="margin">Iſa 43. 1.</note> paſſe the ſmall of fire on them: for he will be with them when they paſſe through fire and water. How ever; the adverſaries fire ſhall not be a deſtroying fire to Gods Church: for when he beginnes to ſhew himſelfe terrible to them, he will be unto them a conſuming fire: and will quench all the fires, which they have kindled, and ſo free the Land from all their feare: but yet all will be with a terrible deſtruction, to the moſt terrible ones, (continuing unrepentant) among the adverſaries. <hi>Behold all yee that kindle a fire, that compaſſe your ſelves about with</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 50. 11.</note> 
               <hi>ſparkes, walke in the light of your fire and in the ſparkes that you have kindled, this yee ſhall have of mine hands, you ſhall lie downe in ſorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the point is cleared: Becauſe God will ſhew himſelfe to be a God of terror, a God of vengeance, a God to befeared, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, reverenced, and dreaded: therefore he will execute ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things on the wicked; and thereby preſerve his Church and people by terrible things.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We will now ſee what for practice may hence be learned; And briefely.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Seeing God will preſerve his Church and people by terrible things; then ſurely the world muſt expect no other, but terrible things, before the quiet of it, and of the Kingdomes in it, can be eſtabliſhed. If you ſhould heare at any time of terrible battles, of terrible Sea-fights, of terrible conſpiracies, of terrible treaſons, of terrible perſecutions, of terrible maſſacres; yet as our bleſſed Saviour ſaid, ſo ſay I; Let not your hearts be troubled, Ioe I have told you all theſe: theſe things muſt come, but the end is not yet: theſe things muſt be expected, and ſo looked on, that we may ſee and perceive, how that by theſe and the like things, the Lord is working the peace of the world, and of all his Churches in it.

muſt therfore ſtill looke for terrible things, and prepare for them; and a better preparation cannot be made, then to make God our feare and dread. Feare him, and not any terrible thing need to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright us; becauſe he will not ſuffer thoſe who feare him to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry ſpiritually, thorough any trouble.

            <p n="2">2. If God will preſerve the Church by terrible things: then the enemies of it may know, that they can expect nothing, but what is terrible. Indeed the Church her ſelfe muſt looke to heare, and perhaps to feele in ſome meaſure things terrible. A whale may ſwallow <hi>Ionah</hi> a-while, and afterwards reſtore him. Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles may (for ought I know) ſwallow us deeper, though not for deſtruction, but for a better reſtitution: the Church muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to feele leſſe or more things terrible; but her enemies muſt expect to feele the utmoſt deſtroying-ſmart of all things terrible.

And in their due time <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, muſt alſo drink thereof; and by that time it hath gone tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the Kingdomes, the Kings and Rulers of theſe people (whether the cup hath gone) will be all awaked to conſider, <note place="margin">Iſa. 51. 25.</note> how they and their people have beene made to drinke of the cup of trouble, and to reele againe with it: and out of indignation, they will cauſe the Seate of the Beaſt, and the Papacy, in all their Kingdomes (which was the cauſe of their bitter draughts) to drinke up the dregs of it: for the King of <hi>Sheſhach</hi> (a type of <note place="margin">Hieron in loc.</note> Antichriſt, as ſome averre) muſt drinke after them. The ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſts Church for the preſent, in their feares and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettlements, and other moleſtations, are as the pureſt wine: bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50293:9"/>
(I confeſſe) they are, becauſe there is ſomething of Gods frowne in them; and ſomething of their ſinnes to be diſcerned in them, as the cauſe of ſuch ſufferings: but yet theſe ſufferings are nothing in compariſon to the troubles, diſtreſſes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, which ſhall fall on the Nations which are Enemies to the Church: for ſuch muſt drinke up dregs of wrath, which ſhall fill them with horror and aſtoniſhment, and make them reele and ſtagger, and no more keep footing to annoy, and trouble the Churches of the Saints, as they have done formerly. Enemies of God and his Church muſt therefore looke for no other, but terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble over-throwings of their plots, terrible revelations of their treacheries, terrible conſumptions of their deſignes and perſons: and they are to looke for a fearefull expectation of judgement, and for ſome terrible deſtruction whenſoever they come once to be high enough to be deſtroyed, and Gods people low enough to be delivered. And all theſe temporall judgements, ſhall be but as a few drops, before the ſtorme of terror; for God hath appointed a day, wherin the Church ſhall have a full deliverance, and the world a full riddance of all deſtroyers. In which day he will raine on ſuch deſtroyers ſnares, fire, and brimſtone, and <note place="margin">Pſal. 11. 6.</note> an horrible tempeſt, this ſhall be the portion of their cup.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If God will preſerve his Church by terrible things: then let us all feare this great and terrible God. Conſider that he can avenge himſelfe with terror on thoſe, who feare him not. The <note place="margin">Ier. 5. 21. 22. &amp;c.</note> Lord chides his people, for not conſidering what he hath done, can doe, and daily doth, that ſo they might be provoked to fear him. All of us are naturally prone to feare men, when they are terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. We uſually feare a man of power, who is able to doe us a ſhrewd turne, to moleſt our eſtate, ſpoile our goods; who can reſtraine us in our libertie, or imbitter any of our comforts: at the approach of ſuch, men quake and tremble; Let us be much more ready to feare, and reverence the great God, who is able to doe terrible things, above all that the moſt terrible of men can doe: for men can doe no more then what he permitts, but <hi>Hee doth whatſoever he will in heaven and in earth.</hi> He can ſoone <note place="margin">Pſal. 115. 3.</note> blow on thine eſtate, bring thee to povertie, lay on thee ſicknes, exerciſe thee with paine, and faſten thee to a priſon; he can ſcare thee with viſions, and terrifie thee with dreames; he can awaken
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50293:10"/>
conſcience, and ſmite the ſoule, and make a man a terror to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Feare therefore this dreadfull God; and conſidering how terrible he hath already beene to Enemies, be perſwaded the more to dread him. They have oft moleſted, and he hath as oft reſcued his people; they have deviſed miſcheife, but he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated it: they have roſe in tumults, and he hath ever ſtilled the tumults, and the madneſſe of the people; though they have been mighty, yet the Lord is more mighty: who will cut off the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Princes, and who is terrible to the Kings of the earth. So <note place="margin">Pſal. 76. 12.</note> terrible a God he is, that he ought to be reverenced, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pſalmiſt having related what combinations there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt and his people, (though Chriſt will breake them all in peeces like a Potters veſſell) concludes with an exhortation to ſerve the Lord with feare, &amp; to rejoyce with trembling. <hi>Kiſſe the Sonne leaſt he be angry, and yee periſh from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little, bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</hi> Let therefore all that heare of the Lords terror an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 12.</note> feare him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Seeing God preſerves his Church by terrible things; then let us all be thankfull, when at any time by terrible things he hath preſerved his Church. Shew your thankfulneſſe by ſpeaking of it, and by admiring his goodneſſe in it; and by reſolving to live in his feare: and as men knowing thereby the terror of the Lord, perſwade your ſelves and others to be faithfull; this is true thankfulneſſe. Bleſſe then God, for not ſuffering wicked plots, wicked ſtratagems, wicked deſignes to proſper and take effect. If God at any time curbes wicked inſolencies, obſerve it. Hee ſometimes breakes here, and ſometimes there an arme, weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereby his Churches adverſaries: and this is to them terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but to his ſervants comfortable; and ſo much the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable it will be, if it makes them truſt and relye on him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for helpe. True thankefulneſſe will not truſt on men, nor on the ſonnes of men, for they are vaine. <hi>England</hi> perhaps may heareof ſo many thouſand horſe, and ſo many thouſand foot, of ſuch and ſuch a great fleete of ſhips, which intend to have a-bout with her: but let us not be diſmaied: for the Lord ſure hath yet ſome terrible thing to ſhew on the adverſaries of <hi>England;</hi> and he will come riding on the chariots of ſalvation to helpe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50293:10"/>
it. There are who confidently affirme, that by the <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean</hi> Church (ſpoke of in the Revelation) the luke-warm Church, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Brightman</hi> in Apocalyps.</note> the Lord meanes the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church: though I will not peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily affirme it, yet thereupon I dare boldly make this inference; That if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church be the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Church, then if it will, but heare the voyce of Chriſt, and open the doore to him, if it will become an obedient Church, and repent of its ſinnes; and if its children would once cordially and ſeriouſly reforme their lives, then Chriſt will come in and ſuppe with it. And we are told what the ſupper is, which the great God hath provided; It is in breife, what may be read at large; the utter deſtruction in it of the beaſt and falſe Prophet, and of ſuch who combine with them to ſet up the tyranny of the Roman Papacy. So ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <note place="margin">Revel. 19, 17. 18.</note> God will be to ſuch, that the very fore-thoughts of it, ſhould cheere up our ſpirits, and fill us full of thankefull expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of helpe from on high, that though all nations ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe us about, (and it may be they will before all be done at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it;) yet repentant <hi>England,</hi> ſhall in the name of the Lord deſtroy them all. Chriſt will come and ſuppe in it, and it ſhall ſuppe with him; He rejoycing at <hi>Englands</hi> amendment, and new obedience, and it enjoying his comforts and deliverances. The God of our Salvation will thus ſave and preſerve by terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things in righteouſneſſe, So much of the firſt obſervation. The Second is this. Gods deliverance of his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by terrible things is in righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>The meaning of the point is this. God in all the deliverances of his people by terrible things, doth therein manifeſt his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. He doth therein nothing but what is righteous, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to righteouſnes and juſtice. To cleare this, conſider that there is a double righteouſnes. The righteouſneſſe of his word; which is the righteouſneſſe of his faithfulnes: and the righteouſnes of his works, or his juſt acts of righteouſneſſe. And God doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt both theſe in his deliverance of his people by terrible things.</p>
            <p>Firſt God in delivering his people by terrible things, doth it according to his righteous word. Now there is a double righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God in his word. There is his righteouſneſſe of fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his word of promiſe. And there is his righteouſneſſe of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50293:11"/>
his word of threatning. And both are manifeſt in the Churches deliverance by terrible things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Gods delivering his people by terrible things is in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; that is, it is according to the word of his promiſe. He is faithfull to keepe covenant with his ſervants. Heaven and earth <note place="margin">Math. 24. 35. Iob. 5 19. Pſal 50. 15. Pſal. 92. 14 15. 16.</note> ſhall paſſe, but not a word of his promiſe ſhall fall in vaine. And God hath in many places promiſed to his people deliverance. The laſt of the quotations in the margent, is to be underſtood of Chriſt miſticall: of Chriſt together with all his faithfull members. God delivered <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and it was terrible, by over-throwing <hi>Pharoh</hi> and all his hoaſt; and yet in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe too, according to his righteous word: as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhewes. The word of promiſe is fulfilled, when the deliverance is by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <note place="margin">Deut. 7. 8 9.</note> things, it is therefore in righteouſneſſe. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. Gods delivering by terrible things is in righteouſneſſe, that is, according to his word of threatning; that the word of his threatning might come on the adverſaries, and be fulfilled. God in many places hath threatned them. He by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> gives a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſe to his Church, but a terrible threatning to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of it. The words are theſe. <hi>All they that devoure thee ſhall be devoured; and all thine enemies every one of them ſhall goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ier. 30. 16.</note> 
               <hi>captivity, and they that ſpoyle thee, ſhall be ſpoyled; and all that prey on thee will I give for a prey: for I will reſtore health unto thee, and I will heale thee of thy wound, ſaith the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they called thee an outcaſt, ſaying this is Zion, whom no man ſeekes after.</hi> And that the Lord will accompliſh all this in the laſt day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> (it may be in our times or a very little after us) the 23. and 24. verſes ſhewes. So that when God delivers his people by terrible things, as by confounding and undoing their adverſaries, and their forces; all is but a fulfilling his word of righteouſneſſe, his righteous threats. And thus Gods deliverance is ſaid to be in righteouſneſſe, according to his righteous word.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God in delivering by terrible things, doth it in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; that is, he therein declares his righteous facts, that they are very righteous. There is a double act of Gods juſtice or righteouſneſſe manifeſt in it. 1. His righteouſneſſe in righting a wronged world. And 2. His righteouſneſſe in revenging it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a wronging world; or on thoſe adverſaries of his people which wrong them.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:50293:11"/>
1. God by delivering his people by terrible things doth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly right a wronged world he therby rights his oppreſſed wronged people, eaſing and releiving them. So the Prophet: <hi>As for my people children are their oppreſſors, and women rule over them: oh my people! they which lead thee, cauſe thee to erre,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 3. 12. 13.</note> 
               <hi>and deſtroy the way of thy paths: the Lord ſtandeth up to plead, and ſtandeth to judge the people. &amp;c.</hi> and ſo the Pſalmiſt. <hi>For the oppreſſion of the poore, for the ſighing of the needy, now I will ariſe ſaith the Lord, and will ſet him in ſafety from him</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 12. 5.</note> 
               <hi>that paſſeth at him.</hi> An excellent deſcription of a ſtate wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church, which is a tree ſhaken, the windes from all corners conſpiring to blow it downe, it craks and ſhakes, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies like winde puffes and blowes, and makes a buſſell: but the Lord lookes from Heaven, he heares the groanes and ſighes at laſt of his afflicted people; and at length ſtills theſe windes and ſcatters them, and ſo the Kingdome and Church ſtands, and is in ſafety. As when ſome honeſt traveller in his journey, falls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theeves; they unſtrip him and riffle him and are ſearching him, when ſuddenly (while the poore man is in perplexity) ſome noble man rides by, ſeeing his diſtreſſe, pitties him, and comes in with power, and ſets him free from ſuch violence, and beates and ſmites thoſe who moleſted him, giving them according to their deſerts. So it is; the poore Church is a traveller to Heaven, beſet with enemies of all ſorts, who thinke to riffle her, and leave her poore, naked, deſtitute and wounded: but then the Lord comes riding in his excellency to her help: and reſcues his Church. Thus <note place="margin">Deut. 33. 26.</note> he rights a wronged world and thus he ſhewes his righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God by delivering his people by terrible things doth it in righteouſneſſe; becauſe he doth therby avenge himſelfe on the wronging world. <hi>It is a righteous thing with God to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence tribulation to them that trouble you.</hi> It is indeede a very <note place="margin">2 Theſ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 6.</note> righteous thing for God to bring troubles on them. 1. It is a righteous thing to bring vengance on them, for their wronging himſelfe; for they fight againſt him, who warre againſt the <note place="margin">Acts 9. 4. Iſa. 37. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>9.</note> Church, they perſecute him, who perſecute it: they rage againſt him, who rage againſt his people: and God will avenge the wrong done unto him by thoſe, who attempt to roote out ſuch, who keepe up his honour in the world. It is a righteous
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50293:12"/>
thing therfore to trouble ſuch. And 2. ſo it is to take vengance on them for the wrong, which they do unto his people. <hi>The wicked and him that loveth violence his ſoule hates.</hi> The Lord will be avenged on unmercifull men: <hi>There ſhall be judgement</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 11. 5.</note> 
               <hi>without mercie on thoſe that will ſhew no mercie.</hi> And therfore it is juſt with God, to render tribulation to thoſe, who have <note place="margin">Iames 2. 13.</note> injured and unmercifully uſed his Church and people. Thus it is evident that the Churches deliverance is in righteouſneſſe: the righteouſneſſe both of his word of promiſe, and of his word of threatning, and the righteouſneſſe of his juſtice both in right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a wronged world, and in revenging himſelfe on a wronging world, is therby made manifeſt.</p>
            <p>This truth ſerves. 1. To vindicate Gods juſtice. 2. To terrifie the Churches adverſaries. 3. To encourage all Gods faithfull people.</p>
            <p>Firſt let it ſerve to vindicate the Lords juſtice from any aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Men are ready (when things fall out otherwiſe then they would have them) to charge God fooliſhly, when they ſee terrible things falling out in the world [as terrible attempts, terrible maſſacres, terrible impoveriſhing of a nation, terrible executions of wrath] they are ready to ſay, that they ſee not how God ſhould be juſt in puniſhing them, by theſe things, more then others, who deſerves (in their apprehenſions) as much yea more then they: but ſuch murmurers ſhould conſider that God doth all in righteouſneſſe: he can and will do no other then that which is righteous. It becomes every holy man ſeeing things falling out otherwiſe then he would, to conclude with the Church: I will beare the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I <note place="margin">Mica. 7 9.</note> have ſinned againſt him. If God cull thee out to ſcare thee from thy ſinnes by terrible things; ſay thou (when theſe things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen) that God is righteous, and will deliver his people by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things in righteouſneſſe: for he brings terrible things upon the world, to keepe the inhabitants therof from ſinning. <hi>When thy judgements</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>are on the earth, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa 26 9. Pſal. 52. 5. 6. Iſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>9 5. 6. 7. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>therof will learne righteouſneſſe.</hi> And the Lord doth ſo therby to worke alſo the world, to an awfull reverence of him and to ſtirre up his owne therby, to a greater fervency, and importunity in praying to him for deliverance: and therfore
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50293:12"/>
never charge God with any kinde of injuſtice in his ſaving and defending his people, or in ruinating his adverſaries by terrible things, and by terrible meanes, but ſay as the Pſalmiſt: <hi>I know</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 75.</note> 
               <hi>oh Lord that thy judgements are right and that thou haſt in faithfullneſſe afflicted me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. Gods delivering his Church and people by terrible things in righteouſnes, ſheweth unto us what the adverſaries are to expect: namely no more (and that is enough) but that God ſhould deale with them in righteouſneſſe, and recompence them according to their deedes. This <hi>Babylon</hi> of <hi>Caldea</hi> found, ſhe ſpoiled, peeled, robbed, and ſubjected the nations, and God ſent ſpoilers accordingly unto her, who dealt with her, as ſhe had dealt with others: the Prophet gives the reaſon: <hi>for the Lord God of recompences ſhall ſurely requite.</hi> The weſterne <hi>Romiſh</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iere. 51. 36.</note> 
               <hi>Babylon</hi> muſt, &amp; ſhall find the like: God will bring upon her ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and deſtroyers, and ſuch who will undoubtedly reward her, <note place="margin">Revel. 18. 5. 6. 7. 8.</note> as ſhe hath ſerved the Saints. Yea all enemies ſhall be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced according to their dealings, with the Church, for God will deliver it by terrible things in righteouſneſſe. They may for a while plot, and project, and attempt, and ſome times ſeeme to thrive: but their plotting will in the end ruine themſelves. <hi>For the Lord will be knowne by the Iudgment which he executeth:</hi> and that judgment is no more but this: <hi>the wicked is ſnared in the workes of his owne hands.</hi> Adverſaries of the Church muſt <note place="margin">Pſal. 9. 16.</note> looke for no other, then to eate the bread of their owne baking, and to drinke of their owne brewing. Their terribleneſſe to the Church ſhall be meaſured out, in a full cup to them, in that which is terrible unto them; for God is righteous, and in his due time he will deliver his Church by terrible things in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly Gods delivering his Church or people by terrible things in righteouſneſſe, ſhould incourage all the followers after righteouſneſſe: ſuch who ſeeke the Lord and delight to walke, and be found in a way of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe. All things to the outward appearance may ſeeme to worke ruine, and goe croſſe; but they ſhall undoubtedly worke in the end to the ruine of adverſaries; for God will deliver but in righteouſneſſe. The Lord remembers the righteous cauſe of his ſervants; and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50293:13"/>
though it may be a while oppreſſed, yet it ſhall never be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and deſtroyed; for he will againe bring on the cauſe of religion: and will maintaine in the world a people ſerving him, in deſpite of hell, and of <hi>Rome</hi> which he will deſtroy in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. And though your owne Perſons may be tooke away, yet ſtill be incouraged to keepe faith, and a good conſcience; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord will preſerve a ſeede of worſhippers, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire the loſſe of his Church, by a more plentifull increaſe of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <note place="margin">Pſal. 22. 30. 31.</note> to the adverſary, and of comfort to all thoſe, who are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the land. And therefore let us all from this point be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To waite contentedly on God, till he worke for his people in righteouſneſſe: ſo the Church did. <hi>In the way of thy judgments have we waited for thee.</hi> Looke for him as coming to reſcue and deliver, for he will doe ſo, when we are fully fitted for it. <note place="margin">Iſa 26. 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Be encouraged alſo to cry the more earneſtly to God to come and ſave his people in righteouſneſſe: ſo did the Church. <hi>Oh that thou wouldeſt rend the heavens, that thou wouldeſt come downe, that the mountaines might flow downe at thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 64. 1. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c. to make thy name knowne to thine adverſaries, that the nations may tremble at thy preſence when thou dideſt terrible things which we looked not for, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Be incouraged to take notice of every particular act of Gods helping any wayes in righteouſneſſe: it is an excellent meanes to gaine comfort in diſcomfortable times. <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth, and worketh righteouſneſſe, thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee in thy wayes.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 64. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Let us all be encouraged to put our ſelves into ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we may be ready to be delivered in righteouſneſſe, when God will ſave and preſerve us: and that is in few words: ſtudy righteouſneſſe, ſeeke righteouſneſſe, thirſt after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, deſire to be found in a way of righteouſneſſe. The more we looke after and apply our ſelves to the righteouſneſſe of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification or holineſſe, the fitter ſhall we be to be ſaved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in righteouſneſſe. Let it be your prime and principall care not to be found in your owne righteouſneſſe, (for that is very odious) but in Chriſts. Labour to be found in him; and when God comes to deliver in righteouſneſſe he will eſpy your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50293:13"/>
ſprinkled by the blood of Chriſt, and thereby purged from dead workes: he will diſcerne that your hearts are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſpirit of Chriſt, the ſpirit of righteouſneſſe, and that your lifes are conformable to the life of Chriſt who is the ſonne of righteouſneſſe, and finding you thus, he will deliver you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his faithfull people in righteouſneſſe, though he ſmites terribly the adverſaries of his Saints: for by terrible things in righteouſneſſe he anſwers us the God of our ſalvation. And ſo much for the ſecond obſervation.</p>
            <p>The third is this. The deliverance of the Church by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things, is Gods anſwering his people.</p>
            <p>Gods anſwering implyes ſome things done by the people of God, and ſome things done by him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It implyes that his people prayed unto him for deliverance: and that he gives a gracious audience, and full-fillance of their prayer. <hi>I will looke</hi> (as it is in the Prophet) <hi>to the Lord, I will</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Micah. 7. 7.</note> 
               <hi>waite for the God of my ſalvation, my God ſhall heare me,</hi> the Church ſpeakes in prayer, and God heares her in granting her prayers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It implyes that his people expects mercies from him, and Gods anſwering them is his affording helpe, his reall contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuccour unto them. <hi>They looked unto him</hi> (ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt) <note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 5, 6</note> 
               <hi>and were lightned, and their faces were not aſhamed, this poore man cryed, and the Lord heard him, and ſaved him out of all his troubles,</hi> his people expects mercy: and his anſwer, is the fulfilling of their expectation. <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith <hi>Habbakuk)</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hab. 2. 1.</note> 
               <hi>ſtand upon my watch, and ſet me upon the tower, and will watch to ſee what he will ſay unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then Gods deliverance of his people is an anſwering their prayers, and an anſwering their expectations. They pray for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance and he gives it: they expect it from him, and anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly it comes to paſſe. Gods delivering of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of Aegypt was an anſwering of their prayers: <hi>I have heard</hi> (ſaith God) <note place="margin">Exod. 3. 7. 8.</note> 
               <hi>their cry, by reaſon of their taſkemaſters for I know their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and I am come downe to deliver them.</hi> When he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them at the red ſea, it was an anſwer to the prayer of his ſervant <hi>Moſes:</hi> The Lord ſaid then unto him, why cryeſt thou <note place="margin">Exod. 14. 15.</note> to me. When he gave <hi>Iſraell</hi> victory over <hi>Amaleck,</hi> he then
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50293:14"/>
anſwered the prayer of <hi>Moſes</hi> on the mount while <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>Iſraell</hi> fought in the valley. His deliverance of his people from <hi>Jabin,</hi> from the <hi>Midianites,</hi> yea from all their other enemies at any time, all was an anſwering of their prayers, and expectations. They prayed in faith for deliverance, and they waited in faith, untill God had given a full deliverance; and ſo deliverance was but Gods anſwering his people.</p>
            <p>Becauſe God uſually giveth not unto his Church and People deliverance, till they have ſought and ſued to him earneſtly for it. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will yet for this be inquired of by the houſe of Iſraell, to do it for them;</hi> though he knowes that his Church doth need deliverance, yet he will have his Church to be <note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 37</note> apprehenſive and ſenſible of that her need: for he will have from it, the honour of his mercie towards it: and of his providence and care over it, as alſo of his wiſdome, power, and juſtice in confounding all its adverſaries by terrible things.</p>
            <p>This point teaches. 1. To pray for deliverance that God with it may anſwer us: And 2. To obſerve Gods ſeverall anſwers unto his people, by giving unto them the deliverances pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.</p>
            <p>Firſt. If deliverance be Gods anſwering his people: then ſurely it concernes all the people of God to put up prayers for deliverance. Prayer muſt preceed deliverance: and deliverance is the returne of prayer in a gracious anſwer of it. We muſt be praying men, and men expecting deliverance as an iſſue and conſequent of prayer; and that our prayers may be anſwered, we are to put up no other then ſuch, which God will anſwer: as namely,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let our prayers be prayers of faith, coming from a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heart. Aske and doubt not; beleeve the promiſes of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, <note place="margin">Mark. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>3</note> and confidently rely on Gods word to be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and from aſſurance that God will fullfill his word, put up prayers. Both the cloud of promiſes, and the cloud of witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, perſons, families, kingdomes, Churches, which from time to time have beene delivered, and the conſideration that the Lords hand is not ſhortned, ſhould prevaile with us not to doubt, but to pray for deliverance in faith: not doubting, but that God will anſwer us.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:50293:14"/>
2. Let our prayers be in humility. <hi>A broken, and a contrite heart God will not deſpiſe. He heares the prayers of the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 17.</note> 
               <hi>deſtitute.</hi> Pray for deliverance in humilitie, and it ſhall be granted as an anſwer to an humble prayer. <hi>Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God that hee may exalt you in due time.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Let our prayers be importunately earneſt without faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>I have</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt <hi>waited long and ſought the Lord: oh my Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I cry in the day time, but thou heareſt not, and in the night ſeaſon I am not ſilent.</hi> The Lord ſometimes <note place="margin">Pſal. 22. 2.</note> delayes deliverance, to make us importunately wraſtle with him in prayer for it: and ſo it may be the anſwer of our earneſt prayers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let our prayers be ſanctifiedly performed: with hearts which are departed from iniquity. <hi>If I</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 66. 18.</note> 
               <hi>iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not heare me. Sinne cauſeth him hide his face that he will not heare.</hi> If we pray <note place="margin">Iſa. 59. 1, 2.</note> for deliverance, let us pray lifting up pure hands from an holy heart: and then God will give deliverance as an anſwer to our prayers, which are thus prayers of faithfull, humble, importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ſanctified petitioners.</p>
            <p>Secondly if the deliverance of the Church by terrible things be Gods anſwering it: then let us obſerve Gods ſeverall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers unto his people in his giving ſeverall deliverances from time to time. Indeede we muſt not looke to ſee an anſwer to ſome of our requeſts at all in our owne time; we muſt not think to live to ſee the accompliſhing of the number of Gods elect: or the putting an end to the dayes of ſinne or the making of the Church and people of God compleatly glorious.</p>
            <p>Again it may be, we may not live to ſee the anſwer, of many of our other petitions, which are put up, and for which we are to expect daily tydings, of ſome preparations, at leaſt towards their accompliſhment: as namely the calling of the <hi>Jewes:</hi> the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpell at once into all places: the joint profeſſion of Chriſt publiquely and unanimouſly in all kingdomes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all people: prayers for ſuch things are put up by us (it may be) in our age, but the ages to come will ſee the fruites of them: only this know, that when the heart firmely beleeves
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50293:15"/>
the truth of theſe things, and that God will in his due time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh theſe, then ther is ſome anſwer of our prayers: becauſe the ſame ſpirit which inables a man to pray for theſe, workes beleefe, and carryes the eye of the ſoule, to looke beyond all difficulties, and all times, and by faith to ſee them as certainely, as if they were already come to paſſe. <hi>Thus Abraham by faith ſaw the day of Chriſt and rejoyced:</hi> and ſo we by faith ſee the anſwer of all the petitions, we have put up: and we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce <note place="margin">Iohn 8. 56.</note> therfore; knowing that when they ſhall be granted, the grant of them will be every way anſwerable to that which we formerly beleeved and prayed for.</p>
            <p>But moreover ther are ſome things which it pleaſeth God to bring to paſſe in our times: as perhaps ſome particular mercies, for our ſelves, or others, or for the whole Church: now after prayer, we muſt waite for an anſwer, therby ſhewing our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency on God: ſo the Pſalmiſt: <hi>As the eyes of ſervants looke unto the hand of their maſters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her miſtreſſe, ſo our eyes waite upon the Lord</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal 113. 2.</note> 
               <hi>our God untill that he have mercie upon us.</hi> It may be God will not grant that very deliverance which hath been prayed for, but ſome other; yet then the prayer is anſwered, though not in the very particular which was deſired.</p>
            <p>A man perhaps prayeth that God would roote out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all enemies: God pleaſeth to cut off ſome, but he will not ſlay all, leaſt his people forget it, and therfore he ſcatters them by his power and brings them downe. And though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 11.</note> God give not a ſpeedy deliverance: yet he anſwers the prayer for the preſent, when the heart is afterward more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and more carefull to walke with God; and is more depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on him; and is ſtill more earneſt to ſeeke and cry unto him: and is thankefull for any favour though never ſo little: for any deliverance, for any ſafety vouchſafed from time to time, and ſtill continued. Likewiſe God heares our prayers, and for the preſent giveth an anſwer unto them, or rather aſſurance, that he will in due time anſwer them; when he filleth the heart with content to be denyed, and to magnifie him however. Thus let us pray, but with an expectation of an anſwer to our prayers. When God gives deliverance, it will be an anſwer to the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50293:15"/>
deſires, wiſhes, longings, and expectations of his people: by terrible things thou wilt anſwer oh God of our ſalvation. So much for the third obſervation.</p>
            <p>The fourth is this. God is the Author of his peoples ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or deliverance.</p>
            <p>Salvation or the deliverance of Gods people is every wher a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto God in ſcripture. <hi>God is ſtiled the hope of Iſraell</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ier. 14. 8.</note> 
               <hi>the Saviour therof in the time of trouble: and the Church is ſtiled a people ſaved by the Lord:</hi> as if the maine care of God <note place="margin">Deut 33. 29.</note> were to ſave and deliver his people. <hi>Salvation belongs to the Lord, and his bleſſing is upon his people: and he only workes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 3. 8.</note> 
               <hi>ſalvation in the midſt of the earth. I even I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>am the Lord, and beſides me ther is no Saviour.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 74. 12. Iſa. 43. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding of this title know: that there is a double ſalvation ſpoke of in ſcripture. 1. There is a ſpirituall ſalvation from ſinne and Satan, and the power of both, and from Hell. And 2. There is a temporall ſalvation, which is Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of his people, from outward temporall afflictions, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, and diſtreſſes under which they are. I take the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is cheifely intended in this title of God, as it ſtands in the text; yet the other muſt not be excluded. A word or two of both.</p>
            <p>Firſt if we referre this title here given to God, to the ſpirituall ſalvation, then it may be very evident to us that he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe he calls us to ſalvation. He did ordeine us to it, and <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5 9.</note> he hath called us therunto. Our ſoules were running headlong to Hell and perdition but God called us back from the pit. We were as ſheepe ſtraying, but God hath called us by his word, and ſuch who liſten to it and obey it, returne from the way of deſtruction, and are ſaved. Beſides Gods call to ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He putteth men into it. The very entrance which any make into it is from him, Man is naturally averſe therunto; he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to paſſe thorough ſo many difficulties, to undergoe ſo much mortification, ſelfe denyall, crucifying of the world: and to aſpire to ſo much heavenly mindedneſſe as is requiſite. It is the Lord only, who makes the heart, and ſoule overlooke all this and a great deale more. It is he only who raiſeth up the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50293:16"/>
ſpirit, to a reſolution to go thorough all, to follow him in all. <hi>My ſoule</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>followeth hard after thee.</hi> As a child <note place="margin">Pſal 63. 8.</note> doth what he can to keepe company with his father: ſo he ſtill applyed himſelfe what he could to imitate his heavenly father. God only brings the ſpirit to this, that though it hath many diſcouragements, doubts, and troubles, and hath ſpent much of its time in by, and ſinfull thoughts, and wayes; yet now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put into the way of ſalvation, it goes on in a way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines and righteouſnes, and is ſure to meete with perfected ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation at the laſt. <hi>We have a ſtrong City, ſalvation will God</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>6. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>appoint for walls and bulwarks: open yee the gate that the rightous nation which keepeth the truth may enter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The progreſſe and perfecting in the way of ſalvation is from God. The God of all grace, who hath called us into his eternall glory <hi>by Chriſt Ieſus after that yee have ſuffered a</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 10.</note> 
               <hi>while, will make you perfect, ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, and ſettle you.</hi> God perfects, and God guides us to ſalvation: he guides with his eye, and after he will receive us up to glorie. It is his <note place="margin">Pſal. 32. 8.</note> worke to make us perſevere unto the end, and to bring his people to eſtabliſhment, ſtrength, ſettlement, and perfection in piety and goodnes, ſalvation is of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The crowning of his people with everlaſting ſalvation is from God. God will give heavenly ſalvation to thoſe who by <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 7.</note> patient continuance in well doing ſeeke for glory and honour, and immortality, eternall life.</p>
            <p>Thus in reſpect of the ſpirituall ſalvation of his people, God may well be ſtiled the God of our ſalvation. But the text ſpeaks moſt properly of ſuch things, wherby we may more properly here aſcribe unto him this title, as it hath reference to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall ſalvation, or deliverance of Gods people: though in the application we ſhall make uſe of it both wayes.</p>
            <p>Secondly then this title <hi>(oh God of our ſalvation)</hi> relates to his temporall ſalvation, of his people wherof we will conſider 1. The parts of it: 2. The reaſons of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Temporall ſalvation hath ſeverall parts: or rather it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to us ſeverall wayes: and God is the Author of every one of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is preventing ſalvation, when the Lord prevents his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50293:16"/>
peoples meeting with a danger, then he ſaves them. If a man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way in his journey were told that theeves did lie in waite for him, and therupon he turnes aſide a little, and eſcapes them, this is a danger prevented. The Lord doth many thouſand times thus ſave his people: <hi>thou preventeſt me</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>with thy</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 21. 3.</note> 
               <hi>goodneſſe.</hi> God was then ſaving <hi>Iacob</hi> and his family, when he ſent <hi>Ioſeph</hi> into Aegypt: he then prevented their periſhing in <note place="margin">Gen. 50 20. Math. 2. 13.</note> the famine. He prevented <hi>Herods</hi> ſlaying Chriſt by ſending an Angell to forewarne the danger. Gods people are oft ignorant that evill is deviſed, contrived, proſecuted againſt them, but God prevents it, and ſaves them, and afterward they come to underſtand ſo much. <hi>I will ſay of the Lord he is my refuge, and my fortreſſe: my God in him will I truſt: he ſhall deliver from</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal 91. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>the ſnare of the hunter, and from the noiſome peſtilence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a preparing ſalvation which is from God. I call that preparing ſalvation wherby the Lord ſits his people to meet with adverſaries, dangers troubles and perplexites. The Lords preparing his people to it, is his ſaving them from it. <hi>Thou haſt</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>girded me with ſtrength unto the battle.</hi> Thus the <note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 43.</note> Lords eſtabliſhing the heart with grace to beare a trouble, and the Lords giving unto the ſpirit comfort and conſolation in the midſt of the thoughts within: and the Lords ſpeaking peace to the ſoule, when all the world is in tumults, and the Lords feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoule and ſpirit within with joyes and expectations of comfort in himſelfe in heaven; when the haile rattles on the tiles and there is no peace abroad: theſe &amp; a thouſand other wayes are part of the ſalvation which God workes for his people. It is his preparing ſalvation, or his preparing them for ſafety againſt the trouble which they incounter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is an upholding ſalvation, when any is kept from periſhing in a danger or trouble: and this is alſo from the Lord. <hi>I was ſore thruſt at that I might fall, the Lord ſuſteined</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 118. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>3.</note> 
               <hi>me.</hi> And ſo the Lord ſaves, when he upholds from periſhing. If we were let alone the trouble would overmaſter; the waters are perhaps ſo deepe, they would drowne: the fire ſo raging, it would devoure. But if God upholds, holds us by the chinne that we ſinke not: if he carrieth us through the fire and water, through all, and we be preſerved; then he vouchſafes his up holding ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, wherby we periſh not.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:50293:17"/>
4. There is an eſtabliſhing or confirming ſalvation: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one is ſo ſtrengthned, that no troubles, nor adverſaries can out daunt them. <hi>My arme</hi> (as it is in the Pſalmiſt) <hi>ſhall hold him up, and my arme ſhall ſtrengthen him.</hi> When a man walkes in ſlippery dangerous wayes, and then is eſtabliſhed that he <note place="margin">Pſal. 89. 21.</note> treades confidently and ſlips not: here is ſalvation, troubles, croſſes, afflictions, adverſaries, are occaſions of falling: but when the Lord notwithſtanding this, keepeth up our feete that they ſlip not, it is his ſalvation and a deliverance, <hi>Thou haſt delivered my feete</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>from falling.</hi> The Church is deſcribed <note place="margin">Pſal. 116. 8. Cant. 8. 5.</note> coming out from the wilderneſſe, leaning on her beloved. Gods people may be in many troubles and perplexities, in a wildernes, at a maſe, not knowing what way to turne, but the Lord up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, and eſtabliſhes them, and brings them out of all, but lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their beloved. The Church partakes of eſtabliſhing ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is alſo another part or manifeſtation of ſalvation; which we may call reſcuing ſalvation: when the Lord ſuffers his people to come into danger, and trouble, and to be as it were in the enemies hand, and yet then he ſnatches them out and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcues them. As <hi>David</hi> did ſtrike in, and take a lambe out of the mouth of the lion and of the beare: ſo the Lord ſtrikes in to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue <note place="margin">Pſal. 44 4</note> his ſervants, commanding deliverances for his peeple. He ſuffers them ſometimes to come to the mouth, but he gives them not up a prey to the teeth, but then delivers them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There is a crowning ſalvation, or a compaſſing about with ſongs of deliverance: when God putteth his people into a ſtate and condition of ſecurity, that no evill ſhall ſurprize them to their dammage. And this is the higheſt pitch of temporall ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and God is the author of it. God is my King of old work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſalvation in the midſt of the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus from all theſe parts, or degrees rather of temporall <note place="margin">Pſal. 74. 22.</note> ſalvation, it is plaine: that God is the God of our ſalvation. Thus of the parts of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The reaſon proving that God is the Author of his peoples deliverance is this in ſtead of many others. In him are to be found all thoſe things, which are effectuall, to worke the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his people out of troubles. For in the ſalvation, which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50293:17"/>
he grants to his people are to be ſeene theſe footeſteps of Gods glory.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His pitty and compaſſion towards his people. There is in him towards them the ſounding of bowells; and he will ſurely <note place="margin">Ier. 31. 20.</note> have mercy on them. Out of his compaſſion he ſtands (as it were) deliberating what to doe: <hi>How ſhall I give thee up E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim? how ſhall I deliver thee Iſraell? how ſhall I make thee</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hoſea. 11. 8.</note> 
               <hi>as Admah? how ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together &amp;c.</hi> And we finde that when the people confeſſed there ſinne ſaying doe to us what thou pleaſeſt, only deliver us this once: then the ſoule <note place="margin">Iudg. 10. 16</note> of God was greived for <hi>Iſraell,</hi> his pitty moves him to help.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God is omniſcient: he only knowes how to deliver his, <hi>The Lord knowes how to deliver the godly out of temptation:</hi> he is only infinitely wiſe, and knowes all purpoſes, policyes, <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 9.</note> engines, inſtruments, which attempt any thing againſt his people: he knowes what they can worke to the utmoſt: and he knowes how to defeate their working: to inſnare them in their owne net. <hi>He ſitts in heaven, and ſees, and laughs the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>of his Church to ſcorne.</hi> He ſuffers them a while to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and weary themſelves in plotting and ruining his people; and then on the ſudden he turnes all upon themſelves: having them all in deriſion. As when a man overlookes a company of boyes buſie in making clay walls and caſtles; and heares them talke that they will deſtroy hereby any who meddles with them: he laughs at them, and ſuddenly comes in, and breakes all their workes in peices, and ſets them all on crying and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, even ſo the Lord is wiſe to underſtand fully all the adverſaries attempts: he laughs, at them, and ſuddenly breaks their power, and fills them with wailing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God is all ſufficient to reſcue and ſave his people, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them out of all their troubles. He only is able to ſave. So he is deſcribed by the prophet: <hi>Who is this that cometh from</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 63. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Edom with died garments, from Bozra, this that is glorious in his apparell, travelling in the greatneſſe of his ſtrength, I that ſpeake in righteouſneſſe mighty to ſave.</hi> Nothing can withſtand his power, with a ſtrong hand he brought his people out of <note place="margin">Pſal. 44. 4.</note> Aegypt. Deliverances are at his command. <hi>Knoweſt thou not</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:50293:18"/>
(ſaid our bleſſed Saviour to <hi>Peter) that I can pray to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he ſhall preſently give me more then twelve legions</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Math. 26. 53.</note> 
               <hi>of Angells.</hi> All the Armyes in heaven, and earth are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him. He is able to raiſe up, and fit inſtruments to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverers of his people from them, that ſpoile and diſtreſſe them. The <hi>Midianites</hi> thought to overbeare <hi>Iſraell</hi> with multitude, <note place="margin">Pſal. 47. 9.</note> and mighty Armies; but the Lord raiſed up <hi>Gideon,</hi> and made him ſucceſſefull, that the <hi>Midianites</hi> helped to ſlay one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo he utterly diſcomfited them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God is very watchfull to do his people good, &amp; to give deliverance. <hi>Behold he that keepeth Iſraell, ſhall neither ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nor ſleepe.</hi> He will let no opportunity ſlip to releive. <hi>The</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 121. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Lord ſtandeth up to plead, and ſtandeth to judge the people, the Lord will enter into judgement with the Ancients of his people,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa 3. 13. 14. 15.</note> 
               <hi>and the Princes therof; for yee have eaten up the vineyards: the ſpoile of the poore is in your houſes: what meane yee that yee beate my people to peices, and grind the faces of the poore ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe footſteps of Gods glory: his pitty, omniſciency, all ſufficiency and watchfulnes doth evidence, that the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Gods people comes from no other but God. He is the God of their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>From this double ſalvation of the Church, wherof God is the Author, and therefore is ſtiled here the God of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: we learne. 1. To aſcribe both to him: 2. To ſeeke for both from him: and 3. To labour to have an intereſt in the ſalvation which he workes for his people.</p>
            <p>Firſt let us aſcribe all the ſalvation which is wrought, to God only. According to the title here given unto him, ſay as the Pſalmiſt. <hi>Not unto us oh Lord, not unto us, but to thy name give the glory.</hi> And this we ſhould do both in reſpect of the ſpirituall, and of the temporall ſalvation, whereof he makes us <note place="margin">Pſal. 115. 1.</note> partakers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to aſcribe our ſpirituall deliverance to God only. The foure beaſts and twenty foure elders, fell downe before the lambe, ſaying: <hi>Thou art worthy, for thou waſt ſlaine and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Revel. 5. 8. 9.</note> 
               <hi>haſt redeemed us to God by thy bloode out of every kindred, and tongue, and people and Nation, and haſt made us unto our God
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50293:18"/>
Kings and Preiſts, and we ſhall reigne on earth.</hi> All the glory of mans ſalvation is only to be aſcribed to God. He contrived the meanes of ſalvation by Chriſt, and he gave him to worke ſalvation, and to brin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his people to it: let him therefore have the glory of it. <hi>By grace</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we are ſaved:</hi> and <note place="margin">Ephe. 2. 5.</note> as if he had not ſaid enough, he addes: <hi>by grace yee are ſaved thorough faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God, not of workes leſt any ſhould boaſt.</hi> It was propheſied that when the temple ſhould be built by <hi>Zorobabell,</hi> the people of God ſhould with on joynt cry ſay: <hi>Grace to it: and he ſhall bring</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Zach 4 7.</note> 
               <hi>forth the head ſtone thereof with ſhouting, crying Grace, Grace to it.</hi> It was a type of Gods building his ſpirituall temples, by working grace in their hearts, and fitting them to be come holy temples, an habitation of God through the ſpirit. Indeed there <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 21. 22.</note> ſhall be mighty oppoſitions, many difficulties, mountaines to be removed. but the head ſtone ſhal be fetched out: Chriſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the builders once refuſed) ſhould be laid in the heart, and they ſhould all ſhout Grace, Grace to it. It is of free grace, that the worke is begunne, continued, and finiſhed: the Lord muſt therefore have the praiſe of our ſalvation. He brings ſalvation into the heart, he cauſes it to perſevere unto ſalvation: and he only will compleate our ſalvation: and therefore every gracious man muſt confeſſe that all of his ſalvation, is only from the God of his ſalvation. And ſo the Lord will count when he writes up the people, that this man was borne there, He will count that Chriſt was formed, and framed in the hearts of his <note place="margin">Pſal. 87. 6.</note> people, living in this or that Kingdome: the Lord keepes as it were a record, of all his glorious ſalvations, which he hath wrought in any, and he will be glorified by his people for it. The glorie then of our ſpirituall ſalvation is only to be aſcribed to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And ſo we muſt aſcribe only to him our temporall ſalvation. If he at any time doth deliver, or preſerve: let us ſay of this his ſalvation, as we did of the other: <hi>Not unto us oh Lord, not unto us, but to thy name give the glory.</hi> And with the Pſalmiſt: <hi>They got not (this or that deliverance) by their owne ſword: neither</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal 44. 3.</note> 
               <hi>did their right arme ſave them: but thy right hand, and thine arme, and the light of thy countenance, becauſe thou hadſt a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50293:19"/>
unto them.</hi> Say not it was the valour, and ſtrength, and wiſdome of ſuch and ſuch which hath done thus and thus for us: but acknowledge that God only was the Author, and the other his inſtruments of the mercies injoyed. <hi>Many a time</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 129. 1. 2</note> 
               <hi>from my youth up have they afflicted me,</hi> may <hi>England</hi> now ſay <hi>yea many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed againſt me: the plowers plowed on my back, and made long furrowes: but it was the righteous Lord that cut aſunder the cords of the wicked.</hi> It would be a great worke to relate the bare heades of the mercies which from day to day God vouchſafes to his people; every day brings out new mercies, new kindneſſes, new helps, new ſuccours, new eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capements, ſundry ſorts of deliverances in on kinde or other. <hi>England</hi> had long before this have bin as <hi>Sodom</hi> and as <hi>Gomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> unleſſe the Lord had ſaved her: let us therefore aſcribe her ſalvation unto God only: and when at any time the Lord ſaves any part of it, or our ſelves temporally: let this his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe lead us on to repentance. Let us looke to be partakers alſo of ſpirituall ſalvation, when he ſaves us temporally: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe his temporall ſalvation will prove, but a reſerving of us unto eternall deſtruction. Thus we ought to acknowledge that God indeede is the God of our ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Secondly. Seeing God is the God of our ſalvation, then let all of us learne whether we are to flie for any ſuccour in a time of neede: even unto this God, intitled the God of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus did <hi>David</hi> in every ſtraite, giving unto God ſuch <note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 1. 2</note> titles and names, which intimate, that God was all kinde of ſuccour unto him. And this we muſt do in our neede of either of theſe ſalvations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In our way ſpirituall to ſalvation. We deſire to be freed from many of our luſts, paſſions, and diſordered affections: for though perhaps God hath deſtroyed in his the dominion of ſinne, that it raignes not: yet much corruption remaines, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them under, from thriving in godlineſſe: and of this they would be rid: now in this caſe, we muſt do as Saint Paul did beſeech God againſt the meſſenger of Satan: <hi>ſeeke to him for ſalvation, yea for any ſalvation ſpirituall.</hi> If Satan tempt: it is God who muſt tread downe Satan under your feete ſhortly, <note place="margin">Rom. 16, 20.</note>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:50293:19"/>
Satan is ſtill a troubling, though a conquered enemy, ſeeking to eſpy all advantages: and therefore we muſt to God, who only inables us to reſiſt, that he may flie from us. On perhaps com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of an unruly, unbeleeving, yea dead heart: let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that it is God that quickens it, &amp; therfore ſeek to him reſolving not to ceaſe till he leave a bleſſing behind: the more unbeleeving, dead, dull, unruly melancholy, &amp; dejected you find the heart, be the more importunate, doubling, trebling, yea mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying ſuites: for God at length will heare and free thee from an evill heart of unbeleife. He hath the hearts of Kings in his hand, and can turne them: he only can change the heart, and for this he will be ſought, that ſuch a deliverance and ſalvation may be only aſcribed unto him. Another it may be is afraid, that he ſhall one day miſcarry, yeelding to the temptations which daily aſſaults him: one day he doubts he ſhall fall back, giving out from his Chriſtian profeſſion: let ſuch a man ſeeke to God, for he only eſtabliſheth, upholds, and ſtrengthens in grace: he only guides his ſervants, making them perſevere to the end, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he receives ſuch, ſo guided up to glory. Thus we ought to ſeeke only to him for any thing needefull unto our ſpirituall ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us only ſeeke unto him for any temporall deliverance or ſalvation. <hi>David, Aſa, Iehoſaphat, Hezekiah,</hi> yea all ſaints have done ſo, and ſo ought we to do, both for our ſelves, for others, and for the Churches of God. The Church needes much ſalvation: it was Davids prayer, and it ſhould be ours; <hi>Redeeme Iſraell oh God out of all his troubles:</hi> not from one but from <note place="margin">Pſal. 25. 22.</note> all: from its troubles from within, and from its troubles from without: yet ſeeke to God, call in his helpe, and his ſalvation unto her: <hi>Our helpe ſtandeth in the name of the Lord who hath made Heaven and Earth:</hi> let us depend on him for it, in a praying way: ſo the Prophet. <hi>Oh Lord be gracious to us: we have waited for thee, be thou their arme every morning, our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 33. 2.</note> 
               <hi>alſo in the time of trouble.</hi> The Church hath (bleſſed be God for it) many to fight for her; but unleſſe the Lord be their arme, every morning, ſtrengthning them to fight, all will for a certaine miſcarry: and though he do ſtrengthen, yet ſhe may come into trouble for all that: and then her duty is to pray
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50293:20"/>
that he may be her ſalvation in trouble. And thus God is to be ſought unto, as to the Captaine of his peoples ſalvation both ſpirituall, and temporall.</p>
            <p>Thirdly ſeeing God is the God of our ſalvation: let us his people labour to get aſſurance, that we have an intereſt, in the ſalvation which he workes. As his people have intereſt in him; ſo they have in his ſalvation. To get this aſſurance: let it be our care to have an intereſt in Ieſus, the Author of eternall ſalvation and the founder of all temporall deliverances: for all, and all manner of ſalvation is ratified, and confirmed to Gods people in Chriſt. We may be aſſured that we have intereſt in Chriſt, and in the ſalvation which he hath wrought.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we be loſt in our ſelves and ſenſible of our neede of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Chriſt was ſent to the loſt ſheepe, to ſuch who in their <note place="margin">Math. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>8. 11.</note> owne apprehenſions, are loſt, being not righteous in their owne eyes. He came to call ſinners to repentance: burdened ſinners, ſuch who call to Chriſt for helpe, leaſt they periſh: ſuch he will ſave: <hi>come unto me all yee that are weary, and heavy laden and I will refreſh you.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Math. 11. 29.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If we yeeld obedience to him, from whom we expect ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it is evident that then we have intereſt in Chriſt and his ſalvation. <hi>For Chriſt is the Author of ſalvation, to all them that obey him.</hi> A ſaviour he is to ſuch, to whom he is alſo a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne: <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 9.</note> for his ſaved people are ſaved to walke in holines. <note place="margin">I. Ephe. 1. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If we willingly heare and practiſe his word, it is a ſigne that we ſhall be ſaved: <hi>For God will have all to be ſaved, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tam. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>come to the knowledg of the truth, and ſalvation</hi> (ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt) <hi>is far from the wicked, becauſe they ſeeke not thy ſtat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>es, but I have longed for thy ſalvation, and thy law is my delight.</hi> Let <note place="margin">Pſal. 119 155.</note> us make Gods word our delight, and God will make good to us this his title, that he is unto us, the God of our ſalvation. And ſo much for the fourth obſervation,</p>
            <p>The fift is this. God is the confidence of all his people in all places.</p>
            <p>The confidence of the earth: of the ends of the earth, yea of all the ends of the earth: and as if that were not enough: he is the confidence of thoſe who are a farre of upon the ſea. The confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of thoſe on ſea, who are ſurrounded by ſea, of Ilanders:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50293:20"/>
and the confidence of thoſe on land, in all lands, of the whole continent. In handling this we will conſider. 1. How God can be called the confidence of all the world. 2. What this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is, which all his people every wher have. 3. Why God is their confidence: or what are their grounds of confiding in him. And 4. What uſe may be made of this title, given unto God: who is here called the confidence of all the world.</p>
            <p>Firſt how can God be called the confidence of all the world? This queſtion may well be asked, that the doubts, which it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords may be removed. For if by the ends of the earth, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the inhabitants of the earth: or the nations on it: people dwelling on the earth, and in the ſea: it will then be ſaid, that it doth not appeare that all theſe truſt and confide in God. There are many nations which know him not. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how is God ſaid to be the confidence of the ends of the earth.</p>
            <p>To this we muſt anſwer, according to a double acception of theſe words, <hi>the ends of the earth.</hi> They may be taken either collectively or elſe diſtributively.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we take theſe words collectively: for all nations in all places: then two things may be anſwered to the queſtion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though many nations as yet know not God, yet in thoſe nations there is ſufficient meanes given from God, to let them know that he only ſhould be their truſt and confidence. In all nations there are ſuch demonſtrations of Gods power, ſuch declarations of his goodnes, that he hath not left himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witnes, and that he only is to be depended on for all their good, and to be truſted, and confided in. Two ſcriptures proves this. <hi>We</hi> (ſaith Saint Paul) <hi>preach to you, that you ſhould turne to the living God, which made heaven and earth, and the ſea, and all things that are therein, who in times paſt ſuffered all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 14 15. 16. 17.</note> 
               <hi>to walke in their owne wayes, notwithſtanding he left not himſelfe without witneſſe; in that he did good, and gave us raine from heaven. And fruitfull ſeaſons, filling our hearts with food and gladneſſe.</hi> We ſee that God vouchſafed to all nations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon outward temporall mercies, that very heathens (if they would but obſerve and take notice of it) might thence have ſufficient proofe, and witneſſe that he only is to be truſted in.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50293:21"/>
And ſo likewiſe Gods ſeverity, and judgements in ſmiting na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (as yet not knowing him) theſe are proofes, that ſuch nations ought to know, that God only is to be confided in. <hi>The wrath of God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſſe, and unrighteouſneſſe of men, who hold</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18, 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>the truth in unrighteouſneſſe: becauſe that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it to them: for the inviſible things of him from the creation of the world are cleerely ſeene, being underſtood by the things which are made, even his eternall power and Godhead, ſo that they are without excuſe.</hi> So then, though many nations, do not actually make God their confidence, yet God hath witneſſed to them, that he is or ſhould be their onely truſt and confidence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though many nations do not as yet make God their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence: yet all nations ſhall one day do ſo; and ſo for the preſent it is prophetically true, that God is the confidence of all the ends of the earth. <hi>David</hi> in ſpirit foreſaw the great honour, and glory, which God ſhould have in all nations: and therefore he being a prophet, and knowing what God would do in theſe later dayes, he ſeeing this before, ſpake of the univerſall adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God in all nations, and of their taking him, for their only God, in a confidentiall repoſing themſelves on him. And becauſe of the certainty of the fulfillance of all this, in due time therefore <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes of it, as if it were already come to paſſe, and here he calleth God the confidence <hi>of all the ends of the earth, and of thoſe who are a farre off upon the ſea.</hi> This is not only implyed in this title here aſcribed to God; but <hi>David</hi> hath ſo much in another place. <hi>Aske of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 22. 27.</note> 
               <hi>earth for thy poſſeſſion:</hi> And againe. <hi>All the ends of the world</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 8.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall remember themſelves, and turne to the Lord, and all the kindred of the nations ſhall worſhip before him.</hi> And againe. <hi>He</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 72. 8. 11.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall have dominion from ſea to ſea, and from the river to the end of the earth, all Kings ſhall fall downe before him all nations ſhall ſerve him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take then the words as prophetically ſpoken: of the time when God ſhall by terrible things ſhake the nations, being the deſire of his people: and then it will appeare, that he hath bin

the Saviour of his: from all their troubles and oppreſſions: and then all nations will come in, and chooſe him for their God and Lord: one nation after another, till all have made him their confidence: and ſo in time theſe words ſhall be fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, that God is the confidence of all the world: of all the ends of the earth.</p>
            <p>If the words were handled in this ſenſe, according to this expoſition: they would affoord much inſtruction, touching the expectations, which we are to have of the converſion of the nations of the world: and concerning directions, to pray for it: that the arme of the Lord may be revealed to all people: according to that of <hi>David. God be mercifull unto us and bleſſe</hi>

               <hi>us, and cauſe his face to ſhine on us, that thy way may be known on earth, thy ſaving health among all nations.</hi> It is a bleſſing and mercy from God on his Church, that for the preſent it knows him: but it will be a new glimps of the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance on it, when the nations come thoroughly to underſtand and praiſe him aright with it, as their only confidence. We ſhould expect this, and pray for it; and deſire the Lord to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all impediments of it: which for the preſent are very great. <hi>For every valley muſt be filled, and every mountaine and</hi>

               <hi>hill muſt be brought low, the crooked muſt be made ſtraight, and the rough wayes made ſmooth.</hi> People of lower, and higher ranke in all places, muſt be filled with grace; after they are brought into a ſtate of humiliation: and whatſoever is crooked among them, muſt be made ſtraight, brought to the rule, be ſquared by the word: and the wayes which are rough, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive ſhall be ſmoothed: juſt offences, truly ſcrupling offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhall all be tooke away: and then after this all fleſh ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God: all nations ſhall then come to know that Chriſt is the Saviour, and ſalvation, which God hath ſet out to the world: <hi>There being no other name under heaven, by which</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts. 4. 12.</note> 
               <hi>men can ſaved.</hi> Theſe things might be proſecuted with much inſtruction, and comfort to all Gods people, but I chuſe to leave the Propheticall handling theſe words, to the ages to come, who ſhall experimentally finde the things (now ſpoken of) to be very true. Let it ſuffice us to know, that theſe words are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically true. God is the confidence of all nations, becauſe he
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50293:22"/>
will be ſo, when all nations ſhall come, to acknowledge him for their God. And ſo wee may ſafely underſtand the words col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively: which ſo underſtood, they are a full anſwer to the queſtion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we take the words diſtributively: for the ſeverall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes of the world in parts: and therein more particularly for the ſeverall inhabitants; for the particular perſons, dwelling in the earth, and on the ſea: yet then, the doubt remaines ſtill: How God can be ſaid to be the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence of every particular man in the earth. It ſeemes otherwiſe: experience teacheth us, that there are very few who truſt God and confide in him: how then is this true, that he is the confidence of the ends of the earth, and of thoſe on the ſea.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer. When it is ſaid that God is the confidence of the ends of the earth: we muſt not underſtand theſe words, of every particular individuall perſon, or nation: but of ſome in all places, of ſome in all nations: and ſo it is very true, that his owne people (where ever they be) make him their confidence. They truſt in him, relye on him, depend upon him. So that the meaning of theſe words <hi>(The confidence of the ends of the earth &amp;c.)</hi> is: Gods people in all the earth, and on the ſea: where ever they are, make God their confidence, though others do not. And ſo it propoſes to us this doctrine.</p>
            <p>God is every where the confidence of his people.</p>
            <p>I ſay of his people: of thoſe to whom he is the God of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of thoſe whom he anſwers: for whom he workes terrible things in the earth. This righteous holy people make God their confidence. And that God is the confidence of his people in all places, not only this ſcripture, but alſo others prove. <hi>Some</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt <hi>truſt in chariots, and ſome in horſes; but we will remember the name of the Lord our God.</hi> And from the text let <note place="margin">Pſal. 20. 7.</note> us take notice of the deſcription of this ſanctified conſiding peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 1. They are called <hi>the ends of the earth:</hi> the extremity of the earth, as if they were a people, ſhut up in a corner, a people dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the ends, or out skirts of the earth to ſerve God there. And moreover: 2. They are a people farre off on the ſea. A peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple expoſed to as great hazards and dangers, as can be imagined, <note place="margin">Toto diviſos <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rbe Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos, <hi>Virgil.</hi>
               </note> as if they were a people cut off from others by the ſea, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50293:22"/>
to be a <hi>people afflicted, and continually to be toſſed with waves and tempeſts.</hi> Yet this people in this condition as it were <note place="margin">Iſa. 54. 11.</note> an outcaſt driven to all inconveniencies of earth and ſea ſhall ſtill truſt in God: making him their confidence.</p>
            <p>I know (as I ſaid before) that this deſcription aimes princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, at the univerſality of the Church; which ſhall extend and ſpread it ſelfe, farre and neere in all places on the earth, to the utmoſt bounds both of ſea and land. But yet withall it will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this that I ſay, that though Gods people be a people, as it were ſhut out from the nations of the earth; not reckoned among them; though they were penned up in the utmoſt limits, not thought worthy to treade, and to live on the earth, and therefore contemned of all people, and expoſed to a thouſand miſcarriages and hard uſages: though they be toſſed in name, in eſtate, in their perſons: yet ſhall this godly people, this ſeede which ſerves the Lord: be accounted unto him for a generation. And they ſhall make the Lord their ſtay, and ſtaffe, their hope, and confidence. So ſaith the text, <hi>He is the confidence of all the ends of the earth,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 22. 30.</note> 
               <hi>and of all them that are a farre off upon the ſea:</hi> all his people every where, in all places, in all buſines, in all hazards, in all ſtraites, for all comforts do ſtill make the Lord their truſt and confidence. And thus the firſt thing, the queſtion purpoſed is reſolved, how God is ſaid to be the confidence of the ends of the earth &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly conſider what this confidence is which all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple every where make him: what doth it imply.</p>
            <p>The word here ſignifying truſt or confidence: is ſometimes put for an hopefull ſecurity. <hi>Ye ſhall do my ſtatutes and keepe my</hi>

               <hi>judgements and do them, and yee ſhall dwell in the land in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> that is in an hopefull confidentiall ſecurity. Now this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <note place="margin">Levit. 25. 8.</note> is nothing elſe, but a ſecure reſting on God, for all manner of ſuccour, and ſecurity in the good, and comfort which we would have. God is ſaid to be the confidence of his people in theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect that they hope for all good from him. Confidence is not only an expectation of the full fruition of himſelfe, as our portion; but alſo of all things elſe together with him, and of all things elſe which are good from him. <hi>The Lord is my portion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50293:23"/>
ſaith my ſoule, therefore will I hope in him.</hi> The ſoule lookes on all its good, and comfort in heaven and earth, as from the Lord <note place="margin">Lamen. 3. 24.</note> who is its portion: and as to be ſupplied from him, as out of its portion. It expects from him life; and health, and outward comforts, friends, good name, foode, rayment, yea every thing: if theſe faile; it lookes to be ſupplied from the Lord, its portion; yea and for all its good ſpirituall, temporall and eternall. Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the pardon of ſinne, and things ſpirituall and heavenly, but likewiſe protection, proviſion, and things earthly, are hoped for from God. <hi>Whom have I</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>in heaven but thee and in earth there is none that I require beſides thee.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 25.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. God is ſaid to be the confidence of his people in reſpect of their ſecure relying on him for ſecurity, and ſafety, and repulſing all evill from them. <hi>David</hi> to ſhew that he relied on him for all manner of ſafety, calls him, <hi>his rock, his for treſſo his buckler, the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 1. 2</note> 
               <hi>horne of his ſalvation, and his high tower.</hi> God was a rocke to him, in the ſeas and waves of his trouble, when afflictions like billowes came thick and threefold, he broke them, and ſecured him as on a rock. And God was a fortreſſe to him in a ſiege, a a ſheild againſt a ſtorme of darts: a ſhelter againſt a ſtorme of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences: an horne of ſalvation to puſh away adverſaries, and an high tower where he was ſafe. Making God our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is a ſecure relying on him for ſafety, and ſecurity againſt all the evill, which is feared, or which hath ſeiſed on us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God is ſaid to be his peoples confidence, in reſpect of their recumbency and dependency on him, in all buſineſſes, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments thorough which they goe in this life. A contented acquieſcence reſting on God: relying on him, for the bringing to paſſe (according to his will) what we have to doe, is a true making God our confidence. So <hi>David, Commit thy way unto the Lord, truſt alſo in him, and he ſhall bring it to paſſe.</hi> And ſo <note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Solomon, Truſt in the Lord, with all thine heart, and lean not to rhine owne underſtanding, in all thy waies acknowledge him, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>hee will direct thy paths.</hi> Now this confidentiall truſting to God, in all that we have to doe, is ſeen moſt eminently in one of theſe three particular acts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When men make God their confidence, though they have moſt apparent meanes of effecting, or working what they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50293:23"/>
yet they will not relie on thoſe meanes, but on God &amp; his bleſſing upon it. So the <hi>Pſalmiſt, I will not truſt in my bow, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 44. 6.</note> 
               <hi>ſhal my ſword ſave me, but thou haſt ſaved us from our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and haſt put them to ſhame that hated us.</hi> And ſo men make God their confidence, when though they have happy ſucceſſe in their undertakings, yet looke through all on God, as the donor and giver of it, and as the worker of all their workes for them and in them. A man who though he hath bread, and ſits downe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; yet knowing that he is not fed by bread alone, but by Gods bleſſing, by the word that proceedeth out of Gods mouth, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he truſts in God: and though he watcheth and buildeth, yet ſtill he lookes to God, acknowledging that <hi>except the Lord keepe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 127. 1. 2</note> 
               <hi>the city, the watchmen waketh but in vaine:</hi> and except the Lord build the houſe, he labours in vain who buildeth it: and if he plow and tills his ground, yet confeſſes that it is God who gives him knowledge unto it, and that bleſſeth his labours: and therefore whileſt he is about his ordinary imployments, yet he hopes and truſts in God, even in plowing there is hope: the man who doth thus; is one undoubtedly, who maketh God his confidence, and ſo alſo this is ſeene.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When men make God their confidence, though they have no apparent meanes of effecting what they are about or intend. <hi>Gideon</hi> ſaw no way wherby God would give deliverance by him, from the <hi>Midianites,</hi> yet he truſted on God, and relyed on him. <hi>David</hi> going out againſt the <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> onely with a ſtaffe and a ſling, yet truſted in God. <hi>The Lord that kept me out of the paw of the Lion, and out of the paw of the Beare, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philiſtine.</hi> The Apoſtles and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <note place="margin">1 Sam. 17. 37</note> which went on Chriſts meſſage without money, and change of raiment, yet truſted on God for proviſion and lacked nothing. And ſo when men truſt on God, for a bleſſing on their callings &amp; labour, though they ſee no likelihood of their thriving therin: and ſo when a man (in the uſe of ſpirituall meanes) ſtill truſts God, he will make uſe of the ordinances, he is attentive to the word, he reades, meditates, prayes, comes to the Sacrament, and it may be he finds little comfort in all, his ſoule is nothing more quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor at all ſetled by them: and yet out of conſcience to Gods commandements he uſeth theſe, depending not on them, but
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50293:24"/>
truſting to God, that at laſt he ſhall have comfort, ſettlement and peace by them, though for the preſent he find none.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When a man hath all meanes in appearance contrary to him: every thing ſeemes to work againſt him, yet he doth put his truſt in God, that God will ſtill make good his promiſe, ſhewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe gracious, and being ſtill the preſerver of his people. This is truſting in God, and making him our confidence, here beyond all hope, is a beleeving in hope, againſt hope, againſt all that is ſeene. Thus when a man ſeeth all the world band together againſt the Church: when <hi>Kings, Rulers, Nobles,</hi> great mighty, powerful, <note place="margin">Pſal. 2 1.</note> wiſe, and ſubtill ones, yea people of all ſorts, combine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to root out Chriſtian profeſſion, and to bring a licentious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertiniſme, and Atheiſme, into the world: when he ſhall ſee the Church in diſtreſſes, and perplexities, as it were beſieged on all ſides; yet then to truſt in God, and to bee able to ſee as <hi>Eliſha,</hi> moe for the Church, then againſt it, this is a making God our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, it is a relying and truſting on him. So when in great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury, in the want of food and ſuſtenance, one yet relies on God, it is a great degree of confidence. Thus <hi>Eliah</hi> truſted to God for his feeding by Ravens, and afterward for his food from the meale in the barrell, and the oyle in the widdowes cruſe. It was a great degree of confidence in the Prophet <hi>Habbakuk: that though the fig-tree ſhould not bloſſome, nor fruit ſhould be in the vine,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hab. 3. 17. 18.</note> 
               <hi>the labour of the Olive ſhould faile, and the field ſhould yeeld no meate: the flocks ſhould bee cut off from the fold, and there ſhould be no herd in the ſtalls, yet</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>he would rejoyce in the Lord, and would joy in the God of his ſalvation.</hi> It is an high degree of confidence, ſtill to rely on God in the want of means and ſo it is to relie on him in the contrariety of meanes, ſo <hi>David</hi> truſted in God, when he ſeemed to be abandoned of all: <hi>if he hath a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to me</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I ſhall ſee both the Arke and this place.</hi> And <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 25.</note> ſo in ſpiritualls, when all ſeemes contrary, yet then truſt in God, the Law perhaps thunders out death, againſt the ſoule of a poore ſinner; the Goſpell yeelds no comfort: godly conference addes nothing, holy exerciſes leaves him ſtill, as it found him comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and troubled, yea perhaps more troubled, becauſe we have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them; yet it ſtill doth truſt in God, looking beyond ſenſe, peeping within the vaile, and perceiving that God will at laſt,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50293:24"/>
ſpeake peace, and though hee ſlay, yet (with <hi>Iob)</hi> it will ſtill truſt in him: this is a very great exaltation of God, and making him our confidence.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many like caſes may be ours, when the meanes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to do us good ſeeme to worke contrary, and yet in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion they will do us good: it is our duety (how ever they worke) to truſt to God, making him our confidence. A man having a faithfull freind, whom he knowes to be truſty, and reall in any thing, which he undertakes for him, though he perceives that things go untowardly croſſe, in his freinds managing ſome affaires for him, yet he relyes on him, and is confident, that he will do all to his advantage at the laſt: or as when a man hath a faithfull counſeller to follow his cauſe, and plead it: he ſees per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps his counſeller much croſſed, and thwarted: yet knowing him to be cordiall and wiſe, and ſollicitous in his undertaking, and very carefull to take any occaſion, and to make uſe of any thing offered to promote his good: he will depend on him, for ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his cauſe to the utmoſt: ſuch a thing is our truſting in God, though in a farre more eminent way: we truſt him as a freind, to manage all for us: and though we apprehend that things prove otherwiſe, then wee expected; yet wee ſtill depend on God; knowing that he will at laſt cauſe all things to work for our beſt. We truſt him alſo as our counſellour who will thoroughly plead the cauſe of his people: and though they ſeeme a while to ſuffer yet he will at laſt give peace to the land, and diſquiet the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants <note place="margin">Ier. 50. 34.</note> of Babylon.</p>
            <p>In theſe reſpects God is ſaid to be the confidence of his people in all places.</p>
            <p>Thirdly the reaſons or grounds why Gods people ſo confide in him: or why God is thus their confidence, are theſe two, to name no more..</p>
            <p n="1">1. His people in all places, in all eſtates, in all conditions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to glorifie him above all: and this they do moſt by confiding and truſting in him. For.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They glorifie his providence: while they thus rely, depend, and ſtay themſelves on him. Their truſting in him ſheweth, that they are a people at his diſpoſall, to do with them as he ſees fit: either to bring them into ſtraites, or to inlarge them: to make
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50293:25"/>
them veſſells of honour, and comfort: or to be made broken veſſells, a people for miſery and deſtruction. This truſting in God exceedingly gloryfies his providence, and ſoveraignty over them, Confidence in him, is a gracious ſubmiſſion to be ordered, and deſpoſed of, as he ſees fit. It is a yeelding, that he may be glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thorough us, whether he breake us, or build us, wound us, or heale us, ſave us, or deſtroy us, make us glorious or miſerable. Confidence in him ever implyes in it an humble acknowledgment that we are but as clay in the hands of the potter: to be diſpoſed of, as will beſt ſute with his glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Confidence in God giveth unto him the glory of his truth: or the glory of his promiſes: it manifeſts our acknowledging of his faithfulneſſe, and our depending upon the word of his truth. It is a great glory to God, that we account him faithfull, a God keeping promiſe with his people, and this is done, when we confide in him. <hi>David</hi> prayed <hi>Let thy mercy come alſo unto me, oh Lord even thy ſalvation, according to thy word:</hi> and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 41.</note> 
               <hi>that his ſoule fainteth for his ſalvation, but I hope</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in thy word.</hi> And againe: <hi>uphold me according to thy word,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">verſ. 81.</note> 
               <hi>that I may live, and let me not bee aſhamed of my hope.</hi> Thus God hath the glory of his truth: when we confide in him. <note place="margin">verſ 116.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Confidence in God gives him the glory of his goodneſſe, it is a reall acknowledgement, that the Lord is good, and doth good, and that we therefore depend upon him, as children do on their <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 68.</note> parents for all our maintenance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This our confidence in God, giveth unto him the glory of his Godhead. Wee then gloriſie him, when we make him the maſter of our affections: as when we love, and feare and joy in him and the like: but when we hope and confide in God, we then gloryfie him above the glory, which we give unto him by our other affections. For though in them all the principall ſtream runs to Godward; yet there are rivelets and by currants of theſe affections, permitted to runne to other things. As for example: we love God, and gloryfie him by our love, when he only and cheifely is loved by us: but yet our love alſo runnes out to other things: to his children for his ſake: and to our neighbours: and to men: and to other things ſubordinately. And ſo we gloryfie God, when he is primely and principally our feare and dread:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50293:25"/>
but yet he alloweth us to feare the magiſtrates who beare the image of his majeſty, and to feare our parents, and to feare and reverence others. And ſo we gloryfie him when he is cheifely and principally our delight, and joy, and when our ſoules cheare up themſelves in his word: but yet he alloweth us to joy in other things: we may joy and delight in his ſaints, on the earth: and in outward mercies, bleſſings and deliverances: we may take pleaſure in the creatures moderately. I might ſpeake the like of all other affections. But now in confiding and hoping in God we only gloryfie him. The whole ſtreame of our hope is to runne to Godward, and to him only. When we make him our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, we truſt not in any thing elſe, but ſurrendring up to him all our hopes, we then make him fully, and wholy our God: and we thereby give him the ſole intereſt and command in our affections: and ſo we hereby gloryfie him. Thus the people of God being every way deſirous to do ſo, they therefore make him their confidence: for confiding in him honoreth him as God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Gods people make him their confidence: becauſe they ſee in God an all ſufficiency, to ſupply their defects, to comfort them <note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> in diſtreſſes, to releive them in their wants, and to furniſh them with all things, which they can deſire and would have. The ſight of this alſufficiency in God, to do all this, is wrought in them, from one, or from all theſe conſiderations which are the ground of hope and confidence, as.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They know that God himſelfe is very powerfull, able to helpe and ſave, and therfore they confide in him, they know that he is able to give all what they need, both in ſpirituals and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls. He made and framed all, and all is at his diſpoſall; and he can diſpoſe of all for their good. This the Prophet acknowledges that he made heaven, and gives rain, and ſhowers, and every comfort. <note place="margin">Ier. 14. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Art not thou he oh Lord our God, therfore we will waite on thee, Lord thou haſt made all theſe things.</hi> Gods people know that he hath power to ſave, &amp; deliver them, out of trouble, and yet though he do not, they wil truſt in him, becauſe he can do it and none elſe. <hi>Shadrach Meſeck</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> ſaid ſo, <hi>Our God whom we ſerve</hi>

            <p n="2">2. His people know that Gods only care provides for them and all the world, ſeeing he hath taken on him the care of all things. <hi>The eyes of all waite on thee, and thou giveſt them their meate in due ſeaſon, thou openeſt thy hand, and ſatiſfies the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of every living thing:</hi> and therefore they make him their <note place="margin">Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

God takes care for oxen, much more for his ſervants, he hath (beſides his generall care, in providing for all creatures) a ſpeciall care over thoſe of his owne family. He himſelfe tells ſome men, that they are worſe then infidells, becauſe they provide not for their owne: he himſelfe therefore will both thinke on, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 8.</note> his owne, in due time, he provides both for their bodies, and for their ſoules: and he who gives to the body now a few crummes, will never deny unto the ſoule the crown prepared for it. When Gods people do ſeriouſly thinke on this, they ſee that they have juſt ground to confide and truſt in God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Gods people know, that he is ſo powerfull, that though for our good he often imploys inſtruments, and creatures, or ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary cauſes, beſtowing on them ſtrength, and ability, to worke for their good; yet that theſe can worke nothing except he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with them: they are without his concurrance like broken ciſternes, or as the brookes of <hi>Tema,</hi> affoording no comfort, but ſoone dryed up. The Lord can do with them, as he did with the Aegyptian chariots, if he take off the wheeles they ſtand. The Apoſtle tells us, that in him we live, and move, and have our being: the Saints conſidering this, make God their confidence. <note place="margin">Acts. 17. 18.</note> Not any creature can hurt or helpe, unleſſe God concurre. A ſword may be drawen and ſtrike, but it wounds not, unleſſe God doth give it a commiſſion, and put ſtrength into it. The Pſalmiſt tells us, that God turnes the edge of the ſword. It may
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50293:26"/>
ſmite but if God blunts its edge, there will be no harme. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing likewiſe helpes without him, cloathes could not warme, <note place="margin">Pſal. 89. 43.</note> freinds could not helpe, or workes could not proſpet, unleſſe the Lord give a bleſſing. <hi>Conſider your wayes ſaith the Lord, yee have ſowne much, and bring in little, yee cate, but yee have not enough, yee drinke, but yee are not filled with drinke, yee</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hag. 1. 5. 6.</note>

               <note place="margin">Ver. 9. 10.</note> 
               <hi>I did blow upon it. The heavens over you is ſtayed from dew, and the earth is ſtayed from her fruits.</hi> Creatures are no further be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to us, then it pleaſes God to concurre. Paul plants, Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los waters, but yet God gives the increaſe. The Saints knowing this, do therefore ſee, that they have a ſufficient ground, to make God their confidence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Gods people know, that he is able to do alone whatſoever any ſecondary cauſe doth. God can do that thing, either with it or without it. And this makes them confide in God only. The ſtreames depends on the fountaine, but the fountaine it ſelfe can ſend out its waters, ſome other way, by ſome other channells. The creatures depends on God, the great creatour, and if he but ſpeake a word, it is done, what he wills, he can worke without his creatures, for his people, and will do ſo, if he ſee cauſe: and therefore his people ſee reaſon, to confide in him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Gods people know that he hath ingaged himſelfe by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to thoſe that truſt in him, he is their father, and careth for them: and though a parent forſake their child, yet he will not his people. <hi>When my father and my mother forſake me, then the</hi>

He can turne a wilderneſſe into a fruitefull feild. Though your hearts ſhould be naughty, unbelieving, miſgiving: yet hope in Gods promiſes: conſider his infinite ability and his undoubted fidelity, in keeping promiſe with his ſervants, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but truſt in him, and make him your confidence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:50293:27"/>
Upon theſe grounds, or for theſe reaſons, Gods people make him their confidence.</p>
            <p>Fourthly: this title that God is the confidence of all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhould make us trie our ſelves, whether we are ſuch, to whom he is the only confidence. And here we will ſhew. 1. Such ſignes whereby every one good, and bad, may know it: and 2. Such whereby they who are truely Gods people, may certainly finde that they do ſo, in ſome peculiar acts or other.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The trialls whereby every on may gueſſe at their owne condition, in this reſpect are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He who truely maketh God his confidence, will above all things deſire Gods favour: and will part with any thing for it. No man would be pulled from the hornes of the Altar, which while he holdes, he is in ſafety: we cannot perſwade a company of naked men to forſake the fort, wherein they are ſafe, and to commit themſelves to the open feild; they will deſire to keepe where they have confidence: thus the man who maketh God his confidence will do any thing for him, and part with any thing for his favour. <hi>Moſes</hi> forſakes all the treaſures in Aegypt, and the glory in it for God. It is a ſigne that a man maketh God his confidence, when he renounces his ſinnes and luſts; and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be diſgraced, nicknamed, and to ſuffer the loſſe of all things gladly for God. It is ſigne that he ſeeth more in God, then others, and more in God then he can loſe, he findes that Chriſt is all in all. But ſurely they as yet have not made God their confidence, who ſell God for the world, as <hi>Demas;</hi> Chriſt or the cauſe of Chriſt for gaine, as did <hi>Judas:</hi> who are content to let goſpell, conſcience, goodneſſe, and all go, ſo they can there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by pleaſe ſuch, on whom they depend. They never truſted God, who prizes their ſinnes, luſts, and ſinnefull pleaſures before him: neither will they make him their confidence, if troubles ſhould come.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He truely maketh God his confidence, who maketh him an univerſall confidence, and truſteth in him in all things, and for all things, He comitteth his whole wayes to him: his whole perſon, his whole buſineſſe, his whole managing, he truſts in him in all places, at all times, in health, and ſicknes, for proviſion and protection, in times of trouble, and any danger, for Children, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50293:27"/>
for a bleſſing in every thing. He truſts on him, for earth as well as for heaven, for grace: as well as for glory. But that man hath not made God his confidence, who doth not truſt him in all things. Some will not truſt him with their temporalls: they dare not beleive in him to provide for them, and theirs after them: they depend not on him, for their outward eſtate, others will truſt him for temporalls, but not for ſpiritualls; they are loth to reſt on him only, for full ſalvation, and pardon. They would have ſomething of their owne to juſtifie them before God: And this is all the trouble of many: but God will be the ſole confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his people: truſt in him, for with him there is plentifull redemption. He who truſts in God will make him his univerſall confidence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He who makes God his confidence will be induſtrious in the uſe of the meanes which brings a bleſſing on him, and which God hath appointed. Thus he who confides in God for ſalvation, will diligently ſearch after the means of ſalvation, hearkning and liſtning after the word of ſalvation, he who confides in him for wordly things, will be induſtrious in an honeſt calling. They truſt not God, who ſit ſtill, nor they, who ſet themſelves into no good way. He truſts not God for ſalvation, who ſaith, if God hath predeſtinated me to life, I ſhall be ſaved, though I betake my ſelfe into no ſuch wayes, as the Preacher ſpeakes of: he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders not, that God hath predeſtinated as well to the meanes, as to the end, and to the end, by the meanes: and that he ſaves only ſuch, who betake them to his appointed meanes. It is a deluſion to thinke to come to heaven, without walking in the way to it: it is as if men expected to reape an harveſt, and yet never ſowed a graine of ſeede. So likewiſe he never truſts God, for outwards who doth not apply himſelfe, to an induſtrious way of obteining them, why looke yee (ſaid <hi>Jacob</hi> to his ſonnes) <hi>one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I have heard that there is corne in</hi> Aegypt, <hi>get yee downe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 42. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>thither and buy for us from thence.</hi> A confidentiall man will be induſtrious in the uſe of meanes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He who makes God his confidence, will not put forth his hands unto unlawfull means, for his helpe. <hi>David</hi> relied on God for the Kingdome of <hi>Saul,</hi> but would not uſe unlawfull meanes <note place="margin">1. Sam. 26. 10.</note> to obteine it. Such never truſted God, who reſolve to ſteale,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50293:28"/>
oppreſſe, defraud, lie and flatter, and uſe wicked meanes to gain a penny. They truſt not God, who take a penſion from <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> Nor they, who (when they miſſe a thing, or when any thing is amiſſe with them) will conſult with witches and wizards, as once <hi>Saul</hi> did with the witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> and <hi>Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi> ſent to the God of <hi>Eknon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. He who makes God his confidence, will be undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in any condition. Confidence in God makes the heart invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible. It is true: an holy confiding man when evill comes, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſee it; and be thereof ſenſible, and troubled at it: <hi>but though he be troubled on all ſides</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) <hi>yet he is not in deſpaire:</hi> though he be ſometimes afraid, yet with <note place="margin">Pſal. 17. 3.</note> 
               <hi>David</hi> he can ſay, <hi>in this will I be confident:</hi> in this he is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that God is his refuge, his preſent helpe in trouble, his preſerver from the hurt of evill. <hi>Though I walke</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) thorow the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will feare no evill for</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 23. 4.</note> 
               <hi>thou art with me.</hi> He may ſuſpect his confidence; whoſe heart in troubles is wholy ſpiritles, and comfortles, drooping and dwining away, as <hi>Naballs</hi> did: he may feare, he is not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to commit freely his ſoule into the hands of God, who is a faithfull creatour. The confiding man will not be heartleſſe, though an univerſall death and deſolation befall the land; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knowes that by death he ſhall be tranſlated hence to ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord. <hi>I had fainted</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) unleſſe I had beleived to ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord in the land of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 27. 13.</note> 
               <hi>the living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus every one good and bad may try whether they have made the Lord their confidence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are alſo ſome ſignes which may helpe all Gods truly faithfull people, to gaine aſſurance, that they have undoubtedly made him their confidence. Many of thoſe (I know) complain of unbeleeving and deſpairing hearts, that they cannot confide and truſt in God as they ſhould. To whom for comfort, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that true beleevers may know that they have really made God their confidence, if ever the Lord pleaſe to bring them to one of theſe temptations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When the promiſes made by God, ſeeme to be delayed, and there is no appearance of their fulfillance: then all ſuch who have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50293:28"/>
not made God their confidence will ceaſe expecting and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the word of promiſe, like that prophane man: <hi>this evill is of the Lord, what ſhould I waite for the Lord any longer.</hi> But <note place="margin">1 King. 6. 33.</note> if notwithſtanding Gods delayes: the heart keepe ſtill to the word of truth; and is ſtill confident that in time it will be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, it undoubtedly is then an heart confiding in God. A wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting heart is a confiding heart. So the Prophet: <hi>I will waite on</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 8. 17.</note> 
               <hi>the Lord, and looke upon him.</hi> A Merchant who reſts on his factor, for the returne of ſome commodity, which he promiſed, finding that his factour deferres, yet will account him faithfull, knowing that he on weightier conſiderations, for his Maſters greater profit, uſes not to returne commodities ſo ſoone as he expected. So the ſoule (which reſts on God, for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch and ſuch promiſes) will yet wait on him as faithful, though they be not preſently, or ſo ſoone performed, as wee deſire: becauſe it is perſwaded that God delayes for ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage to the ſoule: to humble it, or to exalt it more; or to make his bleſſings more acceptable when they come. A ſoule confiding in the delay and unlikelines of the performance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that God can and will fulfill his word, when it ſhall be for the beſt, is a ſoule which hath made God its confidence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Lord ſuffers you to be mocked by prophane men: if at any time they aske, wher is the promiſe of his comming, and <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 3.</note> what advantage hath piety in theſe times: can your God ſave you out of the hands of murthering, deſtroying men, will you ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine your integrity: do not the moſt religious ſuffer, as much, if not worſe then others: Now at this time, if notwithſtanding all theſe ſcornes, and diſheartnings, you are willing ſtill to keepe cloſe to God, and to paſſe through good report, and evill report, and are content to be yet more vile, before theſe men, for Gods ſake; and in Gods cauſe: you have undoubtedly made God your confidence: Gods people thus proved that they had done ſo, as it is in the <hi>Pſalmes: All this is come upon us, yet have we not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 44. 17.</note> 
               <hi>forgotten thee: neither have we dealt falſely in thy Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If ever the Lord bring you into a ſtate, that he ſeemes to be an enemy, by viſiting the ſoule, wounding the ſpirit, giving it as it were a ſight of hell, as if he would have no mercy: yet in this caſe, you ſhall know, that ye have made God your confidence
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50293:29"/>
if you ſtill will waite on God, boldly and truſtingly reaſoning with him, as the Pſalmiſt did: <hi>hath God forgotten to be gracious will he ſhut up his loving kindneſſe in diſpleaſure.</hi> A ſoule in the <note place="margin">Pſal. 77. 9.</note> lack of mercy: being willing to ſtay it ſelfe on God, becauſe he will ſhew mercy: being reſolved however; to dye at the foote of majeſty, to be cruſht by his ſcepter: this is a ſoul which confides in God. And the Lord who knowes the anguiſh, and diſtreſſe of this confiding ſpirit, will heale, and reſtore it, to ſtrength, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. It ſhall be eſtabliſhed, when all the careles ones of the world, ſhall be terribly ſhaken, and ſhattered, in all their hopes. Conſider what the Prophet writes. <hi>Why ſayeſt thou, O Jacob, and ſpeakeſt O Iſraell, my way is hid from the Lord, and my judgement is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over from my God &amp;c. He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might, he increaſeth ſtrength: even the youths ſhall faint and be weary, and the young men ſhall utterly fall: but</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 40. 27, 29. 30. 31.</note> 
               <hi>they that waite upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength they ſhall mount up with winges as Eagles, they ſhall runne, and not be weary, and they ſhall walke and not be faint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus may every one try, and experimentally find, whither God is to them, as he is to others, the only confidence. <hi>For he is</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt <hi>the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of thoſe who are a farre off upon the ſea.</hi> Let us therfore of theſe weſterne ends of the earth, be ſtill confident, though we ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but things terrible: becauſe by theſe the Lord worketh his Churches deliverance; manifeſts his owne righteouſneſſe: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth his peoples deſires, and expectations, and declareth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be the God of all his ſervants ſalvation; and therefore worthy to be made the confidence of them all farre and neere, by land and ſea, in all places.</p>
