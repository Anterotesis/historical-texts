         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Declaration of Capt. ALEXANDER CHARTERS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Chriſtian people, God, in his wiſe providence, hath thought fit to make me an example of publick juſtice a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this time, that all thoſe who have not fallen, may be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and confirmed in the way of truth, and others who have bin, and are going on in thoſe wicked courſes, for the which now I am puniſhed, may be reclaimed, which is that my ſoul doth deſire, and ſhall pray the Lord to open the eyes of their underſtanding, that they may ſee the fearfull guiltineſſe lies upon their ſouls, and the wrath of God hanging above their heads for the ſame, that ſo by ſincere and ſpeedy repentance they may turn unto the Lord, that the riches of his free grace may be evidenced in their converſion, that they may all be made partakers of that eternall life, which I truſt through the merits of my Redeemer to be made partaker of, when this naturall life that I have now to lay down ſhall be taken from me; And truly, I cannot enough magnifie Gods free love unto me, that he did not deſtroy me when I was in the height and heat of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courſe, ſighting againſt his cauſe, but hath reſerved me unto this time, that the glory of his free love might be ſo much the more magnified and extolled: Which cauſe he hath ſo truly owned to be his own by ſo many evident and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable arguments, that I dare ſay the greateſt enemy and oppoſer of the ſame, if he ſpeak in conſcience, and not wilfully blind fold his eyes, will ſay as much. For look back to the beginning of theſe troubles, and you ſhall clearly perceive that what ever was plotted or contrived againſt the Lords people or his cauſe in this land, turned directly to the ſhame of the contrivers and plotters, and how the Lord hath rewarded the prime oppoſers, both Church-men and great Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titians, to a great many of you is very well knowne. Secondly, look upon the prime undertakers imployed againſt this work (I am bound in all charity, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that our late Soveraign from whom they did purchaſe commiſſion, is now with the Lord) were men more regarding their own private intereſt, then the glory of God, or the Kings intereſt, which they had ſo much in their mouthes; as was ſeen by the conſequence in joyning with, and giving Commiſſions to perſons deſperately ſworne enemies and oppoſers to the true Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and how thoſe men ſhould have advanced the ſame, or been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to our King, profeſſing the ſaid Religion, I leave it to all indifferent religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and rationall men to judge. And though the Lord ſuffered the Rod of thoſe wicked men to lye upon the back of the righteous for a time, and that they did ſhed the blood of Gods people like water, and made the fields and cities of this land to ſwimme there with, yet at laſt how the Lord did over take thoſe bloody Iriſhes, Papiſts, and others with his vengeance, and of late the prime underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, is not unknown to you all; For the which this land hath how reaſon to rejoyce in the Lord, that the ſtrength of the wicked and malignant party is how broken, and all their plots and machinations fully diſcovered: And the ſame
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58071:3"/>
Lord that hath delivered you from fear of the enemies within, will likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you from the great threatnings of the inſulting enemies of the neighbour lands, If you prove thankfull for this mercy and deliverance you have received, and keep cloſe with God by adhering couragiouſly to his cauſe and Covenant. I ſhall now crave pardon to ſpeak a word concerning our now gracious King, whom I pray God bleſſe with length of dayes, and put the wicked from about him, that his throne may be eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe: And it is thus, that what Commiſſions have been granted by him, (nay I may rather ſay, extorted) againſt this nation, that the Subjects of this Kingdom may not conceive preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt him for the ſame, or think, that of his naturall diſpoſition he inclin'd to that courſe he was led upon, or that in any way he had, or hath thoughts againſt the good of Religion; No, God forbid you ſhould thus think, but impute it rather to the cunning and malice of thoſe who purchaſed them, and to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturity of his years, who at that time was too flexible to their counſels, For I dare boldly ſay, and am very hopefull, that if the Lord put faithfull counſellors about him, he ſhall prove as gracious a King as ever ruled this Nation: You will pardon this my digreſſion, I will now return to what concerns my ſelfe and preſent condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good People,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee me here ready to lay down my life by a juſt ſentence of Parliament, I am an object for Gods mercy and your prayers, The ſentence for which I am now to receive this publick puniſhment, was given forth againſt me, for joyning with thoſe deſperately wicked enemies to Religion, of the which I was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt now; for the which I doe not only ſtand guilty of temporall death by the law of this land; but alſo of the eternal wrath of God, without his free mercy in Chriſt Jeſus my Redeemer, if I ſhould be rewarded according to the merit of my offence; For how fearfull a guiltineſſe lies upon my conſcience (I will now gloriſie God by a confeſſion, though I ſhould bring ſhame upon my ſelfe) I ſhall now declare, that all thoſe that hear me, may pray to the Lord to pardon this my publick guiltineſſe, and all other my perſonall faults and offences which are paſt number, yet the Lords mercy is above all his works, and through the blood of the New Covenant, I hope all thoſe my ſins ſhall be purged and waſhed away.</p>
            <p>When this land did firſt enter into Covenant with God, <hi>Anno,</hi> 1638. I did ſwear and ſubſcribe the ſame, and did engage perſonally in the ſervice in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the firſt year; But what a fearfull defection I made, by joyning afterward with the enemies of the doctrine and diſcipline, which I ſwore by that Covenant to maintain, and the breaking of my vows to God for perſonall Reformation, which I was likewiſe ſworne unto, it is known to God and my own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and not unknown to ſome here preſent. And truly I muſt ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and that with a ſorrowfull heart, that in all the courſes I have been upon ever ſince, in oppoſition to that Covenant, there was ever reluctancy within, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58071:3"/>
ſome light of conſcience checking me, which I bore down, and ſmothered by ſetting before my eyes worldly reſpects, as favour of Princes, and great men, and (that enemy to my ſalvation) the point of honour, never to relinquiſh a cauſe though never ſo bad; for which I do now acknowledge my unfeigned ſorrow and repentance, and begs pardon at the Throne of Grace for this my guiltineſſe.</p>
            <p>And now I come to make known unto you, how Satan dealt with me when he drew me to this Apoſtacy, and ſhall deſire if there be any that are now my hearers, who are or have been covenant-breakers, may examine themſelves, if the like way Satan hath uſed with them, that ſo they may repent, and thoſe that have not falle<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, may ſtand faſt and be watchfull by my example, to avoyd ſuch ſnares: And firſt before I made publick defection from the cauſe, Sathan got in upon me by ſeducing me to perſonall vices, in particular, drunkenneſſe, and all other vices acompanying that, as whoredome, ſwearing, prophane and filthy communication, lying, brawling and quarrelling, abuſe of the creatures, nay in a word, from a rationall creature to become worſe then a beaſt; of all which vices and many more, occaſioned by that ſin, my ſoul is now guilty. Thus having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to grow diſſolute and prophane in my life, by giving my ſelfe over to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all manner of wickedneſſe with wantonneſſe and greedineſſe, ſin became ſo cuſtomary, as the conſcience thereof was quite gone, I became careleſſe of all religious duties, by prophaning the Sabbath, neglecting all the publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Gods worſhip, as receiving the Sacrament, hearing of Sermons, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or private prayer, nay in a word, I became a contemner of the Goſpell, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſer of Gods ſervants, and a mocker of all that made conſcience of religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or walking ſtrictly before God, ſo that Religion became a thing ſo indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent unto me, that I could, and did goe as frequently and more to Maſſe, and to Idolatrous Churches, as to the reformed, when I was beyond the Sea; And at my return to <hi>England,</hi> for Common Prayer I made no ſcruple of it: being there, I joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my ſelf with thoſe parties that pretended for the King, and how wickedly I lived there, the Lord he knowes, and grant me pardon for the ſame, for though naturally I inclined too much to wickedneſſe, yet evill ſociety helped it; when I had thus lived for a while, the Lord eſſayed to reclaym me by the Rod of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, but in ſtead of making a ſanctified uſe of that affliction, I became worſe, and lived more diſſolutely in Priſon, then I had done before; ſo that my heart grew more and more hardened in wickedneſſe. Being got free out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in ſtead of returning to <hi>Scotland,</hi> as I was adviſed by my well wiſhers, I went back to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where I joyned again to that party I had been formally with, but remaining there but ſome few moneths, I was ingaged with <hi>Montroſſe,</hi> he undertaking by his means, as he caled it, to reduce <hi>Scotland</hi> to obedience But entring at <hi>Dumfreis,</hi> his ſtay was ſhort, and his ſucceſſe not great, where I left him, and did never again ſee him, whil he had with his bloody Iriſhes and others his wicked Aſſociates, made havock of the people of God in ſeverall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts: And after that deplorable fight of <hi>Kilſyth,</hi> Sathan again enticed me to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58071:4"/>
joyn with that wick<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d crue, but the Lord did not ſuffer them long to proſper, in their w<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ckedneſſe, for what reward they received for their former cruelties and blood-ſh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, there may be ſome here were eye-witneſſes: And for my ſelfe, The Lord again ſhewed h<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mſelfe diſpleaſed with my wayes, by making me priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, where I was kept in <hi>Sterling</hi> for a twelve moneth; but the civility I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there being ſuch, and my liberty not much reſtrained, I did not take it as an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction from God, never taking notice of Gods hand or diſpleaſure againſt me for oppoſing his cauſe; I being releaſed from that eaſie reſtraint (I cannot call it impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment) returned to that place of the Kingdome, where I had greateſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: and after I had given a ſeeming ſatisfaction to the Church (I muſt ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly acknowledge the deceitfulneſſe and hypocriſie of my own heart, for it was not cordiall) I was after ſome conference with the miniſtery, admitted to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the mutuall League and Covenant. Truly, at that time I did it ſomething unwillingly, not being deſirous to joyne with thoſe in <hi>England,</hi> I did conceive were enemies to Monarchicall Government, and no great friends to the perſon of our late King, as by wofull experience we have ſeen prove too true: yet though there be a wicked party now prevailing in <hi>England,</hi> who have ſhaken oft all fear of God, by ſubverting Religion, allowing of a deteſtable mixture of all Sects and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, deſtroying the Lords annointed our late Soveraign, and keeping in exile our preſent King, overthrowing Monarchy, and in a word tollerating all Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme and prophanity; yet I am conſident there is a party in that Kingdome, who makes conſcience of that Covenant, and whom the Lord will at laſt raiſe up, though at preſent they be borne down by the tyranny of the Sectaries, and that God will make them and the faithfull party of this land, inſtrumentall for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhing and reſtoring Religion in doctrine and diſcipline to that purity, which God in his word hath allowed, and (it ſhall be my prayer) our now gracious King to his juſt rights and inheritance.</p>
            <p>Thus when I had lived for a time in the country, making little conſcience of performing either publick or private duties to God, delighting more in the ſociety of thoſe who were no great friends to his cauſe, then in the faithfull ſervants of God, or thoſe made conſcience to walke more ſtrictly in their wayes; At laſt I was ingaged in that late diſhonorable Ingagement in <hi>England;</hi> what ſucceſſe that had, and how the Lord ſhewed his wrath againſt us, by rubbing diſhonour upon our Nation, and puniſhment upon a great many both leaders and others, I need not to relate; And among the reſt, the Lord did again afflict me with impriſonment; then, while the Rod was upon me, I began in ſome meaſure to humble my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and to ſeek him more earneſtly, by making conſcience both of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and private duties: and I was not wanting of making vowes and promiſes, that if the Lord would then deliver me from that affliction, I ſhould become a new creature, and forſake my former ſinfull courſes; but alas, It proved but a hypocritical <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>laſh, for no ſooner had the Lord removed his Rod, and reſtored me to my former liberty, but with the dog to the vomit, and the ſow to the pudle,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58071:4"/>
fell I back to my former ſinfull courſe of living. So returning from <hi>England,</hi> I went to <hi>Holland,</hi> vomiting out againſt the cauſe of God, and the perſons who had the chiefe managing of affaires, both in State and Church, all the malicious invective raylings, and bitter expreſſions that I could deviſe. And there again did I aſſociate my ſelf with <hi>James Grahame,</hi> he having purchaſed, or as I ſaid before, rather extorted a Commiſſion from this King to enter this Kingdome, that he might be the only man, (as he would have made the world beleeve) to ſet the Crown upon his Majeſties Head. But how the Lord hath diſappointed his vain projects, by bringing him to this kingdome to make him a publike example of juſtice, where he had been ſo inſtrumentall in the ſhedding of the blood of Gods people, is known to you all. And I cannot but acknowledge the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God to me in particular, who while I was in the late fight, where I was grievouſly wounded and taken priſoner, that the Lord did not deſtroy me as he did many others who fell by the ſword, but hath reſerved me to this time, where though I am to receive this temporall judgement for my body, yet my hope is, that he intends mercifully for my ſoul.</p>
            <p>Now the main things that are to be here obſerved, are, Firſt Gods deliverance of his people from the Rods of their oppreſſours, though it did lye upon them for a time, for ſome reaſons ſeeming good to our only wiſe God. That ſo ye that are Gods people of this land, who have faithfully adhered to his cauſe, may ſtand faſt, and thoſe who have the publike managing of affairs in Church and State may prove faithfull, and neither upon the one hand incline to that accurſed courſe of Malignancy, which the Lord hath ſhewen evidences of his wrath againſt ſo much; nor upon the other hand, to the aſſociating, or any wayes countenancing thoſe Sectaries of the neighbour Kingdoms, enemies to Religion and all Government; But that al the Land, Rulers &amp; people, would with their hearts &amp; ſpirits, be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Lord for his former mercies, and ſeek him in ſincerity in time coming without by-reſpects or ends, only having the glory of God, and the good of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion before your eyes, and conſequently, the King (then) will get what is due. This being done, feare not, but the Lord will deliver you from all your feares, (though they ſeem great) and get glory to himſelf, in the deſtruction of all thoſe ſhall riſe up againſt him; though they ſeem now to build on the high clifts of the Rocks, and that the foundations they have laid are very ſtrong, yet the Lord will let it be ſeen, who builds not upon him, the foundation is ſandy, and the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall not be of long continuance.</p>
            <p>The next thing I would have taken notice of, is, That all thoſe of my kinred or acquaintance, and all others who ever have joyned, or would joyn (if occaſion ſhould offer) againſt the cauſe of God, would take notice of Gods judgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all who have hitherto oppoſed his work; and how that he hath carried on the ſame in deſpite both of all publick oppoſition, and all ſecret plotings and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations; Which things if they will lay to heart, and ſeriouſly conſider, and ſeek in unto God by unfeigned repentance for their former guiltineſſe, and now
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58071:5"/>
prove themſelves faithfull at this nick of time, in ſtanding for the maintenance of his truth, they may be ſure to meet with a mercifull God, who is ſlow to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, long-ſuffering, and abounding in mercy: But after ſo much convincing light, and ſo cleer evidences of the wrath of God againſt all the oppoſers of his truth, if they will ſtill perſevere in their former wayes, and malice to God, his cauſe, and ſervants, they ſhall be ſure, if God ſhall not overtake them with temporall judgements here; they ſhall not eſcape, without repentance, his everlaſting wrath.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing which I ſhall now deſire you to take notice of, is Gods dealing with me in particular, who notwithſtanding of the whole ſinfull courſe of my life which I have been relating, both in relation to publick and perſonall guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hath dealt ſo mercifully with me. And I ſhall draw to a period by declaring how the Lord convinced my conſcience of guiltineſſe. For being now this while by-paſt in priſon, I began after ſome few dayes were ſpent, to run through ſome former paſſages of my life, and finding that I had twice relapſed, I conceived by the lawes of this kingdome, I could expect nothing but death; yet being hopefull that friends would uſe all the wayes they could for my ſafety, (which truly was not wanting). It did not much ſink into my minde; yet ſinding all worldly means to fail, and that death was determined by a certain day (which afterward by a Petition I gave in, was prolonged for a week) then began the terrours thereof to diſmay, and much to daſh me; but caſting my eyes beyond death, upon etetnity: and caſting up the accompt of my former miſpent life, both for publick and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall guiltineſſe, and laying before my eyes the extremity and perpetuity of the pains of hell due to me for ſame, I was extreamly dejected and caſten downe, and the fear thereof made me frequently to burſt forth in tears. Thus finding the weight of ſin, and of Gods juſtice lying upon my ſoul, I was ſtill ſeeking and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to finde out ſome way in my ſelf to ſatisfie Juſtice, but in this I found much matter of diſcouragement, and no comfort, till God in his mercy did hold forth to me a better remedy, and laid down a more ſure foundation, by flying from the law to the Covenant of free Grace, and free Love, which was opened up and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to me by Gods ſervants of the Miniſtry, and ſeverall other good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that gave me a charitable viſit in that my diſtreſſed condition, for the which the Lord comfort their ſouls in the day of their trials and Afflictions: And it ſhall now be my prayer, and I ſhall deſire the aſſiſtance of yours, that through the blood of that Covenant, my ſins may be waſhen away, and my ſoul may be received unto eternall happineſſe, <hi>Amen.</hi>
