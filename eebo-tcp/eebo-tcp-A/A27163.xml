            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F to avoid and eschew vice (according to the saying of the Poet) be a chiefe vertue, and as it were the first degree of wisedome; then it is a necessary point, to know what vice and vertue is, and to discerne the evill and good which either of them bring forth, to the end to beware lest we dash our selves unawares against vice in stead of vertue, and be caught with the deceitfull baits thereof. For this cause the great and famous Philosopher, about to lay open the nature of Morall vertues (according to that knowledge and light which nature afforded him) contented not himselfe with a simple narration of the properties, essence, and object of them, but opposed to every vertue on each side the contrary and repugnant vice; to the end that the sight of them, being so out of square, so hurtfull and pernicious, vertue it selfe might be more admirable, and in greater esteem. And for this cause also God himself, our soveraigne and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Law-giver, that he might fashion and fit us to the mould of true and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid vertue, useth ostner negative prohibitons then affirmative command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his Law; to the end above all things to distract and turne us from cvill; whereunto we are of our selves too too much inclined. And as by this, meane sin is discovered and made knowne unto us, so is the pnnishment al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of sin set before our eyes, by those threatnings and curses which are there denounced: to the end that whom the promises of life and salvation could not allure and perswade to doe well, them the feare of punishment (which followeth sin as a shadow doth the body) might bridle and restraine from giving them over to impiety. Now then if the very threatnings ought to serve for such good use, shall not the execution and performance of them serve much more? to wit, when the tempest of Gods wrath is not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, but also throwne downe effectually upon the heads of the mighty ones of the world, when they are disobedient and rebellious against God. And hereupon the Prophet saith, <hi>That when Gods judgements are upon earth, then the Inhabitants learne justice.</hi> And doubtlesse it is most true, that every one ought to reap profit to himself by such examples, as well them w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are presented daily to their view by experience, as them which have been done in times past, and are by benefit of History preserved from oblivion. And in this regard History is accounted a very necessary and profitable thing, for that in recalling to minde the truth of things past, which otherwise would be buried in silence, it setteth before us such effects (as warnings and admonitions touching good and evill) and layeth vertue and vice so naked before our eyes, with the punishments or rewards inflicted or bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the followers of each of them, that it may justly bee called an easie and profitable Apprentiship or Schoole for every man to learne to get wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome at another mans cost. Hence it is that History is termed of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Philosophers, <hi>The record and register of Time, the light of Truth, and the mistresse and looking-glasse of mans life:</hi> insomuch as under the person of another man it teacheth and instructeth all those that apply their mindes unto it, to governe and carry themselves vertuously and honestly in this life.
<pb facs="tcp:59545:5"/>
Wherefore they deserve great praise and commendation, that have taken paines to inroll and put in writing the memorable acts and occurrents of their times, to communicate the same to their posterity: for there the high and wonderfull works of God doe most clearely, and as it were to the view, present themselves, as his justice and providence: whereby albeit hee guideth and directeth especially his owne, to wit, those that in a speciall and singular manner worship and trust in him (as by the sacred Histories, touching the state and government of the ancient and Primitive Church, it may appeare) yet hee ceaseth not for all that to stretch the arme of his power over all, and to handle and rule the prophane and unbeleeving ones at his pleasure; for he hath a soveraign Empire and predominance over all the World; And unto him belongeth the direction and principall conduct of humane matters, in such sort that nothing in the world commeth to passe by chance or adventure, but onely and alwayes by the prescription of his will; according to the which he ordereth and disposeth by a strait and direct motion, as well the generall as the particular, and that after a strange and admirable order. And this a man may perceive, if he would but mark and consider the whole body, but especially the end and issue of things: wherein the great and marvailous vertues of God, as his bounty, justice, and power, doe most clearely shine; when he exalteth and favoureth some, and debaseth and frowneth upon others, blesseth and prospereth whom hee please; and on the contrarie, curseth and destroyeth whom he please, and that deserve it It is hee also which erecteth principalities, and which maintaineth Common-wealths, Kingdomes, and Empires, untill by the sum and weight of their iniquities they sink themselves into ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. And herein is he glorified by the execution of his most just and righteous judgements, when the wicked after the long abuse of his lenety, benignity, and patience, doe receive the wages and reward of their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. In this (I say once again) shineth out the wonderfull and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible wisedome of God, when by the due ordering of things so different and so many, hee commeth still to one and the same marke which hee once prescribed, to wit, the punishment of the world according to their deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. And this same is most manifest and apparant even in the Histories of prophane Writers, albeit in their purpose it was never intended nor thought upon, nor yet regarded almost of any that read the same; men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting themselves for the most part with the simple recitall of the story, therein to take pleasure and passe away time, without respecting any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter: Notwithstanding, the true and principall use of their writings ought to be, diligently to marke the effects of Gods Providence, and of his justice, whereby to learne to conteine our selves within the bounds of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and the feare of God; seeing that they which have carried themselves any thing uprightly in equity, temperance, and other naturall vertues, have been in some sort spared: and the rest (bearing the punishment of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities) have falne into destruction.</p>
            <p>This consideration ought to perswade every man to turne from evill, and to follow that which is good, seeing that the Lord sheweth himselfe so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed against all them which lead a wicked, damnable, and perverse life. And this is the cause why I, having noted the great and horrible punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherewith the Lord in most righteous judgement hath scourged the world for sin, according to that which is contained as well in sacred as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
<pb facs="tcp:59545:5"/>
Histories; having gathered them together, and sorted them one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another in their severall rooms, according to the diversity of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and order and course of time, which as neare as I could I endeavoured to sollow, to the end to lay downe, as it were in one Table, and under one Aspect, the great and fearefull judgements of God upon them that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled or repugned his holy will. And this I do not with purpose to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them all (for that were not onely difficult but impossible) but to lay open the most notable &amp; remarkable ones that came to my knowledge; to the end that the most wicked, dissolute, and disordered sinners, that with loose reines runne fiercely after their lust, if the manifest tokens of Gods severity presented before their eyes doe not touch them, yet the cloud and multitude of examples, through the sight of the inevitable anger and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God upon evill livers, might terrifie and somewhat curb them: Perjurers, Idolaters, Blasphemers, and other such wicked and prophane wretches, with murderers, whoremongers, adulterers, ravishers, &amp; tyrants, shall here see by the mischiefe that hath falne upon their likes, that which hangeth before their eyes, and is ready to lay hold of them also. For albeit for a time they sleep in their sins and blindnesse, delighting in their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and taking sport in cruelties and evill deeds, yet they draw after them the line wherewith (being more ensnared then they were aware) they are taken and drawne to their finall destruction.</p>
            <p>And this may teach and advertise both those that are not yet obstinate in their sins, to bring themselves to some amendment; and those that feare God already, to strengthen and encourage them in the pursuit and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in their good course. For if God shew himselfe so severe a revenger of their sinnes that take pleasure in displeasing him, there is no doubt but on the contrary he will shew himselfe bountifull, gracious, and liberall in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding all them according to his promise which seeke to please him, and conforme their lives unto his will. Great and small, young and old, men and women, and all other, of what degree and condition soever, may here learne at other mens charges, how to governe themselves in duty towards God, and betwixt themselves, by a holy and unblameable life in mutuall peace and unity; and by shunning and eschewing sin, against the which God (a most just Judge) powreth forth his vengeance, even upon the heads of them that are guilty thereof. Beside, here is ample matter and argument to stop the mouthes of all Epicures and Atheists of our age, and to leave them confounded in their errors, seeing that such and so many occurrents and punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are manifest proofs, that there is a God above that guideth the stern of the world, and that taketh care of humane matters, &amp; that is just in punishing the unjust and malicious. Againe, whereas so much evill, and so many sins have reigned and swayed so long time, and do yet reign and sway upon the earth, we may behold the huge corruption and perversity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and the rotten fruits of that worme-eaten root, <hi>Originall sin:</hi> when we are not directed nor guided by the holy Spirit of God, but lest unto our owne nature. And hereby true faithfull Christians may take occasion so much the more to acknowledge the great mercy and singular favour of God toward them, in that they being received to mercy, are renewed to a better conversation of life then others. In brief, a man may here learne (if he be not altogether void of judgement and understanding) to have sin in hatred and detestation, considering the wages and reward thereof; and how
<pb facs="tcp:59545:6"/>
the justice of God pursueth it continually, even to the extreamest executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is both sharp and rigorous.</p>
            <p>Touching the word <hi>Iudgement,</hi> I have imitated the language of Holy Scripture: wherein as the Ordinances and Commandements of God are called Judgements, because in them is contained nothing but that which is just, right, and equall: so likewise the punishments inflicted by God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the despisers of his Commandements are called by the same name, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 6. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 12. &amp; 22. 8. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 5. 8. &amp; 11. 9. and elsewhere, because they also are as just as the former, proceeding from none other fountaine save the most righteous judgement of God; whereof none can complaine but unjustly.</p>

All which evils are so common and so usuall at this time amongst men, that the World seemeth truly to be nothing else but an ocean full of hideous monsters, or a thicke forrest full of theeves and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or some horrible wildernesse wherein the inhabitants of the earth, being savage and unnaturall, void of sence and reason, are transformed into bruit beasts, some like Tygres or Lyons, others like Wolves or Foxes, others like Dogges and Swine: <hi>Oh sinfull nation</hi> (would the man of God say if hee lived at this houre) <hi>a people laden with iniquity, a seed of the wicked, corrupt children, they have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of</hi>

And so vertue in most men lyeth buried, piety banished, justice oppressed, and honesty troden under foot: in such sort, that all things being as it were overthrowne and turned upside downe, men speake evill of good, and good of evill, accounting darknesse light, and light darknesse, sowre sweet, and sweet sowre.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F wee would consider from whence it is that this great disorder and corruption of manners doth arise, we should finde especially that it is because the world every day groweth worse and worse, according to the saying of our Saviour and Redeemer (Christ Iesus the Sonne of God) That <hi>in the latter dayes</hi> (which are these wherein we live) <hi>Iniquity shall be increased.</hi> And herein wee shall perceive even the just ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God to light upon the malice and unthankfulnesse of men, to whom when hee would draw neere, to doe good unto by offering them the cleere light of his favour, the more they strive to alienate and keep themselves aloofe from him, and are so farre from being bettered thereby, that they shew themselves a great deale more malitious and obstinate than ever they did before: not unlike to those who by nature being bleare eyed, and tender sighted, are rather dazled and dimmed by the Sunne beames, than any wayes enlightened: so men in stead of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better, grow worse, and every adde some increase to their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: to whom also many great men give elbow-roome and permission to sinne, whilest justice slumbreth, and the not punishing of misdeeds giveth them liberty and boldnesse to commit their wickednesse: so that some of these mighty ones shew themselves but little better than the other. A mischiefe to be lamented above the rest, drawing after it an horrible overflow of all evils, and like a violent streame spoyling every where as it goeth: when as they that ought to governe the sterne of the Commonwealth, let all goe at randome, suffering themselves to be roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked asleep with the false and deceitfull lullaby of effeminate pleasures and delights of the flesh; or at least letting themselves be carried head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by the tempest of their owne strong and furious passions, into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger and shipwrackes: when as their carefull watch fulnesse and modesty, accompanied with the traine of other good and commendable vertues, ought to serve them for saliscables, ankers, masts, and skuttles, whereby to governe and direct the Vessell whose steersman they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and those that are their charge, to whom they ought to give a good example of life, and to bee unto them as it were a glasse of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: for they are set aloft, as it were upon a stage, to bee gazed at of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commer. Their faults and vices are like foule spots and scars in the face, which cannot by any means bee hid. And therefore they ought to be carefull to lead an honest and vertuous life, that thereby they might perswade and move the meaner sort of people to doe the like: For it is a true saying of the Philosopher, <hi>Like Prince, like People;</hi> insomuch that every one desireth to frame himselfe according to the humour of his superiour, whose will and manners serve simply for a law to do evill: to the which men use by taking any occasion too hastily to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves over with too much liberty: whereupon followeth an unrecoverable

ruine, no lesse than the fall of a great house, which for want of pillars and supporters that should uphold it, suddenly falleth to the ground; so this ship being deprived of her governour, is set loose and layd open to the mercy of the waves, violence of windes, and rage of tempests, without any direction and government: and so the body of man, not having any more the light of his owne eyes, abideth in darknesse all blinded, not able to do any thing that is right and good, but ready every minute to fall into some pit.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this poore and miserable estate every man rocketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe asleep, and flattereth his owne humour, every man pursueth his accustomed course of life, with an obstinate minde to doe evill: yea many of those that have power and authority over others, according as they are indued and perswaded with a foolish conceit of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, make themselves beleeve, that for them every thing is lawfull, and that they may doe whatsoever they please; never imagining, that they shall give up an account of their actions, to receive any cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement or correction for them; even as though there were no God at all that did behold them. And being thus abused by this vaine and fickle security, they swimme in their sinnes, and plunge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves over head and eares in all kinde of security; giving hearty wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and entertainment to all that approve and applaud their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and that study to feed and please their humour. As contrariwise none lesse welcome unto them, than they that tell them of their faults, and contradict them never so little: for they cannot abide in any case to bee reprooved, whatsoever they doe. And now adayes every base companion will forsooth storme and fume as soone, if hee be reproved of a fault, as if hee had received the greatest wrong in the world: so much is every man pleased with himselfe, and puffed up with his owne vice and foolish vanities. And what should a man doe in this case? It is as hard to redresse those great mischiefes, as if wee should goe about to stop and hinder the course of a mighty streame there where the banke or causey is broken downe: if it bee not by applying extreame and desperate medicines, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate diseases, which are as it were given over by the Physitian, and to the which a light purgation will doe no good. For as for admonitions and warnings, they are not a whit regarded: but they that give them, are derided or laughed to scorne, or reviled for their labours. What must wee therefore doe? it is necessary that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59545:8"/>
wee assay by all means to bring these men (if it be possible) to some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and feare of God; which if it cannot bee done by willing and gentle means, force and violence must be used to plucke them out of the fire of Gods wrath, to the end they be not consumed: if not all, yet at least those that are not grown to that height of stubbornnesse, and of whom there is yet left some hope of amendment. For even as when a Captaine hath not prevailed by summoning a city to yeeld up it selfe, he by and by placeth his cannon against their walls, to put them in seare; in like sort must we bring forth against the proud and high minded men of this world, an army of Gods terrible judgements throwne downe by mighty and puissant hand on the wicked, more terrible and searefull than all the roaring or double canons in the World, whereby the most proud are destroyed and consumed even in this life, all their pride and power, how great soever it be, being not able to turne backe the vengeance of God from lighting upon their heads, to their utter destruction and confusion. And it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by infinite examples. Now because that the nature of man is fleshly, and given to be touched with things that are presented before their faces, or hath been done before time; it is a more forcible motive to stirre them up, than that which as yet cannot be made manifest, but is to come. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I purpose here to set down the great and fearfull judgments, wherwith God hath already plagued many in this world, especially them of high degree, whose example will serve for a glasse both for these that live now, or shall live hereafter. And to the end that the justice of God may more cleerely appeare and shew it selfe in such strange events; before we go any further, we will run over certaine necessary points concerning this matter.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59545:9"/>
who being more hardened and bold to sin, do as boldly exempt themselves from all corrections and punishments due unto them, being altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be subject to any order of justice or law whatsoever: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by how much the more they cannot be punished by man, and that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes can lay no hold upon them; so much the rather God himselfe becommeth executioner of his owne justice upon their pates: and in such sort, that every man may perceive his hand to be on them. Let any adversity or affliction light upon a man of low degree, or which is poore and desolate, no man considereth of it rightly; but talking thereof, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n cease not to impute the cause of this poore soules misery, either to poverty, or want of succour, or some other such like cause. Therefore if any such be in griefe, or by chance fallen into some pit and drowned, or robbed and killed in the way by theeves: straightway this is the saying of the world, That it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth thus to passe, either because he was alone without company, or desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of help, or not well looked to and regarded: and thus they passe over the matter. But as concerning great men, when they are any way afflicted, no such pretences or excuses can be alleadged; seeing they want neither servants to attend upon them, nor any other means of help to succor them: therefore when these men are overtaken and surprised with any great evill, which by no means they can eschew, and when their bold and wicked enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises are pursued and concluded with strange and lamentable events, in this we must acknowledge an especiall hand of God, who can intangle and pull downe the proudest and arrogantest He that lives, and those whom the world feareth to meddle withall. These proud gallants are they against whom God displaieth his banner of power more openly, than against meaner and baser persons: because these poore soules finde oftentimes to their paines, that they are punished without cause, and tormented and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by those tyrants, not having committed any offence at all, to deserve it: whereas (as <hi>Philip Comine</hi> saith) who dare be so bold as to controll or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend a King and his favorites, or to make enquiry of his misdeeds: or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made inquisition of them, who dare presume to informe the Iudge therof? who dare stand up to accuse them? who dare sit down to judge them? Nay who dare take knowledge of them? and lastly, who dare assay to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them? Seeing then in this case, that our worldly justice hath her hands bound behind her from executing that which is right; it must needs be that the sovereigne Monarch of heaven and earth should mount up into his Throne of Iudgement, and from thence give his definitive unchangable sentence, to deliver up the most guilty and hainous sinners to those paines and torments which they have deserved; and that after a strange and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner, which may serve for an example to all others.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow to the end that no man should pretend ignorance for an excuse, God hath bestowed upon every one a certaine knowledge and judgement of good and evill, which being naturally engraven in the tables of mans heart, is commonly called the Law of Nature, wherby every mans owne conscience giveth sufficient testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unto it selfe, when in his most secret thoughts, it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accuseth or excuseth him: for there is not a man living, which doth not know in his heart, that he doth an evill deed, when he wrongeth another, although he had never been instructed elsewhere in that point. So, although that in <hi>Tarquinius Superbus</hi> time <hi>(Cicero</hi> saith) there was no written Law established in Rome, forbidding the ravishing and deflouring of wives and virgins, yet the wicked sonne of this <hi>Tarquine</hi> was not therefore lesse guilty of an hainous crime, when contrary to the Law of Nature he violently robbed <hi>Lucrece</hi> of her chastity: for no man can be ignorant, that it is a most grievous crime to lay siege to the chastity of a married woman, with such outrage: and so the whole people of Rome did esteeme of it, as a crime most wicked, strange, and intolerable, and worthy of grievous punishment. Every man knoweth thus much, that hee ought not to doe that to another, which he would not another should do to him: which sentence the Emperour <hi>Severus</hi> made alwaies to bee spoken aloud, and declared by the sound of the trumpet, in the way of advertisement, as often as punishment was taken upon any offendor, as if it were a generall Law pertaining to all men. This is that equity and justice which ought to be ingraffed in our hearts, &amp; whereof nature her self is the schoolmistresse: from this fountaine all humane and civill Lawes are derived: if we had not rather say that they are derived from that true spring of equity, which is in the Law of God, which Law he hath given for a plaine and familiar ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of his will, concerning just, holy, and reasonable things, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the service, honour, and glory, which is due unto himselfe, and the mutuall duty, friendship, and good will, which men owe one to another: whereunto he exhorteth and enticeth every one by faire and gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and forbiddeth the contrary by great and terrible threatnings (so gentle and mercifull is he towards us, and desirous of our good.) This is that Law which was published before the face of more than six hundred thousand persons, with the mighty and resounding noise of Trumpet, with earthquake, fire, and smoake, and with thunders and lightnings, to make men more attentive to heare; and more prepared to receive it with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, feare, and reverence; and also to put them in minde, that if they were disobedient and rebellious, he wanted no power and ability to punish them; for he hath lightning, thunder, and fire, prepared instruments to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his just vengeance, which no creature under heaven is able to avoid,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59545:10"/>
when by the obstinate transgression of wicked men he is provoked to anger and indignation against them. This is that holy law which hath been set forth by the Prophets; by the rule whereof, all their warnings, exhortings, and reproovings have been squared. To this Law, the onely begotten Son of God, our Saviour and Redeemer Iesus Christ, conformed his most holy doctrine, bringing men to the true use and observation thereof, from which they had declined, and whereof he is the end, the scope, and perfect accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment: so that so farre it is that a Christian man may be ignorant of it, and have it in contempt, that none can be counted and reputed a true Christian, if hee frame not his life by the rule thereof; if not fully, yet at least as farre forth as hee is able: otherwise, what a shame and reproach is it for men to call themselves by the name of Gods children, Christians, and Catholiques, and yet to doe every thing clean contrary to the will of God, to make no reckoning of his Law, to lead a dissolute and disordered life, and to be as evill, if not worse than the vilest miscreants and Infidels in the world? God willeth and requireth that he alone should bee worshipped and prayed unto; and yet the greater part of the world are Idolaters, and full of superstition, worship Images, stockes, and stones, and pray to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in stead of the Creator. God forbiddeth us to sweare by his name in vaine: and yet what is more rise than that? so that a man can heare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but oaths and blasphemies. Many for the least trifle in the world sticke not to sweare and forsweare themselves. God forbiddeth theft, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, adultery, and false witnesse bearing, and yet nothing so common as backbitings, slanders, forgeries, false reports, whoredomes, cousenings, robberies, extortions, and all manner of envies &amp; enmities. God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that we love our neighbours as our selves; but we, in stead of love, hate, despise, and seeke to procure the hurt and damage of one another, not regarding any thing but our owne peculiar profit and advantage. Is not this a manifest and profest disobedience, and intolerable rebellion against our Maker? What childe is there that is not bound to honour and reverence his father? What servant, that is not bound to obey his master, and to doe all that he shall will him? What subject, that is not tied in subjection to his Prince and Soveraigne? Yet there is not one which will not confesse, yea and sweare too with his mouth, That God is his Lord and Father. Which if it be true, what is then the cause that in stead of serving and pleasing him, they doe nothing else but displease and offend his Majesty? Is not this the way to provoke his wrath, and stirre up his indignation against them? Is it any marvell if he be incensed with anger, if hee be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with revenge, and send abroad his cruell scourges upon the earth, to strike and whip it withall? Is it any wonder, if hee pile up the wicked ones on heaps, and shoot out his revengefull arrowes against them, and make them drunken with their owne bloud, and make his sword of justice as sharp as a rasor, to punish those Rebels that have rebelled against him? For <hi>vengeance is mine</hi> (saith he) <hi>and belongeth only unto me.</hi> Whosoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be that followeth the desires and concupiscence of his owne flesh, and this wicked world, and shall lead a life contrary to the instruction and ordinance of the law of God, yea although he never heard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet is hee guilty thereof, and worthy to be accursed; for so much as his owne conscience ought to serve for a law unto himselfe, by the which he is condemned in those evill actions which hee committeth:

                  <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very man confesseth this to be true, That by how much the more benefits and dignity he hath received from another, by so much he is the more bounden and beholden to him: now it is so, that Kings and Princes are those upon whom God hath bestowed more plentifully his gifts and graces, than upon any other, whom hee hath made as it were his Lievtenants in the world: for hee hath extolled and placed them above others, and bedecked them with honour, giving them power and authority to rule and raigne, by putting people in subjection to them; and therefore so much the more are they bound to re-acknowledge him againe, to the end to doe him all honour and homage which is required at their hands. Therefore <hi>David</hi> exhorteth them, <hi>to serve the Lord even with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 2. 11.</note> This then their high and superintendent estate is no priviledge to exempt them from the subjection and obedience which they owe unto God, whom they ought to reverence above all things. <hi>Yee Princes and high Lords</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>give you unto the Lord eternall glory and strength:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 29. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>give unto him glory due unto his name, and cast your selves before him to do him reverence.</hi> If they owe so much honour unto God as to their Soveraigne, then surely it must follow, that they ought to obey his voice, and feare to offend him; and so much the rather, because hee is a great deale more strong and terrible than they, able to cause his horrible thunderbolts to tumble upon their heads, they being not able once to withstand his puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, but constrained very often to tremble thereat. In all that prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 15.</note> and ordinance ordained and set down by God concerning the office of Kings, there is no mention made of any liberty he giveth them to live after their owne lusts, and to doe every thing that seemeth good in their own eyes: but hee enjoyneth them expresly, to have alwaies with them the booke of his Law, delighteth to reade and meditate therein, and thereby to learne to feare and reverence his name, by observing all the precepts that are contained in that booke. As for civill and naturall Lawes, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they are founded upon equity and right (for otherwise they were no Lawes) therein they are agreeable to, and as it were dependents on the Law of God; as is well declared by <hi>Cicero</hi> in the first and second booke of his Lawes; for even they also condemne theeves, adulterers, murtherers, parricides, and such like. If then Princes be subject to the Law of God, (as I am about to shew) there is no doubt but that they are likewise sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to those civill Lawes, by reason of the equity and justice which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is commended unto us. And if (as <hi>Plato</hi> saith) the Lawes ought to be <note place="margin">

                  </note> above the Prince, not the Prince above the Lawes, it is then most manifest,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59545:11"/>
that the Prince is tyed unto the Lawes, even in such sort, that without the same, the government which hee swayeth can never be lawfull and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. And if it be true, that the Magistrate is or ought to be a spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Law (as it is said) and ought to maintaine the authority and credit thereof, by the due and upright administration of Iustice (for if hee did not this, he were a dumbe Law, and without life) how is it possible that he should make it of authority and force with others, if hee despiseth and transgresseth it himselfe? <hi>David</hi> did never assume so much to himselfe, as to desire to have liberty to doe what hee listed in his Kingdome, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly submitted himselfe to that which his office and duty required; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, even then when he was installed and established King over the whole Land, a Covenant of peace with the Princes and Deputies of the people: <note place="margin">2. Sam. 5.</note> and we know, that in every covenant and bargaine both parties are bound to each other, by a mutuall bond to performe the conditions which they are agreed upon. The like is used at the coronation of Christian Kings, whereas the people is bound and sworne to doe their alleagance to their Kings; so the Kings are also solemnely sworne to maintaine and defend true Religion, the estate of Iustice, the peace and tranquillity of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and the right and priviledges (which are nothing but the Lawes) of the Realme: whereas <hi>David</hi> was by the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> reproved for the adultery and murder which he had committed, he neither used any excuse, nor alledged any priviledge whereby he was exempted from the rigour of the law to justifie his fact, but freely confessed without any cloake, that he had sinned. Whereby it appeareth of how small strength and authority their opinion and words be, which thinke or affirme that a Prince may dispense with the lawes at his pleasure: by this opinion was the mother in law of <hi>Antonius Caracalla</hi> seduced; who having by her lascivious and filthy allurements enticed her sonne in law to lust, and love her, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire her for his wife, perswaded him that he might bring his purpose to passe, and that it was lawfull enough for him, if hee would, though for other it was unlawfull, seeing that hee was Emperour, and that it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not to him to receive, but to give lawes: by which perswasion, that brave marriage was concluded and made up, contrary to the law of nature and nations, and to all honesty and vertue. So it was reported how <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byses</hi>

In like manner the trencher Philosopher <hi>Anaxarchus,</hi> after that he had told <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great with a loud voice, that hee ought not to <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> feare the penalty of any law, nor the reproach nor blame of any man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it belonged onely to his office to create lawes for all other to live by, and to prescribe the limits of lawfull and lawlesse things; and that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him, being a conquerour, to rule like a lord and a master, and not to obey any vaine conceit of law whatsoever; and that what thing soever the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59545:11"/>
King did, the same was sacred, just and lawful, without exception. And by this means made his proceedings farre more dissolute and outragious in many things than ever they were before. <hi>Dion</hi> in the Epitome of <hi>Xiphiline</hi> reporteth, how the Emperours were wont to usurpe this priviledge, to be exempted from all law, that they might not be tyed to any necessity of doing or leaving undone any thing, and how in no case they would endure to be subject to any written ordinances: the which thing is manifest even in the behaviour of the chiefest of them, as well in regard of their life and manners, as of the government that they used in their Common-wealths. For first of all, <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> having kept in his owne hand the office of the <hi>Triumvir</hi> ten yeares (as <hi>Suetonius</hi> testifieth) hee also usurped the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes office and authority, and that till his dying day: and likewise tooke upon him the Censorship; namely, the office of correcting and governing manners and lawes, if need required: whose successors (a man may truly say for the most part) trampled under their feet all sincere and sacred lawes, by their notorious intemperance, dissolutenesse, and cruelties. And yet for all this there wanted not a parasiticall Lawyer, who to please the Emperor his lord and master the better, and to underprop, and as it were seele over with a faire shew that tyrannicall government used by other Emperours; foisted in this as a law amongst the rest, <hi>Princeps legibus solutus est,</hi> That the Prince was exempted from all law. As for that which they alleadge out of <hi>Aristotles</hi> Politiques, it maketh nothing to set a colour upon this counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit: (for saith <hi>Aristotle)</hi> If there be any man that excelleth so in vertue above all others, that none is able to compare with him, that man is to be accounted as a God amongst men, to whom no law may be prescribed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is a law unto himselfe: all which I grant to be true, if that which was presupposed could take place: for where no transgression is found, there no law is necessary; according as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>The law was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the just, but for the unjust and offendors:</hi> but where is it possible to find such a Prince so excellent and so vertuous, that standeth not in need of some law to be ruled by?</p>
               <p>Of the like force and strength is that which is written in the first booke of Institutions, <hi>tit.</hi> 2. the words are these: <hi>The Princes pleasure serveth for a law, because the whole body of the people hath translated all their authority, power, and jurisdiction unto him.</hi> This is spoken of the Romane Emperours, but upon the ground of so slender and silly reason, that upon so weake a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation it can never stand: for if it be demanded, whether this action of the people, of giving over their right and prerogative to their Prince, be willing or constrained, what answer will they make? If it be by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint and feare (as it is indeed) who will not judge this usurping of their liberty utterly unjust and tyrannicall, when one man shall arrogate that to himselfe which pertaineth to many, yea to the whole body of the people? And admit that this reason was effectuall, yet the glosse upon the place saith very notably, That the Princes pleasure may be held for a law, so farre forth as that which pleaseth him be just and honest: giving us to know thus much thereby, That every will and pleasure of a Prince may not indifferently be allowed for a law, if it be an unjust and dishonest acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and contrary to the rule of good manners. Moreover, it appeareth by the Customes of many antient people and Realmes, That Princes had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this license given them, to doe what they listed: for let them be never

And first we are to understand, that when God said, <hi>Thou shalt have none other Gods before me,</hi> hee condemneth under these words the vanity of men that have forged to themselves a multitude of gods: hee forbiddeth all false Religion, and declareth, That hee would be acknowledged to be the sole and true God; and that we should serve, worship, love, feare, and obey him in and above all things; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it be that doth otherwise, either by hindring his worship, or afflicting those that worship him, the same man provoketh his heavy wrath to bee throwne upon him, to his utter ruine and destruction. This is the indignation that lighted upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of Aegypt, as wee read in the booke of God: who being one of the most puissant Kings of the earth in his age, God chose him for an object to shew his wonderfull power, by the means of horrible plagues and scourges which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59545:13"/>
hee cast upon him, and by destroying him with all his armies at the length, as his rebellion well deserved: For he like a cruell Tyrant conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing to oppresse the children of Israel, without giving them any release or breathing time from their misery, or liberty to serve God, although by <hi>Moses</hi> in the name and authority of God (who made himselfe well enough knowne unto him, without the help of any written law) hee was many times instantly urged and requested thereunto: so many judgements and punishments assayled him one in the necke of another, in such sort, that at length he was overtaken and ensnared therewith. First of all, the very waters of Aegypt being converted into bloud, proclaimed warre against him: then the frogges which covered the face of the earth, climbed up even to his chamber and bed, and filling every corner of his land, soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him an alarme: next a muster of lice and gnats, and such other trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome and stinking creatures, summoned him to combate: an handfull of embers seattered in the aire by <hi>Moses,</hi> were unto him as the strokes of a stone or a shaft, which did wonderfully disfigure their bodies with boyles and most noysome scabbes: afterward the grashoppers were put in battell array against him, together with the hailestones, horrible thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and lightenings, wasting and spoyling, and running up and downe grievously through his whole land. After all these bitter blowes, the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant being cut short, and being so besieged on every side with hideous and palpable darknesse, that he could not tell which wayes to turne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, yet would hee not be brought to any reason, but continued obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and hardened against God, though all the elements, with heaven and earth, had taken armour together, and conspired his destruction. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while hee remained in this wretched state, Gods Angell punished him in the person of his eldest sonne, which died suddenly in one night, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the first borne of Aegypt; wherewithall both hee and all his people being greatly moved and grieved, at length gave the Israelites not onely leave, but also hasted them to depart: but anon, as he saw them going, like a man bestraught he ranne after them againe, and pursued them with a mighty army, untill God in the meane while opening a passage for his children overthwart the deep Red sea, attended him in the mid way, where hee surprised and ensnared him, overthrew and violently overtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the wheeles of his chariots, and put his whole army to a burly burly; and that he might utterly destroy him, caused the sea from each side to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to his channell, which drowned and devoured him and all his army. And this is one of the noblest and fearfullest judgements of God that can be mentioned, and therefore is very often recounted in many places of the Scripture, as a thing most memorable above others. Neither ought wee to marvell, if so notable a History as this is not set downe among the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of prophane authors: for that besides their Histories doe not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily stretch so farre, as to record such antient acts, there is also no doubt but the successors of that Tyrant, and all the Aegyptians, sought all means possible to cancell and blot out the memory of their so great and horrible ruine. And if by chance any Historiographer make mention of the departure of the Israelites out of Aegypt, it is done in such sort, that the truth is not onely disguised, but wholly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by them, and in place thereof nothing but lies and falshood foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in.</p>

In like manner was his wrath stirred up against <hi>Iabin</hi> King of Asor, who had oppressed Israel twenty yeares: whose army, though it was great and well appointed, was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding by <hi>Baraks</hi> handfull of men, under the conduct and rule of <hi>Deborah</hi> the Prophetesse, wondrously discomfited; in such sort, that of all the multitude there remained not one that felt not the edge of the sword, except <hi>Sisera</hi> their Captaine; who escaping from the battell by betaking him to his heeles, turned in by chance into the house of a woman called <hi>Iahel;</hi> who hating him, as he slept, with a hammer fastened a naile into his temples; and thus escaping from those whom he feared, he was murthered by her whom he trusted. And so this valiant warriour, as he was overcome in battell by the conduct of a woman, so was he put to death by the hand of a woman.</p>

               <p>A while after it came to passe, that the Princes of the Philistims, who <note place="margin">Iudg 16.</note> had oppressed the people of God by the space of forty yeares, being assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together with all their people in the Temple of <hi>Dagon</hi> their god even then when after their sacrifices, they thought to make themselves most sport and pastime with poore <hi>Sampson,</hi> whose eyes in mockery &amp; contempt they had put out, were altogether massacred by the fall of the house which <hi>Sampson</hi> by his strength pulled upon their heads: which was the greatest overthrow that before times by his means they had received.</p>

Whereas the Gentiles contrarily being extremely visited by the hand of God, felt the plague, but considered not the striker; neither yet considered they their neighbour, but every man shifting for himselfe, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not for one another.

When hee had thus left no devise unpractised that might further to abolish and destroy the religion of Christ, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that, notwithstanding all his malice and cruell rage, it every day (through the wonderfull constancy of Martyrs) increased and grew even against the haire; with very spight and anger he gave up the Empire. And lastly, when he had been tormented with diverse and strange diseases, and that his house had been set on fire with lightning, and burned with fire from heaven, and he himselfe so scarred with thunder, that he knew not where to hide him, he fell mad and killed himselfe. There was joyned to this man in the government of the Empire, one <hi>Maximilian,</hi> whose cruelty and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny against the Christians was so outragious also, that upon a solemne festivall day, when infinite numbers of them were assembled together at <note place="margin">

In like sort dealt he with a whole city in Phrygia, which after he had long besieged, hee caused to be burnt to cinders, with all the inhabitants therein. But the end of this wretch was like his life, even mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable: for lying a while sicke of a grievous disease, the very vermine and such horrible stinke came forth of his body, that for shame and griefe hee hung himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximinus</hi> that raigned Emperour in the East, was constrained to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt <note place="margin">

               <p>His sicknesse was thus: In the privy members of his body, there grew a sudden putrifaction, and after in the bottome of the same a botchy corrupt bile, with a fistula, consuming and eating up his intrails, out of the which came swarming an innumerable multitude of lice, with such a pestiferous stinke, that no man could abide him; and so much the more, for that all the grossenesse of his body, by abundance of meat before he fell sicke, was turned into fat; which fat now putrified and stinking, was so ugsome and horrible, that none that came to him could abide the sight thereof, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof the Physitians which had him in cure, some of them not able to abide the intolerable stink, were commanded to be slaine; other some, because they could not heale him, being past hope, were also cruelly put to death. At length, being put in remembrance, that his disease was sent of God, hee began to repent of the cruelty which he had shewed the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and forthwith commanded all persecution to cease.</p>
               <p>But (alas) this peace was so brittle, that it lasted but six moneths; for even then he sought by all means possible againe to trouble and disquiet their rest, and sent forth a new Edict quite contrary to the former, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their utter destruction. And thus being nothing amended, but rather made worse by his sicknesse, it affailed him afresh, in such sort, that every day growing in extremity, as he grew in cruelty, it at last brought him to

And this in generall was the miserable issue of that lamentable warre: during which, fourscore and seventeen thousand Iewes were taken Prisoners, and eleven hundred thousand slaine; for within the city were inclosed from the beginning to the ending, all those that were assembled together from all quarters of the earth, to keep the Passeover, as their custome was. As touching the prisouers, some were carried to Rome in triumph; others were here and there massacred at their conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors wils; somes lot it was to be torn in pieces and devoured of wild-beasts; others were constrained to march in troops against their fellowes, and kill one another as if they had been enemies.

for the despight and fury which they used towards the Sonne of God and our Saviour; and that was the cause why he, foreseeing this desolation, wept over Jerusalem, and said, <hi>That it should be besieged on every side, and rased to the ground, and that not one stone should be left upon another, because it knew not the time of her visitation.</hi> Likewise said he to the woman that bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him as he was led to the Crosse, <hi>That they should not weep for him, but for themselves and their children,</hi> because of the dayes of sorrow which were to come, wherein the barren and those that had no children, and the dugs that never suckled should bee counted happy. So horrible and pitifull was the destruction of this people, that God would not suffer any of his owne children to bee wrapped in their miseries, nor to perish with this perverse and unbelieving Nation: for (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> reporteth) they were a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the arrivall of these mischiefes, advertised from heaven by the speciall providence of God, to forsake the City, and retire into some far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where none of these evils might come neer them.

               <p>And yet for all this, these dispersed reliques ceased not to vomit out the foame of their malice against Christ, it being so deep rooted an evill, and so inveterate, that time nor reason could revoke them from it. And no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, seeing that God useth to punish the greatest sinnes with other sinnes, as with the greatest punishment: so they having shut their eyes to the light when it shined among them, are now given over to a reprobate and harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned sence; otherwise it were not possible they should remain so obstinate. And albeit (God be thanked) we have many converts of them, yet I dare say for the most part, they remain in malitious blindnesse, barking against, and despighting both our Saviour himselfe, and all that professe his name, although their punishments have been still according to their deserts: as by these examples following shall appeare.</p>
               <p>The Jewes of Inmester, a Towne lying betwixt Calchis and Antioch, being upon a time celebrating their accustomed playes and feasts, in the midst of their jollity, as their use is, they contumeliously reviled not only Christians, but even Christ himselfe: for they got a Christian childe, and hung him upon a Crosse, and after many mocks and taunts, making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves merry at him, they whipt him to death. What greater villany could there be than this? Or wherein could these Devils incarnate shew forth their malice more apparently than thus? not content once to have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Christ the Saviour of the World, but by imitation to performe it againe; and as it were to make knowne, that if it were undone, they would doe it: So also handled they a boy called <hi>Simeon,</hi> of two years and an halfe old, in the yeare of our Lord 1476. and an another in Fretulium five years after that.

And being apprehended and tortured, they confessed that they had done the like at Thirna foure yeares before, and that they could not be without Christiàn bloud, for therewithall they anointed their Priests.

The truth of which story, though I will not stand to avow, yet I doubt not but it might be true, considering that either the Devill might by his cunning so foster and confirme their superstition, or rather that seeing Christ is the subject of their religion as well as of ours, though after a corrupt and sacrilegious forme, and that the Jew did not so much aime at their religion, as at Christ the subject of it, the Lord might shew a miracle, not to establish their errour, but to confound the Jews impiety, especially in those young yeares of the Church.</p>

In which two facts they were apprehended; and at Lincolne thirty two of them put to death, and at Norwich twenty, But this was not all the punishment that they endured: as they proceeded and increased in their malice against Christ and his religion, so he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in vengeance and indignation against them: First therefore at the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of <hi>Richard</hi> the first, whereas some of them presumed to enter into the Court-gate contrary to the Kings expresse commandement, a great tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult arising thereupon, a number of them were slaine, and their houses fired in the City of London, by the raging multitude and from thence the example spred into all other countries of the Land: for they following the example of the Londoners, havocked, spoyled, killed, and fired as many Jewes as they could come by; untill by the Kings Writs unto the Sheriffe of every County the tumult was appeased, and some few of the principall authors and stirrers of this outrage punished.

At North-Hampton a number of them were burnt, for enterprizing to fire the City with wilde-fire, which they had prepared for that purposes besides many grievous impositions and taxes which were laid upon them. At last by King <hi>Edward</hi> the first they were utterly banished this Realme of England, in the yeare 1291: For which deed the Commons gave unto the King a Fifteen.

There fires were kindled every where with the bones of Martyrs; whilest for the space of forty yeares or thereabouts they never ceased to burne those that were followers of that way. Now when they saw that all their butcheries and burnings were not able to consume this holy seed, but that the more they went about to choake it, the more it grew up and increased, they tooke another course, and raised up troubles and seditions in all quarters, as if by that means they should attaine the end of their purpose. Hell vomited up all her Furies of warre, the whole earth was in a tumult, young and old with tooth and naile were imployed to root out the Church of Christ, but God stretching forth his arme against all their practises, shewed himselfe not only a Conqueror, but also a most sharpe revenger of all his adversaries.

               <p>In the raign of <hi>Francis de Valois</hi> of late memory, the first King of France of that name, those men that shewed themselves frowardest, sharpest, and <note place="margin">History of France.</note> most cruell in burning and murthering the holy Martyrs, were also forwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest examples of the vengeance of God prepared for all such as they are. For proofe whereof, the miserable end of <hi>Iohn Roma</hi> a Monke of the Order of the White Friers, may serve; who although in regard of his hood and habit ought not to be placed in the number of men of note, yet by reason of the notable example of Gods vengeance upon him, wee may rightly place him in this ranke. This man therefore, at that time when the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians of Cabrier and Merindol began to suffer persecution, having obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Commission from the Bishop of Provence and the Embassadour Avignion, to make inquisition after and seise upon the bodies of all them that were called Lutherans; ceased not to afflict them with the cruellest torments he could devise: Amongst many of his tortures this was one, To cause their boots to be filled with boiling grease, and then fastning them overthwartwise over a bench, their legs hanging over a gentle fire, to seeth them to death. The French King advertised of this cruelty, sent out his Letters Patents from the Parliament of Provence, charging, That the said
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59545:23"/>
                  <hi>Iohn de Roma</hi> should be apprehended, imprisoned, and by processe of law condemned. Which news when the Caitife heard, he fled backe as fast as he could trot to Avignion, there purposing to recreate and delight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the excrements of his oppression and robbery which hee had wrung out of the purses of poor people: but see how contrary to his hope it fell out; for first he was robbed of his evill gotten goods by his owne servants; and presently upon the same hee fell sicke of so horrible and strange a disease, that no salve or medicine could be found to asswage his paine; and beside it was withall so loathsome, that a man could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure his company for the stinke and corruption which issued from him. For which cause the white Fryers (his Cloysterers) conveyed him out of their Covent into the hospitall; where increasing in ulcers and vermine, and being become now odious, not onely to others, but to himselfe also, hee would often cry, either to be delivered from his noysomnesse, or to bee slaine, being desirous, but not able to performe the deed upon himselfe. And thus in horrible torments and most fearfull despaire he most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly died. Now being dead, there was none found that would give Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to his rotten carkasse, had not a Monke of the same Order dragged the carrion into a ditch, which he provided for the purpose.</p>

But whilest hee thus strongly and endeavourously imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe about these affaires, there began a little sore to rise upon his foot, which at the first being no bigger, than if a waspe had stung the place, grew quickly so red and full of paine, and so increased the first day by ranc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling over all his foot, and inflaming the same, that by the judgement of Physicians and Chirurgions, through the contagious fire that spread it selfe over his whole body, it seemed incurable, except by cutting off his foot, the other members of the body might be preserved: which hee in no case willing to yield unto, for all the medicines that were applied unto it, sound the second day his whole leg infected, and the third his whole thigh, and the fourth day his whole body, insomuch that he died the sameday, his deadbody being all partched as if it had been rosted by a fire.

               <p>In the yeare of our Lord 1527, there was one <hi>George Hala</hi> a Saxon, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the Word and Sacraments, and a stout professor of the reformed <note place="margin">Luther.</note> Religion, who being for that cause sent for to appeare before the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Mentz at Aschaffenburge, was handled on this fashion: they took away his owne horse, and set him upon the Archbishops fooles horse, and so sent them back homewards, conducted by one appointed for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: who not suffering him to ride the common and beaten way, but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him a new course through uncoth paths, brought him into an ambush of theeves placed there by the Bishops appointment, who set upon him and murthered him at once: but it is notoriously knowne, that not one of that wicked rabble came to a good end, but were consumed one after another.</p>

In a City of Scotland called <hi>Fanum Ianius,</hi> the chiefe mart Towne of that countrey, soure of the chiefest citizens were accused by a Monke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Cardinall, for interrupting him in a Sermon, and by him condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be hanged like heretickes, when no other crime could bee laid to their charge, save that they desired the Monke to tie himselfe to his text, <note place="margin">History of Martyrs, part. 7.</note> and not to rove up and down as he did, without any certain scope or appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of matter. Now as they went to execution, their wives fell downe at the Cardinals feet, beseeching and intreating pardon for their husbands lives: which he was so farre from granting, that hee accused them also of heresie; and especially one of them (whose name was <hi>Helene)</hi> for hee caused her young infant to be pulled out of her armes, and her to be put to death with her husband, for speaking certaine words against the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which by no testimonies could be proved against her. Which doome the godly woman taking cheerfully, and desiring to hang by her husbands side, they would not doe him the least favour, but drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her in a River running by, that it might be truly said, that no jot of mercy or compassion remained in them. But ere long the cruell Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall found as little favour at another Butchers hands, that slewe him in his Chamber, when hee dreamed of nothing lesse, and in his Cardinalls robes hanged him over the wall to the view of men. And thus God revenged the death of those innocents, whose blouds never cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed crying for vengeance against their murtherer, untill he had justly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished him in the same kinde, and after the same fashion which hee had dealt with them.</p>
               <p>Of this Cardinall, called <hi>David Beton, Buchananus</hi> reporteth many strange acts of Cruelty, both in the Common-wealth of Scotland, in matters of State, as also in the Church, in questions of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how he suborned a false testament in the dead Kings name, whereby hee would have created himselfe chiefe Governour of the whole kingdom, had not his knavery bin soon detected: and how he set many together by the eares of the chiefest sort, not caring which of them soonest perished, so that they perished; glutting himselfe thus with bloud: But amongst all his cruelties, the least was not extended towards the professors of the Gospell, whom hee endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by all means possible, not to suppresse only, but even utterly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish: Many he put to death with fire, divers he forced to revolt with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame torments, and many he punished with banishment: among whom was <hi>George Buchanan,</hi> the reporter of this history; who being taken and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned, escaped through a window, whilest his keepers slept, out of this Lions jaws. Amongst the rest there was one <hi>George Sephocard,</hi> a most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and sincere Preacher of the word of God, in whom his savage cruelty was most eminent, This man abiding at one <hi>Iohn Cockburns</hi> house, a man of no small reckoning &amp; account, about 7 miles from Edenborough, was first sent for by the Cardinall, &amp; after being not delivered, he together with the Vicegerent, beset all the passages that he might not escape; so that <hi>Cockburn</hi> was constrained to deliver him into their hands, upon the assurance of Earl <hi>Bothuel,</hi> who promised to protect him from all injuries: How be it notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Earles promise, and the countermand of the Vicegerent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to meddle with that innocent man, yea and gave command, That no proceedings should be made against him; yet the bloudy tyrant condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him tobe put to death, &amp; also caused the condemnation to be executed:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59545:25"/>
and that which doth more aggravate his cruelty, he caused a place to be prepared for him and his company, hung with tapestry and silke, very sumptuously, that he might be a joyfull spectatour and eye-witnesse of his torments. But marke how the just vengeancee of God shewed it selfe even in that place: for, as it is in the former story, not long after, this vile but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher was murthered in his owne house, by the conspiracy of <hi>Normanus Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slius,</hi> son to the Earle of Rothusia, who early in a morning surprised his porters, and all his servants, in their sleepe, and murthered him in his bed that had murthered so many Christians: and to stop the rage and fury of his friends, hung out his body for a spectacle unto them in the same place where a little before he had with such triumph beheld the tortures of that guiltlesse Martyr: Insomuch that almost all did not only acknowledge the just view of Gods judgement herein, but also remembred the last words of that constant Saint, who being ready to give up the ghost, urtered this speech in effect: <hi>He that sitteth and beholdeth us so proudly in that high place, shall within few dayes as reproachfully lye, as now arrogantly he sitteth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A story not much unlike in manner of punishment, happened in the raign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, to one Sir <hi>Ralph Ellerker,</hi> Knight marshall in the towne of Calice, when as <hi>Adam Damlip,</hi> otherwise called <hi>George Bucker,</hi> a sincere Preacher of the word of God, was condemned to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a traytour in pretence, though indeed for nothing but defending the truth against the dregs of Popery, would not suffer the innocent and godly man to declare either his faith, or the cause he dyed for: but said to <note place="margin">Acts &amp; Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>p.</hi> 1223.</note> the Executioner, Dispatch the knave, have done, not permitting him to speake a word in his owne defence to cleere himselfe from the treason that was objected, not proved against him; but this cruell Tyrant swore he would not away before he saw the trayterous heart out. Now this said Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> in a skirmish or road betweene the French and us at Bulloine, was amongst others slaine, whose only death sufficed not the enemies, but after that they had stripped him starke naked, they cut off his privy members, and pulled the heart out of his body, &amp; so lefthim a terrible example to all bloudy and mercilesse men: for no cause was knowne why they should use him so rather than the rest; but that it is written, <hi>Faciens justitias Dominus &amp; judicia omnibus injuria pressis.</hi>

                     </gap>aver,</hi> one of the Privy Councellors of the King of Scots, was a sore persecutor of the faithfull in that land: for which cause, lying on his <note place="margin">Theatrum hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storicum.</note> death bead, he fell into despaire, and said, he was damned, and a cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away; and when the Monkes came about him to comfort him, he cryed out upon them, saying, That their Masses and other trash would do him no good, for he never beleeved them; but all that he did was for love of lucre, and not of Religion, not respecting or beleeving there was either a God or a Devill, or a hell, or a Heaven, and therefore he was damned, there was no remedy.

               <p>But let us come to our homebred English stories, and consider the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God upon the persecutors of Christs Gospell in our own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. And first to begin with one Doctor <hi>Whittington,</hi> under the raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, who by vertue of his office, being Chancellour to the Bishop, had condemned most cruelly to death a certaine godly woman in a town called Chipping sadberry for the profession of the truth,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59545:26"/>
which the Papists then called Heresie. This woman being adjudged to death by the wretched Chancellor, and the time come when she should be brought to the place of her martyrdome, a great concourse of people both out of towne and country was gathered to behold her end: Amongst whom was also the foresaid Doctor there present, to see the execution perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. The godly woman and manly Martyr with great constancy gave over her life to the fire, and refused no paines or torments to keep her conscience cleere and unreproveable against the day of the Lord. Now the Sacrifice being ended: as the people began to returne homeward, they were encountred by a mighty furious Bull, which had escaped from a Butcher that was about to kill him (for at the same time as they were slaying this silly Lamb at the townes end, a Butcher was as busie within the towne in slaying of this Bull.) But belike not so skilfull in his art of killing of beasts, as the Papists be in murthering Christians, the Bull broke loose, as I said, and ranne violently through the throng of the people, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurting either man or childe, till he came to the place where the Chancellour was, against whom, as pricked forward with some super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall instinct, hee ranne full butt, thrusting him at the first blow through the paunch, and after goaring him through and through, and so killed him immediately, trayling his guts with his hornes all the street over, to the great admiration and wonder of all that saw it.</p>
               <p>Behold here a plaine demonstration of Gods mighty power and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against a wretched persecutor of one of his poore flocke: wherein (albeit the carnall sence of man doth often impute to blinde chance that which properly pertaineth to the only power and providence of God) yet none can be so dull and ignorant, but must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse a plaine miracle of Gods almighty power, and a worke of his own finger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi> also, was one of the grand butchers in this land, what a miserable end came hee unto? Even the same day that Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi> and Master <hi>Latimer</hi> were burned at Oxford, he hearing newes thereof, rejoyced greatly, and being at dinner ate his meat merrily; but ere he had eaten many bits, the sudden stroke of Gods terrible hand fell upon him, <note place="margin">Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, <hi>pag.</hi> 1788.</note> in such sort, that immediately he was taken from the board, and brought to his bed, where he continued 15 dayes in intolerable anguish, by reason he could not expell his urine; so that his body being miserably inflamed within (who had inflamed so many Godly Martyrs) was brought to a wretched end, with his tongue all blacke and swolne, hanging out of his mouth most horribly: a spectacle worthy to be beholden of all such blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy burning persecutors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bonner</hi> Bishop of London, another arch butcher, though he lived long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this man, and dyed also in his bed; yet was it so provided of God, that as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 2114.</note> he had been a persecutor of the light, and a child of darknesse, so his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasse was tumbled into the earth in obscure darkenes at midnight, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the order of all other Christians: and as he had been a most cruell murtherer, so was he buried amongst theeves and murtherers; a place by Gods judgement rightly appointed for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Morgan</hi> Bishop of S. <hi>Davids</hi> sitting upon the condemnation of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Martyr Bishop <hi>Farrar,</hi> whose roome he unjustly usurped, was not long <note place="margin">2099.</note>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59545:26"/>
after stricken by Gods hand after such a strange sort, that his meat would not go downe, but rise and picke up againe, sometime at his mouth, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time blowne out of his nose, most horrible to behold, and so continued unto his death. Where note moreover, that when Master <hi>Leyson</hi> (being then Sheriffe at Bishop <hi>Farrars</hi> burning) had fetcht away the cattell of the said Bishop, from his servants house into his owne custody, divers of them would never eate meat, but lay bellowing and roaring, and so dyed. Adde unto this Bishop <hi>Morgan,</hi> Iustice <hi>Morgan</hi> a Judge that sate upon the death of the Lady <hi>Iane:</hi> this Iustice, not long after the execution of the said Lady, fell mad, and being thus bereft of his wits, dyed, having ever in his mouth, Lady <hi>Iane,</hi> Lady <hi>Iane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bishop <hi>Thornton</hi> Suffragan of Dover, another grand persecutor, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon a Saturday from the Chapter-house at Canterbury, and there upon the Sunday following looking upon his men playing at bowles, fell suddenly into a palsey, and dyed shortly after. And being exhorted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member God in his extremity of sicknesse: So I do (saith he) and my Lord Cardinall too, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>After him succeeded another Suffragan, ordained by the foresaid Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, and equall to his Predecessor in cruell persecuting of the Church; who injoying his place but a short time, fell downe a paire of staires in the Cardinals chamber at Greenwich, and broke his necke, and that presently (let it be noted) after he received the Cardinals blessing.</p>
               <p>The like sudden death hapned to Doctor <hi>Dunning</hi> the bloudy and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Chancellour of Norwich, who after he had most rigorously condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and murthered a number of simple and faithfull servants of God, was suddenly stricken with death even as he was sitting in his chaire.</p>
               <p>The like also fell upon <hi>Berry,</hi> Commissary of Norfolke, another bloudy persecutor; who foure dayes after Queene <hi>Maries</hi> death having made a great Feast, whereat was present one of his concubines; as he was comming home from the Church, where he had ministred the Sacrament of Baptisme, fell downe suddenly to the ground with a heavy groane, and never stirred after, thus ending his miserable life without any shew of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>So Doctor <hi>Geffrey</hi> Chancellor of Salisbury, another of the same stampe, was suddenly stricken with the mighty hand of God in the midst of his buildings, where he was constrained to yeeld up his life, which had so little pitty of other mens lives before: and it is to be noted, that the day before he was thus stricken, he had appointed to call before him ninety poore Christians, to examine them by inquisition, but the goodnesse of God and his tender providence prevented him.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Foxford,</hi> Chancellor to Bishop <hi>Stockesley,</hi> dyed also suddenly. So did Iustice <hi>Lelond</hi> the persecutor of one <hi>Ieffery Hurst.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> the Keeper of Newgate, a cruell enemy to those that lay in that prison for Religion, dyed very miserably, being so swollen, that he was more like a monster than a man, and so rotten within that no man could abide the smell of him. His sonne called <hi>Iames,</hi> after hee had spent all his fathers substance riotously, fell downe suddenly in Newgate market, and there wretchedly dyed. <hi>Iohn Peter</hi> sonne in law to the said <hi>Alexander,</hi> and no lesse cruell to the poore Christians, rotted away, and so dyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:59545:27"/>
                  <hi>Cox</hi> an earnest Protestant in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, and in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time a Papist, and a Promoter, going well and in health to bed (as it seems was dead before the morning.</p>
               <p>All these almost, with many more which I could recite, dyed suddenly, being most cruell and horrible persecutors of the flocke of Christ. Many there were, which though they escaped sudden death, yet did not avoid a most miserable and wretched end. In the number whereof I may place first <hi>Alexander</hi> the Keeper of Newgate, together with his sonne in law <hi>Iohn Peter,</hi> of whom mention was made before: Also Master <hi>Woodroofe</hi> the Sheriffe of London, who used to rejoyce at the death of the poore Saints of Christ, and would not suffer Master <hi>Rogers,</hi> going to his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, to speake with his children: this man lay seven or eight yeares bed-rid, having one halfe of his body all benummed, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till his dying day. Also one <hi>Burton</hi> the Bayliffe of Crowland in Lincolneshire, who having been a Protestant in outward shew in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, as soone as Queene <hi>Mary</hi> was quietly seated in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, became very earnest in setting up the Masse againe, and constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Curate by threats to leave the English Service, and say Masse. This blinde Bailiffe not long after, as he was riding with one of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, a Crow flying over his head, let her excrements fall upon his face, the poysoned stinke and savour whereof so annoyed his stomacke, that he never lest vomiting untill he came home, and there after certaine dayes, with extreame paine of vomiting, crying and cursing the Crow, desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he dyed without any token of repentance. Also one <hi>Robert Baldwine,</hi> who being stricken with lightning, at the taking of <hi>William Seaman,</hi> pined away and dyed. <hi>Robert Blomfield</hi> also, Bailiffe to Sir <hi>Iohn Ierningham,</hi> after he had prosecuted one Master <hi>Browne,</hi> pined away both in his goods and body, by a consumption of both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Swallow</hi> the cruell tormentor of <hi>George Egles,</hi> was shortly after plagued of God, that all the haire of his head, and nailes of his fingers and toes went off; his eyes were well neere closed up, that he could scant see; his wife was also stricken with the falling sicknesse, with the which malady she was never infected before.</p>
               <p>Lastly (to omit many others) one <hi>Twiford</hi> is not to be forgotten; who in King <hi>Henries</hi> dayes was a busie doer in setting up stakes for the burning of poore Martyrs: and seeing the stakes consume so fast, provided a big tree, cutting off the top, and set it up in Smithfield, saying, <hi>I will have a stake that shall hold.</hi> But behold Gods hand; before ever that tree was consumed, the state of Religion turned, and he fell into an horrible disease, rotting alive above the ground before he dyed.</p>
               <p>Besides these, many there were that hanged themselves. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, one <hi>Clarke</hi> an open enemy to the Gospell in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, hanged himselfe in the Tower. So did <hi>Pavier</hi> the Towne Clarke of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, another bitter enemy to the Gospell. So did the sonne of one <hi>Levar</hi> a husbandman, that mocked and scorned at the holy Martyr Master <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> being dead; and that at the same houre, as neere as could be gathered, whilst his father was railing upon the dead Martyr. So did <hi>Henry Smith</hi> a Lawyer, who having been a Protestant, became a Papist. Others drowned themselves; as namely <hi>Richard Long</hi> at Calice, in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eights dayes. <hi>Iohn Plankney</hi> a Fellow of New Colledge in Oxford, in the yeare of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59545:27"/>
our Lord 1566. And one <hi>Lanington</hi> a Fellow of the same Colledge, in a Well at Padua, or as some thinke, at Rome.</p>
               <p>Others were stricken with madnesse: in which ranke place first Justice <hi>Morgan,</hi> of whom wee made mention a little before: Then, a She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffes servant that railed upon <hi>Iames Abbes</hi> a godly Martyr, as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be burned; saying, That hee was an Heretique and a mad man; but as soone as the fire was put to the Martyr (such was the fearefull stroke of Gods justice upon him) he was there presently in the sight of all the people stricken with a frenzy, crying out aloud, that <hi>Iames Abbes</hi> was saved, but he was damned; and so continued till his dying day. So likewise one <hi>William</hi> a Student in the inner Temple, in the midst of his railing against the Gospell of Christ and the Professors thereof, fell starke mad.</p>
               <p>Many other examples of the like kind I could here adde, but he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth to know and read more thereof, let him have recourse unto the latter end of the Acts and Monuments of the English Church, where he shall find a whole Catalogue of such like examples.</p>
               <p>The overthrow of many mighty ones in our Age, serve for a looking glasse to represent the high exploits of the wonderfull judgements which the King of Kings hath sent upon those that have in any place or countrey whatsoever, resisted and strove against the Truth. whereof some after great victories, which by their singular dexterity and worldly wisedome in the mannaging of their affaires, have atchieved, by a perverse and overthwart end, contrary to their former prosperity, have darkned and obscured the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne and glory of all their brave deeds, their good report dying with their bodyes, and their credit impaired and buried with them in their graves. Others in like manner having addressed all their forces, and laid their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and placed all their Pieces and Canons against the wals of Sion, and thinking to blow it up and consume it to ashes, have made many breaches into the sides thereof, yea they have so bent all their strength against it, and afflicted it with such outragious cruelty, and unmercifull effusion of bloud, that it is pitifull and lamentable to remember: howbeit after all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies and practises, their courage hath been at length abated, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves raked one after another out of this world, with manifest markes of the just vengeance of God upon them. For though it may seem for a time that God slepeth and regardeth not the wrongs and oppressions of his servants, yet he never faileth to carry a watchfull eye upon them, and in his fittest time to revenge himselfe upon their enemies.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a kinde of Apostasie and Backsliding condemned by the first commandement of the Law, when as hee that hath been once enlightened by the word of God in the knowledge of salvation, and nourished and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed therein from the cradle, doth afterward cast behind his backe the grace of Gods spirit, or disallow thereof, and exempt himselfe from the service of God, to serve Idols, or make any outward shew to doe it: which kinde of sinne may be committed after two sorts; either through infirmity and feare, or willingly and with deliberation: when not being pressed or constrained thereto by any outward means, a man doth cleerely and of himselfe abandon and forsake the true Religion, to march under the baoner of Satan and Antichrist. And this is also of two sorts; either when a man doth simply forsake the profession of the Truth, to follow su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and Idolatry, without attempting any thing beside the meere deniall of his Faith; or when after his revolt he professeth not onely the contrary Religion, but also endeavoureth himselfe by all means possible to advance it, and to oppresse and lay siege to the doctrine of Gods Truth in those that maintaine the same. By this it appeareth that there are three kinds of Apostasie; one as it were inforced and compelled, the second vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59545:29"/>
the last both voluntary and malitious: which though they be all very hainous and offensive in the sight of God, yet the second and third sort are most dangerous, and of them also one more hurtfull and pernitious than the other, as we shall perceive by that which followeth. Now as all these kinds are different one from another, so I will referre the examples of each sort to his severall place, that the efficacy thereof may be the better perceived. And first of those which have fallen away through feare and infirmity, and afterward in order of the rest. Athough that they who by the conceit and feare of tortures presented before their eyes, or of speedy and cruell death threatned against them, doe decline and slide backe from the profession of the Gospell, may pretend for excuse the weakenesse and feeblenesse of the flesh, yet doubtlesse they are found guilty before the throne of God, for preferring the love of this transitory and temporary life before the zeale of his glory, and the honour which is due to his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Sonne, especially at that time when they are called out of purpose by their Martyrdome to witnesse his sacred truth before men, and he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth most to be glorified by their free and constant perseverance therein: to the which perseverance they are exhorted by many faire promises of eternall life and happinesse: and from the contrary terrified by threats of death and confusion, and upon paine to be discharged from the presence of Christ before God, because they have denied him before men: which is the misery of all miseries, and the greatest that can happen to any man; for what shall become of that man whom the Sonne of God doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge? Now to prove that God is indeed highly offended at this faint hearted cowardlinesse, he himself hath made knowne unto us, by the punishments which divers times he hath sent upon the heads of such of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors. As in the time of the Emperour <hi>Valerian</hi> the eighth persecutor of the Church, under whose persecution albeit that many Champions bestir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themselves most valiantly in that combat of Faith; yet there wanted not some, whose hearts failing them, and who in stead of maintaining and standing for their cause to the death, as they ought to have done, retyred and gave up themselves to the enemy at the first assault. Amongst the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of which doubty souldiers, there was one that went up into the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll at Rome, in that place where <hi>Iupiters</hi> Temple in old time stood, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Sermons, <hi>de Lapsu mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum.</hi>
                  </note> and recant Christ and his profession: which he had no sooner done, but he was presently strucke dumbe, and so was justly punished in that very member wherewith he had offended.</p>
               <p>A woman likewise having renounced her profession, and feeling in her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <note place="margin">Cyprian.</note> no remorse of conscience for her fall, went as she was wont to doe in the time of her rest and prosperity, to the Bathes and Hot-houses to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh herselfe, as if all had had gone well with her; but she was so seised upon and possessed by an evill Spirit, that in stead of pleasure, which she fought for, she fell to lamenting, and tormenting her owne flesh, and chopt in pieces with her dainty teeth her rebellious tongue, wherewith shee had spoken wicked words, and dishonoured God, and tasted meats offered to Idols: and so this poore wretch, whereas she should have wasted her selfe in teares of true repentance, and in the true bath of grace and mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she had more care of cleansing her body from filth, than her soule from sinne, became corrupt and filthy both body and soule, by the meanes of that uncleane spirit which God had given power to afflict her: and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59545:29"/>
armed her owne mouth, which had tasted, chewed, and swallowed that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed food, furiously to rise against her selfe to destroy her: so that she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came her owne murtherer, for she survived not long, by reason that her bowels and intrails were choaked up to the throat with paine.</p>
               <p>Another woman well stricken in yeares, that in like manner had revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Truth, thrust her selfe notwithstanding into the assembly of <note place="margin">Cyprian.</note> the Faithfull, as they were receiving the holy Sacrament. But that holy <note place="margin">Contempt of Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 24.</note> food which nourished the soules of them that believed, turned to her bane; for she found there in stead of peace, a sword; in stead of norishment, deadly and mortall poison, in such sort, that immediately after the receit of that holy Supper, she began to be marvellously troubled and vexed in soule, and felt the hand of God so heavy upon her for her offence commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in denying her Saviour, to shun her persecution, that trembling and stamping she fell downe dead.</p>
               <p>There was also in like manner a certain man, that having renounced his <note place="margin">Cyprian.</note> saith, did notwithstanding present himselfe at the celebration of the holy Supper, presuming to come and eat at his Table, whom he had a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore denied; but receiving into his hand part of the Sacrament as well as the rest, and thinking to put it into his mouth, it was turned into ashes: <note place="margin">Contempt of Sacrament. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 34.</note> whereupon he stood amazed and confounded in himselfe, God manifesting in him, that hee that revoked his faith, and recoiled from Christ Jesus, Christ Jesus would recoile from him, &amp; give him over to death, by depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him of his grace, and spoiling him of the power of his quickning and saving Spirit.</p>
               <p>These are the fearfull examples of Gods Judgements, which Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> reporteth to have light upon back sliders in his time; adding more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that besides these, many were possessed of devils, robbed of their wits, and inraged with fury and madnesse, and all for this offence of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie.</p>

                     </gap>ra</hi> an Italian Lawyer, a man of credit and authority in his countrey, is most pitifull and lamentable; who having embraced the true Religion with marvellous zeal, and made open professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the same, feared not freely to declare his opinion of every point of Doctrine that came in question, and grew in knowledge every day more and more. But it was not long ere he was complained of to the Popes Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour: which when he understood, and saw the danger wherein he was like to fall, after he had long debated and disputed the matter in his owne conscience, the counsell of the flesh and worldly wisedome prevailing, he resolved at last to goe to the Embassadour, to the intent to appease his wrath, and do whatsoever he should command. Thus comming to Venice, and over-ruled with immoderate fear, he confessed that he had done amisse, &amp; craved pardon for the same, promising ever after to be an obedient sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Popes Lawes: and that which is more, when it was enjoyned him, that at his return home he should in his owne countrey openly recant his former profession, he refused not, but performed his recantation in due sort. But it chanced very soone after, that this miserable man fell sicke of body and soule, and began to dispaire of Gods mercy towards him. His Physitian perceiving his disposition, judged, that the cause of his bodies disease was a vehement conceit and thought of minde; and therefore
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59545:30"/>
gave advice to minister counsell to his troubled minde very carefully, that the cause being taken away, the effect also might surcease. To this end many learned men frequented him every day, recalling into his minde, and laying open before him many expresse places of Scripture, touching the greatnesse of Gods mercy. Which things he avouched to be true, but said that those promises pertained not to him, because he had renounced Christ Jesus, and forsworne the known truth, and that for this cause nothing was prepared for him but hell fire, which already in soule hee saw and felt: I would (said he) willingly, if it were possible, love God, but it is altogether impossible. I onely feare him without love. These and such speeches used he with a stedfast countenance; neither did his tongue at any time run at randome, nor his answers savour of indiscretion or want of memory; but advisedly warned all that stood by to take heed by his example, how to listen too much to worldly wisedome, especially when they should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before men to professe the Religion of Christ. And lying in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, he refused all manner of sustenance, rebuking and being angry with his sonnes that opened his mouth to make him swallow some food to sustaine him; saying, Since he had forsaken his Lord and Master, all his creatures ought to forsake him; I am afraid of every thing, there is not a creature that hath not conspired to worke my destruction: let me die, let me die, that I may goe and feele that unquenchable fire, which alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy consumeth me, and which I can by no meanes escape.

And as his renowne was great and famous before for building that sumptuous and beautifull Temple at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem; so was his obloquy and reproach the greater, for erecting Altars and Chappels for the Idols of his wives and concubines, even for every one

of their Idols, to the intent to flatter and please their humors: it was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore just and equall, that the Lord (his wrath being provoked against him) raised up two strong enemies that wrought him and his people much scath. Yea moreover <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> one of his owne servants (whilest hee yet lived) was by the ordinance of God designed King over ten Tribes: and so God punished him for his Idolatry and Backsliding, leaving him but a small portion of the kingdome to continue to his successors: which, had it not been for his father <hi>Davids</hi> sake, had been also taken away. It is true, That we read not that he ever hindred the service of the Temple, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled or perswaded any man to worship an Idoll; yet he did enough to make him culpable before God of a grievous sinne, in that he being the head and Soveraigne Magistrate of the people, committed such wickednes and such Apostasie in Israel: beside, it is a marvellous strengthning, that in all his History there is not so much as any token mentioned, or to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered of his true repentance alter this notable fall.

                  <hi>Roboam</hi> his sonne succeeded him, as well in the likenesse of his sinne, as of his kingdome: for after that the Priests and Levites forsaking the part of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> because of his Idols, and leaving their houses and possessions to strangers, had made repaire to him, for feare of God, and love of his holy service, and that he had disposed and put in order his publique affaires, for the ratifying and confirming of his kingdome; presently he and all his people forsooke the law of God, and gave themselves over to Idolatry and other grievous sinnes: wherefore the Lord also forsooke and gave them over to the hands of <hi>Caesac</hi> King of Aegypt, that raised up a mighty power of men, even a thousand and two hundred chariots, threescore thousand horsemen, with an infinite multitude of footmen to make warre against him: so that all the strong cities and fortresses of Iudah, no nor Ierusalem it selfe, was strong enough to repulse him from sacking and taking them, and robbing the Temple of their treasures and despoyling the Kings pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his riches, and carrying backe into Aegypt a rich prey of the best and beautifullest things that were therein. And this was the first shake that ever this kingdome received since it was a kingdome, whereby it began to

waine and decline. Notwithstanding all this, yet the Lord had compassion and pitty of him and all his people, and would not suffer his dignity to be troden under foot and quite suppressed, but restored him once againe into an honourable estate, because when he was reproved by <hi>Semeia</hi> the Prophet, he humbled himselfe before the Lord, and his Princes also: which is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest signe, that his sinne was not an universall Apostasie, whereby hee was wholly turned aside from God and all hope of grace, but it was a particular revolt, such as was that of his forefathers, the children of Israel, when they imagined that God would be present with them in the idolatrous golden Calfe, and in that figure to worship him, so grosse and sencelesse were they: although yet <hi>Roboams</hi> sin seemeth to exceed theirs in greatnesse and guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse.</p>
               <p>The Iewes that in the time of <hi>Ptolomey Philopater</hi> abode in Aegypt, and willingly renounced the law and service of God, in hope thereby better to provide for their worldly commodities, enjoyed not long their ease and prosperity: for the other Iewes which had couragiously stucke to their profession, and had been miraculously delivered from their enemies, being grieved and chased at their recoyle, made their supplications to the King (whose heart God inclined to favour their suit) that he would permit them to revenge Gods quarrell upon those Apostates as they had deserved: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that it was hard for them to be true subjects to the King, who for <note place="margin">Machab. 7.</note> their bellies sake had rebelled against the commandement of God.

or what else, that goeth about to seduce others from the service of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, to follow false gods. This is the pitfall wherein <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the first King of Israel slipped by the perversenesse of his owne conscience; who as he had by his rebellion against <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and the house of <hi>David,</hi> upreared a new kingdome; so by rebellion against God and his House (in hope by that means to retaine his usurped state and people in subjection) upreared also a new Religion: for distrusting the promises of God which were made him by the Prophet <hi>Ahias</hi> as touching the Realme of Israel, which he was already in possession of, and despising the good counsell of God, in respect of his owne inventions, he was so besotted and bleared with them, that just after the patterne of his idolatrous forefathers, who by their Aegyptian tricks had provoked the wrath of God against themselves, he set up golden calves, and caused the people to worship them, keeping them so from going to Ierusalem to worship God: nor yet content with this, hee also erected high places to set his Idols in; and having restrained the Priests and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites from the exercise of their charge, hee ordained a new order of Priests to sacrifice and minister unto his gods, and proclaimed a newer feast than that was in Iuda; even the seventh day of the eighth moneth: wherein he not onely exiled the pure service of God, but also perverted and turned upside downe the Ecclesiasticall discipline and policy of Gods Church, which by the Law had been instituted. And that which is yet more, as he was offering incense on the Altar at Bethel, when the Prophet cryed out <note place="margin">1 King. 13.</note> against the Altar, and exclaimed against that filthy Idolatry, by denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the vengeance of God against it, and the maintainers thereof, he was <note place="margin">Contempt of Gods Word, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 34.</note> so desperate and sencelesse, as to offer violence to him, and to command that he should be attached; but the power of Gods displeasure was upon him by and by: for that hand which he had stretched out against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, dried up, so that he could not draw it backe againe; and at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, for a manifest declaration of the wrath of God, the Altar rent in pieces, and the ashes that were within were dispersed abroad. And although at the prayer of that holy man, his hand was restored to his former strength and soundnesse, yet returned not he from his unjust and disloyall dealing, but obstinately continued therein till his dying day. Wherefore also the <note place="margin">1 King. 14.</note> fierce wrath of God hunted and pursued him continually: for first of all, he was robbed of his sonne <hi>Abia,</hi> dying through sicknesse: then he was set upon by <hi>Abia</hi> King of Iuda, with an army of foure hundred thousand <note place="margin">2 Chron. 3.</note> men of warre: and though his power was double in strength and number, arising to eight hundred thousand persons, yet was he and his vaste army quite discomfited: for he lost at that field five hundred thousand of his men, beside certain cities which were yeelded to <hi>Abia</hi> in the pursuit of his victory: his courage was so abated and impoverished ever after this, that he could uever recover strength to resist the King of Iudah any more: And so God revenged at once the Apostasie both of the King and people of Israel, and last of all so strucke him after, that he died.</p>

only himselfe like unto the Kings of Israel in their filthy idolatry, but also drew his people after him, causing the inhabitants of Ierusalem, and men of Iuda, to runne a whoring after his strange gods: for which cause <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet most sharply reproved him by letters; the contents whereof in summe was this: That because he rebelled against the Lord God of his Fathers; therefore the people that were in his subjection should rebell against him. Presently the Arabians and Philistims rose up against him, wasted his countrey, robbed him of his treasures, tooke away his wives, and put all his children to the sword, except little <hi>Ochozias</hi> his youngest sonne that was preserved: And after all these miseries, the Lord smote him with so outragious and uncurable disease in his bowels, that after two yeares torment he died thereof, his guts being fallen out of his belly with anguish.</p>

But all this came to passe after the decease of that good Priest his Tutor, whose good deeds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him in saving his life, and giving him the Crowne, he most unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully recompenced, by putting to death his sonne <hi>Zacharias;</hi> whom hee <note place="margin">2 Chlon. 24.</note> caused (for reproving and threatning his Idolatry in a publique assembly, incited thereto by the Spirit of God) to be stoned to death in the porch of the Temple. But seeing he did so rebelliously set himselfe against the holy Spirit, as if he would have quite oppressed and extinguished the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer thereof, by the death of this holy Prophet, by whom it spake; God hissed for an army of Syrians, that gave him battell, and conquered his souldiers, who in outward shew seemed much too strong for them. His Princes also that had seduced him, were destroyed, and himselfe vexed with grievous diseases; till at length his owne servants conspired against him for the death of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and slew him on his bed; yea and his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory was so odious, that they could not afford him a burying place among the sepulchres of their Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amazias</hi> the sonne of this wicked father, carried himselfe also at the <note place="margin">2 Chron. 25.</note> first uprightly towards God in his service; but it lasted not long: for a while after, he was corrupted and turned aside from that good way which he had begun, to tread in the by-paths of his father <hi>Ioas:</hi> for after he had conquered the Idumaeans, and slaine twenty thousand men of warre, and spoyled divers of their cities; in stead of rendring due thanks to God, who (without the ayde of the Israelites) had given him that victory, he set up the gods of the Edomites, which he had robbed them of, to be his gods, and worshipped and burned incense to them, so void of sence and reason was he. And being rebuked by the Prophet of his adverse dealing, he was so farre from humbling and repenting himself thereof, that quite contrary, he proudly withstood and rejected the Prophets threatnings, menacing him with death if he ceased not. Thus by this means having aggravated his sinne, and growing more and more obstinate, God made him an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to hasten his owne destruction; for being proud, and puffed up with
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59545:33"/>
the overthrow which he gave the Edomites, he defied the King of Israel, and provoked him to battell also; but full evill to his ease: for he lost the day, and was carried prisoner to Ierusalem, where before his face (for more reproach) foure hundred cubits of the wall was broken downe, the Temple and Palace ransackt of his Treasures, and his children carried for hostages to Samaria. And not long after, treason was devised against him in Ierusalem, so that he fled to Lachish, and being pursued thither also, was there taken and put to death.</p>

To make up the number of his sinnes, he would needs sacrifice to the gods of Damascus also, thinking to finde succour at their hands: so that he utterly defaced the true service of God at Ierusalem, broke in pieces the holy Vessels, lockt up the Temple dores, and placed in their steads his abhominable Idols, for the people to worship, and erected Altars in every corner of the city to doe sacrifice on. But as he rebelled on every side against his God, so God raised up enemies on every side to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe him: the Edomites and Philistims assaulted him on every side, beat his people, tooke and ransackt his cities: on the other side, the Assyrians whom he had hired with a great sum for his help, turned to his undoing and utter overthrow and confusion.</p>

And that which is yet more, and worst of all, he made no account nor reckoning of the admonitions of the Prophets; but the rather and the more hardened his heart, to runne out into all manner of cruelty and wickednesse, that his sinnes might have their full measure. For the very stones of the streets of Ierusalem were stained from one corner to another with the guiltlesse and innocent bloud of those that either for disswading him from, or not yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto his abhominable and detestable Idolatry, were cruelly murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Amongst the number of which slaine innocents, many suppose that the Prophet <hi>Esayas</hi> (although he was of the bloud-royall) was with a <note place="margin">2 King. 12.</note>

Wherefore the flame of Gods ire was kindled against him and his people: so that he stirred up the Assyrians against them; whose power and force they being not able to resist, were subdued, and the King himselfe taken and put in fetters, and bound in chaines, carried captive to Babylon: but being there in tribulation, hee humbled his soule, and prayed unto the Lord his God; who for all his wicked, cruell, and abhominable Apostasie was intreated of him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him to mercy; yea and brought him againe to Ierusalem into his unhoped for kingdome. Then was he no more unthankfull to the Lord for his wonderfull deliverance, but being touched with true repentance for his former life, abolished the strange gods, broke downe their Altars, and restored againe the true Religion of God, and gave strait commandement to his people to doe the like. Wherein it was the pleasure of the Highest, to leave a notable memoriall unto all posterity, of his great and infinite mercy towards poore and miserable sinners, to the end that no man (be his sinnes never so hainous) should at any time despaire: for, <hi>Where sin aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,</hi>

This is the Sinne against the Holy Ghost, which is mentioned in the sixth and tenth chapter to the Hebrewes and in the twelfth of <hi>Luke;</hi> and in another place, it is called a <hi>Sinne unto death,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is impardonable, by reason that no excuse of ignorance can be pleaded, nor any plaister of true repentance applyed unto it. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata's of the old Testament under the Law were not guilty of this sinne: for although there were many that willingly and malitiously revolted and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59545:34"/>
set themselves against the Prophets of God, making warre as it were with the Holy Ghost; yet seeing they had no such cleere testimonies of Christ Iesus, and declaration of Gods Spirit as we have, their sinne cannot be properly said directly to be against the Holy Ghost, and so never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: according to the description of this sinne in those passages of Scripture which were before recited, as it may manifestly appeare by the former example of King <hi>Manasses.</hi> The Apostle himselfe likewise doth averre the truth hereof, when he saith, <hi>If we sinne willingly after that we have</hi>

                  <hi>received the knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sinnes, but a fearefull looking for of judgement, and violent fire, which shall devoure the adversaries. If any man despised</hi> Moses <hi>Law, he died without mercy, under two or three witnesses: of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be worthy, which treadeth under foot the Sonne of God, and counteth the bloud of the new Testament as a prophane thing, whereby he was sanctified, and doth despight to the Spirit of Grace.</hi> Here we may see that this sinne is proper to those onely that lived under the Gospell, and have tasted of the comfort and knowledge of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iudas Iscariot</hi> (that wicked and accursed Varlet) committed the deed, and feeles the scourge of this great sinne: for he (being a Disciple, nay an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Christ Iesus) moved with covetousnesse, after he had devised and concluded of the manner and complot of his treason with the enemie, sold his Lord and Master, the Savior of the World, for thirty pieces of silver, and betrayed him into the bands of theeves and murtherers, who sought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his destruction. After this vile traitour had performed this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable purpose (by reason whereof he is called <hi>the sonne of perdition)</hi> he could finde no rest nor repose in his guilty conscience, but was horribly troubled and tormented with remorse of his wickednesse, judging himselfe worthy of a thousand deaths, for betraying that innocent and guiltlesse bloud. If hee looked up, he saw the vengeance of God ready to fall upon him and insnare him: if hee looked downe, he saw nothing but hell gaping to swallow him up: the light of this world was odious to him, and his own life displeased him, so that being plunged into the bottomlesse pit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, he at last strangled himselfe, and burst in twaine in the midst, and all <note place="margin">Math. 27 Acts 1.</note> his bowels gushed out.</p>
               <p>There is a notable example of <hi>Lucian,</hi> who having professed Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity <note place="margin">Suid.</note> for a season under the Emperour <hi>Trajan,</hi> fell away afterwards, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came so prophane and impious, as to make a mocke at Religion and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; whereupon his sirname was called <hi>Atheist.</hi> This wretch, as he barked out (like a foule mouthed dog) bitter taunts against the religion of Christ, seeking to rend and abolish it, so he was himselfe, in Gods vengeance, torne in pieces and devoured of dogs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Porphyrie</hi> also (a whelp of the same litter) after he had received the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, for despight and anger that he was reproved of his faults by the Christians, set himselfe against them, and published books full of horrible blasphemies, to discredit and overthrow the Christian Faith.

in the Christian faith, and afterward a while a profest reader thereof to others in the Church, as soone as he had obtained the Empire, maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously revolted from his profession, and resisted with all his power, the Faith and Church of Christ, endeavouring by all means possible, either <note place="margin">Socrat. Theod. Sozom.</note> by force to ruinate and destroy it, or by fine sleights and subtilties to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine it. And because his purpose was to doe what hurt hee could to Christians, therefore he studied by all he could, to please, content, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the contrary party, I meane the Painims: he caused their temples first to be opened, which <hi>Constantine</hi> his predecessor had caused to be shut up: he tooke from the Christian Churches and their Ministers those privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, liberties, and commodities which the said <hi>Constantine</hi> had bestowed <note place="margin">A theisme, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 25.</note> upon them: and not content with this, he confiscated the Church revenues, and imposed great taxes and tributes upon all that professed the name of Christians, and forbad them to have any schooles of learning for their children. And yet more to vexe and grieve them, he translated many orders of the Church discipline and policy into Paganisme. After he had thus by all means striven to beat down the Scepter of Christs kingdome, it tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned quite contrary to his expectation; for in stead thereof, the scepter of his owne kingdome was broken and brought to nought: at that time when making warre upon the Persians, he was wounded with an arrow, which <note place="margin">

The number of his souldiers was so innumerable, and his strength so impregnable, that he made no other reckoning but to be lord of Persia in a very short space. But loe how the Lord overturneth the attempts of his enemies: This great army (as S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> reporteth against the Heathen) in which he put so much confidence, seemed ere long to be rather a vaste and weak multitude of women and infants, than an host of Warriours: for by evill and foolish conduct and government, there rose so great a famine amongst them, that their horses which were provided for the battell, served for their bellies, yea and for want of that too, many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds died for hunger and thirst. Even when he skirmished, his owne side came to the worse, doing more scath to themselves, than to their enemies; and lastly (leading them so undiscreetly) they could not by any means escape, out were constrained after he was slaine, to intreat the Persians to suffer them to retyre; and so as many as could, escaped and fled away to save their lives.

That is true (quoth he) but I hope in the bountifull mercy of God; that for the love of Christ who died for me, my blacke sinnes shall not be imputed to me.

But <hi>Silvanus</hi> the Bishop of Nazaren mightily withstood and reproved him, for depraving so worthy a man now dead; and offering his life for the truth, made this bargain with <hi>Sabinianus,</hi> That if Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> the next day did not by some miracle te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the falsenesse of his cause, he would offer his throat to the hangman, and abide death; but if he did, that then he should die. This was agreed upon by each party, and the day following, both of them accompanied with great expectation of the people, resorted unto the Temple of Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem to decide the controversie. Now the day was past, and no miracle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, so that <hi>Silvanus</hi> was commanded to yeeld his neck to that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which himselfe was Author of: which as he most willingly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently did, behold, an Image like to Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> in shew, appeared and stayed the hangmans hand, which was now ready to strike: and vanishing forthwith, another miracle succeeded; <hi>Sabinianus</hi> head fell from his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, no man striking at it, and his carkasse remained upon the ground dead and sencelesse. Whereat the people amased, praising God, clave unto <hi>Silvanus,</hi> and abjured <hi>Sabinianus</hi> heresie. Whence wee may observe the wonderfull wisedome of God, both in punishing his enemies, and trying his children whither they will stand to his Truth or no; and learne thereby, neither rashly to measure and limit the purposes of God, nor yet timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously to despaire of help in a good cause, though we see no meanes nor likelihood thereof.</p>

Now in the meane while one <hi>Sergius</hi> a Monk (flying for heresie into Arabia) instructed him in the heresie of <hi>Nestorius:</hi> a while after, his Master died without children, and left behinde him much riches, and his wife a widow of fifty yeares of age, whom <hi>Mahomet</hi> married, and when she died, was made heire of all her riches. So that now (what for his wealth and cunning in Magick) he was had in high honour among the people. Wherefore (by the counsell of <hi>Sergius)</hi> hee called himselfe the great Prophet of God. And shortly after (when his fame was published) he devised a Law and kinde of Religion called Alcaron, wherein hee bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed something almost of all the heresies that were before his time, with the Sabellians he denied the Trinity: with the Maniches he said there was but two persons in the Deity: he denied the equality of the Father with the Sonne, with <hi>Eunomius:</hi> and said with <hi>Macedone</hi> that the Holy Ghost was a creature; and approved the community of women with the Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laits: he borrowed of the Jewes circumcision; and of the Gentiles much superstition; and somewhat he tooke of the Christian verity, besides many devillish fantasies invented of his owne braine: those that obeyed his Law, he called <hi>Sarazins.</hi> Now after he had lived in these monstrous abuses forty yeares, the Lord cut him off by the falling sicknesse, which he had dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a long time, saying when he was taken therewith, that the Angell <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> appeared unto him, whose brightnesse hee could not behold: but the Lord made that his destruction, which be imagined would be for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and setting forth his Sect.</p>
               <p>Infinite be the examples of the destruction and judgement of private <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Stow</hi> Chron.</note> Heretiques in all ages, and therefore we will content our selves with them that be most famous. In the yeare of our Lord 1561, and the third yeare of the raigne of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> there was in London one <hi>William Geffery,</hi> that constantly avouched a companion of his called <hi>Iohn Moore</hi> to bee Christ our Saviour, and could not bee reclaimed from this mad perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, untill hee was whipped from Southwarke to Bedlam, where the said <hi>Moore</hi> meeting him, was whipped also, untill they both confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Christ to bee in Heaven, and themselves to bee sinfull and wicked men.</p>
               <p>But most strange it is, how divers sensible and wise men were deluded and carried beside themselves by the subtilty of Satan, in the yeare 1591, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:59545:39"/>
and of the raigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> 3 3, the memory whereof is yet fresh in every mans head and mouth, and therefore I will but briefly touch the same. <hi>Edmund Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Henry Arthington,</hi> two gentlemen, being asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated with one <hi>William Hacket,</hi> sometimes a prophane &amp; very leud person, but now converted in outward shew, though not in inward affection, were so seduced by his hypocriticall behaviour, and the devils extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, that from one point to another they came at last to thinke, that this <hi>Hacket</hi> was anointed to be the Judge of the world; and therefore comming one day to <hi>Hackets</hi> lodging in London, he told them they had been anointed <note place="margin">Hypocrisie in regard of <hi>Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 22.</note> of the Holy Ghost: then <hi>Coppinger</hi> asked him what his pleasure was to be done? Goe your way (saith he) and proclaim in the citie, that Christ Jesus is come with his fanne in his hand to judge the earth: and if they will not beleeve it, let them come and kill me, if they can. Then <hi>Coppinger</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it should be done forthwith; and thereupon (like mad-men) he and <hi>Arthington</hi> ran into the streets, and proclaimed their message aforesaid: and when by reason of the concourse of people they could not proceed any further, they got up into two emptie carts in Cheape, crying, <hi>Repent, repent, for Christ Iesus is come to judge the world:</hi> and then pulling a paper out of his bosome, he read out of it many things touching the office and calling of <hi>Hacket,</hi> how he represented Christ by taking part of his glorified body, &amp;c. Besides, they called themselves his Prophets, one of Justice, another of Mercy. And thus these simple men were strangely deceived by a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous illusion of Satan, who no doubt by strange apparitions had brought them into this vaine conceit. But let us observe the end of it; it was thus: the whole citie being in amaze, tooke <hi>Hacket,</hi> the breeder of this device, and arraigning him before the Maior and other Justices, found him guiltie as well of this seditious practise, as of speaking traiterous words against the Queene: wherefore he was shortly after hanged on a gibbet in Cheap-side, counterfeiting to his last his old devices, and at length uttering horrible blasphemies against the Majestie of God. As for his Prophets, <hi>Coppinger</hi> dyed the next day in Bride well, and <hi>Arthington</hi> was kept in prison, upon hope of repentance.</p>

Whereat he being sore amazed, and notwithstanding all the asses humbling before the Angell, yet pursued his unhappy journey, to his eternall shame and confusion, as one of an obstinate and heardened heart; for he was forced by the Spirit of God to blesse those whom he had purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to curse; and yet further discovering his hypocrisie and envious dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, he was the cause why the Israelites provoked the wrath of God against themselves, through the pernicious and deceivable counsell which he gave to the Madianites; for which cause he himselfe was in the end slain. <note place="margin">

               <p>Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in the first chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> doth at large describe the hypocrisie of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> who that they might seeme zealous to Godward, and charitable toward the Saints, having sold a certaine posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, under pretence of giving the price thereof among the poore, retained covertly a certaine portion of it to their owne use, being so impudent as to lye unto the Holy Ghost the President of the Church, and founder of all secrets: but being attached by the mouth of <hi>Peter,</hi> a just and fearfull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God fell on them both, even their sudden death at the Apostles feet, one after another.</p>

                  <hi>Nicephorus</hi> telleth of one <hi>Philip,</hi> the first Emperour that undertook the name and profession of Christ; but by the report of other writers, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not from any zeale of Religion, or feare of God, but onely to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to counterfeit a kind of honestie, and cover his foule vices and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties under the cloake of Religion. But God quickly espied and punished his deepe hypocrisie; for before he had raigned full five yeares, both he and his son were slain at Verona by his men of war. Let us learn then this lesson, by these examples to carry our selves in all purenesse, sinceritie, and good conscience before God; that our thoughts, words, and deeds, being estran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from all hypocrisie, and dissimulation, may be agreeable and acceptable in his sight.</p>
               <p>Moreover, even as hypocrisie can winde and insinuate her selfe into the pure and sincere service of God, as hath been declared; so doth she play her part with no lesse bravery and ostentation in superstition and idolatry: for the truth whereof (before I proceed further) I will set downe a history not altogether unworthy the reading and remembring. Two hundred yeares <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Enguerran de Monstr. &amp; Vol.</hi> 2.</note> are not yet past, since there was in the raigne of <hi>Charles</hi> the seventh, King of France, a certaine preaching Frier of Britaine, called Frier <hi>Thomas,</hi> who by his dissembling customes and brags, under pretence of a certaine refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of manners, so mightily deceived the whole world, that every where he was reputed for an holy man. This Frier puffed up with a greedy desire of vaine-glory, used to goe from towne to towne, and from countrey to countrey, finding exceeding honourable entertainment in every place; which he tooke very willingly; and that he might ride at the more case, he got him a little young Mule, that would goe very softly; and in this sort appointed, he was accompanied with divers of his owne Order, and many other Disciples that went for the most part on foot by him: the people flocked from all quarters to see him; yea, and many were so besotted, as to forsake their fathers, mothers, wives, and children, to attend upon this holy man. Alwayes when he came neere to any citie, the Burgesses, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Clergy, with one consent came forth to meet him, doing him as much reverence (saith mine Author) as they would have done to one of Christs Apostles if he were alive. Hee was very well content, that honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable personages, as Knights and such others, being on foot, should hold his Mule by the bridle, to be in stead of pages and lacquies to lead him into the townes. His entrance into every citie was with great pompe and magnificence, and his lodging provided at the richest and stateliest Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses house. Now that he might the better play his part, they prepared him in the best and convenientest places in the citie, a scaffold richly hung and garnished, upon the which his custome was first to say Masse, then to begin his Sermon; wherein he ripped up the vices of every estate, but reproved especially the Clergies enormities, because of their concubines and whores which they maintained: wherein he did say nothing but that which was good and lawfull; but in the same he used no discretion, but joyned madnesse and sacriledge with his Monkish nature, in stirring up little children to exclaime upon women for their attyre, promising certain dayes of pardon to them, as if he had been a god: so that Ladies and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen were inforced to lay aside for a season their accustomed trinkets. Moreover also, towards the end of his Sermons hee commanded to be brought unto him their Chesse-boords, Cards, Dice, Nine-pins, and such
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59545:41"/>
other trash, which he openly threw into the fire, to be burned before them all. And that he might give more strength and credit to this his paltry rif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raffe, he caused the men and women to be divided on each side, with a line drawne betwixt them, as in a Tennis-court; and by this means he drew toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sometimes twentie thousand persons: so ready and zealous is and ever hath been the world to follow after such hypocriticall deceivers, rather than the true preachers of Gods Word.</p>
               <p>But let us heare the issue of this holy hypocrite; it was thus: When he had in the fore-named sort traversed as well France as Flanders; it took him in the head to passe the mountaines, and visit Rome; imagining that it was no hard matter to obtaine the Popeship, seeing that in all places where he went, there was equall honour given unto him: or if he should faile of that hope, yet at least the Pope and his Cardinals would entertain him honourably; but it happened farre short of his expectation: for Popes are not so prodigall of their honours, to doe any such reverence to a poore silly Monke, but are very niggards and sparing thereof even towards Kings; so farre are they from leaving their Thrones of Majestie to any other: neither must we thinke that the Pope cared greatly for all those trickes and quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of Frier <hi>Thomas,</hi> seeing he himselfe is the onely merchant of such trash. When he was arrived at Rome, Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> seeing that he came not according to custome, to kisse his holinesse feet, sent for him twice, and understanding that he refused to come, and that he feigned himselfe to be evill at ease, sent his Treasurer, but not to impart to him any treasure, but to apprehend and attatch him. The Frier now perceiving that enquiry was made for him, and that they were at his chamber-dore, leapt out at a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, thinking by that means to escape; but he was quickly taken prisoner by the Treasurers servants, waiting before the dore, and brought before the Consistory of Cardinals: Law proceeded against him, by doome wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though no erroneous opinious could be proved against him, he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to the stake to be burned for an Hereticke: but it was sufficient to make him guiltie, because he defamed the Priests in his Sermons, and had spoken so broadly of their Gossips, and had been so bold to usurpe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of giving pardons, which the Popes claime for a priviledge of their owne See; and besides, had made no more account of him that is a petty god on earth, but had done all these things without his leave and licence: it was a hard matter to be endured of the Bishops of Rome, that a silly Monke should so intermeddle with their affaires, and should derogate any whit from their supremacy, seeing that they quit themselves so well with Kings and Emperours, and can at every sleight occasion make them stoope: neither is it to be doubted, but that Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> was very jealous of the honour which Frier <hi>Thomas</hi> attained unto in every place, and fearfull lest his presence might disturbe his present estate. By this meanes God, who useth all instruments for his owne purpose, and can direct every particular to the performing of his will, did punish and correct the hypocrisie of this Monke, that seemed to be holy and wise, being indeed nothing but foolish, stubborne, and ambitious.</p>
               <p>Moreover, most notable was the hypocrisie of two counterfeit holy Maids; one of Kent in England, called <hi>Elizabeth Barton;</hi> the other of France, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Stow</hi> Chron.</note> called <hi>Ioane la Pucelle:</hi> the former of which, by the procurement and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of one <hi>Richard Master,</hi> Parson of Aldington, and <hi>Edward Bocking</hi>

Doctor of Divinity, a Monke of Canterbury, and divers others, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited such manner of trances and distortions in her body, with the utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of divers counterfeit vertues and holy words, tending to the rebuke of sinne, and reproving such new opinions as there began to spread, that shee woon great credit amongst the people, and drew after her a multitude of favourites; besides, she would prophecy of things to come, as that shee should be helped of her disease by none but the Image of our Lady in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington; whither being brought, she appeared to the people to be sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relieved from her sicknesse; by meanes of which hypocriticall dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion she was brought into marvellous estimation, not only with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, but with divers great men also, insomuch that a book was put in print, touching her fained miracles and revelations. Howbeit, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to delude the people, she began also to meddle with the King himself, <hi>Henry</hi> the eight; saying, That if he proceeded to be divorced from his wife Queene <hi>Katherine,</hi> he should not remaine King one month after, and in the reputation of God not one day: for which and many other tricks practised by her, she with her complices was arraigned of high treason, and after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of all her knavery, drawn from the Tower to Tyburne, and there han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; the holy maidens head being set upon London bridge, and the other on certaine gates of the City.</p>
               <p>The other named <hi>la Pucella de Dieu,</hi> marvellously deluded with her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit hypocrisie, <hi>Charles</hi> the seventh, King of France, and all the whole <note place="margin">

By her meanes Orleance was woon from the English, and many other exploits atchieved, which (to be short) I will referre the Reader unto the French Chronicles, where they shall finde her admirable knavery at large discovered. But touching her end, it was on this sort: as she marched on horsebake to the towne of Champaigne, to remove the siedge, wherewith it was guirt by the Duke of Burgoine and other of the English Captaines, Sir <hi>Iohn Leupembrough,</hi> a Burgonian Knight, tooke her alive, and conveyed her to the City of Roan, where she faigning her selfe with child, when the contrary was knowne, was condemned and burnt. And thus these two holy women, that in a diverse kind mocked the people of England and France by their hypocrisie, by the justice of God came to deserved destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

The twelve Tables in Rome adjudged to punishments those that bewitched the standing corne. And for the Civill Law, this kind is condemned both by the Law <hi>Iulia</hi> and <hi>Cornelia.</hi> In like manner the wisest Emperours (those I mean that attained to the honour of Christianity) ordained divers Edicts and Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions, under very sharp and grievous punishments, against all such villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: as <hi>Constantine</hi> in the ninth book of the <hi>Cod. tit.</hi> 18. enacted, That whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever should attempt any action by Art Magicke, against the safety of any person, or should bring in or stir up any man, to make him fall into any mischiefe or riotous demeanour, should suffer a grievous punishment: in the fifth Law he forbiddeth every man to aske counsell at Witches, or to use the helpe of Charmers and Sorcerers, under the paine of death. Let them (saith he in the sixth Law) be throwne to wild beasts to be devoured, that by conjuring or the helpe of familiar spirits go about to kill either their enemies, or any other. Moreover in the seventh Law he willeth, that not so much as his owne courtiers and servants, if they were found faulty in this crime, should be spared, but severely punished; yet neverthelesse, many of this age gave themselves over to this filthy sinne, without either feare of God, or respect of Law: some through a foolish and dangerous curiosity, others through the overruling of their owne vile and wicked affections, and a third sort, troubled with the terrours of an evill consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, desire to know what shall besall and happen unto them in the end.</p>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59545:42"/>
foreknow his owne fortune, and the issue of this doubtfull warre. Now whereas before whilest he performed the duty of a good King, and obeyed the commandement of God, hee had cleansed his Realme of Witches and Enchanters; yet is he now so mad as to make them serve his owne turn, and to use their counsels in his extremity; adding this wickednesse to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his other great sins, that the measure thereof might be full: he went therefore to a Witch to seeke counsell, who caused a Devill to appeare and speake unto him in the shape of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and foretell him of (Gods just judgement upon his wickednesse) his utter and finall ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
               <p>An example not much unlike unto this in the event, but most like in <note place="margin">

Therefore as soone as he was returned home, being in secret alone with the King, to declare unto him the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches answer, he slew him suddenly, and gave him his just desert, both for his horrible cruelty, and wicked sorcery. Let all them that make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of running to Witches, either for their lost goods, or for recovery of their owne or friends health, remember this example either for their instruction to amend, or for their terrour, if they continue that devillish practise.</p>

Whereupon <hi>Tiberius</hi> himselfe accused him of that crime; but would not have the ordinary Iudges to sit upon it, but by speciall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge committed the enquiry thereof unto the Senate. <hi>Piso,</hi> when every man thought he was preparing himself for his defence against the morrow (like a wise man to prevent all mischiefes) was found dead the day before, having his throat cut, and, as most likelihood was, finding himselfe guilty of the fact, and too weake to overweigh the other side, forestalled the infamy of a most shamefull death, by killing himselfe; although there be that say, that the Emperour sent one of purpose to dispatch him in this manner.</p>

When he listed to passe over the sea, he used no other ship but a bone figured with certaine charmes, whereby he was transported, as if both sayles and wind had helped and driven him forwards; yet his inchanted bone was not of power to save him from being murthered of his enemies.</p>
               <p>The same Author writeth, That in Denmarke there was one <hi>Otto</hi> a great Rover and Pyrat by sea, who used likewise to passe the seas without the <note place="margin">Olaus Magnus.</note> help of ship or any other vessell, and sunke and drowned all his enemies with the waves, which by his cunning he stirred up: but at last his cunning practise was over-reached by one more expert in his art than himselfe, and as he had served others, so was he himselfe served, even swallowed up of the waves.</p>
               <p>There was a Conjurer at Saltzburg, that vaunted that he could gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all the serpants within half a mile round about into a ditch, and feed them and bring them up there: and being about the experiment, behold, the old and grand serpent came in the while, which whilest he thought by the force of his charmes to make to enter into the ditch among the rest, he set upon and inclosed him round about like a girdle so strongly, that hee drew him perforce into the ditch with him, where he miserably died.

of this strange accident sticketh at this day fast in the minds of all the inhabitants of this country; and they say, that this wretch having given himselfe to the Devill, provided store of holy bread (as they call it) which he alwaies carried about with him, thinking thereby to keep himself from his clawes; but it served him to small stead, as his end declared.</p>

                  <hi>Iohn Francis Picus</hi> of Mirand saith, That he conferred divers times with many, who being inticed with a vaine hope of knowing things to come, were afterwards so grievously tormented by the Devill (with whom they had made some bargain) that they thought themselves thrise happy if they escaped with their lives. He saith moreover. That there was in his time a certaine Conjurer that promised a too curious and no great wise Prince, to present unto him upon a stage the siege of Troy, and <hi>Achilles,</hi> and <hi>Hector</hi> fighting together as they did when they were alive; but he could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his promise for another sport and spectacle more hideous and ougly to his person; for he was taken away alive by a Devill, in such sort, that he was never afterward heard of.</p>
               <p>In our owne memory the Earle of Aspremont and his brother Lord of Orne, were made famous, and in every mans mouth, for their strange and prodigious seats, wherein they were so unreasonably dissolute and vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious, that sometime they made it their sport and pastime to breake downe all the windowes about the castle Aspremont, where they kept (which lyeth in Lorraine two miles from Saint <hi>Michael)</hi> and threw them piecemeale into a deep Well to heare them cry plumpe: but this vaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse presaged a ruine and destruction to come, as well upon their house, which at this present lyeth desolate and ruinous in many respects, as upon themselves, that finished their daies in misery one after another; as we shall now understand of the one the Lord of Orne: as for the Earle, how hee died, shall more at large be declared elsewhere. Now it chanced, that as the Lord of Orne was of most wicked and cruell conditions, so hee had an evill favoured looke, answerable to his inclination and name, to be a Conjurer: the report that went of his cruelty was this, That upon a time he put the Baker (one of his servants, whose wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Furthermore, it was a common report, that when any Gentlemen or Lords came to see him, they were entertained (as they thought) very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably, being served with all sort of most dainty faire and exquisite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, as if he had not spared to make them the best cheere that might be:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59545:44"/>
but at their departure, they that thought themselves well refreshed, found their stomacke empty and almost pined for want of food, having neither eaten nor drunk any thing save in imagination only; and it is to be thought, that their horses found no better fare than their masters. It happened one day that a certaine Lord being departed from his house, one of his men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left something behind, returned to the Castle, and entring suddenly into the hall where they dined but a little before, he espied a Munky bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the master of the house that had feasted them of late, very sore. And there be others that say, that he hath been seen through the chink of a dore lying on a table upon his belly all at length, and a Munkey scourging him very strangely; to whom he should say, Let me alone, let me alone, wilt thou alwaies torment me thus? And thus he continued a long time: but at length after he had made away all his substance, he was brought to such extremity, that being destitute of maintenance, and forsaken of all men, he was fain (for want of a better refuge) to betake himselfe to the Hospitall of Paris, which was his last Mansion house, wherein he died. See here to how pittifull and miserable an end this man fell; that having been esteemed amongst the Mighties of this world, for making no more account of God, and for following the illusions of Satan (the common enemy of mannkdi) became so poore and wretched as to dye in an Hospitall among Cripples and Beggars.</p>
               <p>It is not long since there was in Lorraine a certaine man called <hi>Coulen,</hi> that was over much given to this cursed Art: amongst whose tricks this was one to be wondred at; that he would suffer harquebuses or pistols to be shot at him, and catch their bullets in his hand without receiving any hurt: but upon a certain time one of his servants being angry with him, hot him such a knock with a pistoll (notwithstanding all his great cunning) that he killed him therewith.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is worthy to be observed, That within these two hundred yeares hitherto, more Monks and Priests have been found given over to these abhominations and devillishnesses, than of all other degrees of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whatsoever, as it is declared in the second volume of <hi>Enguerran de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stralet</hi> more at large: where he maketh mention of a Monke that used to practise his sorceries in the top of a tower of an Abbey, lying neere to Longin upon Marne, where the Devils presented themselves to be at his commandement: and this was in the raigne of <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth. In the same booke it is recorded, That in the raigne of <hi>Charles</hi> the seventh, one Master <hi>William Ediline</hi> Doctor in Divinity, and Prior of Saint Germaine in Lay, having been an Augustine Frier, gave himselfe to the Devill for his pleasure, even to have his will of a certain woman: he was upon a time in a place where a Synagogue of people were gathered together; where to the end that he might quickly be (as he himselfe confessed) he took a broom and rode upon it. He confessed also that he had don homage to that enemy of God, the Devill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who appeared unto him in the shape of a sheep, and <note place="margin">A sweet kisse doubtlesse.</note> made him kisse his hinder parts, as he reported. For which causes hee was placed upon a scaffold, and openly made to weare a paper containing his owne faults, and afterwards plotted to live prisoner all the rest of his life laden with yrons, in the Bishop of <hi>Eureux</hi> his house, which was accordingly executed. This happened in the yeare 1453.</p>
               <p>In the raigne of the same King, 1457, there was a certaine Curate of a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59545:44"/>
village neere to Soissons, who to revenge himselfe of a Farmer that retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from him the tenths which were appointed to the Knights of the Rhodes, went to a Witch, of whom he received in gift a fat toad in an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then pot, which she had a long while fed and brought up, which she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to baptise; as he also did, and called it by the name of <hi>Iohn:</hi> albeit I tremble to recite so monstrous and vile a fact; yet that every man <note place="margin">Contempt of Sacraments, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 34.</note> might see how deadly besotted those sort of people are that give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves over to Satan, and with what power of errour he overwhelmeth them, and beside, how full of malice this uncleane spirit is, that as it were in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight of God, would prophane the holy Sacrament of Baptisme. This good holy Curate, after he had consecrated the holy host, gave it also to the toade to eat, and afterward restored it to the Witch again, who killing the toade, and cutting it in pieces, with other such like sorceries, caused a young wench to carry it secretly into the Farmers house, and to put it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the table as they were at dinner; whereupon immediately the Farmer and his children that were at the table fell suddenly sicke, and three dayes after died: the Witch her selfe being detected, was burned, but the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate suffered onely a little imprisonment in the Bishop of Paris house, and that not long for what with friendship and money he was soone delivered. <hi>Froissard,</hi> who was Treasurer and Canon of Chymay, reporteth of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Curate in the countrey of Beare (under <hi>Charles</hi> the seventh) that had a familiar spirit which hee called <hi>Orthon:</hi> whose helpe hee used to the disturbance of the Lord of Corosse, by causing a terrible noise to bee heard every night by him and his servants in his castle, because the said Lord withheld his tythes from him, and converted them to his owne use.</p>
               <p>In the yiare 1530, at Nuremburg a certaine Priest studied Art Magick, <note place="margin">Wierus.</note> and being very covetous of gold and silver, the Devill (whom hee served) shed him through a Chrystall certaine treasures hidden in the city: he by and by (greedy of this rich prey) went to that part of the city where hee supposed it to have lien buried: and being arrived at the place, with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion whom he brought to this pretty pastime, fell a searching and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging up a hollow pit, untill he perceived a coffer that lay in the bottome of the hole, with a great blacke dog lying by it: whither he was no sooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, but the earth fell downe and filled up the hole, and smothered and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed him to death. So this poore Priest was entrapped and rewarded by his master no otherwise than he deserved; but otherwise than he expected or looked for.</p>
               <p>Howbeit they are not onely simple Priests and Friers that deale with <note place="margin">Naucler. vinc. &amp;c.</note> these cursed Arts, but even Popes themselves. <hi>Silvester</hi> the second (as <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> and others report) was first a conjuring Frier, and gave himselfe to the Devill upon condition he might be Pope, as he was indeed; and having obtained his purpose, as it seemed he began earnestly to desire to know the day wherein he should die: which also his Schoolmaster the Devill revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto him, but under such doubtfull tearmes, that he dreamed in his foolish conceit, of immortality, and that he should never die. It chanced on a time as he was singing Masse at Rome in a Temple called Ierusalem (which was the place assigned him to die in) and not Ierusalem in Palestina (as he made himselfe falsly to beleeve, he heard a great noise of Devils that came to fetch him away (note that this was done in Masse while) whereat <note place="margin">A not wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

he being terrified and tormented, and seeing himselfe not able any way to escape, hee desired his people to rend his body in pieces after his death, and lay it upon a charriot, and let horses draw it whither they would; which was accordingly performed: for as soone as he was dead, the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his carkasse were carried out of the Church of Laterane by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked spirit, who as he ruled him in life, so he was the chiefe in his death and funerals.</p>

With this sond and foolish affection (I know not how) our first fathers <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> were tickled and tainted from the beginning, to think to impaire the glory of God: and they also were puffed up with the blast of ambition, that I know not with what fond, foolish, rash, and proud conceit, went about after the floud to build a city and tower of exceeding height, by that means to win same and reputation amongst men: In stead whereof they ought rather <note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> to have praysed God by remembring his gracious goodnesse in their mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous deliverance in their fathers persons, from that generall deluge and shipwracke of the world: but forasmuch as with a proud and high sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke they lifted up themselves against God, to whom all glory onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth, therefore God also set himselfe against them and against their over bold practises, interrupting all their determined presumptuous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, by such a confusion and alteration of tongues which he sent among them, that one could not understand another: so that with shame they were constrained to leave their begun worke.

And thus God resisteth the proud, and favoureth the humble: loe here the punishment wherewith God punished their sin, remaining still upon them this day, for a chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their proud spirits.</p>
               <p>With the staine of this sinne, most commonly, the mightiest Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of this world are defiled, who although both by word and writing avouch and confesse their power to be by the grace of God, yet for the most part they are very unthankfull for the same, and so proud and high minded, that they shew themselves most obstinate and ungratefull of all men: for oftentimes they rob him of the honour and glory which is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar unto himselfe, and attribute it to themselves, in setting forth their brave and sumptuous shewes and triumphs: this is the sinne whereof <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> King of Babell was reproved; for God having bestowed upon him a kingdome with such pompe and renowne, that he made whole nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to tremble before his face, and putting many people in subjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, he (in stead of giving thanks for these great benefits) exalted himselfe, suffering his heart to swell, and his understanding to waxe hard with pride, not regarding the Lord who extolled him so high: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he was constrained to confesse and acknowledge him for the true God, to have an everlasting Kingdome, and an infinite power, as well by the forewarning of dreames which <hi>Daniel</hi> interpreted, as by the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous deliverance of three young men out of the burning furnace; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he walked one day in his royall palace at Babylon, and vaunted of his greatnesse, and magnificence, saying to himselfe, <hi>Is not this great Babell, which I have built for the house of the Kingdome, by the might of my power, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>for the honour of my Majesty?</hi> Now whilest the word was yet in his mouth, a voyce was heard from heaven, saying, <hi>O King, to thee it is spoken, Thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome shall depart from thee:</hi> and according to the tenour of the voyce hee was immediately deposed from his royall seat, spoiled of all his glory, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the society of men, deprived of sense, and made a companion for the bruit beasts, and wilde asses, eating grasse like oxen, even so long, untill his haire was growne stiffe like Eagles feathers, and his nailes like the clawes of birds. In which estate he continued the space of seven yeares; even he that a little before was so proud and arrogant, and he that had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered so many kingdomes and nations, that triumphed over Ierusalem, with the Kings thereof. This is a most excellent looking glasse for Kings to behold the ficklenesse and instability of all their power and pomp, when it pleaseth God to humble and bring them under: there is neither Scepter, Crowne, stay, or strength of man, that is able to hinder and turne aside the hand of the Almighty, the King of Kings, from abasing and weakning the most high and strong of this world, let them be never so brave and jolly, and bringing them into a low, contemptible, and brutish estate.</p>
               <p>Besides this which we have already touched, there is another kinde of pride and presumption most damnable and detestable of all; and it is when a man doth so much forget himselfe, as to seise and take upon him that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which onely appertaineth to God, ascribing to himselfe a certaine

deity. One would hardly thinke that there were any such in the world, so proud as to commit this sinne, did not experience by certaine examples teach us the contrary: As first of all the King of Tyre, whose heart was so exalted with the multitude of riches, and the renowne and greatnesse of his house, that he doubted not to esteeme himselfe a god, and to desire ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and power correspondent thereunto. For which presumption God by <note place="margin">Chap. 28. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</note> the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> reproved him, and threatned his destruction, which afterward came upon him, when by the power of a strange and terrible nation, his goodly godhead was overcome and murthered, feeling indeed that he was no god, as hee supposed, but a man subject to death and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Herod,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Agrippa,</hi> which put <hi>Iames</hi> the brother of <hi>Iohn</hi> to <note place="margin">Acts 12.</note> death, and imprisoned <hi>Peter,</hi> with purpose to make him taste of the same cup, was puffed up with no lesse sacrilegious pride; for being upon a time seated in his throne of judgement, and arrayed in his royall robes, shewing forth his greatnesse and magnificence in the presence of the Embassadors of Tyre and Sidon, that desired to continue in peace with him, as he spake unto them, the people shouted and cryed, That it was the voice of God, and not of man: which titles of honour he disclaimed not, and therefore the Angell of the Lord smote him suddenly, because he gave not the glory to God: so that he was eaten with wormes, and gave up the ghost. <hi>Iosephus</hi> reporteth the same story more at large on this manner: Vpon the second <note place="margin">Iewish Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, <hi>l.</hi> 19. c. 7.</note> day of the solemnization of the playes which <hi>Herod</hi> caused to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Emperours health, there being a great number of Gentlemen and Lords present, that came from all quarters to his feast, he came betime in the morning to the Theatre, clad in a garment all woven with silver of a marvellous workmanship; upon which, as the Sun rising cast his beames, there glittered out such an excellent brightnesse, that thereby his perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious flatterers tooke occasion to call him with a loud voice by the name of God: for the which sacrilegious speech, he not reproving nor forbidding them, was presently taken with most grievous and horrible dolours and gripes in his bowels, so that looking upon the people he uttered these words: Behold here your goodly god, whom you but now so highly hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ready to die with extreame paine. And so he died indeed most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, even when he was in the top of his honour and jollity, and as it were in the midst of his earthly Paradise, being beaten downe and swallowed up with confusion and ignominy, not stricken with the edge of sword or speare (for that had been far more honourable) but gnawne in pieces with lice and vermine.</p>

After his first victory had of <hi>Darius,</hi> and his entrance into Aegypt (which he tooke without blowes, as also he did Rhodes and Cilicia) he practised and suborned the Priests that ministred at the Oracle of <hi>Hammon,</hi> to make him be pronounced and entituled by the Oracle, The sonne of <hi>Iupiter</hi> (which kinde of jugling and deceit was common at that time.) Having obtained this honour, forthwith he caused himselfe to be worshipped as a god, according to the custome of the Kings of Persia: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanted he flatterers about him that egged him forward, and soothed <note place="margin">

It hapned as he warred in India, he received so sore a wound, that with paine thereof he was constrained to say, Though he was the renowned sonne of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> yet he ceased not to feele the infirmities of a weake and diseased body: finally, being returned to Babylon, where many Embassadors of divers farre countries, as of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, and other cities in Africa, Spaine, France, Sicily, Sardinia, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine cities of Italy, were arrived to congratulate his good successe, for the great renowne which by his worthy deeds he had gotten; as he lay there ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his rest many dayes, and bathing himselfe in all kinde of pleasure, one day after a great feast, that lasted a whole day and a night, in a banquet after supper, being ready to returne home, he was poysoned; when before hee had drunke his whole draught, he gave a deep sigh suddenly, as if hee had been thrust through with a dart, and was carried away in a swoone, vexed with such horrible torment, that had he not been restrained, he would have killed himselfe. And on this manner he that could not content himselfe with the condition of a man, but would needs climbe above the clouds, to goe in equipage with God, drunke up his owne death, leaving as sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly all his worldly pompe, as hee had suddenly gotten it: which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished like smoake, none of his children being any whit the better for it.</p>
               <p>There was in Syracusa a city of Sicilia (which is now called Saragosse) a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59545:47"/>
Physitian called <hi>Menecrates,</hi> whose folly and presumption was so great, that he accounted himselfe a god, and desired to be so reputed by others; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he required no other wages and recompence of the patients which he tooke in hand (as <hi>Aelianus</hi> witnesseth) but that they should onely acknowledge him to be <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and call him so, and avow themselves to his service. Vpon a time <hi>Denis</hi> the tyrant, desirous to make some pastime with him, made a feast, and invited him amongst others to be his guest; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was a god, to doe him honour answerable to his name, he placed him at a table all alone, and set before him no dishes, but only a censer with frankincense, which was a proper and convenient service for the gods. This honourable duty pleased the Physitian very well at the first, so that he shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up the perfume most willingly: but when this poore god saw the other guests eating and drinking indeed, and himselfe not being able to be fed with smoake, ready to starve with hunger, arose up and went away all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged in himselfe, and derided of others; having more need to purge his owne braines of their superfluous humor, than others from their sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caligula</hi> the first, Emperor, being become an ordinary despiser and open mocker of all Religion, it came presently in his braine to beleeve (so drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken was he with a draught of his owne foolish conceit) that there was no other God but himselfe; therefore he caused men to worship him, and to kisse his hands or his feet in token of reverence (which honour afterwards the Popes tooke upon them) yea and was so besotted, that he went about by certaine engines of art to counterfeit thunder and lightnings: albeit in all this pride and arrogancy, or rather folly, there was none so timerous and fearefull as he, or that could sooner upon lighter occasion be dismaied. One day as he was by mount Aetna in Sicily, hearing by chance the violent cracking of the flames which all that season ascended out of the top of the hill, it strucke so sudden and horrible a feare into him, that he never ceased flying all night till he came to Phar in Messina. Every little thunderclap put him in feare of death, for he would leap up and downe like a mad man when he heard it thunder; finding himselfe not able by his god head to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himselfe from the power thereof: but if there chanced greater cracks than ordinary, then would not his hot bed hold him, but needs must he run into the cold floore underneath the bed, to hide himselfe. Thus was hee compelled against his will to feare him whom willingly he would not deigne to acknowledge. And thus it falleth out with all wicked miserable Atheists, whose hearts imagine there is no God; and therefore have so little assurance in themselves, that there need no thunder and lightening to amase them; for the shaking of every leafe is sufficient to make them trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: To conclude, this Atheist, void of all Religion and feare of God, and full of all prophanenesse, was according to his due desert, murthered by one of his servants: of the which will follow more at large in the next booke.</p>
               <p>

invented a tricke whereby to present to the eare and eye, the ratling and swift shine of both thunder and lightning; that by that means astonishing his subjects, he might be esteemed of them for a god: but it chanced that his house being set on fire by true lightning, and overthrowne with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent strength of tempestuous rain, together with the overflowing of a pond that stood neer, he perished by fire and water, burnt and drowned, and all at once.</p>

By which dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of theirs, they verifie in themselves that which the Scripture speaketh of Antichrist, which is the man of sinne, the sonne of perdition, an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, <note place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 3.</note> and one that exalteth himselfe against all which is called God, or which is worshipped, till he be set as a God in the Temple of God, shewing himselfe that he is God. Wherefore also the heavy vengeance of God is manifest upon them, by the great and horrible punishments they have been tormented with: for some of them have had their eyes pulled out; others have dyed in prisons; a third sort have bin smothered to death; a fourth hath bin killed with the sword; a fifth hath died with hunger; a sixth hath been stoned; a seventh poysoned; and yet there hath not wanted an eighth sort, whom the Devill himselfe hath stifled.</p>

an Hereticke, a Symonist, and a Manslayer, it was agreed upon by a joint consent, that the King should doe no more obeisance, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as nothing worth, whatsoever he should impose. Wherefore the King to tame his proud and malitious nature, dispatched secretly two hundred men at armes under the conduct of one Captaine <hi>Noguard,</hi> towards Avian in Naples (whither his Holinesse was fled for feare of divers whose houses and castles he had caused to be rased downe) there to surprise him on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: which stratagem they speedily performed, and carried him prisoner to Rome, where he died most miserably. <hi>Peter Mesie</hi> a Spanish Gentleman of Sevill, saith in many of his Lectures, that he died in prison inraged with famine. <hi>Nicholas Gilles</hi> in his first volume of French Chronicles reporteth, that he died in the castle Saint Angelo, through a fluxe of his belly, which cast him into a frenzy, that he gnew off his owne hands, and that at the houre of his death there were heard horrible thunders, and tempests, and lightenings round about: this is he in whose honour this fine Epitaph was made: <hi>Intravit ut Vulpes, regnavit ut Leo, mortuus est ut Canis, He entred like</hi>

               <p>If it be so therefore, that no man ought to arrogate to himselfe any title of deity, then consequently it is no lesse unlawfull to give that divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to any other mortall creature; and therefore the people of Caesarea faulted greatly, when blasphemously they called King <hi>Herod</hi> a god, as hath been declared before.

And thus the Romanes in time of <hi>Tiberius</hi> consecrating <note place="margin">Tertullian Apolog.</note> to themselves a whole legion, even thousands of false gods, would not admit of the true God, and his Sonne Christ, but rejected him above all others.</p>
               <p>Among all the vanities of the Athenians, this was one worthy noting, how they ordained, that <hi>Demetrius, Alexanders</hi> successor (for re-establishing their popular and antient liberty) with his father <hi>Antigonus,</hi> should be called Kings, and honoured with the title of Saving gods, and to have a Priest that should offer sacrifice unto them: and moreover caused their pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures to be drawne in the same banner where the pictures of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi> (the protectors of their city) were drawne in broidered worke: but this goodly banner as it was carried about in procession, was rent in

pieces by a tempestuous storme that arose suddenly. God thereby mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing how odious and displeasant both this new and old superstition was in his sight: besides that, doe but consider the laudable vertues that so commended this new god <hi>Demetrius,</hi> to make them honour him in such sort; they were violence and cruelties, intemperance, with all inordinate lasciviousnesse, villanies, and whoredomes: so that it was no marvell if they had made him a god, being unworthy altogether of humane society. This new found god having gotten a great victory by sea, as he triumphed and braved it with ships after the same, was so shattered with a sudden tempest, that the greatest part of his navy went to wrecke, and afterwards was vanquished by <hi>Seleuchus</hi> in a battell, wherein his father <hi>Antigonus</hi> was slaine: and when he thought to returne to Athens, they shut their gates upon him, whom a little before they had canonized for a god: for which cause he raised war against them, and so wearied them with onsets on each side, and so inclosed them both by sea and land, that being brought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame famine and necessity, they were compelled to entertain him again, and to behold the horrible outrages of their owne made god, to their griefe and confusion. But not long after, <hi>Seleuchus</hi> once againe damped his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, insomuch that having lived three yeares in a countrey of Syria, like a banished outlaw; for feare to be delivered into his hands, and weary of his owne life, he stuffed himselfe so with food, that he burst in pieces. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let every man learne by these examples, not to translate the honour and majesty of God to any creature, but to leave it to him alone, who is jealous thereof, and will not (as the Prophet saith) give his glory unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

Therefore they
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59545:50"/>
that would perswade themselves that this glorious heaven and massy earth wanted a guider and a governour, have their understanding blinded from fight of things manifest, and their hearts perverted from all shew of reason: for is there any substance in this world that bath no cause of his subsisting? Is there a day without a Sun? Are there fruit and no trees? Plants and no seeds? Can it raine without a cloud? Be a tempest without winde? Can a ship sayle without a Pylot? Or a house be built without a Carpenter or builder? If then every part of this world hath his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cause of being and dependance, is it likely that the whole is without cause to be to it a furnishing and government? Say, you hogs and dogs, doe you not beleeve that which you see? or if your eyes be bored out that you cannot see, must you thinke there is no Sunne nor light, because your eyes are in darknesse and blindnesse? Can you behold all the secrets of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Is there nothing but a voice, a singing of birds, or an harmonious consort of musicall instruments in the world? And yet who perceiveth these small things? Can you behold the winde? Can you see the sweet smell of fragrant flowers along the fields? Can you see the secrets of your owne bodies, your entrailes, your heart and your braine? And yet you cease not to beleeve that there are such things, except you be heartlesse and brainlesse indeed: Why then doe you measure God by your own sight, and doe not beleeve there is a God, because he is invisible, since that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesteth himselfe more apparently both to understanding and sence, than either voice, smell or winde? Doe not your owne oathes, blasphemies, and horrible cursings beare witnesse against you, when you sweare by, despight and maugre him whom you deny to be? Doth not every thunderclap con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine you to tremble at the blast of his voyce? If any calamity approach neere unto or light upon you, or if death be threatned or set before your eyes, doe not you then feele, in spight of all your reason, that the severe judgement of God doth waken up your dull and sleepy conscience to come to his tryall? There was never yet any nation or people so barbarous, which by the perswasion and instinct of nature hath not alwayes beleeved a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine deity, and to thinke otherwise is not only a derestable thing, but also most absurd, and so contrary to humane reason, that the very Paynims have very little tolerated such horrible blasphemy.

How much more then is the state of Christendome at this day to be lamented, which we see in many places infected with such a contagious pestilence, that divers men invenomed with this deadly poison, are so mischievous and wretched, as to make roome for Atheisme, by forbidding and hindering by all means possible, the course of the Gospell: wherein they make known what they are, and what zeale they beare to the religion and service of God, and with what affection they are led towards the good and safety of the commonwealth, and what hereafter is to be hoped of him: for where there

Oh stinking and cursed throat to belch out such monstrous blasphemy! doe not these speeches bewray a villanous and abhominable Atheist, if ever any were? Is not this to declare himselfe openly to be Antichrist? For he is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ which denieth Iesus to be Christ, and which denieth <hi>the Father and the Sonne,</hi> according as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith. Albeit in the meane while this cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">1 Iohn 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22.</note> caitife, that had as much religion as a dog, made shew to be the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and defender of the Catholicke Faith, making warre with all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer against Christ Iesus in the person of his servant <hi>Luther.</hi> Now after he had by his pardons and indulgences drawne out a world of money, and heaped up great treasures by the maintenance of courtizans and whores, and had enriched his bastards, one day being at meat, he received newes of the overthrow of the French in Lombardy, whereat hee rejoyced out of measure, and for that good tidings doubled his good cheare; suddenly he was constrained to turne his copy from joy into sadnesse, from pleasure into griefe and gnashing of teeth, by a most bitter and unlooked for death, which deprived him at once of all his pleasures, to make him drink the cup of Gods fierce wrath, and to throw him downe headlong into everlasting paines and torments which were provided for him. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Martin</hi> of Belay in his second booke of memorable things) hearing of the great losse which the Frenchmen sustained at Milan, tooke so great joy thereat, that a catarrhe and an ague ensuing, killed him within three dayes after; a happy man indeed to die with joy.</p>

               <p>To bring the matter to an end, I will here set downe a notable and strange thing that chanced in the raigne of <hi>Lewis</hi> the ninth (as <hi>Enguerran de Monstrelet</hi> in his second volume of Histories recordeth it) upon the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of Iune in the yeare of our Lord God 1464, there happened a strange thing in the Palace at Paris: So it was, that there was a matter in law to be tried betwixt the Bishop of Angiers, and a rich citicen, whom the Bishop charged to have spoken before many witnesses, that he beleeved not that there was either God or Devill, Heaven or Hell. Now whilst the Bishops Lawyer laid to his charge these things, the place began to tremble very much wherein they were, and a stone fell downe from the roof amongst them all, without hurting any; yet every man was sore afraid, and departed out of the house untill the morrow; then the matter was begun againe to be pleaded, which was no sooner in hand, but the chamber began afresh to shake, and one of the summers came forth of his mortisehole, falling down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards two foot, and there stayed: so that all that were within the hall loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

to have been slaine outright, ran out so violently, that some left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them their caps, others their hoods, others their slippers: summarily, glad was he that could get out first; neither durst they plead any more causes in that place untill it were mended. Thus much reporteth <hi>Enguerran,</hi> without mention of any decision of that matter. Now forasmuch as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing happeneth by chance, it is most likely that God by that accident would give us to understand, both how monstrous and detestable all such speeches are, as also how men ought to feare and abhorre them, seeing that the dumbe and sencelesse creatures, and wood, beams, planks, and stones, and the earth it self (by nature stedfast and fixed) are so far from enduring them, that they are moved withall.</p>

Now Satan himselfe was there in a mans shape (as commonly he is never far from such meetings) and bought it againe of the other at the same price, and by and by bad him give him his soule; the whole company affirming it was meet he should have it, since he had bought it, not perceiving the Devill: but presently he laying hold of this souleseller, carried him into the aire before them all, toward his own habitation, to the great astonishment and amase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the beholders; and from that day to this he was never heard of, but tryed to his pain that men had soules, and that hell was no fable, according to his godlesse and prophane opinion.</p>

But ere long his impiety was justly revenged; for the Lord struck him with such a strange disease, that out of his body issued such a slimy and filthy sweat, and engendred such a number of lice and wormes, that his bowels being consumed by them, he died most miserably.</p>
               <p>At Hambourgh not long since there lived an impious wretch, that despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">Theatr. histor.</note> the preaching of the Gospell, and the Ministers thereof, accounting it as a vaine thing not worthy the beleeving of any man: neither did he thus himself only; but also seduced many others, bringing them all to Atheisme and ungodlinesse. Wherefore the Lord justly recompenced him for his impiety: for he that before had no sence nor feeling of God in his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, being touched with the finger of the Almighty, grew to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, even to too much feeling and knowledge of God, that he fell into extreme despaire, affirming now his sinnes to be past forgivenesse, because
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59545:52"/>
he had withdrawne others from the truth, as well as himselfe, whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought himselfe guilty of no sinne; and that God was so just, that he would not forgive him, whereas before he thought there was no God (so mighty is the operation of the Lord when he pleaseth to touch the conscience of man) finally, continuing in this desperate case, he threw himselfe from the roofe of a house into a well, and not finding water enough to drowne him, he thrust his head into the bottome thereof, till he had made an end of his life.</p>
               <p>In the yeare of our Lord 1502 there lived one <hi>Hermannus Biswicke,</hi> a <note place="margin">Theatr. histor.</note> grand Atheist, and a notable instrument of Satan, who affirmed, that the world never had beginning, as foolish <hi>Moses</hi> dreamed: and that there was neither Angels, nor devils, nor hell, nor future life, but that the soules of men perished with their bodies: besides, that Christ Iesus was nothing else but a seducer of the people; and that the faith of Christians, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever else is contained in holy writs, was meere vanity. These articles full of impiety and blasphemy, he constantly avouched to the death; and for the same cause was together with his books burnt in Holland.</p>
               <p>A certaine rich man at Holberstadium abounding with all manner of earthly commodities, gave himselfe so much to his pleasure, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <note place="margin">Theatr. histor.</note> besotted therewith; in such sort, that he made no reckoning of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, nor any good thing, but dared to say, that if he might lead such a life continually upon earth, he would not envy heaven, nor desire any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change. Notwithstanding ere long (contrary to his expectation) the Lord cut him off by death, and so his desired pleasure came to an end: but after his death there appeared such diabolicall apparitions in his house, that no man daring to inhabite it, it became desolate: for every day there appeared the Image of this Epicure sitting at a board, with a number of his ghests, drinking, carousing, and making good cheare; and his table furnished with delicates, and attended on by many that ministred necessaries unto them, beside with minstrels, trumpetters, and such like. In summe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he delighted in, in his life time, was there to be seene every day. The Lord permitting Satan to bleare mens eyes with such strange shewes, to the end that others might be terrified from such Epicurisme and impiety.</p>
               <p>Not inferior to any of the former in Atheisme and impiety, and equall to all in manner of punishment, was one of our owne nation, of fresh and late memory, called <hi>Marlin,</hi> by profession a scholler, brought up from his <note place="margin">Marl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But see what a hooke the Lord put in the nostrils of this barking dogge: so it fell out, that as he purposed to stab one whom he ought a grudge unto, with his dagger, the other party perceiving, so avoyded the stroke, that withall catching hold of his wrest, he stabbed his owne dagger into his own head; in such sort, that notwithstanding all the means of surgery that could be wrought, he shortly after died thereof: the manner of his death being so
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59545:52"/>
terrible (for he even cursed and blasphemed to his last gaspe, and together with his breath an oath flew out of his mouth) that it was not onely a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest signe of Gods judgement, but also an horrible and fearefull terrour to all that beheld him. But herein did the justice of God most notably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, in that he compelled his own hand which had written those blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to be the instrument to punish him, and that in his braine, which had devised the same.</p>
               <p>Another also of our owne nation is not to be overpassed, who for an Atheist and an Epicure might compare with any of the former, and for the judgement of God upon him doth give place to none. It was a gentleman of Barkshire, whose name I forbeare to expresse, a man of great possessions. This man was an open contemner of God and all Religion, a profest Atheist, and a scorner of the Word of God and Sacraments; insomuch, as I have heard reported of very credible persons, being a witnesse at the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising of a childe, he would needs have it called <hi>Beelzebub.</hi> Besides this, he was given over to all sensuality of the flesh, keeping in his house continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally notorious strumpets, and that openly without shame: his mouth was so accustomed to swearing, that he could scarse speake without an oath. This miserable man, or rather beast, having continued long in this damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble course of life, at last Gods heavy vengeance found him out: for upon a certain day riding abroad a hunting with another companion, as they were discoursing of many vaine matters, it pleased Almighty God of a sudden to strike him with sudden death: for falling suddenly to the crupper of his horse backward, he was taken downe starke dead, with his tongue hanging out of his mouth after a fearfull manner, and became a terrible example to all wicked Atheists, of Gods justice.</p>
               <p>Hither I might adde the examples of others, who having been in high places of favour in former times, are fallen like <hi>Lucifer</hi> from their heaven, that is, their worldly felicity, and live like him in chaines of imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. These had wont (being in their bravery) to mocke at all Religion, and to make themselves merry with scoffing at the holy Scripture, but the Lord hath brought them downe, and plucked the feathers of their pride, to teach them to know there is a God, and that Religion is no matter of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, but Gods owne ordinance, to bring men to blessednesse; and let them be assured, if they repent not, the Lord will yet further execute his venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon them, and make them more manifest spectacles of his justice.</p>
               <p>Many more moderne and home-bred examples I could adde; of some that were hanged, some that died desperate, some that were deprived of their senses, having been notorious Atheists and Epicures in their lives; but I hope these already named are sufficient to prove, that the Lord of heaven observeth the wayes of men, and rewardeth every man according to his works, especially such as strive to deny his Essence-or his sonne Christ. I would to God (and I pray it from my heart) that all Atheists in this Realme, and in the world beside, would by the remembrance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of these examples either forsake their horrible impiety, or that they might in like manner come to destruction; and so that abominable sin which so flourisheth amongst men of greatest name, might either be quite extinguished and rooted out, or at least smothered and kept under, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But before we proceed, wee must know, that as it is required of us by the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, to hold God for our true and onely God, to repose all our whole trust and confidence in him, and call upon him, serve and worship him alone; so in the second to this the contrary to this is forbidden; which is, to doe any manner of service, honour, and reverence by devotion to Idols, forasmuch he is a Spirit (that is to say, of a spirituall nature and Essence, which is infinite and incomprehensible) so loveth he a spirituall <note place="margin">Iohn 4.</note> worship and service, which is answerable to his nature, and not by Images and pictures, and such other outward and corruptible means, which he hath in no wise commanded: wherefore <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet reproving the folly and vanity of Idolaters, saith, <hi>To whom will you liken God, or what similitude will you set up unto him:</hi> Therefore if it be not Gods will, that under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and colour of his owne name, any Image or picture should be adored (being a thing not only inconvenient, but also absurd and unseemly) much lesse can hee abide to have them worshipped under the name and title of any creature whatsoever.

Howbeit for all this, the same people not long after, fell back into the same sin, and bowed themselves befere strange gods, and through the allurements of the daughters of <hi>Moab,</hi> joyned themselves to <hi>Belphegor:</hi>

               <p>And albeit that after all this, being brought by him into the land of promise, he had forbidden and threatned them, for cleaving to the Idols of the nations, whose land they possessed, yet were they so prone to Idolatry, that notwithstanding all this, they fell to serve <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Astaroth:</hi> wherefore the fire of Gods wrath was inflamed against them, and he gave them over

               <p>Now albeit these examples may seeme to have some affinity with Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie, yet because the ignorance and rudenesse of the people was rather the cause of their falling away from God, than any wilfull affection that raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them, therefore we place them in this ranke, as well as they have bin alwaies brought up and nuzled in Idolatry.</p>

               <p>And to be short, Idolatry hath been the decay and ruine of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Iuda, as at all other times, so especially under <hi>Ioachas</hi> sonne of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi>

               <p>And not long after, it was utterly destroyed by the forces of <hi>Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> King of Babel, that came against Ierusalem and tooke it, and carried <note place="margin">2 Kings 24. 25</note> King <hi>Ioachim</hi> with his mother, his Princes, his servants, and the treasurers of the Temple, and his owne house, into Babylon; and finally tooke <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dechias</hi> that fled away, and before his eyes caused his sonnes to be slaine: which as soone as he had beheld, commanded them also to be pulled out, and so binding him in chaines of yron, carried him prisoner to Babylon; putting all the Princes of Iudah to the sword, consuming with fire the Temple, with the Kings Palace, and all the goodly buildings of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. And thus the whole kingdome (though by an especiall prerogative, consecrated and ordained of God himselfe) ceased to be a kingdome, and came to such an end, that it was never re-established by God: it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell then if the like hapned to the kingdome of Israel, which was after a sort begun and confirmed by the filthy idolatry of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> calves, which as his successors maintained or favoured more or lesse, so were they expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">

And this againe usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the crowne, enjoyed it but seven dayes, at the end whereof (seeing himselfe in danger in the city of Tirza, taken by <hi>Amri,</hi> whom the people had chosen for their King) went into the palace of the Kings house, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himselfe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Above all, a most notable and manifest example of Gods judgement was seene in the death of <hi>Iezabel</hi> his wife, that had been his spurre and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voker to all mischiefe, when by her Eunuchs and most trusty servants, at the commandement of <hi>Iehu,</hi> she was throwne downe out of a window, and trampled under the horse feet, and last of all devoured of dogs. Moreover, the greatest number of the kings of Israel that succeeded him, were mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered one after another: so that the kingdome fell to such a low decline, that it became first tributary to the King of Assyria, and afterward invaded and subverted by him, and the inhabitants transported into his land, whence they never returned, but remained scattered here and there like vagabonds, and all for their abhominable Idolatry. Which ought to be a lesson to all people, Princes, and Kings, that seeing that God spared not these two Realmes of Iuda and Israel, but destroyed and rooted them out from the earth, much lesse will he spare any other kingdome and Monarchy which continue by their Images and Idol-worship, to stirre up his indignation against them.</p>

For be it the Image either of Prophet, Apostle, or Christ Iesus himselfe, yet it is necessary that the law of God stand whole and sound, which saith, <hi>Thou shalt make thy selfe no graven Image, nor any likenesse of things either in heaven above, or in earth beneath, thou shalt not how downe to them, nor worship them, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore he performed the part of a good Bishop, that finding a vaile spread in the entrance of a Church dore, wherein the Image of <note place="margin">

words, <hi>That it was against the authority of the sacred Scriptures, to have any Image of Christ set up in the Church.</hi> After the same manner, <hi>Serenus</hi> Bishop of Marscilla, beat downe and banished all Images out of his Churches, as occasions of Idolatry: and to shun them the more, it was ordained in the Elibertine Councell, that no Image nor picture should be set up in any Church: for which cause also the Emperour <hi>Leo</hi> the third, by an open Edict commanded his subjects to cast out of their Temples all pictures <note place="margin">

After which time, when Images were recalled into Greece and into Constantinople (the chiefe city and seat of the East Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire) it came to passe by a great and dreadfull (yet just) judgement of God, that this famous and renowned city, in the worlds eye impregnable, after long siege, and great and furious assaults) was at length taken by the Turks, who having won the breach, and entred with fury, drove the poore Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Palaeologus</hi> (even till then fighting for the cities defence) to that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that in retyring among the prease of his own souldiers, he was thron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and trampled to death; and his slain body being found, was beheaded, and his head contemptuously caried about the city upon a launce. Now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the massacre of many thousand men, to make up a compleat, &amp; absolute cruelty, they drew the Empresse with her daughters and many other ladies and gentlewomen to a banquet, where after many vile and horrible wrongs and disgraces, they killed and tore them in pieces in most monstrous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. In all which, the execution of Gods most just wrath for Idolatry did most lively appeare: which sinne, accompanied with many other execrable and vile vices, must needs draw after it a grievous and terrible punishment, to serve for example to others that were to come: neither was it a thing by chance, or hap-hazzard, that the Christians were made a mocking stock to them in that wofull day, when in their bloudy triumphs they caused a Crucifix to be carried through the streets in contempt, and throwing durt upon it, cried in their Language, <hi>This is the gallant god of Christians.</hi> And thus did God license and permit these savage Turks to commit every day grievous outrages, and to make great wasts and desolations in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, till that they grew so mighty, that it is to be feared lest the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">

Whereof we have a pittifull example in the overthrow of the French army, which <hi>Iohn</hi> the sonne of <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of Burgondy led against the Turke <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and by the treachery and cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise of the Hungarians, who in the time of battell turned their backs and fled, was overcome: in that this wicked and cruell Tygre expresly charged,

               <p>Besides these generall calamities, the Lord hath particularly shewne forth his indignation against private persons and places for Idolatry: as in Spoletium at one time there perished by an earthquake three hundred and <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Nicephorus lib.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 27.</note> charge to destroy it) thought it a thing almost unpossible, by reason of the strength of the wals, and matter of it; <hi>Marcellus</hi> the Bishop undertook the labour, and found out a man that promised to shake and root up the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it by fire; but when he had put it in practise, a blacke Devill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared and hindred the naturall operation of the fire: which when <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> perceived, he by earnest and zealous prayer drove away the Devill, and so the fire rekindled and consumed it to nothing. In all which examples we may see the wonderfull indignation of God against Idoll-worshippers when by such strange and extraordinary means he bringeth them to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And this doubtlesse is no new course, for even since the beginning of the world (if we consult Histories) we shall finde, that well nigh all the kingdomes, places, persons, and countries that have been any wise infected with this sinne, have still come to some ruine or other, and to some great overthrow, and their Idolatry suppressed by some notable and strange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. Whereof Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> may be a witnesse, who affirmeth, That when Iesus being a childe was carried into Aegypt for feare of <hi>Herod,</hi> all the Idols of Aegypt fell downe, and all their miracles became mute, which the Prophet <hi>Isaias</hi> foreseeing, saith, <hi>Behold, the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Isay 19. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>and shall come into Aegypt, and the Idols of Aegypt shall melt in the midst of her.</hi> Besides, the generall silence of the Devill in his Oracles throughout the world presently upon Christs Incarnation, is a thing known and confessed of all men. Notwithstanding all which, the holy Pope will still maintain his Idolatry, albeit the Lord hath made manifest tokens of his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against it. As appeareth by that which happened in the yeare 1451, being the Popes Iubile, when such a concourse of people was made from all quarters of the world to honour that superstitious day: for the people being upon <hi>Adrians</hi> bridge, were so thrust together, that two hundred men and three horses lost their lives, being trampled upon and stifled to death: many fell into the water over the bridge, and so perished; of whom an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty were buried at Saint <hi>Celsus.</hi> And these are the fruits of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59545:55"/>
their Indulgences, which are too much bought and sought for, and of their Iubilies, proceeding from the Bishop of Rome his impious and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious zeale. Now to eschew these and such like misfortunes; the true and onely meanes is, an unfained diversion from all Idolatry and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, and whatsoever else contrarieth the pure service of God, and a conversation unto him, to serve him in spirit and truth, as the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow seeing that God hath set downe a certaine forme of doctrine and instruction, according to which hee would have us to serve him, and established a kinde of discipline to be observed and maintained of every man inviolably, it behoveth therefore every Christian to conforme himselfe unto this order; and not to be guided by every fickle imagination of his own braine, or every rash presumption that ariseth in himselfe, but onely by the direct rule of Gods Word, which onely we ought to follow. By meanes of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting which duty, many vaine and pernitious ceremonies and strange superstitions have beene brought in and swayed mightily: by reason whereof great Controversies and Disputations are taken up at this day. Albeit indeed it be a thing manifest, that being not grounded and prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon the Anchor of the Scriptures, they ought to be abolished, what brave outward shew in appearance soever they beare.</p>
               <p>And that they set abroach things are not blamelesse and excusable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, it appeareth by the punishment of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> who being <note place="margin">Levit 20. Numb 34.</note> ordained Priests of God, to sacrifice and offer onely those things which were commanded in the Law, yet were so evill advised as to offer strange incense and perfume upon the Altar, received at the very instant of the fact condigne punishment for their presumption: for suddenly this their strange fire invaded them so fiercely, and so piercingly, that they were soon burned and consumed therewith: and so they were not spared, albeit they were <hi>Aarons</hi> sonnes, even his first borne, and <hi>Moses</hi> Nephewes; that by them all other might feare and take warning how to enterprise any thing in Gods service contrary to his expresse Ordinance.</p>
               <p>This moderation also ought to be observed in the Church Discipline, to wit, that every man containe himselfe within the Precincts of his voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that none intrude themselves into any charge without being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of God thereunto: whereof <hi>Corah</hi> greatly faulted, when being not <note place="margin">Numb. 16.</note> content with the dignity of a Levites office which God had bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he ambitiously aspired to the Priests office, and besides this stirred up and drew to his faction <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and many others, to the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59545:56"/>
number of two hundred and fifty persons, against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> but he drew withall the vengeance of God downe upon himselfe and all that tooke his part in most horrible and fearefull manner: for some of them, to wit, the two hundred and fifty, who, notwithstanding <hi>Moses</hi> reproose, were so hardy and presumptuous as to present themselves the next morrow after the tumult, openly before the Tabernacle, to offer Incense, as if they had beene true Priests, were for their flame of Ambition and Pride, set on fire and consumed with the flame of Gods wrath: others, to wit, <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> for their audacious enterprise against God, in the person of his servants, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and their high mindednesse and rebellion, in not comming out of their Tents at the commandment of <hi>Moses,</hi> were throwne downe into the lowest pit, the earth opening her mouth, and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them up alive with their Tents and Families, and all that belonged unto them, to the fearefull amasement of the whole people, that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of this Spectacle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oziah</hi> King of Iuda, carried himselfe a long while uprightly and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly <note place="margin">2 Chron. 26.</note> in the service of God: but after God had given him many great victories over his enemies the Philistims, the Arabians, the Amorites, and that his renowne and feare was spread not onely to his neighbours, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to strange nations, by and by his heart was puft up with pride and selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit, that he dared to enter the Temple of God, and burne Incense up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar, which belonged onely to the Priests office to doe: and not obeying the strong resistance and countermand of the good Priests that had charge of the Temple, he was strucken with a Leprosie, and hastily carried out and sequestred from the society of men all his life time. And so this proud King that foolishly tooke upon him more than was lawfull and convenient, was forced to recoile, and to be still, being humbled under so grievous a scourge as never for sooke him till his death.</p>
               <p>When the Arke of the Covenant was in bringing from <hi>Abinadabs</hi> house <note place="margin">1 Sam. 6: 1 Chron. 13.</note> in Kyriathjarim, in a Cart guided by <hi>Vzza</hi> and <hi>Ahio, Abinadabs</hi> sonnes, it fell out on the way, that it being shaken by the Oxen, (unfit Servitors for such a worke) <hi>Vzza</hi> put forth his hand to hold it; but therein hee went beyond his charge, and therefore was punished forthwith with present death, for his inconsiderate rashnesse: for albeit he was both a Levite, and thought no evill in his heart, yet in no respect was be licenced to touch the Arke, being a thing lawfull for the Priests onely. Let therefore every one be advised by these Examples, to follow the rule in serving God, that is by him designed, in all simplicity, modestie, and obedience, without altering or declining, or undertaking any thing above or beside their calling.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He third Commandement (which is, <hi>Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vaine)</hi> is first and especially broken by Perjury, when God is so lightly esteemed, nay, so despised, that without any regard had to his Name, that is to say, to his Greatnesse, Majesty, Power, Divine vertue, and fearefull Iustice, (for these bee his names) men by fraud and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice abuse their Oathes, either in denying that which is true, or affirming that which is untrue, or neglecting their promises made and vowed to others: for this is neither to have respect unto his presence, who is every where, nor reverence to his Majestie, who is God of Heaven and Earth, but rather to make him beare witnesse to our lye and falshood; as if he approved it, or had no power to revenge the injury and dishonour done to him. And therefore against such, in threatning words he denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth judgement, that <hi>He will not hold him guiltlesse that taketh his Name in vaine.</hi> Howbeit very many over-boldly give themselves over to this sinne, making little or no conscience to cousen one another even by forswear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: whereby they give most cleare evidence against themselves, that they have very little feare of God before their eyes, and are not guided by any other rule save of their owne affections by which they square out and build their oathes, and pull them done againe at their pleasures; for let it be a matter of vantage, and then they will keepe them, but straightway if a contrary perswasion come in their braine, they will cancell them by and by: wherein they deale farre worse and more injuriously with God, than with their knowne enemies; for he that contrary to his sworne faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth his enemy, declareth that therein he feareth him, but feareth not God; and careth for him, but contemneth God. It was therefore not without good reason that all antiquity ever marked them with the coat of infamy that forswore themselves. And thereupon it is that <hi>Homer</hi> so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten taunteth the Trojans by reason of their so usuall Perjuries. The Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diod. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> had them in detestation as prophane persons, and reputed it so Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall a crime, that whosoever was convinced thereof was punished by death. The ancient Romanes reverenced nothing more then faith in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like affaires, for which cause they had in their Citie a Temple dedicated to it: wherein for a more strait bond they used solemnely to promise and sweare to all the conditions of Peace, Truces, and Bargaines, which they made, and to curse those which went about first to breake them: for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter solemnity and confirmation hereof, they were accustomed at those times to offer sacrifices to the image of faith for more reverence sake. Hence it was that <hi>Attilius Regulus,</hi> chiefe Captaine of the Romane Army against the Carthaginians, was so highly commended of all men, because when he was overcome and taken prisoner, and sent to Rome, he onely for his oathes sake which he had sworne, returned againe to the enemy, albeit hee knew what grievous torments were provided for him at his returne.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59545:57"/>
Others also that came with him, though they were intreated, and by their Parents, Wives, and Allies, instantly urged not to returne to <hi>Hannibals</hi> Campe, could in no wise be moved thereunto: but because they had sworne to the enemie, if the Romans did not accord to those conditions which were offered, to come againe, they preferred the bond and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their promised faith, though accompanied with perpetuall capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, before their private commodities, and neerest linke of affection. But two of these ten (for so many were they) falsified their oath, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mist they might cast to darken and disguise their Perjury with, yet were they condemned of all men for cowards, and faint-hearted Traytors: insomuch that the Censors also nored them with infamy for the fact; whereat they tooke such griefe and inward sorrow, that being weary of their lives, they slew themselves. Now what can they pretend that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse themselves Christians and Catholickes, to excuse their Perjuries, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the very Heathen cry out so loud and cleere, That an oath and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cic. offic. lib.</hi> 1.</note> faith is so sacredly to be kept towards our enemies? This is one of the greatest vertues and commendations which the Psalmist attributeth to the faithfull man, &amp; him that feareth God, and whom God avoucheth for his owne, <hi>Not to falsifie his oath that he sweareth, though it be to his dammage.</hi> The <note place="margin">Psal. 15. Iosh 9.</note> Gibeonites although they were so execrable a people, that for their great and horrible wickednesses and ahominations they might be well esteemed for Hereticks, yet the Princes of Israel, after they had sworne and given their faith unto them, would in no wise retract or goe against their oath, albeit, therein they were deceived by them, for feare of incurring the wrath of God, that suffereth not a Perjurer to goe unpunished. Vpon what ground or example of holy Scripture then may that Doctrine of the Councell of Constance be founded, the purport whereof is, That a man ought not to keepe his faith with Hereticks? I omit to speake how these good Fathers (by Hereticks) meant those men who fearing God, relyed themselves upon his Word, and rejected the foolish and superstitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of men. And under what colour can the Popes usurpe this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to quit and discharge subjects of their oath wherewith they are bound to their Superiors? yet this was the impious audacity of Pope <hi>Zacharia,</hi> Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8, and Pope <hi>Benedict de la Lune,</hi> who freed the Frenchmen from their duty and obedience which they ought unto their <note place="margin">Platina.</note> Kings. In like manner disgorged <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7 his choler and spight against the Emperour <hi>Henry,</hi> by forbidding his Subjects to be his Subjects, <note place="margin">Enguerran de Monstrelet.</note> and to yeeld that obedience unto him which Subjects were bound to doe.</p>
               <p>How be it if an oath be made either against God, or to the damage and hurt of our neighbour (it being for that cause unlawfull) it behoveth us to know that we ought to revoke it, lest wee fall into the sinne of <hi>Saul</hi> and <note place="margin">1 Sam. 14. Marc. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Herod.</hi> Now what punishments God hath laid upon Perjuries, these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples that follow shall make known unto us. <hi>Osee</hi> the last King of Israel, being made (by Gods just judgement for his sinnes) subject and tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Salmanazar</hi> King of Ashur, without regard to the bond wherewith <note place="margin">2 Kings 17.</note> he was bound, and to his faith which he had plighted, conspired and ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red league with the King of Aegypt, against him: but he discovering their seditious and privie conspiracies, assembled his forces, spoyled his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and bad them warre on all sides; laying fiege to the chiefe Citie of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59545:57"/>
his Kingdome, after three yeeres tooke it, together with the forsworne King, whom he put in close prison, and kept very straightly, leading him and his whole Nation captive into Syria, to end their dayes in misery: of which evill, as of all others that happened in that warre, the disloyalty and Treason of <hi>Osee</hi> was the next and chiefest cause.</p>
               <p>Among the bed-roll of sinnes which <hi>Zedechias</hi> the last King of Iuda is noted withall in holy Scripture, Perjury is one of the count: for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he received his Kingdome of <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> and had sworne <note place="margin">2 Chron. 36.</note> fealty to him, as to his Soveraigne, yet brake he his oath in rebelling against him; which was the very cause of his destruction: for <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> to be revenged on his disloyalty, sent a puissant Armie against Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, which took, spoyled, and burnt it, and overtooke the Perjurer in his flight, and first made him a beholder of the slaughter of his owne children, and then had his owne eyes bored out, and was carried in chaines to Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, serving for a spectacle to all posteritie, of Gods wondrous judgements upon Perjurers. And thus both the Kingdomes of Israel and Iuda were for breach and falsifying their Oath quite extinguished and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out.</p>
               <p>The great deceiver and most treacherous person, one of them, that ever <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> Greece saw, was <hi>Lisander</hi> the Lacedemonian, a busie-body, full of cunning, subtilty, and craft, and one that performed the most of his acts of Warre, more by fraud and stratagems, than by any other meanes: this was he that said, That when the Lions skinne (meaning Fortitude) would not serve, it was needfull then to sow unto it the Foxes case (meaning subtilty) he made so little reckoning of forswearing himselfe, that he would often say, That children were to be cousened with trifles, as Dice and Cockles, and old men with Oathes: but with deceitfull tricks he was occasion of much evill, and divers murders: but at last this Foxe making warre against the Thebans, for that they had taken part with the Athenians against him, and given them succour and meanes for recovering their liberty, was taken in the trap, and slaine at the foot of their walls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Metius Suffetius,</hi> Generall of the Albanes, procured the Fidenates to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Livie.</note> warre against the Romanes, contrary to his oath which he had sworne unto them, and being called by the Romanes to their succour, and placed in an out Wing to helpe if need were, whilest the rest were fighting, hee drove away the time in ordering his men, and ranging them into squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, to see which part should have the best, that he might joyne himselfe unto that side. But <hi>Tullus</hi> the Roman King having obtained the victory, and seeing the cowardise, subtilty, and treason of this Albane, adjudged him to a most strange and vile death, answerable to his fact: for as he had in his body a double heart swimming between two streames, and now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to goe this way, now that, so was his body dismembred and torne in pieces by foure horses, drawing foure contrary wayes: to serve for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to all others to be more fearefull and true observers of their oathes than he was.</p>
               <p>In old time the Africans and Carthagenians were generally noted for perfidy and falshood above other Nations; the cause of which bruit was principally that old subtile Souldier <hi>Annibal,</hi> an old deceiver, and a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Perjurer, who by his crafts and cousenings which he wrought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Liv. Decad.</hi> 3. <hi>lib.</hi> 1.</note> Religion or feare of God, raised up the evill report. This subtile Foxe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59545:58"/>
having made warre in Italy sixteen yeeres, and all that while troubled and vexed the Romanes sore, after many victories, wastings of Countries, ruines, and sackings of Cities, and cruell bloodshed, was at length over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by <hi>Scipio</hi> in his owne Conntrey; and perceiving that his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men imputed the cause of their fall unto him, and sought to make him odious to the Romanes, by laying to his charge the breach of that league which was betwixt them, he fled to <hi>Antiochus</hi> King of Syria, not so much for his owne safeties fake, as to continue his warre against the Romanes, which he knew <hi>Antiochus</hi> to be in hammering, because they came so neere unto his Frontiers: but he found his hope frustrate; for King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> for the small trust he affied in him, and the daily suspition of his treachery, would not commit any charge of his Armie into his hand, although for valiantnesse and prowesse he was second to none of that Age. It came to passe therefore, that as soone as <hi>Antiochus</hi> was overthrown of the Romanes, he was constrained to flie to <hi>Prusius</hi> King of Bythinia, that tooke him into his protection: but being as treacherous himselfe, hee soone devised a meanes to betray him to <hi>Quintius,</hi> the Generall of the Romane Armie: which when <hi>Annibal</hi> understood, and seeing that all passages for evasion were closed up, and that he could not any way escape, he poysoned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and so miserably ended his treacherous life. And thus the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit which he practised towards others, fell at length upon his owne Pate, to his utter destruction.</p>
               <p>Albeit that Perjurers and forswearers were to the Egyptians very odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">Iustine.</note> and abominable (as wee said before) yet among them there was one <hi>Ptolome,</hi> who to bereave his sister <hi>Arsinoe</hi> of her Kingdome, stained himselfe with this villanous spot, and thereby brought his purpose to passe; for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending and protesting great affection and love unto her in the way of marriage (for such incestuous marriages were there through a perverse and damnable custome not unlawfull) and avowing the same by solemne oath before her Embassadours, did notwitstanding soon make knowne the drift of his intent, which was to make himselfe King: for being arrived in shew to consummate Marriage, at his first approach hee caused his Nephewes (her sonnes which she had by her former husband <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> and were come forth from their mother to give him entertainment on the way) to be slaine; yea, and lest they should escape his hands, hee pursued them even to their mothers bosome, and there murthered them, and after (expelling her also from her Kingdome) caught the Crowne, and reigned Tyrant in her roome: all which mischiefe he committed by reason of the faithlesse oath which hee had taken: and although that in such a case no oath ought to bee of force to confirme so lawfull affiance (though it bee pronounced and taken by the name and in the Temple of their Idols) yet notwithanding it being done with an evill conscience, and to an evill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he that did it can be no lesse then a Perjurer. But for this and other vices it came to passe, that ere long he was conquered by the Gaules, who taking him in battell, slew him and cut off his head, and having fastened it upon a Lance, carried it in signe of victory and triumph up and downe the hoast.</p>
               <p>A most notable example of the punishment of Perjurie and falshood in <hi>Vladislaus</hi> King of Hungary and his Army destroyed by the Turkes, is set downe in <hi>Bonfinus</hi> his Hungarian History, after this manner. It fell out <note place="margin">Bonfinus.</note>

that the King of Hungary had so well bestirred himselfe against the Turks, that <hi>Amurathes</hi> was glad (upon unequall conditions, and even to his owne hurt, and their good) to conclude a peace with him: wherein it was agreed, that certaine Provinces should be restored to the Hungarian, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise could not have been recovered but by great losse of men. This league being made, and the Articles thereof engrossed in both Languages, with a solemne oath taken on both parties for the consirmation of the same; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Cardinall of Florence, Admirall of the Navie which lay upon the Sea Hellespont (now called Saint <hi>Georges</hi> Arme, which divideth Turkie <note place="margin">It is so called by the French men, but more commonly, the Straits of Castile.</note> from Greece) sendeth Letters to the King of Hungary to perswade him to disannull and repeale this new concluded peace: This practise like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise did Cardinall <hi>Iulian,</hi> the Popes Legate in Hungarie, with might and maine helpe forward: which two good pillars of the Church, inspired with on and the same spirit, wrought together so effectually with the king, that at that instance he falsified his oath, broke the peace, and sent to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople to denounce Warre afresh; and forthwith whilst their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors were retyring their Garrisons out of Misia, to bring them into their hands againe, and had sent forty thousand crownes for the ransome of great men which were prisoners, and had restored the Realme of Rascia and all their Captives, according to the tenour of their late league, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this new breach: in the meane while (I say) he set forward his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie towards the great Turkes in all expedition. Now the Turkes secure and misdoubting nothing, were set upon unawares by the King, yet putting themselves in defence, there grew a long and sharpe battell, till <hi>Amurathes</hi> perceiving his side to decline, and almost overcome, pulled out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some the Articles of the aforesaid peace, &amp; lifting up his eyes to heaven, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered these speeches: O Iesus Christ, these are the leagues that thy Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have made and confirmed by swearing by thy name, and yet have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them againe: if thou beest a God, as they say thou art, revenge this injurie which is offered both thee and mee, and punish those Truce-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Varlets.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt let us adde a few more examples of fresher memory, as touching this ungodly Perjury: And first King <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedony, who never made reckoning of keeping his oathes, but swore and unswore them at his pleasure, and for his commodity: doubtlesse it was one of the chiefest cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses why he and his whole Progeny came quickly to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (as testifieth <hi>Pausanias)</hi> for hee himselfe being 46 yeeres old, was <note place="margin">In Areadicis.</note> slaine by one of his owne servants; after which <hi>Olympias</hi> his wife made away two of his sonnes, <hi>Anideus,</hi> and another which he had by <hi>Cleopatra, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus</hi> his neece, whom she sod to death in a Cauldron: his daughter <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonicaes</hi> children likewise all perished: and lastly, <hi>Alexander</hi> after all his great victories, in the middest of his pompe, was poysoned at Babylon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregorie Tours</hi> maketh mention of a wicked Varlet in France among the people called <hi>Averni,</hi> that forswearing himselfe in an unjust cause, had his <note place="margin">De confessori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</note> tongue so presently tyed, that he could not speake but roare, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, till by his earnest prayers and repentance the Lord restored to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the use of that unruly member.</p>
               <p>There were in old time certaine people of Italy called <hi>Aequi,</hi> whereof the memory remaineth onely at this day, for they were utterly destroyed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Liv. lib.</hi> 3:</note> by <hi>Q. Cincinnatus.</hi> These having solemnely made a league with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, and sworne unto it with one consent, afterward chose <hi>Gracchus Clui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> for their Captaine, and under his conduct spoyled the Fields and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of the Romanes, contrary to the former league and oath. Wherupon the Romans sent <hi>Q. Fabius, P. Volumnius,</hi> and <hi>A. Posthumius</hi> Embassadors to them, to complaine of their wrongs and demand satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: but their Captaine so little esteemed them, that he bad them deliver their message to an Oake standing thereby, whilest hee atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded other businesse. Then one of the three turning himselfe towards the Oake, spake on this manner: <hi>Thou hallowed oake, and whatsoever else belongeth to the gods in this place, heare and beare witnes of this disloyall part, and favor our iust complaints, that with the assistance of the gods wee may bee revenged on this injury.</hi> This done they returned home, and shortly after gathering a power of men, set upon and over came that truce-breaking Nation.</p>
               <p>In the yeer of Rome built, 317, the Fidenates revolted from the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and league of the Romans, to <hi>Toluminus</hi> the king of the Veyans, and adding cruelty to treason, killed foure of their embassadours that came to know the cause of their defection: which disloyalty the Romans not brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, undertooke war against them, and notwithstanding all their private and forrein strength, overthrew and slew them. In this battell it is said, that a Tribune of the souldiers seeing <hi>Toluminus</hi> bravely galloping up and down, and incouraging his souldiers, and the Romans trembling at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, said, Is this the breaker of leagues, and violater of the law of nations? If there be any holinesse on earth, my sword shall sacrifice him to the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59545:59"/>
soules of our slaine embassadours; and therewithall setting spurres to his horse, he unhorst him, and fastening him to the earth with his speare, cut off his perfidious head: whereat his army dismaied, retired, and became a slaughter to the enemies.</p>

This <hi>Atto</hi> under shew of friendship repaired to the castle, and gave his faith unto the earle, that if he would come downe to parle with the Emperor, he should safely return into his hold: the Earle mistrusting no fraud, went out of the castle gates with the Bishop towards the Emperour; but <hi>Atto</hi> (as it were suddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring himselfe, when indeed it was his devised plot) desireth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne back and dine ere he went, because it was somewhat late: so they do, dine, and returne. Now the Earle was no sooner come to the Emperor, but he caused to be presently put to death, notwithstanding he urged the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops promise and oath for his returne: for it was answered, that his oath was quit by returning backe to dine, as he had promised. And thus the Earle was wickedly betrayed, though justly punished. As for <hi>Atto</hi> the subtill traitor, indeed he possessod himselfe by this meanes of the Earles lands; but withall, the justice of God seised upon him, for within a while after he was stricken with a thunderbolt, and as some say, carried into mount Aetna, with this noyse, <hi>Sicpeccatalues, atque ruendorues.</hi>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59545:60"/>
he in detestation of the Popes villanie, burst forth into these termes, (many Bishops standing by) <hi>Behold here the hand wherewith I swore fealtie to the Emperor, this will be an argument of my breach of faith before God, and of your traiterous impulsion thereunto.</hi> And thus he deceased, justly punished even by his owne confession for his perjurie. Howbeit for all this manifest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the Pope and Bishops continued to persecute the poore Emperor, yea and to stir up his owne sonnes, <hi>Conrade</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> to fight against him; so hardned are their hearts against all Gods judgments.</p>

But his forsworne accusers by their death wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed his innocencie, which by their words they impugned: for the first, his house being set on fire extraordinarily, perished in flame, with all his family and progenie. The second languished away with an irkesome dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease that bespread his bodie all over. The third seeing the wofull ends of his companions, confessed all their villanie, and lamenting his case and crime, persisted so long weeping, till both his eyes were out.

               <p>The small successe that the Emperor <hi>Sigismund</hi> had in all his affaires, (after the violation of his faith given to <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> of Prague <note place="margin">Theatr. histor.</note> at the Councell of Constance, whom though with direct protestations
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59545:60"/>
and oathes he promised safe conduct and returne, yet he adjudged to be burned) doth testifie the odiousnesse of his sin in the sight of God. But above all, this one example is most worthie the marking, of a fellow that hearing perjury condemned in a pulpit by a learned preacher, and how it never escaped unpunished; said in a braverie, <hi>I have oft forsworne my selfe, and yet my right hand is not a whit shorter than my left.</hi> Which words he had scarce uttered, when such an inflamation arose in that hand, that he was constrained to go to the Chirurgion and cut it off, lest it should infect his whole bodie; and so his right hand became shorter than his left, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his perjurie, which he lightly esteemed of.</p>
               <p>About the yeare of our Lord 925, when King <hi>Ethelstane,</hi> otherwise cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Adelstane,</hi> raigned here in England, there was one <hi>Elfrede</hi> a Nobleman, who with a faction of seditious persons conspired against the King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after the death of his Father, and at Winchester went about to put out his eyes: but the King by the good providence of God escaped that danger; and <hi>Elfrede</hi> being accused thereof, fled to Rome, to the end to purge himself of the crime by oath before the Pope: who beeing brought to the Church of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and there swearing, or rather forswearing, himself to be cleere, when indeed he was guilty, behold the Lords hand on him, suddenly as soon as his oath was pronounced, he fell down in a strange sicknesse; and from thence being brought to the English house in Rome, within three daies after departed this life. The Pope sent word hereof to King <hi>Ethelstane,</hi> with demand, Whither he would have him buried among Christians or no: Who through the perswasions of his friends and kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, granted, that though he neither lived nor died like a Christian, yet he should have Christian buriall.</p>
               <p>In the towne of Rutlinquen a certaine passenger came into an Inne, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh. le Gall.</hi> 1 <hi>vol.</hi> of his Table-talk.</note> gave a budget to his hoast to be kept, in the which there was a great sum of money: but when he demanded it againe at his departure, the host de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it, and gave him injurious words, with many mocks and taunts. Whereupon the passenger calleth him in question before the Iudge, and because he wanted witnesses, desireth to have him sworne: who without all scruple offered to sweare and protest, That he never received or concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led any such budget of money from him; giving himselfe to the Devill if he swore falsely. The passenger seeing his forwardnesse to damne himself, demanded respit to consider of the matter, and going out, hee meets with two men, who enquire the cause of his comming thither, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by him, offer their help unto him in his cause: thereupon they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne before the Iudge, and these two unknowne persons justifie that the budget was delivered unto the host, and that hee had hidden it in such a place: whereat the host being astonished, by his countenance and gesture discovered his guiltinesse: the Iudge thereupon resolved to send him to prison, but the two unknowne witnesses (who were indeed two fiends of hell) began to say, you shall not need, for we are sent to punish his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and so saying, they hoisted him up into the ayre, where he vanished with them, and was never after found.</p>
               <p>In the yeare of our Lord 1055, <hi>Goodwine</hi> Earle of Kent sitting at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Stow.</hi> Chron.</note> with King <hi>Edward</hi> of England, it happened that one of the cupbearers stumbled, and yet fell not: whereat <hi>Goodwine</hi> laughing, said, That if one brother had not holpen another (meaning his legs) all the wine had been
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59545:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
spilt: with which words the King calling to mind his brothers death, which was slaine by <hi>Goodwine;</hi> answered, So should my brother <hi>Alphred</hi> have hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen me had not <hi>Goodwine</hi> been: then <hi>Goodwine</hi> fearing the Kings new kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led displeasure, excused himselfe with many words, and at last eating a morsell of bread, wished it might choke him if he were not guiltlesse of <hi>Alphreds</hi> bloud. But he swore falsly, as the judgement of God declared, for he was forthwith choaked in the presence of the King, ere he removed one foot from that place; though there be some say he recovered life againe.</p>
               <p>Long time after this, in the raigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> there was in the city of London, one <hi>Anne Averies</hi> widow, who forswore her selfe for <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Stow</hi> Chron.</note> a little money that she should have paid for six pounds of tow at a shop in Woodstreet: for which cause being suddenly surprised with the justice of God, shee fell downe speechlesse forthwith, and cast up at her mouth in great abundance, and with horrible stinke, that matter which by natures course should have been voided downewards, and so died, to the terrour of all perjured and forsworne wretches. There are in histories many more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to be found of this hurtfull and pernitious sin, exercised by one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards another, and one man towards another, in most prophane and villanous sort, neither shaming to be accounted forsworne, nor conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fearing to displease God and his majesty. But forasmuch as when we come to speak of murtherers in the next book, we shall have occasion to speake of them more, or of such like, I will referre the handling thereof unto that place: onely this, let every man learne by that which hath been spoken, to be sound and fraudlesse, and to keep his faith and promise to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men, if for no other cause, yet for feare of God, who leaveth not this sin unpunished, nor holdeth them guiltlesse that thus taketh his name in vaine.</p>

               </head>
               <p>AS touching Blasphemy, it was a most grievous and enormous sin, and contrary to this third Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, when a man is so wretched and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as to pronounce presumptuous speeches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, whereby his name is slandered and evill spoken of: which sinne cannot chuse but be sharply and severely punished; for if so be that God holdeth not him guiltles, that doth but take his name in vain must he not needs abhor him that blasphemeth his Name? See how me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriously that wicked and perverse wretch that blasphemed and murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (as it were) the name of God, among the people of Israel in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart, was punished: he was taken, put in prison, and condemned, and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily stoned to death by the whole multitude: and upon that occasion (as evill manners evermore begat good lawes) the Lord instituted a perpetuall <note place="margin">Levit. 24.</note> law and decree, that every one that should blaspheme and curse God, of what estate or degree soever, should be stoned to death, in token of dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59545:61"/>
which sentence, if it might now adaies stand in force, there would not raign so many miserable blasphemers and deniers of God as the world is now filled and infected with. It was also ordained by a new law of <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi>

                     <hi>Cod. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>tit.</hi> 43.</note> That blasphemies should be severely punished by the judges and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates of Commonweales: but such is the corruption and misery of this age, that those men that ought to correct others for such speeches, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes worst themselves: and there are that thinke, that they cannot be sufficiently feared and awed of men, except by horrible bannings and swearings they despight and maugre God: nay it is further come to that passe, that in some places, to swearc and ban be the markes and ensignes of a Catholike, and they are best welcome that can blaspheme most. How much then is that good King Saint <hi>Lewis</hi> of France to be commended, who <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nich.

Now wee call blasphemy (according to the Scripture phrase) every word that derogateth either from the bounty, mercy, justice, eternity, and soveraigne power of God. Of this sort was that blasphemous speech of one of King <hi>Iorams</hi> Princes, who at the time of the great famine in Samaria, when it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged by the Syrians, hearing <hi>Elizeus</hi> the Prophet say, that the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row there should be plenty of victuals and good cheap, rejected this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God made by his Prophet, saying that it was impossible; as if God were either a lyar, or not able to performe what he would: for this cause this unbeleeving blasphemer received the same day a deserved punishment for <note place="margin">2 King. 7.</note> his blasphemy, for he was troden to death in the gate of the city under the feet of the multitude that went out into the Syrians campe, forsaken and left desolate by them, through a feare which the Lord sent among them.</p>

               <p>In the time of the Machabees, those men that were in the strong hold called Gazara, fighting against the Iewes, trusting to the strength of the <note place="margin">2 Mach. 10.</note> place wherein they were, uttered forth most infamous speeches against God: but ere long, their blasphemous mouths were encountred by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne punishment: for the first day of the siege, <hi>Machabeus</hi> put fire to the towne, and consumed the place (with the blasphemers in it) to ashes.</p>

               <p>Nay, this sinne is so odious in the sight of God, that he punisheth even them that give occasion thereof unto others, yea though they be his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest children, as it appeareth by the words of the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> unto King <hi>David: Because of this deed</hi> (saith he) <hi>of murthering</hi> Vriah, <hi>and defiling</hi>

Three souldiers (amongst the Tyrigetes, a people of Sarmatia) passing through a Wood, there arose a tempest of thunder and lightening, which though commonly it maketh the greatest Atheists to tremble, yet one of them to shew his contempt of God and his judgements, burst forth into blasphemy and despightings of God. But the Lord soone tamed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious tongue: for he caused the winde to blow up by the root a huge tree, that fell upon him and crushed him to pieces, the other escaping to testifie to the World of his destruction.</p>
               <p>At a village called Benavides in Spain, two young men being together <note place="margin">Anthonio de Torquemeda.</note> in a field, there arose of a sudden a terrible tempest, with such violence of weather and winde, and withall so impetuous a whirlwinde, that it amased those that beheld it. The two young men seeing the fury thereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming amaine towards them, to avoid the danger ran away as fast as they possibly might: but make what haste they could it overtooke them: who fearing lest the same should swing them up into the ayre, fell flatlong down upon the earth, where the whirlwinde whisking about them a pretty while, and then passing forth, the one of them arose so altered and in such an agony, that he was scarcely able to stand on his feet: the other lying still and not stirring, some others afarre off, that stood under a hedge, went to see how hee did, and found him, to be starke dead, not without markes upon him of wonderfull admiration: for all his bones were so cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, that the pipes and joynts of his legges and armes were as easie to be turned the one way as the other, as though his whole body had been made of mosse; and besides, his tongue was pulled out by the roots, which could not by any meanes be found, though they sought for it most diligently. And this was the miserable end of this wretched man, who was noted to be a great outragious swearer &amp; blasphemer of Gods holy name; the Lord therfore chose him out, to make him an example to the world of his justice.</p>
               <p>No lesse notable is the example of a young girle, named <hi>Denis Benesield,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of the Church.</note> of twelve yeares of age: who going to schoole amongst other girles, when they fell to reason among themselves after their childish discretion about God, one among the rest said that he was a good old father: What, hee? (said the foresaid <hi>Denis)</hi> he is an old doting foole: which being told to her mistresse, she purposed to correct her the next day for it: but it chanced that the next day her mother sent her to London to the market, the wench greatly intreating her mother that she might not goe, so that she escaped her mistresses correction. But the Lord in vengeance met with her: for as she returned homeward, suddenly she was stricken dead, all the one side of her being black; and buried at Hackney the same night. A terrible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample (no doubt) both to old and young, what it is for children to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the Lord and God, and what it is for parents to suffer their young ones to grow up in blindnesse, without nurtering them in the feare of God, and reverence of his Majesty, and therefore worthy to be remembred of <note place="margin">

               <p>A certain souldier travelling through Marchia, a country of Almaigne, <note place="margin">

hee would giue himselfe bodie and soule unto him, he would promise to deliuer him out of their hands: the prisoner answering, said, That he had rather die being innocent, and without cause, than to be delivered by that meanes: againe the divell replied, and propounded unto him the great danger wherein he was, yea and used all cunning meanes possible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him: but seeing that he lost his labour, he at length left his suit, and promised him both helpe, and revenge upon his enemies, and that for nothing: advising him moreover when he came to judgement, to plead not guiltie, and to declare his innocencie and their wrong, and to intreat the Iudge to grant him one in a blew cap that stood by to be his advocate: (now this one in a blew cap was the Divell himselfe) the souldier accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his offer, being called to the barre, and indicted there of Felonie, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently desired to have his Atturney, who was there present to plead his cause: then began the fine and craftie Doctor of the lawes to plead, and defend his client verie cunningly, affirming him to be falsly accused, and consequently unjustly condemned, and that his host did withhold his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and had offered him violence, and to prove his assertion he reckoned up every circumstance in the action, yea the verie place were they had hidden the mony. The host on the other side stood in deniall very impudently, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing the divell might take him if he had it: then the subtill lawyer in the blew cap, looking for no other vantage, left pleading, and fell to lay hold of the host, and carrying him out of the Sessions house, hoisted him into the ayre so high, that he was never after seen nor heard of. And thus was the souldier delivered from the execution of the law most strangely, to the astonishment of all the beholders, that were eye witnesses of that which happened to the for sworne and cursing host.</p>
               <p>In the yere of our Lord 1551, at Megalopole neer Voildstat, it happened <note place="margin">Iohn Wierus.</note> in the time of the celebration of the feast of Pentecost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the people being set on drikingng and carousing, that a woman in the company commonly named the Devill in her oathes; till that he being so often called on, came of a sudden, and carried her through the gate aloft into the ayre before them all, who ran out astonished to see whither he would transport her, and found her a while hanging in the ayre without the towne, and then fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe upon the ground dead.</p>
               <p>About the same time there lived in a City of Savoy one that was both a monstrous swearer, &amp; also otherwise very vicious, who put many good men to much fruitlesse paines, that in regard of their charge employed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves often to admonish and reprove his wicked behaviour, to the end he might amend it: but all in vaine, they might as well cast stones against the wind; for he would not so much as listen to their words, much lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his manners. Now it fell out that the Pestilence being in the City, he was infected with it, and therefore withdrew himselfe a part with his wife &amp; another kinswoman into a garden which he had: neither yet in this extremity did the Ministers forsake him, but ceased not continually to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort him to repentance, and to lay before his eyes his faults and offences to the end to bring him into the right way. But he was so farre from being touched or moved with these godly admonitions, that he strove rather to harden himselfe more and more in his sinnes. Therefore one day hasting forward his owne mishap, as hee was swearing and denying God, and giving himselfe to the Devill, and calling for him with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59545:64"/>
behold even the Devill indeed snatched him up suddenly, and heaved him into the aire, his wife and kinswoman looking on, and seeing him fly over their heads. Being thus swiftly transported, his cap tumbled from his head, and was found at Rosne; but himselfe no man could ever after set eye on. The magistrate advertised hereof, came to the place where he was taken, to be better informed of the truth, taking the witnesse of the two women touching that which they had seene. Here may wee see the strange and terrible events of Gods just vengeance upon such vile caitifes; which doubtlesse are made manifest to strike a feare and terrour into the heart of every swearer and denier of God (the world being but too full at this day of such wretches) that are so inspired with Satan, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not speake but they must name him, even him that is both an enemy to God and man, and like a roaring lion runneth and roveth too and fro to devoure them: not seeking any thing but mans destruction. And yet when any paine assaileth them, or any trouble disquieteth their minds, or any danger threateneth to oppresse their bodies, desperately they call upon him for aid, when indeed it were more needfull to commend themselves to God, and to pray for his grace and assistance, having both a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement so to doe, and a promise adjoyned, that he will help us in our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, if we come unto him by true and hearty prayer. It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without just cause, that God hath propounded and laid open in this corrupt age, a Theatre of his Iudgements, that every man might be warned thereby.</p>

the tenor whereof is this, I knew (said he) in France a man of good parts, well instructed in Religion, and a master of a Familie, who in his anger cursing, and bidding the Divell take one of his children, had presently his wish; for the childe was possessed immediatly with a Spirit: from which though by the servent and continuall prayers of the Church he was at length released, yet ere he had fully recovered his health he died.

                  </note> a city in the Bishopricke of Bamburg, there was a certaine crooked Priest both in body and minde, through age and evill conditions, that could not go but upon crutches, yet would needs be lifted into the pulpit to make a Sermon: his text was out of the 11 chap. of the first Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the Corinthians, touching the Lords Supper; whereout taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to defend the Papisticall errours and the Masse, hee used these or such like blasphemous speeches, O <hi>Paul, Paul,</hi> if thy doctrine touching the receiving of the Sacrament in both kinds be true, and if it be a wicked thing to receive it otherwise, then would the divell might take me: and (turning to the people) if the Popes doctrine concerning this point be not true, then am I the divels bondslaue, neither do I feare to pawne my soule upon it. These and many other blasphemous words he used, till the Divell came indeed, transformed into the shape of a tall man, blacke and terrible, sending before him such a fearefull noyse, and such a wind, that the people supposed that the Church would have fallen on their heads: but he not able to hurt the rest, tooke away the old Priest, being his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bondslave, and carried him so far that he was never heard of. The bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rugenstines brother hardly escaped his hands: for he came back to fetch him; but he defending himself with his sword, wounded his owne body, and very narrowly escaped with his life. Beside, after this there were many visions seene about the citie, as armies of men ready to enter and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise them, so that well was he that could hide himselfe in a corner. At another time after, the like noyse was heard in the Church whilst they were baptising an infant; and all this for the abhominable cursing and blasphemy of the prophane Priest.</p>

and vow which he had made the day before, and if it were not lawfull for him to breake his necke; and withall stroke the poore man, trembling with feare, over the shoulders, that his feet and his hands presently dried up, so that he lay there not able to stir, till by help of men he was carried home; the Lord not giving the Devill so much power over him as he wished him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; but yet permitting him to plague him on this sort, for his amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and our example.</p>

Then loe, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill having got full possession of her, came in person, and transported her into the aire before them all, with most horrible outcries and roarings, and in that sort carried her round about the towne, that the Inhabitants were ready to die with feare, and by ct by tore her in foure pieces, leaving in four severall high wayes a quarter, that all that came by might be witnesses of her punishment. And then returning to the marriage, threw her bowels upon the table before the Major of the towne, with these words, <hi>Behold, these dishes of meat belong to thee, whom the like destruction awaiteth, if thou doest not amend thy wicked life.</hi> The reporters of this history were, <hi>Iohn Herman</hi> the Minister of the said towne, with the Major himselfe and the whole Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, being desirous to have it knowne to the world for example sake.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Luthers</hi> conferences there is mention made of this story following: <note place="margin">Luther:</note> Divers noblemen were striving together at a horse race, and in their course cried, The Devill take the last. Now the last was a horse that broke loose, whom the Devill hoisted up into the aire and tooke cleane away. Which teacheth us, not to call for the Devill, for he is ready alwayes about us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called and unlooked for, yea many legions of them compasse us about even in our best actions to disturbe and pervert us.</p>
               <p>A certaine man not far from Gorlitz provided a sumptuous supper, and <note place="margin">Iob. Fincelius.</note> invited many guests unto it, who at the time appointed refused to come: he in anger cried, Then let all the Devils in hell come. Neither was his wish frivolous; for a number of those hellish fiends came forthwith, whom he not discerning from men, came to welcome and entertaine: but as he
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59545:65"/>
tooke them by the hands, and perceiued in stead of fingers, clawes, all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied he ran out of the doores with his wife, and left none in the house but a young infant, with a foole sitting by the fire, whom the Divels had no power to hurt, neither any man else, save the goodly supper, which they made away withall, and so departed.</p>
               <p>It is notoriously knowne in Oundle a towne in Northamptonshire, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all that were acquainted with the partie, namely one <hi>Hacket,</hi> of whom more hath spoken before, how he used in his earnest talke to curse himselfe on this manner; <hi>If it be not true, then let a visible confusion come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me.</hi> Now he wanted not his wish, for he came to a visible confusion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as hath been declared more at large in the twentieth chapter of this booke. At Witeberg, before <hi>Martin Luther</hi> and divers other learned men, a woman whose daughter was possessed with a spirit, confessed, That by her curse that plague was fallen upon her: for being angry at a time, she bad the Divell take her, and she had no sooner spoken the word, but he tooke her indeed, and possessed her in most strange sort.</p>
               <p>No whit lesse strange and horrible is that which happened at Neoburg <note place="margin">Theatr. histor</note> in Germanie, to a sonne that was cursed of his mother in her anger, with this curse, she prayed God she might never see him returne aliue; for the same day the yong man bathing himselfe in the water, was drowned, and never returned to his mother alive, according to her ungodly wish.</p>
               <p>The like judgement of God we read of to have beene executed upon <note place="margin">Antonio de Torquemeda.</note> another sonne that was banned and cursed by his mother, in the citie of Astorga. The mother in her rage cursed one of her sons with detestable maledictions, betaking him to the Diuels of hell, and wishing that they would fetch him out of her presence, with many other horrible execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: This was about ten a clocke at night, the same being very darke and obscure; the boy at last through feare went out into a little court behind the house, from the which hee was suddenly hoised up into the ayte, by men in shew of grim countenance, great stature, and loathsome and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible gesture, but indeed cruell fiends of hell, and that with such swiftnesse (as he himselfe after confessed) that it was not possible, to his seeming, for any bird in the world to fly so fast: and lighting downe amongst cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine mountaines of bushes and briers, was trailed through the thickest of them, and so all torne and rent, not only in his cloaths, but also in his hands and face and almost his whole body. At last the boy remembring God, and beseeching him of helpe and assistance, the cruell fiends brought him backe againe through the aire, and put him in at a little window into a chamber in his fathers house, where after much search and griefe for him, hee was found in this pittifull plight, and almost besides himselfe. And thus though they had not power to deprive him of his life, as they had done the former, yet the Lord suffered them to afflict the parents in the sonne, for the good of both parents and sonne if they belonged unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>But above all, this is most strange which hapned in a town of Misina, <note place="margin">

the Faithfull his paines were somewhat mitigated, though not remitted: three yeares he continued standing, with a post at his backe for his ease, and foure yeares sitting, at the end whereof he died; nothing weakened in his understanding, but professing the faith, and not doubting of his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Christ Iesus. When he was demanded at any time how he did: he answered most usually, That he was fastened of God, and that it was not in man but in Gods mercy for him to be released.</p>

                  <hi>Iohn Peter</hi> sonne in law to <hi>Alexander</hi> that cruel Keeper of Newgate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a most horrible swearer and blasphemer, used commonly to say, If it be not true, I pray God I may rot ere I die: and not in vaine, for he rotted away indeed, and so dyed in misery.</p>
               <p>Hither we may adde a notable example of a certaine yong gallant that was a monstrous swearer, who riding in the company of divers gentlemen, <note place="margin">Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents. pag. 2105.</note> began to sweare and most horribly blaspheme the name of God: unto whom one in the company with gentle words said, he should one day an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for that: the Yonker taking snuffe thereat, Why (said he) takest thou thought for me? Take thought for thy winding sheet. Well (quoth the other) amend, for death giveth no warning, as soone commeth a lambes skin to the market, as an old sheeps. Gods wounds (said he) care not thou for me: raging still on this manner worse and worse, till at length passing on their journey, they came riding over a great bridge, upon which this gentleman swearer spurred his horse in such sort, that he sprang cleane o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with the man on his backe, who as hee was going, cried, Horse and man and all to the Divell. This terrible story Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi> preached and uttered at <hi>Pauls</hi> crosse: and one <hi>Haines</hi> a Minister of Cornwall (the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hender of this man) was the reporter of it to Master <hi>Fox,</hi> out of whom I have drawne it.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow it is another kind of taking the Name of God in vaine, to despise his Word and Sacraments: for like as among earthly princes, it is accounted a crime no lesse than treason, either to abuse their pictures, to counterfeit or deprave their seales, to rent, pollute, or corrupt their letters patents, or to use unreverently their messengers, or any thing that commeth from them: So with the Prince of heaven it is a fin of high degree, either to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse his Word prophanely, which is the letters patents of our salvation; or handle the Sacraments unreverently, which are the seales of his mercy; or to despise his Ministers, which are his messengers untous. And this he maketh knowne unto us not only by Edicts and Commandments, but
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59545:66"/>
also by examples of his vengeance on the heads of the offendors in this case. For the former, look what <hi>Paul</hi> saith, That for the unworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Sacraments, many were weake and sicke among the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 29, 30.</note> and many slept. How much more then for the abusing and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sacraments? And the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> That for casting the Word <note place="margin">Psal. 50. 16, 17.</note> of God behinde them, they should have nothing to do with his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. How much more then for prophaning and deriding his Word? And <hi>Moses,</hi> when the people murmured against him and <hi>Aaron,</hi> saith, That <note place="margin">Exod. 16. 8.</note> their murmurings were not against them, which were but Ministers, but against the Lord. How much more then is the Lord enraged, when they are scoffed at, derided, and set at naught? Hence it is that the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 2. &amp; 12. 13. Apoc. 22. 18. Proverb 30. 6;</note> a Wo to him that addeth or taketh away from the Word; and calleth them dogs that abuse such precious pearles.</p>
               <p>But let us come to the examples wherein the grievousnesse of this sinne willly more open than by any words can be expressed.</p>
               <p>First, to begin with the house of Israel, which were the sole select peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord, whom he had chosen out of all other nations of the world, to be his owne peculiar flocke, and his chiefe treasure, above all other people of the earth, and a kingdome of Priests, and a holy Nation; when <note place="margin">Exod. 19 6.</note> as they contemned and despised his Word spoken unto them by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and cast his law behinde their backe, he gave them over into the hands of their enemies, and of <hi>Ammi</hi> made them <hi>Loammi;</hi> that is, of his people, made them not his people: and of <hi>Ruhama, Loruhama;</hi> that is, of such as had found mercy and favour at Gods hand, a nation that should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no mercy nor favour, as the Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> speaketh. <note place="margin">Hosea 1. 6, 7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This we see plainly verified first in the ten tribes, which under <hi>Ieroboam</hi> fell away from the Scepter of Iuda: for after that the Lord had sundry times scourged them by many particular punishments, as the famin, sword, and pestilence, for their idolatry and rebellion to his law; at the last in the ninth yere of the raign of <hi>Hoshea</hi> King of Israel, he brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them a finall and generall destruction, and delivered them into the hands of the King of Ashur, who carried them away captive into Assyria; and placed them in Hala and in Habor, by the river of Gosan, and in the cities of the Medes; and in stead of them seated the men of Babel, of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thah, Ava, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, in the cities of Samaria. Thus were they utterly rooted up, and spued out of the land of their inheritance, and their portion given unto strangers, as was threatned to them by the mouth of <hi>Moses</hi> the servant of the Lord: and the cause of all this is set down by the <note place="margin">Deu. 28. a King. 17. 13.</note> holy Ghost, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 17. 13. to be, for that though the Lord had testified to them by al his prophets &amp; seers, saying, <hi>Turn from your evill wayes, and keepe my commandements and my statutes, according to all the Law which I commanded your fathers:</hi> neverthelesse they would not obey, but hardned their necks: &amp; then it followeth in the 18 ver, <hi>Therfore the Lord was exceeding wroth with Israel, and put them out of his sight, and none was left but the Tribe of Iuda onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now though the kingdome of Iuda continued in good estate long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the desolation of the ten tribes, (for this hapned in the raigne of <hi>Ahaz.</hi> King of Iuda;) yet afterward in the raigne of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> the great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous citie Ierusalem was taken by <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> the King of Babel, and utterly ruined and defaced: the glorious and stately temple of the Lord, built by <hi>Salomon,</hi> the wonder of the world, was burnt down to ashes, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59545:67"/>
with all the houses of Ierusalem, and all other great houses in the land: all the rich vessels and furniture of the temple, of gold, silver, and brasse, were carried to Babel by <hi>Nabuzaradan</hi> the chiefe steward. The king himselfe was bound in chaines, and after he had seen his owne sons slaine before his eyes, had his owne eyes put out, that he might never more take comfort of the light. The priests and all the greatest and richest of the people were carried away in captivity, and only the poore were left behind to dresse the vines and til the land. Now what was the cause of this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable destruction of this holy City, of the Temple and Sanctuary of the Lord, and of his owne people? it is set downe by the holy-Ghost in expresse word, 2 Chro. 36. 15, 16. That, <hi>When the Lord sent unto them by his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron, 36. 15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Messengers, rising early, and sending, because he had compassion on them, and on his habitation, they mocked the Messengers of God, despised his words, and misused his Prophets: and therefore the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, and there was no remedy.</hi> Behold here the grievous judgement of the Lord upon such as contemned his Word, and despised his Prophets.</p>
               <p>Thus was the first city and temple destroyed: and did the second fare any better? no verily, but far worse: for as their sinne was greater, in that the former Iews contemned only the Word spoken by the Prophets which were but servants, these despised the Word spoken by the Sonne himself, which is the Lord of life; so their punishment was also the greater: for as the Apostle saith, <hi>If they which despised</hi> Moses <hi>Law died without mercy, how</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 28. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>much sorer punishment are they worthy of which tread under foot the Sonne of God, and count the bloud of the Testament as an unholy thing, and neglect so great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which first began to be preached by the Lord himselfe, and afterward was</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>confirmed by them which heard him.</hi> Therefore the destruction of the second city and temple by <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Vespasian</hi> Emperours of Rome, was far more lamentable than that of the former: yea, so terrible and fearefull was the judgement of God upon that nation at this time, that never the like cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and misery was heard or read of: there at the siege of Ierusalem the famin was so great within the walls, and the sword so terrible without, that within they were constrained to eat not only leather and old shoo's, but horse-dung, yea their owne excrements, and some to devour their owne children: and as many as issued out were crucified by the Romans, as they had crucified the Saviour of the world, till they had no more wood to naile them on. So that it was most true which our Saviour foreprophesied, That <hi>such should be the tribulation of that time, as was not from the beginning of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 24. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>the world, nor should be againe to the end.</hi> At this destruction perished eleven hundred thousand Iewes, as Historians report; besides them which <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> slew in subduing the country of Galilee: over and besides them also which were sould and sent into Aegypt and other provinces, to vile slavery, to the number of seventeene thousand: two thousand were brought with <hi>Titus</hi> in triumph; of which, part he gave to be devoured of wilde beasts, and part otherwise most cruelly were slaine. By whose case all nations may take example, what it is to reject the visitation of Gods verity being sent unto them, and much more to persecute them which be sent of God for their salvation. And here is diligently to be observed the great equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this judgment: they refused Christ to be their King, and chose rather to be subject unto <hi>Caesar;</hi> now they are by the said (their owne) <hi>Caesar</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, when as Christs subjects the same time escaped the danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:59545:67"/>
The like example of Gods wrathfull punishment is to be noted no lesse in the Romans also themselves, for despising Christ and his Gospel: for when <hi>Tiberius Nero</hi> the Emperor having received by letters from <hi>Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tertul. Apol. cap.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Pilat,</hi> a true report of the doings of Christ Iesus, of his miracles, resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and ascention into heaven, and how he was received as God of many good men, was himselfe mooved with beleefe of the same, and did confer thereof with the whole Senat of Rome, to have Christ adored as God. But they not agreeing thereunto, refused him, because that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the law of the Romans, he was consecrated (said they) for a God before the Senat of Rome had decreed and approved him. Thus the vaine Senat which were contented with the Emperor to raign over them, were not contented with the meeke King of glory, the Sonne of God, to be their King; yea they contemned also the preaching of the two blessed Apostles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> who were also most cruelly put to death in the later end of <hi>Domitius Nero</hi> his raigne, and the yeare of Christ 69, for the testimony and saith of Christ. And therefore after much like sort to the Iews were they scourged and entrapped by the same way which they did prefer: for as they preferred the Emperour, and rejected Christ, so did <note place="margin">Sueton. Tacitus.</note> God stirre up their owne Emperours against them, in such sort, that both the Senators themselves were all devoured, and the whole city most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly afflicted the space almost of three hundred yeares together. Neither were they only thus scourged by their Emperors, but also by civill wars, whereof three were sought in two yeares at Rome after <hi>Nero's</hi> death: as likewise by other casualties: for in <hi>Suetonius</hi> is testified, five thousand were hurt and slaine by fall of a Theatre.</p>
               <p>How heavy and searefull the judgement of God hath beene towards those seven famous Churches of Asia, to the which the holy Ghost wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his seven Epistles, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2 <hi>and</hi> 3. histories sufficiently testifie, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience sheweth: for whereas in the Apostles time, and long after in the dayes of persecution, no Churches in the world more flourished; after, when they began to make light account of the word of God, and to fall away from the truth to errors, from godlinesse to impieties, the Lord also made light account of them, and removed his Candlesticke, that is, the ministery of his Gospell, from amongst them, and made them a prey unto <note place="margin">Revel. 2. 5.</note> their enemies: and so they which before were subjects to Christ, are now slaves to <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and there where the true God was worshipped is now a filthy Idol adored; and instead of the Gospel of Christ, is the Turks Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran; in stead of the seven stars and seven candlesticks are seven thousand priests of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and worshippers of him: and thus for the contempt of the Gospel of Christ, is the Chrurch of Christians made a cage of Divels.</p>
               <p>Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> in his Ecclesticall history of England reporteth, That <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Beda li.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 15.</note> about the yeare of our Lord 420, after that the Brittons had been long afflicted by the Irish, Picts, and Scots, and that the Lord had given them rest from all their enemies, and had blessed them with such great plenty of corn, and fruits of the earth, as had not been before heard of, they fell into all manner of sins and vices, and in stead of shewing themselves thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Lord for his great mercies, provoked his indignation more fiercely against them: for, as he saith, together with plenty grew ryot, and this was accompanied with a train of many other foule enormities, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the hatred of the truth, &amp; contempt of the Word, and that not only in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59545:68"/>
the Laity and ignorant people, but even also in the Clergy and Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards of the people: for which cause the Lord first sent among them such a contagious plague, that the living were scarce sufficient to bury the dead: and when by this punishment they were not reclaimed, then by their owne counsels and procurement the Lord brought upon them a fierce and mighty nation, even the Saxons of Germany; who albeit they came at first as helpers and succorers of them against their enemies, yet ere long proved their sorest foes themselves, and after much bloudshed drave them almost quite out of their Kingdome, confining them into a haven, nooke, and corner of the same, where they remaine till this day: and all this came upon them (saith that reverend Authour) for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude for Gods mercies, and contempt of the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Againe, we reade a little before this, how that God stirred up <hi>Gildas</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, pag. 32.</note> a godly learned man, to preach to the old Brittons, and to exhort them to repentance and amendment of life, and to forewarne them of plagues to come, if they repented not: but what availed it? <hi>Gildas</hi> was laughed to scorne and taken for a false Prophet; the Brittons, with whorish faces and unrepentant hearts, went forward in their sins; and what followed? God to punish their contempt of his Word and Ministers, sent in their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies on every side, and destroying them, gave their land to other nations.</p>
               <p>Againe, not many yeares past, Almighty God seeing idolatry, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, <note place="margin">Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents. pag. 32.</note> hypocrisie, and wicked living used in this land, raised up that godly learned man <hi>Iohn Wickliffe</hi> to preach unto our fathers repentance, and to exhort them to forsake their idolatry and superstition: but his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations were not regarded, he with his sermons was despised, his bookes and himselfe after his death, were burnt: What ensued? A most grievous and heavy vengeance: they slew their lawfull King, and set up three other on a row, under whom all the noble bloud was slaine up, and halfe the Commons destroyed; what by warre in France, and civile dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord among themselves, the cities and towns were decayed, and the land brought half to a wildernesse. O, extrem plagues of Gods just vengeance!</p>
               <p>But these examples be generall over whole nations: now let us des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to particular judgments upon private persons, for contemning, scorning, or despising the Word of God, the holy Sacraments, and the Ministers of the same.</p>

In the Vniversity of Oxford the history of Christ was also played, and cruelly punished, and that not many yeares since: for he that bore the person of Christ, the Lord struck him with such a giddinesse of spirit and brain, that he became mad forthwith, crying when he was in his best humour, That God had laid this judgment upon him for playing Christ.

This is a terrible example for all those that be mockers, at the Word of God, to warne them (if they doe not repent) lest the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God fall upon them in like manner.

Paris. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 50.</note> complained, that (as many other things) so also the observation of the Sabbath was greatly decayed through the abuse of Christian liberty; in that men too much followed the delights of the world, and their owne worldly pleasures, both wicked and dangerous: They further adde, <hi>Multi nánque nostrum visu, multi etiam quorundam relatu dedicimus, &amp;c.</hi> For many of us have been eye-witnesses, many have intelligence of it by the relation of others that some men upon this day being about their husbandry, have been strucken with thunder, some have been maimed and made lame, some have had their bodies (even bones and all) burnt in a moment with visible fire, and have consumed to ashes, and many other judgements of God have been, and are daily; Whereby it is declared, that God is offended with
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59545:71"/>
the dishonour of so high a day. And our time hath not wanted examples in this kind, whosoever hath observed them, when sometimes in the faires upon this day the Wares have swumme in the streetes; sometimes the scaffolds at Playes have falne downe, to the hurting and endangering of many; sometime one thing, sometime another hath fallen out, to the great damage and hurt of many that have no conscience of this day; yea, often to the endangering of their lives: and that which is most strange, within these late yeares, a whole town hath been twice burnt for the breach of the Sabbath, by the inhabitants, as all men judged: The just report thereof I passe over here to set downe, untill such time as I shall be better instructed.</p>
               <p>Famous and memorable also is that example which happened at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in the yeare 1583 at Paris garden, where, upon the Sabbath day were gathered together (as accustomably they used) great multitudes of prophane people, to behold the sport of Beare baiting, without respect of the Lords day, or any exercise of religion required therein: which prophane impiety, the Lord that he might chasten in some sort, and shew his dislike thereof, he caused the scaffolds suddenly to breake, and the beholders to tumble headlong downe; so that to the number of eight persons, men and women, were slaine therewith, besides many others which were sore hurt and bruised, to the shortening of their dayes. The like example happened at a towne in Bedford shire called Risley, in the yeare 1607: Where the floore of a chamber, wherein a number were gathered together to see a play on the Sabbath day, fell downe, by meanes whereof many were sore hurt, and some killed. Surely, a friendly warning to such as more delight themselves with the cruelty of beasts, and vain sports, than with the works of mercy and Religion, the fruits of a true faith, which ought to be the Sabbath dayes exercise. And thus much for the examples of the first Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whereof if some seeme to exceed credit, by reason of the strangenesse of them, yet let us know, that nothing is impossible to God; and that hee doth often worke miracles to controll the obstinate impiety and rebellion of mortall men against his commandement. Besides, there is not one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample here mentioned, but it hath a credible or probable Author for the avoucher of it. Let us now, out of all this that hath been spoken, gather up this wholsome lesson, to love God with all our heart and affection, to the end we may worship him, invocate his holy name, and repose all the confidence of our salvation upon him alone through Christ Iesus, seeking by pleasing and obeying his will, to set forth his glory, and render him due thanks for all his benefits.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee have seene in the former Booke, what punishments they have incurred, that either malitiously or otherwise have transgressed and broken the commandements of the first Table: Now it followeth to discover the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements which God hath sent upon the transgressors of the second Table. And first concerning the first commandement therof, which is, <hi>Honour thy father and mother, that thy dayes may be prolonged in the land which the Lord thy God hath given thee. Cham</hi> one of old <hi>Noah's</hi> sonnes, was guilty of the breach of this <note place="margin">Gen 9.</note> Commandement; who in stead of performing that reverence to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which he ought (and that presently after the deluge, which being yet fresh in memory, might have taught him to walke in the feare of God) came so short of his duty, that when he saw his nakednesse, hee did not hide it, but mocked and jeasted at it: for which cause hee was cursed both of his father, and of God, in the person of his youngest sonne <hi>Chanaan,</hi> and made a servant to the servants of his brethren: which curse was fulfilled in <note place="margin">Num. 33. Deut. 7.</note> his posterity the Canaanites, who being forsaken of God, were rooted up and spued out of their land, because of their sinnes and abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Marvellous strange was the malice of <hi>Absolon,</hi> to rebell so furiously <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.</note> against his father <hi>David,</hi> as to wage warre against him: which he did with all his strongest endeavours, without sparing any thing that might further his proceedings; insomuch that he grew to that outrage and madnesse, through the wicked and pernitious counsell of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> that hee sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not villanously to commit incest with his fathers concubines, and <note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.</note> pollute his bloud even before the eyes of the multitude: by which means being become altogether odious and abhominable, hee shortly after lost <note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.</note> the battell: wherein though himselfe received no hurt nor wound, yet was he not therefore quit; but being pursued by Gods just judgement, fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly into the snare which he had deserved: for as he rode along the forrest, to save himselfe from his fathers army; his moyle carrying him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a thicke oake, left him hanging by the haire upon a bough betwixt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59545:72"/>
heaven and earth, untill being found by <hi>Ioab,</hi> he was wounded to death with many blowes. Whereby every man may plainly see that God wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no means to punish sinners when it pleaseth him; but maketh the dumbe and sencelesse creatures the instruments of his vengeance: for hee that had escaped the brunt and danger of the battell, (and yet not having therefore escaped the hand of God) was by a bruit beast brought under a sencelesse tree, which God had appointed to catch hold of him as an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of his just judgement: which if wee consider, is as strange and wonderfull an accident as may possible happen; and such an one as God himselfe provided, to punish this wicked, proud, and rebellious wretch withall: for seeing his outrage and villany was so great as to rebell against his father, and so good and kinde a father towards him as he was, it was most just, that he should endure so vile a punishment. Beside, herein doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse God would lay open to the eyes of all the world, a fearefull spectacle of his judgements against wicked and disobedient children, thereby to terrifie the most impudent and malitious wretches that live, from this horrible sinne. And for the same cause it was his pleasure, that that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and false <hi>Achitophel</hi> should fall into extreme ignominy and confusion for forsaking <hi>David,</hi> and setting forward with counsell and presence yong <hi>Absolon</hi> against his father; for which cause with despaire he hung him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Now by this example it is easie to perceive how unpleasant this sin is in Gods sight, and how much he would have every man to hate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test it, seeing that Nature her selfe teacheth and instructeth us so farre, as to yeeld duty and obedience unto those that begat, nourished, and brought us up.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding all this, yet is the world full of ill advised and ill nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured youth, that are little lesse disobedient unto their parents than <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> was, as <hi>Adramalech</hi> and <hi>Saraser,</hi> that slew their father <hi>Sennacherib</hi> as he was worshipping in the Temple of <hi>Nisroth</hi> his god: but whereas they loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">2 King. 19. 37.</note> for the soveraignty, they lost the benefit of subjection, and were banished into Armenia, their brother <hi>Esarhaddon</hi> raigning in their stead.</p>

                  <hi>Gregory</hi> of Tours maketh mention of one <hi>Crannius</hi> the son of <hi>Clotarius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Greg.</hi> of Tours fourth booke.</note> King of France, who having conspired treacherously, and raised warre against his father, together with the Earle of Brittaine his supporter, were both vanquished and put to flight; but the Earle was slaine in the pursuit: The Prince himselfe also (thinking to escape by sea, where lay provided certaine ships ready to receive him) was in the mid way overtaken, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his wife and children, whom he purposed to make partakers of his fortune, and were altogether (by the expresse commandement of his father) shut up in a little house, and there burned together. In this wise did <hi>Clotarius</hi> revenge the treachery and rebellion of his sonne, after a more severe, cruell, and fierce manner than King <hi>David</hi> did, who would have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his sonne <hi>Absolons</hi> life, notwithstanding all his wickednesse, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious and furious rebellion: but this man contrariwise being bereft of all fatherly affection, would use no compassion towards his sonne, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded so cruell an execution to bee performed, not onely upon him, but upon his daughter in law also, and their children, perchance altogether innocent and guiltlesse of that crime. A very rare and strange example, seeing it is commonly seene, that grandfathers use more to cherish and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59545:72"/>
cocker their childrens children than their own. Therefore we must think, that it was the providence of God to leave behind a notable example of his most just and righteous severity against disobedient and rebellious chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to the end to amase and feare all others from enterprising the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip Comineus</hi> hath recorded the treacherous tragedy of a most wicked <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Philip Comine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in the reigne of <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth. <hi>cap.</hi> 63</note> and cruell sonne called <hi>Adolphus</hi> (for the world waxeth every day worse than other) that came in an evening suddenly to take his father the Duke of Gilderland prisoner, even as he was going to bed, and would not give him so much liberty as to pull on his hose (for he was bare legged) but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him away in all haste, making him march on foot without breeches five long Almaine miles, in a most cold weather: and then clapt him up in the bottome of a deep tower, where there was no light save by a little window, and there kept him close prisoner six moneths together. After which cruell fact, he himselfe was taken prisoner in like manner, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried bound to Namur, where he lay a long time, untill the Gaunts reprived him forthwith, and led him with them against Tournay, where he was slain: in the while of his imprisonment, his father yeelding to nature, disinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited him of all his goods, for his vile ingratitude and unnaturall cruelty, and left the succession of his dukedome to the Duke of Bourgondy.</p>
               <p>In the yeare of our Lord 1461, in a village called Iuchi, neere to Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Enguerr. de Monstr. vol.</hi> 2.</note> there dwelt a certaine man (or rather a beast) that in a great rage threw his owne mother out of his doores thrice in one day, and the third time told her in fury, That hee had rather see his house on fire, and burnt to coles, than that she should abide there but one day longer. It happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that the very same day, according to his cursed speech, his house was indeed fired, but how or whence no man could judge: and the fire was so fierce, that it consumed to ashes not only that house, but also twelve other houses adjoyning: which was an evident figure of Gods just judgement in punishing so vile and unnaturall a deed by fire, seeing he deserved at the least to lose his house for banishing her out of it, that had borne him in her belly, and nourished him with the milke of her paps.</p>
               <p>In this place I may fitly insert two memorable examples of the same <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Alex. ab Alex. general. dier. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 14.</note> subject, gathered by an author of credit and fame sufficient, to this effect. It is not long (saith he) since a friend of mine, a man of a great spirit, and worthy to be beleeved, recounted to me a very strange accident which, he said, hapned to himselfe, and proved his saying by the testimony of many witnesses: which was this: That being upon a time at Naples at a kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans and familiars house of his, he heard by night the voice of a man cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the street for aid, which caused him to rise and light a candle, and run out to see what the matter was: being come out of the doores, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a cruell and ougly shaped divell, striving with all his force to catch and get into his clouches a yong man, that strove on the other side to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himselfe, and for feare raised that outcry which he had before heard: the yong man seeing him, ran to him forthwith, and catching fast hold by his cloathes, and pitifully crying to God, would in no case let go his hold untill his cruell enemy forsooke him: and being brought into the house all dismaied and beside himselfe, would not let go his hold untill he came to his sences againe out of that exceeding feare. The cause of which assault was, he had led all his time a most wicked life, and had been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59545:73"/>
of God, and a Rebell against his parents, using vile railing and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter speeches against them, in such sort, that in stead of blessing, they had layd a curse upon him. And this is the first example.</p>
               <p>Concerning the second, I will also set downe the Authors owne words, as followeth. Of all the strange things (saith he) that ever I heard report of, that which happened not long since at Rome is most worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, of a certaine yong man of Gabia, borne of a base and poore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, but endued with terrible and furious nature, and addicted to a loose and disordinate life. This gallant picking a quarrell with his owne father, in his anger reviled him with most grosse and reprochfull tearmes: In which mad fits, as one wholly given over to the Divell, he purposely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to Rome to practise some naughty device against his father: but his ghostly father the Divell met him in the way, under the shape of a cruell and ougly fellow with a thicke bushie beard, and haire hanging disorderly, and cloathes all rent and tattered; who as they walked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, enquired of him why he was so sad: He answered, that there had passed some bitter speeches betwixt his father and him, and now he devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to work him some mischiefe. The Divell by and by like a crafty knave soothed him up &amp; said, that he also upon the like occasion went about the same practise, and desired that they might pursue both their voyage and enterprise together: it was soone agreed upon betwixt them, being like to like, as the proverbe goeth. Therefore being arrived at Rome, and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at the same Inne, one bed did serve them both; where whilest the yong man securely and soundly slept, the old malicious knave watching his opprtunity, caught him by the throat to strangle him: whereat the poore wretch awoke, and cried for help to God so that the wicked spirit was constrained to forsake him without performing his purpose, and to flee out at the chamber with such force and violence, that the house roofe crackt, and the tyles clattered downe aboundantly. The host of the house being awaked with the noyse, cryed out to know what the matter was, and running into the chamber where this noyse was, with a candle in his hand, found the poore young man all alone betwixt dead and alive, of whom (recovered) he learnt out the whole truth, as hath been told: but he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this terrible accident repented him of his wicked life, and was touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the sence of his grievous sinne so nearly, that ever after he led a more circumspect and honest life. Thus much we finde written in that Author.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth inspired with the furies of the Pope of Rome, made warre upon his father <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, vexing him with cruell and often <note place="margin">

                  </note> battels, and not ceasing till he had spoiled him of his Empire, and till the Bishop of Mentz had proudly and insolently taken from him his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall ornaments even in his presence: but the Lord in recompence of his unnaturall dealing, made him and his army a prey unto his enemies the Saxons, and to flie before them, stirring up also the Pope of Rome to be as grievous a scourge unto him, as he had beene before time to his father. Now as the ambition of a Kingdome was the cause of this mans ingratitude, so in the example following, pride and disdaine ruled, and therefore he is so much the more to be condemned, by how much a Kingdome is a stronger cord to draw men to vice, than a mans owne affection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:59545:73"/>
There was (saith <hi>Manlius)</hi> an old man crooked with age, distressed with poverty, and almost pined with hunger, that had a sonne rich, strong, and fat, of whom he intreated no gold or silver, or possession, but food and <note place="margin">In Collectan.</note> sustenance for his belly, and clothes for his backe, but could not obtaine it at his hands: for his proud heart, exalted with prosperity, thought it a shame and discredit to his house, to be borne of so poore and base paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and therefore not onely denied him reliefe, but also disclaimed him from being his father, and chased him away with bitter and crabbed reproaches. The poore old man thus cruelly handled, let teares fall as witnesse of his griefe, and departed comfortlesse from his Tygre minded sonne. But the Lord that gathereth up the tears of the innocent, looked down from heaven in justice, and sent a fury into the sences and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of this monstrous son, that as he was void of nature and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, so he might bevoid of reason and discretion for ever after.</p>
               <p>Another not so cruell and disdainfull as the former, yet cruell and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull <note place="margin">Manlius in collectan.</note> enough to plucke downe vengeace upon his head, would not see his father beg indeed, nor yet abjure him as the other did; but yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to keepe him, used him more like a slave than a father: for what should be too deare for him that gives us life? yet every good thing was too deare for this poore father, Vpon a time a dainty morsell of meat was upon the boord to be eaten, which as soone as he came in he conveied away, and foisted in courser victuals in the roome. But marke what his <note place="margin">Fides sit apud authorem.</note> dainties turned to: when the servant went to fetch it againe, he found in stead of meat snakes, and of sauce serpents, to the great terrour of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: but that which is more, one of the serpents leaped in his face, and catching hold by his lip, hung there till his dying day, so that hee could never feed himselfe, but he must feed the serpent withall. And this badge carried he about as a cognisance of an unkinde and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sonne.</p>
               <p>Moreover this is another judgment of God, that commonly as children deale with their parents, so doe their children deale with them: and this in the law of proportion is most just, and in the order of punishing most usuall: for the proofe whereof, as experience daily teacheth, so one exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or two I will subjoyne It is reported how a certaine unkind and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse <note place="margin">Thearr. hist,</note> sonne beat his aged father upon a time, and drew him by the haire of his head to the threshold: who when hee was old was likewise beaten of his sonne, and drawne also by the haire of the head not to the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold, but out of doores into the durt; and how hee should say he was rightly served, if he had left him at the threshold, as he left his father, and not dragged him into the streets, which hee did not to his. Thus did his owne mouth beare record of his impiety, and his owne conscience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him before God and men.</p>
               <p>Another old man being persuaded by his son (that had maried a yong <note place="margin">Guiliel. Lugdi. Discipulus de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>emp.</note> wise) with faire and sugred promises of kindnesses and contentments, to surrender his goods and lands unto him, yeelded to his request, and found for a space all things to his desire: but when his often coughing annoyd his yong and dainty wise, he first removed his lodging from a faire high chamber to a base under roome, and after shewed him many other unkinde and unchildly parts: and lastly when the old man as ked for cloathes, he bought foure elnes of cloath, two wherof he bestowed upon him, and reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59545:74"/>
the other two for himselfe. Now his young sonne marking this nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardise of his father towards his grandfather, hid the two elles of cloath, and being asked why hee hid them (whether by ingeniousnesse or instinct of God) he answered, To the end to reserve them for his father, against he was old, to be a covering for him. Which answer touched his father so neere, that ever after hee shewed himselfe more loving and obsequious to his father than he did before. Two great faults, but soone and happily amended. Would it might be an example to all children, if not to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate them, yet at least to learne them to feare how to deale roughly and crookedly with their parents, seeing that God punisheth sinne with sinne, and sinners in their owne kinde, and measureth the same measure to every man which they have measured unto others. The like we read of another <note place="margin">George Lanter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de disciplina liberorum.</note> that provided a trough for his old decrepit unmannerly father to eat his meat in: who being demanded of his sonne also to what use that trough should serve, answered for his grandfather: What (quoth the childe) and must we have the like for you when you are old? Which words so abashed him, that he threw it away forthwith.</p>
               <p>At Millan there was an abstinate and ungodly sonne, that when he was <note place="margin">Theat. hist.</note> admonished by his mother of some fault which he had committed, made a wry mouth, and pointed his fingers at her in scorne and derision. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at his mother being angry, wished that he might make such a mouth upon the gallowes. Neither was it a vaine wish, for within few daies he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mandat.</hi> 3. Cursing. <hi>li.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 33.</note> with a theft, and condemned by law to be hanged; and being upon the ladder, was perceived to wryth his mouth in griefe, after the same fashion which he had done before to his mother in derision.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the second of that name, King of England, sonne of <hi>Geffrey Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagenet,</hi> and <hi>Maud</hi> the Empresse, after he had raigned twenty yeares, was content to admit his young sonne <hi>Henry</hi> (married to <hi>Margaret</hi> the French Kings daughter) into participation of his Crowne: but he like an unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall son to requite his fathers love, sought to dispossesse him of the whole; for by inciting the King of France and certaine other Nobles, hee tooke armes, and raised warre against his owne naturall father: betwixt whom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers strong battels being fought, as well in England by the Deputies and friends of both parties, as also in Normandy, Poytou, Guian, and Britain; the victory alwayes inclined to the father, so that the rebellious son with his allies were constrained to bend to his fathers will, and to desire peace, which he gently granted, and forgave his offence. Howbeit the Lord for his disobedience did not so lightly pardon him, but because his hasty mind could not tarry for the Crowne till his fathers death, therefore the Lord cut him short of it altogether, causing him to die six yeares before his father, being yet but young, and like to live long.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lothair</hi> King of Soissons in France, committed the rule of the province of Guian to his eldest son <hi>Cramiris,</hi> who when (contrary to the mind of his father) he oppressed the people with exactions, and was reclaimed home, he like an ungratious and impious son, fled to his uncle <hi>Childebert,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him towarre upon his owne father, wherein he himselfe was by the just vengeance of God taken, and burned with his wife and children to death.</p>
               <p>Furthermore it is not (doubtlesse) but to a very good end enacted in the law of God, That he which curseth his father or mother should die the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59545:74"/>
death, and that rebellious children and such as be incorrigible, should at the instance and pursuit of their owne parents, by order of law be stoned to death.</p>
               <p>As children by all these examples ought not onely to learne to feare to displease and revile their parents, but also to feare and reverence them, lest that by disobedience they kindle the fire of Gods wrath against them: so likewise on the other side parents are here advertised to have great care in bringing up and instructing their children in the feare of God, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his will; lest for want of instruction and correction on their part, they themselves incurre a punishment of their carelesse negligence in the person of their children. And this is proved by experience of the men of <note place="margin">2 Kin. 2.</note> Bethel, of whose children two and forty were torne in pieces by Beares, for that they had been so evill taught as to mocke the holy Prophet <hi>Elizeus,</hi> in calling him bald-pate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heli</hi> likewise the high priest was culpable of this fault, for having two <note place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 2.</note> wicked and perverse sonnes, whom no feare of God could restraine, being discontent with that honourable portion of the sacrifices allotted them by God, like famished and unsatiable wretches fell to share out more than was their due, and by force to raven all that which by faire meanes they could not get: and that which is worse, to pollute the holy Tabernacle of God with their filthy whoredomes, in such sort, that the Religion of God <note place="margin">Contempt of holy things. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 34.</note> grew in disgrace through their prophane dealings. And albeit it may seem that their father did his duty in some sort, when he admonished and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, yet it is manifest by the reprehension of the man of God, that he did no part of that at all, or if he did, yet it was in so carelesse, loose, and cold manner, using more lenity than hee ought, or lesse severity than was necessary, that God turned their destructions (when they were slaine at the overthrow of Israel by the Philistins) to be his punishment: for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the dolefull newes of his sonnes death, and the Arkes taking, at once, he fell backewards from his stoole, and burst his necke, being old and heavy, even fourescore and eighteene yeares of age, not able either to help or stay himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> also was not free from this offence; for hee so much cockered <note place="margin">a Kin. 1. 16.</note> some of his children, that they proved the greatest plagues and scourges unto him, especially <hi>Absolon</hi> and <hi>Adonijah:</hi> for the one openly rebelled against him, and almost drove him out of his kingdome; the other usurped the title and honour of the kingdome before his fathers death: of this it is recorded. That <hi>David</hi> so cockered and pampered him, that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver displease him from his youth. But see how he was punished in them for this too great lenity; both of them came to an untimely death, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not onely the workers of their owne destruction, but also great crosses to their father.</p>

This history is recorded in the Annales of the aforenamed city, and avouched to be most true; being a notable and fearefull admonition to all parents, to set their children to learning and instruction, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them from all such vaine and foolish pastimes.</p>

Wherefore two Cannons belonging to the Bishop, sought to undermine this their enemy by policy, and to take him out of the way: for which
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59545:76"/>
end they invited him in very kind manner to dinner, but when he was come they brought him into a young lyons denne (which they kept in honour of the Bishop) and unawares shut the doores upon him, bidding him shift for himselfe, thinking that it was impossible for him to escape out alive.</p>
               <p>But the Consull perceiving in what great danger he was, wrapped his cloake about his left arme, and thrusting it into the mouth of the hungry Lion, killed him with his right hand, and so by the wonderfull providence of God, escaped without hurt. But the two traiterous Canons he caught right soone, and hung them at their Cathedrall Church, to their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, and tertor of all traitors.</p>
               <p>It was noble saying, and worthy the marking, of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> to <hi>Rami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talches</hi> King of Thracia, who having forsaken <hi>Anthony,</hi> to take part with <hi>Augustus,</hi> boasted very insolently of his deserts towards him: then <hi>Caesar</hi> dissembling his folly, dranke to another King, and said, I love treason, but I cannot commend nor trust a traitour. The same also in effect <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedony and <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> were wont to say, That they loved a traitour at the first, but when hee had finished his treason, they hated him more than any other: signifying, that traitours deserved no retribution of thankes, seeing their office was accepted for a time, yet they themselves could never be counted lesse than naughty and disloyall persons: for no honest man ever betrayed his countrey or his friend: and what greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment can there be than this? But for manifest proofe hereof let this one example serve in stead of many, namely, of <hi>Theodoricke</hi> King of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, <note place="margin">Albert. Crantz</note> and <hi>Irminfride</hi> King of Thuringia, who being profest foes, and having sought many cruell battels, at length the latter was conquered of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by the lucky assistance of the Saxons. This <hi>Irminfride</hi> thus subdued, sued for pardon and release at the conquerours hand, but hee was so farre from pittying his estate, that he corrupted one <hi>Iringus</hi> a Nobleman, and <hi>Irminfride's</hi> subject, to murther his master, which he performed kneeling before <hi>Theodoricke,</hi> running him through with his sword at his backe: which traiterous deed, as soone as it was finished, <hi>Theodoricke,</hi> though the setter of it, yet he could not abide the actour, but bad him be packing, for who could put trust in him that had betrayed his owne master? At which words <hi>Iringus</hi> (mad with anger and rage) ranne at <hi>Theodericke</hi> also with purpose to have slaine him too; but his hand missing the marke, returned his sword into his owne bowels, so that he fell down dead upon his masters carkasse. What more notable and wonderfull judgement could happen? surely it is an example worthy to be written in golden letters, and to bee read and remembred of every one, to teach men allegiance and obedience to their Princes and Superiors, lest more sudden destruction than this fall upon them.</p>
               <p>After the death of <hi>Ieronimus</hi> King of Siracuse, <hi>Andronodorus</hi> and <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stius,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Tit.

And when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, how their wives <hi>Damarata</hi> and <hi>Harmonia</hi> were breeders and incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of this mischiefe, they sent to kill them also; yea and <hi>Heraclia, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia</hi> her sister, guiltlesse and witlesse of the crime (for no other cause,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59545:77"/>
but because shee was sister unto her) was pluckt from the Altar, and slain in the tumult, with two of her daughters that were virgins. And thus is treason plagued not only in traitors themselves, but also in those that are linked unto them in friendship and affinity.</p>
               <p>The glory and reputation of <hi>Fabritius</hi> the Roman is eternised by that noble act of his, in sending bound to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> a traitor that offered to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note place="margin">

               <p>What notable treasons did <hi>Hadrian</hi> the fourth, Pope of Rome, practise against the Emperor <hi>Frederick Barbarossa,</hi> yet all was still frustrate; for the Lord protected the Emperour, and punished the traitour with a sudden and strange death; for he was choaked with a flie which went downe his throat and stopped his breath, and could by no meanes be pulled out till it made an end of him. Besides, many others that went about the same pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, were brought to notable destructions: as that counterfeit foole whom the Italians set on to murder <hi>Fredericke</hi> in his chamber, which had been performed, had he not leaped out of a window into a river, and so saved his life: for the foole being taken, was throwne headlong out of the same window and broke his neeke. As also an Arabian Doctor, a grand poysoner, who going about to infect with poyson his bridle, his saddle, his spurres, and stirrops, that as soone as he should but touch them, hee might be poysoned, was discovered and hanged for his labour.</p>
               <p>In the yeare of our Lord 1364, when as the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the <note place="margin">Albert. Crantz</note> fourth, and <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of Austria, were ready to joyne battell in the field, <hi>Charles</hi> distrusting his owne power, undermined his foe by subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on this fashion: he sent for three of Duke <hi>Philips</hi> captaines privily, and persuaded them with promises of rewards to worke some meanes to terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Duke, and dissuade him from that battell: which they performed with all diligence; for they told the Duke, that they had stolne into the Emperours tents by night, and viewed his power, which they found to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed his by three parts, and therefore counselled him not to try the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of the battell, but to save his souldiers lives by flight, which if they tarried, they were sure to loose. Wherewithall the Duke mistrusting no fraud, sore affrighted, tooke the next occasion of flight, and returned home with dishonour. Now when these three traitors came to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour for their compacted rewards, he caused them to bee payed in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit money, not equivaling the summe of their bargaine by the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth part: which although at first they discerned not, yet afterwards finding how they were cousened, they returned to require their due, and complaine of their wrong. But the Emperor looking sternely upon them, answered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That counterfeit money was good enough for their counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit service, and that if they tarried long, they should have a due reward of their treason.</p>

               <p>To rehearse all the English traitors that have conspired against their <note place="margin">Lanquet.</note> Kings from the Conquest unto this day, it is a thing unnecessary, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most impossible. Howbeit, that their destructions may appeare more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and the curse of God upon traitors be made more manifest, I will briefely reckon up a catalogue of the chiefest of them. In the yere 1295 <hi>Lewline</hi> Prince of Wales rebelled against King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, and after much adoe, was taken by Sir <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> and his head set upon the Tower of London.

Thus they rebelled in <hi>Henry</hi> the sixths time, and also <hi>Henry</hi> the eights, and divers other kings reignes, ever when our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish forces were busied about forraine wars, invading the land on the other side most traiterously.</p>
               <p>In the reigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth there rebelled at one time against him Sir <hi>Iohn Holland,</hi> D. of Excester, with the Dukes of Aumarle, Surrey, <note place="margin">Lanquet.</note> Salisbury, and Gloucester: and at another time Sir <hi>Thomas Percy</hi> Earle of Worcester, and <hi>Henry Percy</hi> son to the Earle of Northumberland: at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sir <hi>Richard Scroope</hi> Archbishop of Yorke, and divers others of the house of the Lord <hi>Moubray:</hi> at another time Sir <hi>Henry Percy</hi> the father, Earle of Northumberland, and the Lord <hi>Bardolph:</hi> and lastly, <hi>Ryce ap Dee</hi> and <hi>Owen Glendour,</hi> two Welchmen: all which were either slaine, as Sir <hi>Henry Percy</hi> the younger; or beheaded, as the rest of these noble Rebels; or starved to death, as <hi>Owen Glendour</hi> was in the mountaines of Wales, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had devoured his owne flesh.</p>
               <p>In the reigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, Sir <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of Cambridge, Sir <hi>Richard Scroope</hi> Treasurer of England, and Sir <hi>Thomas Gray</hi> were beheaded for treason.</p>
               <p>No lesse was the perfidious and ungratefull treachery of <hi>Humphry Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister</hi> an Englishman towards the Duke of Buckingham his Lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, whom the said Duke had tenderly brought up, and exalted to great promotion, For when as the Duke being driven into extremity, by reason of the separation of his army which he had mustered together against King <hi>Richard</hi> the usurper, fled to the same <hi>Banister</hi> as his trustiest friend, to be kept in secret untill he could find opportunity to escape; this false traitor, upon hope of a thousand pounds which was promised to him that could bring forth the Duke, betraied him into the hands of <hi>Iohn Mitton</hi>

Shirife of Shropshire, who conveied him to the city of Salisbury, where King <hi>Richard</hi> kept his houshold; where he was soone after put to death.

               <p>To passe over the time of the residue of the Kings, where in many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of treasons and punishments upon them are extant, and to come nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer unto our owne age, let us consider the wonderfull providence of God in discovering the notorious treasons which have been so oftenpretended, and so many, against our late Soveraigne Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting her so fatherly from the dint of them all. First therefore, to begin with the chiefest, the Earles of Northumberland and Westmerland, in the eleventh yeare of her raigne began a rebellion in the North, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their purpose to be sometimes to defend the Queenes person and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from the invasion of strangers, and sometimes for conscience sake to seeke reformation of Religion: under colour whereof they got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether an army of men, to the number of six thousand souldiers; against whom marched the Earle of Suffex, Lieutenant of the North, and the Earle of Warwicke, sent by the Queene to his ayde: Whose approch strucke such a terrour into their hearts, that the two Earles, with divers of the arch Rebels, fled by night into Scotland, leaving the rest of their company a prey unto their enemies, whereof threescore and six, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, were hanged at Durham. As for the Earles, one of them (to wit) of Northumberland, was after taken in Scotland, and beheaded at York. Westmerland fled into another Countrey, and left his house and family destroyed and undone by his folly.</p>
               <p>A while after this, what befell to <hi>Iohn Throgmorton, Thomas Brooke, George Redman,</hi> and divers other Gentlemen at Norwich, who pretended a rebellion under the color of suppressing strangers, were they not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by one of their owne conspiracy <hi>Thomas Ket,</hi> and executed at Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich for their paines? The same end came <hi>Francis Throgmorton</hi> to, whose trecheries as they were abhominable, and touching the Queens owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, so they were disclosed not without the especiall providence of God.</p>
               <p>But above all, that vile and ungratefull traitor <hi>William Parry,</hi> upon whom the Queene had powred plentifully her liberality, deserveth to be had in everlasting remembrance to his shame; whose treasons being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, he payed the tribute of his life in recompence thereof. What shall I say of the Earle of Arundell, and a second Earle of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land? Did not the justice of God appeare in both their ends, when being attainted for treason, the one slew himselfe in prison, and the other died by course of nature in prison also? Notorious was the conspiracy of those arch traitours, <hi>Ballard, Babington, Savadge,</hi> and <hi>Tylney,</hi> &amp;c. yet the Lord brought them downe, and made them spectacles to the World of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. Even so that notorious villaine Doctor <hi>Lopez</hi> (the Queenes Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian)
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59545:79"/>
who a long time had not onely beene an intelligencer to the Pope and King of Spaine of our English Counsells, but also had poisoned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Noblemen, and went about also to poyson the Queene her selfe, was he not surprised in his treachery, and brought to sudden destruction? In summe, the Lord preserved her Majesty not only from these, but many other secret and privy foes, and that most miraculously, and contrary to all reason, and spread his wings over her, evermore to defend her from all her enemies, and in despight of them all brought her, being full of yeares, in peace to her grave: All these treasons had their breeding and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from that filthy sinke of Romish superstition, from whence the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was conveied into the hearts of these traiterous wretches, by the means of those common firebrands of the Christian World, the wicked Iesuites, whose chiefest art is Treason, and whose profession is equivocation, and practise, to stir up rebellion; and therefore as long as they breath in the world let us looke for no better fruits from such trees.</p>
               <p>And hath the reigne of our now Soveraigne King <hi>Iames</hi> beene free from these Sinons? He hath as yet swayed the Scepter of this Kingdome not fully nine yeres, and how many treasons have beene complotted and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised against his Majesty and the State, and how miraculously hath the Lord preserved him evermore, even as the apple of his eye, and the signet on his right hand. To omit the treason of <hi>Raleigh</hi> and <hi>Cobham,</hi> and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of <hi>Watson</hi> and <hi>Clerke,</hi> that late and last divellish and damnable practise of blowing up the Parliament house with gunpowder, together with the King, Prince, and all the Nobles and chiefe Pillars of the Land, is never to be omitted nor forgotten, but to be remembred as long as the Sunne and Moone endureth, to the shame of their religion, and the professours thereof: never Nation so barbarous, that ever practised the like: never any religion so odious, that maintained the like: but such are the fruits of their so much advanced religion, such the clusters of their grapes: How be it the Lord prevented their malice, and turned it upon their owne pates, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a Divine and miraculous discovery of their treason (the very night before it should have beene effected) but also by bringing the chiefe plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thereof unto confusion; some by the ordinary proceeding of justice, and some by slaughter in resistance: and that which is not to bee overpast, some of the principall of them being together in a chamber, were so scorched by their owne powder, which was in drying, that they were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to confesse the heavy judgement of God to be upon them. I pray God such may ever bee the end of all traitours, and that the religion which bringeth forth such horrible fruits may not onely be suspected but abhorred of all.</p>
               <p>Moreover, there is yet another kind of treason, and another ranke of traitors as pernitious as any of the former, and as odious before God and man. Such are they which either upon private quarrels, or received inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or hope of gaine, or any other silly respect, forsake their countries, and take part with the enemies to fight against it: or they that in time of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity refuse to fight, or dare not fight in defence of it: the former sort are called fugitives, &amp; the latter cowards. As touching the first, they havebeen alwayes in detestation in well governed Policies, and also evermore se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely punished. The Aeginates punished them with the losse of their right hand thumbs, to the end they might no more handle a speare or a sword,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59545:79"/>
but an oare: the Mitylenians with losse of their lives: the inhabitants of Samos marked them in the face with the picture of an Owle: and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans punished them after divers fashions. <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> caused all those that had fled from the Roman succours to the enemy to lose their hands. <hi>Africanus</hi> the former, though gentle and mild by nature, yet in <note place="margin">Valerius Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus.</note> this respect he borrowed from forreine cruelty: for having conquered Carthage, and got into his power all those Romane Rebels that tooke part against his countrey, he hung the Romans as traitors to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and mitigated the punishment of the Latines, as but perfidious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates. <hi>Africanus</hi> the later, when hee had subdued the Punicke Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he threw all fugitives amongst wilde beasts to be devoured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucius Paulus</hi> aftor the conquest of the King of Persia, committed these fellowes to the mercy of Elephants. Generally there is no Nation under the Sunne which holdeth them not in execration: and therefore our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish fugitives, who under cloke of Religion not onely abandon their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, their kindred, and their Prince, but also conspire the undoing, and sweare the destruction of them, are they not worthy to be handled like traitours, and to have their quarters spectacles of perfidy? The bridge and gates of London beare witnesse of the wofull ends that these runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates come unto.</p>
               <p>As touching cowards (I meane such as preferring their lives or liberty, or any other by-respects, before their countries welfare, and either dare not or will not stand stoutly in defence of it in time of warre and danger) they deserve no lesse punishment than the former, seeing that as they are open oppugners, so these are close underminers of the good thereof. And therefore the Romanes did sharpely chasten them in their government, as may appeare by diverse examples of the same: as first they were noted with this ignominy, never to eat their meat but standing; and hereunto they were sworne: Nay, they were in such hatefull account amongst them, that when <hi>Annibal</hi> offered the Senate 8000 captives to be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they refused his offer; saying, That they were not worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, <note place="margin">Alex. ab Alex.</note> that had rather be taken basely than die honestly and valiantly: The same Senate dealt more favourably with the captives which King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> tooke, for they redeemed them, but with this disgrace, degrading them from their honours and places, untill by a double spoile they had woon their reputation againe. <hi>L. Calpurnius Piso</hi> handled <hi>Titius</hi> the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of his horsemen in Sicilia (one who being overcharged with ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, delivered his weapons unto them) on this manner, he caused him to goe bare footed before the army, wearing a garment without seames, he forbad him society with any save such as were noted with the same <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Valerius Max. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> fault, and from a Generall over horsemen he debased him to a common souldier. How did the same Senate correct the cowardise of <hi>Caius Vatie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> (who to the end to priviledge himselfe from the Italicke warre, cut off all the fingers of his left hand:) even they proscribed his goods, and cast him into perpetuall prison, that that life which hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to hazard in defence of his countrey, he might consume in bondage and fetters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fulgosius</hi> saith, That among the Germanes it was so unhonourable <note place="margin">

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59545:80"/>
the temples of Religion; insomuch, that many (as he reporteth) killed themselves to avoid the shame. The people called Daci punished cowards on this sort: they suffered them not to sleepe but with their heads to the beds feet-ward; and besides, by the law they made them slaves and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to their owne wives. What viler disgrace could there be than this? And yet the Lacedemonians plagued them more shamefully: for with <note place="margin">Phi. Agesilaus.</note> them it was a discredit to marry in the stocke of a coward; any man might strike them lawfully; and in their attire they went with their clothes rent, and their beards halfe shaven. Thus are all kind of traitors continually pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished of the Lord by one meanes or other; and therefore let us learne to shun treason as one of the vilest and detestablest things in the world.</p>

               <p>In the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the second and <hi>Edward</hi> the third in England, one Sir <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> committed many villanous outrages in shedding <note place="margin">Lanquet.</note> much bloud, and at last King <hi>Edward</hi> himselfe, lying at Barkley castle, to the end that he might (as it was supposed) enjoy <hi>Isabel</hi> his wife, with whom he had very suspitious familiarity. After this, he unjustly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Edmund</hi> Earle of Kent of treason, and caused him to bee put to death therefore: and lastly, he conspired against King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, as it was suspected, for which cause he was worthily and deservedly beheaded.</p>
               <p>Among this ranke of murtherers of Kings we may fitly place also <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the third, usurper of the Crowne of England, and divers others <note place="margin">Stow.</note> which he used as instruments to bring his detestable purpose to effect: as namely Sir <hi>Iames Tirrèl</hi> Knight, a man for natures gifts worthy to have served a much better Prince than this <hi>Richard,</hi> if he had well served God, and beene endued with as much truth and honesty as he had strength and wit: also <hi>Miles Forest,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Dighton</hi> two villaines fleshed in murthers. But to come to the fact, it was on this sort: When <hi>Richard</hi> the usurper had enjoyned <hi>Robert Brackenbury</hi> to this piece of service of murthering the young King <hi>Edward</hi> the fifth, his Nephew, in the Tower, with his brother the Duke of Yorke, and saw it refused by him: he committed the charge of the murther to Sir <hi>Iames Tirrel;</hi> who hasting to the Tower, by the Kings Commission received the keyes into his owne hands, and by the helpe of those two butchers, <hi>Dighton</hi> and <hi>Forest,</hi> smothered the two Princes in their bed, and buried them at the staires feet: which being done, Sir <hi>Iames</hi> rode back to king <hi>Richard,</hi> who gave him great thankes, and as some say, made him knight for his labour. All which things on every part well pondered, it appeareth, that God never gave the world a notabler example, both of the unconstancy of worldly w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

dead, his haire in despight torne and tugged like a dog: besides, the inward torments of his guilty conscience were more than all the rest: for it is most certainly reported, That after this abhominable deed hee never had quiet in his minde; when he went abroad, his eye whirled about, his body was privily fenced, his hand ever upon his dagger, his countenance and manner like one alwaies ready to strike, his sleep short and unquiet, full of fearefull dreames, insomuch that he would often suddenly start up and leap out of his bed, and runne about his chamber, his restlesse consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was so continually tossed and tumbled with the tedious impression of that abhominable murther.</p>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59545:82"/>
lost in the battell six and thirty thousand men that were slaine, beside a great number that were taken prisoners.</p>
               <p>Two yeares after this Flemmish stirre, there arose a great commotion <note place="margin">The same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</note> and hurly burly of the rascall and basest sort of people at Paris, because of the alteration of their coines: who being not satisfied with the pillage and spoilage of their houses, whom they supposed to be either causes of the said alteration, or by counsell or other meanes any furtherers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, came in great troupes before the Kings Palace, at his lodging in the Temple, with such an hideous noise and outrage, that all the day after, neither the King nor any of his officers durst once stir over the threshold: nay they grew to that overflow of pride and insolency, that the victuals which were provided for the Kings diet, and carried to him, were by them shamefully throwne under feet in the dirt, and trampled upon in despight and disdaine. But three or foure daies after this tumult was appeased, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them for their pains were hanged before their own doores, and in the city gates, to the number of eight and twenty persons.</p>
               <p>In the raigne of <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth, the Parisians (by reason of a certaine taxe which he minded to lay upon them) banded themselves and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together against him: they determined once (saith <hi>Froissard)</hi> to have beaten downe Loure, and S.

                     <hi>Vol</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 120.</note> about Paris, that they might not be offensive to them. But the King (though young in yeares) handled them so ripe and handsomely, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken away from them their armor, the city gates and chaines of the streets, and locked up their weapons in S. Vincents castle, hee dealt with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 129.</note> them as pleased him. And thus their pride being quashed, many of them were executed and put to death: As also for the like rebellion were at <note place="margin">

               <p>About the same time the Flandrians, and especially the inhabitants of Gaunt wrought much trouble against <hi>Lewis</hi> the Earle of Flanders, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <note place="margin">

The matter came to be decided by blowes, and much bloud was shed, and many losses endured on both sides, as a meanes appointed of God to chastise as well the one as the other. The Gaunts being no more in number than five or six thousand men, overthrew the <note place="margin">

And thus he fared till King <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth sent an army of men to his succor (for he was his subject) by whose support he overcame those Rebels <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Nic. Gil. vol.</hi> 2.</note> countrey being brought againe into the obedience of their old Lord.</p>
               <p>A while before this, whilest King <hi>Iohn</hi> was held prisoner in England, there arose a great commotion of the common people in France, against <note place="margin">

                  </gap>on to nine thousand, that ranged and robbed throughout all Brie, along by the river Marne to Laonoise, and all about Soissons, armed with
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59545:82"/>
great bats shod with yron: an headlesse crue without Governour, fully purposing to bring to ruine the whole nobility. In this disorder they wrought much mischiefe, broke up many houses and castles, murthered many Lords; so that divers Ladies and Knights, as the Duchesses of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy &amp; Orleance, were fain to fly for safegard to Meaux: whither when these Rebels would needs pursue them, they were there overthrown, killed, and hanged by troups.</p>
               <p>In the yeare of our Lord 1525, there were certain husbandmen of Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sleid. lib.</hi> 4.</note> that began to stand in resistance against the Earle of Lupsfen, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of certaine burthens which they complained themselves to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid with by him: their neighbors seeing this, enterprised the like against their Lords: And so upon this small beginning (by a certaine contagion) there grew up a most dangerous and fearefull commotion, that spread it selfe almost over all Almaine: the sedition thus increasing in all quarters, and the swaines being now full forty thousand strong, making their owne liberty and the Gospels a cloake to cover their treason and rebellion, and a pretence of their undertaking armes (to the wonderfull griefe of all that feared God) did not onely fight with the Romane Catholickes, but with all other without respect, as well in Souabe as in Franconia: they destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the greater part of the Nobility, sacked and burnt many castles and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses, to the number of two hundred, and put to death the Earle of Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, in making him passe through their pikes. But at length their strength was broken, they discomfited and torn in pieces with a most horrible mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre of more than eighteen thousand of them. During this sedition there were slaine on each side fifty thousand men. The captaine of the Souabian swaines called <hi>Geismer,</hi> having betaken himselfe to flight, got over the mountaines of Padua, where by treason he was made away.</p>
               <p>In the yeare of our Lord 1517, in the Marquesdome of the Vandales, the like insurrection and rebellion was of the commonalty, especially the baser sort, against the Nobility, Spirituall, and Temporall, by whom they were oppressed with intolerable exactions: their army was numbred of ninety thousand men all clowns and husbandmen, that conspired together to redresse and reforme their owne grievances, without any respect of civill Magistrate, or feare of Almighty God. This rascality of swaines raged and tyranized every where, burning and beating down the castles and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Noblemen, and making their ruines even with the ground: Nay, they handled the Noblemen themselves, as many as they could attaine unto, not contumeliously only, but rigorously and cruelly, for they tormented them to death, and carried their heads upon speares, in token of victory. Thus they swayed a while uncontrolled, for the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> winked at their riots, as being acquainted with what in juries they had been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged: but when he perceived that the rude multitude did not limit their fury within reason, but let it runne too lavish to the damnifying as well the innocent as the guilty, he made out a small troup of mercinary souldiers, together with a band of horsemen, to suppresse them, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to a city were presently so environed with such a multitude of these swaines, that like locusts overspread the earth, that they thought it impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to escape with their lives; wherefore feare and extremity made them to rush out to battell with them. But see how the Lord prospereth a good cause, for all their weak number in comparison of their enemies, yet such a
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59545:83"/>
feare possessed their enemies hearts, that they fled like troups of sheep, and were slaine like dogges before them: insomuch, that they that escaped the sword, were either hanged by flocks on trees, or rosted on spits by fires, or otherwise tormented to death. And this end befell that wicked rebellious rout, which wrought such mischiefe in that country, with their monstrous villanies, that the traces and steppes thereof remaine at this day to bee seene.</p>
               <p>In the yeare of our Lord 1381, <hi>Richard</hi> the second being King, the Commons of England (and especially of Kent and Essex) by meanes of a <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Stow</hi> Chron.</note> taxe that was set upon them, suddenly rebelled, and assembled together on Blackheath, to the number of 60000 or more: which rebellious rout had none but base and ignoble fellowes for their captaines; as <hi>Wat Tiler, Iacke Straw, Tom Miller,</hi> but yet they caused much trouble and disquietnesse in the Realme, and chiefly about the city of London, where they committed much villany, in destroying many goodly places, as the Savoy, and others; and being in Smithfield, used themselves very proudly and unreverently towards the King: but by the manhood and wisedome of <hi>William Walworth,</hi> Major of London (who arrested their chiefe captain in the midst of them) that rude company was discomfited, and the ringleaders of them worthily punished.</p>
               <p>In like manner in the raigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, a great commotion was stirred up in England by the Commons of the North, by reason of a <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Stow</hi> Chron.</note> certaine taxe which was levied of the tenth peny of all mens lands and goods within the land; in the which the Earle of Northumberland was slain; but their rash attempt was soon broken, and <hi>Chamberlain</hi> their captain with divers other hanged at Yorke, for the same. Howbeit their example feared not the Cornishmen from rebelling upon the like occasion of a tax, under the conduct of the Lord Audley, untill by woefull experience they felt the same scourge: for the King met them upon Blackheath, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfiting their troups, took their captaines and ring leaders, and put them to most worthy and sharp death.</p>
               <p>Thus we may see the unhappy issue of all such seditious revoltings, and thereby gather how unpleasant they are in the sight of God. Let all the people therefore learne by these experiences to submit themselves in the feare of God to the higher powers, whether they be Lords, Kings, Princes, or any other that are set over them.</p>

                  <hi>his owne Image:</hi> which he would not have to be basely accounted of, but deare and precious unto us. If then the bruit and unreasonable creatures <note place="margin">Exod. 21.</note> are not exempted from the sentence of death pronounced in the law, if they chance to kill a man: how much more punishable then is man, endued with will and reason, when malitiously and advisedly he taketh away the life of his neighbour? But the hainousnesse and greatnesse of this sinne is most lively expressed by that ordinance of God set downe in the 21 of <hi>Deutronomy,</hi> where it is enjoyned, That if a man be found slain in the field, <note place="margin">Deut. 21.</note> and it be not knowne who it was that slew him, then the Elders and Iudges of the next towne assembling together, should offer up an expiatory sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by the hands of the Priests, to demand pardon for that cruell murther, that the guilt of innocent bloud might not be imputed unto them. And if by oversight or negligence without any malice, hatred, or pretence, one killed another, yet was he not exempted from all punishment, but suffered to fly to the city of refuge, to be kept, and as it were inclosed untill his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency <note place="margin">Num. 35.</note> were made manifest, or at the least untill the death of the high Priest. From this (it may seeme) arose the custome of Painims in the like case; which was, that if a man had unwillingly committed murther, he did presently avoid the countrey, and goe unto some man of power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a strange nation, and present himselfe at his gate, sitting with his face covered, humbly intreating pardon and reconciliation for his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and for one whole yeare he might not returne into his countrey. On this manner was the sonne of a certaine King of Phrygia entertained in King <hi>Craesus</hi> court, who unadvisedly had slaine his owne brother. Whereby <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Herod. lib.</hi> 1.</note> it is manifest, how odious and execrable in all ages, and all places, and all people, this murther hath been: insomuch that men did shun their very meeting and company, and abandon them out of their temples and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke assemblies, as people excommunicate and prophane. And yet for all this, mankinde (for the most part) like savage beasts hath by the instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that wicked spirit (who was a murtherer from the beginning) been too too addicted to this kind of cruelty, not being afraid to offer violence to nature, and shed innocent bloud. Such was the franticke and perverse cruelty of the second man <hi>Cain,</hi> when without any occasion, but onely <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> through envy, he slew his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> and that traiterously: which deed, albeit it was done in secret and without the view of men, yet it could not shun the piercing eye of God, who reproved him for it, saying, <hi>That the bloud of Abel cried for vengeance from the earth.</hi> And although this cursed and wicked murtherer received not immediately a condigne punishment an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to his crime (God to the end to spare mans bloud, using undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved favour towards him) yet escaped hee not scot free, for he was pursued with a continuall torment and sting of confcience, together with such an incessant feare, that he became a vagabond and a runnagate upon the earth: and seeing himselfe brought into so miserable an estate, he fell to complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the punishment was greater than he was able to beare. Thus God permitted this wretch to draw out his life in such anguish, that for a greater punishment he might pine away the rest of his daies without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. A man may find in this world many such brother murthering <hi>Cains,</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:59545:84"/>
who for no occasion sticke not to cut their throats, whom (for the bond of common nature wherein all men are linked together as branches to one root) they ought to acknowledge for their brethren and friends: upon whom the heavy hand of God hath not beene more slacke to punish either by one meanes or other, than it was upon their eldest brother <hi>Cain.</hi> But seeing the number of them is so great, and it is not so convenient to heape up here so huge a multitude together, it shall suffice onely to recount the most famous and notablest of them, as of those that have beene men of note and reputation of the world, or that through an ambitious desire of raigning, have by armes sought to atchieve their purposes: for these for the most part are the greatest murtherers and butchers of all, that through their wicked affections, worldly pompe, or desire of revenge, have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse of making the bloud of men run like rivers upon the earth, making no more account of the life of a man, than of a flie or a worme.</p>
               <p>Such an one was <hi>Abimelech</hi> one of the sonnes of <hi>Gedeon,</hi> who to the end <note place="margin">Iudg. 9.</note> to usurpe the regiment of the people, (which his father before him refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) got together a rout of rascal and vile fellowes, by whose aid comming to his fathers house, he slew seventy of his brethren, even all except <hi>Ioa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> the yongest, that stole away and hid himselfe. After which massacre, he raigned in jolity three yeares, and at the end thereof was cut short by God, together with the Sichemites his provokers and maintainers, who were also guilty of all the innocent bloud which he had shed: for God sent the spirit of division betwixt them, so that the Sichemites began to despise him, and rebell against him; but they had the worst end of the staffe, and were overcome by him: who pursuing the victory, tooke their city by force, and put them all to the edge of the sword. And after he had thus destroied their city, put fire also to the castle, wherein he consumed neere about a thousand persons of men and women, that were retired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to save their lives. And thus God brought upon them the mischiefe which they had consented and put their hands unto: for as they had lent him aid and furtherance to the shedding of his brethrens bloud, so was their owne bloud with their wives and childrens shed by him: yet this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran not content therewith, made war also with the inhabitants of Tebez, and tooke their city, and would have forced the tower also, wherein the citisens had inclosed themselves; but as he approched to the wall, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man threw downe a piece of a milstone upon his head, wherewith finding himselfe hurt to death, he commanded one of his soldiers to kill him outright. And thus this wicked murtherer that had shed the bloud of many men, yea of his owne brethren, had his braines knockt out by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and died a most desperate death.</p>

                  <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> king of Epire that raigned not long after <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, was naturally disposed to such a quicknes and heat of courage, that he could never be quiet but when he was either doing some mischiefe to another, or when another was doing some unto him: ever devising some new practise of molestation for pastimes sake. This his wilde and dangerous disposition began first to shew it selfe in the death of <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> who was conjoyned king with him, whom having bidden to supper in his lodging under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of sacrifice to his gods, he deceitfully slew: preventing by that meanes <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> pretended purpose of poysoning him when occasion should serve. After this he conquered Macedonia by armes, and came into Italie to make war with the Romans, in the behalfe of the Tarentines, and gave them battel in the field, and slew fifteen thousand of them in one day: he took their camp, revoked many cities from their alliance, and spoyled much of their countrey even to the walls of Rome: and all this in a trice without breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Againe by Ascolie he encountred them the second time, where there was a great overthrow of each side of fifteene thousand men: but the Romanes had the worst, and tooke their heeles. When hee was intreated by the Sicilian embassadors to lend them aid to expulse the Carthaginians out of their Isle, hee yeelded presently and chased them out. Being recalled by the Tarentines into Italy for their succour, he was conquered by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes after he had made war upon them six yeres. At his returne to Epire he re-entred by violence Macedonia, tooke many places, overcame the army of king <hi>Antigonus</hi> that resisted him, &amp; had all the whole realm rendred into his hand. Being intreated by <hi>Cleominus</hi> to make war upon Sparta, to the end tore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>install him in his kingdome which he was deprived of: forthwith he mustered his forces, besieged the citie, and spoyled and wasted all the whole country. Afterwards there being a sedition raised in the city of Argos betweene two of the chiefest citizens, one of the which sent unto him for aid, he (what issue soever was like to ensue, whether victory or vanquishment) could not abide in peace from disquieting others and himselfe, but must needs go to take part in that sedition: but to his cost, even to his destruction.

                  </gap> being arrived by night, and finding a gate left open for him to enter by, by the meanes of him that had sent for him to his aid, hee put his souldiers in, and possessed himselfe of the towne incontinently. But the city being aided by <hi>Antigonus</hi> and the King of Sparta, charged and pressed him so sore, that he sought meanes to retire out of the same, but could not. At which time being about to strike a young man of the city that had done him some hurt, his mother being aloft upon the roofe of an house, perceiving his intent, threw downe a tile with both her hands upon his head, and hit him such a knocke upon the necke through default of his armour, that it so bruised his joynts, that he fell into a sudden swound, and lost his sight, his raines falling out of his hand, and he himselfe tumbling from his saddle upon the ground, which when some of the soldiers perceived, they drew him out of the gate, and there, to make an end of the tragedy, cut off his head.</p>
               <p>The cruelty of the Ephori was marvellous strange, when being unwilling once to heare the equality of lands and possessions to be named, which <hi>Agis</hi>

But it cost them very deare: for <hi>Cleamenes</hi> who was joynt King with <hi>Agis,</hi> albe it he had consented to the weaving of that web himself, to the end he might raigne alone; yet cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed he not to prosecute revenge upon them, which hee did not onely by his daily and usuall practises openly, but also privily; for taking them once at advantage, being at supper all together, hee caused his men to kill them sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly as they fat. And thus was the good King <hi>Agis</hi> revenged. But this last murtherer which was fullied and polluted with so much bloud, he went not long unpunished for his misdeeds: for soone after, <hi>Antigonus</hi> King of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia gave him a great overthrow in a battell, wherein hee lost Sparta his chiefe city, and fled into Aegypt for succour: where after small abode, upon an accusation laid against him, he was cast into prison, and though he esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out with his company by cunning and craft, yet as he walked up and down Alexandria in armor, in hope that through his seditious practises the citizens would take his part, and help to restore him to his liberty; when he perceived it was nothing so, but that every man forsooke him, and that there was no hope left of recovery, he commanded his men to kill one another, as they did. In which desperate rage and fury he himselfe was slain, &amp; his body being found, was commanded by King <hi>Ptolomey</hi> to be hangd on a gibbet, and his mother, wives, and children that came with him into Aegypt, to bee put to death. And this was the tragicall end of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> King of Sparta.</p>

In his cruelty he buried some alive, others he clothed in beares and boares skins, and then set dogs at their tailes to rend them in pieces; others hee used
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59545:86"/>
in way of pastime to strike through with darts and arrowes. And one day as the inhabitants of a certaine city were assembled together in counsell, he caused his guard to inclose them up suddenly, and to kill them all even to the very infants. He slew also his owne uncle, and crowned the speare wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he did that deed with garlands of flowers, and sacrificed unto him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, as to a god. Now albeit this cruell Tygre was garded continually with troupes of souldiers that kept night and day watch about his body wheresoever hee lay, and with a most ougly and terrible dog, unacquainted with any saving himselfe, his wife, and one servant that gave him his meat, tied to his chamber dore, yet could hee not escape the evill chance which by his wives meanes fell upon him: for she taking away the staires of his chamber, let in three of her owne brethren provided to murther him, as they did: for finding him asleep, one tooke him fast by the heeles, the other by the haire, wringing his head behind him, and the third thrust him through with his sword, shee all this while giving them light to dispatch their businesse. The citizens of Pheres when they had drawne his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasse about their streets, and trampled upon it their bellies full, threw it to the dogges to be devoured; so odious was his very remembrance among them.</p>

Whereupon being growne yet more presumptuous, hee made excursions and ryots upon <hi>Adherbals</hi> territories, and did him thereby much injury: and from thence falling to open warre, put him to flight, and pursued him to a city, where hee besieged him so long, till he was constrained to yeeld himselfe. And then having gotten him within his power, put him to the cruellest death he could devise: which villanous deed gave just cause to the Romanes, of that warre which they undertooke against him, wherein hee was discomfited: and seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe utterly lost, fled to his sonne in law <hi>Bochus,</hi> King of Mauritania, to seeke supply of succour, who receiving him into safegard, proved a false gard to him, and delivered him into the hands of his enemies, and so was he carried in triumph to Rome by <hi>Marius</hi> fast bound; and being come to Rome, cast into perpetuall prison, where first his gowne was torne off his backe by violence, next a ring of gold pluckt off his eare, lap and all; and lastly, himselfe starke naked throwne into a deepe ditch, where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating

After the first over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, where one of his sisters was taken prisoner, when he saw himselfe in so desperate a case, that no hope of helpe was left, he slew two other of his sisters, with two of his wives, having before this warre given his foruth sister (who also was his wife) a dram of poyson to make up the tragedy. Afterward being vanquished in the night by <hi>Pompey</hi> the Roman, and put to flight with onely three of his company, as he went about to gather a new supply of forces, behold tydings was brought him of the revolt of many of his Provinces and countries, and of the delivering up of the rest of his daughters into <hi>Pompeyes</hi> hand, and of the treason of his yong sonne <hi>Pharnax,</hi> the gallantest of his sonnes, and whom he purposed to make his successor, who had joyned himselfe to his enemy, which troubled and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished him more than all the rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that his courage being quite dashed, and all hope of bettering his estate extinguished, his other two daughters he poysoned with his owne hands, and sought to practise the same experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon himselfe, but that his body was too strong for the poison, and killed the operation thereof by strength of nature: but that which poyson could not effect, his owne sword performed.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Pompey</hi> the great was never any of the most notorious offenders in Rome, yet did this staine of cruelty, ambition and desire of rule, cleave <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> unto him: for first he joyning himselfe to <hi>Silla,</hi> dealt most cruelly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally with <hi>Carbo,</hi> whom after familiar conference, in shew of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, he caused suddenly to be slain, without shew of mercy. And with <hi>Quintius Valerius,</hi> a wise and well lettered man, with whom walking but two or three turnes, he committed to a cruell and unexpected slaughter. He executed severe punishment upon the enemies of <hi>Sylla,</hi> especially those that were most of note and reputation, and unmercifully put <hi>Brutus</hi> to death, that had rendered himselfe unto his mercy. It was he that devised that new combat of prisoners and wilde beasts, to make the people sport withall; a most inhumane and bloudy pastime, to see humane and manly bodies torne and dismembred by brute and senselesse creatures: which, if we will beleeve <hi>Plutarch,</hi> was the onely cause of his destruction.

But <hi>Caesar</hi> after that he had sustained their greatest brunt, frustrated their purposes, and recovered his forces into his hands, assayled them with such valour and prowesse on all sides, that in short space he overcame this wicked and traiterous nation.

               <p>Although that <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> (concerning whom more occasion of speech <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> will be given hereafter) did tyrannously usurp the key of the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and intruded himselfe into the Empire against the lawes, customes, and authority of the people and Senate, yet was it accounted a most traiterous and cruell part to massacre and kill him in the Senate, as he sat in his seat misdoubting no mishap, as the sequell of their severall ends which were actors in this tragedy did declare: for the vengeance of God was so manifestly displayed upon them, that not one of the conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators escaped, but was pursued by sea and land so eagerly, till there was <note place="margin">Treason, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. &amp; 4. <hi>Plutarch.</hi>
                  </note> nor one left of that wicked crue whom revenge had not overtaken. <hi>Cassius</hi> being discomfited in the battell of Philippos, supposing that <hi>Brutus</hi> had beene also in the same case, used the same sword against himselfe (a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous thing) wherewith before he had smitten <hi>Caesar.

And thus was <hi>Caesars</hi> death revenged by <hi>Octavius</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> who remained conquerors, after all that bloudy crew was brought to nought: betwixt whom also ere long burst out a most cruell division, which grew unto a furious and cruell battell by sea, wherein <hi>Anthony</hi> was overcome, and sent flying into Aegypt, and there taught his owne hands
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59545:87"/>
to be his murtherers. And such was the end of his life, who had beene an actor in that pernicious office of the Triumvirship, and a causer of the deaths of many men. And forasmuch as <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was the first motive and fetter on of <hi>Anthony</hi> to this warre, it was good reason that she should par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take some of that punishment which they both deserved; as she did: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing surprised by her enemies, to the intent she might not be carried in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to Rome, she caused an aspe to bite her to death.

Whereupon all his guard, and others that were there present for his defence, perceiving it to be a judgement of Gods vengeance upon him, abandoned and for sooke him at once: who seeing himselfe desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of succour, and forsaken on all sides, flew into a high tower in Chouz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itze, whither also they pursued him, and climbing even up to the highest roome where hee was, first eat up his wife and children (she being guilty of his uncles death) and lastly gnew and devoured him to the very bones.</p>

But God that had regard and respect unto those poore wretches, tooke their cause into his hand, to quit this proud Prelate with just revenge for his outrage committed against them; sending towards him an army of rats and mice to lay siege against him with the engines of their teeth on all sides, which when this cursed wretch perceived, he removed into a tower that standeth in the midst of Rhine, not far from Bing, whither hee presumed this host of rats could not pursue him; but he was deceived: for they swum over Rhine thick and threefold, and got into his tower with such strange fury, that in very short space they had consumed him to nothing; in memoriall whereof, this tower was ever after called the tower of rats. And this was the tragedy of that bloudy arch-butcher that compared poore Christian soules to brutish and base creatures, and therefore became him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a prey unto them, as <hi>Popiel</hi> King of Poland did before him; in whose strange examples the beames of Gods justice shine forth after an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and wonderfull manner, to the terrour and feare of all men; when by the means of small creatures they made roome for his vengeance, to make entrance upon these execrable creature-murtherers, notwithstanding all mans devises and impediments of nature: for the native operation of the elements was restrained from hindering the passage of them, armed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired with an invincible and supernaturall courage, to feare neither fire, water, nor weapon, till they had finished his command that sent them.

and perverse lives: for as touching the first of them, from the time that he was first installed in the Papacie, he alwayes bent his hornes against the Emperor <hi>Fredericke,</hi> and fought with him with an armie not of men, but of excommunications and cursings; as their manner is: and seeing that all his thundering Buls and Canons could not prevaile so farre as he desired, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently sought to bring to passe that by treason which by force he could not: for he so enchanted certain of his household servants with foule bribes and faire words, that when by reason of his short draught, the poyson which <note place="margin">Hieron.

Moreover, he was chiefe sower of that warre betwixt <hi>Henry,</hi> Lantgrave of Thuring, whom hee created King of the Romanes, and <hi>Conrade, Frederickes</hi> sonne, wherein he reaped a crop of discomfitures and overthrowes: after which, he was found slaine in his bed, his body being full of blacke markes, as if he had beene beaten to death with cudgels.</p>

As therefore he affected and gaped after the rule, so hee thought no meanes dishonest to attaine unto it, and therefore his first enterprise was to take out of the way the Kings brother, who stood betwixt him and home. Having therefore provided fit champions for his purpose, he found oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity one night to cause him to come out of his lodging late by counterfeit tokens from the king, as if he had sent for him about some matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: and being in the way to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> hostle, where the kings lodging was in Paris, the poore Prince suspecting nothing, was suddenly set upon with eighteen roisters at once, with such fury and violence, that in very short space they left him dead upon the pavement, by the gate Barbet, his braines lying scattered about the street. After this detestable and odious act committed and detected, the cruell Burgundian was so farre from sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that he vanted and boasted at it, as if he had atchieved the most valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and honourable exploit in the World (so farre did his impudencie outstretch the bond of reason.) Neverthelesse, to cast some counterfeit co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour upon this rough practise, he used the conscience and fidelitie of three famous Divines of Paris, who openly in publike assemblies approved of this murder; saying, That he had greatly offended, if he had left it undone. About this device he imployed especially M. <hi>Iohn Petit,</hi> a Sorbonist Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, whose rashnesse and brasen-facednesse was so great, as in the councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of the King, stoutly to averre, That that which was done in the death of the Duke of Orleance was a vertuous and commendable action, and the author of it to be void of fault, and therefore ought to be void of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The preface which this brave Orator used, was, That he was bounden in duetie to the Duke of Burgundie, in regard of a goodly pension which he had received at his hands, and for that cause he had prepared his poor tongue in token of gratitude to defend his cause. He might better have said thus, That seeing his tongue was poore and miserable, and he himselfe a sencelesse creature, therefore he ought not to allow or defend so obstinately such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable &amp; traiterous murder committed upon a Duke of Orleance, and the same the Kings brother, in such vile sort; and that if he should doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, he should approve of that which God and man apparently condemned, yea the very Turkes and greatest Paynims under heaven; and that he should justifie the wicked, and condemne the innocent, which is an abomination before God; and should put darkenesse in stead of light, and call that which is evill, good: (for which the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> in his fifth chapter denounceth the jugdements of God against false prophets) and should follow the steps of <hi>Balaam,</hi> which let out his tongue to hire for the wages of iniquity: but none of these supposes came once into his minde. But to returne to our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story: The Duke of Burgundy having the tongues of these brave Doctors at his commandement, and the Parisians who bore themselves partially in this quarrell (generally favourers of his side) came to Paris in armes, to justifie himselfe, as he pretended, and strucke such a dreadfull awe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59545:90"/>
into all mens mindes, that notwithstanding all the earnest pursuit of the Dutchesse, the widow of Orleance, for justice, he escaped unpunished, untill God (by other meanes) tooke vengeance upon him: which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after a while, after that those his complices of Paris (being become lords and rulers of the citie) had committed many horrible and cruell mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as of the Constable and Chancellor, two head officers of the realme, whose bodies fast bound together, they drew naked through the streets from place to place in most despightfull manner: for the Daulphin escaping their hands by night, and safegard in his castle, after that he heard of the seisure of the citie; found meanes to assemble certuine forces, and marched to Montereaufautyon with 20000 men, of purpose to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the Duke for all his brave and riotous demeanors: hither, under colour of parling and devising new means to pacifie these old civill troubles, he enticed the Duke, and being come, at his very first arrivall, as he was bowing his knee in reverence to him, he caused him to be slaine. And on this manner was the Duke of Orleance death quitted, and the evill and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty shewed towards him, returned upon the murderers owne necke; for as he slew him trecherously and cowardly, so was he also trecherously and cowardly slaine, and justly requited with the same measure that he before <note place="margin">Treason, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> had measured to another: notwithstanding herein the Daulphin was not free from a grievous crime of disloyaltie and truth-breach, in working his death without shame of either faith-breach or perjury, and that in his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, whom hee had so often with protestation of assurance and safetie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested to come to him. Neither did he escape unpunished for it; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his fathers decease he was in danger of losing the Crowne, and all for this cause: for <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of Burgundie taking his fathers revenge into his hands, by his cunning devices wrought meanes to displace him from the succession of the kingdome, by according a marriage betwixt the King of England and his sister, to whom he in favor agreed to give his kingdome in reversion after his owne decease. Now assoone as the King of England was seised upon the governement of France, the Daulphin was presently summoned to the marble Table, to give answere for the death of the old Duke: whither, when he made none appearance, they presently banished him the realme, and pronounced him to be unworthy to be succeeder to the noble Crowne: which truely was a very grievous chastisement, and such an one as brought with it a heape of many mischiefes and discomfitures, which happened in the warre betwixt England and him, for the recovery of his kingdome.</p>

Now observe Gods just revenge: <hi>Charles</hi> himselfe had the thred of his life cut off by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat hand of God, by a long and lingring sickenesse, and that before he was come to the full age of 24 yeres: in his sicknesse bloud issued in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance out of many places of his body, insomuch that sometimes he fell and wallowed in his owne bloud: that as he had delight to shed the bloud of so many innocents, so he might now at the latter end of his dayes be glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with bloud. And surely by this meanes the Lord did put him in minde of his former bloudy murders, to draw him to repentance, if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. The Duke of Anjou, who succeeded this <hi>Charles</hi> in the Crowne of France, and was called <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, was murdered by a young Iacobine Monke, called Frier <hi>Iaques Clement,</hi> at the instigation of the duke de Maine and others of the league, and that (wherein appeareth manifestly the hand of God) in the selfe same chamber at S. Cloves wherein the Councell for the great massacre had beene taken and plotted, as it is constantly affirmed. The Duke of Guise, in the yeare 1588, the 23 of December, was murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the kings owne appointment, being sent for into the kings chamber out of the councell chamber, where attended him 45 with rapiers and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards ready prepared to receive him. The Queene mother soone after the slaughter of the Duke of Guise, tooke the matter so to heart, that shee went to bed, and dyed the first of Ianuarie after. Touching all the rest that were chiefe actors in the tragidie, few or none escaped the apparant venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God: and as for Paris and the whole realme of France, they also felt the severe scourge of Gods justice, partly by civile wars and bloudshed, and partly by famine and other plagues; so that the Lord hath plainly made knowne to the world, how precious in the sight of his most Holy Majestie, is the death of innocents, and how impossible it is for cruell murderers to escape unpunished.</p>

Wherefore the Senate of Rome seeing his indignity, proclaimed him an enemy to their commonwealth. and made it lawfull for any man to procure his death: Which being knowne, his souldiers lying at the siege of Aquileia, moved with hatred, entred his tent at noone day, and flew him and his sonne together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iustinian</hi> the yonger (no lesse hatefull to his subjects for his cruelty than <hi>Maximinus)</hi> was deposed from the empire by conspiracy, and having his nosthrils slit, exiled to Chersona, <hi>Leontius</hi> succeeding in his place. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ere long he recovered his Crowne and Scepter, and returned to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, exercising more cruelty at his returne, than ever he had done before: for he had not only put to death <hi>Leontius</hi> and <hi>Tiberius,</hi> but also all that any way favored their parts. It is said of him, that he never blew his mangled nose, but he caused one of them to be executed to death. At last he was slaine by <hi>Philippicus,</hi> to verifie the word of the Lord, That he which striketh with the sword shall perish with the sword.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albonius</hi> king of Lunbardy, drinking upon a time to his wife <hi>Rosimund</hi> in a cup made of her fathers skull (whom he in battell had slaine) so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased her therewith, that (attributing more to naturall affection than unity of marriage) decreed with her selfe to hazard life and kingdome, to be revenged upon this grievous injurie; wherefore she thus practised: A knight called <hi>Hemichild</hi> was enamoured with one of her maids; him shee brought into a secret darke place by policie, in shew to injoy his love, but indeed to be at her command; for she supplyed his loves place: and then discovering her selfe, put it to his choise, either to kill her husband, or to be accused by her of this villanie. <hi>Hemichild</hi> chose the former, and indeed murdered his Lord in his bed; and after the deed done, fled with her to Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna. But marke how the Lord required this murder, even most strangely; for they both which were linkt together in the fact, were linkt together also in the punishment; and as they had beene joynt instruments of anothers destruction, so he made them mutuall instruments of their owne for <hi>Rosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> thinking to poyson him too, made him drinke halfe her medicine: but hee feeling the poyson in his veines, staied in the mid way, and made her sup up the other halfe for her part: so they died both together.</p>
               <p>The Electors of the Empire disagreeing in suffrages, <hi>Adolphus</hi> Duke <note place="margin">Munst. Cosm. Phi. Melan. lib.</note>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:59545:92"/>
of Nassavia, and <hi>Albertus</hi> Duke of Austria, tooke upon them the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and managing of the State: whereupon grew grievous wars in all Germanie, and dissention between the two State-men, so that <hi>Adolphus</hi> was slaine by the Duke of Austria in battell by the citie of Spire: whose death was thus notably revenged. All that tooke part against him, or that were accessary to the murder, perished most strangely; <hi>Albert</hi> Earle of Hagerloch was slaine, <hi>Otto</hi> of Ochsensteme was hanged, the Bishop of Mentz died suddenly of an apoplexie, in his cellar, the Bishop of Strasbrough was butchered by a Butcher: the Earle of Leimingen died of a frensie, the Duke of Austria himselfe was slaine by his nephew <hi>Iohn,</hi> from whom hee had taken the government of Suevia, because of his unthriftinesse: generally they all came to destruction, so grievous is the crie of innocent bloud, against those that are guilty thereof.</p>
               <p>After the death of <hi>Woldimirus</hi> King of Rhythenia, his sonne <hi>Berisus</hi> succeeded in the kingdome, who though hee was a vertuous and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <note place="margin">Treason, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> Prince, yet could not his vertue or religion priviledge him from the malice of his brother <hi>Suadopolcus,</hi> who gaping and itching for the Crowne, slew his brother this good Prince as hee was sleeping in his Chamber, together with his Esquire that attended upon him: and <note place="margin">

Whereupon the last brother <hi>Iorislaus</hi> (to bee revenged on this villanie) set upon him with an armie of men, and killing his complices, drove him to fly to <hi>Crachus</hi> king of Polonia for succour: who furnishing him with a new armie, sent him backe against his brother, in which battell (his successe being equall to the former) hee lost his men, and himselfe escaping the sword, dyed in his flight to Polonia, and was buried in a base and ignoble sepulchre, fit enough for so base and ignoble a wretch. And that we may see how hatefull and ungodly a thing it is to be either a protector or a saver of any murderer, marke the judgement of God that fell upon this king of Polonia, though not in his own person, yet in his posterity; for hee being dead, his eldest sonne and heire <hi>Crachus</hi>

And thus we see that <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> his kingdome came to desolation for maintaining a murderer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> the high Priest of Jerusalem, sonne and successor to <hi>Iudas,</hi> had a brother termed <hi>Iesus,</hi> to whom <hi>Bagoses</hi> the lieutenant of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> army promised the Priesthood, meaning indeed to depose <hi>Iohn,</hi> and install him in his roome: upon which occasion this <hi>Iesus</hi> growing insolent, spared not <note place="margin">

For this cause <hi>Bagoses</hi> imposed a tribute upon them, even a most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous tribute, that for every lambe they offered upon the altar, they should pay fiftie groats to the king of Persia, besides the prophanation of

their temple with the uncircumcised Persians, who entred into it at their pleasures, and so polluted the Sanctuary and holy things of God: this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment continued upon them seven yeares and all for this one murder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gerhardus</hi> Earle of Holsatia, after he had conquered the Danes in many and sundry battells, was traiterously slaine in the citie Kanderhusen, by one <note place="margin">Treason, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note>

               <p>Above all, the execution of Gods vengeance is most notably manifested in the punishment and detection of one <hi>Parthenius</hi> an homicide, treasurer <note place="margin">

For hee delighteth in mens blouds and their destruction, as in nothing more.</p>
               <p>A gentleman of Chaleur in Fossignie, being in the Duke of Savoyes army, in September the yeare of our Lord 1589, and grieving to behold the cruelties which were exercised upon the poore inhabitants of that countrey, resolved to depart from the said army: now because there was no safer nor neerer waie for him, than to crosse the lake to Bonne, he entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one of his acquaintance, named <hi>Iohn Villaine,</hi> to procure him meanes of safe passage over the lake: who for that purpose procured two watermen to transport him, with his horse, apparell, and other things: being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the lake, the watermen, whereof the chiefest was called <hi>Martin Bourrie,</hi> fell upon him and cut his throat: <hi>Iohn Villaine</hi> understanding hereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the magistrates; but they being forestalled with a present from the murderer, of the gentlemans horse, which was of great value, made no inquisition into the matter, but said, that hee was an enemy which was dispatched: and so the murderers were justified; but God would not leave it so unpunished: for about the fifteenth of Iuly 1591, this <hi>Bourrie</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with divers others to shoot for a wager, as hee was charging the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuse which hee had robbed the gentleman of when hee murdered him, it suddenly discharged of it selfe, and shot the murderer through the heart, so that hee fell downe starke dead, and never stirred nor spake word.</p>
               <p>In the first troubles of France, a gentleman of the troups which besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Moulins in Bourbonnois, was taken with sickenesse, in such sort that <note place="margin">Historie of France, Charles the ninth.</note> hee could not follow his company when they dislodged; and lying at a Bakers house which professed much friendship and kindnesse to him, hee put such confidence in him, that hee shewed him all the money that he had: but so farre was this wretch from either conscience or common ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, that assoone as it was night hee most wickedly murdered him. Now marke how God revenged it: it happened not long after, that the murderer being in sentinell, one of his owne fellowes unawares shot him through the arme with a harquebuse, whereof he languished the space of three moneths, and then died starke mad.</p>
               <p>The town of Bourges being yeelded by Monsieur <hi>D'yvoy,</hi> during the first troubles in France, the inhabitants were inhibited from talking together, <note place="margin">The same hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie.</note> either within or without the towne, or from being above two together at a time: under colour of which decree many were most cruelly murdered: And a principall actor herein was one <hi>Garget</hi> captaine of the Bourbonne quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who made a common practise of killing innocent men, under that pretence. But shortly after, the Lord that heareth the crie of innocent bloud met with him for hee was stricken with a burning fever, and ranne up and downe blaspheming the Name of God, calling upon the Divell, and crying out if any would goe along with him to hell, hee would pay his charges; and so died in desperate and franticke manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter Martin,</hi> one of the Queries of the King of France his stable, and Post-master at a place called Lynge, in the way towards Poyctou, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">The same hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie.</note> a sleight accusation, without all just forme of lawfull processe, was condemned by a Lord to bee drowned: The Lord commanded one of his Faulkners to execute this sentence upon him, upon paine to bee drowned himselfe: whereupon he performed his masters command: But God defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not the revenge thereof long; for within three daies after, this Faulkner and a Lackey falling out about the dead mans apparell, went into the field
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59545:93"/>
and slew one another. Thus he that was but the instrument of that murder was justly punished: how much more is it likely that the author escaped not scot free, except the Lord gave him a heart truely to repent?</p>
               <p>It hath beene observed in the history of France, since the yeare of our Lord 1560, that of a thousand murders which remained unpunished in regard of men, not tenne of them escaped the hands of God, but came to most wretched ends.</p>
               <p>In the yeare of our Lord 1546 <hi>Iohn Diazius,</hi> a Spaniard by birth, living a student and Professor in Paris, came first to Geneva, and then to Stras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough, and there by the grace of Gods spirit saw his Sorbonicall errors, and renounced them, betaking himselfe to the profession of the purer reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the company and acquaintance of godly men: amongst whom was <hi>Bucer</hi> that excellent man, who sent him also to Nurnburge, to oversee the printing of a booke which he was to publish. Whilest <hi>Diazius</hi> lived at this Nurnburge (a city scituat upon the river Dimow) his brother, a lawyer, and judge laterall to the Inquisition, by name <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> came thither, and <note place="margin">

But the good man persisted in the truth not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all his perswasions and threats: wherefore the subtill fox took another course, and faining himselfe to be converted also to his religion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted him to goe with him into Italy, where he might do much good; or at the least to Angust: but by the counsell of <hi>Bucer</hi> and his friends he was kept back, otherwise willing to follow his brother. Wherefore <hi>Alphonsus</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and exhorted him to constancy and perseverance, giving him also four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene crowns to defray his charges. Now the wolfe had not been three dayes absent, when he hired a rakehell and common butcher, and with him flew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to Nurnburge in post hast: and comming to his brothers lodging, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him a letter, which whilest he read, the villain his confederat cleft his head in pieces with an axe, leaving him dead upon the floore, and so fled with all expedition. Howbeit they were apprehended, yet quit by the Popes justice (so holy and sacred are the fruits of his Holinesse) though not by the justice of God, for within a while after hee hung himselfe upon his mules necke at Trent.</p>
               <p>Duke <hi>Abrogastes</hi> slew <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour of the West, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced <hi>Eugenius</hi> to the crowne of the Empire: but a while after, the same sword which had slain his lord and master was by his owne hands turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his owne bowels.</p>

               <p>In the yeare of our Lord God 745 one <hi>Sigebert</hi> was authorised king of the Saxons in Britaine, a cruell and tyrannous Prince towards his subjects. and one that changed the ancient Lawes and customes of his Realme after his owne pleasure: and because a certaine Nobleman somewhat sharpely advertised him of his evill conditions, hee maliciously caused him to bee put to death. But see how the Lord revenged this murder, hee caused his
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59545:94"/>
Nobles to deprive him of his kingly authority, and at last as a desolate and forlorne person, wandring alone in a wood, to be slaine of a swine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, whose master he (being king) had wrongfully put to death.</p>
               <p>About the yeare of our Lord 793 <hi>Ethelbert</hi> king of the East Angles, a learned and right godly Prince, came to the court of <hi>Offa</hi> the king of <note place="margin">Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents.</note> Mercia, perswaded by the counsell of his nobles, to sue for the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his daughter, well accompanied like a prince with a great traine of men about him: whereupon <hi>Offa's</hi> Queene conceiving a false suspition of that which was never minded, That <hi>Ethelbert</hi> under the pretence of this marriage, was come to worke some violence against her husband, and the kingdome of Mercia, so perswaded with king <hi>Offa</hi> and certaine of his Councell that night, that the next day following <hi>Offa</hi> caused him to be trained into his palace alone from his company, by one called <hi>Guymber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> who tooke him and bound him, and after strooke off his head, which forthwith he presented to the king and Queene. Thus was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent King wrongfully murdered, but not without a just revenge on Gods hand: for the aforesaid Queene, worker of this villany, lived not three moneths after, and in her death was so tormented, that she bit and rent her tongue in pieces with her teeth, which was the instrument to set abroach that murtherous practise. <hi>Offa</hi> himselfe understanding at length the innocency of the king, and the hainous cruelty of his fact, gave the tenth part of his goods to the Church, bestowed upon the Church of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, in remembrance of this <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> great lands, builded the Abbey of S. Albons, with certaine other Monasteries beside, and afterward went to Rome for his penance, where hee gave to the Church of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> a peny through every house in his dominion, which was commonly called Rome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot, or Peterpence, and there at length was transformed from a king to a monke. Thus God punished not only him and his wife, but the whole land, for this vile murder.</p>
               <p>One principall cause of the conquest of this land by the Normans, was <note place="margin">Ranulphus.</note> a vile and horrible murder committed by one <hi>Goodwin,</hi> an Earle in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, upon certaine Mormans that came overwith <hi>Alfred</hi> and <hi>Edward,</hi> to visit their mother <hi>Emma,</hi> that had beene married to King <hi>Canutus.</hi> This matter thus fell out: When these two came from Normandy to England, to visit their mother, as I have said, Earle <hi>Goodwin</hi> having a daughter called <hi>Godith,</hi> whom hee thought to marry to <hi>Edward,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him to the kingdome, to bring his purpose to passe used this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, that is, to perswade King <hi>Hardeknout</hi> and the Lords, not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer those Normans to bee within the Realme, for jeopardy, but rather to punish them for example: by which meanes hee got authority to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the matter himselfe: Wherefore hee met them on Guild downe, and there wretchedly murdered, or rather martyred the most part of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, killing nine, and leaving the tenth alive throughout the whole company; and then tything againe the said tyth, he slew every tenth knight, and that by cruell torment, as winding their guts out of their body, after a most savage manner: among the rest he put out the eyes of the elder of the two brethren, <hi>Alfred,</hi> and sent him to an Abbey at Elie; where being fed with bread and water, hee ere long ended his life. Now albeit hee obtained his purpose hereby; and married his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Edward,</hi> who was after King, called <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59545:94"/>
yet did not Gods justice sleepe to punish this horrible murder: for he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe died not long after suddenly, having forsworne himselfe, and the Normanes with <hi>William</hi> their Duke ere long came into this Iland, to revenge this murder, as also to claime a right of inheritance bequeathed unto him by <hi>Edward</hi> his Nephew: and how hee succeeded, and what mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he brought this whole Nation unto, who knoweth not. But heere is the justice of God: As the Normans comming with a naturall English Prince, were most cruelly and barbarously murdered of Englishmen; so afterwards the Englishmen were slaine and conquered, by the Normans comming with a forreine King, being none of their naturall countrey.</p>
               <p>In the yeare of our Lord sixe hundred threescore and eighteene, <hi>Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich</hi> King of France caused a Nobleman of his Realme, called <hi>Bolyde,</hi> to bee bound to a stake, and there beaten to death, without the pretence of any just crime or accusation against him: For which cruelty his Lords and Commons, being grievously offended, conspired together, and slew him and his wife as they were hunting.</p>
               <p>In the raigne of <hi>Edward</hi> the second and <hi>Edward</hi> the third, Sir <hi>Roger Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer</hi> committed many villanous outrages, in shedding much humane bloud: but he was also justly recompenced in the end; first he murdered King <hi>Edward</hi> the second, lying in Barkeley Castle, to the end he might, as it was supposed, enjoy <hi>Isabel</hi> his wife, with whom he had very suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious familiarity. Secondly, he caused <hi>Edward</hi> the third to conclude a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonorable peace with the Scots, by restoring them all their ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, charters, and patents, whereby the Kings of Scotland had bound themselves to be feudaries to the Kings of England. Thirdly, he accused <hi>Edmund</hi> Earle of Kent, uncle to King <hi>Edward,</hi> of treason, and caused him unjustly to bee put to death. And lastly he conspi redagainst the King to worke his destruction; for which and divers other things that were laid to his charge he was worthily and justly beheaded.</p>
               <p>In the reigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt, <hi>Humfrey</hi> the good duke of Gloucester, and faithfull protectour of the King, by the meanes of certaine malicious persons, to wit, the Queene, the Cardinall of Winchester, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Marquesse of Suffolke, (as it was supposed) was arrested, cast into hold, and strangled to death in the Abbey of Bure: For which cause the Lords hand of judgement was upon them all: for the Marquesse was not onely banished the land for the space of five yeares, but also banished out of his life for ever; for as hee sailed towards France, hee was met withall by a Ship of Warre, and there presently beheaded, and the dead corps cast up at Dover; that England wherein he had committed the crime, might be a witnesse of his punishment. The Queene, that thought by this meanes to preserve her husband in honour, and her selfe in estate, thereby both lost her husband and her state: her husband lost his realme; and the Realme lost Anjou, Normandy, with all other places beyond the sea, Calice onely excepted. As for the Cardinall, who was the principall artificer of all this mischiefe, he lived not long after; and being on his death bed, murmured and grudged against God, asking wherefore hee should die, having so much wealth and riches? and saying, That if the whole Realme would save his life, he was able either by policy to get it, or by riches to buy it: but death would not be bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; for all his aboundant treasure he died miserably, more like a Heathen
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59545:95"/>
than a Christian, without any shew of repentence. And thus was the good Dukes death revenged upon the princiall procurers thereof.</p>
               <p>As the murder of a gentleman in Kent, called master <hi>Arden</hi> of Fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham, was most execrable, so the wonderfull discovery thereof was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rare. This <hi>Arden</hi> being somewhat aged, had to wife a young woman, no lesse faire than dishonest, who being in love with one <hi>Mosbie</hi> more than her husband, did not onely abuse his bed, but also conspired his death with this her companion: for together they hired a notorious Ruffin, one <hi>Blacke Will,</hi> to strangle him to death with a towell as he was playing a game at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: which though secretly done, yet by her owne guilty conscience, and some tokens of bloud which appeared in his house, was soone discovered and confessed. Wherefore she her selfe was burnt at Canterbury: <hi>Michael,</hi> master <hi>Ardens</hi> man, was hanged in chaines at Feversham: <hi>Mosbie</hi> and his sister were hanged in Smithfield: <hi>Greene</hi> another partner in this bloudy action was hanged in chaines in the high way against Feversham: And <hi>Blacke Will</hi> the Ruffian, after his first escape, was apprehended and burnt on a seaffold at Flushing in Zeeland. And thus all the murderers had their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served dues in this life, and what they endured in the life to come (except they obtained mercy by true repentance) is easie to judge.</p>

               <p>And to begin with our owne countrey: About the yeare of our Lord <note place="margin">Ex historia Iornlens.</note> 867, a certaine Nobleman of the Danes, of the kings stock, called <hi>Lothebro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> father to <hi>Inguar</hi> and <hi>Hubba,</hi> entring upon a certaine time with his hawke into a cockboat alone, by chance through tempest was driven with his hawke to the coast of Northfolke in England, named Rodham: where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found, and detained, he was presented to king <hi>Edmund,</hi> that raigned over the East-Angles in Northfolke and Suffolke at that time. The King (as hee
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59545:95"/>
was a just and good man) understanding his parentage, and seeing his cause, entertained him in his Court accordingly; and every day more and more perceiving his activity, and great dexterity in hunting and hawking, bare speciall favour unto him: insomuch that the Kings Faulconer bearing pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy malice against him, for this cause, secretly as they were hunting together in a wood, did murther him, and threw him in a bush. <hi>Lothebroke</hi> being thus murthered, and shortly missed in the Kings house, no tydings could be heard of him, untill it pleased God to reveale the murther by his dog: which continuing in the wood with the corps of his Master, at sundry times came to the Court, and fauned on the King: so that the King suspecting some such matter, at length followed the trace of the hound, and was brought to the place where <hi>Lothebroke</hi> lay. Whereupon inquisition being made, at length by some circumstances of words, and other suspitions, it was knowne that he was murdered by <hi>Berik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> the Kings Faulconer: who for his punishment he was set into the same boat of <hi>Lothebroke</hi> alone, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the mercy of the sea: but the sea more mercifull to him than he was to <hi>Lothebroke,</hi> carried him directly to the coast of Denmarke, from whence <hi>Lothebroke</hi> came; as it were there to be punished for his murder. Here the boat of <hi>Lothebroke</hi> being well knowne, hands were lay upon him, and by torments he was enquired into: but hee to save himselfe, uttered an untruth of King <hi>Edmund;</hi> saying, That the King had put him to death in Northfolke. Whereupon revenge was devised, and to that end an army of men prepared and sent over: which was the first occasion of the Danes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall in this land. Thus was this murther wonderfully discovered by meanes of a dog.</p>

Whereupon being apprehended and examined, they soone confessed the fact, and received condigne punishment for their desert. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ascribeth this to the secret of Natures instinct: but we must rather attribute both this and all such like, to the mighty fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God. who to terrifie men from shedding humane bloud, doth stirre up the dumbe creatures to be revealers of their bloudy sinne.</p>
               <p>The like story the same Author reporteth of the murder of the Poet <hi>Hesiod,</hi> who being slaine by the sonnes of <hi>Ganyctor,</hi> the murder, though se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, <note place="margin">The same.</note> and the Murderers, though unknowne to all the world save to God and their owne conscience, were discovered and brought to punishment by the means of a dog which belonged to him that was murdered.</p>
               <p>The like also we reade of two French Merchants, which travailing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through a certaine Wood, one of them rose against the other for the <note place="margin">Blondus.</note> desire of his mony, and so slew him, and buried him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Dog of the murdered Merchant would not depart from the place, but filled the Woods with howlings and cryes. The murderer went forward on his journey, and the Inhabitants neere the said Wood, found out the murdered corps, and also the Dog, whom they tooke up and nourished till the Faire was done,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59545:96"/>
and the Merchants returned; at which time they watched the Highwayes, having the Dog with them: who seeing the murtherer, instantly made force at him without all provocation, as a man would doe at his mortall enemy: which thing caused the people to apprehend him; who being exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, confessed the fact, and received condigne punishment for so foule a deed.</p>
               <p>The same Author reporteth yet a more memorable and strange story of <note place="margin">Blondus.</note> another murder discovered also by the meanes of a dogge, which I may not omit. There was (saith hee) a certaine maid neere Paris, who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of two young men; the one of whom as he was going to visite his love, happened to be murdered by the way, and buried: now his dog which he had with him would not depart from the grave of his master: at the last the young man being missed by his father and brethren, was diligently sought for; but not finding him, at last they found his dog lying upon his grave, that howled pittifully as soone as he saw his masters brother: the grave was opened, and the wounded corps found, which was brought away, and committed to other buriall, untill the murderer should be descryed: Afterward, in processe of time, the dogge in the presence of the dead mans brethren espied the murderer, and presently assaulted him with great fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: Whereupon he was appreliended, and examined, and when by no meanes nor policy he would confesse, the magistrate adjudged, That the young man and the dogge should combate together: The dogge was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a dry sod skinne in stead of armour, and the murderer with a speare, and on his body a thinne linnen cloth; and so they both came forth to fight: but behold the hand of vengeance: the man offering at the dogge with his speare, the dogge leaped presently at his face, and caught him fast by the throat, and overthrew him: whereat the wretch amased, cryed out to the beholders, Take pity on me, and pull off the dogge from my throat, and I will confesse all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the which being done, he declared the cause and manner of the whole murder, and for the same was deservedly put to death.</p>
               <p>All these murders were discovered by dogges, the Lord using them as instruments to reveale his justice and vengeance upon this bloudy sinne, but these following by other meanes: The murder of the Poet <hi>Ibycus</hi> was detected by Cranes; as you may see in the 36 chapter of this booke more at large set forth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> recites such another story as that of <hi>Ibycus,</hi> of a certain Almaigne, <note place="margin">Luther.</note> who in travelling fell among theeves, which being about to cut his throat, the poore man espied a flight of Crows, and said, <hi>O Crows I take you for wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and revengers of my death.</hi> About two or three daies after, these mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering theeves drinking in an Inne, a company of Crows came and lighted on the top of the house: whereupon the theeves began to laugh and say one to another, Looke yonder are they which must revenge his death, whom we dispatched the other day. The Tapster over-hearing them, told it to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat; who presently caused them to be apprehended, and upon their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing in speeches and contrary answers, urged them so far, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the truth, and received their deserved punishment.</p>
               <p>There was one <hi>Bessus</hi> (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth) who having killed his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was brought both to knowledge and punishment by the meanes of <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> Swallowes: for his guilty conscience persuaded him, that the Swallowes in their chattering language did say to one another, That <hi>Bessus</hi> had killed his
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59545:96"/>
father: whereupon not able to conceale his owne guiltinesse, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed his horrible fact: and was worthily and deservedly for the same put to death.</p>
               <p>But of all the examples that either reading or experience can afford, none in my opinion is either more admirable, or a more clearer testimony of Gods providence &amp; justice, than that which hapned about a Lucquois Merchant, <note place="margin">

Now as this fact was a doing, a blind man ran by, being led by his dog; who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one groane, asked who it was? Whereunto the murderer answered, that it was a sicke man going to ease himselfe. The blind man thus deluded, went his way, and the servant with his masters money, and with Papers of his takes up at Paris a good summe of money, and sets up a shop at Roane. Now this Merchant being expected at Luca a whole yeare together, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had sent word he would shortly repaire; when he came not, a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger was dispatched to seeke him out; and after much enquiry at London and Roan, and elsewhere, he learnt at last in an Inne, that a Lucquois Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant about sixe moneths before had lodged there, and was gone to Paris: where also not hearing any tydings of him, he suspected that he was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, &amp; made his complaint to the Court of Parliament at Roan: Which imbracing this businesse (being directed by Gods providence) made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry up and downe the Towne, Whether there were any that within seven or eight moneths had set up a new shop; and finding one, caused him to be arrested for a supposed and a pretended debt: but in the end examined him upon this murther, and laid it to his charge: herewith the prisoner, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited partly bythe remorse of his conscience, &amp; partly by hope of freeing himselfe by a bribe, confessed the fact in private to the Justice but as soone as he perceived that he went about to call in witnesses to his confession, hee denyed it againe: in briefe, the new Merchant is committed to prison, and he sueth the Justice for forgerie and false imprisonment: the Justice can by no meanes cleare himselfe, but onely by the assurance that all men had of his honesty. The matter hangs thus in suspence, till at length the dead carkasse of the Lucquois was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This course being ofttimes re-iterated, the blind man hit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes on the right, and never missed. Whereupon the Court condemned him to death, and before he dyed he confessed the fact, to the great glory of Gods Justice, and the great amazement and strange astonishment of all men.</p>
               <p>At Paris, in the yeare of our Lord 1551, a certaine young woman was brained by a man with a hammer, neere unto Saint <hi>Opportunes</hi> Church, <note place="margin">

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59545:97"/>
of the meanes to get his living; whereby being reduced into extreame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, he ended his life in great misery. All this while the murderer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unknowne almost for the space of twenty yeares, and the memory of the murder seemed to be buried with the poore woman in her grave: now marke the justice of God, who hath promised, that nothing shall be so hid but shall be brought to light. It hapned, that one <hi>Iohn Flaming,</hi> Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of the Subsidies at Paris, being upon occasion of businesse at S. Leups, a Village by Montmorency, chanced among other talke at Supper to say, how he had left his wife at home sicke, and no body with her but a little boy: there was an old man then present, named <hi>Monstier,</hi> and a sonne in law of his, who immediatly upon this speech went away that night, with each of them a basket of cherries and a greene goose, and came about ten of the clock the next morning to <hi>Flamings</hi> house, where they intended to murder both the woman and the boy, and to possesse themselves of all the goods that they could conveniently carrie away: but the Lord prevented them of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: for being let in at the dores by the boy, pretending that they came from the husband with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now these two wretches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus apprehended, arraigned, and condemned, being on the seaffold at the place of execution, the old man desired to speake with the Smithes wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, whose husband was suspected for the first murder: of whom when she came, hee asked forgivenesse; saying, that it was he which had killed the young woman by S. <hi>Opportunes</hi> Church. Thus the Lord discovered both the innocency of the Smith, and the guiltinesse of this vile murderer, and that twenty yeeres after the fact was committed.</p>
               <p>Not long since the like discovery of a murderer was made here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in Leicestershire, not farre from Lutterworth, almost twenty yeeres after the fact committed, The murder was committed by a Miller upon one in his Mill, whom he buried in the ground hard by: This Miller removed unto another countrey, and there dwelt a long space, untill at last guided by Gods Almighty providence, to the manifestation of his justice, he returned unto that place to visit some of his friends. Now in the meane time whilest he was there, the Miller that now possessed the former Mill, had occasion to dig deepe into the ground, where he found the carkasse of a dead man, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently it was suspected that some had beene murdered, and was there buried: whereupon the Lord put it into their hearts to remember, how about twenty yeares before a certaine neighbour of theirs was suddenly missed, and could never be heard of, insomuch that all supposed him to have beene dead in some strange countrey: this carkasse they suspected to be his, and bethinking themselves who was then Miller of that Mill, behold he was there ready in the towne, not having been there for many yeares before. This man was suspected, nd thereupon examined, and without much adoe confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the fact, and received deserved punishment.</p>
               <p>Who seeth not here manifest traces and footsteps of Gods providence? First in reducing the murderer to that place at that time: Secondly, in stirring up the Miller to digge at the same time also: thirdly, in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59545:97"/>
putting into the hearts of the people the missing of such a man, whose me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory was almost forgotten: and lastly, in causing the murderer to confesse his deed, when as no proofe nor witnesse could be brought against him: but here is the justice of God against all such, <hi>Vengeance will not suffer the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer</hi>

                  <hi>Henry Ranzovius,</hi> Lieutenant for the King of Denmarke in the Duchie of <note place="margin">Ranzovius.</note> Holsace, makes relation in a letter of his, of an ordinary meanes of finding out Murderers, practised in the kingdome of Denmark by King <hi>Christiernus</hi> the second, and permitted over all his Kingdome; the occasion whereof (he saith) was this: Certaine Gentlemen being on an evening together in a stove, fell out among themselves, and from words grew to blowes (the Candles being put out) insomuch that one of them was stabbed with a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyard. Now the deed doer was unknowne by reason of the number; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Gentleman accused a Pursevant of the Kings for it, who was one of them in the stove. The King to finde out the homicide, caused them all to come together in the stove, and standing round about the dead Corps, becommanded that they should one after another lay their right hand on the slain Gentlemans naked breasts, swearing they had not killed him: the Gentlemen did so, and no signe appeared to witnesse against them; the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sevant onely remained, who condemned before in his owne conscience, went first of all and kissed the dead mans feet, but as soone as he layed his hand on his breast, the blood gushed forth in abundance, both out of his wound and nosthrils, so that urged by this evident accusation, he confessed the murder, and by the Kings owne sentence was incontinently beheaded: whereupon (as I said before) arose that practise which is now ordinary in many places of finding out unknowne Murders; which by the admirable power of God are for the most part revealed, either by the bleeding of the corpes, or the opening of the eye, or some other extraordinary signe, as daily experience doth teach.</p>
               <p>The same Authour reporteth another example farre more strange, in the same letter written to <hi>David Chytreus,</hi> which happened at Itzehow in Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke. A Traveller was murdered by the high-way side, and because the murderer could not be found out, the Magistrates of Itzehow caused the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be taken up, and one of the hands to be cut off, which was carried into the prison of the Towne, and hung up by a string in one of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: about ten yeares after, the murderer comming upon some occasion in to the prison, the hand which had been a long time dry began to drop blood on the Table that stood underneath it: which the Gaoler beholding, stayed the fellow, and advertised the Magistrates of it; who examining him, the <note place="margin">

               <p>At Winsheime in Germany, a certaine Theefe after many Robberies and Murders committed by him upon Travellers and Women with childe, went to the Shambles before Easter, and bought three Calves heads, which when hee put into a Wallet, they seemed to the standers by to be mens heads: whereupon being attached and searched by the Officers, and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined how hee came by them, answered and proved by witnesses, that hee bought Calves heads, and how they were transformed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59545:98"/>
arise of naught, cast the party into prison, and tortured him to make him confesse what villany he had committed; who confessed indeed at last his horrible murders, and was worthily punished for the same, and then the heads recovered their old shapes. When I read this story, I was halfe afraid to set it downe, least I should seeme to insert fables into this serious Treatise of Gods Judgements: but seeing the Lord doth often worke miraculously for the disclosing of this foule sinne, I thought that it would not seeme alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether incredible.</p>
               <p>Another murderer at Tubing betrayed his murder by his owne sighes, which were so deepe and incessant, in griefe not of his fact, but of his small <note place="margin">Lonicer.</note> booty, that being but asked the question, he confessed the crime, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went worthy punishment.</p>
               <p>Another murtherer in Spain was discovered by the trembling of his heart; for when many were suspected of the murder, and all renounced it, the Judge caused all their breasts to be opened, and him in whom he saw most trembling of brest, he condemned, who also could not deny the fact, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently confessed the same.</p>
               <p>At Isenacum a certaine yong man being in love with a maid, and not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wherewith to maintain her, used this unlawfull meanes to accomplish his desire; upon a night he slew his host, and throwing his body into a Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, tooke away all his money, and then hasted away; but the terrour of his owne conscience and the judgement of God so besotted him, that hee could not stirre a foot untill he was apprchended. At the same time <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther,</hi> and <hi>Philip Melancthon</hi> abode at Isenacum, and were eye-witnesses of this miraculous judgement, who also so dealt with this murderer, that in most humble and penitent confession of his sinnes, and comfort of soule, he ended his life.</p>
               <p>By all these examples wee see, how hard it is for a murderer to escape without his reward: when the justice of man is either too blinde, that it cannot search out the truth, or too blunt, that it doth not strike with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the man appointed unto death, then the justice of God riseth up, and with his owne arme he discovereth and punisheth the murderer; yea, rather than he shall goe unpunished, sencelesse creatures and his owne heart and tongue rise to give sentence against him. I doubt not but daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in all places affordeth many more examples to this purpose, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the experience of our Judges in criminall causes, who have continuall occasion of understanding such matters in their Circuits: but these shall suffice for our present purpose.</p>

that spill the bloud of others, much more guilty are they before God that shed their owne bloud: and if nature bindeth us to preserve the life of all men as much as lyeth in our power, then much more are we bound to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve our owne lives, so long as God shall give us leave. We are here set in this life as souldiers in a station, without the licence of our Captaine we must not depart: our soule is maried to the body by the appointment of God, none must presume to put a sunder those whom God hath coupled: and our life is committed to us as a thing in trust, we must not redeliver it, nor part with it, untill he require it againe at our hands that gave it into, our hands. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his first Booke <hi>De Civitate Dei,</hi> doth most <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. de civit. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 26.</note> strongly evince and prove, That for no cause voluntary death is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken: neither to avoid temporall troubles, least we fall into eternall; nor for feare to be polluted with the sinnes of others, lest by avoiding other mens sinnes, we encrease our owne; nor yet for our owne sinnes that are past, for the which we have more need of life that we might repent of them: nor lastly: for the hope of a better life, because they which are guilty of their owne death, a better life is not prepared for them. These be the words of <hi>Augustine:</hi> wherein he alledgeth foure causes, by which men are mooved to this unnaturall act; and concludeth, that for none of them, nor for any other cause what soever, a man ought to lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and bloudy hands upon himselfe; yea, concludeth peremptorily, that a better life after death doth not receive such, to wit, that wilfully and desperately murder themselves, and die without repentance, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they doe. But here it is to be observed, that many which seeme to make away themselves, are murdered and made away by the Divell, and not by themselves: for otherwise it were not possible that then should pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish so strangely as they doe: as when some have beene hanged with their knees almost touching the ground; others upon a weake twigge, not strong enough to beare the weight of the tenth part of their body: others beene drowned in a puddle of water: which plainely sheweth, that the Divell, either as the principall actor, or at least as a helper, was the procurer of their murders, and not alwayes themselves: And therefore I must needs say with <hi>Luther,</hi> That both charity and conscience inhibites resolutely to judge all such to be damned that seeme to have made havocke of their owne lives; for the mercy of God is incomprehensible, and why may he not save the soules of them, whose bodies he gave leave to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell to torment, yea to destroy? Besides, we read of many holy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who in the time of persecution cast themselves into the deep stream to preserve their chastity from the violence of the wicked persecutours; and yet were reputed in the Church for holy Martyrs. Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi> judgement is worthy to be learned and imitated of all concerning this matter, who thus defineth the case: <hi>Of these</hi> (saith he) <hi>I dare avouch nothing rashly: it may be the Church of God was perswaded by divine authority to receive them into the number of Martyrs; or it may be they did this act, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived, after the manner of men, but being commanded of God, not er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but obeying;</hi> as also we are to judge of <hi>Sampson:</hi> now when God biddeth, and without all doubt makes knowne his will, who can call this obedience a crime? who can accuse a duety of piety? But a little after he giveth a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat, <hi>Ne divina iussio ullo nutet incerto;</hi> that is, that we be sure God bids; for often times the divell translates himself into an Angell of light, and wil feine
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59545:99"/>
a message from God, which proceedeth from his owne malice. All this is to be conceived only touching that extraordinary case of those holy women that drowned themselves, and yet were held for Martyrs in the Church of God: as for others that shall wilfully and wofully shed their owne blouds, and rob themselves of that precious jewell of life which God hath given them to keep, no doubt but as they commit a horrible and hainous crime, so they incurre a horrible and fearefull judgement: yea, the very act it selfe is both a crime and a judgment; a crime deserving a further judgment, even eternall damnation in hell fire; and a judgement and punishment of some notable sinnes comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The drift therfore &amp; purpose of these examples follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this, to shew how the Lord punisheth oftentimes in men an ungodly life with voluntary and wilfull murder of themselves, and this wilfull mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of themsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es with eternall damnation after this life ended, as a just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of their deserts; and all to teach us repentance, the onely means to prevent both these.</p>
               <p>The first we reade of in holy Scripture that cruelly murdered himselfe <note place="margin">1 Sam. 31. 4.</note> with his owne hands, was King <hi>Saul;</hi> who, as it is recorded of him, was a most wicked man and a Tyran: for being chosen from among all the people of Israel to be King by the Lords owne appointment, and advanced as it were from the Plough to the Scepter, he like a most ungratefull wretch kicked against his advancer, and rebelled against his God that had done so great things for him: yea, hee not onely contemned his lawes, and cast his commandements behind his backe but also proved a most cruell Tyran, and shed much innocent blood: amongst the rest of his cruelties, this was the chiefe; upon the false accusation of <hi>Doeg</hi> the Edomite, he caused foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score <note place="margin">1 Sam. 22. 18, 19.</note> and five persons, that were Priests, and wore a linnen Ephod, to bee staine at one time, and Nob the Citie of the Priests to be smote with the edge of the sword, both man and woman, childe and suckling, Oxe and Asse: yea, so wicked was he, that when the Lord would not answer him neither by Prophets, nor by dreames, nor by any other meanes, he went to take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of the Divell, at the mouth of the Witch of Endor: for all which his <note place="margin">1 Sam. 28. 15.</note> abominable wickednesse, the Lord gave him over at last to so desperate a minde, that rather than he would fall into the hands of his enemies, he fell upon his owne sword, and murdered himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zimri</hi> also, the King of Israel, is set forth by the holy Ghost to be a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, and a traitor: for he conspited against his master <hi>Ela,</hi> the sonne <note place="margin">1 King. 16. 10, 18, 19.</note> of <hi>Baasha</hi> King of Israel, and flew him as he was drinking in Tirza, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed himselfe King in his roome: but the army hearing thereof, made <hi>Omri,</hi> the Captaine of the hoste, King: who comming to besiege Tirza, wherein <hi>Zimri</hi> was, <hi>Zimri</hi> seeing that the Citie was taken, went into the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the Kings house, and there, together with the house burnt himselfe, rather than he would fall into the hands of his enemy: Now the holy Ghost setteth it downe in plaine words, that the Lord sent this judgement upon him for his sinnes which he had sinned, in doing that which was evill in the of the Lord, and walking in the way of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> who made Israel to sinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Achitophel,</hi> that great Counsellor of State to King <hi>David,</hi> of whom it is <note place="margin">2 Sam. 17, 20.</note> said, that the counsell which he counselled was like the Oracle of God, when hee saw that the counsell which hee gave was not followed, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59545:99"/>
hee sadled his Asse, and arose and went home into his owne citie, and put his houshold in order, and hanged himselfe: And that this was Gods just vengeance upon him for his former wickednesse, it may appeare both by his conspiracie with <hi>Absalom</hi> against his liege lord king <hi>David,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 21, 22.</note> and also that wicked counsel which hee gave unto him, of going in unto his fathers concubines in the sight of the people.</p>
               <p>In the second booke of the Machabees is recorded a notable story of one <note place="margin">2 Mac. 14. 37, 38.</note> 
                  <hi>Raz is</hi> an Elder of Jerusalem, who is there set forth to bee a man of very good report, constant in religion, a father of the Jewes, and a lover of the citie: yet notwithstanding, this man rather than hee would fall into the hands of <hi>Nicanor</hi> his enemy, murdered himselfe after a most fearefull and savage manner, for first hee fell upon his sword, and when as for haste that stroke dispatched him not, hee ran boldly or rather furiously to the wall, and cast himselfe downe headlong; after which yet breathing, hee got up on a steepe rocke, and rending out his bowels with his owne hands, threw them amongst the people, calling upon the Lord of life, that hee would restore them againe unto him. The author of that booke commendeth this fact for a valiant and noble deed; but surely wee are taught out of the booke of God by Gods spirit, that it was a most bloudy, barbarous, and irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious act: for rather should a man endure all the reproaches and torments of an enemy, than embrue his owne hands in his owne bloud; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he were not extraordinarily stirred up hereunto by the spirit of God, this must needs bee a just punishment of some former sinne wherein hee lay without repentance, and a forerunner of an eternall punishment after this life.</p>
               <p>Let us joyne <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> together, the one being the betrayer of his Lord and Master Jesus Christ our Saviour, the other the condemner of him, and that against his conscience: as they both agreed in one malicious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise against the life of Christ, so they disagreed not in offering violence to their owne lives: for <hi>Iudas</hi> hanged himselfe, and his bowels gushed out, and <hi>Pilat</hi> being banished to Vienna, and oppressed with the torment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science <note place="margin">Acts 1. <hi>Euseb.</hi>
                  </note> and feare of punishment for his misdeeds, to prevent all killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and so became a notable spectacle of Gods justice, and Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie.</p>
               <p>The Jewes, as they are recorded in Scripture to bee a stiffe-necked and stubborne Nation, above all the Nations under the Sunne, so none were ever more hardy and daring in this bloudy practise of selfe-murther than they were; which may bee thought a portion of Gods just judgement upon them for their sinnes: three examples of greatest note I will propound, which I thinke can hardly bee matched.</p>
               <p>When the City of Jerusalem was taken by <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Sosius,</hi> there was a certaine Jew that had hidden himselfe in a denne with his wife and seven <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iosephus de bell. Iud. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 12. 13.</note> children; to whom <hi>Herod</hi> offered both life and liberty, if hee would come forth: but the stiffe-hearted wretch had rather die than bee captive to the Romanes: therefore refusing <hi>Herods</hi> offer, hee first threw downe his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren headlong from a high rocke, and burst their neckes, next hee sent his wife after them, and lastly tumbled himselfe upon their carkasses to make up the tragedie: a horrible and lamentable spectacle of a proud and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate minde.</p>
               <p>The second example is nothing inferior to the former. After the siege
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59545:100"/>
and sacking of Jotapata by the Romanes, forty Jewes (among whom was <hi>Iosephus</hi> the writer of this story) having hid themselves in a cave, by mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all consent killed one another, rather than they would fall into the hands of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iosephus Fulgol. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> the Romanes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Iosephus</hi> onely, with one other, by his persuasion, by great art and industry, after the other were slain, proceeded not in that bloudy enterprise, but yeelded themselves to the mercy of the enemies, and so es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped with their lives. This fearefull obstinacy may well be imputed to the justice of God upon them, as for their other sinnes, so especially for cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Lord of life, whose bloud they imprecated might fall on them and on their children.</p>
               <p>The third example surpasseth both the former both in cruelty and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy: <hi>Eleazer</hi> the Jew after the taking of Jerusalem fled into the tower of Messada with nine hundred followers; being besieged there by <hi>Sabinus Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> a Roman Captaine, when he saw that the walls were almost beaten <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fulgos. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> downe, and that there was no hope of escaping, he persuaded his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by a pithy and vehement Oration, and drew them to this resolution, that tenne should be chosen by lot, which should kill all the rest, together with their wives and children, and that afterward they themselves should kill each other. The former part of this Tragedy being performed, the surviving tenne first set on fire the Tower, that no prey might come unto the enemy (the victuals only preserved, to the end it might be knowne, that not hunger, but desperate valour drew them to this bloudy massacre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) then according to their appoyntment, by mutuall wounds they dispatched one another: and of so great a number not one remained, besides one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with her five children, who hearing the horriblenesse of their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, hid her selfe in a cave in the ground, and so escaped with the life of her selfe and her children, and became a reporter of this whole story.</p>
               <p>The like story is recorded by <hi>Livie</hi> touching the Campagnians; who being besieged by the Romanes, and constrained to yeeld up their City unto them upon composition, <hi>Vibius,</hi> a chiefe nobleman of the City, with seven <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Liv. lib.</hi> 26.</note> and twenty other Senatours, that they might not fall into their enemies hands, after they had glutted themselves with wine and good cheere, dranke all of them poyson, and so bewayling the state of their countrey and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing each other, and taking their last farewell, died ere the enemies were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the city.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Buthes,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Boges</hi> by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> Governor of Thracia, being besieged in the city Eion, by <hi>Cymon</hi> the Athenian captaine, to the end that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fulgos. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> the enemy might receive no benefit nor great glory by his victory, first caused the city to be fired, and then by one consent they all killed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. So likewise did <hi>Ariarathes</hi> king of Capadocia, when he was besieged by <hi>Perdicca. Cato Vticensis,</hi> rather than he would fall into the hands of <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Caesar,</hi> his enemy, after his victory over <hi>Pompey,</hi> fell upon his owne sword, and slew himselfe; having first read <hi>Plato's</hi> booke of the immortality of the soule. So likewise did <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> after that he was over come by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus.</hi> And <hi>Cleopatra</hi> the Aegyptian Queene, when as by her allurements she could not intice <hi>Augustus</hi> to her lust, as she had done <hi>Anthony,</hi> but perceived that she was reserved for triumph, escaping out of prison, and placing her selfe in her sumptuous sepulchre, neere to the body of her dead paramour, set an Aspe to her left arme, by the venome whereof she died as it were in a sleepe. Thus the Lord doth infatuate the mindes of wicked and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59545:100"/>
ungodly persons, and such as have no true knowledge nor feare of the true God in their hearts, making them instruments of his vengeance, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of his wrath upon themselves.</p>

                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> the sonne of <hi>Amilchar,</hi> after many victories and much blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed <note place="margin">Fulgos.</note> of the Romans, at last being overcome, and doubting of the faith of <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> the King of Bythinia, to whom he was fled for succour, poysoned himselfe with poyson which he alwayes carried in a Ring to that purpose.</p>
               <p>At the destruction of Carthage, when as <hi>Asdrubal</hi> the chiefe Captaine <note place="margin">Fulgos.</note> submitted himselfe to the mercy of <hi>Scipio,</hi> his wife cursing and railing on him for his base mind, threw her children into the midst of a fire, and there ended her dayes: and <hi>Asdrubal</hi> himselfe not long after followed her by a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and violent death.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Cinna</hi> besieged the city of Rome, two brothers chanced to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Philip. Melan. Chron.</hi> 2.</note> together in single fight, one of <hi>Cinna's</hi> army, the other of the contrary: and the one having slaine the other, after that the Conquerour perceived that it was his brother whom hee had slaine, hee slew himselfe also, to make satisfaction for his brothers blood: and so they were both buried in one grave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Norbanus</hi> a Consull of Rome flying from <hi>Scylla,</hi> slew himselfe at Rhodes, rather than he would fall into his enemies hands: and so did likewise <hi>Marius</hi> the sonne, at Praeneste.</p>
               <p>Of the murderers of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> almost all became also the murderer of themselves: <hi>Cassius</hi> stabb'd himselfe with the same dagger wherewith he had stabb'd <hi>Caesar: Brutus</hi> the night before his overthrow at Philippi, saw in his chamber a vision of a great fearefull man; and he demanding who he was, and what he would, he answered, I am (O <hi>Brutus)</hi> thy evill spirit, and to morrow thou shalt see me at Philippi: To whom <hi>Brutus</hi> with a bold cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage answered, I will therefore see thee there. The next day <hi>Brutus</hi> being conquered by <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi> at Philippi, fell upon his own sword and slew himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Methridates</hi> that bloody and mighty King of Pontus being overcome of <hi>Lucullus</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> and set upon by his owne sonne, went about to make away himselfe by poyson: which when it tooke not effect, by reason of his daily taking of Antidotes, he forced a French souldier of his to lay violent hands upon him; and so hee became a wilfull spiller of his owne blood, that had caused the blood of so many thousands to be spilt. His two wives <hi>Monica</hi> and <hi>Veronica,</hi> hearing of the miserable end of the king, made likewise themselves away; for the one hanged her selfe, but when the weight of her body broke the cord, shee committed her selfe to <hi>Bochis</hi> the Eunuch to bee slaine: the other received poyson, which when it wrought not so speedily as shee desired, <hi>Bochis</hi> also was made an instrument to dispatch her.</p>
               <p>Most famous and notorious is the story of <hi>Lucretia,</hi> who being ravished <note place="margin">Livit.</note> by <hi>Tarquinius</hi> the yonger, and impatient of that injury and disgrace, slew her selfe openly, and gave cause by her death of the change of the Roman State, from the government of Kings to Consuls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophronia</hi> another Roman woman, but a Christian, when as she could by <note place="margin">Euseb.</note> no meanes escape the lust of <hi>Decius</hi> the Emperour, daily assaulting her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, tooke a sword, and by her husbands consent slew her selfe; and so to prevent one sin, she committed another farre worse than that she feared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Portia</hi> the daughter of <hi>Cato,</hi> and wife of <hi>Brutus,</hi> hearing of the death of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59545:101"/>
her husband at Philippi, sought for a knife to kill her selfe; which being denyed her, she eat burning coales, and so ended her life by a strange kinde of death.</p>
               <p>Wee read of many wanton and lewd Poets that have thus made an end of themselves: who as for the most they are Epicures and Atheists, so sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come to a good end: <hi>Labienus</hi> the railing Poet (who for that cause was called <hi>Rabienus)</hi> understanding that his bookes were adjudged to bee burned by a publike Decree, would not survive his own writings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore killed himselfe. <hi>Lucretius</hi> the Atheist taking a love potion to incite his lust, was by the force therof deprived of his sences, and so deprived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe also of life in his rage. <hi>Empedocles</hi> the vainglorious Poet, affecting the name of a god, and of immortality, threw himselfe headlong into mount Aetna, and so perished. <hi>Silvius Italicus</hi> being taken with an incurable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, chose rather to be his owne murderer, than to endure the torment of his sicknesse. <hi>Cornelius Gallus</hi> an amatorius Poet, having robbed the City Thebes, over which he was set to be governour by <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">Ammianus Marcellinus.</note> to be called to account, prevented the punishment of humane justice, by executing the justice of God upon himselfe with his owne hands.</p>
               <p>Of those that persecuted the Church of Christ, very many were given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by God to be persecutors of themselves, and spoylers of their owne lives: as <hi>Nero</hi> for example, the first Emperour that tooke in hand to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute <note place="margin">Suet.</note> Christians, he seeing himselfe in danger to be murdered by one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that purpose, to prevent the malice of the murderer, murdered himselfe. <hi>Magnentius</hi> another tyrant, and enemy to Christs Church, being overcome by <hi>Constantius,</hi> brother to <hi>Constans,</hi> whom he had slaine, fled to Lions, and there became his owne Butcher: whose death as soone as his brother <hi>Decentius</hi> understood, he also hanged himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galerius</hi> the Emperour, after he had tormented the Christians by all cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell means, and left no way unattempted whereby he might root them out of his Kingdome, fell into a grievous disease, through the torment whereof, not being able to endure any longer, he thrust a sword into his own bowels, and so miserably ended his dayes.</p>
               <p>And to come neerer to our owne age, in King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixths dayes one <hi>Clerke</hi> an open enemy to the Gospel, hanged himselfe in the Tower: so did <hi>Pavier</hi> Towne-clerke of London: so did the sonne of one <hi>Levar</hi> a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, that mocked and scorned at the holy Martyr master <hi>Latymer:</hi> so likewise did <hi>Henry Smith</hi> a Lawyer, another open adversary to Gods truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard Long,</hi> another enemy to Gods truth, drowned himselfe at Calice, in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eights dayes. <hi>Iohn Plankney,</hi> a Fellow of New Colledge in Oxford, did the like <hi>Anno</hi> 1566. and likewise one <hi>Hanington,</hi> a Fellow of the same Colledge, in a well at Padua; or, as some thinke, at Rome. Of these you may reade more in the first booke.</p>
               <p>Hither I might adde many examples of moderne experience, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a covetous wretch in the Isle of Elie, who being cast in a suit of Law, through impatience of griefe, came home and hanged himselfe: of another that had beene a great dealer in worldly matters, and an undoer of a Family or two of good credit and revenue, by usury, and taking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of bonds, and that by his owne flattering perswasion: being himselfe arrested at Huntington for debt, rather then he would satisfie it, though he
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59545:101"/>
was able enough, cut his owne throat, after a most fearefull and horrible manner: another being a man of note and good possessions, threw himselfe downe headlong from the top of a Church. Many such like examples I could adjoyne, with their names and places of abode, but I forbeare, least by reporting Gods judgements upon the dead, I should offend some that are alive.</p>
               <p>These therefore already proposed may be a sufficient taste of this kinde of judgement, inflicted by God upon wicked persons: and also may serve for a caveat and warning to all men to take heed how they offer violence to their owne lives, seeing it is not onely a punishment of sinne past, but a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sinne it selfe, and a forerunner and causer of punishment to come, even of eternall punishment, except the Lord extraordinarily and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously shew mercy, which none ought to presume of.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F all effusion of humane blood be both horrible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and repugnant to nature, then is the murdering of Parents especially detestable, when a man is so possessed with the Devill, or transported with a hellish fury, that he lifteth up his hand against his own father or mother, to put them to death: this is so monstrous and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous an impiety, that the greatest Barbarians ever have had it in detestation: wherefore it is also expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Law of God. That whosoever smiteth his father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Exod. 21.</note> in what sort so ever, though not to death, yet he shall die the death. If the disobedience, unreverence, and contempt of children towards their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, are by the just judgements of God most rigorously punished (as hath beene declared before in the first commandement of the second Table) how much more then when violence is offered, and above all, when murder is committed? Thus the Aegyptians punished this sinne: they put the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittants upon a stacke of thornes, and burnt them alive, having beaten their <note place="margin">Diodor. Sic.</note> bodies beforehand with sharpe reeds made of purpose. <hi>Solon</hi> being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded why he appointed no punishment in his Lawes for Paricides; answered, that there was no necessity, thinking that the wide world could not afford so wicked a wretch. It is said, that <hi>Romulus</hi> for the same cause ordained no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment in his Common wealth for that crime, but called every murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer a Paricide; the one being in his opinion a thing execrable, and the other impossible. And in truth there was not for 600 yeeres space (according to <hi>Plutarchs</hi> report) found in Rome any one that had committed this execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fact. The first Paricide that Rome saw, was <hi>Lucius Ostius,</hi> after the first Punicke warre; although other Writers affirme, that <hi>M. Malliolus</hi> was the first, and <hi>Lucius</hi> the second: how soever it was, they both underwent the punishment of the Law <hi>Pompeia,</hi> which enacted, That such offenders should be thrust into a sacke of Leather, and an Ape, a Cocke, a Viper, and a Dog, put in to accompany them, and then to be throwne into the water, to the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59545:102"/>
end that these beasts being enraged and animated one against another, might wreke their teene upon them, and so deprive them of life after a strange fashion, being debarred of the use of the aire, water, and earth, as unworthy to participate the very Elements with their deaths, much lesse with their lives: which kinde of punishment was after practised and confirmed by the constitution of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great. And albeit the regard of the punishment seemed terrible, and the offence it selfe much more monstrous, yet since that time there have beene many so perverse and exceeding wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as to throw themselves headlong into that desperate gulfe.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Cleodoricke</hi> sonne of <hi>Sigebert</hi> King of Austria, who being tickled with an unsatiable lust of raigne through the deceivable perswasions of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovius</hi>

                     <hi>Greg. of Tours, lib</hi> 2.</note> King of France, slew his father <hi>Sigebert</hi> as he lay asleepe in his Tent in a forrest at noone time of the day; who being weary with walking, laid himselfe downe there to take his rest: but for all that, the wicked wretch was so farre from attaining his purpose, that it fell out cleane contrary to his expectation: for after his fathers death, as he was viewing his treasures, and ransacking his coffers, one of <hi>Cleodovius</hi> factors strooke him suddenly, and murdered him, and so <hi>Cleodovius</hi> seised both upon the Crowne and Treasures.</p>
               <p>After the death of <hi>Hircanus, Aristobulus</hi> succeeded in the government of <note place="margin">Ioseph. antiq.</note> Judea, which whilest he strove to reduce into a kingdome, and to weare a crown, contrary to the custome of his predecessors, his mother &amp; other bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren contending with him about the same, he cast in prison, &amp; took <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his next brother to be his associate: but ere long (a good gratefull son) he famished her to death with hunger that had fed him to life with her teares, even his naturall mother: And after perswaded with false accusations, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his late best beloved <hi>Antigonus</hi> to be slaine by an ambush that lay by Strato's tower, because in the time of his sicknesse he entred the Temple with pompe. But the Lord called for quittance for the two bloodsheds immediately after the execution of them: for his brothers blood was scarce washed off the ground, ere in the extreamity of his sicknesse he was carried into the same place, and there vomiting up blood at his mouth and nost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hrils, to be mingled with his brothers, he fell downe starke dead, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horrible tokens of trembling and despaire.</p>

It is written of her, that when she saw there was no remedy but death, she presented her belly unto the murderer, and desired him to kill her in that part which had most deserved it, by bringing into the world so vile a monster: and of him, that he came to view the dead carkasse of his mother, and handled the members thereof, commending this, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending that, as his fancy led him, and in the meane time being thirsty, to call for drinke: so farre was he from all humanity and touch of Nature:
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59545:102"/>
but he that spared not to embrue his hands in her blood that bred him, was constrained ere long to offer violence to his own life, which was most deere unto him.</p>

                  <hi>Martin Luther</hi> was wont to report of his own experience this wonderfull history of a Locksmith, a yong man, riotous and vicious, who to find fuel for <note place="margin">Luther.</note> his luxury, was so bewitched that he feared not to slay his own father &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a hammer, to the end to gain their mony and possessions: after w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> cruell deed, he presently went to a shoomaker and bought him new shooes, leaving his old behind him, by the providence of God to be his accusers: for after an houre or two the slain bodies being found by the Magistrate, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition made for the murderer, no manner of suspition being had of him, he seeming to take such griefe therat. But the Lord that knoweth the secrets of the heart discovered his hypocrisie, and made his owne shooes which hee had left with the Shoomaker rise up to beare witnesse against him: for the blood which ran from his fathers wounds besprinckled them so, that thereof grew the suspition, and from thence the examination, and very soon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and last of all his worthy and lawfull execution. From hence we may learne for a generall trueth, that murder, never so secret, will ever by one means or other be discovered; the Lord will not suffer it to goe unpunished, so abominable it is in his sight.</p>

               <p>As it is repugnant to nature for children to deale thus cruelly with their parents, so it is more against nature for parents to murder their children: insomuch as naturall affection is of greater force in the descent than in the ascent, &amp; the love that parents bear their children, is greater than that which children redound to their Parents; because the childe proceedeth from the father, and not the father from the childe, as part of his fathers essence, and not the father of his: Can a man then hate his own flesh, or be a rooter out of that which himselfe planted? It is rare, yet sometimes it commeth to passe. Howbeit as the offence is in an high degree, so it is alwayes punished by some high judgement: as by these examples that follow shall appeare.</p>
               <p>The ancient Ammonites had an Idoll called <hi>Moloch</hi> to the which they offered their children in sacrifice: this Idoll, (as the Jewes write) was of a great stature, and hollow within, having seven chambers in his hollownesse, whereof one was to receive meat, another turtle Doves, the third a sheep, the fourth a ram, the fifth a calfe, the sixth an oxe, and the seventh a childe: his hands were alwayes extended to receive gifts; and when a childe was offered, they were made fire hot to burne it to death: none must offer the childe but the father: and to drowne the cries of it, the Chemarims (for so were the Priests of that Idoll called) made a noise with bels, cymbals and horns: thus is it written, that king <hi>Ahab</hi> offered his son, yea, and many of the children of Israel beside, as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> affirmeth: <hi>They offered</hi> (saith he) <hi>their</hi>

These murders being finished, the Diuell incarnate (for certaine no womanly nature was left in her) to take punishment of her selfe for the same, cut her owne throat; and albeit she survived nine dayes, and confessing her fault, dyed with teares and repentance, yet we see how it pleased God to arme her own hands against her selfe, as the fittest executioners of vengeance.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing then they that take away their neighbours lives doe not escape unpunished, (as by the former examples it appeareth) it must needs follow, that if they to whom the sword of Justice is committed of God, to represse wrongs, and chastise vices, do give over themselves to cruelties, and to kill and slay those whom they ought in duty to protect and defend, must receive a greater measure of punishment, according to the measure and quality of their offence. Such an one was <hi>Saul</hi> the first king of Israel; who albeit he ought to have beene sufficiently instructed out of the law of God in his duty in this behalfe: yet was hee so cruell and bloody-minded, as contrary to all Justice, to put to death <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> the high Priest, with fourescore and five other Priests, of the family of his father, onely for receiving <hi>David</hi> into his house: a small, or rather no offence. And yet not satisfied therewith, he vomited out his rage also against <note place="margin">1 Sam. 22.</note> the whole city of the Priests, and put to the mercilesse sword both man, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and child, without sparing any. He slew many of the Gibeonites, who though they were reliques of the Amorites that first inhabited that land, yet because they were received into league of amity by a solemne oath, and permitted of long continuance to dwell amongst them, should not have beene awarded as enemies, nor handled after so cruell a fashion. Thus therefore hee tyrannizing and playing the Butcher amongst his own subjects (for which cause his house was called the house of slaughter) and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing many other foule enormities, he was at the last overcome of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims, and sore wounded: which when he saw, fearing to fall alive into his enemies hands, and not finding any of his owne men that would lay their hands upon him, desperately slew himselfe. The same day three of his sons, and they that followed him of his owne houshould, were all slaine. The Philistims the next day finding his dead body dispoyled among the carkas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, beheaded it, and carried the head in triumph to the temple of their god, and hung up the trunke in disgrace in one of their Cities, to be seene, lookt upon, and pointed at. And yet for all this was not the fire of Gods wrath quenched: for in King <hi>Davids</hi> time there arose a famine that lasted three yeeres, the cause thereof was declared by God to be the murder which <hi>Saul</hi> committed upon the Gibeonites: wherefore <hi>David</hi> delivered <hi>Sauls</hi> seven <note place="margin">2 Sam. 21.</note> sons into the Gibeonites hands that were left, who put them to the most shamefull death, that is, even to hanging. Amongst all the sins of King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Kings 21.</note> and <hi>Iezabel,</hi> which were many and great, the murder of <hi>Naboth</hi> standeth in the fore front; for though hee had committed no such crime as might any way deserve death, yet by the subtill and wicked devise of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> foolish and credulous consent of <hi>Achab,</hi> and false accusation of the two sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned witnesses, he was cruelly stoned to death: but his innocent blood was punished first in <hi>Achab,</hi> who not long after the Warre which he made with the King of Syria, received so deadly a wound, that he dyed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the dogs licking up his blood in the same place where <hi>Naboths</hi> blood was licked, according to the foretelling of <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet. And secondly of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> whom her own servants at the commandement of <hi>Iehu</hi> (whom <note place="margin">2 Kings 9.</note> God had made executor of his wrath) threw headlong out of an highwindow unto the ground, so that the wals were dyed with her blood, and the horses trampled her under their feet, and dogs devoured her flesh, till of all her

                  <hi>Ioram</hi> sonne of <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> King of Judah, being after his fathers death <note place="margin">2 Chron. 21.</note> possessed of the Crowne and Scepter of Judah, by and by exalted himselfe in tyranny, and put to death sixe of his owne brethren, all younger than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, with many Princes of the Realme: for which cause God stirred up the Edomites to rebell, the Philistines and Arabians to make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, who forraged his countrey, sacked and spoiled his cities, and tooke prisoners his wives and children, the youngest onely excepted, who afterwards also was murdered, when he had raigned King but a small space. And lastly, as in doing to death his own brethren, he committed cruelty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his owne bowels, so the Lord stroke him with such an incurable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease in his bowels, and so perpetuall (for it continued two yeares) that his very entrails issued out with torment, and so he dyed in horrible misery.</p>
               <p>Albeit that in the former booke we have already touched the pride and arrogancy of King <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; yet we cannot pretermit to speake of him in this place, his example serving to fit for the present subject; for although as touching the rest of his life he was very well governed in his private actions, as a Monarch of his reputation might be, yet in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining age (I meane not in yeares, but to deathward) he grew exceeding cruell, not onely towards strangers, as the Cosseis, whom he destroyed to the sucking babe, but also to his houshold and familiar friends: Insomuch that being become odious to most, fewest loved him, and divers wrought all meanes possible to make him away, but one especially, whose sonne in law and other neere friends he had put to death, never ceased untill he both mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred a deadly draught unto himselfe, whereby he deprived him of his <note place="margin">Iustin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In his dominion there was one <hi>Perillus</hi> artificer of his craft, one expert in his occupation, who to flatter and curry favour with him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised a new torment, a brasen bull of such a strange workmanship, that the voyce of those that were roasted therein, resembled rather the roaring of a Bull, then the cry of men. The Tyran was well pleased with the Invention, but he would needs have the Inventor make first triall of his owne worke, as he well deserved, before any other should take taste thereof. But what was the end of this Tyran? The people not able any longer to endure his <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cic, Off.</hi> 2.</note> monstrous and unnaturall cruelties, ran upon him with one consent, with such violence, that they soone brought him to destruction: and as some say, put him into the brasen Bull (which hee provided to roast others) to bee roasted therein himselfe: deserving it as well for approoving the devise, as <hi>Perillus</hi> did for devising it.</p>

And he was so well beloved, that no man ever would or durst bestow a Sepulchre upon his dead bones, but suffered his body to lie in the open streets uncovered, save that a certaine harlot threw a few Roses upon his wounds, and so covered him.</p>

But this devise see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to no more purpose than a salve applyed to a sore out of season, when it was growne incureable, or a prop set to a house that is already falne. Therefore he tormented with the sting of his owne conscience, and finding in his minde no repose by day, nor rest by night, but a continuall summons and advertisement by fearefull dreames, that the Noblemen which hee had put to death, cryed to the people for revenge against him, was surprised with so terrible terrour, that forthwith, without making acquainted with his departure either his brother or his owne sonne, he fled to Sicilie, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in his journey, that the Frenchmen were still at his backe, and starting at every little noyse, as if he feared all the Elements had conspired his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.

But at length seeing the Neapolitanes ready to rebell, and himselfe in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be taken prisoner, he fled from the Castle of Naples, and with a small company got certaine Brigandines, wherein he sayled to the Island Ischia, thirty miles from Naples: saying at his departure this verse out of the Psalmes, <hi>How vaine are the watchmen and gards of that City which is not gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and watched by the Lord?</hi> which he often repeated, and so long as Naples was in his view.

               <p>There was (as <hi>Aelianus</hi> reporteth) a cruell and pernicious Tyran, who <note place="margin">Aelianus.</note> to the end to prevent all practises of conspiracy and treason (as Tyrans are ever naturally and upon desert timerous) that might be devised against him, enacted this Law among his subjects, That no man should conferre with another, either privately or publikely, upon paine of death: and so indeed he abrogated all civill society: (For speech, as it was the beginning and birth of fellowship, so it is the very joynt and glue thereof) but what cared he for society, that respected nothing but his owne safety? hee was so farre from regarding the common good, that when his subjects, not daring to speake, signified their mindes by signes, he prohibited that also: and that which is yet more, when not daring to speake, or yet make signes, they fell to weeping and lamenting their misery, he came with a band of men even
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59545:106"/>
to restraine their teares too: but the multitudes rage being justly incensed, they gave him such a desperat welcome, that neither he nor his followers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned one of them alive.

One of the noble sort he caused to be fastened to a stake, and beaten with clubbes, not to death, but to chastisement: which monstrous cruelty so incensed the peoples mind against him, that there wanted no hands to take part with this club-beaten man against the Tyran his enemie.

But to abridge these long discourses, let us looke into all times and ages, and to the histories of all Countries and Nations, and we shall finde, that Tyrans have ever come to one destruction or other.</p>

This is one of the foulest and vilest blots that can be, wherewith the honour and reputation of a man is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stayned, but blasted and blotted out, not ever to be recovered: for what perswasion can one have of such? Or who is so fond as to put affiance in them?</p>
               <p>This was one of the notorious vices of King <hi>Saul,</hi> when maligning the prosperity of <hi>David,</hi> he cunningly promoted him to be Generall of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and married him to one of his daughters, to this end, that by exposing <note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.</note> him to the hazards &amp; perils of warre, he might bring him to speedy destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; seeking besides other unlawfull means to put him to death by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but what was the end of this unjust murderer, we have declared in the former Chapter.</p>
               <p>But above all that by treason and deceit made way unto their cruelty, the Emperour <hi>Antonius,</hi> surnamed <hi>Caracalla,</hi> was the chiefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who to revenge <note place="margin">Herodian.</note> himselfe more at full upon the Citizens of Alexandria in Aegypt, feyned as if he would come see their City, built by <hi>Alexander,</hi> and receive an Oracle from their god: Which when he approached neere unto, the Alexandrians prepared to entertain him most honourably: and being entred, he went first to visite their Temples where to cast more colours upon his treachery, hee offered many sacrifices, &amp; in the mean while perceiving the people gathered together from all quarters to bid him welcome, finding opportunity fitting his wicked and traiterous enterprise, he gave commandement, that all the young men of the Citie should assemble together at one place; saying, That hee would acquaint them to range themselves in battell after the manner of the Macedonians, in honour of King <hi>Alexander.</hi> But whilest they thus assembled together in mirth and bravery, hee making as though he would bring them in array by going up and down amongst them, and holding them in talke, his army enclosed them on all sides: then with drawing himselfe with Kis guard, he gave the watch-word, that they should rush upon them; which was performed with such outrage, that the poor cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous people being surprised at unawares, were all most cruelly massacred. There might you see the most horrible, barbarous, and incredible butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of men that ever was heard of: for besides those that were actors in this bloody tragedy, there were others that drew the slaine bodies into great

ditches, and very often haled in them that were scarce dead, yea and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that were altogether alive; which was the cause that divers soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers perished at the same time, when those that having some strength of life left, being haled to the ditch, held so fast by the halers, that divers times both fell in together. The bloud that was shed at this massacre was so much, that the mouth of the River Nilus, and the sea shore were died with the streams thereof, that ran downe by smaller Rivers into those plain places. Furthermore, being desirous to obtain a victory over the Parthians, that he might get himselfe fame and reputation thereby, he passed not at what rate he bought it: he sent therefore Embassadours with Letters and Presents to the King of Parthia, to demand his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in marriage, though he never intended any such thing, and being non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suted at the first with a deniall, yet pursued he his counterfeit purpose with much earnestnes, and with solemne Oath protested his singular good affection and love that he bore unto her; so that in the end the match was condescended unto by all parties, whereof the Parthian people were not a little glad, in hope of so durable a peace, which by this marriage was like to be established betwixt them. The King therefore with all his subjects being ready to entertain this new Bridegroom, went out with one consent to meet him in the mid-way: their encounter was in a fair plain, where the Parthians having sent backe their horses, being unarmed, and prepared, not for a day of battle, but of marriage and disport, gave him the most honourable welcome they could: but the wicked varlet finding opportunity so fit, set his armed souldiers upon the naked multitude, and hewed in pieces the most part of them; and had not the King with a few followers bestirred him well, he had been served with the like sauce. After which worthy exploit and bloudy stratagem he took his voyage <note place="margin">Treason, <hi>lib</hi> 2. <hi>cap</hi> 3</note> backeward, burning and spoiling the townes and villages as he went, till he arrived at Charam, a City in Mesopotamia; where making his abode a while, he had a fancy to walke one day into the fields, and going apart from his company to unburden nature, attended upon by one onely ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, as he was putting downe his breeches, another of his company ran in and strucke him through with his dagger.

Which offer and gift the Gothes accepting, did accordingly fulfill the condition, and passed away, without commiting any riot or any damages in their passages. But as they were upon mount Cinis, making toward France, behold <hi>Stilico, Honorius</hi> his father in law (a man of a stirring, stubborne, and rash spirit) pursueth and chargeth them with battell unawares, and dreaming of nothing lesse: whereat they, being at the instant amazed, quickly gathered their spirits together, and putting themselves in defence, fought it out with such cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and eagernesse, that the traitors Army was wholly discomfited, and he himselfe with one of his sonnes, slain. The Gothes having gotten this victory, broke off their voyage to France, and turned their course backe again to Italie, with purpose to destroy and spoil; and so they did; for they laid waste all the Countrey of Piemont and Lumbardy, and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and besieged Rome it selfe: so that from that time Italie never ceased to be scourged and tormented with the Gothes for the space of eighteen yeers. Moreover, whosoever else have been found to follow the steps of these truce, peace, and promise-breakers (void of truth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of reputation) alwayes underwent worthy punishment for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy acts, and fell headlong into confusion and ignominy, making themselves subjects worthy to be curst and detested of all men.</p>

They as foolish as himselfe, not willing to crosse his minde, and fearing to lose him in the prease, tied him faste to the raines of their bridles, being by this meanes so coupled together, as if they meant all to perish together if need were, as indeed they did, for they were overcome in battell, and the next day found all dead, horse and men faste bound together.

On the Emperours side died many worthy men, among whom <hi>Conrade</hi> the Emperours son in law, and <hi>Burg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard</hi> Duke of Suevia were two, beside many other. In this successive bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, it is to be noted above the rest, how religiously the Emperour both began and finished it: the day before the Fight he enjoyned a Faste in his Army, and directed his prayers to the Almighty, relying more upon the presence of Gods helpe, than his owne power: after the Conquest gotten, he caused solemne thankes to be given in all Churches to God, for the great deliverance. I would our moderne Generals and Captaines would learne by this example to follow his footsteps, and not to make their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers quaffings, and their thanksgiving carousings, as they use to do, even as it were purposely to tempt the Lord, and to stir up his wrath against them.</p>

The first (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Seneca)</hi> that devised and put in practice this unkindely Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of Beasts and Malefactours, was <hi>Pompey,</hi> who provided an Army of <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> eighteen Elephants to fight with men, and thought it a notable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable spectacle to put men to death after this new and strange fashion. Oh how mens mindes are blinded with over much prosperity! He esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe at that time to be higher in dignity than all other, when he thus threw to wilde beasts people of farre Countries, and in the presence of the people caused so much bloud to be shed: but not long after himselfe was betrayed by the treachery of the Alexandrians, and slain by a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave (a just quittance for murdering so many of that condition:) thus much of <hi>Seneca.</hi> Now it is manifest that this was an ordinary pastime among the Romans, albelt it is strange, that any pastime or pleasure could arise by seeing poor Creatures interchangeably strike one another to death, and humane bloud to run like water along the streets.</p>

               <p>A certain bondslave too roughly handled by his master, forsook him, and fled away, and in his flight retiring into a desart, and not knowing how to bestow himselfe, took up a cave for his lodging, where he had not long abode, but a mighty Lion came halting to his den, with a sore and bloudy leg: the poor slave all forgone at this strange and ugly sight, looked every minute to be devoured, but the Lion in another mood came fawningly and softly towards him, as if he would complain unto him of his grief: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at (somewhat heartened) he bethought himselfe to apply some medicine to his would, and to binde up the sore as well as he could; which he had no sooner done, but the Lion made out for his prey, and ere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>long returning, brought home to his Host and Chirurgion certain gobbets of raw flesh, which he halfe roasting upon a rocke by the Sun-beames, made his daily sustenance, for the time of his abode there: notwithstanding at length wearied with this old and savage life, and hating to abide long in that estate, he for sook the desart, and put himselfe again to adventure: now it chanced that he was taken by his old master, and carried from Aegypt to Rome, to the end to be an actor in those beastly Tragoedies; but by chance his old patient the Lion (taken also since his departure, being ready amongst other beasts to play his part) knew him by and by, and ran unto him, fawning and making much of him: the people wondring at this strange accident, after enquiry made of the cause thereof, gave him the Lion, and caused him to lead him in a string through the City for a miracle: for indeed both this and the former deserve no other name. Thus God reproveth the savage inhumanity of men, by the example of the wilde and furious beasts at whose teeth poor servants found more favour than at their masters hands.</p>

Thereupon the Popes Legate published Pardons for all those that would crosse themselves to go to war against the Turke. Whereupon suddenly there gathered together a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull company of thieves and robbers, from every corner of Hungary, who together with great multitudes of the common people that were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by the insolency of the Nobility (creating themselves a Generall) committed a most horrible spoil almost over all Hungary; murdering all the Gentlemen and Bishops they could meet withall: the richest and those which were noblest descended, they empailed alive. This cruell rage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, at last the King raised Forces against them, and ere long they were defeated in a set battle, by <hi>Iohn</hi> the son of Vayvod <hi>Stephen,</hi> who having cut the most of them in pieces, took their Leaders, and put them to death by such strange torments as I have horrour to remember: for the Generall of this seditious troop, called <hi>George,</hi> he caused to be stript naked, and a Crowne of hot burning iron to be set upon his head; then some of his veines to be opened, and made <hi>Lucatius</hi> his brother to drinke the bloud which issued out of them. After that, the chiefest of the Peasants, who had been kept three dayes without meat, were brought forth, and forced to fall up on the body of <hi>George</hi> (yet breathing) with their teeth, and every one to tear away and eat a piece of it. Thus he being torne in pieces, his bowels were pulled out, and cut into morsels, whereof some being boyled, and the rest roasted, the Prisoners were constrained to feed on them: which done, all that remained were put to most horrible and languishing deaths. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of greater cruelty can hardly be found since the world was a world, and therefore no marvell if the Lord hath punished the King and Realme of Hungary, for such strange cruelties, by suffering the cruell Turkes to make spoil of them. Cruell chastisements are prepared for them that be cruell and inhumane.</p>

But some moneths after he fell sicke, and languished many dayes of an extreme pain in the reines of his back; through the torment whereof he fell into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, and ceased not to curse and deny his Creatour, who is blessed for ever, untill that both speech and life failed him. Neither did the severity of Gods justice here stay, but shewed it selfe on his posterity also; for his eldest son seeking to exalt the prowesse and valour of his father, vaunted much of his fathers exploits in an open assembly at a banquet; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall a countriman being moved, stabbed him to the heart with his dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and some few dayes after the Plague fals among the residue of his Family, and consumeth all that remaineth.</p>

As every one ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and care to their honesty, so maides especially, whose whole credit and reputation hangeth thereupon; for they that make no account thereof, but suffer themselves to be polluted with any filthinesse, draw upon them not onely most vile infamy, but also many great miseries: as is proved by the daughter of <hi>Hippomenes</hi> Prince of Athens, who being a whore, her father shut up in a stable with a wilde horse, giving him no provender, nor other meat to eat, that the horse (naturally furious enough, but more enraged by famine) might tear her in pieces, and with her carkase refresh his hunger, as he did. <hi>Pontus Aufidian</hi> understanding that his daughter had been betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and sold into a lechers hands by a slave of his that was her schoolmaster; put them both to death. In like manner served <hi>Pub.

The same Authour saith, That when he was a young man, there were three in the same Countrey, that conspired the death of a companion of theirs, that went about to commit this villany, and as they conspired, so they performed it, strangling him to death with a napkin, as he was going to his filthinesse. As for Adulterers, examples are infinite both of their wicked lives and miserable ends. In which number many of them may be scored, that making profession of a single life; and undertaking the vow of chastity, shew themselves monstrous knaves and ribauds, as many of the Popes themselves have done.

He also procured the Earle of Kent, the Kings uncle, to be arraigned and beheaded at Winchester, for that he withstood the Queenes and his dealings, and would not suffer them to do what they listed. All these mischiefes sprung out from the filthy root of Adultery. But the just judgement of God not permitting such odious crimes to be unpunished nor undetected, it so fell forth at the length, that <hi>Isabel</hi> the old Queen was discovered to be with childe by the said <hi>Mortimer:</hi> whereof complaint being made to the King, as also of the killing of King <hi>Edward</hi> his father, and conspiring and procuring the death of the Earle of Kent the Kings uncle, he was arreigned and indicted, and by verdict found guilty, and suffered death accordingly like a Traitor, his head being exalted upon Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-bridge, for a spectacle for all murderers and adulterers to behold, that they might see and fear the heavy vengeance of God.</p>

Now the report of this massacre was so fearfull and terrible, that the Spaniards which were in Cubagna doubted much of their lives also; and truly not without great cause: for if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the Continent had been furnished and provided with sufficient store of barkes, they had passed even into that Island, and had served them with the same sauce which their fellowes were served with; for they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not will, but ability to do it.

There needed no more spurres to pricke him forward for revenge: he posteth to the Court, and upbraiding the Queen with her ungratefull and abominable treachery, runneth her through with his sword, and taking her heart in his hand, proclaimeth openly, that it was not a deed of inconsideration, but of judgement, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the losse of his wives chastity: forthwith he flieth towards the King his Lord, that now was at Constantinople, and declaring to him his fact, and shewing to him his sword besmeared with his wives bloud,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59545:115"/>
submitteth himselfe to his sentence, either of death in rigour, or pardon in compassion: but the good King enquiring the truth of the cause, though grieved with the death of his wife, yet acquit him of the crime, and held him in as much honour and esteem as ever he did; condemning also his wife as worthy of that which she had endured, for her unwomanlike and traiterous part. A notable example of justice in him, and of punishment in her, that forgetting the law of womanhood and modesty, made her selfe a Bawd unto her brothers lust: whose memory as it shall be odious and execrable, so his justice deserveth to be engraven in marble with characters of gold.</p>
               <p>Equal to this King in punishing a Rape, was <hi>Otho</hi> the first: for as he passed through Italy with an Army, a certain woman cast her selfe downe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Albert, Crantz. lib.</hi> 3.</note> at his feet for justice against a villain that had spoiled her of her chastity; who deferring the execution of the law till his returne, because his haste was great, the woman asked, who should then put him in minde thereof? he answered, This Church which thou seest shall be a witnesse betwixt me and thee, that I will then revenge thy wrong. Now when he had made an end of this warfare, in his returne, as he beheld the Church, he called to minde the woman, and caused her be fetched; who falling downe before him, desired now pardon for him whom before she had accused, seeing he had now made her his wife, and redeemed his injury with sufficient satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: not so I swear (quoth <hi>Otho)</hi> your compacting shall not infringe, or colludo the sacred Law, but he shall die for his former fault, and so he caused him to be put to death. A notable example for them, that after they have committed filthinesse with a maid, thinke it no sin, but competent amends, if they take her in marriage whom they abused before in forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Nothing inferiour to these in punishing this sin, was <hi>Gonzaga</hi> Duke of Ferrara, as by this History following may appear. In the year 1547. a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen <note place="margin">Theat. hist.</note> of Comun was cast into Prison upon an accusation of murder, whom to deliver from the judgement of death, his wife wrought all meanes possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: therefore comming to the Captain that held him Prisoner, she sued to him for her husbands life; who upon condition of her yeelding to his lust and payment of two hundred Ducats, promised safe deliverance for him; the poor woman seeing that nothing could redeem her husbands life, but losse and shipwracke of her owne honesty, told her husband: who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her to yeeld to the Captaines desire, and not to pretermit so good an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; wherefore she consented: but after the pleasure past, the traiterous and wicked Captain put her husband to death notwithstanding: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury when she complained to <hi>Gonzaga</hi> Duke of Ferrara, he caused the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain first to restore backe her two hundred Ducats, with an addition of seven hundred Crownes, and secondly to marry her to his wife; and lastly, when he hoped to enjoy her body, to be hanged for his treachery.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst all other things, this is especially to be noted, how God (for a greater punishment of the disordinate lust of men) strucke them with a new (yet filthy and stinking) kinde of Disease called the French Pox; though indeed the Spaniards were the first that were infected therewith, by the heat which they caught <note place="margin">Paul. Iovius.

From whence the contagion spread it selfe throughout di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of Europe. Barbary was so over-growne with it, that in all their Cities the tenth part escaped not untouched, nay almost not a Family but was infected. From thence it ran to Aegypt, Syria, and the graund Cair; and it may near hand truly be said, that there was not a corner of the habitable world, where this not onely new and strange (for it was never heard of in antient ages) but terrible and hideous scourge of Gods wrath stretched not it selfe. They that were spotted with it, and had it rooted in their bodies, led a languishing life, full of aches and torments, and carried in their visages filthy markes of unclean behaviour, as ulcers, boyles, and such like, that greatly disfigured them. And herein we see the words of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> verified, <hi>That an Adulterer sinneth against his owne body.</hi> Now for so much as the world is so brutishly carried into this sin, as to none more, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 18.</note> the Lord therefore hath declared his anger against it in divers sorts, so that divers times he hath punished it in the very act, or not long after, by a strange death. Of which, <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> one of the great Captaines of Athens, <note place="margin">Sabell.</note> may stand for an example; who being polluted with many great and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59545:117"/>
odious vices, and much given to his pleasures, and subject to all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, ended his life in the midst thereof: for as he was in company of a Phrygian strumpet (having flowne thither to the King of Phrygia for shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) was notwithstanding set upon by certain Guards, which the King (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by his enemies) sent to stay him; but they though in number many, through the conceived opinion of his notable valour, durst not apprehend him at hand, but set fire to the house, standing themselves in armes round about it, to receive him if need were: he seeing the fire, leaped through the midst of it, and so long defended himselfe amongst them all, till strength failed in himselfe, and blowes encreasing upon him, constrained him to give up his life amongst them.</p>

And thus the abhominable lecher, together with his rabble of filthy Pandars, received the due reward of their ugly filthinesse; and by this means the Irish Nation was freed from the slavery of a cruell Tyran.</p>

There is nothing that can cast any colour of excuse upon it, seeing it is expresly contrary to Gods ediet in many places: as first, <hi>Thou shalt not commit Adultery:</hi> and in Lev. 19. 29. <hi>Thou shalt not pollute thy daughter in prostituting her to be a where, lest the land be defiled with wheredom, and filled with wickednesse:</hi> and in Deut. 23. 17. <hi>Let there be no where of the daughters of Israel, neither a where-keeper of the sonnes of Israel.</hi> This is the decree of God, and the rule which he had given us to square our affections by, and it admitteth no dispensation. But some do object, that those things are tolerated to avoid greater mischiefes: as though the Lord were not well advised when he gave forth those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, or that mortall men had more discretion than the immortall God. This truely is nothing else but to reject and disannull that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> requireth as a duty of all Christians; namely, That fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Ephes. 5.</note> and all uncleannesse should not once be named amongst us, neither filthinesse, foolish talking, or jesting, which are things not comely; forsomuch as no whoremonger nor unclean person can have any inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the Kingdom of God. <hi>Plate</hi> the Philosopher, though a Panim, and <note place="margin">

In this therefore the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then are a shame and reproach to those that call themselves Christians and Catholiques. Besides, the goodly reason which they alleage for their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of their Stues is so far from the truth, that the contrary is ever truer; namely, that by their odious and dishonest liberty more evill ariseth to the world than otherwise would, insomuch as it setteth open a wide door to all dissolutenesse and whoredomes, and an occasion of lechery and uncleannesse even to those that otherwise would abstain from all such filthy actions.

He used (as <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> was wont to do) to maintain whole heards of whores, with whom he participated his friends and servants as they stood in need, and by Adulteries reared yearly great revenues into his purse. <hi>Baleus</hi> saith, That at this day every whore in Rome payes tribute to the Pope, a Iulle; which amounted then to twenty thousand Ducats by the year at least; but now the number is so encreased, that it ariseth to fourty thousand. I thinke there is none ignorant, how Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third had by computation five and fourty thousand whores and curtezans, that paid him a monethly tribute for their whoredomes: and thus also this holy Father was a protectour and upholder of the Stues, and deserved by his villanous behaviour (for he was one of the lewdest Adulterers of that time) to bear the name of the master and erectour of these filthy places: and herein both he and the rest of that crue have shewed themselves enemies to God, and true Antichrists indeed, and have not onely imitated, but far surpassed shamelesse and wicked <hi>Caligula</hi> in all filthy and monstrous dealings.

               <p>In the reigne of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Ninth, King of France, and <hi>Iulius</hi> the Second, Pope of Rome, there was a Gentleman of Naples called <hi>Antonio Bologne,</hi> that had been Governour of <hi>Fredericke</hi> of Arragons house, when he was King of Naples, and had the same Office under the Duchesse of Malfi after she was widow; with whom in protract of time he grew to have such secret and privie acquaintance (albeit she was a princesse and he her servant) that he enjoyeed her as his owne wife. And thus they conversed secretly together under the colour of Marriage accorded betwixt them, the space of certain yeares, untill she had bore unto him three children: by which meanes their private dealings which they so much desired to smother and keep close, burst out and bewrayed it selfe. The matter being come to her brothers eares, they took it so to the heart, that they could not rest untill they had revenged the vile injury and dishonour which they pretended to have been done to them and their whole house, equally by them both. Therefore when they had chased them first from Ancona, whither in hope of quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse they had fled out of Naples, they drave them also out of Tuscane: who seeing themselves so hotly pursued on every side, resolved to make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Venice, thinking there to finde some safety: But in the midway she was overtaken, and brought backe to Naples, where in short space she mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably ended her life: for her brothers Guard strangled her to death, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with her chambermaid, who had served in stead of a Baud to them; and her poor infants which she had by the said <hi>Bologne.</hi> But he by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his horse escaping, took his flight to Milan, where he sojourned quietly a long while, untill at the instant pursuit of one of her brothers,

And this was a true Cardinall like exploit indeed, representing that mildenesse, mercifulnesse, and good nature which is so required of every Christian, in traiterously murdering a man so many yeares after the first rancour was conceived, that might well in halfe that space have been digested, in fostering hatred so long in his cruell heart, and waging ruffians and murderers to commit so monstrous an act: wherein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beir the Cardinals cruelty was most famous, as also in putting to death the poor infants, yet Gods justice bare the sway, that used him as an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to punish those who under the vail of secret Marriage thought it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them to commit any villany.

Now then it were far better to marry than to burne; yet in such sort to marry, that all giddinesse and inconsideration set aside, every one should matcht himselfe according to his degree and age, with great respect and good advisement had unto them both, to the end to avoid those mischiefes and enormities which oftentimes happen, when either by an over-hardy, foolish, and rash presumption, a man would nestle himselfe in an higher nest than his estate and calling requireth, or by a sensuall and fleshly lust passing the bounds of

reason, goeth about to constrain and interrupt the law of nature. The chiefest thing that is required in Marriage, is the consent of parties, as well of themselves that are to be joyned together, as of each of their parents; the contrary whereof is constraint, where either party is forced: as it hapned to those two hundred maids which the Benjamites took by force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to be their wives. <note place="margin">Judg. 21.</note>

               <p>This was a reproach to <hi>Romulus</hi> the first King of Rome, when he ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sabine virgins that came to see their sports, which was cause of great war betwixt them. Moreover besides the mutuall joint of love which ought to be betwixt man and wife, it is necessary that they that marry do marry in the Lord, to serve him in greater purity, and with lesse distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance; which cannot be if a Christian marry an Infidell, for the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and hinderances that usually spring from such a root. Therefore it was straitly forbidden the people of God to contract Marriages with Idolaters; yea, and the holy Patriarchs before any such law was given, had <note place="margin">Exod. 34. 16. Deut. 7. 3.</note> carefully great regard (in the Marriages of their children) to this thing, as the example of <hi>Abraham</hi> doth sufficiently declare. Therefore they that have any manner of government and authority over unmarried folkes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be fathers, morthers, kinsmen, or Tutors, ought to have especiall care and regard thereof. Yea, Christian Princes and Lords, or Rulers of Common-wealths, should not in this respect be so supine and negligent in the performance of their Offices, as once to permit and suffer this amongst them, which is so directly contrary to the Word of God; but rather by especiall charge forbid it, to the end that both their Lawes might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable, and in every respect agreeable to the holy Ordinance of God; and that the way might be stopped to those mischiefes which were likely to arise from such evil concluded Marriages. For what reason is it that a young maid baptised and brought up in the Church of Christ, should be given in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to a worshipper of Images and Idols; and sent to such a Countrey where the worship of God is not so much as once thought upon? Is not this to plucke a soul out of the House of God, and thrust it into the house of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill? out of Heaven, into Hell? than which, what greater apostasie or falling from God can there be? whereof all they are guilty, that either make up such Marriages; or give their good will or consent to them, or do not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cause and proceedings of them, if any manner of way they can. Now that this confusion and mixture of Religion in Marriages is unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and noysom to God, it manifestly appeareth <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. where it is said, that because the sonnes of God (to wit, those whom God had separated for himselfe from the beginning of the world to be his peculiar ones,) were so evill advised, as to be allured with the beauties of the daughters of men, (to wit, of those which were not chosen of God to be his people; and to marry with them, corrupting themselves by this contagious acquaintance of prophane people, with whom they should have had nothing to do) that therefore God was incensed against them, and resolved simply to revenge the wickednesse of each party without respect. Beside, the monstrous fruits of those prophane Marriages, do sufficiently declare their odiousnesse in Gods sight: for from them arose gyants of strength and stature, exceeding the proportion of men, who by their hugenesse did much wrong and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the world, and gained fearfull and terrible names to themselves: but God (provoked by their oppressions) drowned their tyrannies in the Floud, and made an end of the world for their sakes.</p>

In the time of the Judges in Israel, the Israelites were chastised by the hand of God for this same fault; for they tooke to wives the daughters of the uncircumcised, and gave them their daughters also. In like sort framed <note place="margin">Judges 3.</note> they themselves by this meanes to their corrupt manners and superstitions, and to the service of their Idolatrous gods: but the Lord of heaven raigned downe anger upon their heads, and made them subject to a stranger, the King of Mesopotamia, whom they served the space of eight yeares.</p>

                  <hi>Anton. Caracalla</hi> tooke to wife his mother in law, allured thereunto by her faire enticements: whose wretched and miserable end hath already been touched in the former booke.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Heraclius,</hi> after the decease of his first wife, married his
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59545:121"/>

               <p>Thus many men run ryot, by assuming to themselves too much liberty, and breake the bounds of civill honesty required in all Contracts, and too audaciously set themselves against the commandement of God, which ought to be of such authority with all men, that none (be they never so great) should dare to derogate one jot from them, unlesse they meant wholly to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselves as profest enemies to God himselfe, and to turne all the good order of things into confusion. All which notwithstanding, some of the Romish Popes have presumed to encroach upon Gods right, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anull by their foolish decrees the lawes of the Almighty: As <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixth did, who by his Bull approved the incestuous marriage of <hi>Ferdinand</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, King of England, after the death of his eldest son <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur,</hi> caused (by the speciall dispensation of Pope <hi>Iulius)</hi> his next son named <hi>Henry,</hi> to take to wife his brothers widdow called <hi>Katherine,</hi> daughter to <hi>Ferdinando</hi> King of Spaine, for the desire he had to have this Spanish affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty continued: who succeeding his father in the Crowne, after continuance of time, began to advise himselfe, and to consult whether this marriage with his brothers wife were lawfull or no; and found it by conference both of holy and prophane lawes utterly unlawfull: whereupon he sent certaine Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to the Queene to give her to know, That the Popes dispensation was altogether unjust, and of none effect to priviledge such an act: to whom she answered, That it was too late to call in question the Popes Bull which so long time they had allowed of. The two Cardinals that were in Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Pope to decide the controversie, and to award judgement upon the matter, were once upon point to conclude the decree which the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, had not the Pope impeached their determination in regard of the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> nephew to the said Queene, whom he was loath to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please: wherefore the King seeing himselfe frustrate of his purpose in this behalfe, sent into divers Countries to know the judgement of all the learned Divines concerning the matter in controversie, who (especially those that dwelt not far off) seemed to allow and approve the divorce: Thereupon he resolved (rejecting his olde wife) to take him to a new, and to marrie (as he did) <hi>Anne</hi> of Bulloine one of the Queenes maides of honour, a woman of most rare and excellent beauty. Now as touching his first marriage with his brothers wife, how unfortunate it was in it owne nature, and how unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispensed withall by the Pope, we shall anon see by those heavy, sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and troublesome events and issues which immediatly followed in the neck thereof.</p>
               <p>And first and formest of the evill fare of the Cardinall of Yorke, with whom the King being highly displeased for that at his instance and request, the Pope had opposed himselfe to this marriage, requited him (and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deservedly) on this manner: first he deposed him from the office of the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59545:121"/>
Chancellorship: secondly, deprived him of two of his three bishoprickes which he held: and lastly, sent him packing to his owne bouse, as one whom he never purposed more to see: yet afterward being advertised of certaine insolent and threatning speeches which he used against him, he sent againe for him: but he not daring to refuse to come at his call, dyed in the way with meere griefe and despight. The Pope gave his definitive sentence against this act, and favoured the cause of the divorced Ladie: but what gained he by it, save only that the King, offended with him, rejected him and all his trumpery, retained his yearely tribute levied out of this Realm, and converted it to another use: and this was the recompence of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispensation with an incestuous marriage: wherein although, to speake truly and properly, he lost nothing of his owne, yet it was a deep check and no shallow losse to him and his successors, to be deprived of so goodly a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, and so great authority in this Realme, as he then was.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing that marriage is so holy an institution and ordinance of God, as it hath been shewed to be; it followeth by good right that the corruption thereof, namely Adultery, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the bond of marriage is dissolved, should be forbidden: for the woman that is polluted therewith, despiseth her owne husband, yea and for the most part hateth him, and foisteth in strange seed (even his enemies brats) in stead of his owne, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be fathered, but also to be brought up and maintained by him, and in time to be made inheritors of his possessions: which thing being once knowne, must needes stir up coales to set anger on fire, and set abroach much mischiefe: and albeit that the poore infants are innocent and guiltlesse of the crime, yet doth the punishment and ignominie thereof redound to them, because they cannot be reputed as legitimate, but are even marked with the black coale of bastardy whilest they live: so grievous is the guilt of this sin, and uneasie to be removed. For this cause the very Heathen not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproved adultery evermore, but also by authority of law prohibited it, and allotted to death the offenders therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abimelech</hi> King of the Philistims, a man without circumcision, and <note place="margin">Gen. 26.</note> therefore without the covenant, knowing by the light of nature (for hee knew not the law of God) how sacred and inviolable the knot of marriage ought to be, expresly forbad all his people from doing any injury to <hi>Isaac</hi> in regard of his wife, and from touching her dishonestly upon paine of death. Out of the same fountaine sprang the words of queene <hi>Hecuba</hi> in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides,</hi> speaking to <hi>Menelaus</hi> touching <hi>Helen,</hi> when she admonished him to enact this law, That every woman which should betray her husbands cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and her owne chastity to another man, should die the death.</p>
               <p>In olde time the Aegyptians used to punish adultery on this sort; the <note place="margin">Diedor.</note> man with a thousand jerkes with a reed, and the woman with cutting off her nose; but he that forced a free woman to his lust, had his privy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59545:122"/>
cut off. By the law of <hi>Iulia,</hi> adulterers were without difference adjug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death, insomuch that <hi>Iulius Antonius,</hi> a man of great parentage and reputation among the Romanes, whose son was nephew to <hi>Augustus</hi> sister (as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> reporteth) was for this crime executed to death. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relianus</hi>

                  </note> the Emperour did so hate and detest this vice, that to the end to scare and terrifie his souldiers from the like offence, he punished a souldier which had committed adultery with his hostesse in most severe manner, even by causing him to be tyed by both his feet to two trees bent downe to the earth with force, which being let goe, returning to their course, rent him cruelly in pieces, the one halfe of his body hanging on the one tree, and the other on the other. Yea and at this day amongst the very Turkes and Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, this sin is sharply punished. So that we ought not wonder that the Lord should ordaine death for the Adulterer. If a man (saith the law) lie with another mans wife, if (I say) he commit adultery with his neighbours <note place="margin">Levit. 20. 10.</note> wife, the Adulterer and the Adulteresse shall die the death. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, If a man be found lying with a woman married to a man, they <note place="margin">Deut. 22. 22.</note> shall die both twaine; to wit, the man that lay with the wife, and the wife, that thou maiest put away evill from Israel. Yea, and before <hi>Moses</hi> time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, it was a custome to burne the Adulterers with fire, as it appeareth by <note place="margin">Gen. 38.</note> the sentence of <hi>Iuda</hi> (one of the twelve Patriarchs) upon <hi>Thamar</hi> his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in law, because he supposed her to have played the whore. Beside all this, to the end this sin might not be shuffled up and kept close, there was a meanes given, whereby if a man did but suspect his wife for this sin, though she could by no witnesse or proofe be convinced, her wickednesse notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing most strangely and extraordinarily might be discovered. And it was this: The woman publikely at her husbands suit called in question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Num. 5.</note> the Priest, who was to give judgement of her after divers ceremonies and circumstances performed, and bitter curses pronounced by him, her belly would burst, and her thigh would rot, if she were guilty, and she should be a curse amongst the people for her sin; but if she was free, no evill would come unto her. Thus it pleased God to make knowne, that the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse of those that are polluted with this sin, should not be hid. This may more clearely appeare by the example of the Levites wife, of whom it is spoken in the 19, 20, and 21. Chapters of <hi>Iudges,</hi> who having forsaken her husband to play the whore, certaine moneths after he had againe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her to be his wife, she was given over against her will to the villanous <note place="margin">Rape, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 19.</note> and monstrous lusts of the most wicked and perverse Gibeonites, that so abused her for the space of a whole night together, that in the morning she was found dead upon the threshold: which thing turned to a great destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and overthrow in Israel; for the Levite, when he arose, and found his wife newly dead at the dore of his lodging, he cut and dismembred her body into twelve pieces, and sent them into all the countries of Israel, to every tribe one, to give them to understand, how vile and monstrous an injurie was done unto him: whereupon the whole nation assembling and consulting together, when they saw how the Benjamites (in whose tribe this monstrous villany was committed) make no reckoning of seeing punishment executed upon those execrable wretches, they tooke armes against them, and made war upon them; wherein though at the first conflict they lost to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of forty thousand men, yet afterward they discomfited and overthrew the Benjamites, and slew of them 25000. rasing and burning downe the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59545:122"/>
City Gibea (where the sinne was committed) with all the rest of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that Tribe, in such sort that there remained alive but six hundred persons, that saved their lives by flying into the desart, and there hid themselves foure moneths, untill such time as the Israelites taking pitty of them, lest they should utterly be brought to nought, gave them to wife (to the end to repeople them againe) foure hundred virgins of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Jabes Gilead, reserved out of that flaughter of those people, wherein man, woman, and childe, were put to the sword, for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth to take part with their brethren in that late warre. And foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as yet there remained two hundred of them unprovided for, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients of Israel gave them liberty to take by force two hundred of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their people: which could not be but great injury and vexation unto their parents, to be thus robbed of their daughters, and to see them married at all adventures, without their consent or liking. These were the mischiefes which issued and sprang from that vile and abominable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery of the wicked Gibeonites with the Levites wife, whose first vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary sinne was in like manner also most justly punished by this second rape: and this is no new practise of our most just God, to punish one <note place="margin">One sin puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> sinne by another, and sinners in the same kinde wherein they have offended.</p>
               <p>When King <hi>David,</hi> after he had overcome the most part of his enemies, <note place="margin">2 Sam. 11.</note> and made them tributaries unto him, and injoyed some rest in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whilest his men of war pursuing their victory, destroyed the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites, and were in besieging Rabba their chiefe City, he was so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the beauty of <hi>Bathshabe, Vriahs</hi> wife, that he caused her to bee conveyed to him to lye with her: to which sinne he combined another more grievous; to wit, when he saw her with childe by him (to the end to cover his adultery) he caused her husband to be slaine at the siege, by putting him in the Vantgard of the battell at the assault; and then think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe cocksure, married <hi>Bathshabe.</hi> But all this while, as it was but vaine allurements, no solid joy that fed his minde, and his sleepe was but of sinne, not of safety, wherein he slumbred: so the Lord awakened him right soone by afflictions and crosses, to make him feele the burden of the sinne which he had committed: first therefore the childe (the fruit of this adultery) was striken with sicknesse and dyed: next his daughter <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, Absaloms</hi> sister, was ravished by <hi>Ammon</hi> one of his owne sonnes: <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 2 Sam. 13.</note> thirdly <hi>Ammon</hi> for his incest was slaine by <hi>Absalom:</hi> and fourthly <hi>Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> (ambitiously aspiring after the kingdome, and conspiring against him) <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.</note> raised war upon him, and defiled his Concubines, and came to a wofull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. All which things (being grievous crosses to K. <hi>David)</hi> were infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the just hand of God, to chastise and correct him for his good, not to destroy him in his wickednesse: neither did it want the effect in him, for he was so far from swelling and hardening himselfe in his sin, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise he cast downe and humbled himselfe, and craved pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse at the hand of God with all his heart, and true repentance: not like to such as grow obstinate in their sinnes and wickednesse, and make themselves beleeve all things are lawfull for them, although they be never so vile and dishonest. This therefore that we have spoken concerning <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> is not to place him among the number of lewd and wicked livers, but to shew by his chastisements (being a man after Gods owne heart) how
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59545:123"/>
odious and displeasant this sin of Adultery is to the Lord, and what punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all others are to expect that wallow therein, since he spared not him whom he so much loved and favoured.</p>

In this torture the wretched lecher abode so long, untill he gnew off the flesh from his owne shoulders, and the eleventh day of his imprisonment ended his life.

What cursed madnesse and impiety is this? a man to be so forgetfull of his Maker and himselfe, that he preferred his whores before his Saviour, and his filthy pleasure before the grace of God?

But when they had thus pampered their desires together a while, in came the devill, and would needs conclude the play: for as they were banquetting with many such like companions, he tooke her away from the Priests side, and notwithstanding her pittifull crying and all their exorcising and conjuring, carried her quite away, telling the Priest that very shortly he would, fetch him also, for he was his owne darling.</p>
               <p>I may not here passe over in silence an Irish history, famous both for <note place="margin">Holinshed.</note> notorious villany, and excellent in justice; wherein we may see by the adultery of one filthy Fryer occasion given not only of much bloodshed, but of the ruine of a famous City, called Rosse, scituate in Leinster. This City being first an unwalled towne, was (to prevent the sudden invasion of the Irish) compassed about with a large and strong wall, by the advice and charges of one <hi>Rose,</hi> a chaste widdow and bountifull Gentlewoman: This <hi>Rose</hi> had issue three sons, who being bolstered out by their mothers wealth and their owne traffique, made divers prosperous voyages into far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: but as one of the three chapmen was employed in his traffique abroad, so the pretty poppet his wise began to play the harlot at home, and that with none but a fat religious cloysterer of the towne: they wallowed so long in this stinking puddle, that suspition began to creepe into mens braines, and from suspition the matter was so apparent, that it grew to plaine proofe: her unfortunate husband was no sooner come home, but notice hereof was blowne in his eares, so that with griefe and anger he grew (for such is the nature of jealous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59545:127"/>
the whole towne took themselves as extreamely wronged by this shamefull fact: whereupon divers of them conspiring together, agreed (as being a deed of charity) to grub away such wilde shrubs from the towne, and so flocking together in the dead of the night to the Abbey, wherein this Fryet was cloystered (the monument of which Abbey is yet to be seen at Rosse on the South side) they undersparred the gates, and breaking open the doores, stabbed the Adulterer, with the rest of the Covent, through with their weapons; where they left them goaring in their blood, and gasping up their ghosts in their couches: a cruell act, I must needs confesse, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners; who being carried away with private revenge, had no measure in their cruelty; but yet a just vengeance upon the executed, that harboured and maintained so wretched a person: but secret and deep are the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, who punisheth one sin with another, and maketh one wicked man a rod to plague another, and after casteth the rod also into the fire: for so did he here; stirring up the rest of the Clergy to be a meanes to punish this cruelty: for when as these three brethren not long after sped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into some far countrey to continue their trade, the religious men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed of their returne homeward, every night did not misse to set a lantorne on the top of a high rock (which was used to be set upon the Hulk tower, a notable marke for Pilots, in directing them which way to sterne their Ships, and to eschew the danger of the rockes, which are there very plentifull) and so by this practise these three passengers bearing saile with a good winde, made right upon the lantorne, supposing it had been the Hulk tower, and so ere they were aware their Ship was dasht upon the rockes, and all the passengers over-whirled in the Sea. And thus was Adultery pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with cruelty, and cruelty with treason: but see the end; upon this there grew so great quarrels and discontentments between the townesmen and the religious, the one cursing the other, that the estate of that flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towne was turned upside downe, and from abundance of prosperity, quite exchanged to extreame penury.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot passe over in silence a history truly tragicall, touching the death of many men, who by reason of an Adultery slew one another in most strange and cruell manner, and indeed so strangely, that (as far as I ever read or knew) there was never the like particular deed heard of, wherein God more evidently poured forth the streame of his displeasure, turning the courage and valour of each part into rage and fury, to the end that by their owne meanes he might be revenged on them. In the Dukedome of Spaleto, which is the way from Ancona to Rome (of the antient Latines called Umbria) there were three brethren, who kept in their possession three Cities of the said Dukedome, namely Faligno, Nocera, and Trevio: the eldest of whom, whose sirname was <hi>Nicholas,</hi> as he passed from one town
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59545:127"/>
to the other, being at Nocera, lodged divers times in the Castle in the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Captaines house, whom he had there substituted to defend the place with an ordinary band of souldiers. Now as he made his abode there a few dayes, he grew to cast a more lascivious eye upon the Captaines wife than was meet, and from looking fell to lusting after her; in such sort, that in short space he got very privy and familiar acquaintance with her, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times secret and suspitious meetings: which being perceived by her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, he after watched so narrowly their haunts, that once he spyed them together without being seen of them: neverthelesse, digesting and swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up this sorrow with silence, and without giving forth any tokens there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he consulted in himselfe to revenge the injury by the death and rasing out, not only of the Adulterer, but also of the whole race and fraternity. Now when he had hampered this enterprise, and layed forth the plot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in his head, he dispatched presently a messenger to the three Gentlemen brethren, to invite them against the next day to the hunting of the fairest wilde Bore that was this many a day seen in the forrests of Nocera. Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or <hi>Nicholas</hi> failed not to come at the time appointed, accompanied with Duke <hi>Camerino,</hi> who desired to be one of this jolly crue: they supped in the towne, but lodged in the castle, where being at rest, about midnight the Captaine rushed into his chamber with the greatest part of his guard, and there handled Seignior <hi>Nicholas</hi> on this manner; he first cut off his privy members, as being principall in the offence, then thrust him through on both sides with a speare, next pluckt out his heart, and lastly, tore the rest of his body into a thousand pieces. As for the Duke <hi>Camerino,</hi> he shut him up in a deep and dark dungeon with all the strangers of his retinue. At day breake another of the brethren called <hi>Caesar,</hi> that lay that night in the town, was sent for to come and speake with his brother, and as soone as he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the Court of the Castle, seven or eight of the guard bound him and his followers, and carried him into the chamber where his dead brother lay chopt as small as flesh to the pot, and there murdered him also. <hi>Conrade</hi> the third brother, being by reason of a Marriage absent from this feast, when he received the report of these pittifull news, gathered together a band of men from all quarters, and with them (assisted with the friends and allies of the Duke <hi>Camerino</hi> then prisoner) layed siege to the Castle, they battered the walls, made a breach, and gave the assault of enterance, and were man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully resisted five houres long, till the defendants being but thirty or forty men at the most, not able to stand any longer in defence, were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and lay open way of enterance to the enemy: then began a most horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble butchery of men; for <hi>Conrade,</hi> having woon the fort, first hewed them in pieces that stood in resistance, then finding the Captaines father, slew him, and cast him piece-meale to the dogs; some he tyed to the tailes of wilde horses, to be drawne over hedges, ditches, thornes, and bryers; others he pinched with hot Irons, and so burnt them to death: which when the Captaine from the top of the dungeon where he had saved himselfe, beheld, he tooke his wife whom he held there prisoner, and binding her hand and foot, threw her headlong from the top of the tower upon the pavement: which the souldiers perceiving, put fire to the tower, so that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained through heat and smoke (himselfe, his brother, and his little child) to sally downe the same way which he had taught his wife a little before to goe, and so all three broke their necks: their carkasses were cast out to bee
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59545:128"/>
meat for Wolves, as unworthy of humane sepulture. And this was the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastrophe of that wofull tragedy, where by the occasion of one Adultery (so heavy is the curse of God upon that sin) a number of men came to their ends.</p>
               <p>In the histories of our time we finde recorded a fearefull story of many murders springing from one Adultery, together with the hand of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Adulterers themselves; the story is this: an Advocate of Grasse in Provence, called <hi>Tolonio,</hi> that having the managing of the affaires of the Seignior of Chabrye, and by that meanes familiar accesse to him and his Lady, by this familiarity allured the Lady, who was then forty yeares old, and had foure children, to his filthy lust: and being plunged into this gulfe, Satan did thrust them headlong into others: for first they practised and performed the massacre of her husband, walking in his Warren, by two murderers suborned to that end: and secondly, when her eldest sonne seemed to dislike her wicked behaviour with the Advocate, they also wrought his death, by loosing certaine boords in a gallery, where he used ordinarily to walk, so that as soone as he set his foot on these disjoynted boords, he fell downe headlong, and had his braines beaten out. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when her younger son shewed his discontent to their brutish conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet nothing misdoubted them to be guilty of the former parricides, these wicked wretches resolved to prevent him also, lest he should interrupt their resolved filthinesse. Wherefore they hired a murderer to make him away; who watching his opportunity, thrust him headlong downe a steep rock, so that he was at the bottome sooner slaine then he felt the murderer. After all this, these two miserable wretches, finding that they were obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by all men, and noted, did practise to marry together: but there was one betwixt them, namely the Advocates wife; wherefore they conspired her death to make up the messe, and indeed the villanous lecher, her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, lying one night by her, strangled her with a napkin; and then cryed out with a loud voice for help, pretending that a catarre had suffocated her in her sleep. But for all his cunning, the father of his wife mistrusted her death to be violent, and caused him to be strictly examined upon the same; who presently by silence bewrayed his guilty conscience, and after without torture confessed both his fact, and all the murders before mentioned: for which he was condemned to be quartered alive in the market place of Grasse, where he dwelled, and where his murders were committed. As for that cruell Lady his associate, because she could not be found, being fled the countrey, she was condemned by contempt, and executed in picture. But though she escaped the hand of justice among men, yet the hand of God pursued her: for flying to Genoa, she was first robbed by a servant of all she had, and after being constrained to serve an olde widdow, and to teach her daughters, being tormented with the sting of her owne conscience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in short space dyed in great misery.</p>
               <p>In the time of Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> the eighth, there was a varlet Priest that was Chaplaine in the house of a Marquesse of Italie, who although he was very <note place="margin">

If it be a sin to take away, ravish, or intice to folly another mans wife, shall we not thinke it an equall sin for a husband to forsake his wife, and cast her off to take another, she having not disanulled and cancelled the bond of marriage by adultery?

But what got he by it? Marry this; the Philistims provoked against him, consumed him and his daughter with fire, because that by the meanes of his injury <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> had burned their corne, their vineyards and their olive-trees.</p>
               <p>After the same sort dealt <hi>Saul</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> when he gave him his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.</note>

No verily, no though they be Popes that take it upon them: as we reade Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixth did, who for the advancement of his haughty desires, to gratifie and flatter, <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, King of France, sent him by his son a dispensation to put away his Wife, daughter to King <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, because she was barren and counterfeit, and to recontract <hi>Anne</hi> of Bretaigne, the widow of <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth lately deceased. But herein, though barrennesse of the former was pretended, yet the Duchie of the later was aimed at, which before this time he could never attain unto. But of what force and vertue this dispensation by right was, or at least ought to be, it is easie to perceive, seeing it is not onely contrary to the words of the Gospel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. but also to their owne decrees, <hi>secund. part. quest.</hi> 7. <hi>Hi qui matrimonium:</hi> where in is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that marriage ought not to be infringed for any default or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, no not of nature.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough Incest be a wicked and abominable sin, and forbidden both by the Law of God and man, in so much that the very heathen held it in detestation, yet are there some so inordinately vicious and dissolute, that they blush not once to pollute themselves with this filthinesse, <hi>Reuben</hi> the Patriarch was one of this <note place="margin">Gen. 35.</note> vile crue, that shamed not to defile himselfe with <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha</hi> his fathers concubine; but he was cursed for his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: for whereas by right of eldership and birth he ought to have had a certain prerogative and authority over his brethren, his excellency shed it selfe <note place="margin">Gen. 49.</note> like water, and he was surpassed by his brethren both in encrease of progeny and renowne. <hi>Ammon</hi> one of King <hi>Davids</hi> sonnes was so strongly <note place="margin">2 Sam. 13.</note> enchanted with the love of his sister <hi>Thamar,</hi> that to the end to fulfill his lust, he traiterously forced her to his will: but <hi>Absalom</hi> her naturall brother (hunting for opportunity of revenge for this indignity towards his sister) <note place="margin">Rape. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 21.</note> invited him two yeares after to a banquet with his other brethren, and after the same, caused his men to murder him for a farewell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:59545:130"/>
The same <hi>Absalom</hi> that slew <hi>Amnon</hi> for Incest with his sister, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himselfe incest with his fathers concubines, moved thereto by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.</note> counsell of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> that advised him to that infamous deed of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his fathers bed: but it was the forerunner of his overthrow, as we have already heard.</p>
               <p>Divers of the Roman Empetours were so villanous and wretched, as to <note place="margin">Suct. Lamprid.</note> make no bones of this sin with their owne sisters, as <hi>Caligula, Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Commodus:</hi> and some with their mothers, as <hi>Nero,</hi> so much was he given over and transported to all licentiousnesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> telleth us of one <hi>Cyanippus,</hi> that being overcome with wine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floured <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Oros. l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> his owne daughter <hi>Cyane,</hi> but he was slain of her for his labour. Neither do I thinke it so unnaturall a part for her to kill her father, as in him to commit incest with his owne daughter: for the Oracle lessened, or rather approved her fault, when it abhorred and chastened his crime: for when Syracusa was grievously infected with the pestilence, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the Oracle, That the plague should continue till the wicked person was sacrificed: which dark speech when no man knew, <hi>Cyane</hi> haled her father by the head to the Altar; telling them, that he was that wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son pointed at by the Oracle, and there sacrificed him with her owne hands, killing her selfe also with the same knife, that her innocency might be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed even by her bloud. Thus it pleased God even among the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous heathen, to execute justice and judgement upon the earth, though by the meanes of the devill himselfe, who is the authour of all such villany.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valeria Thusculana</hi> was in love with her owne father, and under colour of another maid got to lie with him: which as soon as he understood, he slew <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> himselfe in detestation of his owne ignorant abhomination and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: nay, so monstrous and horrible is this sin, even in the sight of man, that <hi>Nausimenes</hi> (a woman of Athens) taking her owne son and daughter toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">Valerius.</note> was so amazed and grieved therewith, that she never spake word after that time, but remained dumbe all the rest of her life time: as for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors themselves, they lived not, but became murderers of their owne lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Papyrius</hi> a Roman, got with childe his owne sister <hi>Canusia:</hi> which when their father understood, he sent each of them a sword, wherewith they slew themselves.</p>
               <p>But above all, the vengeance of God is most apparent in the punishment <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zodar. lib.</hi> 3.</note> of <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperour, who to his notorious wickednesses, heresies, persecutions, and paganisme, he added this villany, to defile carnally his <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Paul. Diac. l.</hi> 18</note> owne sister; so to his notorious punishments (the Sarasins sword, dropsie, and the ruine of the Empire) the Lord added this infamous and cruell judgement, that he could not give passage to his urine, but it would flie into his face, had not a pentise been applied to his belly to beat it downeward. And this last plague was proper to his last sin; wherein the very member which he had abused, sought revenge of him that had abused it; for that he had confounded nature, and most wickedly sinned against his owne flesh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agathias</hi> writing of the manners of the Persians, reporteth, That cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <note place="margin">Agathias.</note> Philosophers comming out of Aegypt into Greece, where they had seen all manner of unnaturall mixtures, found the carkase of a man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sepulchre; which when in charity they buried, the next day it was found unburied again: and as they went about to bury it the second time, a spirit appeared unto them, and forbad them to do it; saying, that it was unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59545:131"/>
that honour, seeing that when it lived he had committed incest with his owne mother. A notable story, shewing that the very earth abhorreth this monstrous confusion of nature: the truth whereof let it lie upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors credit.</p>
               <p>Most abominable was the incest of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> King of Persia; for first he tooke to himselfe <hi>Aspasia</hi> his brother <hi>Cyrus</hi> concubine, having overcome <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Herodot. lib.</hi> 9.</note> him in war; and afterward gave the same <hi>Aspasia</hi> to his owne son <hi>Darius</hi> to wife; from whom, after carnall knowledge, he tooke her againe, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting incest upon incest, and that most unnaturally: but mark how the Lord punished all this; first, <hi>Darius</hi> his eldest son was put to death for treason; then <hi>Othus</hi> (succeeding in the inheritance) slew <hi>Arsame</hi> another of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and albeit <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> himselfe dyed without note of judgement, yet his seed after him was punished for his offence; for so miserable a calamity pursued them all, that in the second generation not one was left to sit upon his throne.</p>
               <p>Now to teach us how execrable and monstrous this kinde of sin is, and how much to be abhorred of all men, the example of a bruit beast may stand in stead of a lesson for us; it being so worthy of remembrance, that I thought meet to make rehearsall of it in this place. It is reported by <hi>Varro</hi>

Truly a miraculous thing, and no doubt divinely caused, to reprove the enormous and too unruly lusts of men.</p>

               <p>Such like was the impudent lasciviousnesse of two unworthy Emperors, <hi>Commodus</hi> and <hi>Heliogabolus,</hi> who laying aside all Imperiall gravity, shewed <note place="margin">Lamprid.</note> themselves oftentimes publikely in womans attire; an act as in nature monstrous, so very dishonest and ignominious: but like as these cursed monsters ran too much out of frame in their unbridled lusts and affections,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59545:131"/>
so there wanted not many that hastened and emboldened themselves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire their destruction, as unworthy in their judgements to enjoy the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of this light: wherefore to one of them poison was ministred, and when that would take no effect, strangling came in the roome thereof, and brought him to his end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other was slaine in a jakes where he hid himselfe, and his body (drawne like carrion through the streetes) found no better sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre then the dunghill.</p>
               <p>Touching those abominable wretches of Sodome and Gomorrah which <note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> gave themselves over with all violence, and without all shame and measure, to their infamous lusts, polluting their bodies with unnaturall sins, God sent upon them an unnaturall raine, not of water, but of fire and brimstone, to burne and consume them, that were so hot and fervent in their cursed vices: so that they were quite rooted and raked out of the earth, and their Cities and habitations destroyed, yea and the very soile that bore them, made desolate and fruitlesse; and all this by fire, whose smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace: yea and in signe of a further curse for to be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and a marke of this terrible judgement, the earth and face of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey continueth still parched and withered: and (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith) whereas before it was a most plentifull and fertile soile, and as it were an earthly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, bedecked with five gallant Cities; now it lyeth desart, unhabitable, and barren, yeelding fruit in shew, but such as being touched, turneth to cinders. In a word, the wrath of God is so notoriously and fearefully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested therein, that when the holy Ghost would strike a terrour into the most wicked, he threateneth them with this like punishment, saying:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>The Lord will raine upon each wicked one, <note place="margin">Psal. 11. 6.</note> Fire, snares, and brimstone, for their portion.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Howbeit this maketh not but that still there are too many such monsters in the World, so mightily is it corrupted and depraved: neither is it any marvell, seeing that divers Bishops of Rome, that take upon them to be Christs Vicars, and <hi>Peters</hi> successours, are infected with this filthy conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: As namely, Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, whose custome was to promote none to Ecclesiasticall livings save only his buggerers: Amongst whom was one <hi>Innocent,</hi> whom this holy father (contrary to the Suffrages of the whole Colledge) would needs make Cardinall: nay, the unsatiable and monstrous lust of this beastly and stinking goat was so extraordinary, that he could not abstaine from many Cardinals themselves. <hi>Iohn de la Casae,</hi> a Florentine by birth, and by office Archbishop of Benevento, and Deane of his Apostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call chamber, was his Legat and Intelligencer in all the Venetian Seignio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a man equall, or rather worse then himselfe; and such a one, as whose memory ought to be accursed of all posterity, for that detestable booke which he composed in commendation and praise of Sodomie; and was so shamelesse, nay rather possessed with some devillish and uncleane spirit, as to divulgate it to the view of the world. Here you may see (poore soules) the holinesse of those whom you so much reverence, and upon whom you build your beliefe and religion: you see their brave and excellent vertues, and of what esteeme their lawes and ordinances ought to be amongst you. Now touching the end that this holy father made, it is declared in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer booke among the ranke of Atheists, where we placed him. And albeit

that he and such like villaines please their owne humours with their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and approve and cleare themselves therein, yet are they reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by death, not only by the law of God, but also by the law of <hi>Iulia.</hi>

               <p>When <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> reigned in France, there happened a most notable judgement of God upon the Monkes of S. <hi>Martin</hi> in Tours, for their disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate lusts: they were men whose food was too much and dainty, whose case was too easie, and whose pleasures were too immoderate, being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addicted to pastimes and merriments: in their apparell they went clad in silke like great Lords; and (as <hi>Nichol.

                     <hi>Nic. Gil. Vol.</hi> 1.</note> French Chronicles saith) their shooes were gilt over with Gold, so great was the super fluity of their riches and pride: in summe, their whole life was luxurious and infamous: for which cause there came forth a destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angel from the Lord (by the report of <hi>Budes</hi> the Abbot of Clugnie) and slew them all in one night, as the first born of Aegypt were slaine, save one only person that was preserved, as <hi>Lot</hi> in Sodome was preserved. This strange accident moved <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> to appoint a brotherhood of Canons to be in their roome, though little better, and as little profitable to their Commonwealth as the former.</p>
               <p>It is not for nothing that the law of God forbiddeth to lie with a beast, and denounceth death against them that commit this foule sin: for there have been such monsters in the world at some times, as we reade in <hi>Calius</hi>

From hence it was, that <hi>Pompey</hi> caused one of his souldiers <note place="margin">Sabel.</note> eyes to be put out in Spaine, for thrusting his hand under a womans gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was a Spaniard: and for the same or like offence did <hi>Sertorius</hi>

command a footman of his band to be cut in pieces. O that we had in these daies such minded captaines, that would sharply represse the wrongs and ravishments which are so common and usuall amongst men of war at this day, and so uncontrolled! they would not then doubtlesse be so rise and common as in these daies they are.</p>
               <p>Kissing is no lesse to be eschewed than the former, if it be not betwixt those that are tyed together by some bond of kindred or affinity, as it was by antient custome of the Medes and Persians, and Romanes also; according to the report of <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Seneca:</hi> and that which is more, <hi>Tiberius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> forbad the often and daily practise thereof in that kinde, as a thing not <note place="margin">Suet.</note> to be freqented, but rather utterly abhorred, though it be amongst kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes themselves. It was esteemed an indignity among the Graecians, to kisse any maid that was not in blood or assinity allyed unto them; as it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly appeareth by the earnest suit and request of the wife of <hi>Pisistratus</hi> the Tyran of Athens, to put to death a young man for kissing her daughter in <note place="margin">Valer. li. 1. c. 5.</note> the streets, as he met her, although it was nothing but love that moved him thereto. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> also affirmeth, That he which wantonly kisseth a <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De civitat. Dei lib.</hi> 21. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note> woman that is not his wife, deserveth the whip. It is true, that the holy Scripture often mentioneth kissing, but either betwixt father and childe, or brethren or kinsfolkes, or at least in a manner of salutation betwixt one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 45.</note> of acquaintance, according to the custome of the people of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <note place="margin">2 Sam. 20. 9.</note> sometimes also it is mentioned as a token of honour and reverence, which the subject performeth to his superiour in this action. In the former ages <note place="margin">1 Sam. 10.</note> Christians used to kisse also; but so, that it was ever betwixt parties of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; and in such sort, that by this manner of greeting they testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to each other their true and sincere charity, peace, and union of heart and soule in the Lord. Such chearings and loving embracings were pure and <note place="margin">Iust. Apolog. 2. Tertull.</note> holy, not lascivious and wanton, like the kisses of prophane and leacherous wretches and strumpets, whereof <hi>Solomon</hi> maketh mention.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, every man ought to shun all meanes and occasions which <note place="margin">Prov. 7. 13.</note> may induce or entice them to uncleanenesse; and amongst the rest especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Idlenesse, which cannot chuse but be as it were a wide doore and passage for many vices to enter by, as by experience we see in those that occupy themselves about no good nor profitable exercises, but mispend their time in trifling and doing nothing, and their wits either upon vaine and foolish conceit to the hurt of others; or upon lascivious and unchaste thoughts, to their owne overthrow; whereas on the contrary, to them that are well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed either in body or minde, no such thing betideth; wherefore wee ought to be here advertised every one of us to apply our selves to some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and seemly trade, answerable to our divers and severall estates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and not to suffer our selves to be overgrowne with Idlenesse, lest thereby we fall into mischiefe; for whom the adversary (that malicious and wicked one) findeth in that case, he knowes well how to fit them to his purpose, and to set them about filthy and pernitious services.</p>
               <p>Next to idlenesse, the too much pampering the body with dainty and much food is to be eschewed: for like as a fat and well fed horse winceth and kicketh against his rider, so the pampered flesh rebelleth against God and a mans owne selfe.

               <p>In our memory there was a Priest in Rovergne, neare Milan, that (dining with a rich farmer for his yeares dinner) cheared himselfe so well, and filled his belly so full, that it burst in two, and he dyed suddenly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> the great having invited many of his favourites and captaines to supper, propounded a crowne in reward to him that should drinke most: <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> now the greatest drinker swallowed up foure steanes of wine, and woon the prize, being in value worth six hundred crownes; but lost his life (a jewell of greater worth) for he survived not three daies after the vile excesse: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the rest that strove with him in this goodly conflict of carousing, one and forty of them dyed to beare him company.</p>
               <p>The same <hi>Alexander</hi> was himselfe subject to wine, and so distempered divers times therewith, that he often slew his friends at the table in his drunkennesse, whom in sobriety he loved dearest.</p>

heard, and almost incredible to be beleeved: he loved wine so well, that in stead of <hi>Tiberius</hi> they called him <hi>Biberius,</hi> and in stead of <hi>Claudius, Caldus,</hi> and in stead of <hi>Nero, Mero;</hi> noting by those nicknames, how great a drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard he was.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Philostrates,</hi> being in the bathes at Sinuessa, devoured so much wine, that he fell downe the staires, and almost broke his neck with the fall. <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Zeno,</hi> the Emperour of the East, was so notoriously given to excesse of meates and drinkes, that his sences being benummed, he would often lie as <note place="margin">Platina.</note> one that was dead: wherefore being become odious to all men by his beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualities, his wife <hi>Ariadne</hi> fell also in detestation of him, and one day as he lay sencelesse, she transported him into a tombe, and throwing a great stone upon it, pined him to death, not suffering any to remove the stone, or to yeeld him any succour; and this was a just reward of his drunkennesse.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Paulus</hi> the second, beside the exceeding pompe of apparell which he used, he was also very carefull for his throat: for (as <hi>Platina</hi> writeth of him) he delighted in all kinde of exquisite dishes, and delicate wine, and that in superfluity: by which immoderate and continuall surfeiting he fell into a grievous Apoplexy, which quickly made an end of his life. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of him, that he eat the day before he dyed two great Melons, and that in a very good appetite; when as the next night the Lord struck him with his heavy judgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> the son of <hi>Basilius,</hi> and brother of <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperour, did so wallow and drowne himselfe in the gulfe of pleasure and intemperance, that <note place="margin">

               <p>The moderne examples of Gods fearefull judgements upon drunkards, not only in other countries, but even in this Nation of ours, are many and terrible: all which if I should stand to report, it would be matter for a whole booke. Our reverend Judges in their severall circuits doe finde by experience, that few murthers and manslaughters are committed, which are not from this root of drunkennesse: for when mens braines are heat with wine and strong drinke, then their tongues are let loose to opprobrious speeches, and thence proceed both sudden quarrels, and deliberate chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges, wherewith thousands are brought to their untimely ends: Besides, the Lord punisheth the Drunkard many waies; first, in his soule, with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency and hardnesse of heart: which commonly followeth this vice: for

And lastly, with sudden death and destruction, even in the middest of their drunken fits, as wofull experience doth make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest every day, and almost in every corner of this land. Within these few yeares, of mine owne knowledge, three not far from Huntington being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with drinke, perished by drowning; when being not able to rule their horses, they were carried by them into the maine streame, from whence they never came out alive againe, but left behinde them visible markes of Gods justice, for the terrour and example of others; and yet what sin is more commonly used and lesse feared than this.</p>
               <p>Concerning Dancing (the usuall dependants of feasts and good cheare) there is none of sound judgement that know not, that they are baits and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements to uncleanenesse, and as it were instruments of bawdrie: by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof they were alwaies condemned among men of honour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, whether Romanes or Greekes, and left for vile and base minded men to use. And this may appeare by the reproach that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> the Orator gave to <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedony and his Courtiers, in an Oration to the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, wherein he termed them common dancers, and such as shamed not as soone as they had glutted their bellies with meate, and their heads with wine, to fall scurrilously a dancing. As for the honourable Dames of Rome, truly we shall never reade that any of them accustomed themselves to dance, according to the report of <hi>Salust</hi> touching <hi>Sempronia,</hi> whom he judged to be too fine a dancer and singer to be honourable withall: as if these two could no more agree then fire and water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> in his apologie of <hi>Muraena</hi> rehearseth an objection of <hi>Cato</hi> against <note place="margin">Muraena.</note> his client, wherein he challenged him for dancing in Asia; which he maketh a matter of so great reproach, that not daring to maintain or excuse the fact, he flatly denyeth it; saying, <hi>That no sober and discreet man ever would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that fault, unlesse his sence and reason was bereft him. Plutarch</hi> also setting forth the vertues of women, putteth in this among the rest, that she ought to be no dancer: and speaking in another place to all others as well as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, biddeth them to repulse even their friends, if they should lead and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice them to that exercise.</p>
               <p>Besides, all the ancient Doctors of the Church have utterly condemned them as unlawfull: <hi>Thou learnest to sing prophane and idle songs</hi> (saith <hi>Basil</hi>) and forgettest the godly Psalmes and Hymnes which were enact <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Is it the denying of a mans selfe? The spirituall regeneration? The putting off the old man touching our conversation in this life? And if all adultery <note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 4.</note> and uncleanenesse, all filthinesse and foolish talking, jesting and such like, ought not once to be named amongst us, because they are things not come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: If I say it be not lawfull to jeast or speake the least lascivious word that is, how shall it be lawfull to doe an action with the motion and consent of the whole body, which representeth nothing else but folly, vanity, and lasciviousnesse? And this is for them that demand where dancing is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the Scripture; which I touch as it were by the way, and doe but point at, not minding to frame any long discourse thereof, seeing there is a particular treatise touching the same matter, which he may reade that desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to know any more touching it. Now let us see what goodly fruits and commodities have risen therefrom. The daughters of the children of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el being dancing in Silo upon a festivall day, after the manner of the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised Idolaters, were ravished by the Benjamites for to be their wives, and that mixtly without regard of one or other, were they of never so high or base condition. <note place="margin">Judg. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At the feast which <hi>Herod</hi> the Tetrarch made to the Princes and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Nobles of Galilee, the daughter of <hi>Herodias</hi> pleased him and his company so well with her dancing, that to gratifie this filthy strumpet the incestuous Tyran caused <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to be beheaded. <note place="margin">Mark. 6.</note>

                  <hi>Lodowicke,</hi> Archbishop of Magdeburge, celebrating a solemne feast at a towne called Calven, invited many of the worthy Citizens to make merry with him: the place for their joyalty was the great hall wherein judiciall causes were appointed to be discussed. Here after the banquet ended they fell a dancing, men and women mixtly together, such a ridiculous roundelay, and such a multitude, that what with the weight of their bodies, or rather the indignation of God against them for this scurrilous and immodest beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the beames of the house began to crack and threaten a certain ruine; whereat the Archbishop affrighted, caught hold by a faire dame, and began first to goe downe the staires; but the steps afore loosened, as soone as he trode upon them, tumbled downe, and he and his consort headlong withall, and were crushed in pieces. And thus he that was principall of the feast and sport, was made an example to all the rest, of the Lords vengeance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he dishonoured his calling and profession by such lewd and light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour:
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59545:135"/>
and this was one goodly effect of dauncing.</p>
               <p>Another we reade of in the Chronicles of the same City to this effect, <note place="margin">Chron. Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</note> in a village called Ossemer, adjoyning to Stendell: As the Popish Priest played the minstrell to his parishioners that danced the morris before him, and rejoyced in their merry May-games, a tempest arose, and a thunderbolt struck off his night hand, together with the harpe which he played on, and consumed about twenty foure men and women of the company: a just pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of so prophane a Priest, who in stead of dehorting them (as his duty bound him) from that lascivious custome, played the chiefe part in their madnesse, and was an inticer of them unto it.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in many places, by dances grievous and spitefull quarrels have been stirred up, and many murders executed, the examples whereof are so evident and notorious, that it is not needfull now to stand upon them: to conclude therefore this point with the saying of <hi>Lodovicus Vives,</hi> There <note place="margin">Lodovicus Vives.</note> is not a greater vanity in the world than dancing; for (saith he) I heard of certain men of Asia, that comming into Spaine, when they first saw the Spaniards dance, were so sore affrighted, that they ran away for feare, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing them to have been either possessed with some spirit, or out of their wits at least: and truly I thinke if a man had never seen a woman dance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he could hardly be of another judgement, there being nothing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth frenzie and lunacy more than the strange shakings and motions of the body at the noise of a beaten sheep-skin: verily it is a pastime to mark the grave behaviour, the measurable march, the pomp and ostentation of women dancers, and the great care they have to performe wisely so foolish an action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is very likely that all their wit at that time is distilled from their head into their feet, for there it is more requisite and needfull than in their braine.

               <p>Cardinall <hi>Wolsey</hi> being determined to erect two new Colledges, one at <note place="margin">Stow. Chron.</note> Oxford, and the other at Ipswich, obtained licence and authority of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the seventh, to suppresse about the number of forty monasteries, to furnish and set forward the building of his said Colledge: which irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sacriledge (I call it sacriledge both because he was perswaded in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that those goods belonged to the Church, and so to him it was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge: as also for that he did it in pride of his heart) was furthered by five persons, who were the chiefe instruments of the dissolution of Daintry Monastery, because the Prior and Covent would not grant them certaine lands in farme at their owne price. But what punishment ensued upon them at Gods hand the world was witnesse of: for of these five persons, two fell at discord amongst themselves, and the one slew the other, for the which the survivor was hanged; the third drowned himselfe in a well; the fourth, being then worth two hundred pounds, within three yeares became so poore that he begged untill his dying day; and the fifth (called Doctor <hi>Allen)</hi> was cruelly maimed in Ireland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Cardinall himselfe falling into the Kings displeasure, was deposed from his bishoprick, and dyed miserably: the Colledges which he meant to have made so glorious a building, came never to any good effect, the one at Ipswich being cleane defaced, the other at Oxford unfinished.</p>
               <p>And thus much of sacriledge: Now let us come and see the punishment of simple theft, the principall cause whereof is covetousnesse; which is so unruly an evill, and so deep rooted in the heart of man, that ever yet it hath used to encroach upon the goods of others, and to keep possession of that which was none of its owne; breaking all the bonds of humanity, equity, and right, without being contained in any measure or meane; whereof wee have a most notable example in the old world before the flood, which (by <hi>Moses</hi> report) overflowed with iniquity and extortion, the mighty ones op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed the weak, the greater trode under foot the lesse, and the rich devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the poore. When the Lord saw the generall deluge of sin and disorder thus universally spread (which indeed was a signe of great defection and contempt of him) he like a just judge that could not endure these monstrous

iniquities, sent a deluge of waters amongst them, by opening the windowes of heaven, and breaking up the fountaines of the great deepes, and giving passage to the waters both by heaven and earth, so that it raigned forty daies, and forty nights without ceasing, and the waters prevailed upon the earth, and overcovered the high mountaines by fifteen cubites, the earth being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the same estate which it had in the beginning before the waters were tooke away from the face thereof: verily it was a most hideous and sad spectacle, to see first the vallies, then the hils, and last the highest moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines so overflowne with water, that no shew or appearance of them might be perceived; it was a dreadfull sight to behold whole houses, tossed to and fro up and downe in the waves, and at last to be shivered in pieces: there was not a City nor village that perished not in the deep, not a tree nor tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er so high that could overpeere the waters: as they increased more and more in abundance, so feare, horrour, and despaire of safety encreased in the heart of every living soule. And on this fashion did God punish those wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, not at one blow, but by little and little increasing their paine, that as they had a long time abused his patience, and made no reckoning of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so the punishment of their sin might be long and tedious. Now in this extremity one could not help another, nor one envy another, but all were concluded under the same destruction, all surprised, assieged, and envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned alike, as well he that roved in the fields, as he that stayed in the houses, he that climbed up into the mountaines, as he that abode in the vallies, the mercilesse waters spared none: it was to no purpose that some ascended their high houses, some climbed upon trees, and some scaled the rockes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one nor other found any refuge or safety in any place, the rich were not saved by their riches, nor the strong by the pith of their strength, but all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished and were drowned together, except <hi>Noah</hi> and his family: which pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment was correspondent unto the worlds iniquity, for as the earth was corrupted and polluted with abundance of sin, so God sent abundance of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to purge and cleanse away the filthinesse thereof, as at the latter day hee will send fire to purifie and refine heaven and earth from their dregs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store them to their first and purest estate. And thus God revenged the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion and cruelty of that age.</p>
               <p>But yet for all this, those sins were not then so defaced and rooted up, but that they be burnished againe and growne in time to as big a bulke: for even at this day the greatest part of the world is given to practise fraud and deceit, and by unlawfull meanes to incroach upon others goods: which subtilties though they desire never so to disguise and cloke, yet will they ever be condemned and reputed kindes of theft before God: now as some are of greater power &amp; authority than others in the world, so answerable to themselves is the quality of their sins, and by consequence the punishment: the greater of power, the greater theeves, and the greater judgment; for if a poore man that through poverty and necessity cutteth a purse or stealeth any other trifle, be culpable, how much more culpable shall he that is rich be, that usurpeth the goods of his neighbour?</p>

Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is most unlawfull for them to exact that above measure upon their Commons, which being in mediocrity is not condemned: I say it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull both by the law of God and man (the Law of God and man is tearmed all that which both God and man allow and agree upon, and which a man with a safe conscience may put in practise:) for the former we can have no other schoolmaster nor instruction, save the holy Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath manifested his will unto us concerning this very matter; as in Deuteronomy the eighteenth, speaking of the office and duty of a King, he forbiddeth them to be hoorders up of gold and siluer, and espousers of many wives, and lovers of pride: signifying thereby, that they ought to contain themselves within the bounds of modesty and temperance, and not give the raines to their owne affections, nor heape up great treasures to their peoples detriment, nor to delight in war, nor to be too much subject to their owne pleasures: all which things are meanes of unmeasurable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: so that if it be not allowable to muster together multitudes of goods, for the danger and mischief that ensueth thereof, as it appeareth out of this place; then surely it is much lesse lawfull to levy excessive taxes of the people; for the one of these cannot be without the other: and thus for the Law of God it is clear, that by it authority is not committed unto them, to surcharge, and as it were trample downe their poor subjects, by unmeasurable and unsupportable impositions.</p>
               <p>As for that which the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> in the Name of God giveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Israelites of, touching the right of a King; wherein he seemeth to allow him the disposition of the goods and persons of his subjects: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer first, That God being an immoveable Truth, cannot contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by commanding and forbidding the same thing; and secondly, that the word of the Text in the Originall signifieth nothing else but a custome or fashion, as it appeareth by the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 13. besides, the speech that the Prophet useth, importeth not a commandment, but an advertisement

of the subjection, whereunto the people were about to thrust themselves, by desiring a King after the manner of other Nations, whose customes amongst them was to exercise authority and dominion as well over their goods as their persons: for which cause God would have them forewarned, that they might know how vile a yoak they put their owneneckes under, and what grievous and troublesome servitude they undertook, from the which they could no wayes be delivered, no though they de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Furthermore, that a King in Israel had no power (in right and eq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Hardiknitus</hi> King of Denmarke, after the death of <hi>Harold</hi> was ordained <note place="margin">The same.</note> King of England, in the year of our Lord 1041. This King as he was somewhat cruell (for he caused the body of <hi>Harold</hi> to be taken up out of the Sepulclire, and smiting off his head, to be cast out into the River Thames, because he had injured his mother <hi>Emma</hi> when he was alive;) so he was burdensom to his Subjects in tributes and exaction: for which cause grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into hatred with God and his Subjects, he was strucken with sudden death, not without suspition of poysoning, after he had raigned three yeares.</p>

                  <hi>William Rufus,</hi> second son of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, succeeded his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as in the Kingdom of England, so in disposition of nature: for they <note place="margin">The same.</note> were both cruell, inconstant, and covetous, aud burdened their people with unreasonable taxes; insomuch, that what by the murraine of men by postilence, and oppressions of them by exactions, the tillage of the earth was put off for one year, being the year 1099, whereby ensued great scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city the year following throughout all the Land: but for the oppression <hi>William</hi> was justly punished by sudden death, when being at his disport of hunting he was wounded with an arrow glauncing from the bow of <hi>Tyrill</hi> a French Knight, and so his tyranny and life ended together.</p>
               <p>And here is further to be noted, that the place where this King was slain, was called New Forest; in which same place <hi>Richard,</hi> the Cousin ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane of King <hi>William,</hi> son to Duke <hi>Robert</hi> his brother, was likewise slain. This New Forest was made by <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour their father, who plucked downe and depopulated divers Townes and Churches the compasse of 30. miles about, to make this a Forest for wilde Beasts: a most beastly sin, yea a bloudy crying sin, too too much practised in these dayes, and that by great persons, that make no conscience to turne Townes into pastures, and men into sheep: but let all them behold the just vengeance of God upon this Kings posterity: for when then either cannot or will not revenge, then God revengeth either in them or their posterity.</p>
               <p>In the year 1548. the Commons of Guyenne, Santonge, and Augoule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mois fell into a great Rebellion, by reason of the extortions of the Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers <note place="margin">Annales of France, <hi>Henry</hi> 2.</note> and Farmours of Salt: the Rebels in a few weekes grew to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fourty thousand men, armed with clubs and staves; who joyning with the Islanders, by a generall consent ran upon the Officers of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, and with extreme sury put to sword all that they could take, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the King of Navarre sought by all meanes to appease them. About the same time the Commons of Gascoigne rose in divers places, upon the same causes, and notwithstanding all that the Lord of Monneins, the Kings Lieutenant, and all other Officers could do, they made a great spoil of many honourable Houses, and massacre of much people: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that the Lord of Moneins himselfe was slain by them, whilest he was making an Oration to them to pacifie their rage: but at length these Rebels were suppressed by <hi>Francis</hi> of Lorraine, Earle of Aumale, and <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Mommorancye,</hi> high Constable of France, and the chief King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59545:143"/>

Thus the Lord punished both the one and the other, and the one by the other; the exactors for their oppression, and the tumultuous Commons for their Rebellion.</p>
               <p>Neither doth the Lord thus punish oppressours themselves, but also they that either countenance, or having authority, do not punish the same; as <note place="margin">Lanquet.</note> it appeareth by this example following. In the year of our Lord 475. there lived one <hi>Corrannus</hi> a King of Scots; who though he governed the people in peace and quietnesse a long space, and was indeed a good Prince, yet because his Chancellour <hi>Tomset</hi> used extortion and exaction amongst his Subjects, and he being advertised thereof, did not punish him, he was slain traiterously by his owne Subjects.</p>
               <p>It is not unworthy to be noted, how <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, prospered a long while in the warres against France, and got many worthy and wonderfull victories: but when Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> son unto the aforesaid <hi>Edward,</hi> after conditions of peace concluded, began to set taxes and impositions upon the Country of Aquitain, then did King <hi>Edwards</hi> part begin to incline, and the successe of war, which the space of fourty yeares never forsook him, now frowned upon him; so that he quickly lost all those lands which by composition of peace were granted unto him.</p>

               <p>Moreover, as the Babylonian Empire was overthrowne by <hi>Darius</hi> of Persia, so was his Persian Kingdome (in <hi>Darius</hi> the last King of that countrey his time, this mans successor) overturned by Alexander. Again, the great dominion of <hi>Alexander</hi> (who survived not long after) was not continued to any of his by inheritance, but divided like a prey amongst his greatest captaines, and from them the most part of it in short time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended to the Romanes; who spreading their wings, and stretching their greedie tallons farre and neere, for a while ravened and preyed over all the world, and enriched and bedecked themselves with the spoyles of many nations; and therefore it was necessary that they also should be made a prey, and that the farre fetcht Goths and Vandales should come upon them, as upon the bodie of a great Whale that suffers shipwreck upon the sea shore: since which time the Romane Empire went to decay, and grew eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day weaker than other; yea, and many Princes setting themselves against and above it, have robbed it of the realmes and provinces which it robbed others of before. And thus wee may see how all things run as it were in a circle, and how great the uncertainetie of this world is, seeing that the mightiest are subject to so many and great changes: for if there be any thing under the Sun that may carry any shew of stability or continuance, surely it is a Monarchie or Common-wealth, grounded upon the unitie and consent of all people, maintained by the authoritie of the greatest and most mightie, and underpropped with the shores of much strength and wealth, as the Romane Empire was; and yet for all that, there was never any, though never so well reared and furnished, and deepe rooted, which at the length hath not bin demolished, ransacked, and pulled up by some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and strange calamitie. And this is that which the spirit of God would give us to knowe, by the vision of that great image, represented to <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> in a dreame, according to <hi>Daniels</hi> interpretation thereof; to wit, that the foure great and puissant Monarchies of the world should at last be ruined and dispersed, like the chaffe before the winde, till they were consumed and brought to nothing, albeit they were glorious and excellent as gold and silver, or strong and mightie as brasse and iron.</p>
               <p>How much more foolish and evill advised are they then, that for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine apparant splendour and shew of worldly honour (which is as fraile as any rose, as variable as the winde, as light and vaine as a shadow or smoke, as unassured as a rotten planke) have the eyes of their minde so dazeled, and their wits so bewitched, and all their affections so transported, as to mingle heaven and earth together, to dash the East against the West, to stirre up discord and dissention betwixt man and man, and to shed so many thousand mens bloud, and all for a paltrie desire of reigne, though to their owne finall ruine and destruction.</p>

went about to usurpe a tyrannicall rule over the whole Seigniorie, and that by pride and threats, desiring rather to make himselfe terrible to the people by those bad meanes, than amiable and beloved by any meanes whatsoever; and thus daily hee grew as in age so in insolencie: he placed a garrison of men about his palace, and so fortifying himselfe, presently he shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his colours, namely a cruell Tyran: which when the multitude perceived, and remembred withall their libertie, which they were like to lose, they tooke up armes forthwith, in purpose to beat downe his haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie minde: therefore they first set on fire his house, and caused him to forsake his fortresse, and to betake himselfe to his shifts: but when by reason of the stopping of the passages he could not escape, they tooke him and his young sonne also which was with him, and put them to a most cruell and sudden death, and cast their carkasses to be devoured of dogs.</p>
               <p>In the Empire of <hi>Maximilian, Lewis Sforce,</hi> a Prince of an inconstant <note place="margin">

Of the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an historie.</note> and turbulent spirit, ambitious, and one that made no account of his promises nor faith, tooke upon him the governement of Milan, after the death of his brother <hi>Galeaz,</hi> Duke of Milan, who was traiterously slaine: in which action the first wrong which hee did was to his brothers widow, whom hee deposed; the second to his young nephew, his brother <hi>Galeaz</hi> son, whom he so brought up as if he never meant he should come to honour or goodnesse; for he suffered him not to be trained up either in learning or armes, but let him runne into all possible occasions that might corrupt and spoyle his tender age. Thus hee enjoyed the principalitie thirteene yeares, all the while under his nephewes reigne; to whom when <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of Naples had given in mariage one of his daughters, and perceived what small reckoning his uncle made of restoring him his Dukedome; after he had often and instantly intreated him without prevailing, at length he fell to threaten him with warre: he fearing to have the worse, and to lose so great a dignitie, wrought so by his owne shifts and devices, together with the helping hand of Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> that hee put in the head of <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth of France to go and conquer Naples, for the hatred which his heart possessed against <hi>Alphonsus;</hi> supposing by this meanes the better to accomplish his affaires to his owne desire. The King of France <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Guicciard. li.</hi> 1</note> was no sooner entred Italie, but <hi>Lewis Sforce</hi> ministred an Italian posset to his young nephew <hi>Iohn Galeaz,</hi> that hee immediatly died upon it, and then he proclamed himselfe Prince of the Duchie, by the aid of the principall of the Councell, whom he had woon to referre that honour unto him, by deposing the young sonne of <hi>Iohn Galeaz,</hi> beeing then but five yeares old: but he declared presently his inconstant and perfidious nature, in breaking promise with the King of France, whome he had induced with so many faire speeches to undertake that voyage, and entering a new league with the Venetians both against him and the Pope, although ere long he served them with the same measure: but <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, succeeding in the Crowne of France, could not brooke this injurie done to his predecessor, but preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a title to the Duchie of Milan, he dispatched an armie thitherward, that bestirred it selfe so well, that in short space they brought under their subjection all the Cities and Townes neere adjoyning: which the citizens perceiving, began to rebell against their Duke, and killed his Treasurer: whereupon he (being not able to make his part good with the French a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, nor daring to put any confidence in his owne at home) left his castle
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:59545:146"/>
to the charge and custodie of a captaine, and fled himselfe with his children to Almaine, towards the Emperour <hi>Maximilians</hi> court, hoping to finde succour at his hand, as indeed he did: for he returned to Milan with five hundred Burgundians, and eight thousand Switzers, and was received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the Citie. Being thus refortified with these and other more troupes that came unto him, he encamped before Navarre, and by compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition got the City into his hands from the Frenchmen. The French King in the meane while sent a new supplie of men into the Duchie, amongst whom were many Switzers, who so dealt with their countrimen that were on the Dukes side, that they brought them also to favour the King of France, and to forsake the Duke: which when he understood, hee presently departed the citie, and posting to the campe, hardened his souldiers, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to play the men, and not to shrinke, for he meant to give battell without delay: but the captains made answer, that they might not fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their owne nation, without especiall leave from their Lords. Now in the meane while, whilest these things were in doing, they tooke order, that the Frenchmen should approach to Navarre, and intercept all the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, that the Duke might not escape: He therefore laid aside his horse, and marched on foot in the squadron of Switzers, now joyned to the French, in attire and armour like a Switzer, thinking by this tricke to save his life: but all his counterfeiting could not save him from being taken, and from lying ten yeares prisoner in the Tower of Loches, where he also died: and so all his high and ambitious thoughts (which scarcely Italie could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine) were pend up in a strait and narrow roome. <note place="margin">

               <p>With the like turbulent and furious spirit of ambition have many Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bishops been inspired, who what by their jugling trickes, cousenages, and subtill devises, and what by force, have prospered so well, that of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Bishops (which they were wont to be) they are growne temporall Lords, and as it were Monarchs; having in their possessions lands, cities, castles, fortresses, havens, garrisons, and guards, after the manner of Kings; nay they have exalted themselves above Kings (so intollerable is <note place="margin">Marke 10. Luke 22.</note> their impudence) and made them subject to their wils; and yet they call themselves the Apostles pedigree, whom Christ forbad all such dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But what of that? It pertaineth not to them to succeed in vertue, but in authoritie the Apostles: for if that charge had concerned them, then Pope <hi>Lucius</hi> the second would never have beene so shamelesse, as to request <note place="margin">Bal.</note> in right of his Popeship the soveraigntie over Rome as hee did: neither when it was denyed him, to have gone about to usurpe it by force, and to bring his minde about to have layed siege to the Senat house with armed men, to the end that either by banishing or murdering the Senatours then assembled together, he might invest himselfe with the Kingly dignitie: but what got he by it? Marry this, the people being in an uprore in the Citie, upon the sight of this holy fathers proud attempt, tooke themselves to armes, and ran with such violence upon master Pope, that they forthwith stoned his Holinesse to death; but not like <hi>Stephen</hi> the Martyr for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Christ Iesus, but like a vile and seditious theefe for seeking the Common-wealths overthrow.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourteenth, a monkes sonne, succeeding <hi>Lucius</hi> both in the Papacie, and also in ambition, tooke in hand his omitted enterprises; <note place="margin">Sabel. Bal.</note> for he excommunicated the Romanes, untill they had banished <hi>Arnold</hi> a
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:59545:146"/>
Bishop, that gave them counsell to retaine the power of electing their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, and governing their citie in their hands (a thing repugnant to his intent) and after hee had degraded the Consuls, to make his part the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he caused the Emperour <hi>Fredericke</hi> to come with an armie to the citie; whom notwithstanding hee handled but basely for his paines: for hee did not onely checke him openly for standing on his feet, and holding the stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop of his horse with his left hand, but also denied him the crowne of the Empire, except hee would restore to him Poville, which (he said) pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto him: how beit he got the Crowne notwithstanding, and before his returne from Rome into Germanie, more than a thousand citizens that would not yeeld nor subscribe unto the Popes will, were slaine. After <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derickes</hi> departure, the Pope seeing himselfe destitute of his further aid, first excommunicated the King of Sicilie, that in right of inheritance possessed the foresaid Poville: but when this served him to small purpose, he practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with <hi>Emanuel</hi> the Emperour of Greece to set upon him; which thing turned to his finall confusion. After this (through his intollerable pride) hee fell out with <hi>Fredericke</hi> the Emperour, and to revenge himselfe upon him, discharged his subjects from their fealtie to him, and him from his authoritie over them. Now marke his end: As he walked one day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Aviane, a flie got in at his mouth and downe his throat so farre, that it stopped the conduit of his breath, so that for all that his physitions could do, hee was choked therewith. And thus he that sought by all the meanes he could to make himselfe greater than he ought to be, and to get the masterie of every thing at his owne will and pleasure, and to take away other mens rights by force, was cut short and rebated by a small and base creature, and constrained to leave this life, which he was most unworthy of.</p>
               <p>Hither may be referred that which befell the Emperour <hi>Albert,</hi> Duke of Austria, and one of his lievtenants in Switzerland, for going about to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpe and appropriat certaine lands and dominions to him, which belonged not unto him. This Emperour had many children whom he desired to leave rich and mighty, and therefore by all meanes possible he endeavoured to augment his living, even by getting from other men whatsoever he could; and amongst all the rest, this was one especiall practise, wherein he laboured tooth and nayle to alienate from the Empire the land of the Switzers, and to leave it for an everlasting inheritance to his heires: which although the Switzers would in no case condiscend nor agree unto, but contrariwise sued earnestly unto his Majesty for the maintenance of their antient liberties and priviledges which were confirmed unto them by the former Emperors, and that they might not be distracted from the Empire; yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding were constrained to undergo for a season the yoke of most grievous ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and servitude imposed by force upon them: and thus the poore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munaltie indured many mischiefes, and many grievous and cruell extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and indignities at the hands of the Emperours officers, whilest they lived in this wretched and miserable estate.</p>
               <p>Amongst the rest there was one called <hi>Grislier</hi> that began to erect a strong fort of defence upon a little hill neere unto Altorfe, to keepe the countrey in greater awe and subjection; and desiring to descrie his friends from his foes, he invented this devise: He put a hat upon the end of a long pole, and placed it in the field before Altorfe, where were great multitudes of people, with this commandement, That everie one that came by should do
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:59545:147"/>
but dieth ere he awaketh; so mony taken in usurie, delighteth and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at the first, but it infecteth all his possessions, and sucketh out the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of them ere it be long: Seeing then it is abhominable both by the law of God and nature, let us shun it as a toad, and flie from it as a cockatrice: But when these persuasions will not serve, let them turne their eyes to these examples following, wherein they shall see the manifest indignation of God upon it.</p>
               <p>In the Bishopricke of Collen a notable famous Usurer lying upon his death-bed ready to die, moved up and downe his chaps and his lips, as if he <note place="margin">Discipul. de tempore.</note> had bin eating something in his mouth; and beeing demanded what hee eat, hee answered, his money, and that the divell thrust it in his mouth perforce, so that hee could neither will nor chuse but devour it: in which miserable temptation he died without any shew of repentance.</p>
               <p>The same author telleth of another Usurer, that a little before his death called for his bags of gold and silver, and offered them all to his soule, upon condition it would not forsake him: But if he would have given all the world, it could not ransome him from death: wherefore when he saw there was no remedie but hee must needs die, hee commended his soule to the Divell, to be carried into everlasting torments: which words when hee had uttered hee gave up the ghost.</p>
               <p>Another Usurer being ready to die, made this his last Will and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: My soule (quoth he) I bequeath to the divell who is owner of it, my wife likewise to the divell who induced me to this ungodly trade of life, and <note place="margin">Iohanaes An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glut.</note> my deacon to the divell for soothing me up, and not reproving me for my faults; and in this desperate persuasion he died incontinently.</p>
               <p>Usury consisteth not only in lending and borowing, but buying and selling also, and all unjust and crafty bargaining, yea and it is a kinde of usurie to detain through too much covetousnesse those commodities from the people which concerne the publike good, and to hoord them up for their private gain, til some scarcitie orwant arise; and this also hath evermore beene most sharpely punished, as by these examples may appeare. About the yeare 1543. at what time a great famine and dearth of bread afflicted the world, there was in Saxonie a countrey peasant, that having carried his corne to the market, and sold it cheaper than he looked for, as he returned homewards he fell into most heavy dumpes and dolours of minde with griefe that the price of graine was abated: and when his servants sang merrily for joy of that blessed cheapnesse, he rebuked them most sharpely and cruelly, yea and was so much the more tormented and troubled in minde, by how much he more he saw any poore soule thankfull unto God for it: but marke how God gave him over to a reprobate and desperate sence: Whilest his servants rode before, hee hung himselfe at the cart taile, being past recoverie of life ere any man looked backe or perceived him. A notable example for our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish cormorants, who joyne barne to barne, and heape to heape, and will not sell nor give a handful of their superfluitie to the poore, when it beareth a low price, but preserve it till scarcity and want come, and then they sell it at their owne rate; let them feare by this, lest the Lord deale so or worse with them.</p>
               <p>Another covetous wretch, when he could not sel his cornesodear as hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, said the mise should eat it rather than he would lessen one jot of the price thereof: Which words were no sooner spoken, but vengeance tooke
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:59545:147"/>
them: for all the mise in the countrey flocked to his barnes and fieldes, so that they left him neither standing nor lying corne, but devoured all. This story was written to <hi>Martin Luther:</hi> upon occasion whereof he inveying mightily against this cruell usurie of husbandmen, told of three misers <note place="margin">Luther.</note> that in one yeare hung themselves, because graine bore a lower price than they looked for: adding moreover, that all such cruell and muddy extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners deserved no better a doome, for their unimercifull oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Another rich farmer, whose barnes were full of graine, and his stacks <note place="margin">D. Pomeranus.</note> untouched, was so covetous withall, that in hope of some dearth and deere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of corne, he would not diminish one heape, but hoorded up dayly more and more, and wished for a scarcity upon the earth, to the end hee might enrich his coffers by other mens necessities. This cruell churle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced so much in his aboundance, that everie day he would go into his barnes, and feed his eyes with his superfluitie: Now it fell out as the Lord would, that having supped and drunke very largely, upon a night as hee went, according to his custome, to view his riches, with a candle in his hand, behold the wine, or rather the justice of God, overcame his sences, so that he fell downe suddenly into the mow, and by his fall set on fire the corne, being dry and easie to be incensed, in such sort that in a moment all that which he had scraped together and preserved so charily, and delighted in so unreasonably, was consumed and brought to ashes, and scarce he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe escaped with his life.</p>
               <p>Another in Misnia, in the yeare 1559, having great store of corne hoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedup, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh. Fincel li.</hi> 2.</note> refused to succor the necessitie of his poore &amp; halfe famished neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: for which cause the Lord punished him with a strange and unusuall judgement, for the corne which he so much cherished, assumed life, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came feathered fowles, flying out of his barnes in such abundance, that the world was astonished thereat, and his barnes left emptie of all provision, in most wonderfull and miraculous manner.</p>
               <p>No lesse strange was that which happened in a towne of France called <note place="margin">The same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</note> Stenchansen, to the Governour of the towne, who being requested by one of his poore subjects to sell him some corne for his money, when there was <note place="margin">Fides fit apud authorem.</note> none to be gotten elsewhere; answered, hee could spare none, by reason he had scarce enough for his owne hogs: which hoggish disposition the Lord requited in it owne kinde; for his wife at the next litter brought forth seven pigs at one birth to increase the number of his hogs: that as he had prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red filthie and ougly creatures before his poore brethren, in whom the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God in some sort shined forth, so he might have of his owne get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting more of that kinde to make much of, since hee loved them so well.</p>
               <p>Equall to all the former both in cruelty touching the person, and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle <note place="margin">The same.</note> touching the judgement, was that which is reported by the same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, to have happened to a rich couetous woman in Marchia, who in an extreame dearth of victuals, denyed not onely to relieve a poore man whose children were ready to starve with famine, but also to sell him but one bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shell of corne, when he wanted but a penny of her price: for the poore wretch making great shift to borrow that penny, returned to her againe, and desired her he might have the corn: but as he payed her the mony, the penny fell upon the ground by the providence of God, which as she stretched out

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:59545:149"/>
amongst all the excellent laws which he made, this was one, That all sports should be banished the Common-wealth, except shooting (whether with long bow or Crosse bow) and that no Cards nor Dice should be either made or sold by any; to the end that all occasion of gaming might bee taken away. Surely it would be very profitable and expedient for the Weale-pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, that this Ordinance might stand in use at this day, and that all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Mercers whatsoever, especially those that follow the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion, might forbeare the sale of all such paltry Wares: for the fault in selling such trash is no lesse than the abuse of them in playing at them, for so much as they upon greedinesse of so small a gaine, put as it were a sword into a mad mans hand, by ministring to them the instruments not onely of their sports, but also of those mischiefes that ensue the same. There a man may heare curses as rife as words, bannings, swearings, and blasphemies, banded up and downe; there men fret themselves to death, and consume whole nights in darke and divelish pastimes; some lose their horses, others their cloakes, a third sort all that ever they are worth, to the undoing of their houses, wives, and children; and some again from brau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings fall to buffetings, from buffets to bloudshedding, from bloudshedding to hanging: and these are the fruits of those gallant sports.</p>

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:59545:150"/>
but the more they wiped it, the more clearly it appeared; The rumor of this accident flew into the citie, and caused the people to flocke thicke and threefold unto the place, where they found the other two gamesters wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the boord; whom (by the decree of the Senate) they bound with chaines, and carried towards the prison; but as they passed with them through a gate of the citie, one of them was stroken suddenly dead in the midst of them, with such a number of lice and wormes creeping out of him, that it was both wonderfull and lothsome to behold: the third they themselves (without any further inquisition or triall) to avert the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which seemed to hang over their heads, put incontinently to death; the table they tooke and preserved it for a monument, to witnesse unto po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, both how an accursed pastime dicing is, and also what great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies and mischiefes grow thereby.</p>
               <p>But that we may see yet more the vanitie and mischievous working of this sport, I will report one storie more out of the same authour, though not equall to the former in strangenesse and height of sinne, yet as tragicall, and no lesse pitifull.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1550, there lived in Alsatia one <hi>Adam Steckman,</hi> one that <note place="margin">

               <p>We ought therefore to learne by all these things that have beene already spoken, to abstaine not onely from this cursed pastime, but also from extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, robberies, deceit, guile, and other such naughty practices that tend to the hurt and detriment of one another; and in place thereof to procure the good and welfare of each one in all kindenesse and equity, following the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles counsell, where he sayeth, <hi>Let them that stole steale no more, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

               <p>After that <hi>Caligula</hi> began to addict himselfe to impiety and contempt of <note place="margin">Dion.</note> God, presently being not curbed with any feare nor shame, he became most dissolute in all kinde of wickednesse; for at one time he caused to be slaine a great number of people for calling him young <hi>Augustus,</hi> as if it had beene an injury to his person to be so intituled: and to say briefly of all his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, there were so many of his kindred, friends, senators, and citizens, made away by his meanes, that it would be too long and tedious here to recite: wherefore seeing that hee was generally hated of the people for his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds, hee wished that they all had but one head, to the end (as it might seeme) that at one blow hee might dispatch them all. In sumptuousnesse and costlinesse of dishes and banquets, he neither found nor left his equall, <note place="margin">Sueton.</note> for he would sup up most pretious stones melted by art, and swallow down treasures into his belly: his banquets were often served with golden loaves and golden meats: in giving rewards hee was sometime too too prodigall, for he would cast great summes of money amongst the people certain dayes together, untill his bags were drawne drie, and then new strange shifts must be practised to fill them up againe: his subjects he over charged with many new-found and unjust taxes, exacting of them a tribute even for their meat: if there were any money controversies to be decided, the fourth part of the same was his share, which way soever the matter enclined: the eight penny of every Porters gaine throughout the citie (which with travell they ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) hee tooke into his purse: yea, and that which is more filthy and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest, the very whores and common strumpets payed him a yearely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue for their bauderies; which act, though most villanous and slandrous, yet is made a samplar to some of our holy Popes to imitate, and indeed hath of many beene put in practise: but to our purpose; whereas before his prodigality was so great as to scatter money like seed amidst the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; now his niggardlinesse grew on the other side so miserable, that hee would have the people upon the first day of the yeare, every one to give him a new-yeares-gift, he himselfe standing at the doore of his house like a beggar, receiving the peoples almes. Moreover, of all that ever gave their lusts the bridle to abuse other mens wives, hee was most impudent and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious;
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:59545:152"/>
for divers times he used to feast many faire Ladies and their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and after his good cheare ended, to overview them severally a part, as Merchants doe their wares; and to take her that pleased his fancie best into some secret place, to abuse at his pleasure: neither after the deed done to be ashamed to glory and vaunt himselfe in his wicked and filthy act. He committed incest with his owne sisters, forcing them to his lust, and by one of them had a daughter borne, whom (saith <hi>Eutropius)</hi> his abhominable concupiscence abused also in most filthy and preposterous manner: At length many conspired his destruction, but especially one of the Tribunes, which office we may after the custome of our French nation rightly terme the Marshalship, and the officer one of our foure Marshals, as <hi>Budeus</hi> saith) who shewed himselfe more eagerly affected in the cause than the rest, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued this enterprise in more speedy and desperate manner: for as the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant returned from the Theater by a by-way to his Pallace (the third day of the feast, which he celebrated in honour of <hi>Iulius Caesar)</hi> the Tribune pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented himselfe, as if in regard of his office, to import some matter of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance unto him: and having received a currish word or two at his hands (as his custome was) he gave him such a stroke betweene the head and the shoulders, that what with it and the blowes of his complices, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the same intent, rushed upon him, he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>laine amongst them, no man stirring a foot to deliver him out of their hands, though many looked on, and might have aided him if they would: he was no sooner slaine, but his wife incontinently was sent after, and his daughter also that was crushed to death against a wall; and thus came his wretched selfe, with his filthie progenie, to a wretched and miserable end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nero</hi> shewed himselfe not onely an enemy to God in persecuting his Church, but also a perverter and disturber of humane nature, in embruing <note place="margin">Sueton.</note> his hands in the bloud of his owne mother and grandmother, whom he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be put to death, and in killing his owne wife and sister, and infinite numbers of all kinde of people: beside, in adulteries he was so monstrous, that it is better to conceale them from modest eares, than to stirre up the puddle of so stinking and noysome a dunghill: for which his villanies the Senate condemned him to a shamefull and most ignominious death, and his armies and forces forsooke him: which when hee understood, he betooke him to flight, and hid himselfe in an out way amongst thornes and bushes, which with great paine having past through, being weary of his life, hee threw himselfe downe into a pit foure foot deepe; and when he could get none of his men to lay their hands upon him, he desperately and miserably slew himselfe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Domitian</hi> was a cruell enemy of the Christians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee rejected his owne <note place="margin">Sueton.</note> wife to take a new, and being covertly reproved by <hi>Helvidius</hi> for the same, in a Play of the divorce of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Enon,</hi> which he presented unto him, he put him to death for his labour. Many worthy Senatours and chiefe men,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:59545:153"/>
and such as had borne the office of the Consull, without just cause given of reprehension, were murdered by him: hee spared not his owne bloud and nearest allies, no nor his owne brother <hi>Titus,</hi> but what with poyson and sword, destroyed them all to confusion. But in the end, when hee saw that the world hated him for his outragious cruelties, he consulted with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologians and Conjurers, what death did waite for him; one of the which amongst the rest told him that hee should be slaine, and that very shortly: wherewithall being sore troubled, hee first caused him that had prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated this evill unto him, to be slaine: then he compassed himselfe with a strong guard, and to the end to see them that should come neare, hee made his gallery walls where hee walked, of such a kinde of glistring and shining stone, that he might see in them all about him, both behinde and before. When the day and houre which was fore-calculated for his death was come, one of the Conspirators came in with his left arme in a scarfe, as if he had beene sore hurt; feigning that he would bewray the whole treason which hee so much feared; and being entred his Chamber, he presented him with a long discourse in writing, touching the matter and manner of the Conspiracie: and when in reading the same, he saw him most astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; then he tooke occasion to strike him suddenly into the belly with his dagger, his owne servants making up the murther, when they saw him goe about to resist. And thus by all his wisedome and providence he could not rid himselfe from being surprised, nor hinder the execution of Gods just fore-appointed judgement. And these were the ends of those wicked Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, who in regard of their vile lives, were rather monsters than men; and not onely they whom we have named, but many moe also, as <hi>Antonius, Caracalla, Heliogabalus,</hi> and other like may bee worthily placed in this ranke.</p>
               <p>But of all, <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> is most famous: of whom is recorded in histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that hee was so prodigious in all gluttonie, filthinesse, and ribauldrie, that the like I thinke was never heard of, except those monsters that went before; and yet I suppose he surpassed them too. Such was the exceeding and luxurious pompe of this beast-like Emperour, that in his lampes hee used baulme, and filled his fish-ponds with rose-water: the garments which he wore were all of the finest gold and most costly silkes: his shooes gliste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with precious stones, curiously engraven: he was never two dayes ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with one kinde of meat, nor wore one garment twice; and so likewise for his fleshly wickednesse, he varyed it every time: Some dayes hee was served at meales with the braines of Ostriches, and a strange fowle called a Phylocapterie, another day with the tongues of Popingayes, and other sweet singing birds, being nigh to the sea; hee never used fish in places farre distant from the sea: all his house was served with most delicate fish: at one supper his table was furnished with seven thousand fishes, and five thousand fowles: At his remoovals in his progresse, there followed him commonly six hundred chariots: he used to sacrifice with young children, and preferred to the best advancements in the Common-wealth most light persons; as Bawdes, Minstrels, Players, and such like: in one word, hee was an enemy to all honesty and good order. And when he was fore-told by his Sorcerers and Astronomers, that he should die a violent death, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ropes of silke to hang himselfe, swords of gold to kill himselfe, and strong poysons in Jacinths and Emerauds to poyson himselfe, if needs hee
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:59545:153"/>
should thereto be forced: Moreover, hee made an high tower, having the boorded floore covered with gold plate, and broidered with pretious stones, from the which tower he might throw himselfe downe, if hee were pursued of his enemies. But notwithstanding all this provision, (Gods vengeance not permitting him to die as hee would) hee was slaine of the souldiers, drawne through the citie, and cast into Tiber, after hee had raigned two yeares and eight moneths.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tigellinus,</hi> one of the Captaines of <hi>Neroes</hi> guard, and a chiefe procurer and setter forward of his tyranny, was the cause of the death of many great personages in Rome: and being enriched by their spoyle and other such like robberies, after the death of <hi>Nero</hi> (whom in his extremity hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke) plunged himselfe, and wallowed in all manner of licentious and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate delights. Now though hee was worthy of a thousand deaths for his cruelties towards many good citizens, yet by the meanes of one <hi>Iunius,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Galba</hi> his chiefe minion, whose favour hee had by great summes of money bought and obtained (for hee gave unto his daughter at one time five and twenty thousand crownes, and to himselfe at another time a carknet worth fifteen thousand crownes for a present) he was spared and kept in safety: but as soon as <hi>Otho</hi> was installed in the Empire, his downfall and destruction began presently to follow: for <hi>Otho,</hi> to the end to gratifie the Romans, sent to apprehend him, who was then in his houses of pleasure in the field, banquetting and sporting with his harlots, and using all manner of riot, albeit by reason of a deadly disease which was upon him, hee was even at deaths doore. When hee saw himselfe thus taken, and that no meanes of escape was left, (no not by the vessels which he had prepared at the sea shore for purpose, if need were, to convey him away) and that hee which had commission to take him, would give him no advantage of esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, though he offered him great rewards for the same, he entreated onely leisure to shave his beard before he went; which being granted, he tooke a rasor, and in stead of shaving, cut his owne throat.</p>

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:59545:154"/>
deprive him both of his life and kingdome: which conspiracy though it came to light, yet for all that wanted not his due effect: for after hee had (through listning to false reports) put to death unjustly his truest and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest friends, and those that would indeed have helped him in his necessity, both with good advice and other succour, he was surprised as he walked in a narrow and strait way, and there cruelly murthered. Now there was one <hi>Andronodorus</hi> his brother in law, that aspired to the crowne, had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his manners, and thrust him forward to all these misdemeanours, to the end by those practises he might make him odious to his people, that by that meanes he might obtaine his owne purpose, as indeed he did: for after his death he seised upon the Scepter, though with no long enjoyance; for through the troubles and commotions which were raised in the countrey by his meanes, both hee, his wife, and whole race, together with the whole progenie of <hi>Hieronymus,</hi> whether innocent or guilty, were all utterly roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out and defaced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Andronicus</hi> was one of the most wickedest men that lived on the earth in his time; for he excelled in all kinde of evill: in ambition, boldnesse in doing mischiefe, cruelty, whoredome, adulterie, and incest also to make up the whole number: besides, he was so treacherous and disloyall, that hee traiterously slew the sonne and heire of the Emperour <hi>Emanuel,</hi> shutting him in a sacke, and so throwing him into the sea; after which, by violence he tooke possession of the Empire of Constantinople, and like a strong theefe seised upon that which was none of his owne; but as soone as he had gotten his desire, then began his lusts to rage and rave, then he fell to whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and forcing women and maids to his lust, whom after he had once rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of their chastities, he gave over to his bands and ruffians to abuse; and that which is more than all this, he ravished one of his owne sisters, and committed incest with her: moreover, to maintaine and uphold his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous estate, he slew most of the nobility, and all else that bore any shew of honesty or credit with them, and lived altogether by wrongs and extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: wherefore his subjects (provoked with these multitudes of evils which reigned in him, and not able to endure any longer his vile outrages and indignities) rebelled against him and besieged him, got him into their mercilesse hands, and handled him on this fashion following: first they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded him and spoyled him of his imperiall ornaments, then they pulled out one of his eyes, and set him upon an asse backward, with the tayle in his hand in stead of a Scepter, and a rope about his necke in stead of a crowne; and in this order and attyre they led him through all Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, the people shouting and reviling him on all sides, some throwing durt, others spittle, divers dung, and the women their pispots at his head: after all which banquetting dishes, he was transported to the gallowes, and there hanged, to make an end of all.</p>

burned to ashes: he counselled the Count of Foix his sonne to poyson his father, and not onely so, but gave him also the poyson with his owne hands, wherewith to do the deed: Moreover, above all this, lechery and Adultery <note place="margin">Nich.

It is true that he lived fifteene daies after this, but in so great griefe and torment, without sence of any helpe or assuagement by Physicke or Surgery, that at the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he died miserably: and so, as during his life his affection over burnt in lust, and his minde was alwayes hot, upon mischiefe and covetousnesse, so his dayes were finished with heat and cruell burning.</p>

               <p>Besides these, there was another king of the Scots, called <hi>Atherto,</hi> in the <note place="margin">The fame.</note> yeare of our Lord 240. who shewed himselfe also in like manner a most abhominable wretch: for he so wallowed in all manner of uncleane and effeminate lusts, that he was not ashamed to goe in the sight of the people playing upon a flute, rejoycing more to be accounted a good Fidler, than a good Prince; from which vices he fell at last to the deflouring and ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of maids and women, insomuch as the daughters of his nobles could not be safe from his insatiable and intollerable lust: wherefore being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by them, when hee saw no meanes to escape, hee desperately slew himselfe.</p>

covetousnesse, and luxury; and the judgement wherewith God hath hunted them up and downe both by sea and land, (as late and fresh histories doe testifie) are manifest witnesses of his heavy anger and displeasure against them: amongst all which, I will here insert none but that which is most notorious and worthy memory, as the wretched accident of <hi>Pamphilius No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vares,</hi> and his company: This man with six hundred Spaniards making for the coast of Florida, to seeke the gold of the river of Palme-trees, were so <note place="margin">Benzon.

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:59545:155"/>

Now <hi>Ferdinand</hi> being sent by his brother to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Spaine, with a great masse of gold to cleare himselfe of the death of <hi>Almagro,</hi> could not so well justifie the fact, as that all his treasure could save him from the prison; and what became of him afterwards, knowne it is to God, but not to the world. A while after, the fellowes and friends of <hi>Almagro,</hi> whose goods the Pizarrists hath seised upon, tooke counsell with <hi>Don Diego Almagro</hi> his sonne, to revenge the death of his father; therefore being in number but twelve, with unsheathed swords, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately burst into <hi>Francis Pizarres</hi> house, (then Marquesse and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Peru) and at the first brunt slew a Captaine that guarded the ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Hall, and next him <hi>Martin</hi> of Alcahtara, and other more, that kept the entrance of the Chamber, so that hee fell dead even at his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Marquesses feet: who albeit his men were all slaine before his eyes, and himselfe left alone amiddest his enemies, yet gave not over to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himselfe stoutly and manfully, untill all of them setting upon him at once, hee was stabbed into the throat, and so fell dead upon the ground; and thus finished hee and his complices their wretched dayes, answerable to their cruell deserts: but their murderers (though they deserved to bee thus dealt withall) yet for dealing in this sort without authority, were not faultlesse, but received the due wages of their furious madnesse: for <hi>Don Diego</hi> himselfe, after he had beene a while Governour of Peru, had his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my overcome and discomfited by the Emperours forces, and was betrayed into their hands by his owne Lieutenant of Cusco, where he thought to have saved himself, and right soone lost his head, with the greatest Captains and favourites that hee had, who were also quartered. Now of the five brethren wee have heard foure of their destructions, onely one remaineth (namely <hi>Gonzalle Pizarre)</hi> to bee spoken of; who being sent for by the Conquerours to be their Chieftaine and Protector against the Viceroy, that went about to make them observe the Emperours lawes and decrees, touching the liberty of the Indian Nation, was betrayed and forsaken by the same men that sent for him, and so fell into his enemies hands, that cut off his head: The Generall of his army, a covetous and cruell man, that in short space made away above three hundred Spaniards, and all as it were with his own hand; was drawn up and downe at a horse tayle the space of halfe a quarter of an houre, and then hanged upon the gallowes, &amp; quartered in foure parts. The Monke of Vauvard, called <hi>Vincent,</hi> who with his crosse and porteise had encouraged <hi>Pizarre</hi> and his army against <hi>Artabaliba,</hi> and was for that cause created Bishop of Peru, when <hi>Diego</hi> came to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement, fled into the Island Puna to escape his wrath; but in seeking to avoyde him, he fell into as great a snare; for the Islanders assaulted him one night, and knockt him to death with staves and clubs, together with forty Spaniards of his fellowship, that accompanied him in his flight, and started not from him in his death. And thus the good and holy Monke, for medling with, and setting forward the murder of so many poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was for his paines and good deeds justly rewarded by the Indians of that Island.</p>

Moreover, after and beside all these troubles, seditions, and civil warres of Peru, all they that returned from Spaine, suffered shipwracke for the most part: for their fleet had scarce attained the midst of their course, when there arose so terrible a tempest, that of eighteen ships, thirteen so perished, that they were never heard of after; and of the five which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, two were tumbled backe to the coast of Saint Dominick, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and shivered in pieces; other three were driven to Spaine, whereof one hitting against the bay of Portugall, lost many of her men: The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall her selfe of this fleet perished near unto Saint Lucar de Baramede, with two hundred persons that were within her, and but one onely of them all got safe into the haven of Calix, without dammage.

Being made Duke of Plaisence and Parma, he exercised most cruell tyranny towards many of his subjects; insomuch, that divers Gentlemen that could not brook nor endure his injuries, conceived an inward hate against him, and conspired his death: and for to put in practise the same, they hired certain Ruffians and Roysters to watch the opportunity of slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; yea, and they themselves oftentimes went apart with these Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, keeping themselves upon their guards, as if some private and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular quarrels had been in hand. One day as the Duke went in his horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litter out of his Castle, with a great retinue, to see certain Fortifications which he had prepared, being advertised by his father the Pope (by the helpe of Magicke which he practised) to look diligently to himselfe the tenth day of September: in which notwithstanding he was slain; for as he returned into his Castle, the Conspiratours, to the number of thirty six, marched before him, as it were to do him honour, but indeed to do him villany: for as soon as he was entred the Castle, they drew up the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge for fear of his retinue that were without, and comming to him with their naked swords, cast in his teeth his tyranny, and so slew him in his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, together with a Priest, the master of his horse, and five Almaignes that were of his Guard: his dead body they hung by a chain over the wals, and shaking it to and fro to the view of the people, threw it downe headlong at last into the ditch; where the multitude to shew their hates, wounded it with daggers, and trampled it under their feet: and so whom they durst not touch in his life, being dead they thus abused: and this befell upon the tenth day of September, in the year of our Lord 1547.</p>

And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have a manifest example in <hi>Iohn</hi> the thirteenth, who pulling out the eyes of some of his Cardinals, cutting out the tongues of others, hewing off the hands, noses, and privy members of others, shewed himselfe a paterne of such cruelty, as the world never saw the like: he was accused before the Emperour <hi>Otho,</hi> in a Synod, first for incest with two of his own sisters: secondly, for calling the devill to helpe him at dice: thirdly, for promoting young infants to Bishoprickes, bribed thereto by certain pieces of Gold; fourthly, for the ravishing of maids and wives, and lying with his fathers concubine: yea, and lastly, for lyingwth his own mother, and many other such monstrous villanies: for which cause he was deposed from the Papacy, though re-installed again by the suit and cunning practise of his Whores; by whom as he recovered his triple Crown, so he lost shortly after his vicious life, by the meanes of a married whore that betrayed him.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Gregory</hi> the seventh, was adorned with all <note place="margin">Benno.

               <p>Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the sixth, of name contrary to his nature, for his incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, cruelty and pride towards the Emperour <hi>Lewis</hi> of Bavaria, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable; he procured many horrible warres against the Empire, and caused the destruction of twenty thousand Frenchmen by the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, yea and poysoned the good Emperour also, so well he wished to him: Howbeit ere long himselfe was stifled to death, and that suddenly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not by any practise of man, as it was thought, but by the especiall hand of God, in recompence of all his notable acts.</p>

In our English Chronicles we have recorded a notable history to the like effect of King <hi>Canutus</hi> the Dane, who after much trouble, being established in the Kingdome of England, caused a Parliament to bee held at London; where (amongst other things there debated) it was propounded to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Barons, and Lords of that Assembly, Whether in the composition made betwixt <hi>Edmond</hi> and <hi>Canutus</hi> any speciall remembrance was made for the children or brethren of <hi>Edmond,</hi> touching any partition of any part of the land? which the English Lords, flattering the king, though falsly and against the truth, yea and against their owne consciences, denied to be; and not onely so, but for the Kings pleasure confirmed their false words with a more false oath, that to the uttermost of their powers they would put off the bloud of <hi>Edmond</hi> from all right and interest: by reason of which oath and promise they thought to have purchased with the King great favour; but by the just retribution of God it chanced farre otherwise: for many of them, or the most part, especially such as <hi>Canutus</hi> perceived to have sworne fealtie before time to <hi>Edmond</hi> and his heires, he mistrusted and disdained ever after: insomuch, that some he exiled, many he beheaded, and divers by Gods just judgement died suddenly.</p>
               <p>In the Scottish Chronicles we read how <hi>Hamilton</hi> the Scot was brought unto his death by the false accusation of a false Frier called <hi>Campbel:</hi> who being in the fire ready to be executed, cited and summoned the said Frier to appeare before the high God, as generall Judge of all men, to answer to the innocency of his death, and whether his accusation were just or not, betwixt that and a certaine day of the next moneth, which he there named. Now see the heart and hand of God against a false witnesse, ere that day came the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er died without any remorse of conscience; and no doubt he gave a sharpe account to Almighty God of his malicious and unjust accusation.</p>
               <p>In the yeare of our Lord 1105, <hi>Henry</hi> Archbishop of Mentz, being complained of to the Pope, sent a learned man, a speciall friend of his, to excuse him, named <hi>Arnold;</hi> one for whom he had much done, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to great livings and promotions: but this honest man in stead of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser became an accuser; for hee bribed the two chiefest Cardinals with gold, and obtained of the Pope those two to be sent Inquisitors about the Archbishops case: The which comming into Germany, summoned the said <hi>Henry,</hi> and without either law or justice, deposed him from his Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishoprick, and substituted in his place <hi>Arnold,</hi> upon hope of his Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall gold: Whereupon that vertuous and honourable <hi>Henry</hi> is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have spoken thus unto those perverse Judges: If I should appeale to <note place="margin">Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents.</note> the Apostolike Sea, for this your unjust processe had against me, perhaps I should but lose my labour, and gaine nothing but toyle of body, losse of goods, affliction of minde, and care of heart: Wherefore I doe appeale to the Lord Jesus Christ, as to the most highest and just Judge, and cite you before his judgement seat, there to answer for this wrong done unto me; for neither justly, nor godly, but corruptly, and unjustly, have you judged my cause. Whereunto they scoffingly said, Goe you first, and we will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Not long after, the said <hi>Henry</hi> dyed: whereof the two Cardinals ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intelligence, said one to the other jestingly, Behold he is gone before, and wee must follow according to our promise. And verily they spoke truer than they were aware; for within a while after they both dyed in one day: the one sitting upon a jakes to ease himselfe, voyded out all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:59545:160"/>
into the draught, and miserably ended his life: the other gnawing off the fingers of his hands, and spitting them out of his mouth, (all deformed in devouring of himselfe) died. And in like wise not long after the said <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi> was slaine in a sedition, and his body for certaine dayes lying stinking above the ground unburied, was open to the spoyle of every raskall and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot. And this was the horrible end of this false accuser, and those corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Judges.</p>
               <p>Thus were two Cardinals punished for this sinne: and that we may see that the holy father the Pope is no better than his Cardinals, and that God spareth not him no more than he did them; let us heare how the Lord pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished one of that ranke for this crime.</p>
               <p>It is not unknowne, that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth condemned the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Fredericke</hi> at the Councell at Lyons, his cause being unheard, and before hee could come to answer for himselfe: For when the Emperour, being summoned to appeare at the Councell, made all haste hee could thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward, and desired to have the day of hearing his cause prorogued, till that he might conveniently travell thither; the Pope refused, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Gods law, to Christian Doctrine, to the prescript of the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reason, and to all humanity, without probation of any crime, or pleading any cause, or hearing what might be answered, taking upon him to be both Adversary and Judge, condemned the Emperour being absent. What more wicked sentence was ever pronounced? What more cruell fact (considering the person) might be committed?</p>
               <p>But marke what vengeance God tooke upon this wicked Judge. The writers of the Annals record, that when <hi>Fredericke</hi> the Emperour, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade</hi> his sonne were both dead, the Pope gaping for the inheritance of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Sicilie, and thinking by force to have subdued the same, came to Naples with a great hoast of men: where was heard in his court manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounced this voyce; <hi>Veni miser ad judicium Dei,</hi> Thou wretch come to receive thy judgement of God. And the next day the Pope was found in his bed dead, all black and blew, as though he had beene beaten with bats. And this was the judgement of God which he came unto.</p>
               <p>To this Pope and these Cardinals let us adde an Archbishop, and that <note place="margin">Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, pag. 700.</note> of Canterbury; to wit, <hi>Thomas Arundel,</hi> upon whom the justice of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared no lesse manifestly than on the former: For after hee had unjustly given sentence against the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> he died himselfe before him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so striken in his tongue, that he could neither swallow nor speake for a certaine space before the time of his death.</p>
               <p>Hither might be adjoyned the vengeance of God upon Justice <hi>Morgan,</hi> who condemned to death the innocent Lady <hi>Iane;</hi> but presently after fell madde, and so dyed, having nothing in his mouth but Lady <hi>Iane,</hi> Lady <hi>Iane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the reigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, one <hi>Richard Long,</hi> a man of armes in Calice, bore false witnesse against master <hi>Smith,</hi> the Curate of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Parish in Calice, for eating flesh in Lent, which hee never did: but hee escaped not vengeance; for shortly after he desperately drowned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. A terrible example unto all such as are ready to forsweare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on a Booke upon malice, or some other cause: a thing in these dayes over rise every where, and almost of most men little or nothing regarded.</p>
               <p>About the same time one <hi>Gregory Bradway</hi> committed the same crime
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:59545:160"/>
of false accusation against one <hi>Broke,</hi> whom being driven thereunto by feare and constraint, he accused to have robbed the Custome-house, wherein hee was a Clerke, of foure groats every day; and to this accusation he subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed his hand: but for the same presently felt upon him the heavy hand of God; for being grieved in his consciene for his deed, hee first with a knife enterprised to cut his owne thro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t; but being not altogether dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched therewith, the Gaoler comming up and preventing his purpose, hee fell forthwith into a furious frenzie; and in that case lived long time after.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we may adde the example of one <hi>William Feming,</hi> who accused an <note place="margin">Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents.</note> honest man called <hi>Iohn Cooper,</hi> of speaking trayterous words against Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> and all because he would not sell him two goodly bullockes which he much desired: for which cause the poore man being arraigned at Berry in Suffolke, was condemned to death by reason of two false witnesses which the said <hi>Feming</hi> had suborned for that purpose, whose names were <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Greenwood;</hi> so this poore man was hanged, drawne, and quartered, and his goods taken from his poore wife and nine children, which are left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of all helpe: but as for his false accusers, one of them died most miserably; for in harvest time being well and lusty, of a sudden his bowels fell out of his body, and so he perished: the other two what ends they came unto, it is not reported; but sure the Lord hath reserved a sufficient pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for all such as they are.</p>
               <p>Many more be the examples of this sinne, and judgements upon it; as <note place="margin">Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, pag. 2100.</note> the Pillories at Westminster, and daily experience beareth witnesse; but these that we have alledged shall suffice for this purpose: because this sinne is cousin Germane unto perjury, of which you may read more at large in the former booke. It should now follow by course of order, if wee would not pretermit any thing of the law of God, to speak of such as have offended against the tenth Commandement, and what punishment hath ensued the same: but forsomuch as all such offences for the most part are included under the former, of which wee have already spoken; and that there is no adultery, nor fornication, nor theft, nor unjust warre, but it is annexed to, and proceedeth from the affection and the resolution of an evill and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate concupiscence, as the effect from the cause: therefore it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to make any particular recitall of them, more than may well bee collected out of the former examples added hereunto; that in evill concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence and affection of doing evill, which commeth not to act, (though it be in the sight of God condemned to everlasting torments) yet it doth not so much incurre and provoke his indignation, that a man should for that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cause be brought to apparent destruction, and be made an example to others, to whom the sinne is altogether darke and unknowne: therefore we will proceed in our purpose without intermeddling in speciall with this last Commandement.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O man ought to be ignorant of this, that it is the duty of a Prince, not onely to hinder the course of sin from bursting into action, but also to punish the doers of the Jame; making both civill justice to be administred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, and the law of God to be regarded and observed inviolably: for to this end are they ordained of God, that by their meanes every one might live a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlinesse and honesty: to the which end the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and administration of justice being most necessary, they ought not so to discharge themselves of it, as to translate it upon their Officers and Judges, but also to looke to the execution thereof themselves, as it is most needfull: for if law (which is the foundation of justice) be (as <hi>Plato</hi> saith) a speechlesse and dumbe Magistrate; who shall give voyce and vigor unto it, if not hee that is in supreame and soveraigne authority? For which cause the King is commanded in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> To have before him alwayes the <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 18. 19.</note> Booke of the Law, to the end to doe justice and judgement to every one in the feare of God. And before the creation of the Kings in Israel, the chiefe Captaines and Soveraignes amongst them were renowned with no other title nor quality, than of Judges. In the time of <hi>Deborah</hi> the Prophetesse, though she was a woman, the weaker vessell; yet because she had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting and governing of the people, they came unto her to seeke judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is said of <hi>Samuel,</hi> that he judged Israel so long, till being tyred with age, and not able to beare that burden any longer, hee appointed his sonnes for Judges in his stead: who when through covetousnesse they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <note place="margin">Judg. 4. 1 Sam. 7. 8.</note> justice, and did not execute judgement like their father <hi>Samuel,</hi> they gave occasion to the people to demaund a King, that they might be judged and governed after the manner of other Nations: which things sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, that in old time the principall charge of Kings was personally to administer justice and judgement, and not as now to transferre the care thereof to others.</p>
               <p>The same we read of King <hi>David,</hi> of whom it is said, That during his reigne he executed justice and judgement, among his people: and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">1 Chron. 18.</note> place, That men came unto him for judgement, and therefore he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.</note> not to heare the complaint of the woman of Tekoah; shewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe herein a good Prince, and as the Angel of God, to heare good and evill: for this cause <hi>Solomon</hi> desired not riches, nor long life of the Lord, but a wise <note place="margin">2 Sam. 14.</note> and discreet heart to judge his people, and to discerne betwixt good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill: which request was so agreeable and acceptable to God, that hee gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">1 King 3.</note> it unto him; so that he obtained such an excellent measure of incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wisedome, that he was commended and reputed more for it, than for all his great riches and precious treasure beside. There is mention made in the Book of the Kings of his judiciall throne wherein he used to sit and heare the causes of the people, and execute justice among them; and albeit he was the
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:59545:161"/>
most puissant and glorious King of the earth, yet notwithstanding hee scorned not to hear two harlots plead before him about the controversie of a dead infant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioram</hi> King of Israel, son of <hi>Achab,</hi> though a man that walked not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly <note place="margin">2 King. 6.</note> before God, but gave himselfe to worke abomination in his sight; yet he despised not the complaint of the poor affamished woman of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, when she demanded justice at his hands, although it was in the time of war when Lawes use to be silent, and in the besieging and famishment of the City; neither did he reject the Sunamites request, for the recovery of <note place="margin">2 King. 8.</note> her house and lands, but caused them to be restored unto her. So that then it is manifest, that those Kings which in old time reigned over the People of God, albeit they had in every City Judges, yea and in Jerusalem also, as it appeareth in the nineteenth Chapter of the second Book of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles; yet they ceased not for all that to give ear to suits and complaints that were made unto them, and to decide controversies that came to their knowledge: and for this cause it is that Wisdom saith, That by her Kings <note place="margin">Prov. 8. 15.</note> reigne, and Princes decree justice: whereunto also belongeth that which is said in another place, That a King sitting in the Throne of judgement <note place="margin">Proc. 20. 8.</note> chaseth away all evill with his eyes.</p>
               <p>Moreover, that this was the greatest part of the Office and duty of Kings in antient times to see the administration of justice, <hi>Homer</hi> the Poet may be a sufficient witnesse, when he saith of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> That the Scepter and Law was committed to him by God, to do right to every man: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the which, <hi>Virgil</hi> (describing the Queen of Carthage) saith, She sat in judgement in the midst of her People: as if there was nothing more beseeming such a person than such an action. And therefore the Poets not without cause feigne <hi>Iupiter</hi> alwayes to have <hi>Themis</hi> (that is to say, Justice) at his elbow; signifying thereby, not that whatsoever Kings and Princes did was just and lawfull, be it never so vile in it own nature (as that wanton flatterer <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> said to <hi>Alexander)</hi> but that equity and justice should alwayes accompany them, and never depart from their sides. And hereupon it was that <hi>Eacus, Minos,</hi> and <hi>Radamanthus</hi> the first King of Graecia, were so renowned of old antiquity, because of their true and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right execution of Justice, and therefore were not honoured with any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter title than the name of Judges.</p>
               <p>It is said of King <hi>Alexander,</hi> that although he was continually busied in <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> affaires of war, and of giving battels, yet he would sit personally in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to hear criminall causes and matters of importance pleaded; and that whilest the accuser laid open his accusation, he would stop one ear with his hand, to the end that the other might be kept pure and without prejudice, for the defence and answer of the accused. The Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours <note place="margin">Sueton.</note> also were very carefull and diligent in this behalfe: as first <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> who is recorded to have taken great paines in giving audience to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and in dealing justice betwixt them. In like manner <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> is commended for his care and travell in this behalfe: for he would ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily sit in judgement upon causes and controversies of his subjects, and that with such great delight and pleasure, that oftentimes night was fain to interrupt his course, before his will was to relinquish it: yea, though he found himselfe evill at case, yet would he not omit to apply himselfe to the division of judgement, or else calling the parties before him to his bed.</p>

The Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> though a man otherwise of a dull and grosse spirit, yet in this respect he discharged the duty of a good Prince, for that he would intermeddle with hearing his subjects causes, and do right unto them: he chanced once to make a very pretty and witty end of a suit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a son and his mother, who denying and disclaiming him to be her son, was by the Emperour commanded to marry him; and so lest he should agree to that mischief, was constrained to acknowledge and avow him for her son: and to be short, it was very ordinary and usuall among the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, to take knowledge of matters controverted, but especially of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall and capitall causes; by meanes whereof the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> desirous to shun the judgement and lyings in wait of his enemies the Jewes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed from them to <hi>Caesar;</hi> which he would never have done, if <hi>Caesar</hi> had not in some sort used to meddle with such affaires; and for further proof hereof, hither may be added the saying which is reported of <hi>Nero,</hi> in the beginning of his reigne, That when he should signe with his hand a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death against a condemned person, he wished that he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther write nor reade, to the end to avoid that necessary action.</p>

               <p>In the yeare of our Lord 978, <hi>Egelrede</hi> the sonne of <hi>Edgare</hi> and <hi>Alphred,</hi> King of England, was a man of goodly outward shape and visage, but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to idlenesse, and abhorring all Princely exercises: besides, he was a lover of ryot and drunkennesse, and used extreame cruelty towards his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, having his eares open to all unjust complaints; in feats of armes of all men most ignorant: so that his cruelty made him odious to his subjects, and his cowardise encouraged strange enemies to invade his kingdome; by meanes whereof England was sore afflicted with warre, famine and pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. In his time (as a just plague for his negligence in Governement) decayed the noble Kingdome of England, and became tributary to the Danes: for ever when the Danes oppressed him with warre, he would hire them away with summes of money, without making any resistance against them: insomuch, that from ten thousand pounds by the yeare, the tribute arose in short space to fifty thousand: wherefore he devised a new tricke, and sought by treacherie to destroy them, sending secret Commissioners to the Magistrates throughout the Land, that upon a certaine day and houre assigned, the Danes should suddenly and joyntly bee murdered: Which massacre being performed, turned to be the cause of greater misery: for <hi>Swaine</hi> King of Denmarke hearing of the murder of his countrey-men, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a strange army in divers parts of this Realme, and so cruelly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy and pitty spoyled the Countrey, and slew the people, that the Englishmen were brought to most extreame and unspeakable misery, and <hi>Egelrede</hi> the King driven to flie with his wife and children to <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of Normandie, leaving the whole Kingdome to bee possessed of <hi>Swaine.</hi>

discretion, and justice: which thing caused first great variance betwixt him and his nobles, so that shortly he became to them most odious, and in the end was deprived of his kingdome: for the Scots that were so curbed in his fathers dayes, now playd rex through his negligence, and made many irruptions into his land, killing and discomfiting his men at three sundry battailes: besides, <hi>Charles</hi> of France did him much scath upon his lands in Gasconie and Guyan; and at last <hi>Isabell</hi> his owne wife, with the helpe of Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> of Henault and his Henowaies (to whom the nobles and commons gave their assistance) tooke him and deprived him of his crowne, installed his young sonne <hi>Edward</hi> in his place, keeping him in prison at Bartcley, where not long after he was murdered by Sir <hi>Roger Mortimer.</hi>

<pb n="411" facs="tcp:59545:166"/>
surplus of their payments which is due unto them: For what were it for a notorious and cruell Tyran that had committed many foule and wicked deeds, or had most villanously murdered many good men, to have no other punishment but to be slaine, and to endure in the houre of death some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary paine; could such a punishment ballance with his so many and great offences? Whereas therefore many such wretches suffer punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this world, we must thinke that this is but a taste and scantling of those torments and punishments which are prepared and made ready for them in the world to come. And therefore it often commeth to passe, that they passe out of this life most quietly, without the disturbance of any crosse or punishment; but it is that they might be more strangely tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in another world. Some not considering this point, nor stretching the view of their understanding beyond the aspect of their carnall eyes, have fallen into this foolish opinion, to thinke that there is neither justice nor judgement in heaven, nor respect of equity with the Highest: when they see the wicked to flourish in prosperity, and the good and innocent to bee overwhelmed with adversity, yea and many holy men have fallen into this temptation, as <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>David</hi> did, who when they considered the condition <note place="margin">Job. 12. &amp; Psal. 73.</note> of the wicked and unjust, how they lived in this world at their hearts ease, compassed about with pleasures and delights, and waxing old in the same, were carried to their sepulchres in peace; they were somewhat troubled and perplexed within themselves, untill being instructed and resolved by the Word of God, they marked their finall end and issue, and the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perdition which was prepared for them, and by no means could be esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.

There is therefore great difference betwixt the punishments of each of these, for the one tendeth to honour and life, the other to shame and confusion: and even as it is not the greatnesse of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that maketh the martyr, but the goodnesse of the cause; so the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of punishment unjustly, neither maketh the party afflicted guilty, nor any whit diminisheth his reputation: whereas the wicked that are justly tormented for their sinnes, are so marked with infamie and dishonour, that the staine thereof can never be wiped out.</p>

But Gods vengeance following him, as he came into a Village of the Dukedome of Wittenberg, he sat there in his Inne very sad: the host required of him what was the cause of his sadnesse; he answered, that he would not have him terrified, if he heard a great noise and shaking of the house that night; which happened according to his presage: for in the morning hee was found dead, with his necke wrung behinde him; the Devill whom he served having carried his soule into hell.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N Ale-wise in Kesgrave neare to Ipswich, who would needs force three Serving-men (that had been drinking in her house, and were taking their leaves) to stay and drinke the three outs first: that is, Wit out of the head, Money out of the purse, Ale out of the barrell: as shee was comming towards them with the pot in her hand, was suddenly taken speechlesse and sickher tongue swolne in her head; she never recovered speech, but the third day after died. This Sir <hi>Anthony Felton</hi> the next Gentleman and Justice, with divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, eye-witnesses of her in sicknesse, related to me; whereupon I went to the house with two or three witnesses, and enquired the truth of it.</p>
               <p>Two servants of a Brewer in Ipswich, drinking for a rumpe of a Turkey, strugling in their drinke for it, fell into a scalding Caldron backwards; whereof the one died presently, the other lingringly, and painfully, since my comming to Ipswich.</p>
               <p>A man comming home drunk, would needs goe and swimme in the mill pond; his wife and servants knowing he could not swimme, dissuaded him, once by intreaty got him out of the water, but in he would needs goe again, and there was drowned. I was at the house to enquire of this, and found it to be true.</p>
               <p>In Barnewell neare to Cambridge, one at the signe of the Plough, a lusty young man, with two of his neighbours, and one woman in their company, agreed to drinke a barrell of strong beere; they drunke up the vessell, three of them died within foure and twenty houres, the fourth hardly escaped af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter great sicknesse. This I have under a Justice of Peace his hand neare dwelling, besides the common fame.</p>
               <p>A Butcher in Haslingfield hearing the Minister inveigh against drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, being at his cups in an Ale-house, fell a scoffing at the Minister and his Sermons. As he was drinking, the drinke, or something in the cup quackned him, and stuck so in his throat, that he could neither get it up not downe, but strangled him presently.</p>
               <p>At Tillingham in Dengy hundred in Essex, three young men meeting to drinke strong waters, fell by degrees to halfe pintes: one fell downe dead in the roome, and the other, prevented by company comming in, esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped not without much sicknesse.</p>

At Bungey in Norfolke, three comming out of an Ale-house in a very darke evening, swore they thought it was not darker in hell it selfe: one of them fell off the bridge into the water, and was drowned; the second fell off his horse; the third sleeping on the ground by the river side was frozen to death. This have I often heard, but have no certaine ground for the truth of it.</p>
               <p>A Bay life of Hedly upon the Lords day being drunke at Melford, would needs get upon his mare to ride through the street, affirming (as the report goes) that his mare would carry him to the Devill: his mare casts him off, and broke his necke. Instantly reported by sundry sufficient witnesses.</p>
               <p>Company drinking in an Ale-house at Harwich in the night over against one Master <hi>Russels,</hi> and by him once or twice willed to depart; at length he came downe and tooke one of them, and made as he would carry him to prison, who drawing his knife, fled from him, and was three dayes after ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the sea with the knife in his hand. Related to me by Master <hi>Russel</hi> himselfe, Maior of the town.</p>
               <p>At Tenby in Pembroke-shire, a drunkard being exceeding drunke, broke himselfe all to pieces from an high and steep rock, in a most fearefull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and yet the occasion and circumstances of his fall so ridiculous, as I thinke not fit to relate, least in so serious a judgement I should move laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Reader.</p>
               <p>A Glasier in Chancery lane in London, noted formerly for profession, fell to a common course of drinking; whereof being oft by his wife and many Christian friends admonished, yet presuming much of Gods mercy to himselfe, continued therein, till upon a time having surcharged his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke with drinke, he fell a vomiting, broke a veine, lay two dayes in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame paine of body, and distresse of minde, till in the end, recovering a little comfort, died. Both these examples were related to me by a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of worth upon his owne knowledge.</p>
               <p>Foure sundry instances of drunkennesse, wallowing, and tumbling in their drinke, slaine by carts; I forbeare to mention, because such examples are so common and ordinary.</p>
               <p>A Yeomans sonne in Northampton-shire being drunke at Welling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough on a market day, would needs ride his horse in a brayery over the ploughed lands, fell from his horse, and brake his necke. Reported to me by a kinsman of his owne.</p>
               <p>A Knight notoriously given to drinke, carrying sometime payles of drinke into the open field to make people drunke withall: being upon a time drinking with company, a woman comes in, delivering him a ring with this poesie, <hi>Drinke and die;</hi> saying to him, This is for you; which he tooke and wore: and within a week after came to his end by drinking. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by sundry, and justified by a Minister dwelling within a mile of the place.</p>
               <p>One of Aylesham in Norfolke, a notorious drunkard, was drowned in a shallow brooke of water, with his horse by him.</p>

                  <hi>These examples before going, are taken out of the report of that worthy Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of Gods word in Ipswich, Master</hi> Samuel Ward, <hi>in his Sermon called</hi> A woe to Drunkards: <hi>to the which I will adde one more of mine owne knowledge lately executed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A young Gentleman of good fame, credit, and behaviour, being in July last overtaken by drinke, and riding homeward void of wit and feare, was throwne by his horse, and his braines knocked out with the pummell of his sword. An example more remarkable for two causes: first, because he was not formerly given to that vice; and secondly, in that a friend of his meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by the way, intreated him that he would ride softly, and he would conduct him home; but he desperately spurring his horse over rough wayes, was thus overthrowne and perished: but I hope God had mercy on his soule.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his three and thirtieth Sermon <hi>Ad fratres in eremo,</hi> relateth this strange example of one <hi>Cyril,</hi> a Cittizen of Hippo, a man well esteemed and beloved in the Citie: He having one onely sonne, did so coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker him, forbearing either to checke him or correct him; but loving him (as that holy Father saith) not onely above all things, but even above God himselfe; that by his too much liberty and indulgence, his sonne grew won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull debaushed, and gave himselfe to filthy drunkennesse. Upon a time, being vilely overtaken with drinke, he came home, and tumbled over his

mother being great with childe, would have ravished his sister, slew his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and wounded to death two of his other sisters. O fearefull effect of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse! thus God punished the father for his too much love and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his sonne, and the sonne for his vile impiety.</p>
               <p>Not unlike to this I finde in <hi>Philip Lonicerus, Page</hi> 486. A certain man, saith he, that gave himselfe to the studie of Godlinesse, was daily assaulted with the temptation of the Divell, who perswaded him if hee would bee quiet, to choose one of these three sinnes, either to make himselfe drunke, or to commit adulterie with his neighbours wife, or to kill his neighbour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. The poore man thinking drunkennesse the least sinne, chose that; but being enraged with wine, he was easily drawn to the committall of the other sinnes; for being with wine enflamed, with lust he feared not to vitiate his neighbours wife, nor yet to kill her husband, comming in the meane while seeking to be revenged of him: so giving himselfe to drunkennesse, hee wraps himselfe in all other wickednesse.</p>
               <p>On the eighteenth of August 1629, one <hi>Thomas Wilson</hi> labourer, a knowne and common blasphemer of Gods name by oathes and curses, and given much to drinking to excesse, upon a slight occasion moved to displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against his wife, and not daring to doe much violence unto her, turned it upon himselfe, and with his knife stabbed himselfe, many of his friends and neighbours being present; and so he died.</p>
               <p>On the 10 day of May 1629, one <hi>Iohn Bone</hi> of Ely, (coachman unto one Master <hi>

               <p>I may be thought too prolix in this Argument of Gods Iudgements; but considering the fiercenesse of Gods wrath against notorious sinners, and the hardnesse of mens hearts to be drawne to repentance, nothing I thinke can be judged too much. But yet to sweeten these soure pills, let me cover them a little with the sugar of Gods mercifull protection of his children by his holy Angels.</p>

               <p>When <hi>Arcadius</hi> was Emperour of Rome, and Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Constantinople, there was <hi>Gainas,</hi> an Arrian, and a Barbarian by profession, who being powerfull and great, went about to thrust <hi>Arcadius</hi> out of his Seat; but the Emperour compounding with him, sent him unto Constantinople with a troupe of horse and foot, under the pay of the Emperour. This man desired to have a peculiar Church for them of his owne Sect, for the free exercising of their Religion: which being denyed by the Emperour, at the perswasion of Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi> the Tyrant raised his forces in the night to spoyle and havocke the Citie. But they were resisted the first and second night, by the shew of a great Armie of tall and lustie men, and so terrified, that they durst doe nothing. The third night the Tyrant himselfe, thinking this to be but a fable, came in his owne person with his whole Armie, and found the same resistance: wherewith being terrified, hee fled into Tracia; where hee was slaine most miserably. Thus this great Citie was protected by the ministery of Angels, as Hierusalem once was from the Tyran <hi>Zenacherib.</hi>

               <p>In the reigne of <hi>Pompilius</hi> King of Poland, as the Polonian Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles doe report, in the first booke, and twelfth Chapter, there came two men o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then they went to one <hi>Pyastus,</hi> a man of excellent holinesse and charity, who entertained them into his house very lovingly, broached a Vessell of sweet Wine for their drinke, and killed a fat Hogge for their meate, which hee had prepared against the first tonsure of his sonne, according to the custome of that Countrey. These men, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angels, finding this kinde entertainment, caused the Vessell of sweet Wine to multiply, so that the more they dranke, the more still remained behinde; and the Hogge also in like manner. At last they wrought means, that <hi>Pompilius</hi> the King being dead, this good man was chosen King in his stead; and then disparished and were never more seen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicephorus</hi> in his seventeenth booke, Chapter thirty five, reporteth a strange storie of a Jewish childe. This boy playing among other Christian children, was brought into the Temple by the Priest to care the reliques of the Sacrament, as the custome was: who tooke it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his followes. Which as soone as the Jew his father understood, he put him into a fierie oven to be tormented to death: his mother sought him up and downe the Citie, not knowing what was done; and at last, after three dayes, found him alive in the Oven: from whence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, there was no smell of fire about him. Thus God protected by his Angell this poore childe. <hi>Instinian</hi> the Emperour, after hee knew thereof, caused the boy and his mother to be baptized; and the father, who refused, he caused to be crucified to death.</p>
               <p>Under the Emperour <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Citie of Antioch was shaken with a terrible Earthquake, after this manner: There was a certaine
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:59545:182"/>
Citizen so given to bountifulnesse to the Poore, that hee would never suppe nor dine, unlesse hee had one poore man to be with him at his Table. Upon a certaine evening seeking for such a guest, and finding none, a grave old man met him in the Market-place, cloathed in white, with two companions with him, whom hee entreated to suppe with him: But the old man answered him, That he had more need to pray against the destruction of the Citie; and presently shooke his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefe against one part of the Citie, and then against another; and being hardly entreated, forbore the rest. Which hee had no sooner done, but those two parts of the Citie, terribly shaken with an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, were throwne to the ground, and thousands of men slain. Which this good Citizen seeing, trembled exceedingly. To whom the old man in white answered and sayed, By reason of charity to the poore his house and Familie were preserved. And presently these three men (which no question were Angels) vanished out of sight. This storie <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gubert</hi> in his Chron. reporteth, <hi>Anne</hi> 585.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip Melancthon</hi> reporteth, That in a certaine Village neare unto the Citie Sygnea, a woman sent her sonne into the wood to fetch home her Kine: in the meane while, such a snow fell, that the boy could not returne home againe: his parents the next day (taking more care for the boy then for the kine) went out to seeke him; and within three dayes, found him in the middest of the wood, sitting in a faire place where no snow had fallen: They demanded of him, Why he made not haste home: He answered, That he tarryed till it was evening; being insensible both of the time and of the cold: They asked him againe, Whether he had received any food or no? The boy answered, That a certaine man brought unto him bread and cheese, which hee did eate. Thus without doubt the childe was preserved by an Angell, and the man that brought him the bread and cheese was an Angel of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tiburtius</hi> the Governour of Areciam, a Heathen man, forbad two Christian brothers, <hi>Pergentinus</hi> and <hi>Laurentinus,</hi> to preach Christ: First, he allured them by flattering speeches; which when it succeeded not, he caused them to be beaten with clubbes. But the armes of them that beat them were so withered, that they could not strike a stroke: Then he went about to starve them in prison, but they were nourished by an Angell of God: After, hee commanded them to walke bare-footed upon burning coales, which they did without any sense of hurt: Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Image of <hi>Iupiter</hi> being brought unto them to worship, they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the name of Jesus, the brazen Image resolved into dust: whereupon many of the Heathen people forsooke their Idols, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto the faith of Christ.

               <p>In that battell wherein <hi>Iudas Machabeus</hi> overcame <hi>Timotheus,</hi> five men appeared in golden Armour; whereof two defended <hi>Machabeus,</hi> and the other three assaulted the enemies; the second of <hi>Machabees,</hi> Chapter the tenth. Likewise in the eleventh Chapter of the same Book, it is declared how two men in goodly Armour, and upon white horses, fought for the Jewes against their enemies; as <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> were seene to fight for the Romans against the Tusculans, at the Lake Regillum.</p>

When the Locrians made warre with the Crotolians, there was seen two goodly young men upon white horses, fighting for the Locrians; who as soone as the victory was gotten, were never seene more: which victory, at the same instant that it was gotten, was declared at Athens. Lacedemon, and Corinth; places farre distant from Locris and Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Attila</hi> the King of the Hunnes, calling himselfe the scourge of God, had with furious rage destroyed and wasted many Cities in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; he came at last to Rome, purposing also to destroy it: But Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Great, by the commandment of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour, came out unto him, and by his prayers and intreaties made him so milde, that presently without doing any hurt he returned into his owne Countrey. Hereupon, being demanded by his Nobles, Why he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe so obedient to the Romane Bishop; he answered, That it was not in honour of the Pope, but that he saw another man standing by in Priestly garments, threatning him with a naked sword in his hand, unlesse hee would yeeld unto Pope <hi>Leo.</hi> This doubtlesse was an Angell protecting of the Citie of Rome from that cruell and mercilesse Enemie.</p>
               <p>We reade in the lives of the Fathers, how a certaine religious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian was cast into prison by the souldiers of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostata, whom when <hi>Apolonius</hi> another godly Christian came to visit, the Centurion cast him also into prison, to accompany the other, and set souldiers to watch the prison lest they should escape; but late in the night an Angel of God was seene in a most cleare light, and broke open the prison dore: which being seene, the Watch fell downe before those holy men, and the Centurion that night having his house sore shaken with an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and some of his servants slaine; the next morning came and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the two holy men out of prison with great trembling and feare.</p>
               <p>We reade in the lives of the Fathers, of one <hi>Copres</hi> a holy man, that disputed with <hi>Manichee,</hi> and when hee could not put him downe in words, it was agreed betweene them, that the tryall of the truth of their religion should be made by fire: whereupon a fire being made in the Market-place, <hi>Copres</hi> went into it, and stood a time in it unhurt, being protected by the Angell of God; then the <hi>Manichee</hi> refusing to doe the like, was thrust into the middest of the fire by the people, and was so scortched, that he scarce escaped with his life; so that the people ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring his wicked doctrine, thrust him out of the Citie; saying, This seducer burneth alive.</p>

                  <hi>Baratanes</hi> the King of Persia made warre upon the Romanes; against whom <hi>Narsaeus</hi> the Emperours Generall prepared an Armie: and when the Constantinopolitanes were in great feare, two Angels in Bythinia charged certaine men that went to Constantinople, to tell the Citizens that they should give themselves to prayer and fasting, and feare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for they were sent of God to defend the Army of the Romanes against the Persians; which they did accordingly for the Persian Army was defeated by <hi>Narsaeus,</hi> and the Saracens that came to helpe them in great multitudes, were drowned in the river Euphrates.

But to come to examples of later memory. <hi>Melancthon</hi> in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the tenth Chapter of the prophesie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> relateth a storie of <hi>Gryneus</hi> a famous learned and godly man, who having offended the Bishop of Vienna, called <hi>Faba,</hi> in a disputation about Religion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto his sociates assembled together, whereof <hi>Melancthon</hi> was one: where discoursing of the disputation betweene him and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, I (saith <hi>Melancthon)</hi> was called out of the chamber, to speak with a certaine grave man, of a venerable countenance and habit, who told me that we should remove <hi>Gryneus</hi> out of that place presently, for the Sergeants were come to apprehend him, and to cast him into prison: whereupon we presently conducted him through the Citie, and brought him unto the rivers side, where we had him conveyed over into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jurisdiction: and at our returne to the Inne, found that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants had beene there. Thus, saith <hi>Melancthon,</hi> we see that this grave old man was an Angell of God, that came to protect the good man from his enemies.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1539, not farre from Sitta in Germany, in the time of a great dearth, and famine, a certaine godly matron having two sonnes, and destitute of all manner of sustenance, went with her children to a certaine fountaine hard by, praying unto Almighty God, that he would there relieve their hunger by his infinite goodnesse: as she was going, a certaine man met her by the way, and saluteth her kindly, and asked her whither shee was going; who confessed that she was going to that fountaine there, hoping to be relieved by God, to whom all things are possible; for if he nourished the children of Israell in the desart forty yeares, how is it hard for him to nourish me and my children with a draught of water: and when shee had spoken these words, the man, (which was doubtlesse an Angel of God) told her, that seeing her faith was so constant, she should returne home, and there should finde six bushels of meale for her and her children. The woman returning, found that true which was promised.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1558, a cruell tempest raged in Thuringea, beating downe houses, pulling up trees by the roots, and drowned by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the water above forty persons, men and women. In this feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full inundation of waters, a notable and miraculous example of Gods protection by Angels shewed it selfe: for there was a woman newly brought to bed of a childe, drowned, but the infant lying in a cradle, was carried with the violence of the water a great way off, and at last the cradle stopping at the bough of an apple-tree, was fastened till the waters decreased, and after divers dayes was found alive.</p>

               <p>Another example was related unto me by men of good credit, upon their owne knowledge; how a certaine man riding between two woods in a great tempest of thundering and lightening, rode under an Oake to shelter himselfe; but his horse would by no meanes stay under that Oake, winching, and kicking, and running away, whether his Master would or no: which his master perceiving, went unto another Oake hard by, where the horse stayed very quietly: but they had not long staid there, but the first Oake with a grievous clap of thunder and ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening was torne all to fitters, and the man and horse in the other place escaped safely: Oh the wonderfull protection of God, and that by the ministery of his holy Angels!</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1565, so great a tempest of raine and waters arose at Islebia, that it bare downe houses before it; it fell most violently upon the house of one <hi>Barthold Bogt,</hi> so that it broke downe the fore-part of his house, where lay a childe in a cradle; which the father, with hazard of his life, brought forth and carried into his adjoyning neighbours house: two other of his children endeavouring also to save, hee tooke in his armes to carry forth of the house, but the rage of the water hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him, so that they rested upon a beame; from whence the one of his children was violently taken out of his armes, and he and the other being shaken from the post, were carried into the Orchard; where fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding footing, stood up to the neck in water, with the childe in his armes; and looking about for his other childe, he found it sitting upon a piece of timber, and comming towards him, which hee also tooke into his armes, and got up into a high pile of wood, where he rested all night, none being able to afford him any helpe. The next morning, when the waters were decreased, he came downe to looke for two other of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

which he had left in an upper part of the house, whom hee found fast asleepe; now he had no sooner taken them from thence, but that part of the house fell downe also: where we may see a visible signe of Gods protection by his holy Angels, who not onely preserved all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, but also kept that part of the house from falling, wherein the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren lay sleeping, untill they were brought forth.</p>
               <p>Many more examples of this kinde might be added, but these shall suffice to shew Gods great providence towards his children; who as he punisheth the wicked with most severe Judgements, so he protecteth those that feare him with extraordinary providence by his holy Angels: to shew the truth of that, which the Apostle speaketh; that <hi>They are ministring Spirits, sent forth to waite upon them who shall be heires of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Hebrewes</hi> 1. <hi>Verse</hi> 14.</p>
