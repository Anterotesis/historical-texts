         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>Right Worshipful,</opener>
            <p>LET it not seem strange in so Solemn a Business, in which no less than the Preservation of Life, Health, and by consequence Wel-being of all the poor People in this Nation is concerned; in so weighty a business, contrary to all Presidents in this Nation, which is now Heart-sick of Ignorance, and cries out aloud for cure; in so Populous a City, and so full of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, before so many Ancient Physitians who might have done the Work better than I, had they not wanted will; neither could they have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that, had they not wanted real Love to this Nation: in such times (I say) in such a place, and before such People, for me whose years are few, whose Exercise in the <hi>Physical Sphere</hi> small, (my greatest Studies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spent about <hi>Natural Phylosophy)</hi> whose Judgment slender to venture upon this so great a Work as to attempt to rectifie the Judgments of a whol <hi>Colledg,</hi> (which is indeed no less needful than great) may seem to some perhaps, great Arrogancy and Presumption, to others no smal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency and want of discretion: Notwithstanding, the Glory of God being my Aim, and the good of this languishing Nation my End (I do not call the Nation languishing in respect of Government, but in respect of Knowledg, as for the Government of this Nation, God knows what he hath to do, and I hope well) which I say languisheth so sorely under a Disease which now turned Epidemical and rages so extreamly that it sweeps away millions in a year, leaving many woful Widdows, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therless Children to the protection of those whose mercies are cruelty, and that is <hi>Ignorance in Physick,</hi> or want of Knowledg of what may do them good; the Cure of this Disease cannot be performed neither by <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> nor the <hi>Phylosophers Stone,</hi> but by the <hi>real indeavors of a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Spirit</hi> by the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> and <hi>Love to poor People,</hi> by <hi>laboring to discharge a good Conscience,</hi> by <hi>instructing People what belongs to their Health;</hi> this I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you was the reason that moved me to adventure into the Stage of
<pb facs="tcp:54721:4"/>
the World in this Nature, and not any sinister ends of my own whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for it is not unknown to your <hi>Worship</hi> that I have incurred many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies by my writing, though I do good, and but my duty; yet I shall ever chuse rather to satisfie the Godly minds of real Common-wealths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in revealing to them what belongs to the Preservation of their Lives, and the helping of their poor Neighbors, than either wrong my own Conscience, or rob the whol Nation of what I may and ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal to them: I confess I have chiefly been reviled of those to whom I have done good, who have received their greatest Knowledg of Physick by my Writings; I can pity them, but do not wonder a whit at it; it hath been so even in the dayes of old, when <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> lived upon Earth, they cast out Devils, they cured their Diseases, they made the Blind to see, and the Lame to go, for which of all these good Deeds were they persecuted? doubtless it was done by that Monster <hi>Envy</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> rules in the children of Disobedience, who having joyned to himself <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Self-interest</hi> labors to surpress whatsoever is well done; but as I have fellowship with <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> in their Sufferings, so I look to have fellowship with them in that Glory into which no Proud, nor Envious, nor Self-seeking man shall enter. I can freely (as I hitherto have done) yet continue doing them good, as being perswaded that by so doing, I am the more like unto <hi>God,</hi> who <hi>causeth the Sun to shine upon the good and the bad, and the Rain to fall upon the just and the unjust;</hi> following that Rule which is so often repeated in holy Writ, <hi>If thy Enemy hunger give him meat, if he be athirst give him drink, for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the Lord shall reward thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Worthy Sir, This Child of mine coming out the fourth time into the World, and wanting Defence, as most Truths do, cried aloud for a Patron which made me so bold as to present it at your feet; rather I wil assure you, to take a Pattern of your Patience than any waies to make a purchase of my own praise, that so in despight of Cavaliers it may be called the God-child of a Peerless God-father. You must not expect large incomiums of praise from him whose words &amp; actions you know alwaies to be so plain, nor an Epistle stuffed as full of Flattery as an Egg is full of meat, which I hate to give, and you to receive, and God hates it in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he finds it; it is sufficient to you, and infinite joy to me, that your Works declare to the World what you are, even in these times when rich <hi>Pluto</hi> is accounted a better Phylosopher than learned <hi>Plato,</hi> when <hi>Godliness is not accounted great Gain,</hi> as it was in better times than now are, but <hi>Gain is accounted great Godliness.</hi> I had Reasons enough to make me bold to dedicate it to you, as namely, That Ingenuity of your Spirit, your excellent Endeavors for the publick Good, that admirable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy which Honor it self could not choak; so that your Splendor (like other Justices in Office with you) has not gone out like a Candle, and left a stinking snuff behind, though it hath pleased God to place you in Authority in such an Age, that calleth Vertue Vice, and Vice Vertue, that calleth Good, Evil, and Evil, Good, that strike at the Devil, and hit Christ in his Saints: To whom rather (these things considered) should I dedicate these my weak Labors, than to your self, to whom God
<pb facs="tcp:54721:4"/>
hath given the Knowledg to discern Vertue from Vice, to love the one and hate the other, according to that excellent Speech of <hi>Plato, Oh Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, how would men love thee if they did but know thee, for as Health is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Body, so is Knowledg the Conservation of the Mind,</hi> which is too too much absconded (the more is the pity) from the eyes of this langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing Nation, and calls aloud for a Cure, for as <hi>Plato</hi> saith in another place, <hi>If Vertue could take upon her a bodily shape, she would be so beautiful as men would be in love with her; also if Vice could take upon her a Bodily shape, she would be such an ugly beast all men would loath and disdain her, for if Drunkards have so many Apish and beastly postures, what would Drunkenness it self have, which is the Author of them all, if that could appear in a visible form?</hi> This I know you are well versed in; the love of a Real Common-wealth may be read in you even through a pair of Spectacles glassed with an inch board: this was another argument moving me to dedicate this Book to you, which tends towards the furtherance of a Common-wealth, and the pulling down a Monopoly extreamly prejudicial, yet scarce discernable.</p>
            <p>I must be brief, because it is brevity you delight in, therefore to use many words I account it needless; your kind acceptance of this Book, I shall account such a favor as is never to be forgotten: The God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth which hath hitherto preserved your Body in so many dangers and difficulties which you have passed, and your Spirit pure in these back-sliding Times, still be your Guide, and preserve your Spirit, Soul, and Body untill the time of your Change shall come, and present you blameless at the coming of the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ, in whom God hath loved you, and washed you from your sins in his Blood.</hi>

            <p>THose things which God did make first in the Beginning without means, He now preserveth by Means, and therefore He hath placed Nature in the World which by Motion acts in all things, according to the quality of the thing acted upon, as Fire acts upon Wood to make a fire to warm one by, or the like; therefore as the Cause of Diseases is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be Natural, so is their Cures also to be effected in a Natural way; and if you do but consider the whol Universe as one united Body, and Man an Epitomy of this Body, it will seem strange to none but Mad-men and Fools that the Stars should have influence upon the Body of Man, considering he being an Epitomy of the Creation, must needs have a Celestial World within himself; for to wind the strings a little higher, If there be a Trinity in the Deity (which is denied, but by none but Ranters) then must there be a Trinity also in all his Works, if there be a Unity in the God-head, there must needs be a Unity in all his Works, and a dependancy between them, and not that God made the Creation to hang together like Ropes of Sand, so God made but one world, and yet in this one World a Trinity, first Elementary, which is lowest; Secondly, Celestial, which is next above that; Thirdly, Intellectual, which is highest in degree, and happy, yea thrice happy is he that attains to it; if then Man be capable of the Intellectual World as having an Epitomy of that in himself, whereby he knows that there is a God, and that God made this World, and Governeth it now he hath made it, that there are Angels, and that he bath an immortal Spirit in himself which causeth him to hope and expect immortality; If he have an Epitomy of the Elementary World in himself, whereby he searcheth and seeks after the Vertues of Elementary Bodies, and the various mixtures of Natural things, their Causes, Effects, Times, Fashions, Events, and how they are produced by the Elements, must he not also by the same rule have an Epitomy of the Celestial World within himself, by which he searcheth out the Motion and Course of the Celestial Bodies, and what their influence is upon the Elements, and Elementary Bodies; he that denies this, let him also deny that the whol world was made for man, that so the world may see what he is; it is palpable to those that fear God, and are conversant either in his Word or in his Works, that every inferior world is Governed by its supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, and receives influence from it. God Himself the only First-being, the Maker and Disposer of all things, Governs the Celestial World by the Intellectual, namely, the Angels; He governs the Elementary World, and all Elementary Bodies, by the Celestial World, namely, the Stars; and that's the reason the influence' of the Stars reacheth not to the Mind or Rational part of Man, because it is an Epitomy of the Intellectual world which is a superior to them: but because there is now some Dispute about it (I should have said Cavelling) by such as would fain have their own Knaveries hidden, and therfore they would fain have the Stars made to stop Bottles, or else for the Angels to play at bowls with when they had nothing else to do, but not rule the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary world, no, by no means: We shall prove they rule over the Elementary world, first by Scripture, second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Reason.</p>
            <p>First, by Scripture: I beseech you read in the first place, <hi>Genesis</hi> 1. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. verses, <hi>And God said, let there be lights in the Firmament of the Heaven, to divide the Day from the Night: and let them be for SIGNS, and for SEASONS, and for DAIES and YEARS. And let them be for Lights in the Firmament of the Heaven to give light upon Earth: and it was so. And God made two great Lights, the greater light to RULE the day, the lesser Light to RULE the night, He made the Stars also. And set them in the Firmament of the Heaven to give light upon Earth. And to RULE over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from darkness.</hi> To this place also answers that in the 136. <hi>Psalm, He made the Sun to RULE by day, and the Moon and Stars to RULE by night.</hi> In these Scriptures God saith He made them to Rule, He set them for Signs, therefore they must signifie something, He set them also for Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, for <hi>Daies,</hi> and for <hi>Years:</hi> the Scriptures are so cleer, they need no Exposition.</p>
            <p>But let us see a little what Reason saith to the business: It is palbable and apparant that all Elementary Bodies never stand at a stay, but are ever either increasing or decreasing: It is as apparant that the Celestial Bodies are not changed, but remain the very same they were at the first Creation; and if so, the Elementary
<pb facs="tcp:54721:6"/>
Bodies must needs be by Nature Passive, because they are subject to change, and the Celestial Bodies active be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they change not; as a Carpenter when he hews a Timber-log, the Timber-log must needs change form according as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hewed, but the Carpenter himself changeth not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Consider that all Time is measured out by Motion, and that the Original of all Motion is in the Heavens, for it is the motion of the Sun which causeth day and night, Summer, Winter, Spring, and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest, from which Conversion of Times and Years all changes proceed, both Heat and Cold, Dryness and Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, by which four is caused Life and Death, Generation and Putrifaction, increase and decrease of Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary things, for the Elementary world is the womb of all Elementary Creatures, both Animals, Minerals, and Vegetables, it conceives them, and nourisheth and cherisheth them being conceived: this womb is alwaies full of useful Matter, fit for the forming, increasing, and conserving Bodies, whether Animal, Mineral, or Vegetable; the Sun gives a vital seed, and stirs up all to motion and action, quickens, and defends what it hath quickned; the Moon subministers moisture to preserve what the Sun hath Generated from the scorching heat which is caused by motion: both Sun and Moon make use of the other five Planets (even as the Heart and Brain make use of the Liver, Spleen, Gall, &amp;c. in the Body of Man) for the effecting and varying things below, and tempering them diverse waies according to their several motions, else all the things generated in the Elementary World would be of one Nature and Quality, and then the world could not subsist; for Man having all qualities in him, cannot subsist without any one of them: He, and he only is a Physitian that knows which of these qualities offends, by which of the Celestial Bodies it is caused, and how safely and speedily to remedy it; all the the rest that practice Physick are but Mountebanks, for there is no question to be made, but that all Diseases have their original from super-aboundance or deficiency of Heat, Coldness, Dryness or Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture; and that the Elements barely from themselves can cause this, is an opinion more fitting for a Hog-herd than a Phylosopher, for whatsoever is begotten must have a matter to be begotten of, as well as something to beget it, and this matter must be proper to receive form, for man cannot make a Timber-log of a Turf, nor a Book of an Egg-shel, therefore this Matter must naturally be affected to suffer whatsoever form the Author pleaseth to give it: the Author of every Generation must be altogether active, not subject to any adverse principles, that so he may not run out of one thing into another before he hath finished, and this is proper to the Sun, Moon, and Stars: this will be denied by none that have lived a Rational Man but one Summer and one Winter, and felt a difference of heat and coldness, driuess and moisture, caused by the neerness and remoat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Sun, and seen the difference of springing, increasing and decaying of things upon Earth in those times, for when we see the Load-stone draws Iron, it shews plainly that Nature hath given it efficacy so to do; so when we see these things done by the Heavens, we must needs think Nature hath given the Heavens power to do so, and seeing those Qualities, Heat, Coldness, Dryness, and Moisture, are contrary the one to the other, of necessity sometimes the one must yeeld, and sometimes the other, and thence comes the Procreation, Corruption, and Vicissitude of things below; and seeing all likes rejoyce in their likes, and disagree with their dislikes, there must needs be something in the Heavens agreeable to all this, therefore some part of the Heavens is said to be Hot, some Cold, some Dry, and some moist, not because they are so in themselves, but because they work such effects in Elementary Bodies, as is evident to the experience of them that search after it.</p>
            <p>We have now shewed you what a Physitian ought to be in respect of Knowledg in the Celestial World: I shall only now show you in a word or two what knowledg he ought to have in the Elementary and Intellectual worlds, and that very briefly, and so conclude.</p>
            <p>As in the Celestial world he ought very carefully to heed the oppositions and great conjunctions of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, the Eclipses of the Luminaries, the Quarterly ingresses of the Sun and the Crisis of Diseases, so in the Elementary world he ought to heed the Seasons of the Year, whether they be hotter, colder, dryer, moister than they should be; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ought to be very well skilled in Vegetables and Minerals and how the Earth brings them forth, what is the Office of the <hi>Central Sun,</hi> and what is the office of the <hi>Celestial Sun,</hi> what is the office of the <hi>Central Moon,</hi> and what the office of the <hi>Celestial Moon</hi> in the production of things here below, and how, and by what Mediums they perform it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, In the Intellectual <hi>World,</hi> he ought to be very frequent, fearing God, and eschewing evil, for into his hands as the means, hath the eternal God of Heaven and Earth put the lives of those Christians whom, he loved so well that he redeemed them by the Blood of his only begotten Son: Let him be very studious in those great Books of God, the Book of the Scripture, and the <hi>Book of the Creatures,</hi> let the Glory of God, and the Good of the Creature be his whol Aim, neither let such a <hi>Monster</hi> as <hi>Covetousness</hi> have the least entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his heart; let him be no respecter of Persons, but go as willingly to the Poor for nothing, as to the Rich for a reward, Knowing, That he that giveth to the Poor, lendeth to the Lord, and he shall be sure to have a good Pay-master. To conclude, In all his practices let him consider what he would have another do to him if he were in like case, and do the like to them: and to them that follow this Rule, Peace shall be upon them, as upon the Israel of God.</p>

            <p>THe most usual Measures [amongst us] (quoth the <hi>Colledg)</hi> are these:</p>
            <p>A Spoon which in <hi>Syrups</hi> holds half an ounce, in <hi>distilled Waters</hi> three drachms.</p>
            <p>A Taster which holds an ounce and an half.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Congie</hi> which (in their former <hi>Dispensatory</hi> held nine pound, now) holds but eight pound; <hi>viz.</hi> just a Gallon: To miss but one Pint in a Gallon is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with a Colledg of Physitians, such Physitians as our times afford. The reason I suppose is, Because most Nations differ in the quantity of their Measures, and they quoted their <hi>Congius</hi> from one Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and from another now; for indeed their <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensatory</hi> is borrowed a great part of it from <hi>Arabia,</hi> part from <hi>Greece,</hi> some from <hi>France,</hi> some from <hi>Spain,</hi> and some from <hi>Italy,</hi> and now they vapor with it. Oh brave! should a man that borrowed his Cloathes from so many Broakers in <hi>Long-lane</hi> be proud of them?</p>
            <p>Besides these, they have gotten another antick way of <hi>MENSURATION</hi> which they have not set down here, <hi>viz.</hi> By Handfuls and Pugils. An Handful is as much as you can gripe in one Hand; and a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil as much as you can take up with your Thumb and two Fingers; and how much that is who can tell? Intruth this way of Mensuration is as certain as the Weather-cock, and as various as mens Fingers are in length, and the things taken up in driness or form; for an Handsul of green Herbs will not be half an Handsul or not above when they are dry: and your mother-wit will teach you that you may take up more Hay in this manner than Bran, and more Bran than Sand. And thus much for their <hi>Weights,</hi> and also for their <hi>Measures:</hi> both rediculous and contradictive.</p>

Diseases that lie in parts of the Body remot from the Stomach and Bowels, it is in vain to think to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away the cause at once, and therefore you had best do it by degrees; Pills, and such like Medicines which are hard in Body, are fittest for such a business, because they are longest before they digest.</item>

               <item>7. Observe this general Rule; That such Medicins as are hot in the first degree are most habitual to our Bodies, because they are just of the heat of our Blood.</item>

                  <list>
                     <item>1. Consider what the humor offending is, and let the Medicine be such as purgeth that humor, else will you weaken Nature, not the Disease.</item>
                     <item>2. Take notice, if the humor you would purge out be thin, then gentle Medicines will serve the turn, but if it be tough and viscous, take such Medicines as are cutting and opening the night before you would take the Purge.</item>
                     <item>3. In purging tough humors, sorbear as much as may be such Medicines as leave a binding quality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them.</item>
                     <item>4. Have a care of taking Purges when your Body is astringent; your best way, is first to open it by a Clyster.</item>
                     <item>5. In taking opening Medicines, you may safely take them at night, eating but a light supper three or four hours before, and the next morning drinking a draught of warm Posset-drink, and you need not fear to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your business. In this manner you may take <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive Electuary, Diacatholicon, Pulp of Cassia,</hi> and the like gentle Electuaries, as also all Pills that have neither <hi>Diagrydium</hi> nor <hi>Colocynthis</hi> in them. But all violent Purges require a due ordering of the Body, such ought to be taken in the morning after you are up, and not to sleep after them before they have done wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, at least before night; two hours after you have taken them, drink a draught of warm Posset-drink, or Broath, and six hours after eat a bit of Mutton, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten walking about the Chamber; let there be a good fire in the Chamber, and stir not out of the Chamber till the Purge have done working, or not till next day.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Lastly, Take sweating Medicines when you are in bed, covered warm, and in the time of your sweating drink Posset-drink as hot as you can drink it; if you sweat for a Feaver, boyl Sorrel and red Sage in your Posset-drink, sweat an hour or longer if your strength will permit, then (the chamber being kept very warm) shift your self all but your Head, about which (the Cap which you sweat in being still kept on) wrap a Napkin very hot, to repell the vapors back.</p>
            <p>I confess these, or many of these Directions may be found in one place of the Book or other, and I delight as little to write tautology as another, but the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter desiring they should be put here, and I considering it might make for the publick good, inserted them; if notwithstanding any will be so mad to do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a mischief, the fault is not mine.</p>

               <hi>BEfore I begin the Catalogue, I thought good to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise a few words to the Reader.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Let him have a care he mistake not one thing for another; <hi>viz.</hi> Herbs for Roots, or either of them for Flowers: If he cast but his eye up to the top of the Page he shall there see which it is.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let a due time be observed (cases of necessity excepted) in gathering all Simples; for which take these few Rules. The time to gather all roots is before the hearb run up to seed, for then they are softest, as you may see by Radishes, carrots, parsneps &amp;c. the roots of which, you may perceive hard when they run up to seed and not because the sap is then in the root, as the vulgar hold; for if the sap rose and fell as they hold, then the root must grow in winter only, as the branches do in Summer, which experience will shew to be falce; for the root grows only in Summer, as the branches doe; you see what a wooden Docter Tradition is: Would not this make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one endevour to Study a reason for what he doeth? and see how our forefathers have been lead by the noses by Tradition. The truth is, it is the Sun is the author of life and growth to the wholl Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was ordained of God for that end; when he comes on this side of the Equator, the trees spring, when he passeth to the south side of the Equator they loose their verdant color and growth also till the revolution of time bring his presence to revive them; but enough of this in this place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herbs are to be gathered when they are fullest of juyce which is, before thy run up to seed; and if you gather them in a hot sunshine day, they will not be so subject to putrifie: the best way to dry them, is in the Sun, according to <hi>Dr. REASON,</hi> though not according to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54721:9"/>
               <hi>Dr. TRADITION: Such Herbs as remaine green all the year, or are very full of juyce, it were a folly to dry at all, but gather them only for present use, as Housleek, Scurvy-grass &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let Flowers be gathered when they are in their prime, in a sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine day, and dried in the sun. Let the Seeds be perfectly ripe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be gathered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Let them be kept in a dry place; for any moisture, though it be but a moist air, corrupts them, which if perceived in time, the beams of the Sun will refresh the hearbs and flowers and do the Sun no harm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Take notice, that only the Latin Names, were quoted by the Colledg, &amp; are to beseen at the beginning of each Simple, in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Letter; the English Name, together with the Temperature, and Vertues, were added by the Translator for the publick good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. All the Latin Names to one Herb are not set down, most of which are superfluous, some ridiculons, some Idolatrous; as to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute one Herb, to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> another to <hi>St. Peter,</hi> and a third to <hi>St. Paul:</hi> Some blasphemous as to call one, <hi>the holy Ghost,</hi> another <hi>Allelujah,</hi> another, <hi>an Herb of the Trinity &amp;c.</hi> So in the Compositions, To call an Oyntment, the <hi>Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Apostles:</hi> to call one Plaister, <hi>Divine,</hi> another, <hi>Holy,</hi> a third, <hi>the grace of God.</hi> The Colledge might have been ashamed of it if they had ever come where shame grew: but,. 1. The Heathen they dedicated herbs and trees to their Gods. 2. the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists they must follow their patriarks and dedicate them to their Saints; Ours having not wit enough to find out a third, (for their wits were in print before they were born) they follow the Papists as their holy Fathers as in absconding their art so in their blasphemies, see how one sin ushers in another.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ACANTHI, Brancae Ursinae.</hi> Of Bears-breech, or Brank-ursine; it is meanly hot and dry, it helps ach and numness of the joynts, and is of a binding quality, good for wounds and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bones. <hi>Dioscorides</hi> saith, they are profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Ruptures, or such as are bursten, or burnt with fire, a drachm of the Root in Pouder being taken in the morning fasting, in a Decoction made with the same Root and Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Acori, Veri, Perigrini vulgaris, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Calamus Aromaticus.</hi> I shall not, nor dare not make a long Paraphrase about the sorts of it, one of which is Water-flag, or Flower-de-luce, which is hot and dry in the second degree, binds, strengthens, stops fluxes of the belly, and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate flowing of the terms in women, a drachm being taken in red wine every morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alljum.</hi> Garlick. It is hot and dry in the fourth degree, breeds naughty and corrupt blood, yet is an enemy to all Poysons, and such as are bitten by cold venemous beasts, <hi>viz.</hi> Adders, Toads, Spiders, &amp;c. it provokes urin, and expels wind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcannae.</hi> Of Privet. See the Leaves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Althaeae.</hi> Of Marshmallows: are meanly hot, of a digesting softning nature, ease pains, help bloody fluxes, the stone and gravel; being bruised and well boyled in Milk, and the Milk drunk, is a gallant Remedy for the gripings of the belly, and the Bloody flux: If a Feaver accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Disease, boyl a handful of common Mallow leaves with a handful of these Roots.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Angelicae.</hi> Of Angelica; is hot and dry in the third degree, strengthens the heart excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and is a singular remedy against pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and poyson, half a drachm taken in the morning fasting.</p>

                  <hi>Anchusae.</hi> Of Alkanet; cold and dry, bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, good for old Ulcers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anthorae.</hi> An outlandish root, the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyson for Monkshood, it is an admirable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for the wind-chollick, and resists poyson. They that would know more of it, let them reade <hi>Guainerius,</hi> and <hi>Solerius,</hi> both which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved neer the places where it plentifully grew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apii.</hi> Of Smallage. See the Barks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristolochiae.</hi> Of Birthwort: of which are three sorts, long, round, and climing: All hot and dry in the third degree.</p>
               <p>The long, being drunk in Wine, brings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way<note place="margin">Dioscori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> both birth and after-birth, and whatsoever a careless Midwife hath left behind.<note place="margin">Galen.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54721:10"/>The round, being drunk with Wine, helps (besides the former) stuffings of the lungues, hardness of the spleen, ruptures, convulsions; both of them resist poyson.</p>
               <p>I never read any use of the climing Birthwort. <hi>Artanitae, Cyclaminis, &amp;c,</hi> Of Sowbread: hot and dry in the third degree, a most violent purge, dangerous; outwardly applied to the place, it profits much in the bitings of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous beasts, also being hung about women in labor, it causeth speedy deliverance. See the Herb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arundinis, Vallatoriae, &amp; Saccharinae.</hi> Of common Reeds and sugar Reeds.

               </p>
               <p>I would not have the Reader build too much confidence upon the degrees of temperature (or more properly intemperature) neither of this, or any other Simple, because most of them are quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Outlandish Authors; and out of question the difference of the climate may somthing alter their temperature in degree.</p>
               <p>I never read any vertue of the Root of Sugar Cane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ari, &amp;c.</hi> Of Cuckow-pints, or Wake-Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, hot and dry in the third degree. I know no great good they do inwardly taken, unless to play the rogue withal, or make sport: outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied, they take off Scurf, Morphew, or Frec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles from the face, and cleer the skin, and case the pains of the Gout.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Asclepiadis, vincetoxici.</hi> Of Swallow-wort, hot and dry, good against poyson, and gripings of the belly, as also against the bitings of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogs, taken inwardly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Asari.</hi> Of Asarabacca: the Roots are a safer purge than the Leaves and not so violent, I do not much fancy any of them both, ignorant people had better let them alone than be too bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie with what they have no skill in: they purge by vomit, stool, and urine, they are profitable for such as have Agues, Dropsies, stoppings of the Liver, or Spleen, green sickness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Asparagi.</hi> Of Sparagus, or Sperage: they are temperate in quality, opening, they provoke urine, and cleanse the reins and bladder, being boyled in white wine, and the wine drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Asphodeli, Hastae Regiae, foem.</hi> Of Kings spear, or foemale Asphodel. I know no physical use of the Roots, probably there is: for I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve God created any thing of no use.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Asphodeli, Albuci, maris,</hi> of male Asphodel. Hot and and dry in the second degree. Inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, they provoke vomit, urine, and the terms in women: outwardly used in Oyntments, they cause hair to grow, clense Ulcers, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Morphew and Freckles from the face.</p>

It expels wind, easeth pains of the teeth, strengthens the back, helps the running of the reins, and the whites in women, being taken inwardly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behen. alb. rub.</hi> Of Valerian, white and red. <hi>Mesue, Serapio</hi> and other Arabians say they are hot and moist, in the latter end of the first, or beginning of the second degree, and comfort the heart, stir up lust.

The red Beet root boyled and preserved in Vinegar, makes a fine cool, pleasing, clensing, digesting sawce. See the Leaves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bistortae &amp;c.</hi> Of Bistort, or Snakeweed, cold and dry in the third degree, binding, the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of half a dram at a time taken inwardly, resist pestilence and poyson, helps ruptures, and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, staies fluxes, vomiting, and immoderate flowing of the terms in women, helps inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and soreness of the mouth, and fastens loose teeth, being bruised and boyled in white Wine and the mouth washed with it.</p>

                  <hi>Brionae &amp;c.</hi> Of Briony both white and black, they are both hot and dry, some say in the third degree, and some say, but in the first: they purge flegm and watry humors, but they trouble the stomach much, they are very good for dropsies; the white is most in use, and is admirable good for the fits of the Mother; both of them externally used, take away Freckles, Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning and Morphew from the face, and clense filthy Ulcers: It is but a churlish purge, but being let alone, can do no harm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Buglossi.</hi> Of Bugloss: Its vertues are the same with Borrage, and the Roots of either sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom used.</p>

It is very good applied to the navils of Children that stick out, Ruptures; held in the mouth, it is a present Remedy for the fits of the Mother; it being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken inwardly, gives speedy deliverance to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in travail, and brings away the after-birth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poeoniae, maris, foemellae.</hi> Of Peony, male, and foemale. They are meanly hot, but more drying, the male is more effectual in operation than the foemale (say Authors) and yet quoth Dr. <hi>Reason,</hi> why should not the male be best for men, and the foemale for women? The Root helps women not sufficiently purged after tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, it provokes the Terms, and helps pains in the Belly, as also in the Reins and Bladder, Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-sickness, and Convulsions in children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either taken inwardly or hung about their necks. You may take half a drachm at a time, and less for children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phu, Valerinae, majoris, minoris.</hi> Valerian, or Setwal, greater and lesser. They are tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately hot, the greater provoke Urine and the Terms, helps the Strangury, staies Rhewms in the Head, and takes away the pricking pains thereof. The lesser resists Poyson, asswageth the swelling of the Cods, coming either through wind or cold, helps cold taken after sweating or labor, Wind Chollick; outwardly it draws out thorns, and cures both Wounds and Ulcers.</p>

                  <hi>Plantaginis.</hi> Of Plantane. The Root is somthing dryer than the Leaf, but not so cold, it opens stoppages of the Liver, helps the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and Ulcers of the Reins and Bladder. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scorides</hi> affirmeth that one Root helpeth a Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian Ague, three a Tertain, and four a Quartan, which though our late writers hold to be fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, yet there may be a greater truth in it than they are aware of; yet I am as loth to make Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition a foundation to build on as any of them, let Experience be Judg, and then we weigh not modern Jury Men. A little bit of the Root being eaten, instantly staies pains in the Head, even to admiration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polypodij.</hi> Of Polypodium, or Fearn of the Oak. It is a gallant, though gentle purger of Melancholly; Also in the opinion of <hi>Mesue</hi> (as famous a Physitian as ever I read for a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenist) it dries up superfluous Humors, takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way swellings from the hands, feet, knees, and joynts, stitches, and pains in the sides, infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Spleen, Rickets: correct it with a few Annis seeds, or Fennel seeds, or a little Ginger, and then the stomach will not loath it. Your best way of taking it, is to bruise it well, and boyl it in white Wine till half be consumed, you may put in much, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

none at all; or if it did, the reason were as far to seek. I am of opinion, that which grows on the ground is the best to evacuate Melancholly, but it is more Sympathetical.</p>

Let it be no dishonor to <hi>Galen</hi> nor <hi>Dioscorides</hi> that English men have found out in late daies that these Roots may safely be given inwardly; Intruth they may be excused if the difference of the climates they and we lived, and now live in, be but considered, neither I hope will my Country men blame me for follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing only Dr. <hi>Experience</hi> in the vertues of this Root: stamped and boyled in Wine it speedily helps (being drunk I mean, for it will not do the deed by looking upon it) all broken bones, it is of an incredible vertue that way; as also being stamped and applyed to the place it soon heals all Wounds, and quickly takes away the black and blew marks of blows, being bruised and applied to the place, and for these, I am perswaded there is not a better Medicine under the Sun (or as <hi>Copernicus</hi> and <hi>Kipler</hi> will have it above the Sun.)</p>

It gently purgeth Choller from the stomach and liver, opens stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, withstands the Dropsie, Hypocondriack Melancholly, a little boyling takes away the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of it, and therefore it is best given by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion only; If your body be any thing strong you may take two drams of it at a time being slised thin and steeped all night in white Wine, in the morning strain it out and drink the white Wine; it purgeth but gently, it leaves a binding quality behind it, therefore dryed a little by the fire and beaten into pouder, it is usually given in Fluxes.</p>

                  <hi>Rhaphani, Domesticae &amp; sylvestris.</hi> Of Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, Garden and Wild.

In this were <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Dioscorides</hi> quite beside the cushion, in saying this root was opening, and clensing, when clean contrary; it is both drying and binding, yet not without some opening quality, for it helps the Yellow Jaundice, and therefore opens the obstructions of the Liver and Gall; it is given with good success to such as have had bruises by falls, stops Loosness, the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids, and the Terms in women.</p>

Take notice here, That the Barks both of this Root, as also of Parsly, Fennel &amp;c. is all that of the root which is in use, neither can it properly be called Bark, for it is all the Root, the hard pith in the middle excepted, which is alwaies thrown away, when the roots are used. It is something hotter and drier than Parsly, and more medicinal; it opens stoppings, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes urin, helps digestion, expels wind, and warms a cold stomach: use them like Grass Roots.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Avellanarum.</hi> Of Hazel. The rind of the tree provokes Urine, breaks the Stone; the husks anp shels of the Nuts, dried and given in pouder, stay the immoderat flux of the terms in women.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aurantiorum.</hi> Of Orrenges. Both these, and also Lemmons and Citrons, are of different qualities, the outward bark, <hi>viz.</hi> what looks red, is hot and dry, the white is cold and moist, the juyce colder than it, the seeds hot and dry; the outward bark is that which here I am to speak to, it is somewhat hotter than that either of Lemmons or Citrons, therefore it warms a cold stomach more, and expels wind better, but it strengthens not the heart so much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Berber &amp;c.</hi> Barberries.

                  <hi>Cinnamomum.</hi> Cinnamom, and Cassia Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnea. Are hot and dry in the second degree, strengthens the stomach, helps digestion, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a sweet breath, resists poyson, provokes u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin, and the terms, causeth speedy delivety to women in travel, helps Coughs and Defluxions of humors upon the Lungs, Dropsies, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Urin. In Ointments it takes away red pimples, and the like deformities from the face. There is scarce a better remedy for women in labor, than a drachm of Cinnamon newly bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into pouder and taken in white Wine.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Red Corral, is cold, dry and binding, stops the immoderate flowing of the terms, bloody-fluxes, the running of the reins, and the whites in women, helps such as spit and pisse blood, helps witchcraft being carried about one, it is an approved remedy for the falling sickness. Also if ten grains of red Corral be given to a Child in a little breast-milk so soon as it is born, before it take any other food, it will never have the falling sickness, nor convulsions. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon dose is from ten grains to thirty.</p>
               <p>Pearls, are a wonderfull strengthner to the heart, encrease milk in Nurses, and amend it being naught, they restore such as are in Consumptions, both they and the red Corral preserve the body in health, and resist feavers. The Dose is ten grains or fewer; more I suppose because it is dear, than because it would do harm.</p>

               <p>For my own particular I aim solely at the benefit of my country in what I do, and shall impartially reveal to them what the Lord hath revealed to me in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick: I see my first labours were so well accepted, that I shall not now give over till I have given my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that which is called the whol body of Physick, in their own mother tongue; I waigh the ill language of the Colledg no more than I do a straw under my foot; Wisdom will be justified of all her children: only I desire them not to grow to proud, but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber who it was said, <hi>Pride goes before a fall, and a haughty mind before destruction.</hi>

                     <p>Wormwood; Garlick; Dill; Smallage; Chamomel; Epithimum; Fennel; Juniper, Marjoram; Origanum; Savory, both winter and summer; and that, I am of opinion, was the reason in ancient times, women al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies boyled Savory with their beans and pease, <hi>viz.</hi> to expel the windiness of them; it was a good fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore I would not have it left: however this shews that in ancient times, people were more studious in the nature of Simples, or at the least Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians were more honest, I mean more free in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting their knowledg for the benefit of the vulgar; at last Honesty began to leave the Earth, and then Ignorance quickly stepping up in the place of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, people used them a while for custom sake, at last they were esteemed superstitious, and quite left off.</p>
                     <p>I care not greatly, now I am at it, if I quote one more of like nature (I am confident, were it my present scope, I could quote an hundred) and that is Tansy.</p>
                     <p>Tansie is excellent good to clense the stomach and bowels of tough viscous flegm, and humors that stick to them, which the flegmatick constitution of the Winter usually infects the body of man with, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions gouts and other diseases of like nature, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting long; this was the original of that custom to eat Tansies in the Spring, which afterwards grew to be superstitious, and apropriated only to some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain daies, as <hi>Palm-Sundaies &amp;c.</hi> and so at last the evils of observing daies being known, and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the meat absconded, it is quite almost left off. For my part, if any think it superstitious to eat a Tansie in the Spring, I shall not burden their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, they may make the Herb into a Conserve with Sugar, or boyl it in Wine and drink the Decoction, or make the Juyce into a Syrup with Sugar, which they will.

                     <p>As for the vertues of the flowers, there were but few quoted before, and those very briefly; I think the reason was, because the Printer was afraid the book would be too big: I shall therefore give a supply here, to what was wanting there, and where I was too briefe there, I shall be more large here.</p>
                     <p>The Flowers of Ox-eye, being boyled into a pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, with a little barly meal, take away swellings, and hardness of the flesh, being applied warm to the place.</p>
                     <p>Chamomel flowers heat, discuss, Loosen, and rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, boyled in Clisters, they are excellent in the wind chollick, boyled in Wine, and the decoction drunk, purgeth the reins, breaks the stone, opens the pores, casts out chollerick humors, succors the heart, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth pains and aches, or stiffness coming by travai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                     <p>The flowers of Rocket used outwardly, discuss, swellings, and dissolve hard tumors, you may boyl them into a pultis, or Cataplasme, as Scholers cal it, But inwardly taken, they send but unwholsom vapors up to the head.</p>
                     <p>Hops open obstruction of the bowels, Liver, and spleen, they clense the body of Choller and flegm, provoke urine. I wonder in my heart how that apish fashion of drinking Beer and Ale together for the stone, came up, and others affirm that the disease of the stone, was not in <hi>rerum naturam,</hi> before Beer was invented, a gross untruth: for Physitians have written of the stone, that lived a thousand years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Beer was invented. I deny not but staleness of Beer, may cause sharpness of urine, otherwise Beer, if mild, is ten times better drink for such as are troubled with the stone, than Ale, as being more opening.</p>
                     <p>Jasmine flowers boyled in Oyl, and the greived place bathed with it, takes away cramps, and stiches in the sides: The plant is only preserved here in the gardens of some few, and because hard to come by, I pass it; If you desire more vertues of it, be pleased to search it in <hi>Dodonoeus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The flowers of Woodbine, or Honey-suckles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dryed, and beaten into pouder, and a drachm, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in white Wine in the morning, helps the rickets, difficulty of breathing, provoke urine, and help such as cannot make water: I would have none make a common practice of taking it, for it clenseth the uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery vessels, so potently that it may cause pissing of blood.</p>
                     <p>The flowers of Mallows, being bruised, and boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in hony (two ounces of the flowers is sufficient for a pound of hony, and having first clarified the honey, before you put them in) then strained out, this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney taken with a Liquoris stick, is an eccellent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy both for Coughs, Astmaes, and cansumptions of the Lungues.</p>

                     <p>Caranna outwardly applied, is excellent for aches, and swellings in the nerves and joynts; If you lay it behind the ears, it draws back humors from the eyes, applied to the temples as they usually do Mastich, it helps the tooth-ach.</p>

Chuse the dryest, and whitest, it is a very gentle purger of choller, quencheth thirst, provokes appetite, easeth the roughness of the throat, helps bitterness in the throat, and often proness to vomit; It is very good for such as are subject to be costive to put into their drinks in stead of Sugar, it hath no obnoxious quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at al in it, but may be taken by a woman with child, without any danger, a child of a year old may take an ounce of it at a time, dissolved in milk, it wil melt like Sugar, neither wil it be known from it by the tast.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> It clenseth the body of venemous humors, as Boyls, Carbuncles, and the like; it prevails against pestilential Feavers, it strengthens the heart and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive vertue, purgeth by stool and urine, it makes a man have a good stomach to his meat, and provokes sleep.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> But by my Authors leave, I never accounted purges to be proper Physick in Pestilential Feavers; this I beleeve, the syrup clenseth the liver well, and is exceeding good for such as are troubled with Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condriack Melancholly. The strong may take two ounces at a time, the weak one; or you may mix an ounce of it with the Decoction of Senna.</p>

I will not say they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to kill men <hi>cum privilegio,</hi> that's too gross; I charibly judg thus, They fearing their monopoly would not hold as being built upon a rotten foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, intended when it failed to turn Horse-Doctors, and so provided this Receipt against a wet day, For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Either the vertue of the Hellobore will fly away in such a martyrdom, or else it will remain in the Decoction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If it evaporate away, then is the Medicine like themselves good for nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If it remain in, it is enough to spoil the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest man breathing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. Because it is too strong.</p>
                  <p>A 2. Because it is not corrected in the least, and because they have not corrected that, therefore I take leave to correct them.</p>

               <p>A. 3. It is usually made, in respect of body, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thicker than new Honey.</p>

I would advise the unskilful not to meddle with it inwardly: You may give half an ounce of it in Clysters, in melancholly diseases, which commonly have astringency a constant compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them.</p>

               <p>BEfore I begin with their Oyls, Oyntments, and Plaisters, give me leave to swerve a little from the Colledges mode, they swerve ten times more from the truth: I would but give a few Rules for the Use of them, and I had as good do it here as any where: and to write but the truth, many City Chyrurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that I have talked with, are scarce able to give reason for what they do; 'tis to be feared, that those that live in the country far remote, are far less able: to do all these a curtesy, do I candidly deliver these Rules, and let me never be acconnted so basely bred, as to forget those kind Ladies and Gentlewomen that for Gods sake help their poor wounded neighbors, the great God reward them with a plentiful increase of estate in this world, and eternal Beatitude in that to come.</p>
               <p>The cheifest of all these, Chyrurgicall Antidota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I shall divide into these twelve Chapters, which shall be treated of in this order.</p>

                  <p>SUch Oyls, Oyntments, and Plaisters, as ease pain are called by Physitians (because you should not know what they mean) <hi>Anodines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All pain is caused by heat, or driness, or both, for moisture seldom, unless heat be joyned with it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth pain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anodines,</hi> also some divide into proper and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, improper <hi>Anodines,</hi> (if a man may call them <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodines)</hi> they call <hi>Narcoticks,</hi> for I assure you if crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed words would cure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, our Physitians would come behind none in the world: the truth is, these words were borrowed from <hi>Galen,</hi> and are Greek words, and <hi>Galen</hi> writing in his mother tongue, they were understood well enough there; ours retain the same words, only to blind peoples eyes, that so they may not prie into the Mystery of their Monopoly, for then all the fat were in the fire. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                  <p>Proper <hi>Anodines</hi> are either temperately hot or temperately cold.</p>
                  <p>Hot <hi>Anodines</hi> are</p>
                  <p>Oyl of sweet Almonds, Linseed Oyl, Oyl of Eggs, Oyl of Saint Johns-wort, Hen-grease, Ducks grease, Goose grease, Chamomel, Melilot, Fenugreek seeds, Dill, Bay leaves and berries, Juniper berries, Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, Oyles and Ointments made of them; Oyle of Earth-worms Oyle of Elder, Wax, Turpentine, Oyntment of Marshmallows, <hi>Martiatum, Arregon, Resumptivum, Oxycroceum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any external part of your body be pained, these, or any of these made into fomentations, to both the part pained, or into pultifses, or Oyls, or Oyntments by adding Hogs grease, or Plaisters, by adding Wax, or Rozin, or both to the Oyntment; and applyiug it to the place, ease pain.</p>
                  <p>But if together with the pain there be an inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then <hi>Anodines</hi> of a cooler nature are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, such be Oyl Omphacine, <hi>viz.</hi> Oyl of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives pressed from them before they be ripe, Poppies, Roses, Violets, Pellitory of the wall, Flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort: these, or any of these made into Pultisses, Oyls, Oyntments, or Plaisters, Oyntment of Roses, <hi>Unguantnm Album, Populeon, Refrigerans, Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Improper <hi>Anodines,</hi> or <hi>Narcoticks</hi> which you please, are Medicines of another nature, and (you may thank the Colledge of Physitians, for training you up in such ignorance) scarce fit for a vulgar use, till they have learn'd more skill in Physick than yet they have; yet be pleased to consider, that in taking away pains, three things are to be considered; The cause, the pain, the part pained. To these are medicines apropriated, for some take away the cause, but these belong not to my present scope; others take away the pain, and meddle not with the cause, as those proper <hi>Anodines</hi> I mentioned before: and some take away neither cause nor pain, but only stupifie the sences, that so it cannot be felt: these are to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with abundance of skill and discretion, and never but in cases of necessity, when the pain is so vehement that Nature is not able to bear it, or a Feaver thereby threatned. Of this Nature, and for this use are <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of these some are Simple; As,</p>
                  <p>Mandrakes, Henbane, Poppies, Opium, Lettice, Sengreen, Nightshade, Camphire, Hemlock, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>TEe use of Emollients, is to soften hard places, and bring them to their pristine estate, of which we spake more at large in the Simples.</p>

                  <p>Those are common, whose general operation is to soften hard swellings, and such parts and places of the body, as are hardened by Congralation.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To proceed, consider that Emollients are more temperate than Attractives, but less temperate than Suppuratives; of which more in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>Also take notice that if the tumor be in any princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of the body, mix your Emollients with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringents.</p>

A man shall never know any thing of the mysteries of his Creator, till he knows himself: and he shall never know himself, First, Till he hath the honesty freely to impart to others, what God hath freely revealed to him for the publick good; Secondly, Till he hath the Discretion to impart every thing in its due season.

                  <p>They must all be dry, yet so as there must not be a difference in their driness, for if the ulcer happen in a dry part of the body, the Sarcotick must be very dry, and therefore some of them are drying even to the fourth degree: but if the part of the body where they happen be moist, you must use Incarnatives, (or Sarcoticks which you please to call them by) that are less drying.</p>

                  <p>THese the Greeks call <hi>Epilotica,</hi> the Latins, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrizantes,</hi> and we in English Scarrifying medicines, though the greater half of the nation know not what the word [Scarrifying] means.</p>
                  <p>Therefore take notice that a Scarrifying medicine, is such a medicine as cloaths a place again with skin, when the skin is off, and this it doth by a drying and binding quality.</p>
                  <p>Of these some are Simples, some Compounds.</p>
                  <p>Simples are,</p>
                  <p>Galls, Spunge burnt, Litharge, terra Sigillata, or Lemnia, Pomegranate Pills, or Flowers, Aloes, Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia Lignea, Pompholix, Spodium, Cypress Nuts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>THe Greeks call Aglutinative medicines, <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitica,</hi> and that's the reason Comfry is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Symphitum,</hi> because of its Glutenous quallity.</p>
                  <p>The meaning of the word [Aglutinative] is best known by its use, which is to dry up that humidity, that is between the lips of a wound, that so it may be healed.</p>
                  <p>They are all usually drying in the second degree</p>
                  <p>Aglutinatives Simple are,</p>
                  <p>Mastich, Sarcocolla, Frankincense, Mirrh, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonia, Bole Armenick, Dragons blood, <hi>terra Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> Saint Johns-wort, Rosemarry flowers, Knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grass, Comfry, Marjoram, Gum Tragacanth, Gum of Ivy, Gum Elemni, red Wine, Vervain, Yarrow, wild Tansy, Cranebil, Sanicle, Cobwebs, Horse tail, Sinkfoyl.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And now by comparing these with the Scarrifying medicines, you may see that they are as like, as one eg is like another: and what a multitude of rules Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have imposed upon you, that so they might make their way difficult to you.</p>

                     <p>Culpeper] A. That most of these Oyls if not all of them, are used only externally, is certain; and as certain that they retain the vertues of the Simples whereof they are made; therefore the ingenious might help themselves. But because we live in a fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid age, I shall vouchsafe to quote the Vertues of the chiefest of them.</p>

                  <p>Culpeper] A. I Desire you to take notice before I begin, that Chymical Oyls gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are not to be taken alone by themselves by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their vehement heat and burning, but mixed with other convenient medicines.</p>
                  <p>A. 2. They carry the very same vertues the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples do, but are far more prevalent, as having far more spirit in them and far less earthly dross.</p>
                  <p>A. 3. The generall way of taking them, is to drop two or three drops of them in any convenient liquor or other medicine, which the last Table will fit you with, and so take it; for some of them are so hot (as Oyl of Cinnamon) that two or three drops will make a dish of pottage so hot of the Simple that you can hardly eat them.</p>

                     <p>Culpeper.] A. Your best way to learn to still Chymical Oyls, is to learn of an Alchymist: for I rest confident the greatest part of the Colledg had no more skill in Chymistry than I have in building hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but having found out certain models in old ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty Authors, tell people S O they must be done. I can teach a man S O, how to build a house: first he may lay the foundation, then rear up the sides, then joyn the rafters, then build the Chimneyes, tile the top, and plaister the walls; but how to do one jot of this I know not: And so play the Colledg here: for the Alchymists have a better way by far to draw them: the truth is, I am in a manner tied to their method here, from which I may not step aside; if my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try kindly accept this, (which is the beginning of my labors) I may happily put forth something else for the Ingenious to whet their wits upon; Only here I quote the Oyls in the Colledg order, and then quote the vertue of the chiefst of them, that so the Reader may know by a penny how a shilling is coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>

I have taken up this World as Travellers takes up an Inn, not as a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder takes a Dwelling: I take no care for Victuals before I am hungry, nor new Cloathes before my old lack mending. I have read in some Authors that <hi>Mammon</hi> which signifies <hi>Covetousness</hi> is the master Devil over those that tempt men to sin, and I partly beleeve it: I have read also in <hi>Hosea,</hi> 4. 12. That those that make the Earth their happiness, go a whoring from under their God, which made me terribly afraid, lest in one act, I should commit two evils, forsake the fountain of Living-waters, and buy my self a Cestern that would hold none.

There was a tale lately told me of a Lady of a great estate, that was so extream foolish, that she would ride in the Coach-box and drive the Horses, whilst the Coach-man rid in the Coach: you think this was a great mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; yet a greater madness by odds it is, for a man that is Heir to an Eternal Being to make himself a slave to the Earth, which must perish: I will assure you it was a higher principle than all these, moved me to write, <hi>viz.</hi> Pure love to that Nation in which I was born and bred; of which I may justly say, If the Spirit of God said Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael was destroyed for want of knowledg when sin reigned but single, how much more this Nation when it reigns by troops?

               <p>But that these may appear as cleer as the Sun when he is upon the Meridian, I shall treat of them seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and in this order.</p>

                  <head>Of Medicines Temperate.</head>
                  <p>IF the world be composed of Extreams, then it acts by Extreams, for as the man is, so is his work: therefore it is impossible that any Medicine can be temperate, but may be reduced to Heat, Cold, Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or Moisture, and must operate (I mean such as operate by manifest quality) by one of these, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no other to operate by, and that there should be such a temperate mixture, so exquisitely of these qualities in any Medicine, that one of them should not manifestly excel the other, I doubt it is a Systeme too rare to find.</p>
                  <p>Thus then I conclude the matter to be, Those Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are called Temperate (not because they have no excess of Temperature at all in them) which can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be said, to heat nor cool so much as wil amount to the first degree of excess, for daily experience witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that they being added to Medicines, change not their qualities, they make them neither hotter nor colder.</p>
                  <p>They are used in such Diseases where there is no<note place="margin">Their Vse.</note> manifest distemper of the first qualities, <hi>viz.</hi> Heat and Cold, for example, In obstructions of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, where cold Medicines might make the Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction greater, and hot Medicines cause a Feaver.</p>
                  <p>In Feavers of Flegm, where the cause is cold and moist, and the effect hot and dry, in such use, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Medicines, which may neither encrease the Feaver by their heat, nor condensate the Flegm by their coldness.</p>
                  <p>Besides, Because Contraries are taken away by their Contraries, and every Like maintained by its Like, They are of great use, to preserve the constituion of the Body temperate, and the Body it self in strength and vigor, and may be used without danger, or fear of danger, by considering what part of the Body is weak, and vsing such temperate Medicines as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to that part.</p>

                  <p>THe care of the Ancient Physitians was such that they did not labor to hide from, but impart to posterity, not only the temperature of Medicines in general, but also their degrees in temperature, that so the distempered part may be brought to its tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, and no further; for all things which are of a<note place="margin">Galen. de simp. med. sacul. lib. 3 cap. 12.</note> contrary temperature, conduce not to cure, but the strength of the contrariety must be observed, that so the Medicine may be neither weaker nor stronger, than just to take away the distemper; for if the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper be but meanly hot, and you apply a Medicine cold in the Fourth Degree, 'tis true you may soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move that distemper of Heat, and bring another of Cold twice as bad.</p>
                  <p>Then Secondly, Not only the distemper it self, but also the part of the body distempered must be heeded, for if the Head be distempered by Heat, and you give such Medicines as cool the Heart or Liver you will bring another Disease and not cure the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                  <p>The Degrees then of Temperature are to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently heeded, which ancient Physitians have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be Four, in the first qualities, <hi>viz.</hi> Heat and Cold, of each of which we shall speak a word or two severally.</p>

                  <head>Of Medicines Hot in the first Degree.</head>
                  <p>THose are said to be hot in the first Degree which induce a Moderate and Natural heat to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and to the Parts thereof, either cold by Nature, or cooled by accedent, by which Natural heat is cherished when weak, or restored when want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>The first Effect then of Medicines hot in the first<note place="margin">Effect. 1.</note> Degree is, by their sweat and temperate heat, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Body to its natural heat, as the fire doth the external parts in cold weather, unless the affliction of cold be so great that such mild Medicines will not serve the turn</p>
                  <p>The Second Effect is, The Mitigation of pain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising<note place="margin">Effect. 2.</note> from such a distemper, and indeed this effect hath other Medicines, some that are cold, and some that are hotter than the first degree, they being rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally applyed to the distemper, these Medicines the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">

hot in the first degree, make the offending humors thin &amp; expel them by sweat, or insensible transpiration, and these of all other are most congruous or agreeable to the Body of Man, for there is no such equal tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of heat and cold in a sound Man, but heat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, for we live by heat and moisture, and not by cold.</p>
                  <p>Medicines then which are hot in the first degree, are such as just correspond to the Natural heat of our Bodies; such as are hotter or colder, are more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to do mischeif, being administred by an unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hand, than these are, because of their contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety to Nature; whereas these are gratefull to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by their moderate heat.</p>

                  <p>Yet may discommodities arise by heedless giving<note place="margin">Discomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</note> even of these, which I would have young Students in Physick to be very careful in, lest they do more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif than they are aware of, <hi>viz.</hi> It is possible by too much use of them, to consume not only what is inimical in the Body, but also the substance it self, and the strength of the spirits, whence comes fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and sometimes death: Besides, by applying them to the parts of the Body they are not apropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, or by not heeding well the complexion of the Patient, or the Natural temper of the part of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy afflicted, for the Heart is hot, but the Brain tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Medicines hot in the first Degree, cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">Effect. 4.</note> heat in the internall parts, help Concoction, breed good Blood, and keep it in good temper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bred.</p>

                  <p>Their Use is for such whose Stomach is filled with<note place="margin">Vse.</note> moisture, because their faculty is to heat, and dry, they take away obstructions or stoppings, open the pores of the skin, but not in the same manner that such do as are hot in the First Degree, for they do it without force, by a gentle heat, concocting, and expelling the humors, by strengthening and helping Nature in the work, but these cut tough humors, and scatter them by their own force and power when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot.</p>

                  <p>The giving then of cold Medicines, to a Man in his Natural temper, the season of the year also being but moderately hot, extinguisheth Natural heat in the Body of Man.</p>
                  <p>Yet have these a necessary Use in them too, though not so frequent as Hot Medicines have; and that may be the reason why an All-wise God hath furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with far more Hot Herbs and Plants &amp;c. than Cold.</p>
                  <p>Their Use is first, In Nourishments, that so the<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> heat of Food may be qualified, and made fit for a weak Stomach to digest, and therefore are Sallets u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Summer.</p>

               <p>Others hold them to be apropriated to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar parts of the Body by an hidden property as they call it, because their ignorance in Astronomy knew not what to make of it, or how the Midicines opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and their experience testifying that they had dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inct operations upon distinct parts of the Body.</p>
               <p>Others have labored to find out a middle way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both these, and they hold that what Medicines strengthen one part of the Body, must needs in some measure strengthen all the rest, yet so as that it is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly apropriated to that Part of the Body which it strengthens, and their reason is, Because the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Medicine agrees with the substance of that Part of the Body which it strengthens, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one almost that hath but wit enough to eat an Eg, knows that the substance of all Parts of the Body are not alike. This argument hath some weight in it, though in my Opinion it falls a little too low, for it is a certain truth, the Sympathy, and Antipathy in the Creation is the cause both of all Diseases, and also of the operations of all Medicines, However I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertex my Opinion of what Physitians call [hidden Qualities] now and then with it, yet my scope shall be to treat chiefly of this at this time, till time and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertunity (together with the will of my Creator) give me leave to digest what they call [hidden Qualities] into such a form that others may understand it as well as my self: I am sickly and have no body to help me, I can do things no faster than I can.</p>
               <p>That the Qualities and Use of these Medicines may be found out, and understood by every one, and so my Country reap the benefit of my Labor, they shall find them presented to their view in this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

                  <p>For what Medicines are apropriated to an unruly Tongue, is not in my power at present to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.</p>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Of Medicines apropriated to the Brain.</head>
                     <p>BEfore we treat of Medicines apropriated to the Brain, it is requisite that we discribe what the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and affection of the Brain is.</p>
                     <p>The Brain which is the Seat of Apprehension Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Memory, the Original of Sence and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is by nature temperate, and if so, then you will grant me that it may easily be afflicted both by Heat and Cold, and it is indeed more subject to affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions by either of them, than any other part of the Body, for if it be afflicted by heat, Sence and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is immoderately moved, if by cold, they languish,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:54721:93"/>
and are dulled, to pass by other symptoms which invade the Head, if the Brain be altered from its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per temper.</p>
                     <p>Also this is peculiar to the Brain, that it is deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or offended by sinels, sights, and sounds, but I shall meddle no further with these here, because they are not Medicines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cephalical</hi> Medicines may be found out from the Affections of the Brain it self. The Brain is usually oppressed with moisture in such afflictions; therefore give such Medicines as very gently, warm, clense, cut, and dry; but withal, let them be such as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Head, such as Physitians say [by an hidden quality] strengthens the Brain.</p>
                     <p>Again, if you consider the scituation of the Brain, you shal find it placed in the highest part of all the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; therefore it is easily afflicted with hot vapors, this punisheth a man with watchings and head-ach, as the former did with sottishness and sleepiness; in such cases use such <hi>Cephalects</hi> as gently cool the Brain.</p>
                     <p>To make <hi>Cephalects</hi> of <hi>Narcoticks,</hi> or slupifying Medicines is not my iutent, for I am confident they are inimical both to Brain and Sences. Of these, and such Medicines also as purge the Brain, I shall speak by and by. To return to my purpose.</p>
                     <p>Some Cephalicks purge the Brain, some heat it, some cool it, some strengthen it; but how they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this Office peculiarly to the Brain, most Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians confess they could neither comprehend by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor discribe by Precepts, only thus, they do it by an hidden quality, either by strengthening the Brain, thereby defending it from Diseases, or by a certain Antipathy between them and the Diseases in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the Brain.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, For the Use of Cephalicks, observe, if the Brain be much afflicted, you cannot well strengthen it before you have purged it, neither can you well purge the Brain before you have clensed the rest of the Body, it is so subject to receive the vapors up to it; give cooling Cephalicks when the Brain is too hot, and hot Cephalicks, when it is too cold.</p>
                     <p>Beware of using cooling Medicines to the Brain when the Crisis of a Disease is neer: How that time may be known, I shall (God asisting me) instruct you hereafter, I cannot do all things at one time; let it suffice now, that according as the Discase afflicting your Head is, so let your remedy be.</p>

                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Of Medicines apropriated to the Eyes.</head>
                     <p>TAke such Medicines as are apropriated to the Eyes under the name of [<hi>Ocular Medicines]</hi> I do it partly to avoid multiplicity of words, and partly to instruct my Country Men in the Terms of Art belonging to Physick, (I would have called them [<hi>Ophthalmicks]</hi> had not the word been troublesom to the reading, much more to the understanding of a Country man) as I even now called such Medicines [<hi>Cephalicks]</hi> as were apropriated to the Brain.</p>
                     <p>Ocular Medicines are two fold, <hi>viz.</hi> such as are referred to the Visive Vertues, and such as are referred to the Eyes themselves.</p>
                     <p>Such as strengthen the Visive Vertue or the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Nerves which convey it to the Eyes (say Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors) do it by an hidden Vertue, into the reason of which no man can dive, unless they should fetch it from the Similitude of the substance; And yet they say a Goats Liver conduceth much to make one see in the night, and they give this Reason, Because Goats see as well in the night as in the day. Yet is there no affinity in temperature nor substance between the Liver and the Eyes; However Astrologers know wel enough that all Herbs, Plants, &amp;c. That are under the Dominion of either Sun or Moon, and apropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the Head, be they hot or cold they strengthen the Visive Vertue, as Eyebright which is hot, <hi>Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> or Moonwort which is cold.</p>
                     <p>As for what appertains to the constitution of the Eyes themselves seeing they are exact in sence, they will not indure the least inconvenience, therefore such Medicines as are outwardly applied to them (for such Medicines as strengthen the visive Veertues are all gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven inwardly) let them neither hurt by their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness nor gnawing quality, nor be so tough that they should stick to them, Therefore let Oculiar Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines be neither in Pouders nor Ointments, because Oyl it self is offensive to the Eyes, and how pleasing Pouders are to them you may perceive your self by but going into the dust.</p>

                     <p>APPly no stinking Medicine to a Disease in the Nose, for such offend not only the Nose, but also the Brain; neither administer Medicines of any ill tast to a Disease in the Mouth, for that subverts the Stomach, because the tunicle of the mouth and of the Stomach is the same; And because both Mouth and Nostrils are wayes by which the Brain is clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, therefore are they infected with such vices as need almost continual clensing; and let the Medicines you apply to them be either pleasant, or at least, not ingrateful.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. 2. <hi>Of Medicines apropriated to the Breast and Lungues.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe Medicines apropriated to the Breast and Lungues, you shall find called all along by the name of [<hi>Pectorals]</hi> that's the term Physitians give them, when you hear them talk of Pectural Syrups, Pectoral Rowls, or Pectoral Oyntments, now you know their Use.</p>
                  <p>They are divers, some of which regard the part afflicted, others the matter afflicting.</p>
                  <p>But although sometimes in Ulcers of the Lungues we are forced to use binding Medicines, to joyn the Ulcer, yet are not these called Pectorals, because binding Medicines are extream hurtful to the Breast and Lungues, both because they hinder ones fetching his breath, and also because they hinder the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Flegm by which the Breast is oppressed.</p>
                  <p>Such Medicines are called Pectorals, which are of a<note n="*" place="margin">The next Section will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct you in the term.</note> lenifying Nature, for by their operation is the breath the easier fetched, and what sticks to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach the easier spit out.</p>
                  <p>Neither yet is the way or manner of provoking this same spitting alwaies one and the same, for som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the matter is so thin that it cannot be cast up by the motion of the Lungues, but it slips besides. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Sometimes it is so thick that it cannot be cast out by the narrow Arteries of the Lungues. These then are the genuine operations of Pectorals, <hi>viz.</hi> Some to make the thin matter thicker, others to make the thick matter thinner.</p>
                  <p>Besides, Those which make thin matter thicker are of two sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Some are mild and gentle, which may safely be administred, be the matter hot or cold which offendeth, (the degrees of temperature will sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, which such be among the Simples, neither shall you want instructions among the Compounds) O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are very cold, which are used only when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter offending is sharp.</p>
                  <p>But because such Medicines as conduce to the cure of the Phtisicks (which is an Ulceration of Lungues and the disease usually called, The Consumption of the Lungues) are also reckoned in amongst Pectorals. It is not amiss to speak a word or two of them.</p>
                  <p>In the cure of this disease are three things to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. To cut and bring away the Concreated Blood.</item>
                     <item>2. To cherish and strengthen the Lungues.</item>
                     <item>3. To conglutinate the Ulcer.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And indeed some particular Simples will perform all these, and Physitians confess it; which shews the wonderfull Mysterie the All-wife God hath made in the Creation, That one and the Same Simple should perform two contrary Operations on the same part of the Body; for the more a Medicine clenseth the more it conglutinates; And it is wisely done of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians to shut their Eyes against such a Mysterie, and against Astrology also, which is one means to reveal it, they make a long Harvest of little Corn, and get the more money by it. They usually in such cases first use Medicines which are more clensiing; lastly, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines more binding and strengthen the Lungues all the time.</p>
                  <p>To conclude then, Pectoral Medicines are such as either cut and clense out the compacted humors from the Arteries of the Lungues, or make thin Defluxions thick, or temper those that are sharp, help the Rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Wind-pipe, or are gently lenitive and soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, being outwardly applied to the Breast.</p>

                  <p>THese are they that are generally given under the notion of Cordials, take them under that name here.</p>
                  <p>The Heart is the seat of the vital Spirit, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of life, the original of infused heat, and of the natural affections of man.</p>
                  <p>So then these Two Things are proper to the Heart.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>And if these be proper to the Heart, you will easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant me, that it is the property of Cordials to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister to the Heart in these Particulars.</p>
                  <p>Of Cordials, some cheare the Mind, some streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Heart, and refresh the Spirits thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing decayed.</p>
                  <p>Those which checr the Mind are not one and the same; for as the Heart is variously disturbed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Anger, Love, Fear, Hatred, Sadness, &amp;c. So such things as flatter Lovers, or appease the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, or comfort the Fearful, or please the Hateful, may well be called Cordials; for the Heart, seeing it is placed in the middle between the Brain and the Liver, is wrought upon by Reason, aswell as by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion; yet these, because they are not Medicines, are beside my present scope.</p>
                  <p>And altough it is true, That Mirth, Love, &amp;c. are actions, or motions of the Mind, not of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; yet many have bin induced to think such Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may be wrought in the Body by Medicines, which some hold is done by an <hi>hidden property</hi> (the old Bush ignorant Physitians have run into) Others that denied any hidden quality in Medicines, held it to be done by Enchantment, and that is the only way of a thousand to lead people in ignorance, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:54721:94"/>
To tell them (when they cannot give, nor will not study a reason of a thing) It is <hi>Diabolical,</hi> and done by Sorcery. I could give a Reason of the former, if it were my present scope to speak of hidden proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; a very short time will discover the latter to be the greatest of Falshoods. But to return to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                  <p>The Heart is chiefly afflicted by too much heat, by Poyson, and by stinking Vapors, and these are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied by the second sort of Cordials, and indeed chicfly belong to our present scope.</p>
                  <list>
                     <head>According to these Three Afflictions, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>All these are called Cordials.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Such as cool the Heart in Feavers, yet is not every thing that cooleth Cordial, for Lead is colder than Gold, yet is not Lead Cordial as Gold is, some hold it Cordial by hidden Quality, others by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Because it cheers a mans heart to see he hath gotten Money, an Apish Reason, unbeseeming a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; for Pearls, taken inwardly, cool the heart, and cheer it exceedingly, and such a frigid Reason will no waies hold in that, what Medicines do by hidden Quality is not my task at present, it may be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, only here let it suffice, that cool Cordials are such Medicines as are apropriated to the Heart, and let the Heart be afflicted with heat, else take them not, for fear of Cordials they prove ruptures, for the Heart is maintained by heat, and not by cold.</item>
                     <item>2. Such as resist Poyson, There is a two-fold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of Poyson.</item>
                  </list>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. By an Antipathy between the Medicine and the Poyson.</item>
                     <item>2. By a Sympathy between the Medicine and the Heart.</item>
                     <item>
                        <p>Of the First we shall speak anon, in a Chapter by it self. The latter belongs to this Chapter, and they are such Medicines, whose nature is to strengthen the Heart, and fortifie it against the Poyson, as Rue, Angelica, &amp;c. For as the operation of the former is upon the Poyson, which afflicteth the Heart, so the operation of the latter is upon the Heart afflicted by the Poyson.</p>
                        <p>To this Classis may be referred all such Medicines, as strengthen the Heart, either by Astral influence, or by likeness of substance, if there be such a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Medicines, for a Bullocks heart is of like sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanceto a Mans, yet I question whether it be Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial or not.</p>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. And lastly, Such as refresh the Spirits, and make them lively and active, both because they are apropriated to that Office, and also because they drive stinking and Melancholly vapors from the Heart, for as the Animal spirits be refreshed by fragant smels, and the Natural Spirits by Spices; so are the vital Spirits refreshed by al such Medicins as keep back Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly vapors from the Heart, as Borrage, Bugloss, Rosemary, Citron Pills, the Compositions of them, and many others, which this Treatise will amply fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish you with.</item>

                  <p>BY Stomach, I mean that Ventricle which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Food till it be concocted into Chyle.</p>
                  <p>Medicines apropriated to the Stomach are usually called Stomachicals.</p>
                  <p>The infirmities usually incident co the Stomach are Three.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Appetite lost.</item>
                     <item>2. Digestion weakened.</item>
                     <item>3. The retentive Faculty corrupted.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>When Appetite is lost, the man feels no hunger when his Body needs Nourishment.</p>
                  <p>When Digestion is weakened it is not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct the meat received into the Stomach, but it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifies there.</p>
                  <p>When the retentive Faculty is spoiled, the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is not able to retain the Food till it be digested, but either vomits it up again, or causeth Fluxes.</p>
                  <p>Such Medicines then as remedy all these, are called Stomachicals. And of them in order.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Such as provoke Appetite are usually of a sharp or sourish tast, and yet withal of a grateful tast to the Pallat, for although loss of appetite may proceed from divers causes, as from Choller in the Stomach, or putrified humors or the like, yet such things as purge this Choller or humors, are properly called <hi>Orecticks,</hi> not Stomachicals; the former strengthen Appetite after these are expelled.</item>
                     <item>2. Such Medicines help Digestion as strengthen the Stomach, either by convenient heat, or Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical (<hi>viz.</hi> spicy) faculty, by hidden property, or congruity of Nature; by which last, the inner skin of a Hens Gizzard dried and beaten to Pouder and taken in Wine in the morning fasting is an exceeding strengthener of Digestion, because those Creatures have such strong Digestions themselves.</item>
                     <item>3. The retentive Faculty of the Stomach is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by binding Medicines, yet not by all binding Medicines neither, for some of them are adverse to the Stomach, but by such binding Medicines as are apropriated to the Stomach.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the Use of these.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Use not such Medicines as provoke Appetite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> you have clensed the Stomach of what hinders it.</item>
                     <item>2. Such Medicines as help Digestion (which the<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>) give them a good time before meat that so they may pass to the bottom of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach (for the digestive Faculty lies there) before the food come into it.</item>
                     <item>3. Such as strengthen the retentive Faculty, give<note place="margin">Use 3,</note> them a little before meat, if to stay Fluxes; a little after meat, if to stay vomiting.</item>

                  <p>BE pleased to take these under the name of Hepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, for that is the usual name Physitians give them, and these also are of Three sorts.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Some the Liver is delighted in.</item>
                     <item>2. Others strehgthen it.</item>
                     <item>3. Others help its vices.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The Pallat is the Seat of tast, and its Office is to judg what Food is agreeable to the Stomach, and what not, by that is both the Quality and Quantity of Food fit for the Stomach discerned: the very same Office the <hi>Meseraick</hi> Veins perform to the Liver.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes such Food pleaseth the Pallat which the Liver likes not (but not often) and therefore the <hi>Meseraick</hi> Veins resuse it, and that's thereason some few men fancy such food as makes them sick after the eating thereof.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The Liver is delighted exceedingly with sweet things, draws them greedily, and digesteth them as swiftly, and that's the reason Honey is so soon turned into Choller.</item>
                     <item>2. Such Medicines strengthen the Liver, as (being apropriated to it) very gently bind, for seeing the Office of the Liver is to concoct, it needs some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction, that so both the heat and the humor to be concocted may be staied that so the one slip not away, nor the other be scattered.</item>
                     <item>
                        <p>Yet do not Hepatical Medicines require so great a binding faculty as Stomachicals do, because the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Stomach are more open than those of the Liver, by which it either takes in Chyle, or sends out Blood to the rest of the Body, therefore Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which are very binding are hurtful to the Liver, and either cause obstructions, or hinder the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the Blood, or both.</p>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. The Liver being very subject to obstructions, Medicines which withstand obstructions, or open them being made, are truly Hepatical, and they are such as cut and extenuate without any vehement heat (to these we shall speak in their proper places) and yet they retain a faculty both gently binding, and clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</item>
                     <item>
                        <p>Sometimes Inflamation follows the obstruction, and then must you use Hepatical Medicines, which cool, clense, and extinuate.</p>
                        <p>In using these have a special care that your cooling Medicines be so tempered with heat, that the dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stive faculty of the Liver be not spoiled, and that the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> (which is very neer unto it) be not so cooled that it hinder the fetching of breath.</p>
                        <p>And thus much for the Liver, the Office of which is to concoct Chyle (which is a white substance the Stomach digests the food into) into Blood, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute it by the Veins to every part of the body, whereby the Body is nourished, and decaying flesh restored.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. 6. <hi>Of Medicines apropriated to the Spleen.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IN the breeding of Blood are three Excrements most conspicuous, <hi>viz. Urine. Choller,</hi> and <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The proper seat of Choller is in the Gall.</p>
                  <p>The Urine passeth down to the Reins or Kidneys, which is all one.</p>
                  <p>The Spleen takes the thickest or melancholly blood to it self.</p>
                  <p>I hope shortly to give you the exactest piece of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy now extant, in your own mother tongue, wherein you may as perfectly see these and all other internal operations of your Body, as you can your Faces in a Looking Glass. But to return.</p>
                  <p>This Excrement of Blood is twofold: for either by excessive heat, it is addust, and this is that the Latins call <hi>Atra bilis:</hi> or else it is thick and earthly of it self, and this properly is called Melancholly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.</p>
                  <p>Hence then is the nature of Splenical Medicines to be found out, and by these two is the Spleen usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted, for <hi>Atra bilis</hi> (I know not what distinct English name to give it) many times causeth Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and pure Melancholly causeth obstructions of the Bowels, and tumors, whereby the concoction of the Blood is viciated, and Dropsies many times fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>Medicines then peculiar to the Spleen must needs be twofold also, some apropriated to <hi>Atra bilis,</hi> others to pure Melancholly; but of purging either of them, I shall omit till I come to treat of Purging in a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by it self.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Such Medicines are Splenical, which by cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and moistning temper <hi>Atra bilis:</hi> let not these Medicines be to cold neither, for there is no such heat in <hi>Atra bilis</hi> as there is in Choller, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it needs no such excessive cooling; amongst the number of these are such as we mentioned amongst the Cordials, to repel Melancholly vapors from the Heart, such temper and asswage the malice of <hi>Atra bilis.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. Those Medicines are also Splenical, by which Melancholly humors are corrected and so prepared, that they may the more easily be evacuated; such Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are cutting and opening, and they differ from
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:54721:95"/>
Hepaticals, in this, that they are no waies binding, for the Spleen being no waies addicted to concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, binding Medicines do it harm, and not good.</item>
                     <item>3. Sometimes the Spleen is not only obstructed, but also hardned by Melancholly humors, and in such cases Emolient Medicines may be well called Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicals; not such as are taken inwardly, for they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon the Stomach and Bowels, but such as are outwardly applied to the Region of the Spleen.</item>
                     <item>
                        <p>Aud although sometimes Medicines are outwardly applied to hardness of the Liver, yet they differ from Splenicals, because they are binding, so are not Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicals.</p>

                  <p>THe Office of the Reins is, To make a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Blood and the Urin, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Urine thus separated from the Blood, is the Bladder ordained, which is of a sufficient bigness to contain it, that so a man may go about his business and not be alwaies pissing.</p>
                  <p>Both these parts of the Body officiating about the Urin, they are both usually afflicted by the vices of the Urin.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>Medicines apropriated to the Reins and Bladder are usually called <hi>Nephriticals</hi> and are Threefold; some cool, others cut gross humors, and a third sort breaks the Stone.</p>
                  <p>In the Use of all these, take notice, That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Reins and Bladder is such, That they abhor all binding Medicines, because they cause stoppage of Urine.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, I shall speak of all these apart in so many Chapters by themselves, only let it suffice here, That Physitians confess some Medicines perform these by an hidden <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, and even break the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Stone; but no man (they say, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not themselves) can give a Reason how, nor why they do it.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly, take notice, That the Reins and Bladder being subject to Inflamations endure not very hot Medicines.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly Because the Bladder is further remote from the Centre of the Body than the Kidnies are, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it requires stronger Medicines than the Kidnies do, lest the strength of the Medicine be spent before it be come to the part afflicted.</p>

                     </gap> properly Hystericals, but shall be spoken to by and by in a Chapter by themselves.</p>
                  <p>As for the Nature of the Womb, it seems to be much like the nature of the Brain and Stomach, for experience teacheth that it is delighted with sweet and Aromatical Medicines, and flies from their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                  <p>For example: A Woman being troubled with the Fits of the Mother, which is a drawing of the Womb upwards, apply sweet things, as Civit, or the like, to the place of Conception, it draws it down again, but apply stinking things to the Nose, as Assafoetida, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the like, it expels it from it, and sends it down to its proper place.</p>
                  <p>Again, Sometimes the Womb of a Woman falls out, in such cases, sweet scents applied to the Nose, and stinking things to the privy passage, reduces it to its proper place again, and this made some Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of Opinion that the Womb of a Woman was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the sence of smelling. For my part I beleeve nothing less; only it doth it by apropriation to that part of the Body, for the Stomach is also offended with stinking things, not because it smels them, but because they are obnoxious to that part of the Body, judg the like by the Womb; it is offended by stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, and strengthened by sweet: for smell is one of the Touch-stones by which Nature trieth what is convenient for its self; yet, that the Womb hath much affinity with the Head is most certain, and undeniable by this argument, Because most Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Medicines conduce to the cure of Diseases in the Womb, neither is the Womb often afflicted, but the Head principally suffers with it.</p>

                  <p>The Joynts are usually troubled with Cephalick Diseases, and then are to be cured by Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Medicines.</p>
                  <p>Medicines apropriated to the Joynts, are called by the name of <hi>Arthritical</hi> Medicines.</p>
                  <p>The Joynts, seeing they are very Nervous, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Medicines which are of a heating and drying Nature, with a gentle binding, and withal such as by a peculiar vertue are apropriated to them, and ad strength to them. It is true, most Cephalicks do so, yet because the Joynts are more remote from the Centre, they require stronger Medicines.</p>
                  <p>For removing pains in the Joynts this is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of proceeding.</p>
                  <p>Pains is either taken away, or eased, for the true cure is to take away the cause of the pain, sometimes the vehemency of the pain is so great that you must be forced to use <hi>Anodines</hi> (for so Physitians call such Medicines as ease pain) before you can meddle with the cause, and this is usually when the part pained is inflamed, for those Medicines which take away the cause of pain being very hot, if there be any Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the part pained, you must abstain from them till the Inflamation be taken away.</p>
                  <p>Also the manner of easing the pain is two-fold, for if you regard only the pain, use <hi>Anodines,</hi> but if you regard the Inflamation, use cooling Medicines; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by them, not only the heat is asswaged, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Flux of Blood to that part is stopped, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if you mix some repelling Medicine with it. We shall speak of all these in the next Section.</p>
                  <p>Only here take notice, That such Medicines as take away the cause of pain from the Joynts, are of very thin substance and forcible in cutting and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and when you see the cause is taken quite away, then use such as bind and strengthen the Joynts, that so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </head>
                  <p>THe various mixtures of Heat, Cold, Driness, and Moisture in Simples, must of necessity produce variety of Faculties, and Operations in them, which now we come to treat of, beginning first at Emollients.</p>
                  <p>What is hard and what is soft, most men know, but few are able to express; Phylosophers define that to be hard which yields not to touching, and soft to be the contrary; An Emollient, or softning Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine (which is all one) is such a Medicine as redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a hard substance to its proper temperature.</p>
                  <p>But to leave Phylosophy, and keep to Physick; Physitians describe hardness to be two-fold.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. A distention or stretching of a part by too much fulness.</item>
                     <item>2. Thick humors which are destitute of heat, growing hard in that part of the Body into which they flow.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>So many properties then ought Emollient Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to have, <hi>viz.</hi> to moisten what is dry, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuss what is stretched, to warm what is congealed by cold, yet properly, that only is said to mollifie which reduceth a hard substance to its proper temper.</p>
                  <p>Driness and thickness of humors being the cause of hardness, Emollient Medicines must of necessity be hot and moist; and although you may peradventure find some of them dry in the Second or Third De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, yet must this driness be tempered and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with heat and moisture, for Reason will tell you that dry Medicines make hard parts harder.</p>
                  <p>Besides, In Scirrhous humors (in which Emollients are most in use) various Symptoms appear, so that the hardness being not Simple, the Emollients are not, nor ought not to be alwaies one and the same, as for example: Sometimes the Swelling abounds with moisture, and then the Medicine must be dryer, not to mollifie the swelling, but to consume the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture; Sometimes the humor is so tough, that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Medicines will not stir it, then must the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine be the hotter, these things are accedental ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the humor offending is; it follows not for all this, that Emollient Medicines should not be temperately hot and moist in their own Nature; for general Rules are not to be accounted false, because a man must sometimes swerve from them, for this is the true use of all Rules, <hi>viz.</hi> To vary them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the various Symptoms of the Disease, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is the judgment of the Physitians tried.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Molifying Medicines are known, 1. By their tast, 2. By their feeling.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. In tast, they are neer unto sweet, but Fat and Oyly, they are neither sharp, nor austere, nor sowr, nor salt, neither do they manifest either binding, or vehement heat, or cold to be in them.</item>
                     <item>2. In feeling you can perceive no roughness, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they stick to your Fingers like Birdlime, for they ought to penetrate the parts to be mollified, and therefore many times if occasion be, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>GALEN in <hi>Lib. 5. De Simpl. Med. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. Cap.</hi> 10. determins Hardning Medicines to be cold and moist, and he brings some arguments to prove it, against which other Physitians contest.</p>
                  <p>I shall not here stand to quote the Dispute, only take notice, That if softning Medicines be hot and moist (as we shewed even now) then hardning Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines must needs be cold and dry, because they are contrary to them.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>The Universal course of Nature will prove it for driness and moisture are passive qualities, neither can extremities consist in moisture as you may know, if you do but consider that driness is not attributed to the Air, nor Water, but to the Fire, and Earth.</item>
                     <item>2. The thing to be <hi>congealed</hi> must needs be moist, therefore the Medicine <hi>congealing</hi> must of necessity be dry, for if cold be joyned with driness, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the pores that so the humors cannot be scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Yet you must observe a difference between Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines drying, making thick, hardning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealing, of which differences a few words will not do amiss.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Such Medicines are said to dry, which draw out, or drink up the moisture, as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> drinks up water.</item>
                     <item>2. Such Medicines are said to make thick, as do not consume the moisture, but ad driness to it, as you make Syrups into a thick Electuary by adding Pouders to them.</item>
                     <item>3. Such as congeal, neither draw out the moisture not make it thick by adding driness to it, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it by vehement cold, as Water is frozen into Ice.</item>
                     <item>4. Hardning disfers from all these, for the parts of the Body swell and are filled with Flegmatick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, or Melancholly Blood, which at last grows hard.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>That you may cleerly understand this, observe but these two things.</p>

                     <item>1. What it is which worketh.</item>
                     <item>2. What it worketh upon.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>That which worketh is outward cold, that which is wrought upon is a certain thickness &amp; driness of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, for if the humor were fluid as water is it might properly be said to be congealed by cold, but not so properly hardned. Thus you see cold &amp; drines to be the cause of hardning. But enough of this (perhaps some may think too much) This hardning being so far from being useful, that it is obnoxious to the Body of Man, I pass it without more words. I suppose when <hi>Galen</hi> wrote of hardning Medicines, he intended such as make thick, and therefore amongst them he reckons up, Fleawort, Purslain, Housleek, and the like, which asswage the heat of the humors in Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and stop subtil and sharp Defluxious upon the Lungues, but of these more anon.</p>

               <div n="3" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. 3. <hi>Of Loosning Medicines.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BY Loosning here, I do not mean Purging; not that which is opposit to Astringency, but that which is opposit to stretching: I knew not suddenly what fitter English Name to give it, than Loosning or Laxation, which latter is scarce English.</p>
                  <p>The Members are distended or stretched divers waies, and ought to be loosned as many, for they are stretched sometimes by driness, sometimes by cold, sometimes by repletion or fulness, sometimes by swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and sometimes by some of these joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. I avoid terms of Art as much as I can, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it would profit my Country but little, to give them the Rules of Physick in such English as they understand not.</p>
                  <p>I confess the Opinion of Ancient Physitians hath been various about these Loosning Medicines. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len's</hi> Opinion was, That they might be referred ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to moistning, or heating, or mollifying, or evacuating Medicines, and therefore ought not to be referr'd to a Chapter by themselves.</p>
                  <p>Tis like they may, and so may all other Medicines be referred to heat, or coldness, or dryness, or moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture: But we speak not here of the Particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Medicines, but of their Joyned proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as they heat and moisten.</p>
                  <p>Others, they question how they can be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from such as mollifie, seeing such as are loosning, and such as are emollient, are both of them hot and moist.</p>
                  <p>To that, thus: Stetching and Loosning are ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the movable parts of the Body, as to the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and their Tendons, to the Ligaments, and <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branae;</hi> But softness and hardness to such parts of the Body as may be felt with the hand: I shall make it cleer by a Similitude: Wax is softned being hard, but Fiddle-strings are loosned being stretched. And if you say that the difference lying only in the parts of the Body, is no true difference; then take notice, that such Medicines which loosen, are less hot and more moistning than such as soften, for they operate most by heat, these by moisture.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, I am of Opinion, the difference is not much, nay, scarce sensible, between Emollient and Loosning Medicines, Only I quoted this in a Chapter by itself, not so much because some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors do, as because it conduceth to the encrease of knowledge in Physick, for want of which this poor Nation is almost spoiled.</p>
                  <p>The chief Use of Loosning Medicines is in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions and Cramps, and such like infirmities which cause distention or stretching.</p>
                  <p>They are known by the very same marks and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens that Emollient Medicines are.</p>

                  <p>MEdicines which rarify, or make thin, are such which open the pores of the skin, and make them wider, they are not so moist as Emollient Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are, but of thin and subtil parts, they are hot, but not so hot that they should draw the matter to them, or discuss it, as we shall shew when we come to speak of those Faculties.</p>
                  <p>Such as make thick are contrary to these, these are cold and stop the pores of the skin.</p>
                  <p>These <hi>Galen</hi> would have to be moist, neither is there any difference between his Description of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Medicines, and such as make thick.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The Use of Rarifying Medicines is, to open the<note place="margin">Vse., 1.</note> pores of the skin, and make them wider, that so the vapors arising from Blood overheated may pass out, and that was the Reason Wrestlers in ancient times came to their exercise with their Bodies anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that so the vapors caused by stirring their Bodies might pass out, and not cause Feavers or other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the Bowels by being kept in.</item>
                     <item>2. Rarifying Medicines conduce much to the miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of pain, for the pores of the Skin being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the matter causing the pain is the easier expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Again, In swellings, it is not only the plenty of humors that causeth pain, but the driness, hardness, or stretching of the Skin, therefore seeing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which rarify or make thin, do both loosen and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:54721:97"/>
mollifie, they must of necessity by these operations mitigate pain.</p>
                  <p>Also there is much profit in the use of thickning Medicines, for they make the Skin firm, thereby not only the better resisting cold, but also they stop too much sweating, and desolution of the spirits that way, which often happens to them that are weak.</p>

                  <p>THese <hi>Galen</hi> thought to be hot, but of thick parts and biting.</p>
                  <p>Let none admire that thickness should be attributed to Medicines of an opening substance, seeing thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness seems rather to stop than to open. For answer to this, you must consider the manner of opening obstructions, and of opening the mouths of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels is different, Obstructions require cutting Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines by which the thickness of the matter obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is made thinner, therefore the Medicine ought not to be thick, but of thin substance that it may the better penetrate (I do not mean of a thin Body, like water, for that causeth Obstructions rather then take them away, but of thin parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Making thin) But those Medicines which are said to open the mouths or passages of the Vessels, are of thick parts, that they may not only penetrate, but also strengthen the passages by which they pass, therefore <hi>Galen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides heat, appointed thickness of parts and sharpness, or biting, as Pepper bites, for such a sharp heat is very effectual to penetrate, and cannot stop in the least; for although the Skin be easily contracted by gentle Medicines, the Vessels cannot be shut but by things vehemently binding, and therefore let these Medicines of thick substance be also moist, for moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture cannot so forcibly bind as to stop the mouths of the Vessels.</p>
                  <p>The Use of opening Medicines may be easily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered<note place="margin">Use.</note> from the use of the Vessels to be opened, for seeing their use is to hold Blood, which sometimes offend in quantity, sometimes in quality, such infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are to be remedied by opening Medicines.</p>
                  <p>They are easily known by tast, being sharp and piercing, and bite the tongue, but such as are stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, are cold and binding, and contract the tongue in tasting of them.</p>

                  <p>THe use of Attenuating Medicines is to open the obstructions of the Bowels.</p>
                  <p>The Bowels are obstructed or stopped by tough and viscus humors, hence then it is cleer that Attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or Extenuating Medicines ought to be thin of substance, but whether they ought all to be hot or not, is some question, for indeed many cold Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines cut tough humors and open obstructions, as Vinegar, Endive, Succory, and the like. I shall not enter into the Dispute here whether all cold things bind or not, and therefore some hold Vinegar to be hot in it self, and cool only by accedent; we know Wine is hot, and Vinegar is nothing but corrupted Wine, and we know as well that putrifaction turns things usually into a contrary quality, and besides if you ask Physitians how one Simple can perform two contrary operations, they presently run into the old bush, It doth it (say they) by a hidden quality.</p>
                  <p>The use of Attenuating Medicines is to open the Bowels, to clense the Breast of Flegm, co expel the Terms, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Your best course is, first to clense the body by some gentle purge before you use Attenuating Medicines, lest they seise upon the Blood and cause Feavers, or other mischeifs as bad.</p>
                  <p>They are in tast sharp, sowr, or bitter, yet such as being tasted dilate the tongue, and contract it not.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>BY Discussive Medicines I intend such as the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> commonly Physitians call them by the names of <hi>Diaphoreticks;</hi> in plain English, they are such Medicines as provoke Sweat, or as work by insensible transpiraton, which is another term they give to Sweating. I quote these terms, and explain them, because I would not have my Country-men hood-wink'd with strange terms; I am half of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it is one way by which they are trained up in sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                  <p>The nature of Discussing (or Sweating) Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines is almost the same with Attractive, for there are no discussive Medicines but are attractive, nor scarce any attractive Medicine but is in some measure or other discussing. The difference then is only this; That discussive Medicines is hotter than attractive, and therefore nothing else need be written of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Their Use may be known even from their very<note place="margin">Use.</note> Name; for diseases that come by repletion or fulness, are cured by evacuation or emptying, yet neither<note place="margin">Note.</note> Blood nor gross humors are to be expelled by Sweating or insensible transpiration (as they call it) but the one requires Blood-letting, the other Purgation; but <hi>Serosus</hi> or thin humors and filthy vapors, and such like superfluities, are to be expelled by sweat, and be wary in this too, for many of them work violently,<note place="margin">Caut. 1.</note> and violent Medicines are not rashly to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>Besides, Swellings are sometimes made so hard by<note place="margin">Caut. 2.</note> sweating Medicines, that afterwards they can never be cured; For what is Thin being by such Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines taken away, nothing but what is perfectly hard remains: If you fear such a thing, mix Emollients with them.</p>
                  <p>Again, Sometimes by using Discussives, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors<note place="margin">Caut. 3.</note> offending (which Physitians usually call the <hi>Peccant humor)</hi> is driven to some more noble part of the Body, or else it draws more than it discusseth; in such cases, concoct and attenuate the matter offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before you go about to discuss it.</p>
                  <p>From hence may easily be gathered at what time of the Disease Discussive Medicines are to be used, <hi>viz.</hi> about the declining of the disease, although in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases arising from heat of blood, we sometimes use them in the encrease and state of them.</p>
                  <p>They are known by the same marks and tokens attenuating Medicines are, <hi>viz.</hi> by their burning and biting quality, they being very hot and of thin parts, void of any biting quality, therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract not the Tongue in tasting of them.</p>

And so Medicines ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thick correspond to Attenuating Medicines, or such as make thin, repelling Medicines are opposed to such as draw, and such as retain the humors and make them tough, are oppisit to such as discuss, some hold this niceness needless.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The sentence of Authors about Repulsive Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines is various:</p>
                  <p>For seeing an Influxion may be caused many waies: A Repulsive hath got as many defenitions.</p>
                  <p>For such things as cool, bind, stop and make thick,

stay Influxions, and therefore Repulsives are by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors opposed. not only to Attractives, but also to Atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating, and Discussing Medicines.</p>
                  <p>But properly such things are called Repulsives, which do not only stay Inflaxions, (for so do such Medicines which step and and make thick) but such as drive the humors flowing to, or inherent in the place, to some other place.</p>
                  <p>The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> is, Binding is inherent to Repulsives, so is not coldness nor making thick: Yet such as are binding, cold and thin in operation are most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
                  <p>Your tast will find Repulsives to be, tart, or sharp, or austere, with a certain binding which contracts the Tongue.</p>
                  <p>Their Use is manifold, as in hot Tumors, Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aches<note place="margin">Use, 1.</note> or the like.</p>

                  <p>They are most commodious in the beginning and<note place="margin">Time of giving.</note> encrease of a disease, for then Influxions are most rife.</p>
                  <p>But seeing that in the cure of Tumors there are two Scopes, 1 That that which flows to it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled. 2 That that which is already in it may be discussed: Repulsives are most commodiously used in the beginning, discussives in the latter end.</p>
                  <p>In the middle you may mix them with this <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,</hi> That Repulsives exceed in the beginning, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussives in the latter end.</p>
                  <p>If the matter offending be of a venemous quality,<note place="margin">Caut. 1.</note> either abstain from Repulsives altogether, or use Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging first, lest the matter fly to the Bowels and prove dangerous, especially if the Bowels be weak.<note place="margin">2.</note>

                  <p>CLensing Medicines can neither be defined by heat, nor coldness,, because some of both sorts clense.</p>
                  <p>A clensing Medicine then is of a terrene quality, which takes away the filth with it and carries it out.</p>
                  <p>Here to avoid confusion, a difference must be made between wathing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

                     </gap>, carries away by Fluxion, as a man washeth the dirt off from a thing.</p>
                  <p>A clensing Medicine by a certain roughness or ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous quality, carries away the compacted filth with it.</p>
                  <p>This also is the difference between clensing and discussing Medicines, the one makes thick humors thin, and so scatters them, but a clensing Medicine takes the most tenacious humor along with it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any alteration.</p>
                  <p>Besides, Of clensing Medicines some are of a gentler nature which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>These are not known one and the same way, for some are sweet, some salt, and some bitter.</p>
                  <p>The Use of clensing is external, as the use of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges internal.</p>
                  <p>They are used to clense the Sanies and other filth of Ulcers, yea and to consume and eat away the Flesh it self, as burnt Allum, <hi>Prescipetate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>When these must be used, not only the affects of the Ulcers, but also the temperature of the Body will tell you.</p>

                  <p>THese have a great affinity with Emolients, like to them in temperature, only Emollients are mething hotter.</p>
                  <p>Yet is there a difference as apparent as the Sun is when he is upon the Meridian, and the use is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest. For,</p>
                  <p>Emollients are to make hard things soft; but what Suppures, rather makes a generation than an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the humor.</p>
                  <p>Natural heat is the efficient cause of Suppuration, neither can it be done by any external means.</p>
                  <p>Therefore such things are said to suppure, which by a gentle heat cherish the inbred heat of man.</p>
                  <p>This is done by such Medicines which are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temperate in heat, but also by a gentle viscosity, fill up or stop the Pores, that so the heat of the part affected be not scattered.</p>
                  <p>For although such things as bind hinder the dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Spirits, and internal heat, yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not the moisture as Suppuring Medicines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and especially do.</p>
                  <p>The heat then of Suppuring Medicines is like the internal heat of our Bodies.</p>
                  <p>As things then very hot, are ingrateful either by biting, as Pepper, or bitterness: in Suppuring Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, no biting, no binding, no nitrous quality is perceived by the tast (I shall give you better satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction both in this and others, by and by)</p>
                  <p>For Reason will tell a man, that such things hinder rather than help the work of Nature in Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>Yet it follows not from hence, That all Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Medicines are grateful to the tast, for many things grateful to the tast provoke Vomiting, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why may not the contrary be?</p>

                  <p>For many times one particular part of the Body is most afflicted by the Poyson, suppose the Stomach, Liver, Brain, or any other part, such as cherish and strengthen those parts being weakned, may be said to resist Poyson.</p>
                  <p>Such as strengthen the Spirits, strengthen all the Body.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes Poysons kill by their quality, and then are they to be corrected by their contraries.</p>
                  <p>They which kill by cooling are to be remedied by
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:54721:100"/>
heating, and the contrary, they which kill by corrho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are to be cured by lenitives such as temper their acrimony.</p>
                  <p>Those which kill by Induration, or Coagulation require cutting Medicines.</p>
                  <p>Also because all Poysons are in motion, neither stay they in one till they have seised and oppressed the Fountain of Life, therefore have they invented ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faculty to stay their motion, <hi>viz.</hi> Terrene and Emplastick.</p>
                  <p>For they judg, if the Poyson light upon these Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, they embrace them round with a viscous quality.</p>
                  <p>Also they say the waies and passages are stopped by such means, to hinder their proceeding, take <hi>Terra Lemnia</hi> for one.</p>
                  <p>Truly if these Reasons be good, which I leave to future time to determin, it may be done for a little cost.</p>
                  <p>Some are of opinion that the safest way is to expel the Poyson out of the Body, so soon as may be, and that is done, by Vomit, or Purge, or Sweat.</p>
                  <p>You need not question the time, but do it assoon as may be; for there is no Parlying with Poyson.</p>
                  <p>Let Vomiting be the first, Purging the next, and Sweating the last. This is general. But,</p>
                  <p>If thou doest but observe the nature and motion of he Venem, that will be thy best Instructer.</p>
                  <p>In the Stomach it requires Vomiting, in the Bloud and Spirits Sweating; if the Body be Plethorick, Bleeding; if full of evil humors, Purging.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, The Cure: being ended, strengthen the parts afflicted.</p>
                  <p>Thus our common Physitians, But out of questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Medecines whose operation is by Astral influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are both safest and speediest, not only in this but in all other Diseases, but this is beside my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent scope, and Physitians confess is hid from their eyes, that belongs to my own Model, which I trust in God I shall live to perfect. This is that that curés diseases <hi>per se,</hi> the other <hi>per accidens;</hi> this Moderns quite neglected: some Ancients were groping at it, though left it not to posterity.</p>

                  <p>Beauty is a blessing of God, and every one ought to preserve it; they offend as much that neglect it, as they do that paint their Faces.</p>
                  <p>They are apropriated to the Skin, Hair, and Teeth.</p>
                  <p>The Skin is pestered with Spots, Pimples, Freckles, Wrinkles and Sunburning.</p>
                  <p>The Hair either fals off, or hangs not as it should do.</p>
                  <p>The Teeth are either loose, or fal out, or stink, or are black.</p>
                  <p>Spots and Sun-burning, as also blackness of the Teeth are to be taken away by clensing Medicines, of which before.</p>
                  <p>Redness of the Face proceedeth from diverse cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, therefore are the remedies as diverse.</p>
                  <p>If of heat, cool the Blood; if it be impacted to the Skin, use extenuating Medicines; if of both, use both.</p>
                  <p>If the failing be extrinsecal, use extrinsecal Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; if intrinsecal, let the remedy be so also.</p>
                  <p>Wrinkles are taken away by Laxative, Lenient, and Emollient Medicines.</p>
                  <p>For falling off of Hair, correct the pravity of the humor that causeth it.</p>
                  <p>Gentle heat breeds hair, and preserves it; clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and corrhoding Medicines take it away.</p>
                  <p>Drying and binding Medicines cause Hair to curl.</p>
                  <p>Clensing things make the Teeth clean, binding things strengthen them, but have a care they have not a blackish quality with them, which is incident to many binding Medicines.</p>
                  <p>Clensing and discussing Medicines take Scurf or Dandrif from the Head.</p>

                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Cautions concerning Purging.</head>
                     <p>IN this, first consider diligently, and be exceeding cautious in it too, what the matter offending is, what part of the Body is afflicted by it, and which is the best way to bring it out.</p>
                     <p>Only here by the way first, have a care of giving Vomits, for they usually work more violently, and afflict the Body more than Purges do, therefore are not fit for weak Bodies, be sure the matter offending lie in the tunicle of the Stomach, else is a Vomit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in vain.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Vomits are more dangerous for Women than Men, especially such as are either with Child, or subject to the Fits of the Mother. This is the first Caution.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, What Medicine is apropriated to the purging of such a humor, for seeing the offending matter is not alike in all, the purging Medicine ought not to be the same to all. I shall speak more of this anon. As also of the divers waies whereby Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines draw out or cast out humors, <hi>viz.</hi> By lenify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, clensing, provoking Nature to expulsion, and (which is stranger than the Doctors <hi>hidden Quality)</hi> some purge by binding, but indeed and in truth such as are properly called purging Medicines, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these faculties have gotten another, by which they draw, or call out the humors from the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts of the Body, whether these do it by heat, or by an hidden quality, Physitians are scarce able to determin, it being very well known to modern Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians though the Ancient denied it, that many cold Medicines purge: For my part I shall forbear the Dispute here, not because I am not able to answer it, but because I would train up my Country men first a little better in the Grounds of Physick, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Opinion that yong Physitians as well as yong Christians ought not to be led into doubtful Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. This is the Second Caution.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There is this Faculty in all the Purges of <hi>Galen's</hi> Model (because he gives the whol <hi>Simple,</hi> which must needs consist of divers qualities, because the Creation is made up of, and consists by a harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of contraries) there is (I say) this Faculty in all Purges of that Nature, that they contain in them a substance which is inimical both to the Stomach and Bowels, and some are of opinion this doth good, namely, Provokes Nature the more to expulsion; the reason might be good if the Foundation of it were so, for by this reason Nature her self should purge not the Medicine, and a Physitian who takes his name from <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> which signifies Nature, should help Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in her business and not hinder her. But to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear being critical, this substance which I told you was inimical to the Stomach, must be corrected in every Purge; And this is my Third Caution.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The choice of Purging Medicines is very difficult, they are not Physick for every <hi>Ignoramus</hi> to prescribe, for some purge gently, some violently, some are apropriated to Flegm, some to Choller, some to Melancholly, and some to Water, or sero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus humors: Consider this but duly, and withal, what mischief may accrue by giving a Medicine pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Choller, in a Disease proceeding of Flegm or watry humors, you may easily see without a pair of Spectacles, that it cannot but weaken the Spirits ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and abate Natural heat, which is all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath to help her self in such a case, as also hinder the clarification of the Blood which is done by Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, thereby encreasing the Disease, and opening a gap to let out Life, and let in Death; It were vain to recite what mischiefs may follow the giving of violent Purges to weak Bodies, or to strong Bodies where the humor offending is not tough and viscous, but fluid and easie to be carried away, I shall touch upon them by and by, only here you may see reason enough, why I am so long upon this Subject.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, When you perfectly know the humor offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the convenient Medicine, and fit correction for it, the time and manner of using it remains to be enquired into.</p>
                     <p>These I thought to premise by way of Caution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the matter it self intended, and so much the rather because people from one Generation to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother have been so trained up in ignorance by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians who have absconded the Method of Physick from them, that now like mad men (oppression ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving almost, if not altogether made them so) when they all any thing, they take any Purge what their next Neighbor adviseth them to, right or wrong 'tis no matter, their wit in, and consideration of the business being much at one.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, In all these observe, That such as are gentle are only to be given to delicate and tender bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, whether the body be weake naturally, or caused so by sickness, above all give not vomits to weak sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, for the Fundament is ordained by nature to avoid the Excrements and not the mouth, which was ordained to take in, not to vomit out, therefore use vomits as seldom as may be.</p>
                        <p>But for the Election of Purges, Let such as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to flegm and Melancholly be mixed with such things as are thin in substance, and of a cutting quality, because these humors are tough, gentle Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines will serve to evacuate Water and Choller usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, I say [usually] because sometimes water requires such Medicines, as are of force to call them from the extream parts of the Body, and such must needs be violent in operation. I entreat all yong Students in Physick to be very careful in administring violent Medicines, and that never without due preparation of the Body beforehand, never unless the humor be so repugnant that it will not yield to gentler: And oh! that simple people would learn to be but so wise as to let them alone, and not take them themselves, the evil they may do them (if not regulated by an abler brain than dwels in their skuls) is certain, the good very uncertain; for such violent Medicines as purge Choller if immoderately taken, first draw the Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, then the Flegm, afterwards the Melancholly, then they cuase corrosions and draw the blood; Such as purge Flegm and Water violently when they have drawn that, then they draw the Choller, then Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, they then corrode, and so either by exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation or opening the mouths of the Veins, bloody Fluxes also follow, and many times the disease ends in the Grave; and so also the immoderate Purgation of Melancholly, first draws Choller (I mean after the Melancholly is evacuated) then Flegm, and ends as the other do, but I think this is enough to wise men. To return.</p>
                        <p>If you prepare the body beforehand (you will not want instructions how to do it in the COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POUNDS) then gentler Medicines will serve the turn, and therefore such Medicines as purge Water, ad but cutting Medicines to them, and they purge Flegm.</p>
                        <p>And then again, I desire you to take notice that such Medicines as have a binding quality in them are very hurtful to tough Flegm, and Melancholly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the humors themselves being tough they make them the tougher, but they are most proper for chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and putrified <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>, because the first of them often causeth Defluxions, the second a loosness.</p>
                        <p>Again, Another thing I thought good to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and so much the rather because I have seen it printed in English, and heard it contended for by Students in Physick, yet is the conceipt very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, <hi>viz.</hi> That the operations of Purging Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines may be known by their colors, for say they, white Medicines purge Flegm; black, Melancholly; and yellow, Choller: I confess some Ancient Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians were of this apish Opinion, which in no wise holds true in the general, though in some particulars it may.</p>

                     <head>Of the time of Purging.</head>
                     <p>IT was the Opinion of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> alwaies to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Body with hot and cutting Syrups before the purging Medicine be given, with this Proviso, That the matter be not so hot that it be thrust into the Veins and cause Feavers.</p>
                     <p>If your Purge must be strong, take some lenitive Purge, or else a Clyster before you take it, lest the passages being not opened, the matter being violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expelled be stopped in its passage, and so either Chollicks, or vehement Belly-ach, or worse mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief follow.</p>
                     <p>Let it be two hours ere you drink, and four or five ere you eat after you have taken a Purge, and let your Stomach be empty when you take them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Lest being mixed with the nourishment they lose their force, and so Nature convert them into nourishment, thereby corrupting the Blood.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. All Purges are enemies to Nature, and if you mix them with food, Nature detains them the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and by consequence is the more prejudiced by them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is very unfitting to molest Dame Nature with two several motions at one time, <hi>viz.</hi> To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Purge and the obnoxious humor with it, and also at the same time to nourish the Body.</p>
                     <p>As for Lenitives or gentle Purges, and many Pills, they may safely be taken at night, as you were taught in the first part of my Directory, to which I refer you for Directions in all Purges, and I shall have a word or two to say concerning Vomits before I have done this Book: I refer it here therefore to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place.</p>
                     <p>I shall here conclude with this Caveat, Never take sweet things after Purges, because the Liver draws them so greedily that they soon turn the Purge to ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which if any thing will bring mischiefs more than enough to the Body, this will.</p>

                     <head>Of the correcting of Purging Medicines</head>
                     <p>IN Purging Medicines are many things consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able which are either to be helped forwards or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, for of Purges some work too slowly, others too violently.</p>
                     <p>Or to be a little more distinct, some vices of a Purge may be known before it is given, and others not till after, I shall begin with the first.</p>
                     <p>There is this almost properly in all Purges, that they are obnoxious to the Stomach, and indeed to Nature it self, therefore mix some things with them which strengthen the Heart and Stomach.</p>
                     <p>Again, The gentlest Purgers that are have one discommodity in them that they are easily turned to Wind, therefore mix such things with them as expel wind (the former Rules amongst the Simples will furnish you with enough and more than enough of either) for although they be not windy of themselves, yet by their heat they stir up wind, though they meét with Flegm, or Melancholly.</p>
                     <p>Violent Purges by their Acrimony or sharp gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quality are inimical to the Bowels, which must in no wise be corrected with binding Physicks, for that will mend them as the Fletcher mends his Bolt, <hi>viz.</hi> Spoil all, and that by keeping them so long in the Body; such things as make slippery, lenifie, and something thicken, are proper corrigents for them, such are Quince Seeds, Mallows, Gum Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacanth, and the like.</p>
                     <p>After the Purge is given, it may offend on either hand, <hi>viz.</hi> By working either not at all, or too violently, If it work not at all, take hot Broaths; if they will not do the deed, use a Clyster.</p>
                     <p>Various and manifold are the evils that a Purge working too violently may afflict upon the Body of Man, and very dangerous, for such may produce these, or any of these consequences, and poor silly people that take them, never know whence they come.</p>

                     <p>If you feel these, or any of these Symptoms after Purging, you may give a shrewd guess, either your Purge was not proper for your Disease, or else wrought too violently.</p>
                     <p>It is not my present Task to shew you how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy these, the Table at the latter end will instruct you with Medicines for each, and you cannot be more unwilling to pay for one thing twice, than I am to write it.</p>
                     <p>For preventing such evils as these are (or others which perhaps a man might find in Authors) accept of these following Aphorisms.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Be sure you strengthen the Heart, for if that fail, all will be naught.</item>
                        <item>2. When you perceive your Purge works too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, you may then know Nature hath got an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy that is too hard for her, therefore make as much hast as you can to expel him, ease your Body of the Purge so soon as you can, for the longer it staies in your Body, the more inimical it proves, either poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning it, or leaving such Symptoms behind it as we mentioned even now, which may be done by drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king much Barly Water (or for want of it take any warm Water, that is clean, as Spring Water or the the like) wherein the Seeds of Fleawort, or Quince Seeds, or Gum Tragacanth is dissolved, for that

makes the passages slippery, and hinders excoriation of the Bowels: Country people that know not how to get these, may boyl two handfuls of Mallows in a quart of Water to a pint, and drink it up, if that help not, let them drink another.</item>
                        <item>3. If you find the Mouths of the Veins be opened, which you may know if much blood come from you without any skins, then take a Clyster made only of new Milk, a drachm of Mastich in pouder being added to it.</item>
                        <item>4. Oyl of sweet Almonds taken inwardly, an ounce at a time, and as often as you will, is excellent in such a case, but let it be newly drawn.</item>
                        <item>5. Juyce of Quinces, Syrup of Quinces, Preserved Quinces, or that which in <hi>Suffex</hi> the Gently call <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milade</hi> is very good; according to <hi>

                           <p>His last (but my first) is this; To take three grains of Laudanum, or if your Body be weak, but two.</p>
                           <p>The Second is, To take a Vomit, thereby to divert the humors from their unbridled Course downward.</p>

If the humors be to be drawn from remote parts of the Body, as the Head, Arms, Feet, or the like, let the Purge be made up in a hard form as Pills are, for by that means it staies the longer in the Body, and is in all reason therefore the better able to perform its Office.</item>
                        <item>2. If the afflicting humor lie in the Bowels, or parts adjacent, use liquid Medicines, for they operate speediest, and the Bowels are soon hurt by Purging Medicines.</item>
                        <item>3. The infusion of such Medicines as leave a binding quality behind them, or their Decoction is most fitting to be used, for it is the earthy (quality of them which binds, much of which is cast away in an Infusion or Decoction, but all of it taken if you take the body of the simple.</item>

                           <p>Such Purging Medicines as do leave a binding qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity behind them, the chiefest of them are these, <hi>Aloes, Wormwood, Damask Roses, Rhubarb, Rhapontick, all the five sorts of Myrobalans, Prunes, Tamarinds, &amp;c.</hi>

                              </gap>, it is impossible to carry it away all at once, your way then is to take gentle Purges, and take them often; for if the Purge be too strong, it will weaken Nature so, that the House (I mean the Body) will fall down before you can clense it of the filth; and of such a Nature usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is Melancholly.</p>
                           <p>As for the Doses of Purges it is impossible to prescribe such general Rules, but they must of necessity do far more harm than good, for particulars you may if you please find them, in the first part of the Book concerning <hi>Simples,</hi> and in that part concerning <hi>Compounds.</hi>
