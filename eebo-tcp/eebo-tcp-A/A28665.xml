         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Preparation for His Majeſties Return.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> King is <hi>Quaſi caput
populi,</hi> the
head of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and if the
head be abſent,
the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.
Yea the
joy and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
conſolation
of a Nation, is
the preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiment
of their
Prince. But I do
not delineate
this in a Tropologicall ſence, or that any ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
hereupon, that our Royall Kings Abſence ſhould
cauſe, or produce any diſtaſters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65333:3"/>
For hee had bin ſo oppoſed in his pleaſures,
and Commands, that it did not onely cauſe his
juſt indignation, but likewiſe reſpectively indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him to leave his Palace at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and
progreſſed forwards to <hi>Windſor,</hi> where his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
hath continued a long time.</p>
            <p>But he taking into his Princely conſideration
the longing expectation of his loyall Subjects
for his preſence, the great deſolation, and condole
for his abſence: together with the manifold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions,
and diſtempers in the kingdome, did
moſt diſcreetly reſolve himſelf to honour the
<hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>City</hi> once more with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the <hi>Parliament and City</hi> having
intelligence, did reſpectively conſult, how they
ſhould congratulate his Majeſty in ſuch ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
manner, <hi>as might be correſpondent to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
pleaſure.</hi> Divers <hi>Parliament men</hi> were
immediately ſelected both out of the Houſe of
Peers and Commons, to meet him: as alſo, the
Lord Major, Aldermen, and chief Citizens, are
in preparation to congratulate his Majeſty. But
after their ſubmiſſive, and humble ſalutation
there are divers Petitions to be delivered, and,
preſented to his Majeſty, concerning his gracious
concurrance with the <hi>Parliament,</hi> in extirpating
the Recuſant party, and devoting the Popiſh
Lords and Biſhops from the Houſe of Peers, and
deſiring his longer continuance with them, in the
eſtabliſhing of the weighty, and impendent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the <hi>Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65333:3"/>
I cannot abſolutely and directly ſatisfie the
Reader hereof, the prefixed time when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
will certainly return for that is very ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous:
but this J can reſolve him off, he is daily
expected, and without doubt he will be here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in a ſudden proceſſe of time: And as ſoone
as the Parliament and City can have more direct
and confident intelligence of his more certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
they will perform what is aforementioned:
in the mean time they are in great and deliberate
preparation for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Yet in his abſence, hee hath not bin altogether
vnmindfull of his People, but hath bin rather
more ſollicitous, and as tender over their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
as a father is over his own Son. Hee hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
ſent Letters to his <hi>Parliament</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and encourage them in their unwearied ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity.</p>
            <p>Hee hath likewiſe graciouſly anſwered them
in all their Petitions, and hath become as indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
as ever Prince hath bin.</p>
            <p>None knowes the care and ſolicitation of a
Prince; for they (<hi>Atlas-like</hi>) do ſupport the
burthen of the whole Kingdome beſides: and
withall they do judiciouſly conſider, that <hi>Regis
ad exemplum totus componitur orbis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Subjects are compoſed to follow the
pattern and example of their Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65333:4"/>
And God be praiſed, our King may be eſteemed,
and reputed the glory, and mirror of the world:
both in his own Princely life, and exhortive ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
to his Subjects two things eſpecially
entertained in his Royall breaſt ſeen to be unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd.
<hi>Firſt his Patience, then his conſtancie for
the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For which two, he ought not onely to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded,
but likewiſe meritoriouſly deſerve the
diurnall prayers of his liege People, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
and corroboration of the ſame.</p>
            <p>God of his infinite mercy grant that the King
and Parliament may co-unitely concur for the
ſetling of peace and tranquility amongſt us, the
eſtabliſhing of Religion, and the mittigating of
theſe various diſtempers, and diſtractions: that
all obſtacles, and obſtructions whatſoever, that
interrupts either of them may be moved, and the
pure ſtreams of Juſtice run clearly againſt all
Delinquents without connivance, or partiality.
For the State lies ſick, and of a dangerous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
too, which (if it be not ſuddainly cured) will
contaminate the whole land, break out into an
ulcer, and ſo exulcerate all parts by its peſtife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and diffuſive contagion of ruinate deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
But I hope that maladie likewiſe will be
averted from us, and the Kingdome likewiſe
will be ſoundly purged from all diſtempers that
now corrupt it: then I ſay, all diſcords and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
will be ended, at the reciprocall and
<pb facs="tcp:65333:4"/>
mutuall conjunction of the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Thus ſhall pietie, and ſincere Religion
diſtend its branches once more, peace and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
reflouriſh again within our walles, and all
tumultuous confuſions be anihilated and aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
to the honour of Gods holy name, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and fame of his Majeſtie, the immortall
renown and credit of the Parliament, and the
eternall proſperitie of the Kingdome.</p>
