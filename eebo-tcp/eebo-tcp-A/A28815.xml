         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The one is an immoderate and extream diet, which weakneth the ſtomack and body ſo much, that nature cannot prevail to conglutinate or ſoder the fleſh together. And thus through want of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heat, the wound falleth to impoſtumation, <hi>Gangrena, fiſtulaes, &amp;c.</hi> and can hardly be cured. The ſecond is the kéeping of them too much open by reaſon of their tents or pledgets, ſo that they cannot join together again, but grow to Cancers, and Fiſtulaes, whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many times the patient remaineth lame ever after, or elſe ſpéedy death is the end thereof.</p>

H.</hi> findeth himſelf ill this preſent day, being the firſt of <hi>Aprill, 1651,</hi> and ſeeketh unto me for remedy, I find at this time <hi>Saturn</hi> in oppoſition with the Moon, and <hi>Mars</hi> with a quartille <hi>12</hi> degrées, a ſextile with <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> 6 degrées, by which I adjudge if not a good time to miniſter Phyſick, and the next day like unto it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſſe I perceive the Patient to be in great neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. I perſwade him not to take his Phyſick untill the third day, which I find favoured with better aſpects.</p>
                  <p>Theſe kind of obſervations are of great antiquity, and were in high eſteem among the moſt learned Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, the practiſe whereof is of that ſingular uſe in theſe times that ſome in <hi>London</hi> and other places, which ſoar with the higheſt on the wings of ſame, give judgements this way, rather then by the vrine, and therefore I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thou wilt not think it loſſe of time, if I am the more large on this point.</p>
                  <p>If thou wilt therefore be expert in this art thou muſt be throughly informed concerning the courſe of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the celeſtial bodies, and what the ſigns and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects be, which thou haſt more lively repreſented by this Figure.</p>

                  <p>An Aſpect of any of the Planets is a certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betwéen the centers of two Planets, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they notably help or hinder, proſper or afflict; for by good aſpects, as the Sextile, and Trine they aſſiſt and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but by a Quartile and oppoſition, they vex hinder and aflict: ſo that by this thou mayeſt perceive the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction is good with good and evill with bad.</p>
                  <p>By a Trine you are to underſtand a third part of the Air, a Quaril<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51516:59"/>
a conjunction is when they méet. But that which is of the chiefeſt uſe in matter of thy ſtudy and practiſeis, the knowledge of the twelve houſes, which Aſtronomically are deciphered thus.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>In each houſe thou findeſt characterized one of the 12 Signs, yet note that they do alter and change according to the Quotidian and courſe of motions. Thrée of theſe ſigns be of the nature of fire, three of air, three of water, and three of earth. The thrée fiery Signs are <hi>Aries, Leo, Sagitarius;</hi> the thrée of the ayr be <hi>Gemini, Libra,</hi> and <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi> the three of the water, are <hi>Cancer, Scorpio,</hi> and <hi>Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And when 2 Planets are in one ſign, and one degree of the Zodiack there is a conjunction.</p>
                  <p>Therefore as it is neceſſary that theu ſhouldeſt know what the ſign is, when thy Patient falleth ſick, ſo muſt thou likewiſe know what Planet is Lord of the houſe, then obſerve what the Aſpects are (deſcribed in the firſt Globe or Sphear) and it will not a little direct thy iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both concerning the diſeaſe, the remedy, and the time of continuance or abatement thereof.</p>
