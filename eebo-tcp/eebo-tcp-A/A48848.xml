            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>JOHN 16. 2.</bibl>
               <q>They shall put you out of the Synagegues:
Yea the time cometh, that whosoever
killeth you, will think that he doth God
service.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Words are part of that
Discourse which our Saviour
made to his Disciples the
Night before his Passion. The
Words of a Dying Man use
to leave the deepest Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
And that was the end for which Christ
intended this Discourse: He knew there would
be a more than ordinary need of it. That
which gave such force to his Words, was the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61303:3"/>
very cause of this need; that is, his Death.
For Him to suffer Death, whom they lookt
upon as their Messias; Him that was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the Kingdom to <hi>Israel;</hi> For Him to Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
that great Work by Dying; They were
in pain to hear this: For Him to suffer such a
Death; They were offended at it, often of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
as often as He spoke of it.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour considered their Weakness in
this; and mildly told them, it should not be
so, but much otherwise. That which they
were so apt to be offended with, when they
heard it; He made them hear it, that they
might not be offended, when it came to pass.
<hi>These things have I spoken to you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 1.</note> (saith he)
<hi>to the end that ye should not be offended;</hi> that
you should not be scandalized, nor deterred
from my Service, by any thing that I am to
suffer. Nay more; What you shall see done
in Me, will likewise be done in You. As I
am rejected and put to Death, so shall You
be, and that for Righteousness sake. They
which now begin their Work with Me, shall
deal likewise with You when I am gone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The time comes;</hi> and thus it will be, till
time be at an end: <hi>The time comes when</hi> they
shall remove you from their Assemblies; <hi>they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61303:3"/>
shall put you out of their Synagogues;</hi> Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
you for your Christian Profession.
And having done so, <hi>they shall kill you;</hi> and
all this in Zeal, thinking it not only lawful,
but acceps to God. They shall do it as
Men that would <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>do
God Service,</hi> or Worship; so the Original sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies;
as if in so doing, they should offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to God.</p>
            <p>It is a wonderful thing: That Men of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and Conscience, and Religion; they
who doubtless were a True, though then a
Corrupt Church of God; should think to
please God with those Sacrifices, which were
scarce offered to the Devil by any other but
the most Barbarous and Brutish part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
What? To Sacrifice to God with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Blood, which in his Law he had positively
and directly forbidden? To kill Men upon
His account, that has expresly said, <hi>Thou shalt
not kill?</hi> To kill, not Malefactors, but the
most faithful Servants of God, the Apostles of
our Lord Jesus Christ? To <hi>kill</hi> them <hi>to do
God service,</hi> was surely a most preposterous
way.</p>
            <p>But they that did it thought otherwise; and
they thought as they were taught; they acted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61303:4"/>
according to their Principle: It was the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of their Religion, that false Prophets are
to be put to Death. 'Tis most true, God
had so ordained it in his Law, as you read
<hi>Deut.</hi> 13. six first Verses.</p>
            <p>But how should a false Prophet be tried?
Among the Jews he should be tried by his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And how his Doctrine? By Scripture.
God sent them <hi>to the Law, and to the Testimony:</hi>
and declared, that, if Men that took upon them
to Prophecy, spake not according to this Rule,
they had no Light in them; then they were to
be taken for false Prophets.</p>
            <p>But these of whom our Saviour speaks, the
Jews of his Age, had another way of Trial,
which they held at least equal with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
That was their Oral Tradition. Our
Saviour told them of it: He blamed them
smartly for preferring it before Scripture. <hi>You
make,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 15. 16.</note> (saith he) <hi>the Scripture of no Effect by
your Tradition.</hi> By this Tradition, if they tried
Christ and his Apostles, and judged them all
to be False Prophets that would not receive it,
they must judge Christ and his Apostles to be
False Prophets; and, as such, must kill them
by their Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61303:4"/>
Thus they did. They dealt so, First with
Christ himself, and Then with his Apostles.
And they thought they did well in it. They
did this upon the Account of Religion. It
was indeed for their Religion, such as it was;
not grounded on Scripture, but on that False
Rule of Oral Tradition. In Defence of their
Traditions, they killed the Followers, and even
the Writers of Scripture. <hi>
                  <unclear>Tanto in Religio</unclear> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit</hi>—Such
a mischievous pernicious <unclear>Inflorence</unclear>
hath misguided Religion upon the Souls and
Consciences of Men.</p>
            <p>So that now in my Text we have two things
to consider. You see the Theme of it is Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
against the Followers of Christ.</p>
            <p>You see, <hi>First,</hi> the Cause of it is Misground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Religion. In these Jews, it was grounded,
not on Scripture, but on Tradition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> you see the Effect of it, in their
carriage towards the Followers of Christ. The
Effect is twofold:</p>
            <p>First, to shut them out of the Church by
Excommunication;</p>
            <p>Secondly, having so done, to put them to
Death. <hi>They shall Kill you,</hi> saith my Text.</p>
            <p>Now Killing again is twofold; either Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
by the Magistrate; or Privately, by any
particular Person.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61303:5"/>
'Tis all one to him that Suffereth, whether
he die by the Sword of Justice, or whether he
have his Throat cut in a Massacre, or by Assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sination.
But as to the Authors, 'tis far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
The Sword of Justice may be Abused,
in many respects; and is so sometimes in all
Nations. It may kill the Innocent, through
Misinformation; and the Magistrate may be
faultless in doing it. But for Private Mens
Killing, by Assassination or by Massacre, it is
and ought to be odious in all Nations. Yet
some will do it, and Justifie it. My Text
says, some would not stick to do it, yea and
justifie it, upon the account of Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Time when they will do this;
<hi>The time comes,</hi> says our Saviour. <hi>Comes,</hi> when?
Now under the Gospel. The Jews did it at
the Entrance of the Gospel. In After-times,
that Christians should do it, that profess to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Gospel; Did our Saviour ever think
of this? If he did, you may soon guess of
what sort he meant. For I know but one
sort of Christians, that do it, and that justifie
it, upon account of Religion. I know not
any Principles for it, among Christians, but
theirs in the Roman Church.</p>
            <p>It seems as if Christ looked upon them, when
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61303:5"/>
he said these words to his Disciples. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
he thought of them, if what he said to
his Disciples, were intended of any sort of
Christians. He declared elsewhere, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 20.
that what he said, he intended <hi>not for them
alone, but for them also who should believe on
him through their word.</hi> I say therefore, if our
Saviour had any thought, of Christians that
should suffer from their Brethren, as his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
did from the Jews; I know not where to
apply this, but only to them of the Roman
Church. Of them only among Christians he
had Occasion to say this. <hi>They shall put you out
of the Synagogues, yea when they kill you they
shall think that they do God service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that I have a twofold Consideration in
these words. First, in relation to the Jews;
and Secondly, to the Romish Christians.</p>
            <p>First, in relation to the Jews, Christ said
these words immediately to his Disciples; that
the Jews would Excommunicate Them, and
Kill them in pure Zeal for their Religion.</p>
            <p>To pursue this in the Method that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
at first; <hi>First,</hi> the Cause of those E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
which the Jews did to the Apostles, was
meerly Zeal for their Traditionary Religion.
What their Zeal was, you know, is often
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61303:6"/>
spoken in Scripture. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> testifies of them,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2. They had <hi>a Zeal,</hi> but <hi>not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Knowledge.</hi> They reckon'd it <hi>Zeal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God,</hi> Acts 22. 3. They were <hi>Zealous of
their Law,</hi> Acts 21. 20.</p>
            <p>But by the <hi>Law,</hi> they meant chiefly their
<hi>Customs.</hi> So 'tis explained <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 13, 14. Those
Jews that bore Witness against <hi>Stephen,</hi> their
Witness was, that <hi>He blasphemed against God,
and against Moses,</hi> Vers. 11. How did it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear?
In the the Thirteenth Verse, <hi>He spoke
against the holy Place, and the Law.</hi> What did
they mean by <hi>the Law?</hi> Even <hi>the Customs
which Moses delivered them.</hi> No doubt their
Hebrew word was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> their Cabalistical
Rites, their Traditionary Customs, <hi>Quos Moses
Tradidit,</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> delivered by word of
Mouth.</p>
            <p>That this was their meaning it appears by
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Explication. Speaking of himself, what
he did when he was a Jew, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14. Saith
he, <hi>I beyond measure persecuted the Church of
God, and wasted it.</hi> A Jew persecute the
Church of God? Wherefore did he do it? He
declares what I have said. <hi>I was,</hi> saith he, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
Zealous for the Traditions of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
That stuck more with the Jews, than
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61303:6"/>
the Scripture, the Written Law of God. They
insisted much less upon the Law, than upon
the Traditions. Yea they called their Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>the Law,</hi> as you have heard; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for them, as being Essential to Religion.
Saith the Apostle, <hi>I profited in the Iews Religion
above many of my Equals in my own Nation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more exceedingly Zealous for the Traditions
of my Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So we have found out the Cause of this
Carriage that follows. The Jews Cause was,
the Defence of their Traditions.</p>
            <p>Their Carriage it self was, First, to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate;
and Secondly, to Kill, those that
convinced them out of the Written Word of
God.</p>
            <p>Since their Religion was founded, not on
Scripture, but Tradition, in those Points that
were in Controversie between them and the
Disciples; The Disciples not owning, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
those Traditions, they lookt upon
them as Men of Another Religion, that is, both
as Heretics, and Schismatics. And as such, They
<hi>put</hi> them <hi>out of their Synagogues,</hi> they cast them
out of the Church, they cut them off by the
Sentence of Excommunication.</p>
            <p>Even while our Saviour lived, they had <hi>agreed</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61303:7"/>
among themselves, that <hi>whosoever confessed him
should be turned out of the Synagogue,</hi> Joh. 9. 22.</p>
            <p>According to this Agreement, when one
born blind, being cured by our Saviour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
him; and maintained it, that he that
cured him, could be no other but a Prophet
sent from God: They were so moved at this
Confession, and so inraged at him that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his Sight, (the more inraged, because
the matter was so evident) that, not knowing
how at that time to revenge themselves other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
(for the People took Christ for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
therefore they durst not meddle with
Him;) they fell upon the Poor Man, they took
Occasion against him to turn him out of the
Synagogue, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 34.</p>
            <p>And the Matter was so notorious, that some
that did believe in Christ, yet durst not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12 4. They knew they ought;
but they durst not, for fear of being turned out
of the Synagogue.</p>
            <p>'Tis known to them that are conversant in
the Writings of the Jews, that whensoever
they had any cut off by their Censures, it was
their way to expose them with Contumelious
Names. They called them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
that is, Heretics, and Schismatics.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:61303:7"/>
Secondly, Whom they cast out for a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,
or a Schismatic, they lookt upon him as not
worthy to live. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> discovered
himself to be a Christian; they threw off their
Clothes, they threw Dust into the Air, they
cried, <hi>Away with such a Fellow from the Earth,
for it is not fit that he should live,</hi> Acts 22. 23.
They would have stoned him, if they durst;
but that the Roman Governour was present, as
you read there, <hi>Vers.</hi> 34. By saying, That <hi>he
ought not to live;</hi> their meaning was, That it
was a good deed to kill him; which was the
usual Effect of their total and final Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</p>
            <p>The Effect of it was Killing; with those
horrible Circumstances, that, whereas he that
was killed was judged an Enemy of God, he
that killed him was considered as having done
God a great piece of Service: which made
this much different from any other kind of
Death. He that killed a Man otherwise, knew
he did Murther. He that killed him for God's
sake, lookt upon it as a Sacrifice: So far from
being an Offence against God, that it rather
made amends for all his other Offences.</p>
            <p>And whereas he that ordinarily kills a Man,
seeks nothing more but to be rid of him as soon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61303:8"/>
as he can; and therefore makes haste to put
him out of his Pain; Those that put Men to
Death for Religion, think no Death too se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere.
Single Death is not enough: It is too
soon over. They will make such a one feel
how he dies. Common Rage is but a blunt
Sword, in comparison of that which is whetted
and edged with a Zeal of mistaken Religion.</p>
            <p>First, by the Sword of Justice: If the Jews
put one to Death for Religion, it must be done
by the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> who were their Judges in
Ecclesiastical things. But the <hi>Sanhedrims</hi> way
of putting. Men to Death was by Stoning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which was a very Unmerciful Death. St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>
felt it. He was thus put to Death for
Religion. <hi>And they stoned Stephen calling upon
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Herod,</hi> that had no such Motive as
Religion, was yet pleased for Popularity to
put St. <hi>Iames</hi> the Apostle to Death, he only
<hi>killed him with the Sword,</hi> Acts 12. 2. If the
Jews had had the doing of it, it would have
been done at another Rate.</p>
            <p>Else, possibly for Haste, or for Concealment,
or the like, when they could not intend those
more exquisite Cruelties; and so in those cases
where the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> had no power; there they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61303:8"/>
were for destroying by Assassination; as you
read, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 12. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> was so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
by the Magistrate, that they could not
come at him in a Legal Judicial way; then
they resolved to Assassinate him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They bound
themselves under a Curse, that they would
neither eat nor drink till they had killed <hi>Paul.</hi>
And they were more than forty of the Jews
that had made this Conspiracy. Those were
of the <hi>Cannitae,</hi> or <hi>Zealots,</hi> (as they called them;)
Men that took upon them the Cause of God,
to avenge him of his Enemies; whether it were
to kill any single Person, or a Family, or a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
if they were able to compass it. They
stuck at nothing that stood in the way of their
bloody and barbarous Sect, disguised under the
mild and sacred Name of Religion.</p>
            <p>I shall not shew, nor will it be greatly mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
to tell you, what Reaks they played among
the Jews, nor what Havock they made of the
Christians of those times. I have shewn you
enough of their Way, and of their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which suits the immediate scope of my
Text.</p>
            <p>This, together with the rest that I have said,
was that measure that the Apostles of Christ
were to expect, and to receive from the Jews,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61303:9"/>
upon the account of Religion; that is, indeed,
of Tradition against Scripture.</p>
            <p>But now I come to consider the <hi>Time</hi> when
this Prophesie was to be fulfilled. I have
shewn you, that, besides the Completion in
that Age, it is as capable to be extended to
any future Age; any Age before the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
for even That lies within the reach of
these words, <hi>Venit Hora,</hi> The Hour comes, in
my Text. <hi>The Hour cometh,</hi> saith our Saviour,
<hi>when they that are in their Graves shall hear the
Voice of the Son of Man, and shall come forth,</hi>
John 5. 28. The Notation of that word <hi>then,</hi>
it is plain, is large enough to extend even till
the Resurrection.</p>
            <p>And if our Saviour spoke this, First, of the
Jews in the Apostles times; of whom should
he intend that <hi>they will</hi> do this in Future Ages?
Could he mean this of the Unbelieving Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles?
Saint <hi>Austin</hi> says, No; in his Book <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
Literas Petiliani.</hi> For, saith he, They do
not use Excommunication; nor, when they
kill, do they think that they do God good
service. What then? Could it be said of the
Jews in after-times? Much less: For they
were in no condition to kill. They have been
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61303:9"/>
killed, in every Age; both by Heathens, and
by Merciless Christians. But for them to kill
Christians, it hath not been in their Power at
any time since the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of whom then are we to understand this?
If not of Gentiles, nor of Jews, 'tis surely
meant of some kind of Christians in Future
Ages. So the same Saint <hi>Austin</hi> doth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it in his Book <hi>Contra Epistolam Gaudentii.</hi>
This, he says, is to be understood of Heretical
Christians. They will be ready to kill the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Christians, whensoever they have them
in their Power.</p>
            <p>But how shall we know who are Heretics?
We know who they are, that are given to Kill,
among Christians, upon the account of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
I dare appeal to themselves in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church; whether any, but themselves,
either Teach, or Practice this, among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
at this present Day.</p>
            <p>First, I am sure, for the Cause which these
Jews had, they also have it. They have the
same Zeal, that those Jews had, for Unwritten
Traditions. And as the Jews called theirs by
the Name of <hi>the Law,</hi> so the Papists make bold
to call theirs <hi>The Vnwritten Word of God:</hi> So
they call it expresly in the fourth Session of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61303:10"/>
the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> All that which they
chiefly contend for, is wholly founded on their
Unwritten Traditions.</p>
            <p>Run through all those Points that they have
added to the true Christian Faith. What Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
or what Colour have they for the proof
of them? For many, they do not so much as
pretend a word of Scripture. For some they
do: But, God knows, very wretchedly and
absurdly. For every one of them, the true
Bottom is nothing else but Unwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Is there any thing else for seven Sacraments
of Christs Institution? For their Picturing of
God the Father, and of the Trinity? For their
Worshipping Images? For their Denying the
Cup to their Laity? For their Doctrine of
Purgatory? For their Indulgences, and the
like? The learned Writers among them do
acknowledge, even while they maintain these
Traditions, while they endeavour to prove
them, that there is no Proof for these out of
Scripture. For all the rest of their Doctrines,
they may have some Colour; but they have no
manner of Proof for any of them, but what the
Jews had against Christ himself; and as Christ
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61303:10"/>
convinced the Jews, so Our way to convince
them is, by Scripture.</p>
            <p>But what Return have we for it? First, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
to be sure. Let any among
themselves argue any thing against their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
Let him offer to name Scripture against
it; Nay, let him own his right to read Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
'tis enough to bring him under the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Excommunication.</p>
            <p>As for us that do all this, we are cut off
from their Church at one stroke. We are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
in a heap. We are Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
in <hi>Bulla Coenae</hi> by his Holiness, in Passion
Week. 'Tis his Charity to us, at those times,
when he most solemnly betakes himself to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Death of Christ in that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And being so Excommunicated, and Accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by him, as we are; you must not wonder
at the Names which they are pleased to give
us. They call us Heretics, and Schismatics, in
their modest Appellations: Yea Infidels, and
Atheists, whensoever they please. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they do not treat us like such, that comes
next to be considered.</p>
            <p>Do I say they treat us like such? No, I
know they do much worse. Except at the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61303:11"/>
first Conquering of the <hi>Indies,</hi> when the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
killed some Millions, I say Millions, of
that poor miserable People; Except that time,
they have dealt more favourably, always, with
Heathens than with us. They kill none, usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
where they are Masters, but only Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics.
And they killed not even those, as they
do Heretics in those Countries which are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under the Dominion of Popery. As name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in <hi>Spain,</hi> and in <hi>Italy,</hi> in those Parts where
they have the Inquisition. Whosoever, there,
sides with Scripture against their Traditions,
is no sooner discovered, but hurried away to
Prison; where no Friend is suffered to come at
him, no Relief to come near him, no Hope of
better in this World. All which, taken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
make it Hell upon Earth; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for from thence there is <hi>no Redemption.</hi>
Well he may scape by Dying there: But if
ever he comes forth, 'tis to be burnt.</p>
            <p>If one dies there in the Popes Slaughter-House;
or if one scape coming thither, (which
is impossible, but by not being discovered) if
he be discovered after death, they will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him Burial. Or if he be buried first, then
they dig up his Body to be burnt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61303:11"/>
So that whether one dies in their hands, or
no; 'tis all one, he must be burnt. There is
only this difference: He that dies in their hands,
his Body is not buried, but burnt. He that
was buried before he was discovered, he is
digged up to be burnt as soon as he is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
though it be twenty or forty years
after.</p>
            <p>I could give many undeniable Instances of
all that which I have said in this matter. Few
Instances can be given to the contrary, in <hi>Spain,</hi>
or in <hi>Italy,</hi> in those parts which are under the
Inquisition.</p>
            <p>If it is not so in any other Country, yet it
was so, even there, when it was under the full
Dominion of Popery. As for instance; in
<hi>France,</hi> a little more than a hundred years
since. In our Kings Dominions, about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty years since. In the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi>
(as <hi>Grotius</hi> tells us in the first Book
of his Annals) a hundred thousand Men and
Women had suffered thus, before ever Sword
was drawn against the <hi>Spanish</hi> Government.
Not to speak of <hi>Merindole,</hi> and <hi>Cabriers,</hi> and
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> and in <hi>Austria,</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and
other Places, where this Cruelty was exercised
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61303:12"/>
so lately, in Countries not under the Full Power
of Popery.</p>
            <p>When all was theirs, before the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it was no where otherwise. How was it
possible it should be? When since the time
that it came to be a Practice of their Church,
that all whom they accounted Heretics should
be burnt; (that is since about the year 1200,
for then it began) it hath been Established by
their Laws both Ecclesiastical and Civil; It
hath been approved by, and acted in, their
General Councils; It has been taught by their
Doctors and Writers; It hath been Enacted,
and Prosecuted, and Executed, every thing by
the Pope: whose very Throne is Established,
whose Greatness has been built, the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of it laid, in the Bodies, and the Walls ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
(as I may say) with the Blood of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
and Innocent Christians.</p>
            <p>Where they have not Power to do this, and
the colour of Law; where the Government
hath been against them, or where it hath been
weakly on their side; There they have found
other ways to do the same thing; by Private
Murther; by Public Assassination; by Open
Rebellion; by such Barbarous ways as I should
not mention, for fear of being accounted a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61303:12"/>
Slanderer, but that they are notoriously known
to all the World. And in All these ways, there's
none like them, for Cruelty, among Christians.</p>
            <p>There were indeed <hi>Assassines</hi> among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Saracens; There are <hi>Deruices</hi> among the
Turks, and <hi>Saids</hi> among the <hi>Moors;</hi> Single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or Orders of Men, that are bloody enough
in other Sects: But for a whole Sect to be led
by its Principles, nay even Obliged to shed
Blood, I know none like these Traditionary
Christians. The Jews in the Apostles time, to
Them, were but Children; Their Zealots, not
to be mentioned with the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> the <hi>Cannites</hi>
of the Popish Religion.</p>
            <p>They have the same Zeal, that those had,
for their Traditions; the same Diligence to
make Proselytes; the same Cruelty to shed
Blood. Only what those acted upon the
small Stage of One Country, these do through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole World, wheresoever they dare,
and have opportunity to do it: Whether it
is to be done, by Private Murther, or by Open
War; Whether by a Foreign Sword, or by
the Civil; Whether it be upon Subjects, or
upon Princes. And in this last thing indeed,
they Out-do the Turks, and the Jews, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61303:13"/>
all other; That they spare not their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where they may hope to advantage their
Cause by it.</p>
            <p>For the Foreign Sword, they hold it not
only Lawful, but Necessary, to be drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the meer account of Religion. There is
no Kingdom in our <hi>Europaean</hi> World, but
the Pope hath given it away upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Religion; No Country but He has
made an <hi>Aceldama</hi> upon the account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>His giving Kingdoms indeed, hath been, like
the Devil's offering them to Christ; upon
Condition, that they to whom he gives them
shall <hi>fall down and Worship</hi> him. As the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
offered All, so the Pope hath given Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
though they are none of His Own;
Though He had no more Title to any One of
them, than the Devil himself has to All
Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Empire</hi> he hath given away more than
once; <hi>France</hi> many a time over; <hi>England</hi>
many and many a time, to those that would
Conquer them. And for fear that Prize should
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61303:13"/>
be too little, he hath given them Heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Bargain. He hath Commanded them
to Conquer those Kingdoms; and that, for the
Remission of their Sins.</p>
            <p>Thus he gave <hi>Navarre</hi> to the <hi>Spaniard;</hi>
who both Conquered it, and holds it to this
Day, under no other Original Title but of the
Popes Gift; and that founded upon No other
Right the Pope had to it, but what he hath
to All Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>He knows little of our Story that knows
not how he hath plaid with the Kingdoms of
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> Sometimes exciting the
Foreign Sword; sometimes stirring up Princes
against their Subjects; sometimes Arming the
Subjects against their Prince; sometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
them, and sometimes hiring them,
either to Rebellion, or to Assassination. And
in this they exceed the Turks, and all others;
who do bloody things otherwise, but not to
their own Princes; at least, not upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Religion: But to Kill Kings meerly
for Religion, I know not one Instance where
it was ever done, but for Popery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61303:14"/>
Not to insist upon old Stories. Within this
last hundred years, there have been Two Kings
of <hi>France</hi> Stabb'd by their own Popish Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
but for Favouring the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
<hi>Henry</hi> the Third in our Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s,
and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth in King <hi>Iames</hi>'s
time.</p>
            <p>For those Princes themselves, Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s
Life was attempted many times. She
was never out of Danger after the first Eleven
years of her Reign; Though all that time she
had not put One to Death of that Religion.
Afterwards indeed she did put some of them
to Death, to secure her own Life. And
knowing it was Chiefly sought by their Priests,
she forbad them to come into her Kingdoms.
And for coming in spite of her, she did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
put to Death some few of them; whom
she had cause to judge faulty otherwise. But
this Rule she observ'd, She never put any One
to Death, that would declare under his Hand,
That the Pope had no Power to take away
her Life and her Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>When King <hi>Iames</hi> came in after her, He
even Studied to oblige them. He treated them
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61303:14"/>
with all possible Indulgence. He could not
presently take away the Laws; but he put
none in Execution against them. He never
touched, either the Person, or the Purse, of
any of those whom they call Catholicks. He
forgave all that was in Arrrear from them to
Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> He refunded what Money
of theirs he found in the Exchequer. He
gave them leave to live at Home, how they
pleased, only peaceably: Or to go Abroad,
and Travel, where they pleased, without
Account: Or to take Imployment under
what Prince they pleased, without Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He Honoured all alike with Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Favour. He Knighted Many of
them; and even One<note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Everard Digby.</note> that was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in this Treason. This Gunpowder-Treason
was Encouraged, or at least Hastned,
by those Means.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I speak in the very Words of that King:
Saith he,</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">King <hi>Iames's</hi> Works, pag. 253.</note> The Papists themselves grew to
that Height of Pride in Confidence of my
Mildness, that they did directly expect, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
promise themselves, Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and Equality with my other Subjects in all
other things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:61303:15"/>
When they found that King <hi>Iames</hi> was not
for down-right Toleration, then they were
for his Blood. Nothing would satisfie them
but his Blood: And not only His, but the
Queens, and his Childrens.<note n="c" place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Works, pag 224.</note> I speak the
Words of His MAJESTIES Proclamation,
and of the Act of Thanksgiving upon this
Day: <hi>The King, the Queen, the Prince, were
all at one Thunder-Clap to be sent to Heaven
together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh Barbarous, and Horrid, and Execrable
Cruelty! How could it enter into the
Hearts of Men, but by the Instigation of the
Devil, to do such horrid things as they had
design'd! To destroy their own Prince, the
Anointed of the Lord; His Gracious Queen;
their Hopeful Children; their whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with them; and GOD knows how
many more that should come within the reach
of that Blow! The Innocent with the Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!
Yea, all Innocent; for there were none
Guilty of any thing but the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And their Religion was according to
Scripture; Only it was against the Popish
Traditions, as the Scripture it self is. The
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61303:15"/>
Scripture is against those Popish Traditions.
What then? If others do what Christ and
his Apostles did, mu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t they be such Arrant

with the same colour of Duty and Religion.
It was resolved,<note n="d" place="margin">

to excuse this; and shall lay open their
Excuses more fully elsewhere. I shall only
at this time desire you to think, what they
can say for themselves; and, much more, for
the Authors of this Wickedness.</p>
            <p>What they first say, is, That the Authors
did not come of themselves, but were drawn
into it. They were indeed led into this
Wickedness by their Religion: They acted
according to their Consciences, as the Jews
did in Crucifying Christ. They were drawn
in by none but their Spiritual Guides; by
their own High Priest, and their Rulers; by
the Pope, and the Governing Clergy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61303:16"/>
For the Minister of State whom they Now
charge with this; there was no Ground for
such a Charge, but his Vigilance. There
was not the least Intimation of any other
in those days. Both they that died, and
they that survived, accused none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
left no shadow of Guilt on any
other.</p>
            <p>But what then? Were they Rashly drawn
into it? Nothing less. It was a Deliberate
Plot. It was begun, and carried on with
great Consultation. It was some Years in
Contriving, before it was to be put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>But it was managed only by a Few Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Men, that were thrust upon it with
some great Provocations. That is a second
Excuse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But for the Provocation, take it in the
King's own Words:</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Works, p. 225.</note> There was no Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Grudge, nor no Inward Whisper, nor Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
that was any way appearing before this
Plot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:61303:16"/>
For their Condition, the chief Actors in
it were Men of Great Estates, and spent
many Thousands of Pounds in it, and were
able to have spent many more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the Number, I believe the Design it
self was known to Few: But that there was
a Design, was known to many more. King</hi>
Iames <hi>himself tells us so:</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Works, pag. 291.</note> A great
Number of my Popish Subjects, of all Ranks
and Sorts, both Men and Women, as well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
as without the Country, had a Confused No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Obscure Knowledge, that some great
Thing was to be done in that Parliament for
the Weal of the Church. Though, for Secresies
sake, they were not to be acquainted with the
Particulars.</p>
            <p>But perhaps those Many were of the more
Ignorant sort, that were drawn into it for
want of Knowledge. Nay, they knew as
much as they generally care to know. They
understood the mind of their Governours
concerning this matter. Their Spiritual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
were the Chief Men in it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:<note n="g" place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Works, p. 273.</note>
               <hi>Garnet,</hi> the very Chief Man,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61303:17"/>
was the Provincial of the Jesuits; and the
rest of his Order were the chief Instigators:
Who not only consulted, and contrived, but
<hi>formed Prayers for this Purpose; and used them
in their several Congregations for the good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of this Business.</hi> These are again the
Words of King <hi>Iames</hi> in his Book<note n="g" place="margin">Ibid. p. 291.</note>.</p>
            <p>But it will be said, The Catholicks ever
since have disowned it. I think, and doubt
not, many of them do from their Hearts.
But I assure you, 'tis disown'd by not many
of the Governing Party. Some of the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
themselves confest their Guilt at their
Death;<note n="h" place="margin">Winter, Rockwood, <hi>and</hi> Digby.</note> three of them, and no more:
The rest justified themselves, and stood in it
to the last.<note n="i" place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Works, pag 291.</note> Some of them refused to
ask any Pardon for it. One of the Jesuits
<note n="k" place="margin">Hall.</note> said, <hi>It would have been Commendable if
it had been done.</hi> A Lay-Gentleman<note n="l" place="margin">R. Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> said,
(even at his suffering) <hi>He hoped their Sons
would grow up to Revenge their Cause.</hi> One
of them,<note n="m" place="margin">Grant.</note> being advised to Repent of
that Sin, answered chearfully, <hi>He was satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
it was far from being a Sin:</hi> Nay, that
<hi>he trusted, the Merit of that Vndertaking would
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61303:17"/>
amply suffice for the Satisfaction of his Sins.</hi>
Thus they thought.</p>
            <p>What others did, it appeared after their
Deaths. Some of their Leaders are yet
esteemed no less than Martyrs in their
Church. And those Principles by which they
went are yet the very Catholic Doctrines. I
know, or believe at least, they are detested
by some Members of that Church: But they
are as boldly, and as strenuously, asserted,
by the Head of that Church, and by all the
Principal Members. They do really that,
which Christ foretold some would do in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
times, upon the Account of Religion:
<hi>They will</hi> (saith he) <hi>put you out,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The more evident this is in them, the
stronger Motive it should be to us, both
to Zeal for our Religion at all times, and
now especially to Thankfulness to God for
this Deliverance.</p>
            <p>For our Religion, we know it is from the
God of Truth; and theirs, (as far as it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
from ours) is from the Father of Lyes.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61303:18"/>
And they take his way to maintain it, if Fraud
and Violence are of the Devil; which they
are, as sure as Truth and Goodness are of
GOD.</p>
            <p>Blessed be GOD for our Religion; for
giving it, for keeping it from all Danger,
and especially from this. He deserveth no
other MERCY, that is not thankful for
this.</p>
            <p>LORD! We deserve none at all. We
deserve nothing but Judgment. We are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
even the least of thy Mercies. It was
for thy Mercy sake, for thy own sake, that
thou didst this.</p>
            <p>Oh, never let it be forgotten in our Days!
Never let it be remembred, or thought of,
but with Thanksgiving to our God! And as
the highest Motive upon Earth to those Ways
that are pleasing in his sight; To a Zeal for
his Truth, to Love and Unity among our
selves, to true Holiness in all our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:61303:18"/>
And having this Experience of GOD's
Care for his Church in these Kingdoms; let
us learn, by this, to trust him with it on all
other Occasions. We have a great Occasion
at present, and GOD knows what we are
like to have more. Let us <hi>Trust in Him,</hi>
that as He has done, so He will still deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us.</p>
            <p>But withal, Let us <hi>Keep His Way;</hi> and
not follow our Adversaries in theirs. It is
properly their Way to Kill Men for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
GOD forbid we should follow them in
it! But for those other things in which they
give us Example; for Zeal, and Activity,
and Undefatigable Diligence; as they are
Theirs in an Ill Cause, so in a Good they may
and ought to be Ours.</p>
            <p>And in these, if we cannot out-do them,
yet for shame let us not be out-done. Let
us not (as perhaps we are too apt to do)
so much relie on our Cause, as to think that
we need not defend it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Let us follow our Endeavours with
our Prayers to Almighty GOD;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:61303:19"/>
That being delivered from the Hands of all
our Enemies, we may serve Him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear:</p>
            <p>That having escaped the greatest Cruelty
on this side Hell, we may at last escape that
too; And that Living and Dying in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of his Church, we may be Partakers
of his Kingdom in Life Everlasting.</p>
