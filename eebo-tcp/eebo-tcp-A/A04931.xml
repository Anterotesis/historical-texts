            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that of al my stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
and trauayle
within the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of GOD
these twentye yeares, I haue set
forth nothing in exponing anye
portion of scripture, except this
onely rude and indigest Sermon
preached by me in the publicke
audie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce of the church of Eding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough
the day and yeare aboue
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cioned. That <hi>I</hi> did not in writ
communicate my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the scriptures, I haue euer
thought and yet thinke my selfe
<pb facs="tcp:8586:3"/>
to haue most iust reason. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
my selfe rather cald of
my God to instruct the ignorant,
comfort the sorowfull, confirme
the weake, and rebuke the proud
by tong &amp; liuelye voyce in these
most corrupt dayes, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
bokes for the age to come,
seeing that so much is written (&amp;
that by men of most singuler co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition)
and yet so little well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued:
I decreed to containe my
selfe within the bondes of that
vocation, wherevnto I founde
my selfe especially called. I dare
not denie (lest that in so doing I
should be iniurious to the giuer)
but that God hath reuealed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me secretes vnknowen to the
worlde, and also that he hath
made my tong a trumpet to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne
realmes and nations, yea
certaine great personages, of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and chaunges, when no
<pb facs="tcp:8586:3"/>
such thinges were feared, nor yet
was appearing, a portion wherof
can not the world denie (be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so blind) to be fulfilled, and
the rest (alas) I feare shall followe
with greater expedition and in
more full perfection, than my
sorowfull heart desireth. These
reuelations and assurances not
withstanding, <hi>I</hi> did euer ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steyne
to commit anye thing to
writ, contented onely to haue
obeyed the charge of him, who
commaunded me to cry. If anye
then will aske to what purpose
this onely sermon is set forth, &amp;
greater matters omitted, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
to let such as Sathan hath
not altogether blinded see, vpon
how small occasions, great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
is nowe conceyued. This
sermon is it for the which from
my bed I was called before the
Councell: and after long reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb facs="tcp:8586:4"/>
I was by some forbidden to
preach in Edingbrough so long
as the King and Queene were in
the towne. This sermon is it that
so offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>deth such as would please
the Court, and yet will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to be enimies to the truth,
that thei dare affirme that I haue
exceded the bonds of Gods mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanger.
I haue therfore faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
committed vnto writ, what
soeuer I could remember might
haue beene offensiue in that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
To the ende that aswell
the enimies of Gods truth, as the
professors of the same, may ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
note vnto me wherin I haue
offended, or at the least ceasse to
condempne me before they haue
conuicted me by Gods manifest
worde. If any man thinke it easy
vnto me to mitigate by my pen
the inconsiderate sharpenesse of
my tongue, and so can not men
<pb facs="tcp:8586:4"/>
freely iudge of that my sermon, <hi>I</hi>
answere that neyther am <hi>I</hi> so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
that <hi>I</hi> will study to abuse
the worlde, in this great light,
neyther yet so voyde of feare of
my God, that <hi>I</hi> will auowe a lye
in his owne presence. And no
lesse doe <hi>I</hi> esteeme it to be a lye,
to deny or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ceile that which in
his name <hi>I</hi> haue once pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
than to affirme that GOD
hath spoken, when his worde as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
me not of the same, for in
the publike place <hi>I</hi> consulte not
with flesh and bloud what <hi>I</hi> shall
propone to the people, but as the
spirit of my God who hath sent
me and vnto whome <hi>I</hi> must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
moueth me, so I speake,
and when I haue once pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
threatnings in his na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>e (howe
vnpleasant soeuer they be to the
world) I dare no more deny the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
than I dare deny that God hath
<pb facs="tcp:8586:5"/>
made me his messinger to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne
the inobedient of their
assured destruction. At that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
were auditours vnto me not
onely professors of the truth and
such as fauor me, but rancke pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes,
dissembled Hipocrites, &amp;
no small number of couetous
clawbaks of the new court. Now
<hi>I</hi> will appeale the conscience of
them all, as they will aunswere
in the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce of the eternal god,
that eyther they beare me record
now writing the truth, or els note
vnto me the sentences offensiue
then by me pronounced, &amp; now
ommitted in writting, for in
Gods presence <hi>I</hi> protest that so
far as memorie would serue me,
<hi>I</hi> haue written more veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tly,
than in the action <hi>I</hi> spake and
pronounced, but of purpose <hi>I</hi>
haue omitted persuasions and
exhortations which then were
<pb facs="tcp:8586:5"/>
made for alluring of suche vnto
the feare of God, whom gladly I
would haue pleased, if so I could
haue done, &amp; not haue betrayed
the manifest truth of my God.
The Lorde be mercifull vnto me
that I did not more fullye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
whatsoeuer his holy spirit
layde before me, in that text,
which I am assured the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
reader shal think I haue but
slenderlye handeled, all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>nsidered. O Lord

in thy truth, that loue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
hate impietie, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

rased as it were, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the

say) fearing these horrible cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
doth as it were, some ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
suffer himselfe and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
committed to his charge, to
be carried awaye with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pest, with out fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
resistance, than by pouring

forth his and their dolorous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playntes,
before the maiestie of
GOD, as in the 13 .17. and .18.
verse of this prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t text we may
reade. At other times he vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
resisteth the desperat tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,
and pronounceth the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
destruction of all suche, as
trouble the Churche of GOD,
which he pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ceth that God
wil multiply, euen in such time
as when it appeareth vtterly to
be exterminate. But, bycause
ther is no final rest to the whole
body, till that the head returne
to iudgement, he calleth the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
to pacience, and promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
such a visitation, as wherby
the wickednesse of the wicked
shal be disclosed, and finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced
in their owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes.</p>
            <p>These are the chiefest poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
which by the grace of God,
<pb facs="tcp:8586:9"/>
we intende more largely at thy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
present to entreate.</p>
            <p>First the Prophet sayth: O Lord our God,<note place="margin">Ver. 13.</note>,
other Lordes besydes thee haue ruled vs.</p>
            <p>This no doubte, is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the dolorous complaint
in the which he first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>playneth
of the vniuste tirannye that the
poore afflicted Israelites sustay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
during the time of their
captiuitie. True it is that the
Prophet was gathered to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in peace, before that this
extremitie appreche<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ded the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
For a hundreth yeare after
his deceasse, was not the people
lead away captiue, yet he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seing
the assurance of the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
did before hande endite
vnto them the complaynt that
after they shoulde make. But at
the firste sight it appeareth that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8586:9"/>
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>plaint hath small waight.
For what newe thing was it that
other Lordes than GOD in hys
owne person ruled them, seeing
that suche had bene their regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the beginning. For
who knoweth not that Moyses,
Aaron, &amp; Iosua, the Iudges, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell,
Dauid, and other godly
rulers, were men, and not God.
And so other Lordes than God,
ruled them in their gretest pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie.</p>
            <p>For the better vnderstanding
of this complaynte, and of the
minde of the Prophete, we must
first obserue from whence al au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
and dominion floweth<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
And secondly, to what ende po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
are appointed of God. The
which two poynts being discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
we shall the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande,
what Lordes, and what
authority rules beside God, and
<pb facs="tcp:8586:10"/>
who are they in whom God and
his mercifull presence rules.</p>
            <p>The firste is resolued to vs by
the words of the apostle, saying,
There is no power but of God.
Dauid bringeth in the eternall
God speaking to Iudges and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,<note place="margin">Psal. 82.</note>
saying, I haue sayde ye are
Gods, &amp; the sonnes of the most
highest. And Salomon in the
person of GOD, affirmeth the
same, saying: By me Kings ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne,
and Princes discerne the
thinges that are iuste. Of which
places it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, that it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
birth, influence of Starres,
election of people, force of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
not finally what soeuer can
be comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ded vnder the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of nature, that maketh the
distinction betwixt the superior
power and the inferior, or that
doth establish the royall throne
of Kings, but it is the onely and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8586:10"/>
perfect ordinance of God, who
willeth his power, terror &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
in a parte to shine in the
thrones of Kings, and in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his Iudges, and that for
the profite and comfort of man,
so that who soeuer would study
to deface that order of regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t,
that God hath established, and
by his holy worde allowed, and
bring in such a confusion, as no
difference shuld be betwyxt the
vpper powers and the subiects,
doth nothing but euert &amp; turne
vpside downe the very throne
of God, which he wil to be fixed
here vpon earth, as in the ende
and cause of this ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce more
playnly shall appeare, which is
the seconde poynte, we haue to
obserue for the better vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Prophets words and
minde.</p>
            <p>The end and cause then, why
<pb facs="tcp:8586:11"/>
God prynteth in the weake and
feble flesh of man this Image of
his own power &amp; maiesty, is not
to puffe vp flesh in opinion of it
selfe, neyther yet that the heart
of him that is exalted aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
shall be lifted vp by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
and pryde, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
others, but that he shal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that he is appoynted Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunt
to one, whose eyes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
watch vpon him, to see
and examine howe he behaueth
himself in his office,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> Saint Paul
in fewe words declareth the end
wherefore the sword is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the powers, saying, it is
to the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t of the wycked
doers, and vnto the prayse of
such as do well.</p>
            <p>Of which words it is euident
that the sword of God is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the hande of man, to
vse as it pleaseth him, but only
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8586:11"/>
to punishe vice, and maintayne
vertue, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> may liue in such
societie, as before God is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
And this is the very and
onely cause why God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
powers in this earth.</p>
            <p>For such is the furious rage of
mans corrupt nature, that vnles
seuere punishment were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and put in execution vpon
malefactours, better it were that
man shoulde liue among brute
and wilde beastes, than among
men. But at this presente I dare
not enter into the descriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of
this common place, for so shuld
I not satisfie the text, which by
gods grace I purpose to absolue.
This onely by the way I would,
that such as are placed in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
shoulde consider, whether
they raygne and rule by God, so
that God ruleth them, or if they
rule without, besides and against
<pb facs="tcp:8586:12"/>
God, of whom our Prophet here
doth complayne.</p>
            <p>If any lust to take trial of this
poynt,<note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> it is not hard: for Moses
in the election of Iudges, and of
a King, describeth, not onelye
what persones shall be chosen to
that honour, but doth also giue
to him that is elected and chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
the rule by the which he shal trie
himselfe whether God raygne in
him or not, saying: when he shal
sit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the throne of his kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
he shal write to himself an exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plar of this lawe in a boke by the
priests the Leuits, it shal be with
him and he shall reade therin all
the dayes of his life, that he may
learne to feare the Lord his god,
and to kepe all the words of this
law &amp; these statuts<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> that he may
do them, that his hart be not lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

to the right hand or to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8586:12"/>
the left.</p>
            <p>Thesame is repeated to Iosua<note place="margin">Iosua. 1.</note>
in his inanguration to the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the people by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
saying: let not the boke of

but meditate in it day &amp; night,
that thou mayst kepe and do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to al that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

be prosperous, and thou shalt do
prudently.</p>
            <p>The first thing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that god cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
of him that is called to the
honor of a king,<note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of a King or Prince.</note> is the knowlege
of his wil reuealed in his word.</p>
            <p>The second is an vpright and
willing minde to put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
suche things as God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
in his lawe, without
declyning eyther to the right, or
left hande.</p>
            <p>Kings then haue not an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

what pleaseth them,<note place="margin">The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of kings is Limmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>, but their

So that if they strike where god

they and their throne are crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and giltie of the wickednesse
that aboundeth vpon the face
of the earth, for lacke of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>O if Kings and Princes shuld
consider what accompt shall be
craued of them, as well of their
ignoraunce and misknoweledge
of Gods will, as for the neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of their office But nowe to
returne to the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.
In the person of the whole
people he doth complayne vnto
God, that the Babilonians (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
he calleth other Lordes besydes
God, both bycause of their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce
of God, and by reason
of their crueltie and inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8586:13"/>
hadde long ruled ouer them
in all rigor, without pitie or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassion
had vpon the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciente
men, and famous matro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
For they being mortall eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the people of God, sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght
by all meanes to aggrauate
their yoke, yea, vtterlye to haue
exterminate the memorie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
and of their religion, from the
face of the earth.</p>
            <p>After the first part of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous
complaynt, the Prophete
declareth the protestation of the
people, saying, neuerthelesse,
onely in thee shall we remember
thy name (others reade it, <hi>Put
wee wyll remember thee onelye and thy
name</hi>) But in the Hebrew there is
no Coniunction copulatiue in
that sentence. The minde of the
Prophete is playne, to wit, that
not withstanding the long sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
affliction, the people of
<pb facs="tcp:8586:14"/>
God declyned not to a false and
vayne religion, but remembred
God that sometime appeared to
them in his mercifull presence,
which albeit then they saw not,
yet would they still reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ber his
name, that is, they would cal to
minde the doctrine and promise
which so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>etimes they hard, albeit
in their prosperity, they did not
sufficiently glorifie God, who so
mercifully ruled in the midst of
them. The temptation no doubt
of the whole Isralites was gret in
those dayes. They were caryed
captiues from the land of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
which was to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the gage &amp;
pledge of Gods fauour towardes
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. For it was the inheritaunce
that God promised to Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> &amp;
to his seede for euer. The league
&amp; couenant of Gods protection
appeared to haue beene broken.
They lamentably co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>playne that
they sawe not their accustomed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8586:14"/>
signes of Gods merciful prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce.
The true prophets were fewe, &amp;
the abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s vsed in Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
were exceding many. And so
it might haue apered to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, that
in vayne it was, that they were
called the posteritie of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
or that euer they had receyued
law or form of right religion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
god. That we may the better fele
it in our selues, the temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, I
say, was eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> such, as if God shuld
vtterly destroy al order &amp; policy
that this day is withi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> his church,
that the true preaching of the
worde should be suppressed. The
right vse of sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts abolished,
Idolatry &amp; papistical abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
erected vp again. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
that our bodies should be
take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> prisoners by Turks or other
manifest enimies of God &amp; of al
Godlynesse<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Such I say was their
temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. How notable then is
this their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that in bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dage
<pb facs="tcp:8586:15"/>
they make, to wit, that they wil
remember God onely, albeit he
hath appeared to turne his face
from them, they will remember
hys name, and will cal to minde
the deliuerance promised.</p>
            <p>Hereof haue we to consider
what is our duetie, if God bring
vs (as for oure offences and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse
iustely he may) to
the like extremitie. This confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is not the fayre flattering
wordes of hypocrites, lying and
bathing in their pleasures, but it
is the mightye operation of the
spirite of God, who leaueth not
his owne destitute of some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in their most desperate cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.<note place="margin">The dutie of Gods people</note> This is then oure duety,
not onely to confesse our god in
the time of peace and quietnes,
but he chiefely craueth that we
auowe him, in the middeste of
his and our enimies. And this is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8586:15"/>
to doe, but it behoueth that the
spirite of God worke in vs aboue
all power of nature. And thus we
ought earnestlye to meditate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the battayle rise more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which appeareth not to be
farre of, but now must we enter in
somewhat more deepely to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
these iudgements of God.</p>
            <p>This people entreated as we
haue heard, was the onely people
vpon the face of the earth, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
God was rightly knowen, among
them onely were his lawes, sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuts,

vsed, and put in practise. They
onely inuocated his name, and to

then shoulde be the cause, that he

of the bookes of kings and cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles
declare this in more playne
words, saying: the Lorde sent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

desiring of them to retourne vnto
the Lorde, and to amende their
wicked wayes (for he would haue
spared his people and his taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle)
but they mocked his seruants,
and woulde not retourne vnto the

the dayes of Ieroboam. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lorde God abhorred the

Nowe haue we to take
heede how we should vse the good
lawes of God, that is, his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

thou hast visited and scattered them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed all their memorie.</p>
            <p>Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> this .14. verse vnto the end of
the .19. it apeareh that the Prophet
obserueth no order, yea, that he
speaketh thinges directly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
one to another. For first he
sayth the dead shal not liue. After,
he affirmeth, thy dead men shall
lyue.<note place="margin">Verse. 15.</note> Secondly he sayth, thou hast
visited and scattered them, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
all their memorie. Imedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
thereafter he sayth, thou hast
increased the natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> O Lord, thou
haste increased the nation. They
haue visited thee, and haue pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
forth a prayer before thee.</p>
            <p>Who, I say, woulde not thinke,
<pb facs="tcp:8586:19"/>
that these are thinges not onely
spoken forth of good order and
purpose, but also manifestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning
one to another. For, to
liue, and not to liue, to be so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
that no memoriall remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.
And to be so increased, that
the coastes of the earth shal be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished,
seme to importe playne
contradiction. For remouing of
this doubt, and for better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the Prophetes minde,
we must vnderstand that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
had to doe with diuers forts
of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. He had to do with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured
&amp; manifest enimies of Gods
people, the Caldes or Babiloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
euen suche as professe Christ
Iesus, haue to doe with the Turke
and Sarazens. He had to doe with
the sede of Abraham, wherof there
were three sorts. The tenne tribes
all degenerate from the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping, and corrupted with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8586:19"/>
as this daye, are our pestilent
papistes in al realmes and nations.</p>
            <p>There rested onely the tribe of
Iuda and Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, where the forme
of true religion was obserued, the
lawe taught, and ordinaunces of
god outwardly kept, but yet there
were in that body (I meane in the
bosome of the visible Church) a
great number that were hipocrits,
as this day yet are among vs, that
doe professe the Lorde Iesus and
haue refused papistrie, not a fewe
that were lycentious lyuers, some
that had tourned their backe to
God, that is had forsaken al true
religion, and some that liued a
most abhominable life,<note place="margin">Ezech. 8.</note> as Ezechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
sayeth in his vision. And yet
there were some godlye as a fewe
wheat cornes oppressed and hid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>g
the multitude of such chaffe.
Nowe according to this diuersitie,
the Prophete kepeth diuers pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
<pb facs="tcp:8586:20"/>
and yet in moste perfecte
order.</p>
            <p>And first after the first part of the
complaint of the afflicted, as we
haue heard, in vehemencie of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
he bursteth forth against all
the proude enimies of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
all such as trouble them, and
against all such as mocke and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
God, and sayth: the dead shal
not liue. The proud Giants shall
not arise. Thou hast scattered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
and destroyed their memoriall. In
which wordes he fighteth against
the present temptation, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous
estate of Gods people, and
against the insolent pride of suche
as oppressed them, as the Prophet
should say. O ye troublers of Gods
people, howsoeuer it appeareth
to you in this your bloudy rage,
that God regardeth not your cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie,
not considereth not what
violence ye doe to his pore afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8586:20"/>
yet shal ye be visited, yea, your
carcases shal fal and lye as stinking
carions vpon the face of the earth,
ye shal fal without hope of life, or
of a blessed resurrection. Yea, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
ye gather your substance
&amp; augment families, ye shal be so
scattered, that ye shal leaue no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall
of you to the posterities to
come, but that which shal be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
and odious.</p>
            <p>Hereof haue the tirauntes their
admonition, &amp; the aflicted church
inestimable comfort. The tiraunts
that now doe oppresse, shal receiue
the same end that they which haue
passed before, that is, they shal dye
and fal with shame without hope
of resurrection as is aforesayd, not
that they shall not arise to their
owne confusion &amp; iust condemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
but that they shal not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
power to trouble the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of God, neyther yet shal the
<pb facs="tcp:8586:21"/>
wicked arise as Dauid sayth, in the
councell of the iust.</p>
            <p>Now haue the wicked their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
their thrones, &amp; finally hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for the most part of al things
that are vpon the face of the earth,
but the pore serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts of God are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
vnworthy of mens presence,
yea they are more vile before these
proude tyraunts, than is very dirt
and mire that is troden vnder fote.
But in that glorious resurrection,
this estate shal be changed. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
shal such as now by their abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
liuing and crueltie,<note place="margin">Apoca.</note> destroy
the earth &amp; molest gods children,
see him whome they haue pearced.
They shal see the glory of such, as
now they persecute, to their terror
and euerlasting confusion. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
hereof ought to make
vs patient in the dayes of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and so to comfort vs, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
we see tiraunts in their blind rage
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8586:21"/>
tread vnder fote the saints of god,
that vtterlye we dispaire not, as
that there were neyther wisedom,
iustice, nor power aboue in the
heauens to represse such tirannie,
and to redresse the dolors of the
vniustly afflicted. No brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, let
vs be assured that the right hand
of the Lorde will change the state
of thinges that be most desperate.
In our God there is wisedome and
power in a moment to change the
ioy and mirth of our enimies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
euerlasting mourning, and our
sorrowes into ioye and gladnesse
that shall haue no ende.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore in these appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
calamities (and maruell not
that I say calamities apparant, for
he that seeth not a fier begonne,
that shal burne more than we loke
for, vnlesse God of his mercye
quench it, is moore than blinde.)
Yet I say, let vs not be discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb facs="tcp:8586:22"/>
but with vnfained repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tance,
let vs retourne to the Lorde our
God, let vs accuse and condemne
our former negligence, and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly
depende vpon his promised
deliuerance, and so shal our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
sorrowes, be conuerted into
ioye euerlasting, the doubt that
might be moued concerning the
destruction of those whome God
exalteth, shall be discussed if time
wil suffer, after that we haue passed
throughout the text. Now proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the Prophet and sayth.</p>
            <p>Thou hast increased the nations,<note place="margin">Verse. 15.</note> O Lorde,
thou hast increased the nation, thou art made
glorious, thou hast inlarged all the coastes of
the earth.</p>
            <p>Lorde in trouble.<note place="margin">Verse. 16.</note> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In these wordes the Prophet gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
consolation to the afflicted,
assuring them that howe horrible
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8586:22"/>
soeuer that desolation shoulde be,
yet shoulde the seede of Abraham
be so multiplyed, that it should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish
the coasts of the earth. Yea,
that God should be more glorified
in their dispersion, than he was du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of their prosperity:
This promise no doubt was incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
when it was made. For who
coulde haue bene persuaded that
the destruction of Ierusalem, should
haue bene the meanes, wherby the
nation of the Iewes shoulde haue
bene increased, seing that muche
rather it appeared that the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of Ierusalem, shoulde haue
beene the verie abolishing of the
seede of Ahraham. But we muste
consider to what ende it was that
God reuealed himselfe to Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
and what is contayned in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the multiplication of his
seede, and of the benediction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
therto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8586:23"/>
First God reuealed himselfe to
Abraham, and that by the meanes
of his word, to let al flesh after vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande,
that without God first
cal man, and reueale himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, that flesh can doe nothing
but rebell against God.<note place="margin">

                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>osu. 24.</note> For Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
no doubt was an Idolater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that God called him from Vr
of the Caldeis. The promise was
made that the seede of Abraham
should be multiplyed as the starres
of heauen,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> and as the sande of the
sea, which is not simply to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanded
of his natural seede, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe
it was sometymes greatly
increased, but rather of suche as
shoulde become the spiritual seede
of Abraham, as the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth:
Now if we be able to proue
that the right knowledge of God,
his wisedome, iustice, mercye, and
power, was more amply declared
in their captiuitie, than euer it was
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8586:23"/>
at any tyme before: then can we
not deny, but that God euen when
to mans iudgement he had vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rased them from the face of the
earth, did increase the nation of
the Iewes, so that he was glorified
in them, and did extend the coastes
of the earth for their habitation.
And for the better vnderstanding
hereof, let vs shortly try the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
from their captiuitie to their
deliuerance, and after the same, to
the comming of the Messias. It is
no doubt, but that Sathan inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the dispersion of the Iewes
so to haue prophaned the whole
seede of Abraham, that among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
should neyther haue remayned the
true knowledge of God, nor yet
the spirit of sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. But that
all shoulde haue come to a like ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce
and contempt of God.</p>
            <p>For I pray you, for what purpose
was it, that Daniel<note place="margin">Daniell. 1.</note> and his fellowes
<pb facs="tcp:8586:24"/>
were taken into the Kings court,
were commaunded to be fed at the
Kings table, and were put to the
scholes of their diuines, South say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Astrologians? it maye be
thought that it proceeded of the
Kinges humanitie, and of a zeale
that he had, that they shoulde be
brought vp in vertue &amp; good lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
And I doubt not, but it was
so vnderstanded of a great number
of the Iewes. But the secret prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of the Diuell, was vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of Danyell, when he refused
to defyle himselfe with the kings
meat, which was forbidden to the
seede of Abraham in the lawe of
their God. Well, God beginneth
shortly thereafter to shew himselfe
myndefull of his promise made by
his Prophete. And he beginneth
to trouble Nabuchodonezar him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
by shewing to him a vision in
his dreame, which did the more
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8586:24"/>
trouble him, bicause he could not
forget the terrour of it. Neyther
yet coulde he remember what the
vision, and the parcels therof were.
Wherupon were called al diuines,
Interpretors of dreames, &amp; South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers,
of whom the King demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
if thei could let him vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d
what he had dreamed. But while
that they answere, that such a ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
vsed not to be demaunded of
any Southsayer or Magitian: For
the resolution thereof onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained
to the Gods, whose ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
was not with men: the
charge was giuen, that they all
should be slayne. And amongst the
rest Daniell<note place="margin">Daniell. 2.</note> was sought (whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie,
the diuel most enuied) to
haue suffered the same iudgement.
He reclaymeth and asketh tyme to
disclose that secret. (I onely touch
the historie, to let you see by what
meanes God increaseth his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
<pb facs="tcp:8586:25"/>
which being grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ted, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
is reueled vnto him. He sheweth
the same vnto the king, with the
true interpretation of it. Adding,
that the knowledge thereof came
not from the starres, but only fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
the God of Abraham, who onely
was, and is, the true God<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> which
thing vnderstanded, the king burst
forth in his confession, saying, of
a truth your God is the moste ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
of al Gods. And he is Lord
of kinges and onely he that reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the secretes, seeing that thou
couldest open this secret.</p>
            <p>And when the king after, puffed
vp in pride by the counsell of his
wicked nobilitie, would make an
Image, before the which he would
that al tongues and nations subiect
to him should make adoration, &amp;
that Sydrack, Misacke and Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nago,
woulde not obey his vniust
commaundement, &amp; so were cast
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8586:25"/>
in the flaming furnace of fyre, and
yet by Godes Angels were so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,
that no smell of fier remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in their persons nor garments:
this same king giueth a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
confession, saying, the Lord
God of Sydrack, Misack &amp; Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nago
is to be praysed, who hath
sent his Angels and deliuered his
worshippers, that put their trust in
him, who haue done against the
kings co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maundement, who haue
rather giuen their owne bodyes to
torment,<note place="margin">Daniell. 3.</note> than that they woulde
worship another God except their
owne God. By me therfore is there
made a decree, that whosoeuer shal
blaspheme the God of Sydrack,
Misack &amp; Abednago, that he shall
be cut in pieces, and his house shal
be made detestable.</p>
            <p>Thus we se how God began euen
almoste in the beginning of their
captiuitye, to notifie his name,
<pb facs="tcp:8586:26"/>
to multiply his knowledge, &amp; set
forth aswel his power, as his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
&amp; true worshipping, by those
that were taken prisoners, yea that
were dispised and of all men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempned.
so that the name &amp; feare
of the God of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, was neuer
before notified to so many realmes
&amp; nations. This wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>derous worke
of God proceeded from one Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
to another. For Daniel being
promoted to great honor by Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
king of Perses and Medes, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
into a desperat dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ger. For he
was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mitted to priso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> among Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Daniell. 6.</note>
bicause that he was deprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
breaking the kings iniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
not that the king desired the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of Gods seruants, but bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the corrupt Idolaters, that
in hatred of Daniell had procured
that lawe to be made, vrged the
king against his nature. But God
by his Angell did stop the Lyons
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8586:26"/>
mouthes, and so preserued his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant.
Which considered with the
soddaine destruction of Daniels
enimies by the same Lyons, king
Daryus besides his owne confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wrote to all people, tongues,
and nations after this forme. It is
decreed by me that in all the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
of my kingdom men shal
feare and reuerence the God of
Danyell, bicause he is the liuing
God, abiding for euer, whose king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
shall not be destroyed, and
his dominion remayneth, who sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
and deliuereth, and sheweth
signes and wonders in heauen and
in earth: who hath deliuered Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell
from the Lyons.</p>
            <p>This knowledge was yet further
increased in the dayes of Cyrus,
who giuing freedome to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
to returne to their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyue
cuntry, giueth this confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.
Thus sayth Cyrus the king of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,
<pb facs="tcp:8586:27"/>
all the kingdomes of the
earth hath the Lorde God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
giuen vnto me,<note place="margin">1. Esd. 1.</note> and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
me that a house be built
to him in Ierusalem, which is in
Iuda. Whosoeuer therefore of you
that are of his people, let the Lord
his God be with him, and let him
passe vp to Ierusalem, and let him
builde the house of the Lord God
of Israell, for he only is God that
is in Ierusalem. Time will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to intreate the poyntes of this
confession, neyther yet did I for
that purpose adduce the historie.
But onely to let vs see howe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantlye
God kept his promise in
increasing of his people, and in
augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ting of his true knowledge,
when that both they that were the
seede of Abraham, and that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they professed appeared
vtterly to haue bene extinguished
aboue mens expectation, I say, he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8586:27"/>
brought fredome out of bondage,
light out of darkenesse, and lyfe
out of death. I am not ignoraunt
that the building of the temple &amp;
reparation of the walles of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
were long stayed, so that the
worke had many enimies. But so
did the hande of God preuayle in
the ende, that a decree was giuen
by Daryus (by him I suppose that
succeded to Cambises) not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that all things necessarie for the
building of the temple and for
the sacrifices that were to be there
brent,<note place="margin">1. Esd. 6.</note> shoulde be ministred vpon
the kings charges: but also, that
whosoeuer shuld hinder that work,
or change that decree, that a balke
should be taken out of his house,
and that he should be hanged ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon.
Yea that his house should be
made a donghil: and therto he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a prayer saying.<note place="margin">A prayer.</note> the God of
heauen, who hath placed his name
<pb facs="tcp:8586:28"/>
there, roote out euerye king and
people (O that kings and nations
should vnderstande) that shall put
his hande eyther to change or to
hurte this house of God that is in
Ierusalem, and so in dispite of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
was the temple builded, the
walles repayred, and the city in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited,
and in the moste desperat
daungers, it was preserued, til that
the Messias promised, the glory of
the seconde temple came, many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
himselfe to the worlde, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
and rose againe according to
the scriptures. And so by sending
forth his gospell from Ierusalem,
did replenish the whole earth with
the true knowledge of God, and so
did God in perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> increase the
nation aud the spirituall seede of
Abraham.</p>
            <p>Wherefore deare brethren, we
haue no small consolation, if the
estate of all thinges be this daye
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8586:28"/>
rightly considered, we see in what
furie and rage the worlde for the
moste parte is nowe raised against
the pore Church of Iesus Christ,
vnto the which, he hath proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
liberty after this feareful bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of that spirituall Babylon, in
the which we haue beene holden
captiues of longer space, than Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell
was prisoner in Babylon it
selfe. For if we shall consider vpon
the one parte the multitude of
those that liue without God: and
vpon the other parte, the blinde
rage of the pestilent papistes, what
shal we think of the small number
of them that do professe Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
but that they are as a poore
sheepe already seazed in the clawes
of the Lyon, yea, that they &amp; the
true religion which they professe,
shall in a moment vtterly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed.</p>
            <p>But against this fearefull temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb facs="tcp:8586:29"/>
let vs be armed with the
promise of our god, to wit, that he
wil be the protector of his church,
yea that he will multiply it, euen
when to mans iudgement, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
vtterly to be exterminate.
This promise hath our God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in the multiplication of
Abrahams seede, in preseruation
of it when Sathan labored vtterly
to haue destroied it, in deliuerance
of the same as we haue heard from
Babilon. He hath sent his sonne
Christ Iesus clad in our flesh, who
hath tasted of all our infirmities,
(sinne except) who hath promised
to be with vs to the ende of the
worlde. He hath further kept pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
in publication, yea in the res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titution
of his gloryous gospell.
Shall we then thinke that he will
leaue his church destitute in this
moste daungerous age? Onely lee
vs sticke to his truth and studye to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8586:29"/>
conforme our lyues to the same,
and he shall multiply his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and increase his people, but
now let vs heare what the Prophet
sayth more.</p>
            <p>Lorde in trouble haue they visited thee,<note place="margin">Verse. 16.</note>
they poured out a prayer when they chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
was vpon them.</p>
            <p>The Prophet meaneth that such
as in the time of quietnesse did not
rightly regard God nor his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
were compelled by sharpe
corrections to seeke God, yea by
cryes and dolorous complayntes,
to visit him. True it is that suche
obedience deserueth small praise
before men, for who can prayse or
accept that in good parte which
commeth as it were of mere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion.
And yet rare it is that any
of Gods children doe giue vnsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
obedience vntill the hande of
God turne them. For if quietnesse
<pb facs="tcp:8586:30"/>
and prosperitie make them not
vtterly to forget their duety both
towardes God and man, as Dauid
for a season, yet it maketh them
carelesse, insolent, and in manye
things vnmindeful of those things
that God chiefly craueth of them,
which imperfection espied, and
the daunger that thereof might
ensewe, our heauenly father visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the sinnes of his children, but
in the rodde of his mercye, by the
which they are moued to retourne
to their God, to accuse their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
negligence, and to promise
better obedience in all times ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note>
as Dauid confesseth saying,
before I fell in affliction I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stray,
but now will I kepe thy sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuts.</p>
            <p>But yet for the better vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Prophetes minde, we
may consider how God doth visit
man, and howe man doth visit
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8586:30"/>
God, and what difference there is,
betwixt the visitation of God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the reprobate, and his visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vpon the chosen.</p>
            <p>God sometymes visiteth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
in his hote displeasure,
pouring vpon them his plagues
for their long rebellion, as we haue
heard before, that he visited the
proud, and destroyed their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
Other tymes, God is sayde to
visit his people being in affliction,
to whome he sendeth comforte or
promise of deliuerance, as he did
visit the seede of Abraham, being
oppressed in Egipt: and Zacharie
sayth, that God had visited his
people and sent vnto them hope
of deliueraunce, when Iohn the
Baptist, was borne. But of none
of these visitations speaketh our
Prophet here, but of that onely
which we haue already touched,
to wit, when that God layeth his
<pb facs="tcp:8586:31"/>
correction vpon his owne childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
to call them from the venemous
beastes of this corrupt worlde, that
they sucke not in ouer greate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance,
the poyson therof, &amp;
doth as it were, weane them, from
their mothers paps, that they may
learne to receyue other norishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t.
True it is that this weaning (or
spaning as we terme it) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleasure, is a thing straunge to
the flesh, and yet it is a thing so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Gods children, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they be weaned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the world, they can neuer
feede vpon that delectable milke
of Gods eternall veritie. For the
corruption of the one doth eyther
hinder the other to be receyued, or
else so trobleth the whole powers
of man, that the soule can neuer
so digest the truth of God, as that
he ought to doe.</p>
            <p>Albeit this appeareth harde, yet
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8586:31"/>
it is most euident. For what liquor
can we receyue from the breasts of
the world, but that which is in the
worlde, and what that is, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
Iohn teacheth,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2.</note> saying: what
soeuer is in the world, is either the
lustes of the eyes, the lustes of the
fleshe, or the pride of lyfe. Nowe
seeing that these are not of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but of the worlde, howe can
it be, that our soules can feede vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
chastitie, temperance, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie,
so longe, as that our sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maks
are replenished with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of these vices.</p>
            <p>Now so it is that willingly fleshe
can neuer refuse these forenamed,
but rather still delyghteth it selfe
in euery one of them, yea, in them
all as the examples are but to eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p>It behoueth therefore that God
himself shal violently pul his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
from these venemous breasts,
<pb facs="tcp:8586:32"/>
that when they lacke the liquor &amp;
poyson of the one<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> they may visit
him and learne to be nourished of
him. Oh if the eies of worldly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
shoulde be opened, that they
might see with what humor and
lyquor their soules are fed, while
that their whole delight consisteth
in pryde, ambition, and lustes of
the stinking flesh. We vnderstande
then how God doth visite men, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
by his seuere iudgementes, as
by his mercifull visitation of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance
from trouble or by brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
trouble vpon his chosen for
their humiliation. And now it res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
               </gap>th
to vnderstand howe man visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
God: man doth visite God,
when he appeareth in his presence,
be it to the hearing of his worde, or
to the participation of his sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
as the people of Israell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the obseruation of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bothes
and dayly oblations were
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8586:32"/>
commaunded thrice a yeare to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
them selues before the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce
of the tabernacle, and as we doe, as
often as we present our selues to
the hearing of the worde. For there
is the fotestole, yea, there is the face
and throne of God himself, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
the gospell of Iesus Christ
is truely preached, and his sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
rightly ministred.</p>
            <p>But men maye on this sort visite
God hipocritically, for they maye
come for the fashion, they maye
heare with deafe eares, yea they
may vnderstand, and yet neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyne
with themselues to obey
that, which God requyreth. And
let such me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> be assured that he (who
searcheth the secrets of hearts) wil
be aue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ged of al such. For nothing
can be to God more odyous, than
to mock him in is owne presence.
Let euery man therefore examine
himselfe, with what minde, and
<pb facs="tcp:8586:33"/>
what purpose, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>meth to heare
the worde of God, yea with what
care he heareth it, and what testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
his heart giueth vnto him,
when that God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maundeth ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and forbiddeth impietie.</p>
            <p>Repinest thou when God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
obedience? Thou hearest to
thine owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dempnation. Moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
thou at Gods threatenings?
Thou shalt feele the weight and
truth of them, albeit to late, when
flesh &amp; bloude cannot deliuer thee
from his hande. But the visitation
(wherof our Prophet speaketh,) is
only proper to the sonnes of God,
who in the tyme when God taketh
from them the pleasures of the
world, or sheweth his angry coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce
vnto them, haue their
recourse vnto him, and confessing
their former negligence with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
hearts cry for his mercy. This
visitation is not proper to all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8586:33"/>
but appertaineth onely to
Gods children. For the reprobate
can neuer haue accesse to Goddes
mercye in time of their tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that bicause they abuse as
well his long pacience, as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde
benefits they receiue from
his handes. For as the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
heretofore sayth, let the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
obtaine mercy, yet shal he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
learne wisedome, but in the
lande of righteousnesse, that is
where the very knowledge of God
aboundeth, he will doe wickedly,
which is a cryme aboue all others
abhominable. For to what ende is
it that God erecteth his throne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
vs? but for that we shoulde
feare him. Why doth he reueale
his holy will vnto vs? but that we
shoulde obey it. Why doth he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
vs from trouble? but that we
shuld be witnesses vnto the world,
that he is gracious, and mercifull.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8586:34"/>
Nowe when that men hearing
their duety &amp; knowing what God
requireth of them doe malepertly
fight against al equitie and iustice,
what I pray you doe they else but
make manifest warre against God,
yea when they haue receiued from
God suche deliuerance, that they
cannot deny, but that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
hath in his great mercye visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, and yet that they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
wicked euen as before. What
deserue they? but effectually to be
giuen ouer into a reprobate sence,
that hedlong they may runne to
ruine both of body and soule. It is
almost incredible that man should
be so enraged against God, that
neyther his plagues, nor yet his
mercy shewed, should moue them
to repentaunce, but bicause the
scriptures beareth witnesse of the
one, and the other. Let vs cease to
meruell, and let vs firmely beleue
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8586:34"/>
that such things as haue bene, are
euen presently before our eyes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
manye blinded by affection
can not see them.</p>
            <p>Ahab as in the boke of the kings
is written, receyued many notable
benefits of the hande of God, who
did visit him in diuers sortes, some
tymes by his plagues, sometimes
by his worde, and sometymes by
his merciful deliuerance. He made
him King: and for the Idolatry v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by him and by his wife, he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
whole Israell by famyne. He
reuealed to him his will and true
religion by the Prophet Helias, he
gaue vnto him sundry deliueran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but one moste speciall, when
proude Benhadab came to besiege
Samaria, and was not content to
receiue Ahabs gold, siluer, sonnes,
daughters, and wyues, but also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
that his seruaunts shoulde
haue at their pleasure whatsoeuer
<pb facs="tcp:8586:35"/>
was delectable in Samaria: true it
is, that his elders, and people wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him not to heare the proude
tirant. But who made vnto him
the promise of deliuerance? and
who appointed and put his armye
in order, who assured him of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie.
The Prophet of God onely,
who assured him, that by the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes
of the Princes of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces,
who in number were onely
232 he should deface that great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
in the which there were .32.
Kings with all their forces: As the
Prophete of God promised, so it
came to passe. Victorie was obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
not once only, but twice, and
that by the mercifull visitation of
the Lorde.</p>
            <p>But howe did Ahab visite God
againe<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> for his great benefit recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
Did he remoue his Idolatry,
did he correct his Idolatrous wife
Iesabel? No we find no such thing,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8586:35"/>
but the one, and the other, we find
to haue continued &amp; increased in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>former
impietie.<note place="margin">1. Reg. 22.</note> But what was the
ende hereof? The last visitation of
God was, that dogges licked the
bloud of the one,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 9.</note> and did eate the
flesh of the other. In fewe wordes
then we may vnderstand, what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
there is betwixt the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of God vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the reprobate,
and his visitation vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> his chosen.
The reprobate are visited, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
truly humbled, nor yet amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
The chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> being visited, they
sobbe, and they cry vnto God for
mercy (which obtained) they mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
Gods name, and after declare
the fruites of repentaunce. Let vs

that we may stoupe vnder his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful

<pb facs="tcp:8586:36"/>
him when he correcteth vs. And
so shall we knowe in experience,
that our cryes &amp; complaintes were
not in vayne, but let vs heare what
the Prophet sayth further.</p>
            <p>Lyke as a woman (sayth he) with childe
that draweth neere to the trauayle,<note place="margin">Verse. 17.</note> is in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and cryeth in her paines, so haue we bene
in thy sight. O Lorde, we haue conceyued, we
haue borne in vayne, as thoughe we shoulde
haue brought forth the winde.</p>
            <p>Saluations were not made to the earth,
neyther,<note place="margin">Verse. 18.</note> did the Inhabitants of the earth fal.</p>
            <p>This is the seconde parte of the
Prophets complaint, in the which
he in the person of Gods people
complayneth, that of their great
affliction there appeared no ende.
This same similitude is vsed by our
master Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Iohn. 16.</note> for when he
speaketh of the troubles of hys
church, he compareth them to the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8586:36"/>
paynes of a woman trauayling in
her childe birth. But it is to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ende. For there he promiseth
exceding and permanent ioy, after
a sort, thoughe it appeare trouble.
But here is the trouble long &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement,
albeit the fruite of it was
not sodainely espied. He speaketh
no doubt of that long &amp; dolorous
tyme of their captiuitie, in the
which they continually trauayled
for delyuerance, but obtained it
not before the compleate ende of
70 yeares. During the which time,
the earth, that is the land of Iuda,
which sometymes was sanctified
vnto God, but was then giuen to
be prophaned by wicked people,
gat no helpe. Nor perceyued any
deliuerance. For the Inhabitants
of the world fell not, that is, the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes
and oppressors of gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
were not taken away, but still
remayned and continued blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
<pb facs="tcp:8586:37"/>
of God an troublers of his
church. But bicause I perceiue the
houres to passe more swiftly then
they haue done at other tymes, I
mind to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tract that which resteth
of this text into certayne points.</p>
            <p>The Prophet first fighteth against the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
desperation.<note place="margin">Verse.19. &amp;. 20.</note> After be introduceth God
himselfe calling vpon his people. And last of
all he assureth his afflicted, that God will
come, and require accompt of all the bloude
thirstie tirants of the earth.</p>
            <p>First fighting against the present despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Verse. 19.</note>
he sayth, thy dead shall liue, euen my
bodye (or with my body shall they arise,) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
and sing ye that dwell in the dust. For
thy dew is as the dew of herbes.</p>
            <p>The Prophere here pierseth
throughe all impedimentes that
nature coulde obiect. And by the
victorie of faith, he ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>meth,
not onely the common enimies;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8586:37"/>
but the great and last enimie of al,
to wit, death it self. For this would
he say, Lorde I see nothing to thy
chosen, but miserie, to follow mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie,
and one affliction to succede
another, yea in the ende I see, that
death shal deuour thy dearest chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
But yet, O Lorde, I see thy
promise to be true, and thy loue to
remaine towards thy chosen, euen
when death appeareth to haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
them. For thy deade shall
liue, yea not onely shall they liue,
but my verie dead careasse shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise.
And so I see honor and glory
to succede this temporall shame. I
see ioye permanent to come after
trouble, order to spring out of this
terrible confusion, and finallye, I
see that lyfe shal deuoure death, so
that death shall be destroyed, and
so thy seruauntes shall haue lyfe.
This I say is the victorie of faith,
when in the middest of deathe
<pb facs="tcp:8586:38"/>
throughout the light of Goddes
worde the afflicted see lyfe: Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
in the tyme of quietnesse &amp;
prosperitie can generally confesse
that God is true in his promises,
but bring them to the extremitie,
and there ceasseth the hipocrite
further to trust in God than he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
naturall meanes whereby God
vseth to worke. But the true faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
when all hope of naturall
meanes fayleth, then flye they to
God himselfe, and to the truth of
his promise, who is aboue nature,
yea whose workes are not so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to the ordinarie course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that when nature fayloth, his
power and promise fayle also ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
            <p>Let vs further observe that the
Prophete here speaketh not of all
deade in generall, but sayth, thy
dead O Lorde shall liue. In which
wordes he maketh difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8586:38"/>
those that dye in the Lorde,
and those that dye in their naturall
corruption and in olde Adam. Die
in the Lord can none except those
that liue in him (I meane of those
that attaine to the yeares of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
and none liue in him, except
those that with the Apostle can say
I liue, not I but Christ Iesus liueth
in me. The lyfe that now I liue, I
haue by the faith of the sonne of
God.<note place="margin">Gala. 2.</note> Not that I meane that the
faithfull haue at all houres suche
sense of the lyfe euerlasting; that
they feare not the deathe and the
troubles of this lyfe, no not so, for
the faith of all Goddes children is
weake, yea and in manye thinges
imperfect. But I meane, that such
as in death, and after death shall
liue, muste communicate in this
lyfe with Iesus Christ, and must be
regenerate by the sede of lyfe. That
is,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.</note> by the worde of the liuing and
<pb facs="tcp:8586:39"/>
euerlasting God, which whosoeuer
dispiseth, refuseth lyfe and ioye
euerlasting.</p>
            <p>The Prophet transferreth all the
promises of God to him selfe, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Euen my dead body shal arise,
and imediately after, giueth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t
&amp; charge to the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
in the dust, that is, to the dead
carcasses of those that were depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(for the spirit and soule of man
dwelleth not in the dust) that they
should awake, they should sing and
reioyce. For they should arise and
spring vp from the earth, euen as
the herbes doe, after they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
the dew from aboue.</p>
            <p>Tyme will not suffer that these
particulars be so largely intreated,
as they merit, &amp; as I gladly would,
And therefore let vs first consider,
that the Prophet in tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sferring the
power and promise of God to him
self, doth not vendicate to himself,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8586:39"/>
any perticular prerogatiue aboue
the people of God, as that he alone
should liue and arise, and not they
also. But he doth it to let them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande
that he taught a doctrine
whereof he was certayne, yea and
whereof they shoulde haue expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
after his death. As he should
say, my words appeare to you now
to be incredible, but the daye shall
come, that I shal be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> you,
my carcas shall be inclosed in the
bosome of the earth, and therfore
shall ye be ledde away captiues to
Babylon, where ye shall remayne
many dayes and yeares, as it were
buryed in your sepulchres.</p>
            <p>But then cal to minde that I sayd
vnto you before hand that my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
shall arise. Euen so shall ye rise
from your graues out of Babylon,
and be restored to your owne cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and citie of Ierusalem. This I
doubt not, is the true meaning of
<pb facs="tcp:8586:40"/>
the Prophet. The charge that he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
to the dwellers in the dust, is
to expresse the power of Goddes
worde. Whereby, he not onely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
life where death appa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>antly
had preuayled, but also by it he
calleth things that are not, euen as
if they were. Ture it is that the
Prophete Isaiah sawe not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of Ierusalem, much lesse
could he se the restitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of it with
his corporall eyes, but he leaueth
this, as it were, in testament with
them, that when they were in the
extremitie of all bondage, they
should call to minde what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
of God had before spoken.</p>
            <p>And lest that his doctrine, and
this promise of God made vnto
them by his mouth, shoulde haue
bene forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> (as we are euer prone
and ready to forget Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
when we are pressed with anye
sorrow) God raysed vp vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8586:40"/>
the midst of calamitie his Prophet
Ezechiell, vnto whome among
manye other visions he gaue this.
The hande of the Lorde first ledde
him in a place which was ful of dry
and dispersed bones.<note place="margin">Ezech. 37.</note> The question
was demaunded of the Prophet, if
these bones being wonderous dry
shuld lyue. The Prophet answered<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>
the knowledge thereof appertained
vnto God. Charge was giuen vnto
him that he shoulde speake vnto
the dry bones, and saye, thus sayth
the Lorde God to these bones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
I shall giue you breath, and
ye shall liue: I shall giue vnto you
sinewes, fleshe, and skinne, and ye
shall liue. And while the Prophete
spake (as he was commaunded) he
heard a voyce, and he sawe euery
bone ioyne in his marowe. He saw
them couered with flesh and skin,
albeit there was no spirit of lyfe in
them, he was commaunded againe
<pb facs="tcp:8586:41"/>
to speake and to say, thus sayth the
Lorde God, come O spirite from
the foure quarters, &amp; blow in these
that are slayne that they may lyue.
And as he prophecied, the spirit of
lyfe came. They liued and stoode
vpon their feete. Nowe doth the
Lorde interprete what this vision
ment, saying, Sonne of man these
bones are the whole house of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell.
Behold they say our bones are
dryed, our hope is perished, we are
playnely cut of, but beholde sayth
the Lord, I will open your graues,
I will bring you forth of them, ye
shall liue and come vnto the lande
of Israell, and ye shall knowe that
I am the Lorde.</p>
            <p>This vision I say, giuen to the
Prophete, and by the Prophete
preached to the people when they
thought that God had vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goten
them, compelled them more
diligently to aduert, what the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8586:41"/>
Prophetes had spoken. It is
no doubt, but they caryed with
them both the prophecie of Isaiah
and Ieremie, so that the Prophete
Ezechiel is a commentarie to these
wordes of Isaiah, where he sayth,
thy dead O Lorde shall liue, with
my body they shall arise. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
bringeth in this similitude of
the deawe, to aunswere vnto that
part of their fidelitie, who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue
no further of Gods promises,
than they are able to apprehende
by naturall iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t. As he wold
say, think ye this impossible, that
God shall giue lyfe vnto you and
bring you to an estate of a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
wealth agayne, after that ye be
dead, and as it were rased from the
face of the earth. But why doe ye
not consider what God worketh
from yeare to yeare in the order of
nature, sometimes ye see the face
of the earth decked and beautified
<pb facs="tcp:8586:42"/>
with herbes, floures, grasse, and
fruites. Againe ye see the same vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlye
taken awaye by stormes and
vehemencie of the winter. What
doth God to replenishe the earth
againe, and to restore the beauty
thereof. He sendeth downe his
small and soft dewe, the droppes
whereof in their descending, are
neyther great nor visible, and yet
thereby are the pores and secrete
vaynes of the earth, which before
by vehemencie of frost and colde
were shut vp, opened againe. And
so doth the earth produce againe
the like herbes, floures, and fruits.
Shal ye then thinke? that the dew
of Gods heauenly grace shall not
be as effectuall in you to whome he
hath made his promise, as that it is
in the herbes and fruites that from
yeare to yeare buddeth forth and
decayeth? if ye doe so the Prophet
would say your incredibility is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8586:42"/>
bicause ye doe neyther
rightlye waighe the power nor the
promise of your God.</p>
            <p>The like similitude vseth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
Paule against such as called
the resurrection in doubt, bicause
that by naturall iudgement they
coulde not apprehende that fleshe
once putryfied and resolued, as it
were in other substance shoulde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
againe and retourne againe
to the same substance &amp; nature.<note place="margin">1. Corin. 16.</note> O
fole (saith he) that which thou sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
is not quickened, except it dy, &amp;
that which thou sowest, thou sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
not that body that shall be, but
bare corne, as it falleth, of wheate
or some other, but God giueth it
a body as it pleaseth him, euen to
euerye seede his owne bodye. In
which wordes and sentence, the
Apostle sharpelye rebuketh the
grosse ignorance of the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who began to call in doubt the
<pb facs="tcp:8586:43"/>
chiefe article of our faith, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the fleshe after that it
was once resolued, bicause that
naturall iudgement (as saide is) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed
thereto. He reproueth (I
say) their grosse ignoraunce, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that they might haue seene
and considered some proufe and
document thereof in the very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of nature. For albeit the wheat
or other corne cast in the earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
to die, to putrifie, and so
to be lost, yet we see that it is not
perished, but that it fructifieth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Goddes will and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce.</p>
            <p>Now if the power of God be so
manifest in raysing vp of the fruits
of the earth, vnto the which no
particuler promise is made by god,
what shal be his power and vertue
in raysing vp of our bodyes, seeing
that thereto he is bound by the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lempne
promise of Iesus Christ his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8586:43"/>
eternall wisdome, and the veritie
it selfe that can not lye, yea, seeing
that the members must once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with the glorye of the

seeing that our head Iesus Christ is
now exalted in his glory. Noyther
yet is this power land good will of
God to be restrayned vnto the last
and generall resurrection onely,
but we ought to consider it in the
maruellous preseruation of his
church, and in the raysing vp of
the same from the very bottome of
death, when by titauntes it hath
bene oppressed from age to age.</p>
            <p>Nowe of the former wordes of
the Prophet we haue to gather this
comforte, that if at anye tyme we
shal see the face of the church with
in this realmeso defaced (as I think
it shall be soner than we looke for)
<pb facs="tcp:8586:44"/>
when we shall see, I say, vertue to
be dispised, vice to be mayntay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the veritie of God to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned,
lyes and mens inuentions,
holden in aucthoritie, and finally
when we shall see the true religion
of our God, and zelous obseruers
of the same, to be troden vnder the
feete of suche as in their heart saye
there is no God:<note place="margin">Psal.14.</note> Let vs then call to
minde what haue bene the wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
workes of our God from the
beginning, that it is his proper of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to bring forth lighte out of
darkenesse, order out of confusion,
lyfe out of death, &amp; finally that it
is he, that calleth thigs that are not,
euen as if they were, as before we
haue hard. And if in the day of our
te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ptation (which in my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t
approcheth fast) we be thus armed.
If our incredibilitie can not vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be remoued, yet shal it so be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
that dampnable desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8586:44"/>
oppresse vs not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But nowe let vs heare howe the
Prophete proceedeth,</hi> Come <hi>(sayth
he,)</hi> thou my people enter within thy cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
shut thy dore after thee, hide thy selfe a
very little while vntil the indingnation passe
ouer.</p>
            <p>Here the Prophet bringeth in God
amiably calling vpon his people to
come to himselfe, and to rest with
him vnto suche time as the furie &amp;
sharpe plagues should be executed
vpon the wicked and inobedient.
It maye appeare at the first sight,
that all these words of the Prophet
in the person of God calling the
people vnto rest, are spoken in
vaine. For we neyther finde cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
nor rest more prepared for the
dearest children of God (so farre as
mans iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t can discerne) than
there was for the rebellious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient.
For such as fel not in the
edge of the sworde, or dyed not of
<pb facs="tcp:8586:45"/>
pestilence, or by hunger, were ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
caryed captiues into Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
or else departed after into Egipt,
so that none of Abrahams feede,
had eyther chamber or quiet place
to remayne within the lande of
Canaan. For the resolution hereof
we must vnderstand that albert the
chambers whereunto God called
his chosen, be not visible. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
they are certaine, &amp;
offer vnto Gods children quiet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
in spirite, howsoeuer the
flesh be trauayled and tormented.</p>
            <p>The chambers are then Goddes
sure promises, vnto the which gods
people is commaunded to resorte,
yea within the which they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inaunded
to close them selues in
the time of greatest aduersitie. The
maner of speaking is borowed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
that iudgement &amp; foresight, which
God hath printed in this our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For whe! that men espie great
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8586:45"/>
tempestes appearing to come, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
they will not remayne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the fields, but straight
way, they will drawe them to their
houses or holdes, that they maye
escape the vehemency of the same.
And if they feare any enimy to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
them, they wil shut their dores,
to the ende that sodainely the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
shall not haue entry. After
this same maner God speaketh to
his people, as he shoulde saye, the
tempest that shall come vpon this
whole nation shall be so terrible,
that nothing shall appeare but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
to come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the whole
bodye. But thou my people, thou
I saye, that hearest my worde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuest
the same, and tremblest at
the threatenings of my Prophetes,
now when the world doth insole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resist, let such I say, enter within
the secrete chamber of my promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Let them conteyne themselues
<pb facs="tcp:8586:46"/>
quietly there, yea let them shut the
dore vpon them, and suffer not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie,
the mortall enimie of my
truth and of my people that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
therupon, to haue free entrie
to trouble (yea rather to murther)
my promise. And so shall they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
that my indignation shall
passe, and that such as depend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
me, shall be saued.</p>
            <p>Thus we may perceyue the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Prophete. Whereof we
haue first to obserue, that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
them for his people,
that are in greatest affliction, yea
such as are reputed vnworthy of
mens presence, are yet admitted
with the secrete chamber of God.
Let no man thinke that fleshe and
bloude can sodaynely attayne to
that comfort, &amp; therfore most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t
it is, that we be frequentlye
exercised in meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of thesame.
Easie it is I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t in time of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8586:46"/>
to saye and to thinke, that
God is our God, and that we are
his people. But when he hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
vs ouer in the handes of oure eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and tourned (as it were) his
back vnto vs, then I say, stil to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme him to be our God, and to
haue this assurance that we are his
people, procedeth wholly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the
holy spirite of God,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 5.</note> as is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
victorie of faith, which ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
the worlde, for increase
whereof we ought continuallye to
pray.</p>
            <p>This doctrine we shall not think
straunge, if we shal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sider how so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely
our spirites are caryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from our God, and from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuing
his promise, so sone as anye
great temptation doth apprehend
vs, then begin we to doubt if euer
we beleued Gods promises, if God
will fullfill them to vs, if we abide
in his fauour, if he regardeth and
<pb facs="tcp:8586:47"/>
loketh vpon the violence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie
that is done vnto vs, and a
multitude of suche cogitations,
which before lurked quietlye in
our corrupted heartes, burst vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
forth when we are oppressed
with any desperate calamitie. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the which, this is the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
once to apprehend and still to
retayne, God to be our God, and
firmelye to beleue, that we are his
people whome he loueth, and will
defende, not onely in affliction,
but euen in the middest of death it
selfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly let vs obserue, that the
iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts of our God neuer were,
nor yet shall be so vehement vpon
the face of the earth, but that there
hath bene and shall be some secrete
habitation prepared in the sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
of God for some of his chosen,
where they shall be preserued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the indignation passe by, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8586:47"/>
that God prepareth a tyme, that
they maye glorifie him againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the face of the worlde, that
sometimes despised them: and this
ought to be vnto vs no small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in these appearing daungers,
to wit, that we be surely persuaded
that howe vehement that euer the
te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pest shal be, that it yet shall passe
ouer, and some of vs shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
to glorifie the name of oure
God as is aforesaide.</p>
            <p>Two vices lurke in this our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the one is, that we can not
tremble at Gods threatninges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the plagues apprehende
vs, albeit that we see cause moste
iust why that his fierce wrath shuld
burne as a deuouring fire. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, that when calamities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pronounced fal vpon vs, then
begin we to sincke downe in des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
so that we neuer loke for
any comfortable end of the same.
<pb facs="tcp:8586:48"/>
To correct this our mortall infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
in time of quietnesse, we
ought to consider what is the ius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of our God, and howe odious
sinne is. And aboue all other, how
odyous Idolatry is in his presence
who hath forbidden it, and who
hath so seuerelye punished it in all
ages from the beginning. And in
the tyme of our afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> we ought
to consider, what haue beene the
wonderous workes of our God in
preseruation of his churche, when
it hath bene in vttermost extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
For neuer shall we finde the
church humbled vnder the hands
of tirantes and cruellye tormented
by them, but therewith we shall
finde Goddes iuste vengeance to
fall vpon the cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ell persecuters,
and his merciful deliuerance to be
shewed to the afflicted<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> And in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of this tryall, we shoulde not
onely cal to minde the histories of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8586:48"/>
auncient times, but also we should
diligentlye marke what notable
workes God hath wrought euen in
this our age, aswell vpon the one,
as vpon the other. We ought not
to thinke that oure God beareth
lesse loue to his church this daye,
than that he hath done from the
beginning. For as our God in his
owne nature is immutable, so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth

there was of any deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

            <p>The Prophet bringeth forth the
eternall God, as it were from his
owne place and habitation, and
therewith sheweth the cause of his
comming to be, that he may take
acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pt of al such as haue wrought

as delight in shedding of bloude
should be persuaded that this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

sayde that the Lorde will come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
his place, and that he wil visite the
iniquitie of the inhabitants of the
earth vppon them, and that the
earth shall disclose her bloude.</p>
            <p>We haue to consider what moste
commonly hath beene, and what
shal be the condition of the church
of God, to wit, that it is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
hated, mocked, and dispised,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8586:51"/>
but that it is exposed, as it were in
a pray, vnto the furie of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
so that the bloud of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God,<note place="margin">Psal.</note> is spilt like water vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the face of the earth. The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
whereof, albeit it be
vnpleasaunt to the flesh. Yet to vs
it is most profitable, least that we,
seing the cruel entreatings of Gods
seruauntes, beginne to misknowe
the spouse of Iesus Christ, bicause
that she is not intreated in this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull
worlde, as that the iust
and vpright dealing of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
doth deserue. But contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
for mercy, they receyue cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie,
for doing good to manye, of
al the reprobate they receyue euil.
And this is decreed in Gods eternal
councell, that the members maye
follow the trace of the head, to the
ende, that God in his iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
should finally condempne
the wicked. For howe shoulde he

How should the earth disclose our
bloude, if it should not be vniust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spilt? We must then commit our
selues into the handes of our God,
and laye downe our neckes, yea &amp;
pacientlye suffer our bloude to be
shed, that the righteous iudge may
require accompt, as most assuredly
he shall of all the bloude that hath
bene shed, from the bloud of Abell
the iust, till the day that the earth
shall disclose the same.<note place="margin">A terrible, but moste true sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce.</note> I say euery
one that sheddeth or consenteth to
shed the bloude of Gods children,
shal be giltie of the whole. So that
all the bloude of Goddes children
shall crye vengeance, not onely in
general, but also in particuler, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
euerye one, that hath shed the
bloude of anye that vniustly suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>And if any thinke it strange that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8586:52"/>
such as liue this daye, can be giltie
of the bloude that was shed in the
dayes of the Apostles. Let them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that the veritie it selfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
that all the bloude that
was shedde from the dayes of Abel
vnto the dayes of Zacharie should
come vpon that vnthankefull ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
that heard his doctrine,
and refused it. The reason is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
for as there is two heads and
and captaines that rule vpon the
whole worlde, to wit, Iesus Christ,
the Prince of iustice and peace, &amp;
Sathan, called the Prince of the
worlde, so are they but two armies,
that hath continued battaile from
the beginning, and shall fight vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ende. The quarell is one
which the armie of Iesus Christ
susteine, which the reprobate doe
persecute, to wit, the eternal truth
of the eternall God, and the image
of Iesus Christ, printed in his elect,
<pb facs="tcp:8586:53"/>
so that whosoeuer in any age per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuteth
any one member of Iesus
Christ for his truth sake, subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
as it were with his hande, the
persecution of all that haue passed
before him. And this ought the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes
of this age deepely to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
for they shal be giltye not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the bloud shed by themselues,
but of al (as saide is) that hath bene
shed for the cause of Iesus Christ
from the beginning of the worlde.</p>
            <p>Let the faithfull not be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
although they be appointed
as shepe to the slaughter house, for
he, for whose sake they suffer, shal
not forget to reuenge their cause.
I am not ignoraunt that fleshe and
bloude will thinke that kinde of
suporte, too too late. For we had
rather be preserued stil aliue, than
to haue our bloud to be reuenged
after our death. And truely if our
felicitie stoode in this lyfe, or if
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8586:53"/>
death temporall should bring vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs anye damage, our desire in
that behalfe were not to be damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But seeing that death is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to al, and that this temporall
lyfe, is nothing but miserie, &amp; that
death doth fully ioyne vs with our
God, and giueth vnto vs the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of our inheritaunce, why
shuld we think it straunge to leaue
this worlde and goe to our head &amp;
soueraigne captayne Iesus Christ?</p>
            <p>Now last we haue to obserue this
maner of speaking, where that the
Prophet sayth. The earth shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close
her bloud. In which wordes,
the Prophet would accuse the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie
of those that dare so vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ryue from the breastes of the
earth, the dearest children of God,
and cruelly cut their throts in her
bosome, who is by God appointed
the common mother of mankinde,
so that she vnwillingly is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:8586:54"/>
led to open her mouth, &amp; receyue
their bloud.</p>
            <p>If such tirannie were vsed against
any naturall woman, as violently
to pull her infant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> her breastes,
cut the throte of it in her own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
and compell here to receyue
the bloude of her deare childe in
her owne mouth, al nations would
holde the fact so abhominable,
that the like had neuer beene done
in the course of nature. And no
lesse wickednesse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mit they that
shedde the bloud of Gods children
vpon the face (as I haue saide) of
their common mother the earth.
But be of good courage (O little &amp;
dispised flocke of Christ Iesus) for
he that seeth your griefe hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to reuenge it. He that will not

the Godly feare in case this reason

tirannie vnder collour of lawe, wil
take from vs our tithes, and so can

Yea alas, howe many of vs are not
maintayners of those theues, and
partakers of their murders, called
Bishops, Abbottes, and Pryors. Let
no man wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>der that we terme such

them rather wonder, that God
poureth not forth the vttermost of
his vengeaunce vpon the realme,

for they take large fee and serues

that by withholding the bread of

            <p>The tenthes were once appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
