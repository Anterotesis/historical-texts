            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Acknowledge, that I am no less unworthy to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before you, than I was before your Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, having in me the same duty and reverence for your high Bloud, and the same equal regard for your Person: Yet I come with confidence to you; for having found so affable and sweet a Reception from your dear Brother, I ought not at all to doubt of yours: since his Great Bloud runs in your veins, you must also retain his Vertues; and in you they are justly called so, yet they are not so in all men; for if slaves, and servants, and meaner men, prove affable and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it is not Vertue in them, because it is their duty: but in you, being adorned with all your Greatness, it shews so rich a Goodness in you, that all men are oblig'd to return you honour for it, which I do with my heart, and all my faculties. I also present you, Sir,
<pb facs="tcp:99508:3"/>
with a poor French-man, Monsieur <hi>Raggou,</hi> being party perpale Trooper, and Cook: I tender him to you in his own Equipage just as he landed, with not so much as a shirt to his back: But that is no new thing to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Nation; therefore, Sir, receive him as an object to exercise your Charity upon; being naked cloath him; let him but wear your Livery, and he will not only be received, but be made welcome to all men: Lay your protecting hand upon him, and he is safe from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his Enemies: And, Sir, as I am bound, so I pray, that you may want no one Vertue that may make you up a Miracle: May your Great Bloud appoint you to cut your own fortune out, and may you do it with such success and valour, that all men of courage may honour you, and the rest of the World fear you.</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE To the READER.</head>
            <p>EPistles ('tis true) are customary, but I think as unnecessary as Funeral Sermons, for they must either insinuate and flatter grosly, or else say nothing to the purpose: For my part I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, Reader, what to say to thee, unless like a raw Preacher I swerve from my Text; and instead of a modest Apology for my bold printings, tell thee a Tale of <hi>Maestricht</hi> being taken, or the Dutch bang'd at Sea; and to do that were to rob the <hi>Gazette,</hi> and so be call'd in question for Intrenchments. What then shall I say? shall I praise my Play to thee? No, that were to be a vain glorious Ass; and in thy power, Reader, to prove me so: What then, shall I decry it? No, that were to break the Stationer, that perhaps has paid too dear for it: What then, shall I discover the Plot and Intrigue of the Play to thee? No, to speak of the Plot in the Epistle, were to fore-stall
<pb facs="tcp:99508:4"/>
the reading of the Play, and so dam the sail of it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead then of an ingenious Epistle to divert, I beg a crafty Boon, Reader, that some one eminent leading Voice amongst you, will be for once so kind, as to give an excellent Character to the World of this my Play; and by that decoy people may be drawn in to buy it off: so that, as I have cozen'd the Stationer, by this means the Stationer may over-reach you; and in so doing, Reader, you will</p>

                  <p>Because he is an Hypocrite, a yea and nay knave; he cannot endure to plunder, but (in a godly manner) he will take all he can lay his hands on.</p>

                  <speaker>Tell.</speaker>
                  <p>No; I'l fight for him as all men fight for Kings, partly for love, partly for my own ends. I'l fight bravely for a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel or two; then beg an old house to make a Garrison of, grow rich, consequently a coward, and then let the Dog bite the Bear, or the Bear the Dog, I'l make my own peace, I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you; and, in short, this is my business hither.</p>

                  <p>Lieutenant, get your Corporals together, and give 'em Orders to make ready for a march; and be sure you charge 'em to see every Horse in their Squadrons shod, otherwise we shall have 'em lye behind drinking and plundring, and then pretend they stay to shooe their Horses: let me hear no more on't.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>

                  <p>But are you wise too? for else the want of wit to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage your honesty, may make you a knave. I know 'tis some mens cases.</p>

               </sp>

                  <speaker>Tell.</speaker>
                  <p>I have so; but I must ask you another question ere you know it. Are you stanch enough to keep a secret? Be not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry; many of your party cannot hold: for tell you news, and you fly, like lightning, to the next man to disgorge it, and so it goes round till it comes to the Enemy; and thus you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray your business, and intend it not neither.</p>

                  <speaker>Tell.</speaker>
                  <p>You shall. And to shew you that I have business, I know what your Orders are.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, 'tis impossible.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tell.</speaker>
                  <p>Nothing impossible: you are to remove your Troop to <hi>Cilstow,</hi> there quarter till further Orders, but not to go to bed, for you are within three miles of a little house call'd <hi>Thieves-den</hi> Garrison, and you are to expect a company of Foot to quarter with you: is this your Orders?</p>

                  <speaker>Tell.</speaker>
                  <p>I am a plain, honest-meaning man, a neighbour to that Garrison of <hi>Thieves-den,</hi> and one that has div'd into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of both your parties, and find that you have faults, but the other great wickedness.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>What if you went to <hi>Oxford</hi> with me?</p>

If I should have for every man that has been dealing here a child, and if the children should be born with every one a Back and Brest on, as they were got? Bless me, what hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour should I have! But, for all this, I hope I do not go with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Squadron of children. But to my business. I mean to lay this great belly to every man that has but touch'd my Apron-strings.

                  <p>No, Sir, I have more wit; my drift is to lay it to more than one man, or one Squadron: Sir, I understand there's a months pay in your hands; and I am resolv'd to lay this great belly to every man round the Troop; some I have struck already, and they have very fairly compounded with me; some, I suppose, may bustle and stand out, but if you will countenance me, then they must compound at our rates.</p>

                  <speaker>Bid.</speaker>
                  <p>That is, if the man love the woman; but that's not my case: for 'tis she loves me, not I her.</p>

                  <p>No disturbance, sweet Sir. (I want sine words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press my love in.) I am sorry that the Cart-wheel of Fortune should drive me into the Coach-box of your affection.</p>

                  <speaker>Bid.</speaker>
                  <p>Fortune will take it scurvily to call her wheel a Cart-wheel: besides, Coach-box and Cart-wheel did never agree in this world yet.</p>

                  <p>Read that: upon my life there is but three Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and two of 'em are disarm'd, and Prisoners, Officers and all. I laid no plot to do it, I found 'em all ready to betray one another to get the wealth; the manner how, hereafter. The Governour has commission'd me to make his Conditions; which must be a Convoy, with all his wealth, to his own home. The Country bring in their plate and goods to secure 'em from your party, and he'l make conditions with you to march away with 'em, and so cheat the people: (precious Rogues!) besides what they preach the women out of.</p>

                  <p>That must not be; for the King has Intelligence that they have great Treasure there.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, very well; with the cheat of preaching (I mean Tub-preaching, and Lectures.) The Lectures your wives read you, never aw'd you so.</p>

                  <p>What, for breaking Articles with a Rebel? Had it been a fair enemy, I grant you. Suppose you storm it, and be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten off? the King would give you little thanks for the punctil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio of your own private honour. Let your Lieutenant do it: the Captain may with his Honour break the Conditions that his Lieutenant makes.</p>

                  <p>You have done well: where's my man? give 'em half a piece; you have done prettily indeed. Lieutenant, cashier the Flint-fleyers: as for these Hypocrites I'l keep them prisoners till the King dispose of 'em, which will be but too mercifully I'm sure.</p>

            <l>PRologues, and Epilogues, should something say</l>
            <l>In order to th' excusing of a Play;</l>
            <l>But things toth' purpose, being laid aside,</l>
            <l>We shoot at random at least six bows wide;</l>
            <l>Speaking of this or that, of Sea or Land,</l>
            <l>Of any Matter but the thing in hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>If men with such faults, Poets do Commence,</l>
            <l>I may put in with my impertinence.</l>
            <l>And though my dull Muse cannot make y'a feast,</l>
            <l>I'd fain be thought a Poet at the least:</l>
            <l>I find I am one, I can prove it plain,</l>
            <l>Both by my empty Purse, and shallow Brain:</l>
            <l>I've other symptoms to confirm it too,</l>
            <l>I've great, and self conceit, of all I do:</l>
            <l>I have my little Cullies too i'th' Town,</l>
            <l>Both to admire my works, and lend a Crown.</l>
            <l>My Poets day I morgage to some Citt,</l>
            <l>At least six months before my Play is writ;</l>
            <l>And on that day away your Poet runs,</l>
            <l>Knowing full well, in sholes, come all his duns.</l>
            <l>If these things make me not a perfect Poet,</l>
            <l>He that has better Title let him shew it.</l>
