         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>June,</hi> 1649. As we ſhall ſee neceſſary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductng

We have thought fit to give the following
Rules to His Majeſties Commiſſioners
appointed for ſetling the undiſpoſed part of the
ſaid ſecurity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That in caſe the Poſſeſſor deſires to Compound for the Fee of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

than by his own diſcovery) that the Kings is Intituled to the
ſame, that the Poſſeſſor be Admitted to have His Majeſties Title, and
be Diſcharged of the mean Profits, paying one third part of the value
of the ſaid Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, the ſame to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Inheritance of Lands at ten Years Purchaſe of clear
Yearly value, over and above the Quite, Rent, and of Houſes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hereditaments, at eight Years purchaſe at the like clear yearly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That where there is an Incombrance, and the Poſſeſſor deſires
the Preemption, and being his own diſcovery, there the inheritance
of Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments to be valued as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
and the Incumbrance being deducted, the Poſſeſſor to pay, <hi>viz.</hi> if an
Incumbrance of money by Mortgage or otherwiſe upon Lands or Houſes,
one third of the Remain of the value, and if an Incumbrance by Leaſe
for Term of years, the Leaſe to be indifferently valued, and to pay one
third of that value after deduction of the Ineumbrance as aforeſaid; And
if the Incumbrance be from a Nocent, to an Innocent, in which caſe the
Money is onely forfeited, a third part of the Money.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That where the poſſeſſor deſires to Compound for the Fee of
any Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, and by the help of a diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the Litle already appears, in ſuch caſe the Diſcoverer vsing firſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
by the Poſſeſſor, according to former Rules, the Poſſeſſor to pay
one moyety of the Remain according to the values aforeſaid, yet no Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor

next after notice or warning given him by the ſaid Commiſſioners, appear
before them and accept thereof, without further ſuit or trouble.</p>

1660. and himſelf making diſcovery, to Pay Ten years Purchaſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the value of the ground as the ſame ſhall appear to be worth
before the ſaid Improvements, and where there was any former building,
upon the ground which has been ſince pulled down, and New built or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
the ſaid Poſſeſſor to pay eight years purchaſe, according to the value
of the ſaid former building,</p>
            <p>And we do hereby laſtly order and Declare, that in all Certificates
hereafter to be paſſed by the aforeſaid Commiſſioners of any Mortgaged

ſuch proportion as the whole value of the ſaid Reſpective Houſes or
Lands at the rate of Ten years Purchaſe, ſhall appear to them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

ſhall be Reſerved to His Majeſtie out of ſuch Houſes or
Lands, And ſo in like manner and proportion where the value of ſuch
Houſes or Lands ſhall appear in a greater or leſs Proportion to exceed
ſuch unforfeited Incumbrances thereupon, Yet ſo as the Rents that
ſhall be ſo reſerved, be not in any caſe leſs than one Fifth Part of the nex<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Quitrents payable to His Majeſtie out of ſuch Lands by the ſaid
Arts, and that the ſaid Rents ſo to be reſerved, be alſo in all caſes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than the Rent payable to his Majeſtie out of ſuch Lands
in the year 1641. And that upon paſſing ſuch Certificate, the Rents
therein to be reſerved be made payable to his Majeſtie from the Date
of ſuch Certificate, And whereas the preſent Farmers of his Majeſties
Revenue, have declared their willingneſs and readineſs to conſent and
agree to the moderation &amp; abatement of Quitrents according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
aforeſaid, in all caſes where the preſent Proprietor or Poſſeſſor of

the forty nine Officers, ſhall be willing to compound and agree for the

further order, that in all ſuch caſes the ſaid Commiſſioners do acquaint
the ſaid Farmers of his Majeſties Revenue of ſuch perſons as they ſhall
