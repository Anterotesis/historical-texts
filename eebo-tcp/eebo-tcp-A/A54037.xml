            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of that filthiness which every
man thinks he is free from, and yet the heart of
every man is ful of. Who is there that looks not
on the more hideous part of Evil, at least, as at
a distance from himself? Little does man
think, while he cries out against it, and seems
very zealous to have it purged out of the whol
world (if it were possible) that it lodgeth so
close in his own bosome, that he doth not, nay
cannot discern it there. <hi>I the Lord search the
heart, and try the reins,</hi> but no man knows
what is in his heart, or in his reins.</p>
            <p>Abundance of wickedness hath broken
forth in these few years, and every eye sees
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94551:3"/>
it in the spreading, in the budding forth of it,
but who sees it in the root? It appears in the
Kings party, in the Parliaments party, in the
Armies party; among the Episcopal sort,
Presbyterians, Independents, &amp;c. All these
see it plainly enough in one another, and
strengthen themselves in accusations against
one another; but who suspects it at home?
Who imagines, while he cries out against
Pride, Covetousness, Cruelty, Treason, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
Blasphemy, &amp;c. that he himself is the
spring whence these issue, and where they
would live and flourish, if all the outward
appearances of them were cut off?</p>
            <p>What <hi>Moses</hi> once said to the people of <hi>Israel</hi>
neer the time of his death, That they had seen
great works &amp; wonders of God, both in Egypt
and in the Wilderness, yet God had not given
them an heart to perceive, nor eyes to see, nor
ears to hear, unto that very day, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 3, 4.
The same may be applied to me, and every
man, in the sence in hand. We have seen great
and strange breakings forth of wickedness;
Man hath been stripped almost naked, turned
inside out; this have we all seen, but we have
not seen our selves in this sight; our own
nakedness is not understood by us: It is the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94551:3"/>
Kings party that is so unjust, so prophane, so
tyrannical, so cruel, so self-ish, not the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments:
'tis the Parliaments party, not the
Armies: 'tis the Armies, not the Levellers:
So in Religion, 'Tis the Episcopal party that
is so loose, so formal, so oppressive in matters
of Religion, not the Presbyterians: 'Tis the
Presbyterians, not the Independents; or if
some of all these, yet not I, not such as are
of my stamp, of my practise. Ah subtle,
whorish Self! who can finde thee in thy cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shifts, who canst lodg wickednes so secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in thy heart, that thou thy self knowest it
not to be there? Well, shall I tell thee what
I think? Surely Condemnation is written in
every mans forehead: Every man, in finding
fault with others, pronounceth judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
himself dayly. When thy heart shall
be opened by the Searcher of it, and the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence
of that discovered to be in thee,
whereof thou hast condemned but some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
in others, what wilt thou be able to
plead why that judgment should not pass
upon thee, that thou hast passed upon others.
Doubtless thou must be forced to confess, that
how unrighteous soever thy Judgment hath
been concerning others, (as most of our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94551:4"/>
passed upon others are, though we think
otherwise,) yet the Judgment of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
thee, is just: And it is a righteous
thing, that thou thy self shouldst undergo that
sentence, which thou thy self hast pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
against others, in a case far short of thine,
especially seeing thy Saviour (who can be thy
onely hope of reserve) bids thee expect it; for
he positively told his Disciples, That with
what Judgment they did judg they should be
judged, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 2. Thou hast here presented
to thee a little taste of a parcel of thy Self, how
thou wilt rellish it, I know not: Thou mayst
think thy self injured because it is layd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
close to thee, without such limitations
and exceptions as thou mightest have crept
out at. Well, be it so, but know withall, that
when thou comest to be searched by the
Candle of the Lord, thou must be forced to
own these yet farther, and perhaps far more
deeper, and greater abominations then these.
However take this as kindly as thou canst
from him, who waits, in some measure, as he
is enabled, for the destruction of this whorish
Self, both in himself and in thee. Who then
shall become entirely Thine.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
wicked, who can know it?</p>
                  <p>I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere are four Eminent things affirmed
concerning the Heart of Man.</p>
            <p>1. The extream deceitfulness of it,
<hi>The heart is deceitfull above all things.</hi>
There are abundance of deceits in the
World, deceits in every Art, in every Trade, in
every Motion, in every Appearance, in all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Sense, Reason, Religion; but nothing like the
heart of man for subtilty, for secrecy, for depth of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94551:5"/>
deceit. There is deceitfulness, almost in all things,
that presently cozens a superficial eye. All things are
painted, and he that looks but upon the paint in things,
and imagines, because he can see and acknowledg the
paint, that he sees and knows the thing, is deceived in
all things. But in some things there is a thicker paint,
they are more throughly guilt, they are so curiously
wrought, so like the thing they represent, that it will
require a very narrow piercing eye to look through
them into the substance it self. Some things have yet
a deeper dye, that 'tis almost impossible to discern
them. There are such cheats and cheaters abroad in
the world in all sorts of things, in all sorts of objects;
in the objects of sense, in the objects of reason, in the
objects of Religion, that it is almost if not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
impossible for any man to escape delusion, who
meets with an accurate cheat, in the hand of an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
cheater.</p>
            <p>But all these are nothing to the heart of a man, the
heart of a man far surpasses all these, <hi>It is deceitfull
above all things,</hi> it hath far more curious deceits, and
it is far more exact at the Art of deceiving then any
thing else can be. It has deceits and skill to cozen it
self with: It can seem to hate sin, and make it self
beleeve it doth hate sin; all manner of sin, its
own beloved sin, its inmost sins most, and yet
all this while hugg, cherish, imbrace, enjoy
them; unseen, unknown to it self: it can kisse sin and
suck the sweetness of sin, even in those very prayers
it seems to put up against sin, and of that very sin
which it seems in its own spirit to be most fearfull of,
and most bent against. It can feed sin with that stroke
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94551:5"/>
which it seems to give to it, to mortifie and stab it. It
can seem to be zealous for God, for the advancement
of his glory, for the good of man in generall, and
more particularly for the people of God, big with
motions and designes this way, and in the mean time
hate God his glory, yea, hate man and the people of
God, and in those very designes and motions, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the throwing of them all down; and all this so
unknown to it self, that it would think, you did it the
greatest injurie in the world to conceive so of it; nay,
it should be injurious to it self, if it should suspect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such thing concerning it self. Here is a deceiver in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
other deceivers cosen others, and they are very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
in deceit that can cosen all others, but the heart
can cosen it self at any time, or in any thing it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and so cosen it self too, that it is impossible to
suspect deceit in that thing wherein it cosens it self.
The heart is indeed deceitfull above all things.</p>
            <p>2. The extream wickednesse of it, <hi>and desperatly
wicked,</hi> it is as wicked as it is deceitfull, as filthy
within, as finely painted without. It is not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that it hath this large cloak of sin, but it has
within proportionable wickednesse to cover with it.
There is a Fountaine, a Sea, an Ocean of wickedness,
and of the worst kind, the intensest kind, desperate wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness.
The sinne that appeares abroad in the world,
is but some drops, some rivolets of that that is in the
heart; nay, it is hardly of the same kind. The evill
that appeares in the World, it is modest, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall,
lovely in comparison of that which is in the
heart; that, there is a more mad, a more desperate
kind of wickednesse; that Uncleanness, that Pride,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94551:6"/>
that Cruelty, that Enmity, that Rebellion against
God, that Blasphemy that makes such a noise in the
world; Alas, it is a poore peece of wickednesse to
that which is in thine and my heart. If our hearts
were opened and compared with such outward actings
of those persons we now think very abominable, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,
they would be Saints in respect of us, the sight
of such a depth of desperate wickednesse would swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
up a little shallow breakings forth of it.</p>
            <p>3. The vniversall ignorance of man concerning his
heart; nay, the impossibility of any ones knowing it.
<hi>Who can know it?</hi> Such a question according to the
common rule of Interpretation, is a strong negation,
more forcible then if it had been barely thus expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
No man can know it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who can know it?</hi> Every man thinks he knows his
heart, charge him with any thing, how confidently
will he go to purge himselfe of it, as if he were abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
certain it were not in him. But his heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
him about the knowledge of it self, as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
other things, for he doth not, he cannot know it.
He may take a great deal of pains to search and examin
it; he may have some experience of some evill in it,
some guesses at more, but the knowledge of the evill
of it he has not.</p>
            <p>Man is not capable of knowing his own heart, it is
too bigg for him to comprehend, too vaste, too deep
for his shallow brains, to receve the knowledg of. The
light of Religion may shew him much evill in it, and
make him sensible that there is much more, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
to shew it him, all the light of Religion that
I have tasted of, or heard of, cannot attain to. At
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94551:6"/>
sometime I have had some astonishing sights of a
depth of pride, unbelief, covetousness, hypocrisie, &amp;c.
but distinctly to discern, or measure that depth, hath
still been too hard for me, when the light was clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and fullest. And here I am told, tis not my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
alone, but the condition of others also; yea of
all men, <hi>Who can know it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The worke that God is continually about in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the heart of man, <hi>I the Lord search the heart, I
try the reines.</hi> Would you know what God is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doing in the World, why he is searching the heart,
and trying the reines. No man can do it, He can, and
does. He has a bucket that he can let down into this
great deep, and bring up what kind of filth of it he
pleases, and poure it forth in the sight of the Sun.</p>
            <p>This is the work God hath alwaies been about-Look
into the Scripture, what is it, but Gods discovery of
mans heart, a record of Gods searching the heart, and
trying the reines. It is mans work to hide and cover
his heart, &amp; to lay all his loathsomness deep, and remove
it as far out of the sight of himself and others, as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
may be. It is Gods work to search out his filth,
to fetch it up out of this dark depth, and set it in order
before his and others eyes. And what a man may seem
most free from, and think himself wholly mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
unto, God chuses to draw forth and discover
to him and others. Drunkenness out of temperate
<hi>Noah,</hi> Incest out of chaste <hi>Lot,</hi> Unbeliefe out of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>Abraham,</hi> Rigid sharpnesse out of meek <hi>Moses,</hi>
Impatience and curses out of patient and blessing <hi>Job,</hi>
Pride out of newly broken and humbled <hi>Hezekiah.</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:94551:7"/>
And I have often found, that what evill I have dis-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
in others, and thought God might justly be
meeet with them for, it was soon after opened, and
let loose in mine own heart.</p>
            <p>This deserves serious consideration, for as it is the
work God is alwaies about, so he seems now more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to apply himself to it, he hath gone very far in it,
he hath so opened this sink in all sorts of men, in every
man, that every man is become abominable, I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
said, to all but himself, and his own party. <hi>I the
Lord search the heart, I try the reines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My intention at present is only to treat a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the second of these, the desperate wickedness of
of mans heart, wherein there may also be a further
touch given about the deceitfulness of it too, it being
a part of its wickedness, as well as cloak for all the
rest.</p>
            <p>The heart is desperately wicked.</p>
            <p>This is his testimony of it, who tries and knows
it. I might mention other Scriptures also which
speak to the same purpose, as that in <hi>Eccles. 9. 3. The
heart of the sons of men is full of evill, and madnesse is
in their heart while they live.</hi> He speaks not concerning
one mans heart, but generally concerning every mans,
<hi>the heart of the sons of men,</hi> and couples evill and them
altogether: Nor doth he speak restrainedly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
some kind of evill, but indefinitely taking in all
manner of evill; there is nothing that is called evill, but
is to be found in the heart of man. Neither is there
onely a spice or tang of some kind, nay of every kinde
of evill, but every mans heart is full of all manner of
evill. The heart is a very vast thing, but as vast as it is,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94551:7"/>
it is full, and that of evill, has as much evill in it, as it
can hold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And madness is in their heart while they live.</hi> Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is the greatest distemper that can befall man, it
quite unmans the man, takes away his reason, or rather
poysons it, that it becomes no way profitable to him,
but a strong engine to entangle him; and the greater
and stronger his reason is, the more is he bound in the
fetters of his distemper, and the less able to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
There are three known properties of madness,
of mad men. <hi>Misehievousness,</hi> especially to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they care not how they cut and would them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
<hi>Insensibleness,</hi> they feel not the smart of blows.
And <hi>Wilfulness,</hi> there is no perswading of them to any
thing, least of all to any thing that is good for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>This is the true picture, the resemblance of every
man; he is mad, what others appear to him to be in
a shadow, he himself is in truth, a mad man, a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of his true reason, that which is lest, is no more
profitable to him, then that is in him, whom he calls
the mad man. He hath all the properties of madness,
He is <hi>mischievous</hi> to himself, cuts, flashes, wounds his
soul unmercifully. He is <hi>insensible,</hi> insensible of the
wounds he gives himself, insensible of the afflictions
God lays upon him. He is <hi>wilful,</hi> there's no perswading
him to any thing, but what agrees with his madness;
you cannot displease him more then to offer him Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
nor torment him more then force him to take it.
And when God doth force any upon him, and cause it to
work, how doth he roar and cry out, as if the healing
of his madness were the loss of his happiness? Nor
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94551:8"/>
doth this madness lie in some of his motions, but in his
heart, where it keeps possession all the days of his life.
<hi>And madness is in their heart while they live,</hi> while man
lives, while man hath an heart of his own, this madness
lies in it when he dyes, and has a new heart given him,
that heart is free from it. So that well known place,
<hi>Mat. 15. 19. Out of the heart proceeds evil thoughts, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
What a bundle of wickedness is here that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
out of the heart, and therefore has its place and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence
in the heart.</p>
            <p>To illustrate this further, I shall instance in some of
the more common sort of Wickednesses, which lodg
in the heart, and contribute somewhat towards the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of it, as particularly in these, Pride, Covetousness,
Envy, Unrighteousness, Enmity, Cruelty, Unbelief,
Hypocrisie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> Pride: Pride is a desperate Evil, it puts every
thing out of its place, thrusts down what is excellent,
lifts up what is base and vile, sets all things in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion
and contention. What is the reason there is
so much trouble and disorder every where, but because
there is so much pride, which is still begetting, height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and nourishing them. Now the heart of man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
with this desperate Pride. Pride chiefly acts
and discovers it self in three things, in high conceits of
Self, in great desires, and vehement endeavors to exalt
and set up Self, and all these are in every man; there is
no man (though perhaps most think otherwise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
themselves) free from such conceits, from such
desires, from such endeavors.</p>
            <p>1. Every man is highly conceited of himself, of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94551:8"/>
what he is, of what he does, of what he deserves.</p>
            <p>There is none so uncomely, but they are lovely in
their own eyes; none so foolish, but they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
wise; every man admires his own parts, his own
abilities, his own gifts; every Christian, so far as he
is a man, his own graces; and he is not set high enough
thinks himself; he is qualified for higher employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in Chruch, in Common-weal, then he is put to.</p>
            <p>Then for his Actions, how highly does he think of
them also? What ever he does is well done. Seldom
does a man do anything so ill, that he does not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
himself in, in some respect or other. Is he angry? He
has just cause. Does he any wrong? He was justly provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
it was not injury, but that which the party deserved.
His good actions are exceeding good, his bad he was
drawn to, incited to, tempted to they did not flow from
himself; He hath still somewhat before him, to make
himself and his own actions lovely to him, and to take
off that unloveliness which any else may fasten upon
them.</p>
            <p>Lastly, For his desires, He values them too according
to the rate he sets upon himself, and upon his actions:
He thinks he deserves highly of men, of Christians, for
all he does for them, and among them, He is never
prized by any according to his worth, his friends do not
value him enough, Church, Common-weal, where
ever his service is, it is not sufficiently esteemed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</p>
            <p>These are the thoughts that lie hid in every mans
heart concerning himself, and at sometimes break forth
so into his view, that he must needs shut his eyes, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:94551:9"/>2. Man has great desires to set up himself; 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
if not altogether, the sole of his desires, to please
himself, to have every thing subject to himself; to be
esteemed, honored and made use of himself, to have his
abilities employed, commended, rewarded; this is the
very heart of the man, this is that every man pants af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and would fain possess.</p>
            <p>3. He uses great endeavors too to attain this; He
will run through all difficulties, use all diligence, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
all hazards and dangers to satisfie himself, to please
himself. What cost will a man be at to set up his own
will? How many contentions are dangerously begun
and chargeably maintained, meerly to humour a mans
own will? When Reason, Judgment, nay, sense of
smart says, Let them fall; No, says Will, I will rather
loose all first, and this alone many times continues
them. What pains will a man take to maintain his
own wisdom? He will rather lay his folly open by
multitudes of vain excuses, then suffer a blemish of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion
to lie upon him. How eagerly does he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the excellency of that which he commends, the
worthlesness of that which he dispraises? This is that
every man strives for, to have his will the rule, his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
the Counsellor; if any thing be amiss, he would
have had it otherwise; if anything prove amiss, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his advice was not followed. All a mans thoughts,
reasonings, discourses, beating of his brains (were he
able to see it) tend this way, either directly to advance
somewhat that hath reference to Self, or secretly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
somewhat that stands in the way of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of Self-Profit, Pleasure, Honor, either out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or inward, which draw all men after them, what
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94551:9"/>
are they, but severall waies of advancing self more su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
to its temper? This is the first of those evils
proposed to be instanced in, which hath its seat in the
heart of man, <hi>Pride.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. The second is <hi>Covetousnesse.</hi> As man onely
would set up himself, so he would onely enjoy all
himself. He would 'dwell alone; He would be as
God is, alone, and none besides him: He would have
all to himself; He is never satisfied, while there is
any thing to be had. His eye is never satisfied with
seeing, nor his eare with hearing, nor his heart with
enjoying. Every thing in man immeasurably covets,
oh what a depth then is there in his heart that feeds all
these. We look upon raking and scraping a
little silver and gold together, as the chief part of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness;
Alas! that is but one branch of it, and
but a poore petty one neither, in respect of what is
in, and if occasion serve, can arise out of his heart.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Envy.</hi> This is a desperate evill too; it did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
much hurt, <hi>His feet had almost slipped, Psal.</hi> 73.
v. 1. How? <hi>While he envied at the foolish, vers.</hi> 3. Man
envies at good that falls besides himself, at others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lift up, at the thriving of others, either in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
or spirituals. As he would be all, and have all,
so he envies both at God and men that are above
him.</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>Unrighteousness.</hi> Man is unjust in all his actions,
in all the courses he takes to lift up himself, to attain
the enjoyment of things himself. He is unrighteous
towards God and men in his dealings with them, in
his interpretations of his own, and their actions. He
judgeth favourably of himself, but severely of them.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94551:10"/>
There is no man almost that has to doe with him, acts
well towards him; he acts well towards all others.
Nay, for God himself, it is he that is too blame: He
acts well towards God, But God acts not kindly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him. He fasts, he prayes, he beleeves, he waits;
but God does not blesse him enough, either in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
or spirituals. He is forward enough in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in fasting; but God is not forward enough in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice thereof. <hi>Wherefore have we fasted? &amp;c.
The waies of the Lord are not equall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. <hi>Enmity.</hi> Man hates everything but himself. He
hates man, he hates God. <hi>The haters of God,</hi> it is a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
phrase, and it is that which is the temper of man,
it might be used for one of the most proper descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of him. Would you know what man is? why,
this he is, one that hates God, and all thoughts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
and union with him.</p>
            <p>And so he hates man too, <hi>hatefull, and hating one
another,</hi> even persons tyed together by the greatest
bonds of wickednesse (where likeness might breed
love) yet hate one another.</p>
            <p>Ah! doe not shift this from your selves to others,
but know, when yee heare of any wickedness in the
heart of any man, it is but the heart of every man
drawn out. Ther is hatred to God, and hatred to man
in us all. See it drawn out of any heart, and yee may
be sure it is in evey heart: and the reason, why men
cannot beleeve it is in them, is because there was never
occasion to draw it out forcibly and undeniably from
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But this is evidently otherwise, will some
be ready to reply. Doth not man naturally love his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94551:10"/>
kindred and friends, it is onely his enemies that he
hates.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The answer is as ready. Man onely loves
himself: and so much as is of Self in any thing, so
much he loves. The reference that is to Self in any
thing, he loves: Therefore he loves his kindred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are a part of Self, they are but Self a little
multiplied, and removed. And thus he loves God,
let him look upon him as a preserver of himself, as a
Saviour of himself, as one that is good and kind to
him: but this is not the love of God, but self-love.
In this sence a man may be said to love most things,
for most things have some reference to him, and that
reference he loves; but this is not the true love of any
thing, but the love of Self in that thing. This is not
a pure, but an adulterous love, and the flowings forth of
it in every kinde, and in every step, are unchaste.</p>
            <p>VI. <hi>Cruelty.</hi> Man is very cruell indeed, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but cruelty. Mercy is Gods; and when man
seems to shew mercy, it is Gods acting in him, though
he know it not, it is the bowels of God, streaming
forth from God through him as the pipe: But man
himself is cruell, Cruell to the creatures, a very Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
over them. Cruell to men, <hi>Homo homini lupus,</hi>
hence he is resembled to, and called in Scripture by the
name of such creatures as are most ravenous, as a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Beare, Leopard, Woolf, &amp;c.</hi> Cruell to God, he
would kill all the discoveries of God in himself, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
in heaven, in earth, and put out his very being
too, if he could. This is much shut up within man,
by him who bounds all things, and most of all the
heart of man, but let him but once let it loose, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94551:11"/>
anger and fear enough in man excite and draw it out,
then it will soon appear somewhat like it self.</p>
            <p>VII. <hi>Unbelief,</hi> distrust of God. Man, there's no
faith towards God in him; He cannot, he will not
trust God, but himself, and creatures like himself he
will trust, nay cannot, forbear trusting, how often soever
he be deceived and wounded thereby. The Jews, Gods
own people, could never be drawn to trust God, but the
helps and means themselves sought out, though they
proved continually broken reeds to them. All the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences
they had of God, all the miracles he did for
them, all the miseries they felt by declining him in their
distresses, and running to other shifts, could never bring
them to trust God, but still every fresh occasion draws
forth unbelief in them, and murmuring from them.</p>
            <p>Perhaps some beleevers may be apt to complaine,
that here wants distinction all along, and may have
such distinctions in their minds, whereby they can
throw off all this from themselves, and lay it at the
doores of unregenerate and unbeleeving mens hearts.</p>
            <p>To such I shall say onely this, Oh sirs, take heed, left
when you heart come to be ripped up, and the depths
therein laid open, they prove so vaste, as to confound
and swallow up that distinction, which now appeares
so great and clear in your eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VIII.</hi> The last evill that I now shall mention, is <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie.</hi>
The heart is very deceitfull, cozens men, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
it self, assaies to cozen God. <hi>Be not deceived, God
is not mocked.</hi> There is that in the heart of man, that
will attempt to mock and deceive God.</p>
            <p>Though all these forementioned evills are in man, yet
there is no perswading him, any one of them is in him,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94551:11"/>
at least in any such degree, as is spoken of, so deeply
doth his heart deceive him.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Pride.</hi> He is not so lift up in his spirit as was
expressed. He has not any high conceits of himself, or
of his own parts, or abilities, or graces; he sees others
go beyond him: And he has no such desires in him to
be exalted; nay, he would not be to high, nor does he
use endeavours that way, he takes no pains at all to lift
up himself, or to have himself exalted.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Covetousness:</hi> It is far from him too, he does not
rake and scrape as he sees many others do, but he is very
well contented with what he has. Is it not a strange
thing, yet very common? The most wretchedly cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
persons can see and cry out against Covetousness
in others, but they themselves seem to themselves free
of it, and all that they do in this kind is no more then
they ought, or at least are warranted to do.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Envy;</hi> He envies no man, perhaps he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
he wishes it were somewhat better with himself,
but yet he is not offended or grieved at the prosperity of
any other.</p>
            <p>So for <hi>Unrighteousness;</hi> He is far from that, he will
rather wrong himself, then any one else.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>Enmity;</hi> He bears ill will to none, forgives
all the world with all his heart.</p>
            <p>As touching <hi>Cruelty;</hi> God forbid he should be so
wicked as to be cruel to any. <hi>Is thy servant a dog?</hi> said
<hi>Hazael,</hi> when the Prophet told him weeping, what cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
he would exercise in ripping up women with child,
&amp;c. He could not harbor a thought of any such bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barism
lying within him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Unbelief</hi> likewise; which uses to discover it self, both
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94551:12"/>
in a mans spirit, withdrawing from a naked depending
on God, and in running to other things for support and
relief, is exceedingly hid in the heart from the man, so
that he cannot see or acknowledg it, unless in the lump,
(which the heart in a secret craft may do, to hide the
branches of it the more securely.)</p>
            <p>There is a notable example concerning the deceit of
the heart about the unbelief of it, in the coherence of
this Verse with the former. The Prophet had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
a curse from the Lord upon the unbeleeving
heart, Verse 5. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, Cursed is the man
that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose
heart departeth from the Lord.</hi> And had also proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the beleever blessed, <hi>Vers. 7. 8. Blessed is the man that
trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is, for he shall
be as a tree planted by the waters, &amp;c.</hi> What now would
this people say to him, who were always running to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
means, and departing from the Lord, but yet could
never be convinced thereof? Why surely they would
presently be blessing themselves; they would look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Gentiles, (who did not know God, nor trust God)
as the persons to whom this curse did belong, but as for
themselves, they were heirs of this blessing: Their
hearts could witness within them, that their trust was
not in men; indeed they did address themselves to men
sometimes for help as means under God, so they might
make use of the Egyptians or Assyrians in such a sense,
but they did not trust them, their only trust was in God.
Ah, says the Prophet, <hi>the heart is deceitful above all
things:</hi> Little do you know how your hearts cozen you;
you still think, you only use means under God, and your
trust is alone in him, whereas in truth your heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94551:12"/>
from him, you dare not, you cannot trust him in
any distress, looking it in the face, and not shrinking
back; but your heart is raised or dejected, according
as the means and helps it hath recourse to, appear unto
it.</p>
            <p>So exceeding deep is the hypocrisie of the heart, that
man can never beleeve what is in him, until he see it
break forth from him, and long may it break forth from
him before he can be drawn to see it; very palpable
must that evil be, which mans heart cannot at least in
some measure shift off from it self.</p>
            <p>Thus thou hast had a little glimmering of the grosser
part of thy self, which Self is the strange woman that
flattereth thee with her lips, alluring thee from the
chaste and pure embraces of thy first love into her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
bed: But should I track her in her more refined
footsteps and motions, in her several dresses, attires, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
paintings, &amp; shew thee her covered here with a
sweet meek disposition, with modesty, w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> learning, with
a natural nobleness of spirit, with all the excellencies of
nature, covered there with all the excellencies of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
crept into every form of holiness that is visible in
the world, into all duties, into all graces, into all spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
motions, into fasting, prayer, beleeving, waiting, love,
joy, peace, sorrow for sin, humility, patience, &amp;c. what
wouldst thou say? What wouldst thou think? How
wouldst thou stand amazed.</p>
            <p>And yet is she not now thus laid open to the sight
of every observing eye, and espied under all these by
them that watch her?</p>
            <p>She was clothed with Civility, with Morality, with
Generosity, adorned with the choicest flowers of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94551:13"/>
learning, art, in the Kings party, so finely guilded
and painted with nobleness and bravery, that her worth
seemed to be real and truly excellent: But how base
did Selfbreak forth, and appear under all these, and
put off these at pleasure? What base unworthy act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
unbeseeming men of honor or ingenuity, did Self
put those noble spirits upon?</p>
            <p>She was clothed with Religion, the Reformation
thereof, and regaining of just Rights and Liberties, and
setting up a perfect Administration of Righteousness
in the Parliaments party; a brave attire, very lovely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel:
but did not Self too apparently lie underneath it?
Did not this appear to be the dress of Self, which she
made use of, and threw off at pleasure?</p>
            <p>She was clothed with several of the highest and most
beautiful forms of Religion in the Army, with a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
zeal of setting open the fountain, and all the
channels of Righteousness, possessing every man with a
present enjoyment of those Rights and Liberties which
others had under pretence of preserving, defrauded
them of. Sure here is integrity, here is the naked Glory
of God, and good of the Nation springing up: Who
would think to find Self lie lurking close here too?</p>
            <p>Nay, it is commonly reported, that this Harlot is
crept into Churches, Ordinances, Religious Exercises;
into Fastings, Prayers, Preachings, Morning Exercises,
where Self-advancement, Self-interests, Self-ends, Self-designs
smell so strong, that they are offensive to all, but
such as are engaged in them.</p>
            <p>Blush oh Heavens, and be astonished oh Earth, how
are ye both stripped! There's no vertue nor strength
left in either of you. Natural Excellencies have now
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94551:13"/>
no power to keep Self under in the earth among men,
but there she gets up, and will be Mistress. Neither
have spiritual excellencies any power to keep her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
among Christians, but there she lifts her self up as
a Queen also. What Christ saith is to little purpose,
what Self saith is become now the Law to Christians.
If she sow the seeds of enmity and division among
them, it must grow, and the seed of Love which Christ
sows must be nipped. Though Christ say, <hi>This is my
Commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved
you;</hi> Yet if Self say, This is my Commandment, that
ye hare one another, that ye stir up hatred against one
another; that though other men would agree and be at
peace, yet ye lay about you, and keep up War and
bloodshed for your own ends and interests; while Self
is Mistress it must be so, her Law must stand.</p>
            <p>But I find my spirit growing weary of this subject,
(there is another part that I would fain be vievving of,
and digging into, and I am apt to groan out; oh that
this were shut, and that opened, or rather that this
were burnt, and consumed, and that fourbished and
brightened,) I shall therefore only propose some few
Considerations by way of Consequence from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and so conclude.</p>
            <p>The heart is desperately wicked. <hi>Then</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. See what all is, and must needs be, that flows from
the man; from such a bitter fountain what can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
but it must be bitter? If the root be so bad, all
the branches and fruit must needs be nought. All the
thoughts, words and actions of man, what are they?
surely as they come from his heart, so they cannot but
be like his heart, polluted, unclean, filthy, noisom, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94551:14"/>
to every pure eye, to every pure taste, to every
pure nostril. He that hath a pure eye, a pure pallate,
a pure nostril, cannot endure the sight, the relish, the
scent of any thing of man.</p>
            <p>And this is the Judgment that God, who knows what
they are, passes concerning them, concerning all that
flows from man, all his thoughts, all his words, all his
actions. He passes this judgment upon his thoughts,
<hi>Gen. 6. 5. And God saw that the wickedness of man was
great in the earth, and that every imagination of the
thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</hi> What ever
man thinks of, his thought is evil: If he think concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God or man, or himself; if he think to please him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
if he think to cross himself, to deny himself, to
worship God, to please God, to subject himself to the
will of God, yet if this flows from the man, it must
needs be evil, the root being so corrupt. The purity of
the object, and the seeming integrity of the action, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
take off the impurity which goes from the heart
into every motion and thought of it. There are some
kind of thoughts, malicious thoughts, cruel thoughts,
passionate thoughts, covetous thoughts, unclean
thoughts, such as these man will easily yield to be evil;
but that his holy thoughts, his religious thoughts, his
Meditations on God, his goodness, his providence, his
thoughts of Reformation, of suppressing evil in others,
and searching and purging it out of his own heart also,
that these should be evil, what man does or can suspect?
yet this sentence God passes on all his thoughts: Nay,
though he do not go so far as a thought, if he do but
imagine in any kind, the very forming of a thought in
him, the very first motion of a desire before it, and the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94551:14"/>
object can meet, this is evil; the least, the weakest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the heart has strength enough of evil in it: And
this is not only in some imagination, when his heart is
framing some notorious wicked thing, but in every
imagination, what ever thought his heart is framing;
the heart is evil, and the thought is evil, and the passage
between the heart &amp; thought is evil. And it is <hi>only evil;</hi>
it is not mixed with evil, but it is all evil, nothing but
evil; it has not only a tincture of evil going along
with it, a savour of corruption sticking to it, but it is
all corrupt. Nor is it only thus sometimes, or now and
then, but <hi>continually;</hi> all the time of man, in all the
several shapes and changes he appears in of civility,
morality, Religion, shifting out of one into another,
still it is thus with him, still of this nature are his
thoughts, his imaginations; <hi>day and night, winter and
summer, seed time and harvest,</hi> His imaginations are not
only evil in the <hi>night,</hi> in the dark time of his ignorance,
but in the <hi>day,</hi> in his brightest time, in the time of his
clearest light and knowledg; they are not only evil
in the <hi>Winter,</hi> in time of adversity, while he is under
sharp storms of afflictions, under distempers and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of the outward or inward man, but in the
<hi>Summer</hi> too, in the time of his prosperity, when he
thrives either outwardly, or in his spirit; they are not
only evil in his sad <hi>seed time,</hi> where he meets with much
trouble, temptation and interruption, but in his <hi>harvest,</hi>
when he brings in his crop of peace, joy, rest, comfort.
<hi>Continually, continually,</hi> in every state, in every conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in every change evil, and only evil is every imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the thoughts of his heart.</p>
            <p>His words are evil too, they come from the same
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94551:15"/>
root, <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks;</hi>
they are unclean, for they defile the man, <hi>that which
comes out of the man defiles the man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So also are his actions, all his actions his very best,
his praying, his hearing, his repenting, his beleeving,
&amp;c. they are unclean. <hi>Prov. 25. 27. The sacrifice of
the wicked is abomination; how much more when he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it with a wicked mind.</hi> The <hi>wicked</hi> here is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in whom this evil heart is, we look upon him as
wicked, whose life is evil in our eyes, but God looks
upon him as wicked, whose heart is evil in his eyes. The
<hi>sacrifice</hi> of this wicked person is his worshipping
God, his serving God in the way of his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
his praying, hearing, meditating, &amp;c. now this
is <hi>abomination,</hi> that which God loaths, his very soul ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors;
that which he himself would loath, if he had
but eyes to see into it. <hi>How much more when he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it with a wicked mind?</hi> It may be made more loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
by corrupt ends and desires, gathering into his
mind in the performance of it, but however it is loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som.
When he does it with never so pure an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to honor God, when he fasts and prays meerly to
abase his spirit, and lay it low before God, yet then it
is loathsom, though much more loathsom, when he does
it with a wicked mind, when he fasts and prays inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
to <hi>smite with the fist of wickedness,</hi> to set up his
own ends and designs, and beat down other parties and
interests that stand in the way of it.</p>
            <p>2. Take notice what a just ground there is, why
God should deal sharply with us, why he should chide
and fight with any of us, why he should so contend
with the man in us. Oh there is a desperate root of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94551:15"/>
wickedness in us all; Can you blame him to be at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
with it? Is it fit the holy and pure God should
let such a fountain of unholiness of impurity stand in
his sight, and not fight with it, sink it, and subdue it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himself?</p>
            <p>3. Consider what an unfitting thing it is for us to be
judging one another, who are all so deeply guilty in
that very thing wherein we judg, or can judg any other.
<hi>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art
that judgest; for wherein thou judgest another, thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnest
thy self, for thou that judgest dost the same things,</hi>
Rom. 2. 1. There is the root in thee of the same wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
action thou judgest another for, there wants only
somewhat to exhaust the corrupt juyce therof into thy
sight; but in the sight of God, who judges by the heart,
thou art as a deep in that wickedness as he, and thou by
judging his wicked action, condemnest thine own wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
heart which is full of it; Nay, thou hast done it in the
eye of God, who reckons that done which the heart
would do, and perhaps thou hast brought it forth into
act too in an higher kind, then he whom thou judgest
hath done, though thou seest it not, and so canst not be
sensible of it.</p>
            <p>What canst thou acquit  thy self of, that thou judgest
another for? Wilt thou judg another for Adultery?
Thou hast it in thine heart, and hast acted a worse adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
hast forsaken the bed of thy unblemished husband
indeed. Wilt thou judg another for murder? (I
speak not concerning judicial proceedings in Courts of
Justice, where Magistrates as they are entrusted with a
work beyond man, so they are enstated in a degree above
man, <hi>I have said, ye are gods;</hi> yet therein they fall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94551:16"/>
short too, because they are but men at bottom, and so at
best can judg but according to the sight of the eye, and
hearing of the ear, which is opposed to righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Isai.</hi> 11. 3, 4.) I say, Wilt thou judg another for
murder? Thou hast that cruelty in thee that would
commit it, yea, and hast killed the Lord of life. Wilt
thou condemn Antichrist? Thou hast the man of sin
in thee, whereof that which thou callest Antichrist is,
as it were, but a figure. Wilt thou judg another for
fleshly principles, and fleshly actings? Alas! How
many fleshly principles prevail in thee? How many
fleshly actings issue out from thee, perhaps in an higher
kind and degree of spiritual wickedness, then the party
whom thou judgest is capable of.</p>
            <p>God has still given several outward Representations
in the several ages of the world, of the wickedness of
mans inward parts, to point him thereby as with the
finger, to the sight, knowledg and detestation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
but this hath still been the subtle course of the
deceitful heart of man, to cry out aloud against evil in
those outward dresses, and the mean while to nourish
the substance of it within. And still as persons grow
in light and knowledg, and so come to discern the
more secret and spiritual dresses of it, they are ready
to give themselves scope to condemn it in such or such
a dress, (wherein now they full well know it,) not see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what more spiritual shape the same thing has put
on in them, under which it hides it self, and acts more
powerfully, then it did in those lower shapes and dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
whereby it deluded them before.</p>
            <p>If we did but know our selves, we should not dare to
be judging one another; but it is this same looking on
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94551:16"/>
evil as at a distance from us, as anothers, not our own
that makes us so severe towards others.</p>
            <p>4. It shews the reason of all that <hi>wickedness,</hi> that
<hi>enmity, pride, cruelty,</hi> &amp;c. that now breaks forth in the
world, and abounds every where; What is the matter?
How comes this to pass? Why God is ripping up the
heart of man, opening the heart of man, and so that
which is in it gushes out and appears. God is stirring
the sink, and that makes it send forth that noisom sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that offends every nostril.</p>
            <p>5. It may be unto us a ground to qualifie our spirits,
and make them willing to enter into Gods <hi>Furnace,</hi>
and quietly to endure the force of that <hi>fire</hi> which he in
wisdom sees needful to purge out this wickedness, and
purifie the heart by.</p>
            <p>What sober spirit that has the real sence of such
pollution in him, would not loath himself, desire to
be delivered from himself, and be willing to have the
fire kindled, and so burn upon him, (though it did
scortch and pain him unsufferably,) as to consume and
devour this filth.</p>
            <p>Never willhe wonder at the sharpness of God, who
is sencible of the desperate evil of his own heart: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
can he be weary of the <hi>Refiners</hi> fire, who is weary
enough of his own corrupt heart. 'Tis because we
know not our own hearts, that we think God might
cure us with less launcing. When we come to know
our selves, nothing will be more burdensom to us then
ourselves, and nothing will be more welcom then that
sword which is sharp enough, and that hand which
comes resolutely enough, and strikes home enough, to
let out the very life of our hearts, which when once
done will make us happy.</p>
