            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOR theſe thirty yeares paſt, it hath been obſerved, That thoſe in publique Place or Truſt have plotted and contrived little, but how to enrich themſelves; Whether you look upon <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> or <hi>Puritane:</hi> Moſt, if not all of both, laying about them like mad, untill they could ſay with <hi>Dives; Soule, thou haſt enough laid up for many years; eat, drinke, and take thy reſt!</hi>

            <p>In all which time, and with the generality of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the publique good hath been no further cared for, then the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did; That they have their Tale of <hi>Brick</hi> or <hi>Taxes:</hi> Being not ignorant, that the hard labour in Brick-making, with the want of <hi>Straw,</hi> had made the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> cry, and not without feare that that cry was come up to Heaven.</p>

                  <item>3. Vent our homebred Commodities to far more reputation, and much more Cuſtome, and benefit to the Merchant and the Nation.</item>

                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:55923:12"/>4. Return the Merchandiſes of other Countries at far cheaper rates then now they are, to the great good of the Realm in general.</item>
                  <item>5. Make the Land powerfull, by increaſing and multiplying of Ships, Mariners, and People.</item>
                  <item>6. Make the peoples Taking in generall much more every day then now they are, which (by Gods help) will grow continually more and more by the great Concourſe and Comerce that will come by ſetled Conſtitutions and convenient Priviledges, as in other parts they do, by this their great freedome of Trade.</item>
               </list>
               <p>If this and much more be done in other Countries (where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing groweth) Then how much might we make, where ſo great abundance and variety of homebred Commodities and rich Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials groweth for the people to work upon, and plentiful meanes to do it withall, which other Nations have not, nor cannot want, but of neceſſity muſt be furniſhed from hence? And now whereas our Merchandiſing is wilde, utterly confuſed and out of frame, (as at large appeareth) a <hi>State-Merchant</hi> will roundly and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bring all the premiſes to paſſe, fill the Havens with Ships, thoſe Ships with Mariners, the Nation full of Merchants, their Houſes full of Outlandiſh Commodities, and the STATES Coffers full of Coyn, (as in other parts they do) And the people ſhall have juſt cauſe to hold in happy memory the Beginners of ſo profitable, praiſe-worthy, and renowned a work: This, (with other that might be added) being the true <hi>Philoſophers ſtone,</hi> to make a rich and potent State, and a happy people, only by ſetling as before; whereby the people may have fulneſſe of Trade and Manufacture, and the Government made both honourable and profitable.</p>
               <p>There's but one Objection againſt this noble and gallant Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; which is,—They who ſhall adventure as a <hi>State-Merchant,</hi> muſt expect to loſe for divers years, as in all new Beginnings of Trade men do. The anſwer is, That the Publiſher of this will undertake to lay down a way how to bring in 10. 15. or 20. in the Hundred profit, from the firſt, as evidently as a man ſhall expect 8 <hi>percent.</hi> upon good Security.</p>
