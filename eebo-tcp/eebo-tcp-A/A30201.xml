            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <l>WHoe'er thou art that shalt peruse this Book,</l>
            <l>This may inform thee, when I undertook</l>
            <l>To write these Lines, it was not my Design</l>
            <l>To publish this imperfect Work of mine:</l>
            <l>Composed only for Diversion's sake.</l>
            <l>But being inclin'd to think thou may'st partake</l>
            <l>Some benefit thereby, I have thought fit,</l>
            <l>(Imperfect as it is) to publish it.</l>
            <l>The Subjects are a part of the Contents,</l>
            <l>Both of the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New Testaments;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The Word are for the most part all the same,</l>
            <l>(For I affected Plainness more than Fame)</l>
            <l>Nor could'st thou hope to have it better done:</l>
            <l>For I'm no Poet, nor a Poet's Son</l>
            <l>But a Mechanick, guided by no rule,</l>
            <l>But what I gained in a Grammar School.</l>
            <l>In my Minority: I can't commend it,</l>
            <l>Such as it is into the World I send it,</l>
            <l>And should be glad to see some Hand to mend it.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:41966:3"/>
Would but those Men whose Genius leads them to't,</l>
            <l>And who have time and parts wherewith to do't,</l>
            <l>Imploy their Pens in such a Task as this,</l>
            <l>'I would be a most delightsome Exercise,</l>
            <l>Of Profit to themselves and others too:</l>
            <l>If what the Learned <hi>Herbert</hi> says, holds true,</l>
            <l>A Verse may find him, whom a Sermon flies,</l>
            <l>And turn Delight into a Sacrifice;</l>
            <l>Thus I conclude, and wish it as delighting</l>
            <l>To thee in reading as to me in writing.</l>

                  <l>IN ancient Times, e'er <hi>Israel</hi> knew the way</l>
                  <l>Of kingly Power, when Judges bore the sway,</l>
                  <l>A certain Man of <hi>Bethlehem Juda</hi> fled,</l>
                  <l>By Reason of a Famine that o'erspread</l>
                  <l>The Land, into the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> where</l>
                  <l>He and his Wife, and Sons, sojourners were.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:41966:4"/>
His Name <hi>Elimelech,</hi> his eldest Son</l>
                  <l>Was called <hi>Mahlon,</hi> t'other <hi>Chilion.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>His Wife was <hi>Naomi,</hi> Ephrathites they were:</l>
                  <l>They went to <hi>Moab</hi> and continued there:</l>
                  <l>Where of her Husband <hi>Naomi</hi> was bereft,</l>
                  <l>And only she, and her Two Sons were left:</l>
                  <l>Who took them Wives of <hi>Moab</hi> in their Youth:</l>
                  <l>The Name of one was <hi>Orpah,</hi> t'other <hi>Ruth:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And there they died e'er twice Five Years were gone;</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Naomi</hi> was wholly left alone.</l>
                  <l>Then she arose, and her Step-daughters with her,</l>
                  <l>To leave the Land of <hi>Moab</hi> altogether:</l>
                  <l>For she had heard the Lord had visited</l>
                  <l>Her native Country, with increase of Bread.</l>
                  <l>Wherefore the Land of <hi>Moab</hi> she forsook,</l>
                  <l>And to her native Place her course she took,</l>
                  <l>Her Daughters with her: Whom she did desire,</l>
                  <l>That to their Mother's House they would retire:</l>
                  <l>The Lord, said she, be kind to you agen,</l>
                  <l>As you to me, and to the dead have been:</l>
                  <l>God grant you each may be with Husbands blest,</l>
                  <l>And in th' Enjoyment of them, both find rest.</l>
                  <l>Then she embraced them, and there withal,</l>
                  <l>Down from their Cheeks, the Tears began to fall:</l>
                  <l>They wept aloud, and said, Most surely we</l>
                  <l>Unto thy People will return with thee.</l>
                  <l>But <hi>Naomi</hi> replied, Wherefore will ye,</l>
                  <l>My Daughters, thus resolve to go with me?</l>
                  <l>Are there yet any more Sons in my Womb,</l>
                  <l>That may your Husbands be in time to come?</l>
                  <l>Return again, my Daughters, go your way,</l>
                  <l>For I'm too Old to marry: Should I say</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:41966:4"/>
I've Hope? Should I this Night conceive a Son?</l>
                  <l>Would either of you stay till he is grown?</l>
                  <l>Would you so long without an Husband live?</l>
                  <l>Nay, nay, my Daughters, for it doth me grieve</l>
                  <l>Exceedingly, even for your sakes, that I</l>
                  <l>Do under this so great Affliction lie.</l>
                  <l>And here they wept again: And <hi>Orpah</hi> kiss'd</l>
                  <l>Her Mother, but <hi>Ruth</hi> would not be dismiss'd</l>
                  <l>But clave unto her: Unto whom she spake</l>
                  <l>And said, Behold, thy Sister is gone back,</l>
                  <l>With her own Gods, and People to abide,</l>
                  <l>Go thou along with her. But <hi>Ruth</hi> reply'd,</l>
                  <l>Intreat me not to leave thee, or return:</l>
                  <l>For where thou goest, I'll go, where thou sojourn,</l>
                  <l>I'll sojourn also: And what People's thine,</l>
                  <l>And who thy God, the same shall both be mine:</l>
                  <l>Where thou shalt die, there will I die likewise,</l>
                  <l>And I'll be buried where thy Body lies:</l>
                  <l>The Lord do so to me, and more, if I</l>
                  <l>Do leave thee, or forsake thee till I die.</l>
                  <l>And when she saw the Purpose of her Heart,</l>
                  <l>She left off to desire her to depart.</l>
                  <l>So they Two travelled along together</l>
                  <l>To <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and when they were come thither,</l>
                  <l>Behold! the People were surpriz'd, and cried</l>
                  <l>What is this <hi>Naomi?</hi> But she reply'd,</l>
                  <l>Oh! call me <hi>Mara,</hi> and not <hi>Naomi:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>For I have been afflicted bitterly.</l>
                  <l>I went out from you full, but now I come.</l>
                  <l>As it hath pleased God, quite empty home:</l>
                  <l>Why then call ye me <hi>Naomi?</hi> Since I</l>
                  <l>Have been afflicted so exceedingly.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41966:5"/>
So <hi>Naomi</hi> return'd, and <hi>Ruth</hi> together,</l>
                  <l>Who had come from the Land of <hi>Moab</hi> with her:</l>
                  <l>And unto <hi>Bethlem Juda</hi> did they come,</l>
                  <l>Just as the Barley Harvest was begun.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>THere was a Man of Kin to <hi>Naomi,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>One that was of her Husband's Family,</l>
                  <l>His Name was <hi>Boaz,</hi> and his Wealth was great.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Ruth</hi> the Moabitess did intreat</l>
                  <l>Her Mother's leave, that she might go, and gather</l>
                  <l>Some Ears of Corn, where she should most find favour:</l>
                  <l>Go, Daughter, go, said she. She went, and came</l>
                  <l>Near to the Reapers, to glean after them:</l>
                  <l>And, lo, it was her hap to light among</l>
                  <l>The Reapers, which to <hi>Boaz</hi> did belong.</l>
                  <l>Behold, now <hi>Boaz</hi> came from <hi>Bethlehem</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Unto his Reapers, and saluted them,</l>
                  <l>And they bless'd him again: and he inquired</l>
                  <l>Of him that was set over them he hired,</l>
                  <l>From whence the Damsel was, and was inform'd</l>
                  <l>She was the Moabitess that return'd</l>
                  <l>With <hi>Naomi:</hi> And she did ask, said he,</l>
                  <l>That here amongst the Reapers she might be,</l>
                  <l>And that she might have liberty to glean</l>
                  <l>Among the Sheaves: And she all day hath been,</l>
                  <l>Even from the morning until now, with us,</l>
                  <l>That she hath stay'd a little in the House.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:41966:5"/>
Then <hi>Boaz</hi> said to <hi>Ruth,</hi> Observe my Daughter,</l>
                  <l>That thou go not from hence, or follow after</l>
                  <l>The Reapers of another Field, but where</l>
                  <l>My Maidens are, see that thou tarry there:</l>
                  <l>Observe what Field they reap, and go thou there,</l>
                  <l>Have I not charg'd the young Men to forbear</l>
                  <l>To touch thee? And when thou dost thirst, approach</l>
                  <l>And drink of what the Youths have set abroach.</l>
                  <l>Then she fell on her Face, and to the Ground</l>
                  <l>She bow'd her self, and said, Why have I found</l>
                  <l>Such favour in thine Eyes, That thou, to me</l>
                  <l>Who am a Stranger, should so courteous be?</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Boaz</hi> said, It hath been fully shown</l>
                  <l>To me, what to thy Mother-in Law thou'st done,</l>
                  <l>Since of thine Husband thou hast been bereft:</l>
                  <l>How thou thy Father and thy Mother left,</l>
                  <l>And thine own native Land to come unto</l>
                  <l>A Land, which thou before didst never know:</l>
                  <l>The Lord, the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Defence</l>
                  <l>Whom now thou'st chosen, be thy recompence.</l>
                  <l>Then said she, let me in thy sight, my Lord,</l>
                  <l>Find favour, in that thou dost thus afford</l>
                  <l>Me Comfort, and since thou so kind to me</l>
                  <l>Dost speak, though I thereof unworthy be</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Boaz</hi> said, at Meal-time come thou near,</l>
                  <l>Eat of the Bread, and dip i'th' Vinegar.</l>
                  <l>And by the Reapers she sate down to Meat,</l>
                  <l>He gave her parched Corn, and she did eat,</l>
                  <l>And was suffic'd, and left, and rose to glean:</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Boaz</hi> gave Command to the young Men,</l>
                  <l>Let her come in among the Sheaves, said he,</l>
                  <l>To glean, and let her not reproached be:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:41966:6"/>
Let fall some handfuls also purposely,</l>
                  <l>And let her take them without injury.</l>
                  <l>So she till Even glean'd, and then beat out</l>
                  <l>Her Barly, being an <hi>Ephah</hi> or thereabout.</l>
                  <l>She took it up, and to the City went,</l>
                  <l>And to her Mother-in-Law did it present:</l>
                  <l>And what she had reserv'd to her she gave,</l>
                  <l>When she had took what she design'd to have.</l>
                  <l>Then unto her, her Mother-in-Law did say,</l>
                  <l>In what Field hast thou been to glean to day?</l>
                  <l>And where hast thou been working? Blest be he,</l>
                  <l>That thus hath taken Cognizance of thee.</l>
                  <l>She told with whom, and furthermore did say,</l>
                  <l>The Man's Name's <hi>Boaz,</hi> Where I wrought to day.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Naomi</hi> reply'd, May he be blest,</l>
                  <l>Even of the Lord, whose Kindness manifest</l>
                  <l>Unto the Living and the Dead hath been:</l>
                  <l>The Man's our Kinsman, yea the next of kin.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Ruth</hi> the Moabitess said, He gave</l>
                  <l>Me likewise a Commandment not to leave,</l>
                  <l>Or to depart, from following his young Men,</l>
                  <l>Until they had brought all his Harvest in.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Naomi</hi> said unto <hi>Ruth,</hi> My Daughter,</l>
                  <l>'Tis good that thou observe to follow after</l>
                  <l>His Maidens, that they meet thee not elsewhere.</l>
                  <l>So she to <hi>Boaz</hi>'s Maidens still kept near,</l>
                  <l>Till Barley and Wheat Harvest both, she saw</l>
                  <l>Were done, and she dwelt with her Mother-in-Law.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>THen <hi>Naomi</hi> said, Shall I not, my Daughter,</l>
                  <l>Seek Rest for thee, that thou do well hereafter?</l>
                  <l>And is not <hi>Boaz,</hi> with whose Maids thou wast,</l>
                  <l>One of the nearest Kinsmen that thou hast?</l>
                  <l>Behold, this Night he in his Threshing-Floor</l>
                  <l>Is winnowing Barley, wash thy self therefore,</l>
                  <l>Anoint thee, put thy Cloaths on, and get down</l>
                  <l>Unto the Floor; but make not thy self known,</l>
                  <l>Till he hath eat and drank, and shall prepare</l>
                  <l>To lie him down; then take good notice where</l>
                  <l>He goes about to take his Night's Repose,</l>
                  <l>And go thou in there, and lift up the Cloaths</l>
                  <l>From off his Feet, and likewise lay thee down,</l>
                  <l>And what thou hast to do he will make known.</l>
                  <l>And she made answer, Whatsoever thou</l>
                  <l>Hast me commanded, will I gladly do.</l>
                  <l>And down unto the Floor she hasted, and</l>
                  <l>Forthwith fulfill'd her Mother-in-Law's Command.</l>
                  <l>So now when <hi>Boaz</hi> had his Heart refresh'd,</l>
                  <l>With Meat and Drink, he laid him down to rest,</l>
                  <l>Near to the heap of Corn; she softly came,</l>
                  <l>Uncover'd's Feet, and lay down by the same.</l>
                  <l>And, lo! at Midnight, as he turn'd him round,</l>
                  <l>He was afraid, for at his Feet he found</l>
                  <l>A Woman lay: Who art thou? then said he.</l>
                  <l>I am thine Handmaid <hi>Ruth,</hi> replyed she,</l>
                  <l>Over thine Handmaid therefore spread thy Skirt,</l>
                  <l>I pray, because thou a near Kinsman art.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41966:7"/>
Blessed be thou, said he, because thou hast</l>
                  <l>Made manifest more Kindness at the last,</l>
                  <l>Than at the first, in that thou didst, my Daughter,</l>
                  <l>No young Men, whether poor or rich, go after:</l>
                  <l>And now, my Daughter, be not thou afraid,</l>
                  <l>I will do to thee all that thou hast said:</l>
                  <l>For all the City of my People knows,</l>
                  <l>Thou art a Woman truly vertuous;</l>
                  <l>And now, though I am Kin undoubtedly,</l>
                  <l>Yet there is one that's nearer Kin than I:</l>
                  <l>Tarry this Night, and when 'tis Morning light,</l>
                  <l>If he will like a Kinsman do thee right,</l>
                  <l>We'll let him, but if not, I my self will,</l>
                  <l>As the Lord lives, till Morning lie thou still.</l>
                  <l>And till the Morning at his Feet she lay,</l>
                  <l>And then arose about the break of Day;</l>
                  <l>And he gave her a Charge, not to declare</l>
                  <l>That there had any Womankind been there:</l>
                  <l>He also said, Bring here thy Veil, and hold</l>
                  <l>To me; she did, and thereinto he told</l>
                  <l>Six Measures full of Barley, and did lay</l>
                  <l>It on her, and she hasted thence away.</l>
                  <l>And when unto her Mother-in-Law she came,</l>
                  <l>Art thou, said she, my Daughter, come again?</l>
                  <l>Then what the Man had done she told, and said,</l>
                  <l>He these six Measures full of Barley laid</l>
                  <l>Upon me, for said he, This I bestow,</l>
                  <l>Least to thy Mother thou should'st empty go.</l>
                  <l>Then, said she, sit still Daughter, till thou see</l>
                  <l>What the Event of this Intrigue will be;</l>
                  <l>For till the Man this Day hath made an end,</l>
                  <l>No Satisfaction will on him attend.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>AND <hi>Boaz</hi> went up to the City Gate,</l>
                  <l>And after a short space, while there he sate,</l>
                  <l>The Kinsman, of whom he had spoke, came by,</l>
                  <l>To whom he said, Ho, such a one, draw nigh,</l>
                  <l>And sit down here: He came and sate him down:</l>
                  <l>Then he took Ten Men, Elders of the Town,</l>
                  <l>And caus'd them to sit down. Then to the Man</l>
                  <l>That was of Kin, thus he his Speech began,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Naomi,</hi> said he, who not long since sojourn'd</l>
                  <l>Amongst the Moabites, is now return'd;</l>
                  <l>And doth intend to sell a piece of Ground,</l>
                  <l>The which <hi>Elimelech</hi> our Brother own'd:</l>
                  <l>And now to give thee notice, I thought fit,</l>
                  <l>That if thou pleasest, thou may'st purchase it,</l>
                  <l>In Presence of these Men assembled here:</l>
                  <l>Then if thou wilt redeem it, now declare</l>
                  <l>Thy Mind, but if thou wilt not, then let me,</l>
                  <l>For thou art next of Kin, and I next thee.</l>
                  <l>Then said the Kinsman, I will it redeem.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Boaz</hi> reply'd, if good to thee it seem,</l>
                  <l>To buy it of the Hand of <hi>Naomi,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Thou also art oblig'd the same to buy</l>
                  <l>Of <hi>Ruth</hi> the Moabitess, Wife o'th' dead,</l>
                  <l>On his Inheritance to raise up Seed.</l>
                  <l>The Kinsman said, I cannot do this thing</l>
                  <l>My self, least I an Inconvenience bring</l>
                  <l>Upon mine own Inheritance, what's mine</l>
                  <l>By right, therefore I now to thee resign.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:41966:8"/>
Now this in <hi>Israel</hi> did a Custom stand,</l>
                  <l>Concerning changing and redeeming Land;</l>
                  <l>To put all Controversie to an end,</l>
                  <l>A Man pluck'd off his Shooe, and gave his Friend;</l>
                  <l>And this in <hi>Israel</hi> was an Evidence,</l>
                  <l>When e'er they changed an Inheritance.</l>
                  <l>Then said the Kinsman unto <hi>Boaz,</hi> do</l>
                  <l>Thou take my Right. And off he pluck'd his Shooe</l>
                  <l>Then <hi>Boaz</hi> to the Elders thus did say,</l>
                  <l>And to the People, All of you this Day</l>
                  <l>Appear for me as Witnesses, that I</l>
                  <l>Have bought all of the hand of <hi>Naomi,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>That was <hi>Elimelech</hi>'s, or did belong</l>
                  <l>Either to <hi>Mahlon</hi> or to <hi>Chilion:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And <hi>Ruth</hi> the Moabitess, who some time</l>
                  <l>Was <hi>Mahlon</hi>'s Wife, I've purchas'd to be mine,</l>
                  <l>Still to preserve alive the dead Man's Name</l>
                  <l>On his Inheritance, least that the same</l>
                  <l>Should in the Gate where he inhabited,</l>
                  <l>Or 'mongst his Brethren be extinguished:</l>
                  <l>Behold, this Day, my Witnesses you are.</l>
                  <l>Then all the People that were present there,</l>
                  <l>And Elders said, We are thy Witnesses:</l>
                  <l>May God this Woman thou hast taken bless,</l>
                  <l>That she like <hi>Rachel,</hi> and like <hi>Leah</hi> be,</l>
                  <l>Which two did build up <hi>Israel</hi>'s Family:</l>
                  <l>And thou in <hi>Ephratah</hi> exalt thy Name,</l>
                  <l>And through the Town of <hi>Bethlem</hi> spread thy Fame,</l>
                  <l>And may the Seed which God shall give to thee</l>
                  <l>Of this young Woman, full as prosperous be,</l>
                  <l>As was the House of <hi>Pharez</hi> heretofore,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>(Pharez,</hi> whom <hi>Tamar</hi> unto <hi>Judah</hi> bore.)</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:41966:8"/>
So he took <hi>Ruth,</hi> and as his Wife he knew her,</l>
                  <l>And God was pleased, when he went in to her,</l>
                  <l>To grant the Blessing of Conception,</l>
                  <l>And she accordingly bare him a Son.</l>
                  <l>Then said the Women, Blessed be the Lord!</l>
                  <l>Bless thou him <hi>Naomi,</hi> who doth afford</l>
                  <l>To thee this Day a Kinsman, which shall be</l>
                  <l>Famous in <hi>Israel;</hi> and shall be to thee</l>
                  <l>As the Restorer of thy Life again,</l>
                  <l>And in thy drooping Age shall thee sustain:</l>
                  <l>For that thy Daughter-in-Law, who loves thee well</l>
                  <l>And in thy Sight doth Seven Sons excel,</l>
                  <l>Hath born this Child. Then <hi>Naomi</hi> took the Boy</l>
                  <l>To Nurse, and did him in her Bosom lay:</l>
                  <l>Her Neighbours too, gave him a Name, for why,</l>
                  <l>This Son, say they, is born to <hi>Naomi:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>They call'd him <hi>Obed,</hi> from whose Loins did spring</l>

                  <l>WHen <hi>Israel's</hi> Sins th' Almighty did provoke,</l>
                  <l>To make them subject to <hi>Philistine</hi> Yoke</l>
                  <l>For forty Years: In <hi>Zorah</hi> dwelt a Man,</l>
                  <l>His Name <hi>Manoah,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Dan;</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>His Wife was barren, unto whom appeared</l>
                  <l>The Angel of the Lord, and thus declared:</l>
                  <l>Though thou, said he, art barren, time shall come</l>
                  <l>Thou shalt enjoy the Blessing of thy Womb;</l>
                  <l>Now therefore I intreat thee to refrain</l>
                  <l>From Wine, strong Drink, and things that are unclean.</l>
                  <l>For lo, thou shalt conceive and bear a Son,</l>
                  <l>Upon whose Head there shall no Razor come,</l>
                  <l>For he to God a Nazarite shall be,</l>
                  <l>And shall begin to set his People free</l>
                  <l>From the Philistine Yoke. The VVoman came</l>
                  <l>And told her Husband, she had seen a Man</l>
                  <l>Of God, his dreadful look made me, said she,</l>
                  <l>Think him an Angel of the Lord to be:</l>
                  <l>But I enquired not from whence he came,</l>
                  <l>Neither did he make known to me his Name:</l>
                  <l>But thus he said, Thou shalt conceive a Son;</l>
                  <l>Wherefore Strong Drink and Wine, see that thou shun,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:41966:9"/>
And have a care that thou be not defil'd</l>
                  <l>With things that are unclean; for why, the Child</l>
                  <l>Shall from his Separation from the Womb,</l>
                  <l>Become a Nazarite, ev'n to his Tomb.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Manoah</hi> then did supplicate the Lord,</l>
                  <l>And said, O Lord, be pleased to afford</l>
                  <l>This Favour unto me, to send again</l>
                  <l>The Man of God, more fully to explain</l>
                  <l>Thy Will to us, that we may rightly know,</l>
                  <l>When this Child shall be born, what we must do.</l>
                  <l>And to <hi>Manoah</hi>'s Prayer God gave Ear,</l>
                  <l>And to his Wife the Angel did appear</l>
                  <l>Again, as she did in the Field retire,</l>
                  <l>At such time as her Husband was not nigh her.</l>
                  <l>And she made haste, and ran, and streight declared</l>
                  <l>Unto her Husband, that the Man appeared</l>
                  <l>Again, whom she had seen the other Day.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Manoah</hi> then arose, and went his way,</l>
                  <l>And when he came, he said, Art thou the Man</l>
                  <l>That spakest to my Wife? He said, I am:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Manoah</hi> said, Now let thy Words be true:</l>
                  <l>How shall we use the Child, what must we do?</l>
                  <l>Then said the Angel of the Lord, Let her</l>
                  <l>Of all that I have charged her beware:</l>
                  <l>She may not taste of what comes of the Vine,</l>
                  <l>Nor may she drink strong Drink, or any Wine,</l>
                  <l>Nor may she eat of things that are unclean,</l>
                  <l>From all that I have said, let her refrain.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Manoah</hi> said unto the Angel, stay</l>
                  <l>With us, till we have dress'd a Kid, I pray.</l>
                  <l>But he reply'd, though thou shalt me detain,</l>
                  <l>I'll eat no Bread, but if thou dost design</l>

A Sacrifice unto the Lord, then offer:</l>
                  <l>For ne'er till now, <hi>Manoah</hi> did discover</l>
                  <l>It was a Man of God he spake unto:</l>
                  <l>Then said he to the Angel, Let me know</l>
                  <l>Thy Name, that when these things shall be perform'd,</l>
                  <l>The Honour due to thee may be return'd.</l>
                  <l>Whereto the Man of God made this Reply,</l>
                  <l>Why askest thou, since 'tis a Mystery?</l>
                  <l>So he a Kid, and a Meat-Off'ring took,</l>
                  <l>And offer'd to the Lord upon a Rock:</l>
                  <l>And there the Man of God did wondrously,</l>
                  <l>The whilst <hi>Manoah</hi> and his Wife stood by:</l>
                  <l>For as the Altar did send up the Flame,</l>
                  <l>The Man of God ascended in the same:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Manoah</hi> and his Wife stood looking on,</l>
                  <l>And on their Faces to the Ground fell down.</l>
                  <l>(But then the Angel did appear no more)</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Manoah</hi> then knew who he was: Therefore</l>
                  <l>He said unto his Wife, Most surely we</l>
                  <l>Shall die, for we the Face of God did see.</l>
                  <l>But she reply'd, If God would such a thing,</l>
                  <l>He would not now accept our Offering,</l>
                  <l>Or would he have to us these things made known,</l>
                  <l>Or told us, as at this time he hath done.</l>
                  <l>And now (according to the Angel's Word)</l>
                  <l>The Woman bare a Son, to whom the Lord</l>
                  <l>Was pleas'd, his Blessing graciously to give;</l>
                  <l>She call'd him <hi>Sampson,</hi> and the Child did thrive:</l>
                  <l>And lo! the Spirit of the Lord began,</l>
                  <l>At times to move him in the Camp of <hi>Dan.</hi>

                  <l>NOw down to <hi>Timnah Sampson</hi>'s Steps incline,</l>
                  <l>Where seeing the Daughter of a Philistine,</l>
                  <l>He came up and did of his Parents crave,</l>
                  <l>That he in Marriage might the Woman have.</l>
                  <l>Then thus his Father and his Mother said</l>
                  <l>'Mongst all thy Kin canst thou find ne'er a Maid;</l>
                  <l>Nor yet among my People, fit to make</l>
                  <l>A Wife, but thou wilt this Philistine take,</l>
                  <l>Of Race uncircumcised? He replied,</l>
                  <l>Get her for me, for I'm well satisfied.</l>
                  <l>But neither of his Parents then did know,</l>
                  <l>It was the Lord that moved him thereto,</l>
                  <l>To seek a way to accomplish his Designs,</l>
                  <l>Upon the then o'er-ruling Philistines.</l>
                  <l>Then <hi>Sampson</hi> and his Parents both went down</l>
                  <l>To <hi>Timnah,</hi> and as they came near the Town,</l>
                  <l>Among the Vineyards a young Lion roar'd:</l>
                  <l>Then on him came the Spirit of the Lord,</l>
                  <l>And though unarm'd, he rent him like a Kid,</l>
                  <l>But he discover'd not to them the Deed:</l>
                  <l>And he went down, and with the Woman treated,</l>
                  <l>And was well pleas'd to have the Match compleated.</l>
                  <l>And in a while as he return'd again</l>
                  <l>To take his Wife, behold, where he had slain</l>
                  <l>The Beast, he there a Swarm of Bees set Eye on,</l>
                  <l>And Honey in the Carcase of the Lion:</l>
                  <l>He took thereof, and eating, on he wen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <l>And to his Parents did a part present,</l>

                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:41966:11"/>
And they did also eat, but did not know</l>
                  <l>That from the Lion's Carcase it did flow.</l>
                  <l>So down his Father went unto the Woman,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Sampson</hi> made a Feast, as it was common</l>
                  <l>Among young Men. The Philistines provide</l>
                  <l>Thirty Companions with him to abide;</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Sampson</hi> said unto them, now behold,</l>
                  <l>I have a Riddle for you to unfold,</l>
                  <l>Which if you do before the Seven Days Feast</l>
                  <l>Be ended, I will give to every Guest</l>
                  <l>A Sheet and change of Garments, but if ye</l>
                  <l>Cannot declare it, you shall give to me</l>
                  <l>Full Thirty Sheets, and Thirty Changes too:</l>
                  <l>Then said they, What's thy Riddle, let us know?</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Sampson</hi> said, The Eater sent forth Meat,</l>
                  <l>And from the Strong there came a thing most sweet.</l>
                  <l>And they could not in Three Days find it out,</l>
                  <l>Wherefore before the seventh came about,</l>
                  <l>They said unto his Wife, Thou must entice</l>
                  <l>Thy Husband to discover this Device,</l>
                  <l>Least we burn thee, and all thy Father's House:</l>
                  <l>Is it not so, that ye have called us</l>
                  <l>To make a Spoil? And <hi>Sampson</hi>'s Wife wept sore,</l>
                  <l>And said, Thou dost but hate me, and no more;</l>
                  <l>To put a Riddle to my Countrymen,</l>
                  <l>And not tell't me: And he reply'd agen,</l>
                  <l>I have not told my Father or my Mother,</l>
                  <l>And shall I now to thee this thing discover.</l>
                  <l>And she continually before him wept,</l>
                  <l>During the time the Feasting Days were kept:</l>
                  <l>And now behold it came to pass that he,</l>
                  <l>By reason of her Importunity,</l>

                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:41966:11"/>
Did on the Seventh Day to her unfold</l>
                  <l>The Riddle, which she to her Brethren told;</l>
                  <l>And e'er the Sun went down, on that same Day,</l>
                  <l>The Philistines to <hi>Sampson</hi> thus did say,</l>
                  <l>What is more sweet than Honey? What more strong</l>
                  <l>Than is a Lion? And he said, How long</l>
                  <l>Would it have been, e'er you had understood</l>
                  <l>This thing had you not with my Heifer plow'd?</l>
                  <l>Then came the Spirit of the Lord upon</l>
                  <l>Him, and he hasted down to <hi>Askelon,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And Thirty of the Philistines he slew,</l>
                  <l>And took their Cloaths, and gave the Garments due</l>
                  <l>To every one of them that had disclosed</l>
                  <l>The meaning of the Riddle he proposed,</l>
                  <l>And towards them his Anger fiercely burned,</l>
                  <l>And he unto his Father's House returned.</l>
                  <l>But <hi>Sampson</hi>'s Wife was given unto one</l>

                  <l>To her into her Chamber he would go,</l>

                  <l>Wherefore I gave consent, and thy Friend took her.</l>
                  <l>Doth not her Sister's Beauty hers exceed,</l>

                  <l>Into the standing Corn he let them go,</l>

                  <l>And all the Olives of the Philistines.</l>
                  <l>Then they enquired who this thing had done,</l>

                  <l>And the Philistines came up, full of Wrath,</l>
                  <l>And burnt with Fire, her and her Father both.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Sampson</hi> said though you have done this thing,</l>
                  <l>A farther Evil I will on you bring,</l>
                  <l>And my avenging Hand shall cease hereafter:</l>
                  <l>And hip and thigh he smote them with great slaughter:</l>
                  <l>And he return'd, and came up to the top</l>
                  <l>Of <hi>Etam,</hi> and dwelt there upon the Rock.</l>
                  <l>Then the Philistines up to <hi>Judah</hi> went,</l>
                  <l>And in the Vale of <hi>Lehi</hi> pitch'd their Tent.</l>
                  <l>Then said the Men of <hi>Judah</hi> for what reason</l>
                  <l>Are you come up against us at this season?</l>
                  <l>And they made answer, we are come to bind</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Sampson,</hi> to do to him in the same kind</l>
                  <l>As he hath done to us: Then there went up</l>
                  <l>Three thousand Men of <hi>Judah</hi> to the top</l>
                  <l>Of the Rock <hi>Etam,</hi> and to <hi>Sampson</hi> said,</l>
                  <l>Do'st thou not know that we have long obey'd</l>
                  <l>The Philistines? Wherefore is it that thou</l>
                  <l>Hast done this thing, to bring this Evil now,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:41966:12"/>
Upon us, let us know it? Then said he</l>
                  <l>I did to them, as they have done to me:</l>
                  <l>Then said they we are come, and have brought bands,</l>
                  <l>To bind, and give thee up into their hands:</l>
                  <l>And he made answer, you shall swear unto me,</l>
                  <l>That you your selves no Injury will do me:</l>
                  <l>And they reply'd, No, no, we will but bind thee,</l>
                  <l>We will not kill thee, but to them resign thee.</l>
                  <l>And they took two new Cords, and therewith tied him,</l>
                  <l>And from the Rock where he abode convey him:</l>
                  <l>Whom when they to the Camp at <hi>Lehi</hi> brought</l>
                  <l>The Philistines against him gave a shout:</l>
                  <l>And mightily the Spirit of the Lord</l>
                  <l>Came on him, and like burning Flax each cord</l>
                  <l>That was upon his Arms became, the Bands</l>
                  <l>Were likewise separated from his Hands.</l>
                  <l>And he the Jawbone of an Ass espied,</l>
                  <l>And took and smote them till a Thousand died:</l>
                  <l>Then said he with an Ass's Jawbone I</l>
                  <l>Have made mine Enemies in heaps to lie:</l>
                  <l>Behold I have destroy'd a Thousand Men</l>
                  <l>With this same worthless Ass's Jaw: And when</l>
                  <l>He made an end to speak, it came to pass</l>
                  <l>He cast away the Jawbone of the Ass,</l>
                  <l>And said, Now let the place where this was done</l>
                  <l>Be by the Name of <hi>Ramath-Lehi</hi> known.</l>
                  <l>And he was sore a thirst, and to the Lord</l>
                  <l>He cried, and said, O Lord, thou didst afford</l>
                  <l>This great Deliverance, and now shall I,</l>
                  <l>By reason of my Thirst fall down and die,</l>
                  <l>And fall into the most accursed Hands</l>
                  <l>Of these uncircumcis'd Philistine Bands?</l>

But God was pleas'd to cleave an hollow place,</l>
                  <l>Within the Jaw, from whence did Water pass:</l>
                  <l>Whereof when he had drank, his Spirit came</l>
                  <l>As heretofore, and he reviv'd again:</l>
                  <l>Wherefore that place, which is in <hi>Lehi,</hi> bore</l>
                  <l>Unto this Day the Name of <hi>En-hakkore.</hi>
                  </l>

                     <hi>Israel</hi> for Twenty Years did him obey.</l>

                  <l>All Night, to take him in the City Gate,</l>

With him, to bind him, to afflict him, we</l>
                  <l>Each one will give a great reward to thee.</l>
                  <l>And she to <hi>Sampson</hi> said, I pray thee, tell</l>
                  <l>Wherein thy Strength doth other Men excel,</l>
                  <l>And how thou may'st be bound: And he reply'd,</l>
                  <l>If they with Seven green Withs that ne'er were dried</l>
                  <l>Shall bind me Hand and Foot, I shall be then</l>
                  <l>As weak and impotent as other Men.</l>
                  <l>Then the Philistine Lords for her provide</l>
                  <l>The Seven green Withs which never had been dried,</l>
                  <l>And she therewith did bind him, (now there were</l>
                  <l>Men lying in wait whom she had placed there)</l>
                  <l>Then she cry'd out, and said, Now <hi>Sampson</hi> stand</l>
                  <l>Thy ground, for the Philistines are at hand.</l>
                  <l>And streight he brake the Withs, and they became</l>
                  <l>Like to a thred of Tow when toucht with flame:</l>
                  <l>So was his Strength not found out. Then said she,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Sampson,</hi> behold, thou hast deceived me,</l>
                  <l>And told me lyes: Therefore no longer blind me,</l>
                  <l>But tell, I pray thee, wherewith I may bind thee:</l>
                  <l>Bind me with Ropes that ne'er were us'd, said he;</l>
                  <l>Then weak as other Men are, shall I be:</l>
                  <l>She therefore took New Ropes, and bound him, and</l>
                  <l>Cry'd, <hi>Sampson,</hi> the Philistines are at Hand:</l>
                  <l>(And in the Chamber there were Men lay hid)</l>
                  <l>And from his Arms he brake them like a Thread.</l>
                  <l>Then said she, Thou hast mock'd me hitherto,</l>
                  <l>And told me Lyes: Now tell we what to do</l>
                  <l>To bind thee. He reply'd, Thou with the Web</l>

                  <l>Then she his Locks did fasten with the Pin,</l>

Shift, <hi>Sampson,</hi> for thy self; then he awoke,</l>
                  <l>And Pin and Web, and all away he took.</l>
                  <l>Then said she, How canst thou pretend to love me,</l>
                  <l>When thus thy Doing towards me disprove thee?</l>
                  <l>For now, behold, thou hast deceiv'd me thrice,</l>
                  <l>And hast not told me where thy great Strength lies.</l>
                  <l>At length his Soul being vext exceedingly,</l>
                  <l>By reason of her Importunity:</l>
                  <l>He told the Secrets of his Heart, and said,</l>
                  <l>Never yet Razor on my Head was laid;</l>
                  <l>For I have been to God a Nazarite,</l>
                  <l>Even from the Day that first I saw the Light:</l>
                  <l>Wherefore like other Men, if I am shaven,</l>
                  <l>I shall be weak, and of my Strength bereaven.</l>
                  <l>And when she saw that he had told her all</l>
                  <l>The Secrets of his Heart, she sent to call</l>
                  <l>The Lords of the Philistines, Come, said she,</l>
                  <l>This once, for now he hath made known to me</l>
                  <l>The very Truth. Then they came up together,</l>
                  <l>And brought the Money in their Hands to give her.</l>
                  <l>Then down to sleep upon her Knees she laid him,</l>
                  <l>And call'd a Man, who of his Locks betray'd him,</l>
                  <l>And to afflict him she began, and then</l>
                  <l>His Strength became like that of other Men:</l>
                  <l>Then said she, <hi>Sampson,</hi> thy Philistine Foes</l>
                  <l>Are just at hand: And he from sleep arose,</l>
                  <l>And as at other times went forth to shake him,</l>
                  <l>Not knowing that the Lord did now forsake him.</l>
                  <l>But the Philistines seized him, and brought</l>
                  <l>Him down to <hi>Gaza,</hi> having first put out</l>
                  <l>His Eyes, and did with brazen Fetters bind</l>
                  <l>And made him in the Prison-House to grind.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:41966:14"/>
Howbeit the Hair upon his Head began,</l>
                  <l>After he had been shaved, to grow again.</l>
                  <l>Then the Philistine Lords together met,</l>
                  <l>And a Thanksgiving day apart they set,</l>
                  <l>For to rejojce, and unto <hi>Dagon</hi> pay</l>
                  <l>Their highest Service, For our God, say they,</l>
                  <l>Did this: And when the People did behold</l>
                  <l>Poor Captive <hi>Sampson,</hi> they their God extoll'd,</l>
                  <l>And said, our God, Hath given into our hand,</l>
                  <l>Him that destroy'd us, and laid waste our Land.</l>
                  <l>And in their heighth of Mirth, they sent to call</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Sampson,</hi> to come and make sport for them all.</l>
                  <l>And from the Prison-House they brought him, and</l>
                  <l>Between the Pillars they set him to stand;</l>
                  <l>And there he made them Sport. Then to the Lad,</l>
                  <l>That led him by the Hand, thus <hi>Sampson</hi> said,</l>
                  <l>Let me now feel the Pillars that sustain</l>
                  <l>The House that I my self thereon may lean.</l>
                  <l>Now in the Home there was a mighty Throng</l>
                  <l>Of Men and Women gather'd, and among</l>
                  <l>Them, all the Lords of the Philistines were:</l>
                  <l>Besides, upon the Roof there did appear,</l>
                  <l>About Three thousand Men and Women, who</l>
                  <l>Beheld, while <hi>Sampson</hi> made them sport below.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Sampson</hi> calling on the Lord did say,</l>
                  <l>O Lord, my God, remember me, I pray,</l>
                  <l>This once give Strength, that I aveng'd may be</l>
                  <l>Of those Philistines who have blinded me.</l>
                  <l>And with his Right-hand and his Left, he held</l>
                  <l>Two middle Pillars which the House upheld;</l>
                  <l>And said, Let me with the Philistines die,</l>
                  <l>And then he bow'd himself most mightily:</l>

                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:41966:15"/>
And down the House fell on the Lords, and all</l>
                  <l>The People that were in't: So that the fall</l>
                  <l>Thereof, slew at his Dying many more,</l>
                  <l>Than he had slain in all his Life before.</l>
                  <l>Then did his Brethren, and his Kinsfolks come</l>
                  <l>And took him up, and brought him with them home,</l>
                  <l>And laid him in his Father's Sepulchre,</l>

Ye are the Salt o'th' Earth; but wherewith must</l>

Give not to Dogs the things that are Divine,</l>
                  <l>Neither cast ye your Pearls before the Swine,</l>
                  <l>Least that they should their Feet them trample under,</l>
                  <l>And turn upon you, and rent you asunder.</l>
                  <l>Ask, and obtain, seek, and ye shall find; do ye</l>
                  <l>Knock, and it shall be opened unto ye:</l>
                  <l>For he that seeks, shall find, that asks, obtain,</l>
                  <l>And he that knocks, shall an Admittance gain.</l>
                  <l>Or what Man is there of you, if his Son</l>
                  <l>Shall ask him Bread, will he give him a Stone?</l>
                  <l>Or if he ask a Fish, will he bestow</l>
                  <l>A Serpent? If then ye being evil know</l>

                  <l>To them that ask him, shall your Heav'nly Father?</l>
                  <l>Then what you wou'd Men shou'd to you, so do</l>
                  <l>To them: for that's the Law and Prophets too.</l>
                  <l>Enter in at the strait Gate, for the Road</l>
                  <l>That doth unto Destruction lead is broad,</l>
                  <l>And wide the Gate, and many there be that</l>
                  <l>Enter therein: because strait is the Gate,</l>
                  <l>And narrow is the way that is inclin'd</l>

                  <l>False Prophets shun, who in Sheeps Cloaths appear,</l>
                  <l>But inwardly devouring Wolves they are:</l>
                  <l>Ye by their Fruits shall know them. Do Men either</l>
                  <l>Pluck Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thistles gather?</l>
                  <l>Even so each good Tree good Fruit will produce;</l>
                  <l>But a corrupt Tree Fruit unfit for use:</l>
                  <l>A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Food,</l>
                  <l>Nor can an evil Tree bear Fruit that's good:</l>
                  <l>Each Tree that bears not good Fruit's hewen down</l>
                  <l>And burnt; thus by their Fruits they shall be known.</l>

Not every one that saith Lord, Lord, but he</l>
                  <l>That doth my Heav'nly Father's Will, shall be</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>NOW unto <hi>Jonah,</hi> old <hi>Amittai</hi>'s Son,</l>
                  <l>Thus did the Word of the Almighty come,</l>
                  <l>And said, Arise; Go thou forthwith &amp; cry</l>
                  <l>'Gainst that great City <hi>Nineveh;</hi> for why,</l>
                  <l>The Sins thereof are come up in my sight.</l>
                  <l>But he arose, that he to <hi>Tarshish</hi> might</l>
                  <l>Flee from God's Presence; and went down &amp; found</l>
                  <l>A Ship at <hi>Joppa</hi> unto <hi>Tarshish</hi> bound:</l>
                  <l>He paid the Fare, and with them went on board</l>
                  <l>For <hi>Tarshish,</hi> from the Presence of the Lord.</l>
                  <l>But the Almighty a great Wind did raise,</l>
                  <l>And sent a mighty Tempest on the Seas,</l>
                  <l>So that the Ship was likely to be broken.</l>
                  <l>Then were the Mariners with Horror strucken;</l>
                  <l>And to his God they cried ev'ry one;</l>
                  <l>And over-board was the Ships lading thrown</l>
                  <l>To lighten it: but down into the Ship</l>
                  <l>Was <hi>Jonah</hi> gone, and there lay fast asleep.</l>
                  <l>So to him came the Master and did say,</l>
                  <l>What meanest thou, O Sleeper! Rise and pray</l>
                  <l>Unto thy God, and he perhaps will hear,</l>
                  <l>And save us from the danger that we fear.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:41966:21"/>
Then said they to each other, come, let's try,</l>
                  <l>By casting Lots, on whom the Fault doth lie,</l>
                  <l>In bringing all this evil now upon us.</l>
                  <l>So they cast Lots, and the Lot fell on <hi>Jonas.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Then said they, we intreat thee let us know,</l>
                  <l>For whose cause we this evil undergo,</l>
                  <l>Whence comest thou? What is thine Occupation?</l>
                  <l>What Country-man art thou? And of what Nation?</l>
                  <l>And unto them himself he did deolare,</l>
                  <l>And said, I am an <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and do fear</l>
                  <l>The Living Lord, the God of Heaven, who</l>
                  <l>Alone hath made the Sea and dry Land too.</l>
                  <l>Then were the Men exceedingly afraid;</l>
                  <l>And, wherefore hast thou done this thing? they said</l>
                  <l>(For they did understand he did forgo</l>
                  <l>God's Presence, for himself had told them so.)</l>
                  <l>What shall we do unto thee then they said,</l>
                  <l>That so the raging of the Sea be stay'd?</l>
                  <l>(For it did rage and foam.) Take me, said he,</l>
                  <l>And cast me over board into the Sea;</l>
                  <l>So shall the Sea be calm, for on my score</l>
                  <l>I know it is, that thus the Waves do roar.</l>
                  <l>Nevertheless they rowed hard to gain</l>
                  <l>The Land, but all their labour was in vain;</l>
                  <l>So much against them did the Tempest beat.</l>
                  <l>Wherefore they the Almighty did entreat,</l>
                  <l>And said, we do beseech thee, and we pray,</l>
                  <l>O Lord, that thou would'st not upon us lay</l>
                  <l>The charge of guiltless Blood, nor let it be,</l>
                  <l>That now we perish, on th'account that we</l>
                  <l>Take this Man's Life away; for thou alone,</l>
                  <l>As it hath pleased thee, O Lord, hast done.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:41966:21"/>
So they took <hi>Jonah</hi> up, and to the Seas</l>
                  <l>Committed him, then did the Tempest cease.</l>
                  <l>Then did the Dread of the Great God on high,</l>
                  <l>Seize on the Mariners exceedingly.</l>
                  <l>And they did offer up a Sacrifice,</l>
                  <l>And vowed Vows unto the Lord likewise.</l>
                  <l>And now the Lord for <hi>Jonah</hi> did contrive</l>
                  <l>A mighty Fish to swallow'im up alive,</l>
                  <l>And in the Fish's Belly for the space</l>
                  <l>Of three days and three nights, poor <hi>Jonah</hi> was.</l>

                  <l>UNto the Lord his God then <hi>Jonah</hi> pray'd</l>
                  <l>Out of the Belly of the Fish, and said,</l>
                  <l>By reason of Affliction which lay sore</l>
                  <l>Upon me, I the Lord God did implore,</l>
                  <l>And he gave Ear; and from Hell's Belly I</l>
                  <l>Cry'd unto thee, and thou, Lord, heard'st my Cry;</l>
                  <l>For thou into the Deep hadst cast me out,</l>
                  <l>And there the Floods did compass me about,</l>
                  <l>In the midst of the Sea, thy Waves were sent,</l>
                  <l>And all thy Billows which my Head o'er went.</l>
                  <l>Then said I though thy Presence hath forsook</l>
                  <l>Me, to thy Holy Temple will I look.</l>
                  <l>The Waters compassed about my Soul,</l>
                  <l>And the great Deeps did round about me rowl,</l>
                  <l>The Weeds were wrapt about my Head, I went</l>
                  <l>Down to the bottom of the Element;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:41966:22"/>
The Earth with her strong Bars surrounded me,</l>
                  <l>Yet thou, O Lord, from Death hast set me free.</l>
                  <l>When my Soul fainted, on the Lord I thought,</l>
                  <l>And to thee to thy Temple then was brought</l>
                  <l>My Pray'r. They their own Mercies do despise,</l>
                  <l>Who have regard to lying Vanities.</l>
                  <l>But with the Voice of my Thanksgiving, I</l>
                  <l>Will offer Sacrifice to thee on high,</l>
                  <l>And pay my Vows which I have vow'd each one,</l>
                  <l>For why? Salvation's of the Lord alone.</l>
                  <l>And now the Fish, as God did give Command,</l>
                  <l>Did vomit <hi>Jonah</hi> out upon dry Land.</l>

                  <l>AND now the Second time to <hi>Jonah</hi> came</l>
                  <l>God's Word, and said, Arise, go and proclaim</l>
                  <l>To that great City <hi>Nineveh,</hi> what I</l>
                  <l>Have heretofore commanded thee to cry.</l>
                  <l>So <hi>Jonah</hi> rose up, and prepar'd to go</l>
                  <l>To <hi>Nineveh</hi> as God had bid him do:</l>
                  <l>(Now was the City <hi>Nineveh</hi> so great,</l>
                  <l>That it was three days Journey long compleat)</l>
                  <l>And as into the City <hi>Jonah</hi> made</l>
                  <l>His first days Journey, he cry'd out, and said,</l>
                  <l>When forty days shall be expir'd and past,</l>
                  <l>This City <hi>Nineveh</hi> shall be laid waste.</l>
                  <l>Then did the Ninevites with one accord,</l>
                  <l>Believe this was the Message of the Lord,</l>

                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:41966:22"/>
And did proclaim a Fast, and every one,</l>
                  <l>From greatest to the least, put Sackcloth on:</l>
                  <l>For to the King this News was quickly flown,</l>
                  <l>And he arose, and came down from his Throne,</l>
                  <l>And having laid aside his Robes of State,</l>
                  <l>He put on Sackcloth, and in Ashes sate:</l>
                  <l>And issuing out his Royal Proclamation,</l>
                  <l>And through the City making Publication</l>
                  <l>Thereof, (being by the King and Council sign'd)</l>
                  <l>A solemn and a general Fast enjoin'd,</l>

                  <l>Nor Flock, nor Herd, shall their Provision taste:</l>
                  <l>But let them all put Sackcloth on, and cry</l>
                  <l>Unto the Lord with greatest fervency;</l>
                  <l>Yea, let them all their evil Ways refrain,</l>

                  <l>Who knows if God will yet be pleas'd to spare,</l>
                  <l>And turn away the Evil that we fear?</l>
                  <l>And God beheld their Works, and saw that they</l>
                  <l>Had turned from the Evil of their Way:</l>
                  <l>And God turn'd from his Wrath, and did revoke</l>

Of this, when I was yet at home? Therefore</l>
                  <l>I unto <hi>Tarshish</hi> took my flight before:</l>
                  <l>For that thou art a gracious God I know,</l>
                  <l>Of tender Mercy, and to Anger slow,</l>
                  <l>Of great Compassion, and dost oft recal</l>
                  <l>The Evil thou dost threat Mankind withal:</l>
                  <l>Now therefore, Lord, I earnestly do pray</l>
                  <l>That thou would'st please to take my Life away,</l>
                  <l>For I had better die than live. Dost thou</l>
                  <l>Do well, said God, to be so angry now?</l>
                  <l>So then out of the City <hi>Jonah</hi> went,</l>
                  <l>And on the East-side of it made a Tent,</l>
                  <l>And underneath the shade thereof he sate,</l>
                  <l>Expecting what would be the City's Fate:</l>
                  <l>And over <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Head behold, the Lord</l>
                  <l>Prepar'd, and caused to come up, a Gourd</l>
                  <l>To shadow him, and ease him of his Grief;</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Jonah</hi> was right glad of this Relief.</l>
                  <l>But God a Worm sent early the next day,</l>
                  <l>Which smote the Gourd, it withered away:</l>
                  <l>And when the Sun arose it came to pass,</l>
                  <l>That God a vehement East wind did raise;</l>
                  <l>Besides, the Sun did beat upon his Head,</l>
                  <l>So that he fainted, saying, would I were dead,</l>
                  <l>For it is better for me now to die,</l>
                  <l>Than thus to lead my Life in Misery.</l>
                  <l>And to distressed <hi>Jonah,</hi> said the Lord,</l>
                  <l>Dost thou well to be angry for the Gourd?</l>
                  <l>And he unto the Lord made this Reply,</l>
                  <l>I do well to be angry even to die.</l>
                  <l>Thou hast had pity, <hi>Jonah,</hi> on the Gourd,</l>
                  <l>For which thou didst not labour, said the Lord,</l>

                  <l>He by the Hand of Providence was led</l>
                  <l>To <hi>Padan-aram,</hi> in <hi>Assyria,</hi> where</l>
                  <l>He serv'd his Uncle <hi>Laban</hi> twenty year;</l>
                  <l>During which time he was in all things blest,</l>

                  <l>As <hi>Joseph</hi> was, who was his chief delight:</l>
                  <l>Who by the time that <hi>Jacob</hi> was return'd</l>
                  <l>Into the Land, where's Fathers had sojourn'd,</l>
                  <l>Was full arriv'd at seventeen years of Age;</l>
                  <l>And by his Hopefulness did then presage,</l>
                  <l>He was indued with a noble Mind,</l>
                  <l>That would to vertuous Actions be inclin'd;</l>
                  <l>For being sent to feed his Father's Flock,</l>
                  <l>Among his Brethren, he great notice took</l>
                  <l>Of what they did, and if in any sort</l>
                  <l>They did amiss, he thereof made report</l>
                  <l>Unto his Father, and did thus create</l>
                  <l>His Father's favour, but his Brethren's hate.</l>

His Father lov'd him better than the rest,</l>
                  <l>As being the Son wherewith his Age was blest:</l>
                  <l>And that his Kindness might the more appear,</l>
                  <l>Made him a party colour'd Coat to wear.</l>
                  <l>But as it often haps, his Father's Love</l>
                  <l>Did in his Brethren greater Hatred move:</l>
                  <l>But that which most incens'd them was his Dreams,</l>
                  <l>By which, in a Prophetick way, he seems</l>
                  <l>Their low Submission, and his future State</l>
                  <l>Of Greatness, plainly to Prognosticate.</l>
                  <l>For to his Brethren thus his Dreams he told,</l>
                  <l>And said, as we were binding Sheaves, behold,</l>
                  <l>My Sheaf arose and stood up in the Field,</l>
                  <l>And all your Sheaves stood round about, to yield</l>
                  <l>Obeisance unto mine: And what, must we</l>
                  <l>Indeed, say they, be subject unto thee?</l>
                  <l>Their Wrath increas'd, this added to his Crime.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Joseph</hi> dreamed yet a second time;</l>
                  <l>And said, Behold, I saw the Sun and Moon,</l>
                  <l>And the eleven Stars to me fall down</l>
                  <l>At which his Father highly was offended,</l>
                  <l>And for these words, the Lad he reprehended,</l>
                  <l>And said, fond Youth, Dost thou pretend to shew</l>
                  <l>That I, thy Mother, and thy Brethren too,</l>
                  <l>Must all submit to thee? Thou dost but dream:</l>
                  <l>But <hi>Jacob</hi> kept his words, and thought of them.</l>
                  <l>Now <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sons did feed their Flocks in <hi>Shechem,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And he desired <hi>Joseph</hi> to go seek 'em,</l>
                  <l>And find them out, and come again and tell</l>
                  <l>If all things with them and their Flocks were well.</l>
                  <l>So <hi>Joseph</hi> went, and wander'd here and there,</l>
                  <l>But could not find out where his Brethren were,</l>

Untill a Man had told him their Intent</l>
                  <l>Of going to <hi>Dothan,</hi> where he also went.</l>
                  <l>And when his Brethren at a distance saw him,</l>
                  <l>They held a Consultation how to slay him,</l>
                  <l>And said, here comes the Dreamer, we shall see</l>
                  <l>What the Event of all his Dreams will be;</l>
                  <l>For we will kill, and in a Pit will hide him,</l>
                  <l>And say some Beast or other hath destroy'd him.</l>
                  <l>But <hi>Reuben</hi> somewhat tend'rer than the rest,</l>
                  <l>Endeavour'd to perswade them to desist</l>
                  <l>From Murder, saying, Into this Pit let's cast him,</l>
                  <l>And this he said in hopes to have releas'd him.</l>
                  <l>And now when <hi>Joseph</hi> came not dreading ought,</l>
                  <l>They strip'd him of his party colour'd Coat,</l>
                  <l>And led him to a Pit that was hard by,</l>
                  <l>And threw him into't, but the Pit was dry.</l>
                  <l>And sitting down to eat, they chanc'd to spy,</l>
                  <l>A Company of Ishmaelites pass by,</l>
                  <l>Who with Balm, Myrrh, and Spice, their Camels lading,</l>
                  <l>From <hi>Gilead</hi> came, and were to <hi>Egypt</hi> Trading:</l>
                  <l>Then <hi>Judah</hi> said, 'Twill do us little good</l>
                  <l>To slay our Brother, and conceal his Blood;</l>
                  <l>Come therefore, Brethren, be advis'd by me,</l>
                  <l>Let's sell him to these Ishmaelites, for he</l>
                  <l>Is our own Flesh, and 'tis a cruel Deed,</l>
                  <l>To kill him, and to this they all agreed.</l>
                  <l>Their Brother then out of the Pit they hale,</l>
                  <l>And to these Merchants offer'd him to sale:</l>
                  <l>Who, him for twenty Silver Pieces bought,</l>
                  <l>And with them to the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> brought.</l>
                  <l>But <hi>Reuben</hi> ignorant of what was done,</l>
                  <l>Came to the Pit, and seeing the Lad was gone,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:41966:25"/>
He rent his Cloaths in a great Consternation,</l>
                  <l>Returning back with heavy Lamentation.</l>
                  <l>And now that they might make their Story good</l>
                  <l>They kill'd a Kid, and dipped in the Blood</l>
                  <l>Their Brother <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Coat, and home they came,</l>
                  <l>And to their Father's view expos'd the same,</l>
                  <l>And said, this we have found, now thou dost know</l>
                  <l>Whether it be thy Son's Coat, yea or no.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Jacob</hi> knew the Coat full well, and said,</l>
                  <l>Now hath some evil Beast devour'd the Lad;</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Joseph</hi> is torn in Pieces without doubt,</l>
                  <l>For, too, too well I know this is his Coat.</l>
                  <l>He rent his Cloaths, and putting Sackcloath on,</l>
                  <l>He for a long time mourned for his Son.</l>
                  <l>His Children striving to asswage his Grief</l>
                  <l>Endeavour'd to administer Relief:</l>

Whereof his Master being well aware,</l>
                  <l>Committed all he had to <hi>Joseph</hi>'s care;</l>
                  <l>And made him Overseer of his House,</l>
                  <l>And from the time his Master us'd him thus,</l>
                  <l>The Lord was pleas'd to give him to partake,</l>
                  <l>Of many Blessings ev'n for <hi>Joseph</hi>'s sake:</l>
                  <l>So that with Plenty he was hedg'd about,</l>
                  <l>And prospered within Door and without:</l>
                  <l>Such was his Master's Love, and he so Just,</l>
                  <l>That all things were committed to his Trust.</l>
                  <l>Now <hi>Joseph</hi> was grown up to manly Stature,</l>
                  <l>Of goodly Presence, and most comely Feature.</l>
                  <l>Wherefore his Mistress with a lustful Eye,</l>
                  <l>Beheld his Beauty, and resolv'd to try,</l>
                  <l>If to unchaste Embraces she could gain</l>
                  <l>The Youth, but her Endeavours prov'd in vain:</l>
                  <l>For he refus'd, and said, My Master knows</l>
                  <l>In all the House of nothing that he owes,</l>
                  <l>For his Concerns are all at my dispose:</l>
                  <l>There's not a thing that he hath kept from me,</l>
                  <l>But all is in my hand save only thee;</l>
                  <l>Then how can I commit so foul a Fact,</l>
                  <l>And the Displeasure of my God contract?</l>
                  <l>Yet still she sued, and still did he deny her,</l>
                  <l>Refusing to be with her, or lie by her.</l>
                  <l>Now on a time when all the Men were gone</l>
                  <l>Out of the House and she was left alone:</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Joseph</hi> at that Instant coming in,</l>
                  <l>About some Business he'd to do within;</l>
                  <l>She took Advantage of their being together,</l>

But <hi>Joseph</hi> strove, and from her hands got loose,</l>
                  <l>And left his Coat, and fled out of the House.</l>
                  <l>And when she saw that he had made's Escape,</l>
                  <l>She call'd her Servants, and proclaim'd a Rape:</l>
                  <l>Come see now how this Hebrew Slave, said she,</l>
                  <l>Your Master's Favourite, hath affronted me;</l>
                  <l>He came to violate my Chastity,</l>
                  <l>And when he heard that I began to cry,</l>
                  <l>And call for help, afraid least you should find him,</l>
                  <l>He's fled, and left his Garment here behind him.</l>
                  <l>And now to give her words the greater credit,</l>
                  <l>Untill her Husband's coming home, she hid it,</l>
                  <l>To whom she spake, and said, Why hast thou brought</l>
                  <l>This Hebrew here, to set me thus at nought?</l>
                  <l>The Slave attempted to defile my bed,</l>
                  <l>And when I cry'd, he left his Coat and fled,</l>
                  <l>See here it is. Which when he saw, and heard</l>
                  <l>The heavy Accusation she preferr'd,</l>
                  <l>He was exceeding wroth at his Behaviour,</l>
                  <l>And utterly casheir'd him from his Favour;</l>
                  <l>Nay more, he cast him into Prison, where</l>
                  <l>In Fetters bound King <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Prisoner's were.</l>
                  <l>But <hi>Joseph</hi>'s God, who never yet forsook</l>
                  <l>Him in Extremity, was pleas'd to look,</l>
                  <l>With great Compassion on his Injuries,</l>
                  <l>And gave him Favour in the Keeper's eyes;</l>
                  <l>So that he was intrusted with the care</l>
                  <l>And charge of all the Pris'ners that were there:</l>
                  <l>All were committed unto <hi>Joseph</hi>'s hand,</l>
                  <l>And what was done, was done at his command,</l>
                  <l>The Prison-keeper took no care at all.</l>

                  <l>It came to pass upon a certain day,</l>
                  <l>That <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> being wroth</l>
                  <l>With his chief Butler, and chief Baker both,</l>
                  <l>For their Offences, put them both in Ward,</l>
                  <l>In the House of the Captain of the Guard:</l>
                  <l>Into the Place where <hi>Joseph</hi> was confin'd,</l>
                  <l>Unto whose Custody they were resign'd,</l>
                  <l>And he attended on them in the Prison.</l>
                  <l>And there they were continu'd for a season,</l>
                  <l>During which time, it chanced both of them</l>
                  <l>Did in the same Night dream each Man his Dream:</l>
                  <l>Which Dreams according to Interpretation,</l>
                  <l>Had to themselves particular Relation.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Joseph</hi> coming early the next day,</l>
                  <l>Into the Room where <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Servants lay,</l>
                  <l>Beheld their Countenances much dejected:</l>
                  <l>Wherefore he said. What Evil hath effected</l>
                  <l>This melancholy Frame, what is't that causes</l>
                  <l>These marks of Discontentment in your Faces?</l>
                  <l>Then said they, we have dream'd each Man his Dream,</l>
                  <l>And there is no Man to interpret them.</l>
                  <l>Then <hi>Joseph</hi> said your Dreams to me make known;</l>
                  <l>Interpretations are from God alone.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:41966:27"/>
Then unto <hi>Joseph</hi> the chief Butler told</l>
                  <l>His Dream, and said, Methought I did behold</l>
                  <l>A Vine, whereon three Branches did appear,</l>
                  <l>Which seem'd to bud, to blossom, and to bear</l>
                  <l>Clusters of full ripe Grapes, which to my thinking</l>
                  <l>I press'd into the Cup for <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s drinking.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Joseph</hi> said, Thy Dream doth signifie,</l>
                  <l>Thou shalt enjoy thy former Dignity:</l>
                  <l>The Branches which thou sawest are three days,</l>
                  <l>In which King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> will his Butler raise,</l>
                  <l>And to thy Place again wil thee restore,</l>
                  <l>And thou shalt serve him as thou'st done before:</l>
                  <l>But do not, when it shall be well with thee,</l>
                  <l>Forget me, but shew Kindness unto me,</l>
                  <l>And unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> represent my Case,</l>
                  <l>That I may be deliver'd from this Place,</l>
                  <l>For I was stoln out of the Hebrews Land,</l>
                  <l>And also here am wrongfully detain'd.</l>
                  <l>Then the chief Baker having understood,</l>
                  <l>That the Interpretation was so good,</l>
                  <l>He told his Dream to <hi>Joseph</hi> too, and said,</l>
                  <l>Lo, I had three white Baskets on my Head,</l>
                  <l>And in the Uppermost there seem'd to be,</l>
                  <l>Of bak'd Provision, great variety,</l>
                  <l>Fit for King <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Table, and there came</l>
                  <l>A Flock of Birds, and seem'd to eat the same.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Joseph</hi> said, Thy Dream portends thy fall,</l>
                  <l>For at the end of three days <hi>Pharaoh</hi> shall</l>
                  <l>Lift up thy Head, and hang thee on a Tree,</l>
                  <l>So that the Birds shall feast themselves on thee.</l>
                  <l>And on the third day <hi>Pharaoh</hi> made a Feast</l>
                  <l>Unto his Servants, and among the rest</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:41966:28"/>
The Butler and the Baker were brought forth,</l>
                  <l>The day being kept in Memory of his Birth:</l>
                  <l>And to his Place King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did restore</l>
                  <l>His Butler, and he serv'd him as before.</l>
                  <l>But the chief Baker he condemn'd to die,</l>
                  <l>According unto <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Prophecy.</l>
                  <l>Yet though the Butler had regain'd his Place,</l>
                  <l>He was unmindful of poor <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Case.</l>

                  <l>AND now when two years time was fully past,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Joseph</hi> from Confinement not releast,</l>
                  <l>It came to pass that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> dreamed, and</l>
                  <l>He seemed by a River's side to stand,</l>
                  <l>Whence, he seven fat well-favour'd Kine beheld,</l>
                  <l>Came up and grazed in the neighbouring Field.</l>
                  <l>And after them there came up seven more</l>
                  <l>Lean and ill-favour'd, and did soon devour</l>
                  <l>The seven fat Kine which came up just before.</l>
                  <l>So <hi>Pharaoh</hi> 'woke, and mus'd awhile, and then</l>
                  <l>Soon as his Sleep his Dream return'd agen.</l>
                  <l>Wherein he saw upon one stalk there stood</l>
                  <l>Seven ears of Corn, exceeding Rank and Good,</l>
                  <l>And seven others, with the East wind blasted,</l>
                  <l>And withered, sprang up, and quickly wasted</l>
                  <l>The seven good Ears, and quite devour'd them:</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> 'woke, and, Lo! it was a Dream.</l>

And in the Morning he was discontent,</l>
                  <l>And for the wise Men, and Magicians sent,</l>
                  <l>To ease his Mind but there was none of them</l>
                  <l>That could interpret to the King his Dream.</l>
                  <l>Then the chief Butler making his address.</l>
                  <l>Unto King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> said, I now confess</l>
                  <l>My former Faults, for when the King was wroth</l>
                  <l>With his chief Butler, and chief Baker both,</l>
                  <l>It pleased him, to put us both in Ward,</l>
                  <l>In the House of the Captain of the Guard:</l>
                  <l>And in one Night we dream'd a Dream, each one</l>
                  <l>According to's Interpretation;</l>
                  <l>And there was then an Hebrew there in Ward,</l>
                  <l>A Youth, that serv'd the Captain of the Guard:</l>
                  <l>To whom we told whereof we had been dreaming,</l>
                  <l>And he interpreted to us the meaning,</l>
                  <l>And what he said fell out accordingly,</l>
                  <l>Me he restored to my Dignity,</l>
                  <l>But told the Baker he should surely die.</l>
                  <l>Then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> sent a Messenger in haste,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Joseph</hi> from the Dungeon was releast:</l>
                  <l>And having shav'd himself, and chang'd his Cloaths,</l>
                  <l>Into the Presence of the King he goes.</l>
                  <l>To whom King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said, I have been told</l>
                  <l>Thou canst the meaning of a Dream unfold:</l>
                  <l>Now I have dream'd a Dream, and there is none</l>
                  <l>Can give me the Interpretation.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Joseph</hi> said, I cannot do this thing</l>
                  <l>My self, but God shall answer thee, Oh, King.</l>
                  <l>Then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said to <hi>Joseph,</hi> In my Dream,</l>
                  <l>As I stood by a River's side, there came</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:41966:29"/>
Up from the River seven well-favour'd Kine,</l>
                  <l>And fed upon the Banks, all fat and fine,</l>
                  <l>And after them there came up seven more,</l>
                  <l>Lean and ill-favour'd, and exceeding poor:</l>
                  <l>Such as the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> never bred,</l>
                  <l>And on the seven well-favour'd Kine they fed,</l>
                  <l>And eat them up, but 'twas not to be seen</l>
                  <l>That they had eat them, they look'd still so thin.</l>
                  <l>So I awoke, and mus'd a while, and then</l>
                  <l>Soon as my Sleep, my Dream return'd agen,</l>
                  <l>Wherein I saw upon one stalk there stood</l>
                  <l>Seven Ears of Corn, exceeding rank, and good:</l>
                  <l>Then seven others, with the East wind blasted,</l>
                  <l>And withered, came up, and quickly wasted</l>
                  <l>The seven good Ears, and quite devoured them.</l>
                  <l>And being unsatisfied about my Dream,</l>
                  <l>I sought unto the wise Men of the Nation,</l>
                  <l>But they could give me no Interpretation.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Joseph</hi> said, Thy Dream, oh King! is one,</l>
                  <l>God shews to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> what he will have done.</l>
                  <l>The seven fat Kine, and seven good Ears agree</l>
                  <l>To shew, seven years of Plenty there shall be:</l>
                  <l>The seven lean Kine, and seven blasted Ears,</l>
                  <l>Denote there shall be Famine seven years.</l>
                  <l>This I declare to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> God doth shew</l>
                  <l>To thee, Oh King! what he's about to do.</l>
                  <l>Behold seven years of Plenty are at hand,</l>
                  <l>Which shall be very great throughout the Land:</l>
                  <l>And after them seven years of Famine shall</l>
                  <l>Arise, and shall consume the Land, and all</l>
                  <l>The former Plenty shall not be perceiv'd,</l>
                  <l>So much the Land with Famine shall be griev'd.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:41966:29"/>
And since the Dream was doubl'd to the King,</l>
                  <l>It is because God hath decreed the thing,</l>
                  <l>And on this Land the same will shortly bring:</l>
                  <l>Now therefore if I may the King advise,</l>
                  <l>Let him look out a Man discreet and wise,</l>
                  <l>And make him Overseer of the Land;</l>
                  <l>And substitute Men under his Command</l>
                  <l>To gather a fifth part for Publick Use,</l>
                  <l>Of what the seven plenteous Years produce,</l>
                  <l>And in the Cities lay it up for Store,</l>
                  <l>Against the Famine in the Land grows sore;</l>
                  <l>And let it be repos'd in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s hand,</l>
                  <l>That so the Famine may not wast the Land.</l>
                  <l>And when King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Servants heard</l>
                  <l>The Propositions <hi>Joseph</hi> had preferr'd,</l>
                  <l>They were acceptable in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Eyes,</l>
                  <l>And in the Eyes of all his Court likewise:</l>
                  <l>So that he said, can such an one be found?</l>
                  <l>A Man in whom God's Spirit doth abound.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said to <hi>Joseph,</hi> forasmuch</l>
                  <l>As God's great kindness unto thee is such,</l>
                  <l>As to reveal this thing to thee, I know</l>
                  <l>No Man so wise or so discreet as thou:</l>
                  <l>Be thou therefore the Ruler of the Land,</l>
                  <l>And let my People be at thy Command;</l>
                  <l>Thou shalt in all things be as great as I,</l>
                  <l>Save only in the Royal Dignity.</l>
                  <l>Behold this day I have advanced thee</l>
                  <l>Said he, to be a Man of high Degree</l>
                  <l>Throughout the Land. And therewithal the King</l>
                  <l>Bestow'd on <hi>Joseph</hi> his own Royal Ring;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:41966:30"/>
And him with Robes of State did richly deck,</l>
                  <l>And put a Chain of Gold about his Neck,</l>
                  <l>And in his second Chariot made him ride,</l>
                  <l>And as he past, bow down the Knee they cry'd,</l>
                  <l>With so great Honour was he dignify'd.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said moreover, I am King,</l>
                  <l>No Man shall dare to purpose any thing,</l>
                  <l>Or move his Hand or Foot in all this Nation,</l>
                  <l>Unless it shall be by thy approbation.</l>
                  <l>He also gave to <hi>Joseph</hi> a new Name,</l>
                  <l>And for a Wife gave him a Princely Dame,</l>
                  <l>Who was the Daughter of a Priest of Fame.</l>
                  <l>(Now <hi>Joseph</hi> had attain'd his Thirtieth Year,</l>
                  <l>When he before King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did appear.)</l>
                  <l>And he went out from <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Presence, and</l>
                  <l>Began his Progress over all the Land.</l>
                  <l>Now in the seven plenteous Years, the Field</l>
                  <l>Did its Increase in great abundance yield.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Joseph</hi> gather'd all that plenteous Crop,</l>
                  <l>And in th' adjacent Cities laid it up:</l>
                  <l>Which like unto the Sand upon the shore,</l>
                  <l>Did so abound that he could count no more,</l>
                  <l>Such was the Plenty that the Earth then bore.</l>
                  <l>And unto <hi>Joseph</hi> there was born a Son,</l>
                  <l>Even by the Daughter of the Priest of <hi>On,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Before the Years of Famine were begun,</l>
                  <l>The which he call'd <hi>Manasseh,</hi> for, said he,</l>
                  <l>God makes me to forget my Misery,</l>
                  <l>And all my Father's House: And after him</l>
                  <l>Was born another he call'd <hi>Ephraim;</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>For God, saith he, hath made me to possess</l>
                  <l>Abundance in the Land of my Distress.</l>

And when the seven plenteous Years were gone,</l>
                  <l>The seven Years of Famine next came on,</l>
                  <l>As <hi>Joseph</hi> said, and there was a great Dearth</l>
                  <l>In every Nation throughout all the Earth;</l>
                  <l>But in the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> there was Bread.</l>
                  <l>And when the People, almost famished,</l>
                  <l>Complained to the King, he bad them go</l>
                  <l>To <hi>Joseph,</hi> and whate'er he said to do.</l>
                  <l>And now the Famine daily waxing sore,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Joseph</hi> began to bring forth of his Store,</l>
                  <l>Which he had laid up for the Publick Good;</l>
                  <l>To whom th' <hi>Egyptians</hi> came and bought their Food.</l>
                  <l>And People from all Countries far and near</l>
                  <l>To <hi>Egypt</hi> came to buy Provision there;</l>
                  <l>For in all Lands the Famine was severe.</l>

                  <l>AND now, behold, when <hi>Jacob</hi> had been told</l>
                  <l>That there was Corn in <hi>Egypt</hi> to be sold,</l>
                  <l>He said unto his Sons, Why stand ye thus?</l>
                  <l>Go down to <hi>Egypt</hi> and buy Corn for us;</l>
                  <l>That so our craving Stomachs may be fed,</l>
                  <l>And not lie here and die for lack of Bread.</l>
                  <l>Thus <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ten Sons were to <hi>Egypt</hi> sent,</l>
                  <l>But <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Brother <hi>Benjamin</hi> ne'er went;</l>

                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:41966:31"/>
For why, his Father said, I will not send him,</l>
                  <l>Lest peradventure some ill chance attend him.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Brethren came among the rest</l>
                  <l>To buy Provision, for they were distrest.</l>
                  <l>Now he was Governor of all the Land,</l>
                  <l>And all the Corn of <hi>Egypt</hi> in his hand.</l>
                  <l>Wherefore his Brethren when they came to treat</l>
                  <l>With him for Corn, bow'd down ev'n at his feet:</l>
                  <l>And he no sooner saw them but he knew them,</l>
                  <l>And shew'd himself extremely strange unto them:</l>
                  <l>And very roughly asked who they were,</l>
                  <l>From whence they came and what their bus'ness there</l>
                  <l>And they made answer, We thy Servants from</l>
                  <l>The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to buy Food are come.</l>
                  <l>Now tho' they knew him not, yet he knew them,</l>
                  <l>And calling now to mind his former Dream,</l>
                  <l>He said, I do suspect ye're come as Spies,</l>
                  <l>To see in what distress our Country lies.</l>
                  <l>But they reply'd again, my Lord we're come</l>
                  <l>Only to buy some Food to carry home:</l>
                  <l>Think not thy Servants Spies, but true Men rather,</l>
                  <l>For we are all the Children of one Father.</l>
                  <l>Nay, nay, said he, but ye are come to pry</l>
                  <l>Into the Nations great necessity.</l>
                  <l>But they reply'd again, Thy Servants are</l>
                  <l>Inhabitants of <hi>Cana'n,</hi> and declare,</l>
                  <l>That we're twelve Brethren whom one Man begot,</l>
                  <l>The Youngest is at home and one is not.</l>
                  <l>Well then, said <hi>Joseph,</hi> hereby shall I know,</l>
                  <l>Whether ye're Spies, as I have said, or no;</l>
                  <l>Now by the Life of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> do I swear,</l>
                  <l>Unless your Brother come I'll keep you here:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:41966:31"/>
Send one of you and fetch the Lad to me,</l>
                  <l>And you shall be confin'd, so shall there be</l>
                  <l>A Proof of what you say before mine Eyes,</l>
                  <l>Or by the Life of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ye are Spies.</l>
                  <l>Then he for three days put them all in Ward,</l>
                  <l>And on the third day said I have regard</l>
                  <l>To Equity, therefore if ye are true</l>
                  <l>And honest Men, do this; let one of you</l>
                  <l>Be bound in Prison here, and let the other</l>
                  <l>Go carry Corn home and bring me your Brother;</l>
                  <l>So shall ye be approv'd and shall not die.</l>
                  <l>And they prepar'd to do accordingly.</l>
                  <l>And as they were discoursing to each other,</l>
                  <l>They said, we were in fault about our Brother,</l>
                  <l>In that we saw his Soul in great distress,</l>
                  <l>And yet were so exceeding pitiless,</l>
                  <l>As not to hearken to his earnest cries:</l>
                  <l>This is the cause of these our Miseries.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Reuben</hi> said, you know I did forewarn,</l>
                  <l>And beg that you would do the Child no harm;</l>
                  <l>But you would not do then as I desir'd,</l>
                  <l>And now his Blood is at our hands requir'd.</l>
                  <l>Thus they discours'd about the cause that brought</l>
                  <l>Their present trouble, but they little thought</l>
                  <l>That <hi>Joseph</hi> knew of what they did confer,</l>
                  <l>Because he spake by an Interpreter.</l>
                  <l>And he being moved at their words withdrew</l>
                  <l>To weep, and then returned to renew</l>
                  <l>His former talk; and chusing <hi>Simeon</hi> out,</l>
                  <l>Before them all he bound him hand and foot.</l>
                  <l>And gave command to fill their Sacks with Grain,</l>
                  <l>And to restore their Mony to'em again;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:41966:32"/>
And for their Journey give them Food to eat:</l>
                  <l>In such sort <hi>Joseph</hi> did his Brethren treat.</l>
                  <l>Then with their Asses laden towards home</l>
                  <l>They went, and when into their Inn they come,</l>
                  <l>As one of them his Sack of Corn unty'd,</l>
                  <l>To give his Ass some Provender, he spy'd</l>
                  <l>His Mony in his Sack again return'd;</l>
                  <l>Wherefore he call'd his Brethren and inform'd</l>
                  <l>Them that his Mony was returned back,</l>
                  <l>Behold, said he, it is here in my Sack.</l>
                  <l>On sight whereof their Hearts were sore dismay'd,</l>
                  <l>And being very much affrighted said,</l>
                  <l>What is the thing that God's about to do,</l>
                  <l>That we do thus these Troubles undergo?</l>
                  <l>Then coming to their Father they related,</l>
                  <l>After what sort they were in <hi>Egypt</hi> treated:</l>
                  <l>And said, the Man that's Lord of all the Land,</l>
                  <l>And hath the store of Corn all in his hand,</l>
                  <l>Spake roughly to us, and affirm'd that we</l>
                  <l>Were come the weakness of the Land to see.</l>
                  <l>To whom we said, we are all honest Men;</l>
                  <l>We are twelve Brethren, whereof here are ten,</l>
                  <l>And two elsewhere, all which one Man begot,</l>
                  <l>The youngest's with our Father, one is not.</l>
                  <l>Then said the Ruler of the Land, hereby</l>
                  <l>Shall I make proof of your integrity:</l>
                  <l>Let one of you continue here with me,</l>
                  <l>And take Provision for your Family;</l>
                  <l>And get you gone and bring the youngest hither,</l>
                  <l>That so I may be satisfied whether</l>
                  <l>Ye are true Men, as you make protestation,</l>
                  <l>Then I'll release him, and give toleration</l>
                  <l>To you to come and Traffick in the Nation</l>

                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:41966:32"/>
And now behold, as they their Sacks unloos'd</l>
                  <l>To empty out their Corn, there was inclos'd</l>
                  <l>In each Man's Sack his Money therein bound,</l>
                  <l>As when they came from home; which when they found,</l>
                  <l>Both they and their old Father were afraid;</l>
                  <l>And to his Sons afflicted <hi>Jacob</hi> said,</l>

                  <l>And of my <hi>Benjamin</hi> you would deprive me,</l>
                  <l>These things do ev'n into distraction drive me.</l>
                  <l>Then <hi>Reuben</hi> said, My Father I resign</l>
                  <l>To thy disposing these two Sons of mine;</l>
                  <l>Give me the Lad, and let them both be slain,</l>
                  <l>If I do not return him safe again.</l>
                  <l>But he reply'd, I will not let him go,</l>
                  <l>For why, his Brother is deceas'd you know,</l>
                  <l>And if upon the way some evil thing</l>
                  <l>Should happen to the I ad, you then will bring</l>
                  <l>These my grey Hairs with sorrow to the Grave,</l>
                  <l>For he's the only comfort that I have.</l>

                  <l>And having spent all their late purchas'd store,</l>
                  <l>Their Father bids them to go down for more</l>

                  <l>He said, The Man did solemnly protest,</l>

If we without our Brother came again,</l>
                  <l>To seek his Face would be for us in vain:</l>
                  <l>If therefore thou wilt send him, well and good,</l>

                  <l>We are resolved that we will not go:</l>
                  <l>For, as I said before, the Ruler swore,</l>
                  <l>Without him we should see his Face no more.</l>
                  <l>Then <hi>Isr'el</hi> said, why were you so unkind</l>
                  <l>To say you had a Brother left behind?</l>
                  <l>The Man, said they, was so inquisitive,</l>
                  <l>He asked if our Father were alive;</l>
                  <l>Or if we had a Brother, whereunto</l>
                  <l>Accordingly we answer'd, could we know</l>
                  <l>If he would bid us bring the Lad or no?</l>
                  <l>Moreover <hi>Judah</hi> to his Father said,</l>
                  <l>If thou wilt but intrust me with the Lad,</l>
                  <l>We will be gone, that so both thou and we</l>
                  <l>May be preserved with our Family:</l>
                  <l>I will be Surety for him, if I fail</l>

                  <l>For if we had not lingred, we had been</l>
                  <l>By this time here the second time again.</l>
                  <l>Well then, said <hi>Isr'el,</hi> if it must be so,</l>
                  <l>My Sons, take my Advice before you go;</l>
                  <l>Provide some of the best Fruits of the Land,</l>
                  <l>To give the Man a present from your hand;</l>
                  <l>Balm, Myrrh and Spices, and a little Honey,</l>
                  <l>Some Nuts and Almonds, and take double Money.</l>
                  <l>For peradventure it was a mistake,</l>
                  <l>In that your Money was returned back;</l>

                  <l>They took their Money double in their hand,</l>

                  <l>To take occasion now to fall upon us,</l>
                  <l>And make us Slaves and take our Asses from us.</l>
                  <l>Unto the Steward they drew nigh therefore,</l>
                  <l>And thus communed with him at the Door:</l>
                  <l>O Sir, say they, we came at first indeed</l>
                  <l>To buy Provision to supply our need;</l>
                  <l>And in our Inn as we our Sacks unloos'd,</l>

                  <l>In its full weight, whereat surpris'd with fear,</l>
                  <l>Not knowing who had put our Money there,</l>
                  <l>We now have brought it in full weight again,</l>
                  <l>And other Money too, to buy more Grain.</l>
                  <l>Peace, Peace, said he, let not fear seize upon ye,</l>
                  <l>For I had the disposing of your Money:</l>

                  <l>To have their Company with him to Dine.</l>
                  <l>And now when <hi>Joseph</hi> was returned home,</l>
                  <l>Into his Presence they with rev'rence come,</l>
                  <l>And brought their Presents in and laid before him,</l>
                  <l>And fell down at his Feet for to adore him.</l>
                  <l>Then he enquired if they all were well,</l>
                  <l>And said, When you were here I heard you tell</l>
                  <l>Of an old Man your Father, how does he?</l>
                  <l>Is he in Health, or doth he cease to be?</l>
                  <l>Whereto in humble sort they thus reply'd,</l>
                  <l>Thy Servant, ev'n our Father, doth abide</l>
                  <l>In perfect Health, which having said,</l>
                  <l>They bow'd their Heads and great obeysance made.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Joseph</hi> viewing <hi>Benjamin</hi> his Brother</l>
                  <l>(They being both the Children of one Mother)</l>
                  <l>He asked if he were the Lad of whom</l>
                  <l>They spake, then said, God give thee Grace my Son,</l>
                  <l>Then making hast to find a secret place</l>
                  <l>To weep, because his Bowels yern'd apace</l>
                  <l>Upon his Brother, to his Chamber went,</l>
                  <l>Where having giv'n his troubled Spirits vent,</l>
                  <l>He wash'd his Face and did himself refrain,</l>
                  <l>And to his Brethren then came sorth again.</l>

And bad his Servants they should set on Bread:</l>
                  <l>At his command the Tables all were spread;</l>
                  <l>One for himself, and for his Friends another,</l>
                  <l>And for th' <hi>Egyptians</hi> one apart from either,</l>
                  <l>That so they might not eat Bread altogether;</l>
                  <l>For it is held a great abomination</l>
                  <l>For them to eat among the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Nation.</l>
                  <l>And they were placed as their age required,</l>
                  <l>The Eldest first, whereat the Men admired:</l>
                  <l>And from his Table <hi>Joseph</hi> sent them Messes,</l>
                  <l>But in a larger manner he expresses</l>
                  <l>To <hi>Benjamin</hi> his kindness, which was such,</l>
                  <l>That he appointed him five times as much</l>
                  <l>As to the rest: and they drank plenteously,</l>
                  <l>Till they were merry in his Company.</l>

                  <l>AND to his Steward <hi>Joseph</hi> spake, and said,</l>
                  <l>Give these Men Corn as much as they can lade.</l>
                  <l>And in their Sacks bind each Man's Money up,</l>
                  <l>And in the Youngest's put my silver Cup</l>
                  <l>Besides his Money: and he made hast and did</l>
                  <l>According as his Master had commanded.</l>
                  <l>And in the morning by the break of day,</l>
                  <l>With Asses laden they were sent away:</l>
                  <l>And now, e'er they had scarce the Town's end past,</l>
                  <l>He sent his Steward after them in hast,</l>

And said, Go follow them and ask them why</l>
                  <l>They have dealt by me so ungratefully?</l>
                  <l>And say unto them, You have done great evil</l>
                  <l>To Rob my Master who hath been so civil,</l>
                  <l>And steal the Cup wherein he drinks his Wine;</l>
                  <l>Is it not it whereby he doth Divine?</l>
                  <l>Then he pursu'd and quickly overtook</l>
                  <l>Them, and these very words to them he spoke.</l>
                  <l>To whom they said, Why hath my Lord such thought?</l>
                  <l>Oh, God forbid that we should be so naught;</l>
                  <l>Behold, thou know'st we brought the Money back</l>
                  <l>The which we found bound up in each Man's Sack,</l>
                  <l>Which shews that we had no design to cheat;</l>
                  <l>How then should we now steal your Masters Plate?</l>
                  <l>With which of us thy Servants it is found</l>
                  <l>Let him be slain, and we to Slavery bound.</l>
                  <l>Now as you say, said he, so let it be,</l>
                  <l>He shall be bound, but you shall all go free.</l>
                  <l>Then they unladed ev'ry Man his Beast,</l>
                  <l>And to his view expos'd their Sacks in hast;</l>
                  <l>And he from first to last them searched round,</l>
                  <l>And lo, the Cup on <hi>Benjamin</hi> was found:</l>
                  <l>Whereat surpris'd, each Man his Garment rent,</l>
                  <l>And lades his Beast, and back again they went.</l>
                  <l>And now when <hi>Judah</hi> and the rest were come</l>
                  <l>To <hi>Joseph</hi>'s House (for he was yet at home)</l>
                  <l>They fell before him to the ground, to whom</l>
                  <l>He said, What deed is this that you have done;</l>
                  <l>Are you not sensible that such a one</l>
                  <l>As I, can certainly thereof make trial?</l>
                  <l>Then <hi>Judah</hi> said, my Lord there's no denial,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:41966:35"/>
We cannot clear our selves: The Lord hath sent,</l>
                  <l>For our mis deeds this heavy Punishment.</l>
                  <l>Behold, to be thy Slaves we all are bound,</l>
                  <l>Both we, and he on whom the Cup was sound.</l>
                  <l>Then <hi>Joseph</hi> said, the Lord forbid that I</l>
                  <l>Should exercise so great severity:</l>
                  <l>For he with whom 'tis found, and he alone</l>
                  <l>Shall be my Servant, you may all be gone.</l>
                  <l>Then unto <hi>Joseph, Judah</hi> drawing near,</l>
                  <l>Said, O my Lord! I pray be pleas'd to hear</l>
                  <l>Thy Servant speak, and be not angry now,</l>
                  <l>For as King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is ev'n so art thou.</l>
                  <l>My Lord did bid thy Servants to discover</l>
                  <l>Whether we had a Father or a Brother;</l>
                  <l>And we made answer that thy Servants had</l>
                  <l>An ancient Father and a little Lad,</l>
                  <l>The Child of his old age, who was our Brother,</l>
                  <l>And he the only Child left of his Mother,</l>
                  <l>His Brother being dead; and that this Lad</l>
                  <l>Was all the comfort that our Father had:</l>
                  <l>Then thou wert pleas'd to bid thy Servants bring</l>
                  <l>The Lad, that thou might'st have a sight of him.</l>
                  <l>And we made answer, If the Lad should leave</l>
                  <l>His Father, it would bring him to his Grave:</l>
                  <l>And thou didst then protest it was in vain</l>
                  <l>For us without him to come here again.</l>
                  <l>Then towards home thy Servants went their way,</l>
                  <l>And told our Father what my Lord did say:</l>
                  <l>And in a while when all our Corn was spent,</l>
                  <l>Thy Servant, ev'n our Father would have sent</l>
                  <l>To buy more Food; to whom thy Servants said,</l>
                  <l>We cannot go except thou send the Lad:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:41966:36"/>
Because the Man did solemnly declare,</l>
                  <l>Unless we brought him we should not come there.</l>
                  <l>And then thy Servant, ev'n our Father said,</l>
                  <l>Ye know that by my Wife two Sons I had,</l>
                  <l>And one of them went forth and came no more,</l>
                  <l>Which made me think some Beast did him devour,</l>
                  <l>And if I now should also condescend</l>
                  <l>To let this go, and mischief should attend,</l>
                  <l>You will with sorrow bring me to my end.</l>
                  <l>When to my Father I shall come therefore,</l>
                  <l>And he shall see that I do not restore</l>
                  <l>The Lad again, he certainly will die,</l>
                  <l>(Since in his Life my Father's Life doth lie)</l>
                  <l>And we shall bring him to his Grave thereby.</l>
                  <l>For I became a Surety for the Lad</l>
                  <l>Unto my Father, unto whom I said,</l>
                  <l>If I do not in safety him deliver,</l>
                  <l>Then let me bear the blame to thee for ever.</l>
                  <l>I humbly pray thee therefore to accept</l>
                  <l>Me in his stead, and let me here be kept</l>
                  <l>My Lord's Bondslave, and let the Lad go free:</l>
                  <l>For how can I, thy Servant bear to see</l>
                  <l>The Evil that shall on my Father come,</l>
                  <l>If that the Lad return not safely home.</l>

                  <l>To <hi>Egypt,</hi> be not grieved now therefore,</l>
                  <l>Nor vex your selves, for God sent me before</l>
                  <l>To save Life; for for these two Years there hath been</l>

                  <l>A Place, and strangely save your Lives beside.</l>
                  <l>So now ye sent me not, but it was rather</l>
                  <l>The Lord, and he hath made me as a Father</l>
                  <l>Unto the King, Lord of his Houshold, and</l>
                  <l>A Ruler over all this spacious Land.</l>
                  <l>Unto my Father therefore go your way,</l>

The Lord hath rais'd me to an high degree</l>
                  <l>In <hi>Egypt,</hi> tarry not but come to me,</l>
                  <l>And thou shalt dwell in <hi>Goshen</hi> and be nigh me,</l>

                  <l>And now whilst they discoursed, the Report</l>

                  <l>And fetch your Father and your Housholds, and</l>
                  <l>I'll feed you with the good things of the Land.</l>
                  <l>And since you are commanded by the King,</l>
                  <l>Take Waggons with you hence wherein to bring</l>
                  <l>Your Wives, your Little ones, and come down hither,</l>
                  <l>Your Father, you and yours altogether;</l>
                  <l>And never heed to bring your Houshold-stuff,</l>

Of Necessaries for their Journey, sent</l>
                  <l>Waggons according to the King's intent.</l>
                  <l>And to each Man he gave a Suit of Cloaths,</l>
                  <l>But on his Brother <hi>Benjamin</hi> bestows</l>
                  <l>Five Suits, and as a Token of his Love,</l>
                  <l>A Sum of Money over and above.</l>
                  <l>And thus he sent ev'n for his Father's use,</l>
                  <l>Of the best things that <hi>Egypt</hi> did produce,</l>
                  <l>Ten Asses load, and ten she-Asses load</l>
                  <l>Of Bread and Meat, to spend upon the Road.</l>
                  <l>Then sending them away, he said, I pray</l>

                  <l>And leaving <hi>Egypt</hi> with their num'rous Train,</l>
                  <l>Unto their Father they return'd again:</l>
                  <l>To whom, as soon as e'er they did arrive,</l>
                  <l>They said, Our Brother <hi>Joseph</hi>'s yet alive,</l>
                  <l>And Lord of all the Land, which sore dismay'd</l>
                  <l>Him, for he scarce believed what they said:</l>
                  <l>Then they of all that past gave him relation,</l>
                  <l>And shew'd the Waggons for a confirmation,</l>
                  <l>Which being manifest before his Eyes,</l>

                  <l>With all his Houshold, came to <hi>Bersheba;</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And offer'd Sacrifice there to implore</l>
                  <l>The God his Father <hi>Isaac</hi> did adore.</l>
                  <l>And in the Visions of the Night God spake</l>
                  <l>To him, and said, fear not to undertake</l>
                  <l>This Journey into <hi>Egypt,</hi> for I am</l>
                  <l>The God of thy Fore-fathers, <hi>Abraham</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And <hi>Isaac;</hi> to the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> I</l>
                  <l>Will go with thee, and there will multiply</l>
                  <l>Thy Off-spring, and of thee will surely make</l>
                  <l>A mighty Nation, and will bring thee back;</l>
                  <l>And thy Son <hi>Joseph</hi> there thine Eyes shall close.</l>
                  <l>After which Vision he from thence arose,</l>
                  <l>And in the Waggons which King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> sent,</l>
                  <l>He and his Family to <hi>Egypt</hi> went:</l>
                  <l>His Sons, their Wives and Children, and the rest</l>
                  <l>Of their Concerns, whereof they were possest</l>
                  <l>When they in <hi>Cana'n</hi> dwelt, and they were then</l>
                  <l>No more in number but Threescore and Ten.</l>
                  <l>And when to <hi>Egypt Israel</hi> drew near,</l>
                  <l>He sent before him <hi>Judah,</hi> to prepare</l>
                  <l>His way to <hi>Goshen,</hi> which when <hi>Joseph</hi> heard,</l>
                  <l>Immediately his Chariot he prepar'd,</l>
                  <l>And unto <hi>Goshen</hi> he directly went,</l>
                  <l>And to his Father did himself present;</l>

And being over joy'd fell on his Neck,</l>
                  <l>And for a good while thereupon he wept.</l>
                  <l>Then <hi>Jacob</hi> said, since thou yet liv'st, and I</l>
                  <l>Have seen thy face once more, now let me die.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Joseph</hi> said, my Brethren I will go</l>
                  <l>Unto King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and will let him know</l>
                  <l>That you and all my Father's House are come;</l>

                  <l>And that you've brought your Flocks and Herds all hither</l>
                  <l>Now therefore when you come before the King,</l>
                  <l>And he shall ask you what your Trade hath been,</l>
                  <l>Say thus: Thy Servants from our Youth till now</l>
                  <l>Have dealt in Cattle, we and our Fathers too;</l>
                  <l>That he may let you dwell in <hi>Goshen,</hi> for</l>

With all our Flocks, to get some Pasture here,</l>
                  <l>For in our Land the Famine is severe:</l>
                  <l>We therefore pray thee to appoint a Portion</l>

                  <l>Thou hast our Money and our Cattle too,</l>

                  <l>And the <hi>Egyptians</hi> sold each Man his Field,</l>
                  <l>Beaause the Famine over them prevail'd;</l>
                  <l>And all their Lands became the King's Possession,</l>

A fifth part shall belong unto the Crown,</l>

                  <l>For Seed to sow your Lands, and for supplies</l>
                  <l>Of Food convenient for your Families.</l>
                  <l>And they said; Thou hast sav'd our Lives, my Lord,</l>

                  <l>And we will do according to thy word.</l>

                  <l>That <hi>Pharaoh</hi> should have a fifth part, except</l>
                  <l>The Priests Lands, which unto themselves they kept.</l>
                  <l>And in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ev'n in <hi>Goshen</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Did <hi>Isr'el</hi> dwell, and therein had possession,</l>
                  <l>And grew and multiply'd exceeding fast.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Jacob</hi> liv'd till seventeen Years were past:</l>
                  <l>So that the sum of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s age appears</l>
                  <l>To be an hundred forty seven Years.</l>
                  <l>And when the time approach'd that he must die,</l>

                  <l>And he said, swear unto me, which he did:</l>

                  <l>From trial of your Faith doth Patience flow:</l>

                  <l>If any of you lack Wisdom, let him cry</l>
                  <l>To God, and he will give it lib'rally,</l>

                  <l>Not wavering, for he that wavereth,</l>

                  <l>But you, my Brethren, do the Poor despise.</l>
                  <l>Do not the rich Men o'er you tyrannize,</l>

                  <l>Then if ye do the Royal Law fulfil,</l>
                  <l>To love thy Neighbour as thy self, 'tis well,</l>

                  <l>For he that doth forbid Adultery,</l>

                  <l>My Faith unto thee by the Works I do.</l>
                  <l>Thou dost believe there is one God, 'tis true,</l>
                  <l>The Devils do believe and tremble too.</l>
                  <l>But wilt thou know, vain Man, that Faith is dead</l>
                  <l>Which with good Works is not accompany'd.</l>
                  <l>Was not our Father <hi>Abraham</hi> justify'd</l>
                  <l>By Works, and by the same his Faith was try'd,</l>
                  <l>When he his <hi>Isaac</hi> to the Altar brought,</l>
                  <l>Se'st thou how with his Works his Faith then wrought?</l>
                  <l>And with his Works he perfected his Faith?</l>
                  <l>And so the Scripture was fulfill'd, which saith,</l>

My Brethren, speak not evil of each other:</l>
                  <l>He that doth judge and speak ill of his Brother,</l>
                  <l>Doth judge and speak ill of the Law; therefore</l>
                  <l>If thou dost judge the Law, thou art no more</l>
                  <l>A doer of the same, but dost assume</l>

                     <hi>Elias</hi> was a Man as frail as we are.</l>

                  <l>That there might be no Rain, and or the space</l>
                  <l>Of three Years and six Months no Rain there was;</l>

And afterward, when he again made suit,</l>
                  <l>The Heav'n gave Rain, the Earth brought forth her Fruit.</l>
                  <l>If any one shall from the Truth desert,</l>
                  <l>And one, my Brethren, shall that Man convert;</l>
                  <l>Let him be sure, that he that doth recal</l>
