            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sacred Majesty
CHARLES II.
King of Great Britain, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>May it please Your Majesty,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Dedication of one Part of the
following <hi>Anatomy</hi> having been
very graciously received by Your
Majesty: I am now emboldened most
humbly to present the Whole into
<hi>Your Royal Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which Your Majesty will find, That there
are <hi>Terrae Incognitae</hi> in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> as well as
<hi>Geography.</hi> And for so much, as lies here, it
comes to pass, I know not how, even in this Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Age, That I am the first, who have given a
Map of the Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100350:3"/>
Your Majesty will here see, That there are those
things within a <hi>Plant,</hi> little less admirable, than
within an <hi>Animal.</hi> That a <hi>Plant,</hi> as well as an
<hi>Animal,</hi> is composed of several <hi>Organical Parts;</hi>
some whereof may be called its <hi>Bowels.</hi> That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Plant</hi> hath <hi>Bowels</hi> of divers kinds, conteining
divers kinds of <hi>Liquors.</hi> That even a <hi>Plant</hi> lives
partly upon <hi>Aer;</hi> for the reception whereof, it hath
those Parts which are answerable to <hi>Lungs.</hi> So that
a <hi>Plant</hi> is, it were, an <hi>Animal</hi> in Quires; as an
<hi>Animal</hi> is a <hi>Plant,</hi> or rather several <hi>Plants</hi> bound up
into one <hi>Volume.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, that all the said <hi>Organs, Bowels,</hi> or other
<hi>Parts,</hi> are as artificially made; and for their <hi>Place</hi>
and <hi>Number,</hi> as punctually set together; as all the
<hi>Mathematick Lines</hi> of a <hi>Flower</hi> or <hi>Face.</hi> That
the <hi>Staple</hi> of the <hi>Stuff</hi> is so exquisitely fine, that
no <hi>Silk-worm</hi> is able to draw any thing near so small
a <hi>Thred.</hi> So that one who walks about with the
meanest <hi>Stick,</hi> holds a Piece of Natures Handicraft,
which far surpasses the most elaborate <hi>Woof</hi> or
<hi>Needle-Work</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>That by all these Means, the <hi>Ascent</hi> of the <hi>Sap,</hi>
the <hi>Distribution</hi> of the <hi>Aer,</hi> the <hi>Confection</hi> of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
sorts of <hi>Liquors,</hi> as <hi>Lympha</hi>'s, <hi>Milks, Oyls,
Balsames;</hi> with other parts of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> are all
contrived and brought about in a Mechanical way.
<pb facs="tcp:100350:3"/>
In sum, Your Majesty will find, that we are come
ashore into a new World, whereof we see no end.</p>
            <p>It may be, that some will say, into another <hi>Utopia.</hi>
Yet not I, but Nature speaketh these things: the only
true <hi>Pallas,</hi> wherewith it is treasonable for the most
couriously handed <hi>Arachne</hi> to compare. In whose
Name, I, the meanest of her Pupils, do in all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a <hi>Politick</hi> or <hi>Civil Virtue</hi> in every
prudent mans Eye, To set himself an
example, in what he doth, unto others.
And in so doing, he looks upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as accountable, in some sort, to all
Men. To those therefore, who may
either expresly, or tacitly, expect the Reasons, upon
which I first undertook the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
made the after-progress therein; I shall summe them
up as follows.</p>
            <p>The first occasion of directing my Thoughts this
way, was in the <hi>Year</hi> 1664, upon reading some, of
the many and curious Inventions of Learned Men, in
the <hi>Bodies</hi> of <hi>Animals.</hi> For considering, that both
of them came at first out of the same <hi>Hand;</hi> and
were therefore the <hi>Contrivances</hi> of the same <hi>Wisdom:</hi>
I thence fully assured my self, that it could not be a
vain Design; to seek it in both. And being then new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
furnished with a good stock of <hi>Seeds,</hi> in order to
raise a <hi>Nursery</hi> of <hi>Plants;</hi> I resolved, besides what I
first aimed at, to make the utmost use of them for
that purpose: that so I might put somewhat upon that
side the <hi>Leaf</hi> which the best <hi>Botanicks</hi> had left bare
and empty. And in which, notwithstanding some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Learned Men had inserted somewhat of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
as Dr. <hi>Highmore</hi> in his <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Generation,</hi> Dr.
<hi>Sharrock</hi> of the <hi>Propagation</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hook</hi>
in his <hi>Micrography:</hi> yet but collaterally, and whithout
shewing any purpose of managing this <hi>Part</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
History.</hi> And although it seemed at first an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb facs="tcp:100350:5"/>
in my way, That the first projectors seldome
bring their business to any good end: yet I also knew,
That if Men should stay for an Example in every thing;
nothing extraordinary would ever be done.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding the reasonableness of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
yet I did not forget, that, in respect of the
Undertaker, there might be <hi>Impar congressus.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
before I had ventured very far, in the Year 1668,
I imparted it to my Brother-in-Law, the Learned Dr.
<hi>Henry Sampson,</hi> now <hi>Fellow</hi> of the <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
in <hi>London.</hi> Who not only very well liked the
same; but also excited me to a vigorous and accurate
prosecution of it. Which he did, partly, by mentioning
a very pertinent passage of Dr. <hi>Glisson,</hi> in the <hi>Preface</hi> to
his <hi>Book de Hepate,</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ch. 1.</note> which I had not then read.</p>
            <p>Plantae quoque in hunc censum <hi>(sc. Anatomicum)</hi> veniunt;
variâ enim Partium texturâ, &amp; disserentiis constant: &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culdubio,
ex acurata earundem dissectione, utiles valde obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vationes
nobis exurgerent: praestaretque in illis (inferioris
licet ordinis) rebus examinandis operam impendere, quam in
transcribendis ut saepe sit, aliorum laboribus, inutiliter aetatem
transigere. Quippe hoc pacto, ignavarum apum more, aliena
duntaxat alvearia expilamus, nihilque bono publico adjicimus.</p>
            <p>After I had finished the <hi>First Book,</hi> that I might know
the sense also of other Learned Men, whether the steps
I had already taken, would warrant me to proceed any
further: I put some part of it into the same Hand;
who, in the Year 1670, communicated the same to
Mr. <hi>Oldenburge,</hi> then <hi>Secretary</hi> to the <hi>Royal Society:</hi>
and after he had read it over, it was, upon his motion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to that excellent Person Dr. <hi>John Wilkins</hi> then
<hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Chester;</hi> who produced it at a Meeting of the
<hi>Royal Society,</hi> and desired, they might see the rest. Which,
or the greatest part, being also presented to them, the Right
Honourable the Lord Vicount <hi>Brouncker,</hi> then <hi>President</hi>
of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> was pleased to peruse the same.
Presently, after which, at a Meeting of the Council
<pb facs="tcp:100350:5"/>
of the said <hi>Society,</hi> the following <hi>Order</hi> was made,
and entred in their Council-Book with this Date, and
in these words:
<q>
                  <p>May 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1671.</p>
                  <p>Then was Licensed Dr. <hi>Nehemjah Grew</hi>'s
Book, Entituled, <hi>The Anatomy of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>
begun; together with an account of <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
grounded thereupon. And Ordered to be
Printed by the Printer to the <hi>Royal Society.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon, I was obliged to send the Book to the
Press. And upon the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> following in
the same Year 1671, when it was near being printed,
my Lord <hi>Brouncher</hi> signed the forementioned <hi>Order:</hi> the
Printer, whose Name was to be inserted therein, not
having received his <hi>Diploma</hi> till that time.</p>
            <p>The Book being quickly after printed off; I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it to be Presented to the <hi>Royal Society;</hi> which
was accordingly done at one of their Meetings <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
7,</hi> 1671. And also to be sent to the Bishop of
<hi>Chester;</hi> who was pleased to signifie his acceptance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
by a Letter dated at <hi>Chester, December 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> 1671.
now filed amongst others in the Custody of the <hi>Royal
Society:</hi> part whereof, in regard it relates to matter of
Fact, I shall here recite.</p>

such an one, as hath hitherto lain uncultivated. And
you have been very successful in your first Attempt
about it, in so many remarkable Observations and
Discoveries, as you have made already. I could
heartily wish, that you would still apply your self
to this kind of Enquiries. You will find that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionals
will come in more copiously and easily. And
it is not fit, that any one should, by his Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
carry away the praise from him, who was
the first Inventor, and who laid the Foundations,
wherein the greatest difficulty doth consist, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus submitted my self to the Judgment of
many Learned Men; I saw that my Journey must not
here end. So that, like one who is got into a Wood, I
thought I might as fairly find my way out, by going
on, as by making a retreat. Whereupon, I began to
draw up a <hi>Scheme</hi> of the whole <hi>Design.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While I was doing this, I received news from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
that the same day, <hi>December</hi> 7. 1671, in which
my Book, then printed, was presented to the <hi>Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety:</hi>
there was also presented a <hi>Manuscript</hi> (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Figures)</hi> from Seignior <hi>Malpighi,</hi> upon the same
Subject; dated at <hi>Bononia, November,</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> 1671. the
same, which Mr. <hi>Oldenburge,</hi> when it came to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
calleth his <hi>Idea.</hi> And of this, entry was made in
their Journal Book. So that the <hi>Royal Society</hi> having now
a Prospect of the good service of an Ancient <hi>Member,</hi>
and one, who had highly merited by his Works then
extant; from thence forward, I looked upon my self to
be excused.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>But soon after, receiving another Letter from the
Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> dated at <hi>London, Febr.</hi> 18. 1672. I
<pb facs="tcp:100350:6"/>
found the matter otherwise; and that the <hi>Society</hi> were
pleased to engage me to proceed. Whereof entry was
made by the <hi>Secretary</hi> in their Journal Book, at one
of their Meetings, <hi>April,</hi> 18. 1672, in these words:
<q>The <hi>Society</hi> was made acquainted with one
particular lately passed in the Council; <hi>sc.</hi> That
the Bishop of <hi>Chester</hi> had there proposed <hi>Dr.
Grew</hi> to be a Curator to the <hi>Royal Society</hi>
for the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Plants:</hi> and that the
Council had approved of that <hi>Proposal.</hi> Vpon
which, it was Ordered, That the Thanks of
the <hi>Society</hi> be returned to the Lord Bishop of
<hi>Chester,</hi> for this <hi>Proposal,</hi> and to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
for their Approbation of the same.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This they might be induced to do; upon considering,
that it would be no disadvantage to the credit of those
matters, which were so new and strange, to be offered
to the World from a double Authority. For one, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he may have no mind to deceive; yet is it more
likely for one, than for two, to be deceived. Likewise,
that the same Subject, being prosecuted by two Hands,
would be the more illustrated by the different Examples
produced by both. And that, as in other matters, so
here, the defects of both, would mutually be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
            <p>Whether for these, or other Reasons also, they were
pleased to pass the forementioned <hi>Order;</hi> that being
done, it had been very ill manners in me, not to have
answered their expectation therein. And therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assuming
the Design I had laid by, and having reduced
it to some intelligible <hi>Idea,</hi> it was submitted to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the <hi>Royal Society:</hi> and it was thereupon ordered
it should be printed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100350:7"/>
Not long after, I received a Curious and Learned
Book from Mons. <hi>Dodart, Archiater</hi> to the Prince of
<hi>Conde,</hi> and <hi>Fellow</hi> of the <hi>Royal Academy</hi> at <hi>Paris;</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance
of whose Order, it was by him composed and
published. Which being a Design of a like Import,
I was glad to see it so far justify'd by that Illustrious <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi>
as well as by our own.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Idea,</hi> one principal Thing I insist upon, for
a <hi>Philosophical History</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> is <hi>Anatomy.</hi> And, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Method</hi> therein proposed, all the Observations
conteined in the <hi>First Book,</hi> except one or two, were made
with the <hi>Naked Eye.</hi> To the end, I might first give a
proof, How far it was possible for us to go, without the
help of <hi>Glasses:</hi> which many Ingenious Men want;
and more, the patience to manage them. For the Truth
of these Observations, Seignior <hi>Malpighi,</hi> having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
my Book to be translated into Latin for his
private use, speaks his own sense, in some of his Letters
to Mr. <hi>Oldenburge,</hi> printed at the end of his <hi>Anatomy</hi> of
<hi>Plants.</hi> And some of them, have since been confirmed,
both by our Learned Country-men Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Lister;</hi> and by the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Lewenhoeck,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
            <p>Having thus begun with the bare Eye; I next proceeded
to the use of the <hi>Microscope.</hi> And the Observations
thereby made, first on <hi>Roots,</hi> and afterwards on <hi>Trunks</hi>
and <hi>Branches,</hi> together with the <hi>Figures,</hi> were all exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
to the <hi>Royal Society</hi> at several times from <hi>May 15.
1672.</hi> to <hi>April 2. 1674;</hi> being the <hi>Materials</hi> for the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
and <hi>Third Parts:</hi> and hereof <hi>Memorials</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
in their Journal Books.</p>
            <p>After this, the <hi>Royal Society</hi> received from Seignior
<hi>Malpighi</hi> his <hi>Second Part</hi> of the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the <hi>Figures</hi> therein described, and his <hi>Letters</hi> to
their <hi>Secretary,</hi> dated at <hi>Bononia Aug.</hi> 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the same year
1674. when, and not before, he gave leave that the two
said <hi>Parts</hi> should be printed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100350:7"/>
So soon as I had finished the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third Parts,</hi> I
proceeded to the <hi>Last, sc.</hi> of <hi>Leaves, Flowers, Fruits</hi> and
<hi>Seeds:</hi> and those Things I met with, more remarqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
were presented to the said <hi>Society</hi> in the Years 1676
&amp; 1677. And the publishing of the former <hi>Parts</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively,
as well as of all together, hath been done in
pursuance of their several <hi>Orders</hi> for the same.</p>
            <p>Having concluded the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Perfect Plants;</hi> I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have subjoyned the <hi>Description</hi> of those which
are <hi>Imperfect.</hi> As also of <hi>Parasitical, Marine,</hi> and <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Plants.</hi> And lastly, a view of the chief Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
wherein the <hi>Mechanisme</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> is different from
that of an <hi>Animal.</hi> But these things I leave to some
other Hand.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First Book,</hi> a little after it came forth; was
translated into the French <hi>Tongue,</hi> by Mons. Le <hi>Vasseur</hi>
an Ingenious Gentleman in <hi>Paris;</hi> elegantly, and in the
Judgment of those who are well skilled in that <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi>
with much exactness, as to the sense. He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken special care, to have all the difficulties of
our own, by Me, cleared to him. And in a late Book
Entituled, <hi>Philosophia vetus &amp; nova</hi> printed at <hi>Noriberg
1682.</hi> the Learned Author seems to have made use of this
Translation, for all that he hath taken notice of in that
my <hi>First Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Ingenious Collectors of the <hi>German Epheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides,</hi>
both my <hi>First, Second,</hi> and <hi>Third Books,</hi> are all
published in <hi>Latine.</hi> But their unskilful Interpreter doth
often fail of the <hi>Grammatical Sense.</hi> Whose Errors, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them very gross, I desire may be imputed neither
to them, nor to my self.</p>
            <p>Besides these, the <hi>Second Lecture</hi> of <hi>Mixture</hi> is also
translated into <hi>French,</hi> by Mons. <hi>Mesmin</hi> a Learned
Physician in <hi>Paris:</hi> whose <hi>Version</hi> is very well approved
by those who are competent Judges hereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100350:8"/>
This, and the rest which follow, are placed, not in the
order of <hi>Time;</hi> but more according to their Nature or
Relation one to another. All of them intended as a
Commentary upon some particulars mentioned, either
in the <hi>First Lecture,</hi> or in the <hi>Idea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Plates,</hi> for the clearer conception of the <hi>Part</hi>
described, I have represented it, generally, as entire, as its
being magnified to some good degree, would bear.
So, for instance, not the <hi>Barque, Wood,</hi> or <hi>Pith</hi> of a <hi>Root</hi>
or <hi>Tree,</hi> by it self; but at least, some portion of all three
together: Whereby, both their <hi>Texture,</hi> and also their
Relation one to another, and the <hi>Fabrick</hi> of the whole,
may be observed at one <hi>View.</hi> Yet have I not every
where magnify'd the <hi>Part</hi> to the same degree; but more
or less, as was necessary to represent what is spoken of it.
And very highly, only in some few Examples, as in
<hi>Tab.</hi> 40. which may suffice to illustrate the rest. Some of
the <hi>Plates,</hi> especially those which I did not draw to the
<hi>Engravers</hi> hand, are a little hard and stiff: but they are all
well enough done, to represent what they intend.</p>

IDEA
OF A
Philosophical History
OF
PLANTS.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F WE take an account of the <hi>Degrees</hi> whereunto
the Knowledge of <hi>Vegetables</hi> is Advanced, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
That besides the great Varieties, which
the Successful <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>Florists,</hi> or Transplantations
from one <hi>Climate</hi> to another, have produced; we
have very many <hi>Species</hi> brought to light, especially
Natives of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which the <hi>Ancients,</hi> for any
thing that appears in their <hi>Writings</hi> now extant, were ignorant of.
In which particular <hi>Clusius, Columna, Bauhinus, Boccone,</hi> and others,
have performed much. Withall, That their <hi>Descriptions</hi> (of all Parts
above ground) their <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Seasons,</hi> are with good diligence and
preciseness set before us. Likewise their Order and Kindred: for the
adjusting whereof our Learned Countryman Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Morri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
have both taken very laudable pains. As also the ordering of
them with respect to their <hi>Alimental</hi> and <hi>Mechanick</hi> Uses; for which,
amongst others, Mr. <hi>Evelyn</hi> and Dr. <hi>Beal</hi> have deserved many thanks,
and great praise. We are also informed, of the <hi>Natures</hi> and infallible
<hi>Faculties</hi> of <hi>many</hi> of them. Whereunto so many as have assisted, have
much obliged their <hi>Posterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:100350:12"/>
2. §. By due Reflection upon what hath been <hi>Performed;</hi> it also
appears, what is left <hi>Imperfect,</hi> and what <hi>Vndone.</hi> For the <hi>Virtues</hi> of
most <hi>Plants,</hi> are with much <hi>uncertainty,</hi> and too <hi>promiscuously</hi> ascribed
to them. So that if you turn over an <hi>Herbal,</hi> you shall find almost
every <hi>Herb,</hi> to be good for every <hi>Disease.</hi> And of the <hi>Virtues</hi> of
many, they are altogether silent. And although, for the finding out,
and just appropriation of them, they have left us some <hi>Rules,</hi> yet not
all. The <hi>Descriptions</hi> likewise of many, are yet to be perfected; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
as to their Roots. Those who are very curious about the
other <hi>Parts,</hi> being yet here too remiss. And as for their <hi>Figures,</hi> it
were much to be wished, That they were all drawn by one <hi>Scale;</hi> or,
at most, by Two; one, for <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Shrubs;</hi> and another for <hi>Herbs.</hi>
Many likewise of their <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Affinities,</hi> are yet undetermined.
And a great number of <hi>Names,</hi> both <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> not well given.
So what we call <hi>Goat's-Rue,</hi> is not at all of kin to that Plant, whose
<hi>Generical Name</hi> it bears. The like may be said of <hi>Wild-Tansy, Stock-July-Flowers,
Horse-Radish,</hi> and many more. So also when we say
<hi>Bellis Major, &amp; Minor,</hi> as we commonly do, these <hi>Names</hi> would inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
That the <hi>Plants</hi> to which they are given, differ (as the great
double <hi>Marigold,</hi> doth from the less) only in Bulk: whereas, in truth,
they are two <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi> So we commonly say, <hi>Centaurium Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus
&amp; Minus, Chelidonium Majus &amp; Minus,</hi> and of others in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which yet are distinct <hi>Species,</hi> and of very different <hi>Tribes.</hi> But for
the <hi>Reason</hi> of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> and the <hi>Causes</hi> of all those infinite <hi>Varieties</hi>
therein observable (I mean so far as <hi>Matter,</hi> and the various <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
hereof, are instrumental thereunto) almost all Men have seemed to
be unconcerned.</p>
               <p>3. §. That Nothing hereof remaineth further to be known, is a
Thought not well Calculated. For if we consider how long and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
a <hi>Journey</hi> the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> is; and how short a Time
we have to proceed therein; as on the one hand, we shall conclude it
our ease and profit, To see how far Others have gone before us: so
shall we beware on the other, That we conceive not unduly of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
whilst we have a just value for Those, who were but her <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
and instructed by Her. Their Time and Abilities both, being
short to her; which, as She was first Designed by <hi>Divine Wisdom;</hi>
so may Her vast Dimensions best be adjudged of, in being compared
Therewith. It will therefore be our Prudence, not to insist upon
the Invidious Question, Which of Her <hi>Scholars</hi> have taken the fairest
measure of Her; but to be well satisfied, that as yet She hath not
been Circumscribed by Any.</p>
               <p>4. §. Nor doth it more behove us to consider, how much of the
Nature of <hi>Vegetation</hi> may lie before us yet <hi>unknown;</hi> Than, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
a great part thereof to be <hi>knowable.</hi> Not concluding from the
acknowledged, much less supposed Insuccessfulnes, of any Mens Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings:
but from what may be accounted Possible, as to the Nature
of things themselves; and from <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> by Infinite Ways
conducting to the knowledge of them. Neither can we determine
how great a part This may be: Because, <hi>It is impossible to Measure, what
we See not.</hi> And since we are most likely to under-measure, we shall
hereby but intrench our Endeavours, which we are not wont to carry
beyond the <hi>Idea,</hi> which we have of our <hi>Work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100350:12"/>
5. §. And how far soever this kind of Knowledge may be attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
its being so far also worthy our attainment will be granted. For
beholding the Many and Elegant Varieties, wherewith a Field or
Garden is adorned; Who would not say, That it were exceeding plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to know what we See: and not more delightful, to one who has
<hi>Eyes,</hi> to discern that all is very fine; than to another who hath <hi>Reason,</hi>
to understand <hi>how.</hi> This surely were for a Man to take a True In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory
of his Goods, and his best way to put a price upon them. Yea
it seems, that this were not only to be <hi>Partaker</hi> of <hi>Divine Bounty;</hi>
but also, in some degree, <hi>To be Copartner in the Secrets of Divine Art.</hi>
That which were very desireable, unless we should think it imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for us to design the <hi>Knowing</hi> of <hi>That,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath once
thought fit to <hi>Do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. §. If for these, and other <hi>Reasons,</hi> an inquiry into the Nature
of <hi>Vegetation</hi> may be of good Import; It will be requisite to see, first
of all, What may offer it self to be enquired of; or to understand,
what our <hi>Scope</hi> is: That so doing, we may take our aim the better in
making, and having made, in applying our Observations thereunto.
Amongst other Inquiries therefore, such as these deserve to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
First, by what means it is that a <hi>Plant,</hi> or any <hi>Part</hi> of it, comes
to <hi>Grow,</hi> a <hi>Seed</hi> to put forth a <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Trunk;</hi> and this, all the other
<hi>Parts,</hi> to the <hi>Seed</hi> again; and all these being <hi>formed,</hi> by continual Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
still to be <hi>increased.</hi> How the Aliment by which a <hi>Plant</hi> is
fed, is duly prepared in its several <hi>Parts;</hi> which way it is <hi>conveyed</hi>
unto them; and in what manner it is <hi>assimilated</hi> to their respective Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in them all. Whence this Growth and Augmentation, is not
made of one, but many differing Degrees, unto both extremes of <hi>small</hi>
and <hi>great;</hi> whether the comparison be made betwixt several <hi>Plants,</hi> or
the several <hi>Parts</hi> of one. How not only their <hi>Sizes,</hi> but also their
<hi>Shapes</hi> are so exceeding various; as of <hi>Roots,</hi> in being Thick or Slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Short or Long, Entire or Parted, Stringed or Ramified, and the
like: of <hi>Trunks,</hi> some being more Entire, others Branched, others
Shrub'd: of <hi>Leaves,</hi> which are Long or Round, Even-edg'd or Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callop'd,
and many other ways different, yet always Flat: and so for
the other <hi>Parts.</hi> Then to inquire, What should be the reason of their
various <hi>Motions;</hi> that the <hi>Root</hi> should <hi>descend;</hi> that its descent should
sometimes be <hi>perpendicular,</hi> sometimes more <hi>level:</hi> That the <hi>Trunk</hi> doth
<hi>ascend;</hi> and that the ascent thereof, as to the space of <hi>Time</hi> wherein
it is made, is of different <hi>measures:</hi> and of divers other <hi>Motions,</hi> as
they are observable in the <hi>Roots, Trunks,</hi> and other <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi>
Whence again, these <hi>Motions</hi> have their Different, and Stated <hi>Terms;</hi>
that <hi>Plants</hi> have their set and peculiar <hi>Seasons</hi> for their <hi>Spring</hi> or
<hi>Birth,</hi> for their <hi>Full Growth,</hi> and for their <hi>Teeming;</hi> and the like.
Further, what may be the Causes as of the <hi>Seasons</hi> of their <hi>Growth;</hi>
so of the <hi>Periods</hi> of their <hi>Lives;</hi> some being <hi>Annual,</hi> others <hi>Biennial,</hi>
others <hi>Perennial;</hi> some <hi>Perennial</hi> both as to their <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Trunks;</hi>
and some as to their <hi>Roots</hi> only. Then, as they pass through these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Seasons</hi> of their <hi>Lives,</hi> in what manner their convenient <hi>feeding,
housing, cloathing</hi> or <hi>protection</hi> otherwise, is contrived; wherein, in this
kind and harmonious <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> one <hi>Part,</hi> may be officious to another,
for the preservation of the health and life of the <hi>whole.</hi> And lastly,
what care is taken, not only for themselves, but for their <hi>Posterity;</hi> in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100350:13"/>
what manner the <hi>Seed</hi> is prepared, formed and fitted for <hi>Propagation:</hi>
and this being of so great concernment, how sometimes the other <hi>Parts</hi>
also, as <hi>Roots,</hi> in putting forth <hi>Trunks; Trunks</hi> in putting forth <hi>Roots;</hi>
yea in turning oftentimes into <hi>Roots</hi> themselves; whereof, in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Book of the Anatomy of Plants,</hi> I shall give some instances. With
other <hi>Heads</hi> of Inquiry of this kind.</p>
               <p>7. §. Nor are the <hi>Natures, Faculties,</hi> and <hi>Contents</hi> of <hi>Vegetables</hi>
less various, or a particular Inspection hereinto, of less concernment.
For since All, or Most, seem to grow in the same manner, with one <hi>Sun,</hi>
one <hi>Rain,</hi> indifferently well upon one <hi>Soil,</hi> and, to outward appearance,
to have the same <hi>Common Parts;</hi> it may be asked, <hi>How</hi> it comes to pass,
that their <hi>Liquors,</hi> or other <hi>Contained Parts,</hi> are of such different
<hi>Kinds;</hi> one being Watry, another Winy, a third <hi>Oily,</hi> a fourth <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky,</hi>
and the like. <hi>How</hi> also there is such a variety in their <hi>Sensible
Qualities,</hi> as their <hi>Colours, Tastes,</hi> and <hi>Smells;</hi> what those <hi>Materials</hi>
are, which are necessary to the <hi>Being</hi> of these <hi>Qualities;</hi> and those
<hi>Formalities,</hi> wherein their <hi>Essence</hi> doth consist; as what it is that makes
a <hi>Plant,</hi> or <hi>Flower,</hi> to be <hi>White</hi> or <hi>red; fragrant</hi> or <hi>fetid; bitter</hi> or <hi>sweet;</hi>
or to be of any other <hi>Colour, Smell,</hi> or <hi>Taste.</hi> In like manner, their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi>
and <hi>Powers,</hi> what that is, or those things are, by which they
are constituted; as whence one becomes <hi>Purgative,</hi> another <hi>Vomitory,</hi>
a third <hi>Diaphoretick, &amp;c,</hi> These, I say, with many other particular
Inquiries depending hereupon; as they cannot but much oblige the
Reason of Man to be obsequious to them, so by bringing in, at least,
some satisfaction, will no less reward it. Especially, if it be withal
considered, that besides our satisfaction as to the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Vegetation;</hi>
some further Light, to divers other parts of Knowledge, may likewise
hence arise.</p>
               <p>8. §. For since the present Design will ingage us, to an accurate
and multifarious Observation of <hi>Plants;</hi> we may hereby be enabled
to <hi>range</hi> and <hi>sort</hi> them with more certainty, according to the Degrees
of their <hi>Affinity.</hi> And all <hi>Exoticks, Plants</hi> or <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> may
probably be reduced to some such <hi>Domesticks,</hi> unto which they may
bear the best Resemblance. Again, it may frequently conduct our
minds to the consideration of the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Animals;</hi> as whether there
are not divers material Agreements betwixt them both; and what
they are. <hi>Wherein</hi> also they may considerably differ, and what those
things are which are more essential to their distinguishment. And <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,</hi>
not only to compare what is already known of both; but also,
by what may be observed in the <hi>one,</hi> to suggest and facilitate the finding
out of what may yet be unobserved in the <hi>other.</hi> So <hi>also</hi> the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the <hi>Colours, Smells</hi> and <hi>Tastes</hi> of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> may conduce to
the Knowledge of the same <hi>Qualities</hi> in General; or of what it is, that
constitutes them such, in any other Body: not as they are <hi>actually</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by <hi>Sense;</hi> but so far, as such <hi>Materials</hi> or external <hi>Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
are requisite to their becoming the <hi>Adequate Objects</hi> thereof. <hi>It
may</hi> lead us also to inquire into further Ways of <hi>Cultivation,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the whole <hi>Plant,</hi> or to the <hi>Flower, Fruit,</hi> or other <hi>Part:</hi>
To amend them as to their <hi>Sizes, Colours, Tastes, Fruitfulness,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
To think of other Ways of <hi>Propagation;</hi> or to apply those al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
known to other <hi>Plants</hi> than hath been used. Likewise the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their <hi>Mechanical</hi> Uses may hereby be enlarged; both as to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100350:13"/>
Reason of their use, in such particular <hi>Trades</hi> and <hi>Manufactures,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
known; and the discovery of other uses yet unknown. As also
their <hi>Alimental,</hi> with respect both to <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks;</hi> the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some, and the finding out of others. But especially their <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal;</hi>
some <hi>Plants</hi> which have hitherto been neglected, may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to use; the <hi>Perverted</hi> uses of some, and the <hi>Confused</hi> uses of
others, may be rectified. What may best correct their <hi>Malignancies,</hi>
or inforce their <hi>Virtues;</hi> When needful to add the preparations of <hi>Art</hi>
to That of <hi>Nature;</hi> How to Enlarge those of <hi>Art,</hi> and Rectifie those
which are indeed Inartificial, may hereby be better conjectured. The
knowledge of all which, that we may know how far it is accessible,
and what probable Approaches may be made towards it; those seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Means I have thought of, and suppose necessary thereunto, are next
to be proposed.</p>
               <p>9. §. Reflecting then upon the present Design, and seeing this to
lie wide; we shall, in the first place, conclude the <hi>Means</hi> attending
thereon, should do so likewise. Wherefore, although some may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
themselves unto us as more promising; yet let us suppose what
several Persons, were they hereunto engaged, each according to his
Sense and Genius, would possibly make choice of. Believing, that
although Considering Men may vary, in the approval of their own
Sense and Notion; yet not always mearly, because it is their own;
but because each, may probably see somewhat more in his own, than
others do. Wherefore it will be our surest Logick to conclude, Not
because no <hi>Mean</hi> may be approved by all Men, that all <hi>Means</hi> should
be rejected; but rather, because each may be approved by some, that
therefore, all be made choice of. And these, I think, may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
under Five General <hi>Heads</hi> of Enquiry. <hi>First,</hi> Of those Things,
which are of more <hi>External</hi> Consideration about <hi>Plants,</hi> as their <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
&amp;c. Secondly,</hi> Of their Compounding <hi>Parts,</hi> as <hi>Vessels, &amp;c.
Thirdly,</hi> Of their <hi>Liquors,</hi> and other <hi>Contents. Fourthly,</hi> Of their
<hi>Principles,</hi> as <hi>Salts, &amp;c. Fifthly,</hi> Of their <hi>Aliment,</hi> as <hi>Water,</hi> and other
Means of Growth.</p>
               <p>10. §. AND FIRST of all,<note place="margin">The First General <hi>Mean.</hi>
                  </note> whatever is of more <hi>External</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
as the <hi>Figures, Proportions, Motions, Seasons, Situations</hi> of
<hi>Vegetables,</hi> and of their several <hi>Parts,</hi> should be observed. In doing
which, a particular survey of all their Varieties should be taken. And
then a Comparison made betwixt these, and the several <hi>Plants,</hi> or <hi>Parts</hi>
of <hi>Plants,</hi> whereof they are the <hi>Properties.</hi> To the end, We may, if
possible, be thereby conducted to find out, what other, either sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or more recluse <hi>Property,</hi> any of them may agree together in. For
it is not more certain, that the three Angles of every <hi>Rectilinear Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,</hi>
because all ways equal to two <hi>Right Angles,</hi> are therefore, if put
together, always the same: than that <hi>one Property,</hi> agreeing to divers
<hi>Vegetables,</hi> should have one <hi>Cause:</hi> For although the <hi>Scope</hi> and <hi>End</hi>
may vary; yet the <hi>Cause,</hi> as it is the <hi>Cause</hi> of that <hi>Property,</hi> must be
<hi>one:</hi> and consequently, must also import some <hi>Identity</hi> in the <hi>Nature</hi>
of all those <hi>Vegetables</hi> wherein it Acts. Wherefore by thus comparing
of them, we shall be able more exactly to state the <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi>
of their <hi>Affinities;</hi> Better to understand both the <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> of
their <hi>Varieties:</hi> And more probably to conjecture of their <hi>Natures</hi> and
<hi>Vertues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100350:14"/>
11. §. First then the various <hi>Figures</hi> of their several <hi>Parts</hi> should
be observed; and that with respect both to the <hi>Forms,</hi> and the <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
by which their <hi>Roots, Trunks, Branches, Leaves, Flowers, Fruits,</hi>
and <hi>Seeds</hi> may vary, or agree; and those several <hi>Lines,</hi> by which
both the said <hi>Varieties</hi> are determin'd. In which of these <hi>Parts,</hi> the
agreement chiefly lies; this being both more observable, and more
material in some of them; less in the Root, more in the Flower, or
Seed. And in how many of these <hi>Parts</hi> together; whether one, more,
or all. By both which, the <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>Affinity,</hi> which
are many, may be accounted; either as to what we strictly call <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi>
or else <hi>Analogy.</hi> For there are found, not only <hi>Herbs</hi> account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of several <hi>Tribes,</hi> which are ally'd; and some of the Smallest, which
are of kin to the Greatest: But there are also, probably, some <hi>Herbs,</hi>
which have a particular Relation, to many Kinds of <hi>Shrubs;</hi> and some
<hi>Shrubs,</hi> to many Kinds of <hi>Trees.</hi> Thus the several sorts of <hi>Letuce,</hi> are
of Kin, together in the <hi>First Degree;</hi> with <hi>Endive,</hi> in the <hi>Second.</hi> The
several <hi>Clarys,</hi> amongst themselves in the <hi>First;</hi> with <hi>Horehound,</hi> in
the <hi>Second;</hi> with <hi>Lamium,</hi> in the <hi>Third.</hi> All <hi>Strawberries</hi> agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in the <hi>First Degree;</hi> with <hi>Cinquefoyl,</hi> in the <hi>Second;</hi> with <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentil</hi>
in the <hi>Third;</hi> and with <hi>Avens, &amp;c.</hi> in other Degrees more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.
So <hi>Agrimony,</hi> hath alike Analogy unto <hi>Strawberry;</hi> as <hi>Goats-Rue,</hi>
hath to <hi>Claver:</hi> And <hi>Strawberry,</hi> the like unto the <hi>Rasp;</hi> as <hi>Goos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry</hi>
to the <hi>Vine;</hi> or <hi>Burnet,</hi> to the <hi>Rose.</hi> Amongst the several <hi>Sorts</hi>
of <hi>Grass,</hi> there are some which match all those of <hi>Corn;</hi> which is but a
greater kind of <hi>Grass.</hi> So again all <hi>Pulse,</hi> are not only of kin, in their
several Degrees, to one another; but likewise, to almost all kinds of
<hi>Trefoyls,</hi> as <hi>Melilot, Foenugreek,</hi> and the common <hi>Clavers</hi> themselves;
as by comparing not only their <hi>Leaves,</hi> but <hi>Flowers, Seeds,</hi> and <hi>Cods</hi>
together, may be evident. For the several <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Flower</hi> of a
<hi>Trefoyl,</hi> are so many more <hi>Flowers,</hi> containing so many <hi>Cods</hi> of small
<hi>Seeds,</hi> all, in shape, agreeable to the <hi>Flowers, Cods,</hi> and <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Pulse.</hi>
The same Relation, which <hi>Trefoyls</hi> have to the <hi>Peas</hi> or other <hi>Pulse;
Colts-foot,</hi> hath to <hi>Buttyr-Bur; Chickweed</hi> to <hi>Leu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>anthemum; Ground-sell,</hi>
to <hi>Jacobaea,</hi> or <hi>Scorodonia,</hi> to <hi>Foxglove:</hi> Or, to go higher, as the
<hi>Leguminous</hi> Kinds of <hi>Herbs,</hi> have to <hi>Sena,</hi> or some other of the <hi>Lobed
Shrubs</hi> and <hi>Trees.</hi> And, as among <hi>Animals,</hi> there are some which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect
several Kinds; as the <hi>Batt</hi> doth <hi>Beasts</hi> and <hi>Birds:</hi> So, among
<hi>Plants,</hi> there are some also, which seem to stand between two <hi>Tribes;</hi>
as <hi>Lappa,</hi> between <hi>Knapweeds</hi> and <hi>Thistles; Lampsana,</hi> between the
<hi>Intybaceous</hi> Kind, and the <hi>Mouse-ears.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. §. From hence likewise, the <hi>Natures</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> may be conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured.
For in looking upon divers <hi>Plants,</hi> though of different
<hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Kinds;</hi> yet if some a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>inity may be found betwixt them,
then the <hi>Nature</hi> of any one of them being well known, we have thence
ground of conjecture, as to the <hi>Nature</hi> of all the rest. So that as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Plant</hi> may have somewhat of <hi>Nature individual</hi> to it self; so, as far
as it obtaineth any <hi>Visible Communities</hi> with other <hi>Plants,</hi> so far, may
it partake of <hi>Common Nature</hi> with those also. Thus the <hi>Wild,</hi> and
<hi>Garden Cucumers,</hi> have this difference; that the one <hi>purgeth</hi> strongly,
the other, <hi>not at all:</hi> yet in being <hi>Diuretick,</hi> they both agree. The
<hi>Natures</hi> of <hi>Umbelliferous Plants,</hi> we know, are various; yet 'tis most
probable, that they all agree in this one, <hi>scil.</hi> in being <hi>Carminative.</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100350:14"/>
The several sorts, both of <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Grass,</hi> are all akin; there is no
doubt therefore, but that the <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Grass</hi> themselves (of <hi>Rye</hi> and
<hi>Oats</hi> it is tryed) if it were worth the while to order them, as <hi>Barley,</hi>
would yield an inflammable Spirit. So likewise the several Kinds of
<hi>Pulse,</hi> have some one community in their Form, as is said: for which
reason, I question not, but that in some Cases, wherein <hi>Cicers</hi> are esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a good <hi>Medicine;</hi> a <hi>Decoction</hi> of the better sort of <hi>Pease,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
that we call the <hi>Sugar-Pease,</hi> may go beyond them. As doth also
the <hi>Flower</hi> or <hi>Meal</hi> of <hi>Beans,</hi> that of the <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Foenugreek;</hi> even
there, where they are accounted excellent. So <hi>Tulips, Lillies, Crocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Jacynths,</hi> and <hi>Onions</hi> themselves, with many others, in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Degrees, are all <hi>allied.</hi> If therefore <hi>Crocuses, Onions, Lillies,</hi> agree
in one or more <hi>Faculties,</hi> then why may not all the rest? as in being
<hi>Anodyne;</hi> or in some other <hi>Common Nature;</hi> whereby, in their <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
their <hi>Parts</hi> are Governed and Over-ruled, to one Common or
<hi>Analogous Form.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13. §. The <hi>Proportions</hi> likewise, amongst the several <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,</hi>
for the same Reasons, deserve to be observed; the comparison
being made, both betwixt the <hi>Parts</hi> of several <hi>Plants,</hi> and the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Parts</hi> of one. And here again, either betwixt any Two of the
<hi>Parts,</hi> or any One of them, and the Whole besides, or all the rest
put together. So some larger <hi>Seeds,</hi> produce a small <hi>Root;</hi> as those
of <hi>Cucumer:</hi> and others smaller, produce one very great; as those of
<hi>Bryony.</hi> Some <hi>Plants,</hi> as the <hi>Melon,</hi> though themselves but very slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
yet have a vast and bulky <hi>Fruit;</hi> others again, as <hi>Thistles,</hi> and
many yet more substantial, have no other <hi>Fruit,</hi> besides their <hi>Seed.</hi>
So the <hi>Seeds</hi> of all <hi>Pulse,</hi> and especially, the <hi>Garden Bean,</hi> though
large, yet produce but a small <hi>Plant:</hi> but those of <hi>Foxglove, Mullen,
Burdock, Sun-flower, &amp;c.</hi> being themselves much less, do yet produce
a far greater. And especially, those <hi>Seeds,</hi> which are inclosed in the
Thicker sort of <hi>Cover,</hi> (analogous to that I have elsewhere called
the <hi>Secondine)</hi> as that of <hi>Peony;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anat. Plant. Book 1. Chap. ult.</note> whose <hi>Seed,</hi> so called, is only the
<hi>Nest</hi> wherein the true and real <hi>Seed</hi> is lodged, no bigger than a little
Pins head: which is also observable of the <hi>Seeds</hi> of divers other
<hi>Plants.</hi> These, and the like <hi>Proportions,</hi> as they lie betwixt the several
<hi>Parts,</hi> should be noted: and to what <hi>Plants</hi> or <hi>Parts</hi> especially, any
of them may agree: comparing also in what other kind of <hi>Properties</hi>
an agreement betwixt the said <hi>Parts</hi> may be found: that so doing, we
may, if possible, amongst all their <hi>Individual Natures,</hi> be instructed to
single out those <hi>Common Ones,</hi> which are concomitant to such Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Properties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14. §. The several <hi>Seasons</hi> also of <hi>Plants,</hi> and of their <hi>Parts,</hi> should
be considered. Observing at what particular Times of the Year, any
of them chiefly <hi>Spring,</hi> Early or Late. The Times wherein they <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate;</hi>
whether for some Space only, or all the Year long. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they <hi>Spring,</hi> after Sowing; or <hi>Flower,</hi> after Springing, sooner, or
slower. Which Flower, the <hi>first</hi> Year, or not till the <hi>second.</hi> Which
<hi>after</hi> the <hi>Leaves</hi> are put forth, or <hi>before</hi> them; for so, some do, as
the <hi>Crocus Vernus, Bears-foot, Hepatica aurea,</hi> and others; all the <hi>Leaves,</hi>
at the time of their flowering, being old, or of the foregoing Year's
growth. So likewise the <hi>Maturation</hi> of the <hi>Fruit</hi> or <hi>Seed;</hi> how long
after the <hi>Flower,</hi> and the like. All or some of which <hi>Varieties,</hi> being
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100350:15"/>
laid together, we may probably conjecture the <hi>Causes</hi> thereof; and
the <hi>Natures</hi> of the <hi>Plants</hi> in which they are seen: <hi>scil.</hi> as such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Heat may be necessary for the Fermentation, or the better Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution
of the <hi>Sap</hi> of such a <hi>Plant;</hi> or for the Impregnation of
the <hi>Aer,</hi> to be mixed therewith; or the due Disposing of the <hi>Soil,</hi> to
render the most convenient Aliment thereunto. So the <hi>Principles</hi> of
such <hi>Plants,</hi> which flower all the Year, may be more equally propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.
Those which flower before the <hi>Leaves</hi> put forth, as the <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Vernus,</hi> and those which flower in <hi>Spring,</hi> may be accounted <hi>Rank,</hi>
and full of <hi>Volatile Salt.</hi> But <hi>Autumn Plants</hi> especially, to abound with
a Fixed: and the like.</p>
               <p>15. §. The proper <hi>Places</hi> also of <hi>Plants,</hi> or such wherein they
have, from their <hi>Seeds,</hi> or other way of <hi>Propagation,</hi> a Spontaneous
growth, should be considered. And that as to the <hi>Climate;</hi> whether
in one Colder, Temperate, or more Hot. The <hi>Region;</hi> Continent,
or Island. The <hi>Seat;</hi> as Sea, or Land, Watry, Boggy, or Dry; Hills,
Plains, or Vallies; Open, in Woods, or under Hedges; Against <hi>Walls,</hi>
rooted in them, or on their Tops: and the like. And perhaps the
<hi>Seeds</hi> of some <hi>Plants,</hi> as of <hi>Mosses,</hi> (which, through their smallness,
will ascend like Moths in the Sun) may fly or swim for some time, in
the Aer, <hi>viz.</hi> till they begin to shoot, and so become heavy enough,
to fall down upon the Ground. From whence, in like manner, as
from their <hi>Seasons,</hi> their particular <hi>Natures</hi> may be directed unto.
In that, so far as we may conjecture the nature of such an <hi>Aer, Soil,</hi> or
<hi>Seat,</hi> we may also of such a <hi>Plant,</hi> to which they are <hi>congenial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>16. §. So likewise, those many Varieties observable in the <hi>Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of <hi>Plants,</hi> and of their Parts, both Kinds and Degrees; <hi>Ascending,
Descending,</hi> and <hi>Horizontal; Rectilinear,</hi> and <hi>Spiral Motions,</hi> should be
noted; to what <hi>Plants</hi> they agree, and wherein any of these Motions
may be analogous to those of <hi>Animals.</hi> And in a word, any other
<hi>Forensick Properties</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi> And then, to Compare them all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
both being necessary. For <hi>Thoughts</hi> cannot work upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
no more than <hi>Hands.</hi> He that will build an House, must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
Materials. And on the contrary, the Materials will never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an House, unless, by certain Rules, we joyn them all together.
So, it is not, <hi>simply,</hi> the Knowledge of <hi>many things,</hi> but a multifari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Copulation of them in the Mind, that becomes prolifick of further
Knowledge. And thus much for the first General <hi>Mean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17. §. THE NEXT which I propose,<note place="margin">The Second General <hi>Mean.</hi>
                  </note> and that a most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
one, is <hi>Anatomy.</hi> For when upon the Dissection of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> we
see so great a difference in them, that not only their Outward <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi>
but also their Inward <hi>Structure,</hi> is so Elegant; and in all, so
Various; it must needs lead us thus to Think, That these Inward
<hi>Varieties,</hi> were either to no <hi>End;</hi> or if they were, we must assign to
what. To imagine the first, were exceeding vain; as if <hi>Nature,</hi> the
Handmaid of <hi>Divine Wisdom,</hi> should with Her fine <hi>Needle</hi> and <hi>Thred,</hi>
stitch up so many several <hi>Pieces,</hi> of so difficult, and yet so groundless
a Work. But if for some <hi>End,</hi> then either only to be looked upon,
or some other besides. If for this only, then this must be such as in
respect whereof, Her Work is at no time, nor in any degree frustrate;
the contrary whereunto, is most manifest. For although Men do
every where, with frequent pleasure, behold the Outward Elegancies of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100350:15"/>
                  <hi>Plants;</hi> yet the Inward Ones, which, generally, are as Precise and
Various as the Outward; we see, how usual it is, for the beholding of
These, to be omitted by them. And besides, when we have observed
<hi>Nature's</hi> Work, as well as we can; it may be no impediment to our
best Endeavours, to believe, That some Parts of it, will still remain
behind, <hi>Unseen.</hi> So that if to be <hi>Seen,</hi> were the only End of it, it must
needs be wholly frustrate, as to the greater number of Men; and, in
some part, as to all. Wherefore, we must suppose some other <hi>Ends</hi>
of the said Varieties, which should have their <hi>Effect,</hi> and so These,
not be in vain, whether Men beheld them or not; which, are, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
such as have respect to <hi>Vegetation:</hi> That the <hi>Corn</hi> might grow,
<hi>so;</hi> and the <hi>Flower, so,</hi> whether or no Men had a mind, leisure, or abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
to understand <hi>how.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. §. If then the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Vegetables</hi> be so useful a <hi>Mean,</hi> we
ought not to streighten it; but to force this, as well as the rest, to its
utmost Extent. And therefore, first of all, To go through all the
<hi>Parts,</hi> with equal care; examining the <hi>Root, Trunk, Branch, Leaf,
Flower, Fruit,</hi> and <hi>Seed.</hi> Then to Repeat or Retrograde the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section,
from <hi>Part</hi> to <hi>Part:</hi> in that, although the best Method of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery,
for clear Discourse, can be but one, according to that of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
from the <hi>Seed</hi> forward, to the <hi>Seed:</hi> yet can it not but be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
for That of Dissection, to proceed <hi>to</hi> and <hi>fro;</hi> somewhat or other
being more Visible in each several <hi>Part,</hi> from whence still an Hint
may be taken, for the ushering in the observation of it in the others.
To examine, again, not only all the <hi>Parts,</hi> but <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> and
comparatively, to observe divers of the same <hi>size, shape, motion, age,
sap, quality, power,</hi> or any other way the <hi>same,</hi> which may also agree,
in some one or more particulars, as to their <hi>Interiour Structure:</hi> and to
make this comparison, throughout all their <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Properties.</hi> To
observe them likewise, in several <hi>Seasons</hi> of the Year, and in several
<hi>Ages</hi> of the <hi>Plants,</hi> and of their <hi>Parts;</hi> in both which, divers of them
may be noted to change, not only their <hi>Dimensions,</hi> but their <hi>Natures</hi>
also; as <hi>Vessels,</hi> do into <hi>Ligaments;</hi> and <hi>Cartilages,</hi> into <hi>Bones,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
in <hi>Animals.</hi> And to do all this by several Ways of <hi>Section,</hi>
Oblique, Perpendicular, and Transverse; all three being requisite, if
not to Observe, yet the better to Comprehend, some Things. And
it will be convenient sometimes to Break, Tear, or otherwise Divide,
without a <hi>Section.</hi> Together with the <hi>Knife</hi> it will be necessary to
joyn the <hi>Microscope;</hi> and to examine all the <hi>Parts,</hi> and every Way, in
the use of That. As also, that both Immediate, and Microscopical
Inspections, be Compared: since it is certain, That some things, may
be demonstrated by Reason and the Eye conjunct, without a Glass,
which cannot be discovered by it; or else the discovery is so dark, as
which, alone, may not be safely depended on.</p>
               <p>19. §. By these several Ways of Inspection, it will be requisite, To
observe their Compounding <hi>Parts;</hi> as <hi>Simply</hi> considered, and as variously
<hi>Proportioned,</hi> and <hi>Disposed.</hi> As <hi>Simply</hi> considered, to note their <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi>
what, and whether the same, in all: their <hi>Kinds,</hi> wherein dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in the same, or divers <hi>Vegetables:</hi> their <hi>Original,</hi> in part, or in
whole: <hi>Structure,</hi> as to their <hi>Contexture</hi> and their <hi>Cavities;</hi> Their
<hi>Contexture,</hi> within themselves severally, and as joyned together: their
<hi>Cavities,</hi> as to their <hi>Size, Shape,</hi> and <hi>Number;</hi> in which a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100350:16"/>
will be sound. Next their <hi>Positions</hi> one amongst another, which
are also various; as Anterior, Posterior, Collateral, Surrounding, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,
Immediate, Near, Remote; both as they respect the several
<hi>Parts,</hi> and the several portions of one: And all these, as few, or more;
these or others of them, may be diversly Compounded together. And
then the <hi>Proportions</hi> they bear one to another; whether as to Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Equality, or Excess; each <hi>Part</hi> compared with each, and that
as to the several Degrees appearing in the said <hi>Proportions;</hi> the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties
whereof may be exceeding numerous. For if we should suppose
but <hi>Four</hi> considerable <hi>Parts</hi> generally constitutive of a <hi>Vegetable:</hi>
These <hi>Four,</hi> produce a Variety <hi>Four</hi> ways. First, when One is Une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual;
and then it produceth only <hi>Four</hi> Varieties: and those two ways,
<hi>scil.</hi> when one is Greater, and the other three, Equal and Less; or
when one is Less; and the other three, Equal and Greater. Secondly,
when Two be Unequal; and then they produce <hi>Six</hi> Varieties. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when Three be Unequal, which produceth <hi>Twelve</hi> Varieties. Or
lastly, when all Four be Unequal; which produceth <hi>Twenty four:</hi>
which general Varieties, may be further multiplied by their several
Degrees.</p>
               <p>20. §. From all which, we may come to know, what the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities</hi>
of <hi>Vegetables</hi> are, as belonging to all; what their <hi>Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
to such a Kind; their <hi>Properties,</hi> to such a Species; and their <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarities,</hi>
to such Particular ones. And as in <hi>Metaphysical,</hi> or other
Contemplative Matters, when we have a distinct knowledge of the
<hi>Communities</hi> and <hi>Differences</hi> of Things, we may then be able to give
their true <hi>Definitions:</hi> so may we possibly, here attain, to do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
not only to know, That every <hi>plant</hi> Inwardly differs from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
but also wherein; so as not more surely to Define by the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Figure,</hi> than by the Inward <hi>Structure,</hi> What that is, or those
things are, whereby any <hi>Plant,</hi> or Sort of <hi>Plants,</hi> may be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from all others. And having obtained a knowledge of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities</hi>
and <hi>Differences</hi> amongst the <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Vegetables;</hi> it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
us through a <hi>Series</hi> of more facile and probable <hi>Conclusions,</hi> of the
ways of their <hi>Causality,</hi> as to the <hi>Communities</hi> and <hi>Differences</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation.</hi>
And thus much for the Second General <hi>Mean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>21. §. HAVING THUS far examined the <hi>Organical</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Parts</hi> of <hi>Vegetables;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Third General <hi>Mean.</hi>
                  </note> it will be requisite, more designedly,
to observe those also which are <hi>Fluid,</hi> or any others Contained in
them: and that, for our better understanding both of the <hi>Nature</hi> of
<hi>Vegetation,</hi> and of the said <hi>Contained Parts.</hi> And to make inquiry, <hi>First</hi>
of their <hi>Kinds;</hi> as <hi>Spirits;</hi> both such as agree, in general, in being
<hi>Vinous;</hi> and those that are Special, to particular <hi>Plants. Aers</hi> and
<hi>Vapours;</hi> for the existence whereof, in all <hi>Vegetables,</hi> there are Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
certainly concluding. And for the difference of their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
in being more dry, or moist, more simple or compounded, as
they are existent in several <hi>Parts,</hi> there are probable ones. <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha's</hi>
or clear and watry <hi>Saps;</hi> which most <hi>Plants,</hi> in one <hi>Part</hi> or other,
at some time of the Year, do <hi>Bleed Mucilages;</hi> as in <hi>Mallow</hi> and <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
Leaves;</hi> in many <hi>Seeds,</hi> as of <hi>Quinces, Clary; Fruits,</hi> as in <hi>Cucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers;</hi>
distinct from the watry <hi>Sap,</hi> as by permitting it to stand and
gelly upon the <hi>Vessels</hi> from whence it issues, is plain: And in the
young <hi>Berrys</hi> of White <hi>Bryony,</hi> when about the bigness of a <hi>Pepper-Corn;</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100350:16"/>
the juyce whereof is so Viscous, that the twentieth part of a
<hi>Grain,</hi> will draw out above a <hi>Yard</hi> in length. <hi>Oyles;</hi> not only in
<hi>Seeds,</hi> and some <hi>Fruits,</hi> but other <hi>Parts;</hi> as in certain little cavities in
the <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Savine,</hi> visibly collected while they are growing. <hi>Gumms</hi>
or <hi>Resines;</hi> as in <hi>Pine, Fir,</hi> and others of this Kind. <hi>Milks;</hi> as
in a vast number of <hi>Plants,</hi> and amongst them, many not suspected to
yield any. For, of <hi>Herbs,</hi> not only most of the <hi>Umbelliferous Kind,</hi>
are <hi>Milky;</hi> but all or most of the <hi>Intybous; Poppys; Tracheliums;
Perwinkles;</hi> divers <hi>Thistles;</hi> and even <hi>Onions,</hi> if cut at the bottome;
with a great many more. Of <hi>Trees,</hi> not only the Little <hi>Maple,</hi> but
the young <hi>Shoots</hi> of <hi>Lawrel,</hi> especially being crushed; as also those of
<hi>Elder,</hi> and some others. To which may be added, such <hi>Mucilages,</hi>
which though not so properly contained <hi>within</hi> the <hi>Parts,</hi> yet are
found lying <hi>over</hi> them; as over the first <hi>Spring-leaves</hi> of all kinds of
<hi>Docks;</hi> betwixt the <hi>Leaves</hi> and the <hi>Veil</hi> wherein they are involved.
That fine white Flower or Powder, which lies over the <hi>Leaves</hi> of some
<hi>Plants,</hi> as of <hi>Bears-Ear:</hi> And in <hi>Princes-Feather,</hi> about certain <hi>Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
only on the edges of the <hi>Leaves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>22. §. Of all these should be observed, <hi>first</hi> their <hi>Receptacles;</hi>
some of them, being proper to one; others, common to two or more
of them: since it is certain, that some of them do Transmigrate from
one, into another <hi>Receptacle,</hi> or that the same <hi>Receptacle</hi> is filled with
Fluid Bodies of a quite different Nature, at the different <hi>Seasons</hi> of
the <hi>Year,</hi> and <hi>Ages</hi> of the <hi>Vegetable.</hi> And it is also very probable, That
two of some of them, may, sometimes, be contained in one <hi>Receptacle,</hi>
at the same time; as in <hi>Animals,</hi> the <hi>Lympha</hi> in the D. <hi>Thora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>icus,</hi> and
that, and the <hi>Chyle,</hi> in the <hi>Sanguineous Vessels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>23. §. Then their <hi>Motions;</hi> both <hi>Natural,</hi> and such as may be
effected by <hi>Art:</hi> and those either by Descent or Ascent; And in
ascending, through what different <hi>Chanels</hi> or <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Trunk;</hi> since
it is certain, That there is a variety, both in respect of the <hi>Season,</hi> and
of <hi>Vegetables.</hi> Where it will fall in, To observe the <hi>Tapping</hi> of <hi>Trees.</hi>
As also their <hi>Bleeding:</hi> to what <hi>Trees</hi> it is proper to <hi>bleed:</hi> in those to
which it is, with what difference of <hi>Celerity:</hi> and when their peculiar
<hi>Season:</hi> for none will bleed at all times; neither will all <hi>bleed</hi> at the
same. And then their Collateral <hi>Motion,</hi> together with the Mode of
their Transition from one <hi>Organical Part</hi> to another.</p>
               <p>24. §. Next their <hi>Quantities,</hi> either of <hi>one;</hi> as the Comparison
is made betwixt several <hi>Plants,</hi> or betwixt the <hi>Parts</hi> of the same. So
the true <hi>Seed</hi> of all <hi>Plants,</hi> containeth more <hi>Oyl,</hi> in proportion, than
any of the other <hi>Parts.</hi> Or else of <hi>divers,</hi> as coexistent and bearing such
a proportion one to another in the same <hi>Part:</hi> of most of which, it
may be known by their respective <hi>Receptacles.</hi> Yet the Computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
must not be made from the number of the said <hi>Receptacles, simply;</hi>
but as that is in conjunction with their <hi>Capacity;</hi> and as their <hi>Capacity</hi>
is proportioned to their surrounding <hi>Sides;</hi> the <hi>Sides</hi> of those of the
least <hi>Capacity,</hi> being usually as thick, as those of the greatest: so that
suppose Ten lesser, to lye within the compass of One greater; the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi>
of these altogether, would scarce be equal to half the <hi>Content</hi> of
than One.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:100350:17"/>
25. §. Also their <hi>Consistence; scil:</hi> of so many of them as are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminable
by Touch; in being Soft or Hard; Thin or Thick; Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>laginous,
Gummous, Glutinous, Friable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And these in their several
Degrees; in which there is a Variety, as in the <hi>Milks</hi> of some <hi>Plants,</hi> which
are more <hi>Dilute,</hi> than that of others: <hi>Mucilages;</hi> which in some, are
very thick and <hi>Viscous,</hi> in others, more diluted and coming nearer to
a <hi>watry Sap.</hi> And by This, to be compared in the same manner, as
by their <hi>Quantity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>26. §. Likewise their <hi>Colours, Smells,</hi> and <hi>Tastes:</hi> The general
and particular Kinds of all which should be noted. And to what <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Parts,</hi> and in what Variety, they appertain. So most <hi>Resinous
Gumms</hi> are Tinctur'd, some, not; as that which drops from the <hi>Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
Pine,</hi> is as clear as Rock-water. The <hi>Milks</hi> of some <hi>Plants</hi> are
<hi>Paler,</hi> as in <hi>Burdock;</hi> of other <hi>Whiter,</hi> as in <hi>Dandelyon, Scorzonera;
Citrine,</hi> as in the Root of <hi>Trachelium, Angelica; Yellow,</hi> as in <hi>Lovage.</hi> In
some <hi>Plants, Odorous,</hi> as in <hi>Umbelliferous;</hi> in others not, as in <hi>Cichora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous.</hi>
That of Little <hi>Maple, Tastless;</hi> of Garden <hi>Chervil, Sweet;</hi> of
<hi>Fenil, Hot;</hi> of <hi>Scorzonera, Astringent;</hi> of <hi>Dandelion, Bitter;</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
in other <hi>Plants;</hi> but with many Degrees of Strength, and in
conjunction with other <hi>Tasts.</hi> But most <hi>Mucilages,</hi> have little either
<hi>Colour, Taste,</hi> or <hi>Smell;</hi> and the like. Here also the same <hi>Qualities</hi> are
to be inquired into, as, in general speaking, they are said to belong to
a <hi>Vegetable.</hi> Since it is more than probable, that all <hi>Colours</hi> (excepting
<hi>White,</hi> which is sometimes common both to <hi>Containing</hi> and <hi>Contained
Parts)</hi> all <hi>Odours,</hi> and <hi>Tastes,</hi> which are more immediately, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a resolution of their <hi>Essential Principles,</hi> perceptible in a <hi>Plant;</hi> are
not ascribable either to the <hi>Organical,</hi> or <hi>Containing Parts;</hi> but only
to Those, Contained in them; as from divers reasons hereafter may
appear.</p>
               <p>27. §. And <hi>first,</hi> their <hi>Colours;</hi> where, with respect to several
<hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Parts,</hi> they are more <hi>Changeable;</hi> as Red, in <hi>Flowers;</hi> or
<hi>Constant,</hi> as Green, in <hi>Leaves.</hi> Which, with respect to several Ages
of one <hi>Part,</hi> are more <hi>fading,</hi> as Green in <hi>Fruits;</hi> or <hi>durable,</hi> as Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in <hi>Flowers,</hi> In what <hi>Parts</hi> more <hi>Single,</hi> as always in the <hi>Seed;</hi>
or more <hi>Compounded,</hi> as in the <hi>Flower;</hi> and in what <hi>Plants</hi> more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
as in <hi>Pancy.</hi> Which proper to <hi>Plants</hi> that have such a <hi>Taste</hi>
or <hi>Smell,</hi> as both, in <hi>White Flowers,</hi> are usually less strong. To <hi>Plants</hi>
that flower in such a <hi>Season,</hi> as a <hi>Yellow Flower,</hi> I think, chiefly, to
<hi>Spring Plants.</hi> And to <hi>Plants</hi> that are natural to such a <hi>Soil</hi> or <hi>Seat,</hi>
as to <hi>Water-plants,</hi> more usually, a <hi>white Flower.</hi> What, amongst all
<hi>Colours,</hi> more Common to <hi>Plants,</hi> as <hi>Green;</hi> or more Rare, as <hi>Black.</hi> And
what all these Varieties of <hi>Colours</hi> are upon <hi>Cultivation,</hi> but chiefly,
in their natural <hi>Soil.</hi> To observe also with their superficial <hi>Colours,</hi>
those within: so the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Docks,</hi> are <hi>Yellow;</hi> of <hi>Bistort, Red;</hi>
of <hi>Avens,</hi> Purple; but of most, White. Where the Inward, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial
<hi>Colours</hi> agree; as in the <hi>Leaves;</hi> or vary, as in the other Parts
frequently. And in what manner they are <hi>Situated;</hi> some universally
spreading, others running only along with the <hi>Vessels,</hi> as in the <hi>Leaves</hi> of
Red <hi>Dock,</hi> and the <hi>Flowers</hi> of <hi>Wood-Sorrel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>28. §. Next their <hi>Odours;</hi> what may be their principal <hi>Seat;</hi>
whether one or divers <hi>Seats</hi> in the same <hi>Plant.</hi> What the chief <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
out of which they are continually bred. What similitude betwixt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100350:17"/>
the <hi>Smells</hi> of divers <hi>Vegetables;</hi> as betwixt <hi>Baume,</hi> and a <hi>Limon;</hi> the
Green <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Meadow-sweet,</hi> and the green Rinds of <hi>Walnuts.</hi> Or
betwixt those of <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Animals;</hi> as the <hi>Smell</hi> of green and well-grown
<hi>Carduus,</hi> is like to that rank <hi>scent, ab aliquorum axillis spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranti.</hi>
Which have a more sensible <hi>Smell;</hi> as most have; and which
have less, as <hi>Corn.</hi> Where the green <hi>Leaf</hi> is the most Fragrant <hi>Part,</hi>
as in <hi>Musk-Cranesbill;</hi> where the <hi>Flower,</hi> as in <hi>Roses;</hi> the <hi>Root,</hi> as in
sweet <hi>Calamus.</hi> Where all the <hi>Parts</hi> have some <hi>Odour,</hi> where some, or
one, only; as in <hi>Scurvy-grass,</hi> only the <hi>Flowers,</hi> unless the <hi>Leaves</hi> are
bruis'd; and in <hi>Arum,</hi> the <hi>Pestil</hi> only; for neither the <hi>Leaf,</hi> nor <hi>Root</hi>
hath any <hi>Smell,</hi> unless cut; but this is strong enough, not much unlike
to <hi>Humane Excrements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>29. §. But especially their <hi>Tastes,</hi> which it much importeth us
more precisely to distinguish; <hi>First,</hi> by their general <hi>Kinds;</hi> for the
number, even of these, may be computed greater than usually it is. I
remember not, that <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Acritude,</hi> with respect to <hi>Taste,</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished;
yet <hi>Arum-Root</hi> is very <hi>Pungent,</hi> without any proper
<hi>Heat;</hi> and <hi>Cloves,</hi> are very <hi>Hot,</hi> without any proper <hi>Pungency.</hi> So
the White <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Yarrow,</hi> have a <hi>Taste,</hi> hardly any other way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible,
than by causing a gentle <hi>glowing</hi> and <hi>continued Warmth</hi> upon
the Tongue. Also their <hi>Respondencies</hi> one to another; as that of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doary,</hi>
and of the lesser <hi>Cardamoms,</hi> is somewhat like to <hi>Camphire.</hi>
Likewise their <hi>Degrees;</hi> in which there is a great latitude, and may
be extended from <hi>One</hi> to <hi>Ten,</hi> or with easie distinction, from <hi>One</hi> to
<hi>Five:</hi> So the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Sorrel,</hi> is Bitter in the <hi>first;</hi> of <hi>Dock,</hi> in the
<hi>second;</hi> of <hi>Dog-Rose,</hi> in the <hi>third;</hi> of <hi>Dandelyon,</hi> in the <hi>fourth;</hi> of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi>
in the <hi>fifth:</hi> observing them, not only as they vary in several
<hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> but the several <hi>Species</hi> of one, as in <hi>Cichory, Hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed,
Dandelyon.</hi> And then their <hi>Compositions;</hi> for <hi>Tastes</hi> are as truly
<hi>conjunct</hi> in one <hi>Part,</hi> as <hi>Colours:</hi> by which, the latitude is still greater;
In that all Kinds of <hi>Tastes,</hi> in all their Degrees, and in differing Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
may be variously Compounded together: For the most part,
<hi>Two,</hi> as in the <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>sharp-pointed Dock, Astringent,</hi> and <hi>Sowre;</hi>
in <hi>Sorrel-Roots, Astringent</hi> and <hi>Bitter;</hi> and in <hi>Aloes, Bitter</hi> and <hi>Sweet;</hi>
the one in the <hi>fifth,</hi> the other, in the <hi>first Degree;</hi> as upon an unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
tryal may be perceived: and yet more evidently in the <hi>Gall</hi>
of any <hi>Land-Animal.</hi> Sometimes <hi>three,</hi> as in <hi>Agrimony, Bitter, Rough,</hi>
and <hi>Sowrish;</hi> and in <hi>Agarick, Bitter, Rough,</hi> and <hi>Sweet.</hi> And sometimes,
perhaps more. The Sensible distinctions of all which, may lye almost
as wide, as of <hi>Plants</hi> themselves. Wherefore, although it may be
thought rashness, to take away the distinctions of <hi>Hot, Cold, Moist,
Dry, Thin, Gross,</hi> and other <hi>Qualities,</hi> in their several Degree, which
the <hi>Ancients</hi> have affixed to particular <hi>Plants:</hi> yet since they have
done it, to many of them, with much uncertainty; and that, withal,
they are, more properly, the <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> than their
<hi>Qualites;</hi> Practical Observation, may therefore approve it useful, to
add these Sensible Ones of various <hi>Tastes,</hi> precisely distinguishing their
<hi>Conjugations</hi> and <hi>Degrees.</hi> Lastly, their several Varieties and Mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
with respect to the Subject wherein they reside, should also be
noted, As, of all <hi>Tastes</hi> found in <hi>Plants, Bitter</hi> and <hi>Sowr,</hi> are most
common; <hi>Sweet</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> most rare. Which latter, is not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
in some <hi>Sea-Plants;</hi> but upon some others, as upon the fresh
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100350:18"/>
                  <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Tamarisk;</hi> which being licked while they grow, or when
immediately gathered, are plainly <hi>Saltish.</hi> How they vary with the
<hi>Age</hi> of the <hi>Plant,</hi> or <hi>Part;</hi> as the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Radishes,</hi> growing up to
<hi>Seed,</hi> lose the strength of their <hi>Tast;</hi> so most <hi>Fruits</hi> are first <hi>Sowre,</hi>
then <hi>Sweet.</hi> What proper to the several <hi>Parts</hi> of any one <hi>Plant;</hi> so
the <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Wormwood</hi> are extraordinary <hi>Bitter;</hi> the <hi>Root</hi> scarcely
so at all; of an <hi>Hot,</hi> but quite different <hi>Taste.</hi> What more Common, or
Rare, to any <hi>Part;</hi> so no <hi>Root</hi> that I ever tasted, is <hi>Sowre.</hi> And how
they Alternate in several <hi>Plants;</hi> as the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Stock-July-flower</hi> is
biting, not the <hi>Leaves;</hi> on the contrary, the <hi>Leaves</hi> of the <hi>Water-Arsmart,</hi>
are <hi>Biting;</hi> but not the <hi>Root;</hi> and the like. To which we
may add the difference of Time wherein the <hi>Tastes</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
as those of <hi>Arum,</hi> and <hi>Rape-Crowfoot,</hi> are both <hi>Biting;</hi> but
that of the first, as it is slowly perceived, so it continues long; that of
the other, quickly comes, and quickly goes.</p>
               <p>30. §. Amongst the other Adjuncts of the <hi>Contained Parts,</hi> though
not of these only, the <hi>Faculties</hi> of <hi>Vegetables</hi> are to be reputed. For
so the <hi>Rosin</hi> of <hi>Jalap,</hi> which is Purgative, is as truly contained in the
<hi>Organical Parts</hi> of that <hi>Root,</hi> as Blood is in <hi>Veins:</hi> It will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
therefore to make particular observation of these also. And first,
what <hi>Faculties</hi> chiefly may reside in <hi>Plants,</hi> above others: so there is
none of known use in <hi>Salivation,</hi> except by holding in the mouth:
Although we may ask, Why some amongst them, may not (being Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
inwardly) have a power to evacuate by This, as well as other Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ways? Where the <hi>Faculty</hi> is more universally spread over all the
<hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Vegetable,</hi> as in <hi>Asarum.</hi> Where belonging chiefly or wholly
to any particular <hi>Parts</hi> or <hi>Part;</hi> as chiefly to the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Rhubarb;</hi>
and only to the true and proper <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Barbado Nuts.</hi> Whether some
<hi>Faculties,</hi> may be proper to some <hi>Parts</hi> especially. What conjunction
they may have with any sensible <hi>Qualities.</hi> So, many <hi>Purgers,</hi> are not
only <hi>Resinous</hi> and <hi>Gummous;</hi> But also <hi>Mucilaginous;</hi> as <hi>Bryony,</hi> wild
<hi>Cucumer, Lapathum Sativum;</hi> and therefore probably <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> when
growing; <hi>Mallows, Violets, &amp;c.</hi> Such as are Purging and Vomitory,
though some of them have a strong <hi>Taste,</hi> yet the greater part, and of
those, many of the stronger sort, have no <hi>Taste,</hi> or not Great; as
<hi>Senna, Jalap, Scammony, Hellebore, Asarum,</hi> and others. Amongst
which, although <hi>Hellebore</hi> hath a very <hi>Durable Taste,</hi> yet is it not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>High</hi> or <hi>Great.</hi> So also, those that are most sensibly tasted, are, I
think, for the most part, more or less <hi>Bitter;</hi> either simply, as <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthis;</hi>
or <hi>Bitter, Astringent,</hi> as <hi>Rhubarb;</hi> or <hi>Bitter</hi> and <hi>Sweet,</hi> as
<hi>Aloe;</hi> or <hi>Bitter, Astringent,</hi> and <hi>Sweet,</hi> as <hi>Agarick.</hi> Few are <hi>Hot,</hi> as
<hi>Iris.</hi> Or <hi>simply</hi> Sweet. And though some may be Subacid, that are
Mollifying or Lenitive, yet no proper Purge or Vomit is <hi>Sowre.</hi> Such
<hi>Plants</hi> as are of a soft and sweetish <hi>Taste,</hi> without Viscosity, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
good <hi>Antiscorbuticks,</hi> especially against the <hi>Sea,</hi> or other <hi>Salt-Scurvey;</hi>
as are good sweet Pease: And sometimes the <hi>Water</hi> or <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
of the <hi>Shells;</hi> which may easily be drawn from them, being first
duly fermented, and hath a true <hi>Vinous Taste;</hi> but very mild, and not
unpleasant. Those <hi>Plants,</hi> whose Parts are not only <hi>Hot</hi> but <hi>Volatile,</hi>
as <hi>Onions,</hi> are generally good for <hi>Burns.</hi> Such as have a <hi>Balsamick
Taste</hi> or <hi>Smell,</hi> with a little <hi>Astringency,</hi> as <hi>Hypericum, Golden-Rod,
Lamium Luteum, &amp;c.</hi> the best <hi>Wound-Herbs.</hi> And such as are gently

luteus,</hi> Safron, Sulphur, Opium, all <hi>Anodyne</hi> and <hi>Yellow.</hi> How
likewise their <hi>Faculties</hi> and <hi>Qualities</hi> may vary their Degrees, either
differently or together: so <hi>Aloe</hi> and <hi>Colocynthis,</hi> are both <hi>Bitter</hi> in the
highest Degree; yet <hi>Aloe,</hi> which is also <hi>Sweet,</hi> Purgeth more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately;
<hi>Colocynthis,</hi> which is <hi>Bitter,</hi> but not <hi>Sweet,</hi> most Violently. How
far the <hi>Faculties</hi> of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> as well as their <hi>Qualities,</hi> may be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded;
where, and which chiefly; as Astrictive and Purgative in
<hi>Rhabarb.</hi> Where this Question may be put, Whether divers other,
and yet more extreme <hi>Faculties,</hi> as well as these of Astrictive and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
may not somewhere or other be also found, or made, to meet:
whereby the same <hi>Plant,</hi> or some <hi>Preparation</hi> of it, may be most Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and yet most Innocent; the <hi>Malignity</hi> thereof exerting its Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and the <hi>Virtue</hi> its Soveraignty at the same time. And lastly, what
<hi>Affinity</hi> there may be betwixt them; as most <hi>Plants,</hi> that are strong
Purgatives, and especially Vomitories, I think, are also <hi>Sternutatory;</hi>
as white <hi>Hellebore, Jalap, Tobacco:</hi> and on the contrary, such as are
<hi>Sternutatory,</hi> are some of the most proper and most potent <hi>Medicines</hi>

               <p>31. §. Thus far a particular observation of the <hi>Qualities</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi>
of the <hi>Contents</hi> of <hi>Vegetables</hi> may proceed, as they are existent
in their <hi>Natural Estate.</hi> From which, although some probable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
may be made, of their Material and Formal <hi>Essences,</hi> and of the
<hi>Causes</hi> of their determinate Varieties, or the <hi>Modes</hi> of <hi>Vegetation</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
thereunto: yet will our Conceptions hereof be more facile, clear,
and comprehensive, if by all other Ways of Observation, they be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
examined, according as <hi>Experiment</hi> may be applicable to any of
them.</p>
               <p>32. §. As by <hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>usion;</hi> so some <hi>Plants</hi> give their <hi>Smell,</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Rubbing, or not so well; as the green <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Stramonium, Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vygrass,</hi>
and many more: others lose it by Rubbing, as the <hi>flowers</hi> of
<hi>Violets, Carnations, Borage, &amp;c.</hi> others yield it both ways, as <hi>Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,
&amp;c.</hi> So some <hi>Apples</hi> mend their <hi>Taste,</hi> by Scoaping, and <hi>Pears</hi>
by Rowling, especially that called the <hi>Rowling Pear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>33. §. By <hi>Agitation;</hi> which doth that, sometimes, by Force, which
<hi>Digestion,</hi> doth by Heat: so any cold <hi>Oyl</hi> and a <hi>Syrup</hi> being, in a due
manner, agitated together, of two Fluid bodies will become one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent,
as is known.</p>
               <p>34. §. By <hi>Frigifaction;</hi> how far the <hi>Juyces</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
or within them, may be any of them, or some more than others, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to <hi>Cold:</hi> and thereby to be deprived of their <hi>Motion</hi> or natural
<hi>Consistence,</hi> or may suffer alteration in their <hi>Colour, Taste,</hi> or <hi>Smell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>35. §. By <hi>Infusion;</hi> where I mean <hi>Infusion</hi> only in Common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
So both <hi>Cassia Lignea,</hi> and <hi>Cinnamon</hi> are a little Mucilaginous;
but the former most. Some of the <hi>Contents</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> may be wholly
dissolved in Common Water; some but in part, others not at all; or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little; which is proper to some <hi>Milks,</hi> as well as <hi>Gums.</hi> The <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
Smells</hi> or <hi>Tastes</hi> they hereupon yield, are found various; and in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100350:19"/>
some very unexpected: So the green <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Bawm,</hi> being duly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
in common Water, without any other Body added, tincture it
with a clear and deep Red, near that of <hi>Claret Wine,</hi> as I have often
tryed.</p>
               <p>36. §. By <hi>Subsiding;</hi> So the Juyce of <hi>Sorrel,</hi> being ordered as that
of <hi>Grapes,</hi> will, in time, let fall a kind of <hi>Tartar</hi> or <hi>Essential Salt.</hi> And
so perhaps will that of many other <hi>Plants,</hi> without any previous <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction;</hi>
although that be commonly thought to be necessary.</p>
               <p>37. §. By <hi>Digestion</hi> with <hi>Fermentation;</hi> either of the entire <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables,</hi>
or of the <hi>Juyces,</hi> or other <hi>Contents;</hi> and these by themselves,
or with common Water. And hereby to note, what difference may
be in the Strength, Celerity, or Continuance of the <hi>Fermentation.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
how their <hi>Qualities</hi> may thereby be altered; as the Smell of <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let-flowers,</hi>
from a most excellent <hi>Fragrancy,</hi> may, by <hi>Digestion,</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to an odious and abominable <hi>Stink,</hi> like that of the black Mud
of <hi>Gutters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>38. §. By <hi>Digestion</hi> with <hi>Calefaction;</hi> so the <hi>Colour</hi> of the <hi>Juyce</hi>
of <hi>Limons,</hi> from Transparency (if that be a Colour) may be turned
to a perfect Red. Whence it is that many are deceived in the <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
called the <hi>Tincture</hi> of <hi>Corals;</hi> supposing the <hi>Corals</hi> to give the
<hi>Menstruum</hi> its Colour. Whereas the <hi>Menstruum</hi> will obtain it, only
by <hi>Digestion,</hi> without any <hi>Corals,</hi> mixed with it.</p>
               <p>39. §. By <hi>Decoction;</hi> either of <hi>Vegetables</hi> themselves, or of their
<hi>Liquors;</hi> and to observe what alterations follow. So <hi>Turpentine</hi> boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
becometh friable; <hi>Sugar, Bitter,</hi> and of a Brown Red. <hi>Turneps</hi> lose
their Biting <hi>Taste; Onions,</hi> their Picquancy; yet neither of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
those self same <hi>Qualities</hi> to the Water. The same may be observed
in the <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Sweet-Fennel-seeds, Aniseeds,</hi> and others, losing
much of their <hi>Tastes</hi> themselves, and yet conveying very little of them
to the <hi>Liquors</hi> wherein they are boiled; the greater portion of their
Volatile parts, and so their <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Taste</hi> therewith, flying away.
Whereof therefore it is much better to make an <hi>Emulsion,</hi> than to <hi>decoct</hi>
them; or to make an <hi>Emulsion</hi> from them, with their own <hi>Decoction,</hi>
especially if the <hi>Medicine</hi> be intended to be <hi>Carminative,</hi> as I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
observed. The <hi>Decoction</hi> should also be carried on through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all degrees to that of an <hi>Extract;</hi> by which the <hi>Qualities</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
sometimes, are much altered; as the <hi>Colour</hi> of all or most green <hi>Leaves,</hi>
from a kind of Yellow, deepens at last into a dark one, as Black as
Pitch.</p>
               <p>40. §. By <hi>Distillations;</hi> both with the cold <hi>Still, Alembick, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and open <hi>Furnace:</hi> and to note what <hi>Vegetables</hi> thus give their
<hi>Smell</hi> or <hi>Taste,</hi> and in what Degrees of strength, either under, or over
their natural ones; as <hi>Mint, Pennyroyal,</hi> and the like, which are <hi>Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick</hi>
and <hi>Hot,</hi> give their <hi>Tastes</hi> perfect: but <hi>Wormwood,</hi> which is
<hi>Aromatick</hi> and <hi>Bitter;</hi> gives it but by halfs, pretty fully as <hi>Aromatick,</hi> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
as <hi>Bitter.</hi> And <hi>Carduus,</hi> though also so exceeding <hi>Bitter,</hi> yet not
being <hi>Aromatick,</hi> yieldeth a much weaker <hi>Taste.</hi> Also what <hi>Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>
yield <hi>Oyl</hi> most plentifully; and what difference may be in those
<hi>Oyls,</hi> as to their <hi>Colour, Weight,</hi> or otherwise; as that of <hi>Cloves</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Red; of <hi>Cinnamon,</hi> limpid; both Ponderous. So to distil <hi>Juices,
Gums,</hi> or other <hi>Contents,</hi> with an hot <hi>fire;</hi> and to see, what Bodies they
yield, and of what <hi>Qualities;</hi> as <hi>Turpentine</hi> is known to yield, besides
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100350:19"/>
its <hi>Oyl,</hi> a subacid <hi>Water; Vinegar,</hi> an Eager <hi>Spirit;</hi> as that part may
be called, which <hi>Chymists</hi> are wont to call the <hi>Phlegm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>41. §. By <hi>Arefaction;</hi> so <hi>Milks</hi> which are Liquid, and White in
their Natural Estate, in Standing, grow Gummous, Yellow, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
different, so doth that of <hi>Scorzonera;</hi> and that of <hi>Fenil</hi> becomes a
Balsamical, but Limpid <hi>Oyl.</hi> The <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Angelica,</hi> being dry'd, and
cut by the length, exhibit their small <hi>Veins</hi> fill'd with an Aromatick
<hi>Rosin.</hi> In the whiter parts of <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> is gathered a kind of <hi>Saline
Concret;</hi> by which, this <hi>Root,</hi> in chewing, seems as if it were a little
gritty. <hi>Cabbage-Stalks,</hi> sliced, and laid in the Shade to dry, gather on
them a kind of <hi>Nitrous</hi> Hoar. <hi>Raisins</hi> and <hi>Corins</hi> contain, not only
a sweet Juyce, but also a true <hi>Sugar,</hi> which lies <hi>curdled</hi> in the <hi>Pulp,</hi>
as the more <hi>Saline</hi> parts do in Green Soap. And the like is gather'd
on the out-side of a <hi>Fig;</hi> saving, that it is more <hi>Nitrous,</hi> as lying next
the <hi>Aer.</hi> The <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Arum,</hi> upon drying, lose much of the strength
of their <hi>Taste;</hi> but the contrary may be noted of many other <hi>Roots,</hi>
which, upon drying, increase it. Some, being cut and laid by, change
their Natural <hi>Colours,</hi> into Red, Purple, Yellow, Green, or White;
as <hi>Liquorish,</hi> into White, in some places; and <hi>Peony,</hi> into Red: and
sometimes into two; as <hi>Patience,</hi> into Yellow and Red.</p>
               <p>42. §. By <hi>Assation;</hi> thus <hi>Apples,</hi> by roasting, eat more Sowre. The
<hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Horse-Radish,</hi> toasted, tasteth like a <hi>Turnep. Potatoes, Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and many other <hi>Roots,</hi> and <hi>Parts,</hi> have their <hi>Tastes,</hi> either Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or Refracted; which chiefly, and in what manner, should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
There is one alteration, as remarkable, as commonly known;
and is that which followeth upon roasting or baking in one kind of the
<hi>Waldensian Pears,</hi> which, for a <hi>Walden,</hi> we corruptly call a <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>43. §. By <hi>Ustion;</hi> wherein some <hi>Plants,</hi> or <hi>Parts</hi> of them, burn
very quietly; others, not without violent motions; so <hi>Fenil-Seeds,</hi>
held in the flame of a Candle, will spit and spurtle, like the <hi>Serum</hi> of
<hi>Blood.</hi> Some <hi>Vegetables</hi> lose their <hi>Smell,</hi> as <hi>Roses;</hi> others, keep it,
as <hi>Rosemary;</hi> and others, mend it, as <hi>Lignum Aloes,</hi> To note, not
only the alteration of their <hi>Qualities,</hi> but what they yield; as <hi>Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
which, in <hi>Distillation,</hi> yieldeth <hi>Oyl</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> both limpid; upon
<hi>Ustion,</hi> sheweth nothing but a black <hi>Soot.</hi> So <hi>Benzoine,</hi> by <hi>Distilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Oyl;</hi> by <hi>Ustion,</hi> white <hi>Flowers,</hi> as is known.</p>
               <p>44. §. By <hi>Calcination;</hi> and here to observe, wherein the <hi>Caput
Mortuum</hi> of one, may differ from, or agree in Nature with that of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and also to compare these with those of <hi>Animal Bodies.</hi> As also in
their <hi>Quantities.</hi> And to compare them with what they yield by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation</hi>
and <hi>Ustion</hi> as to both. Thus far they have been tryed <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly,</hi>
or by themselves. They should also be examined,</p>
               <p>45. §. By <hi>Composition;</hi> not only with <hi>Water,</hi> as in simple <hi>Infusions,
&amp;c.</hi> but with any other Bodies, which may have a power of acting
upon them, or upon which, these may have a power to act. And so
to make <hi>Infusions, Destillations, Decoctions, Digestions,</hi> in divers kinds
of <hi>Liquors,</hi> as <hi>Vinegar, Urine, Spirit</hi> of <hi>H. H. Wine, Blood, Milk,</hi>
or others. So in <hi>Infusions,</hi> some Red Colours are heightned by <hi>Acids;</hi>
Blews, turned Purple. So fetid <hi>Spirits</hi> (as of <hi>H. H.)</hi> may be rendred much
more grateful, by being <hi>Rectified,</hi> once or twice, with fresh <hi>Aromaticks,</hi>
To observe also what follows, upon mixing the <hi>Liquors,</hi> or other Parts
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100350:20"/>
of <hi>Plants</hi> together; as <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> by <hi>Digestion</hi> with a <hi>Lixivial
Salt,</hi> extracteth thence a Red <hi>Tincture.</hi> Or with <hi>Salts, Earths, Metals,</hi>
or any other Bodies; as the <hi>Juyce</hi> of the green <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Rasberry, Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose,</hi>
and divers other <hi>Plants</hi> (I think principally such as are Astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent)
expressed upon <hi>Steel,</hi> as it drieth, becometh of a <hi>Purple Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>46. §. Lastly, by <hi>Compounding</hi> the <hi>Experiment</hi> it self, or joyning
two or more of them, upon the same matter: as <hi>Fermentation</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation,</hi>
as is used for some <hi>Waters. Infusion</hi> and <hi>Fermentation,</hi> as in
making of <hi>Beer. Fermentation</hi> and <hi>Coction,</hi> or rather <hi>Assation,</hi> as in
making of <hi>Bread. Arefaction</hi> and <hi>Destillation,</hi> as may be tryed upon
some <hi>Herbs;</hi> and with what difference from what may be noted, upon
their being distilled, moist.</p>
               <p>47. §. Having proceeded thus far, by all the above particular
Ways of Observation; a Comparative Prospect must be taken of them:
by which, at last, the <hi>Communities</hi> and <hi>Differences</hi> of the <hi>Contents</hi> of
<hi>Vegetables,</hi> may be discerned; the manner of their <hi>Causation</hi> and <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi>
partly, be judged of; and wherein it is, that the <hi>Essence</hi> of their
several <hi>Natures</hi> and <hi>Qualities</hi> doth consist, in some measure compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.
And consequently, both from the knowledge of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Natures,</hi> and the Analogy found betwixt them; we may be
able, better to conjecture, and try, what any of them are, or may be
good for. For certainly, we shall then know, more readily, to apply
things unto, and more fitly to prepare them for, their Proper Uses,
when we first know, <hi>what they are.</hi> Notwithstanding, since the <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of <hi>Plants,</hi> do often lie more recluse; it is best, therefore, not wholly
to acquiesce in such Conjectures, as their <hi>Tastes,</hi> or other <hi>Sensible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi>
may suggest; but to subjoyn <hi>Experiment.</hi> In making of which,
and in passing a Judgment thereupon, many Cautions, both in respect
of the <hi>Plant</hi> whereof, and the <hi>Subject</hi> whereupon it is made, are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to be attended. Which yet, in regard they result not so directly
from the Matter at present in hand; I shall not, therefore, here insist
upon them, And thus much for the Third General <hi>Mean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>48. §. THE <hi>Contents</hi> of the <hi>Organical Parts</hi> of <hi>Vegetables,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Fourth General <hi>Mean.</hi>
                  </note> having
been thus duly Examined: it will be requisite to make the like Inquiry,
into their <hi>Principles;</hi> or the <hi>Bodys,</hi> immediately concurrent and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to their Being. And of these, we are to observe, First, their <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi>
whether well reducible to <hi>five, six, seven,</hi> or <hi>more,</hi> or <hi>fewer:</hi> and
the Special Differences observable under any one General; since there
are many Bodies, of very different Natures, confounded under one
Name. Next their <hi>Conjugation;</hi> which they are, that either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or over those observable in <hi>animal,</hi> or other <hi>Bodies,</hi> are here joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together in a <hi>Plant;</hi> How far common to the <hi>Organical Parts</hi>
of divers <hi>Plants;</hi> or to the several <hi>Organical Parts</hi> of one; or
how far different in them. So the predominant <hi>Principle</hi> of the <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymous
Parts</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> that it is an <hi>Acid,</hi> seems evident, From the
general Nature of <hi>Fruits;</hi> and of <hi>Corn;</hi> and most <hi>Parenchymous Roots,</hi>
which are either Spirituous, or Sower, or by Digestion, do easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
such. Likewise their <hi>Proportions;</hi> which stand in the greatest,
which in the least, or in the meaner <hi>Quantities,</hi> and in what Degrees;
both in divers <hi>Vegetables,</hi> and in the several <hi>Organical Parts</hi> of one.
And then the <hi>Concentration</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> of them altogether; as to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100350:20"/>
of their Closeness or Laxity; or the manner of their Implication and
Coherency; or as to their Location, one being more Central, another
more Exposed and Rampant over the rest; or otherwise different. To
examine these <hi>Principles,</hi> by their <hi>Colour, Taste, Smell, Consistence, Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
Volatility, Weight, Figures,</hi> or other <hi>Accidents.</hi> And to these
purposes, to go through the formentioned Ways of <hi>Experiment;</hi> as
<hi>Ustion, Calcination, Destillation, &amp;c.</hi> as any of them may appear ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
hereunto. So the <hi>Essential Salt</hi> of <hi>Wormwood,</hi> which may be
obtained from the <hi>Lixivial;</hi> is <hi>Bitter,</hi> transparent, and commonly, of
a <hi>Cylindrick</hi> figure: whereas that which is obtained by <hi>Coction,</hi> or from
the <hi>Extract,</hi> is <hi>tastless,</hi> greyish, and almost <hi>Cubick:</hi> and that in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
of the Green <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Violets,</hi> appears in fine transparent <hi>Shoots,</hi>
like so many little Needles. And it is probable, That the <hi>Salts</hi> of
most Kinds of <hi>Plants,</hi> whether Lixivial or Essential; and of these, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
obtained by <hi>Decoction,</hi> or otherwise, have either their <hi>Figure,</hi> or
other <hi>Qualities,</hi> proper to themselves, whereby they are all distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one from another. And lastly, to make <hi>Experiment</hi> upon these
<hi>Principles,</hi> mixing them with one another, or with other Bodies, or
otherwise.</p>
               <p>49. §. I know it will be difficult to make observations of this kind
upon the <hi>Organical Parts</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> severally. Yet I have thought of
some Ways, whereby true and undeceivable ones may be made. And
the better to illustrate what I mean, I shall give one or two Instances
of Tryal to this purpose. For the making of which, and some others
of the like nature, I considered, That upon the <hi>Anatomical Analysis</hi> of
all the <hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> I had certainly found, (and shall hereafter
shew) That in all <hi>Plants,</hi> there are <hi>Two, and only Two Organical Parts
Essentially distinct, viz.</hi> The <hi>Pithy Part,</hi> and the <hi>Lignous Part,</hi> or such
others as are analogous to either of These. So that, if we can think
of any <hi>Plants,</hi> which will afford us either of these two, though not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
yet in some good measure, simple and unmixed: We may then
see, by putting them to a <hi>Chymical, Test,</hi> what <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of <hi>Principles,</hi> concur to <hi>specifie</hi> their <hi>Substantial Forms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>50. §. To the <hi>Pithy Part, Starch,</hi> or pure <hi>Manchet</hi> is analogous,
as having very little of the <hi>Lignous</hi> mixed with them. I therefore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<abbr>lb</abbr> ij of <hi>Starch</hi> to be put into a <hi>Retort,</hi> and with a <hi>Receiver</hi> affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to be set in a <hi>Sand Furnace;</hi> and that all it would yield, should,
by degrees, be forced over; which, besides what was evaporated at
the Neck of the <hi>Receiver,</hi> was about <abbr>lb</abbr> j. of an acid and eager <hi>Liquor,</hi>
of a heavy and blackish <hi>Oyl</hi> ℥ ss, and of a light <hi>Oyl</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. The <hi>Caput Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum</hi>
could not be reduced to Ashes, by the strongest heat which a
<hi>naked fire</hi> in that Furnace would produce.</p>
               <p>51. To the <hi>Lignous Part, Hemp</hi> or <hi>Flax</hi> is analogous, having
very little of the <hi>Pithy</hi> mixed with them. I caused therefore <abbr>lb</abbr> ij of
<hi>Flax</hi> to be put into a <hi>Retort,</hi> and manag'd as the <hi>Starch:</hi> whereupon,
it yielded a Liquor, as I remember, somewhat like the former, and
about the same quantity; no <hi>Oyl</hi> which remained liquid, when cold;
but instead of that a <hi>Butyr,</hi> almost of the Consistence and Colour of
the <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Mace;</hi> and of this above ℥ iij, or near six times the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the <hi>Oyl</hi> which was yielded by the <hi>Starch.</hi> The <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi>
being burned to a white <hi>Ash,</hi> yielded some portion of a <hi>Lixivial
Salt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100350:21"/>
52. §. From whence, I shall, at present, only make these two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques;
<hi>First,</hi> That although the chief portion, as to quantity, in
both these <hi>Bodys,</hi> (as in most <hi>Plants)</hi> is an Acid Liquor; yet the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yields also some of an Alkaly, which the other doth not. So that
they are the <hi>Lignous Parts</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> generally, which yield the <hi>Alkalick
Salt,</hi> or at least in the greatest Proportion. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurious
or Oleous Principle,</hi> is also much more predominant in the <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Part,</hi> than in the <hi>Pithy.</hi> To these, the like Tryals upon other
<hi>Plants,</hi> should be added; and other ways. So, in regard the <hi>Soot</hi> of
most <hi>Woods,</hi> yields a <hi>Volatile Alkaly;</hi> it were fit to examine, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Soot</hi> which is made of the <hi>Pithy Parts</hi> and that, of the <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,</hi>
afford the said <hi>Alkaly,</hi> in equal qantity; or whether, as is most
likely, that of the <hi>Lignous</hi> doth afford it in a far greater: and the
like.</p>
               <p>53. §. The prosecution of what is here proposed, will be requisite,
To a fuller and clearer view, of the <hi>Modes</hi> of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> of the <hi>Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Natures</hi> of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> and of their more Recluse <hi>Faculties</hi> and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi>
First, of the <hi>Modes</hi> of <hi>Vegetation.</hi> For suppose we were speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a <hi>Root;</hi> from a due consideration of the <hi>Properties</hi> of any <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical
Part</hi> or <hi>Parts</hi> thereof; 'tis true, that the real and genuine <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
may be rendred, of divers other dependent <hi>Properties,</hi> as spoken ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
of the whole <hi>Root.</hi> But it will be asked again, What may be
the <hi>Causes</hi> of those <hi>first</hi> and Independent ones? Which, if we will
seek, we must do it by inquiring also, What are the <hi>Principles</hi> of those
<hi>Organical Parts?</hi> For it is necessary, that the <hi>Principles</hi> whereof a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
doth consist, should be, if not all of them the <hi>active,</hi> yet the <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citating
Causes,</hi> or such as are called <hi>Causae sine quibus non,</hi> of its becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and being, in all respects, both as to <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Accidents,</hi> what
it is: otherwise, their Existence, in that Body, were altogether su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous;
since it might have been without them: which if so, it
might then have been made of any other; there being no necessity of
putting any difference, if neither those, whereof it is made, are thought
necessary to its Being. Wherefore if we will allow a Body, and so the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical
Parts</hi> of a <hi>Vegetable</hi> to have <hi>Principles,</hi> we must allow these <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
their necessary Use; and that the Shapes or other Properties of the
said <hi>Parts,</hi> are as much dependant upon the <hi>Nature</hi> of These; as is the
Roundness of a Drop of Ink, upon the Fluidity of Water, ingredient
to it.</p>
               <p>54. §. Again, the <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Organical Parts</hi> being known,
we may from thence obtain a further knowledge of the <hi>Natures,</hi> and
<hi>Causation</hi> or <hi>Original</hi> of their <hi>Contents;</hi> since these <hi>Contents</hi> are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
included in the said <hi>Organical Parts,</hi> but also Created by them: and
must needs be so, whether we will suppose the <hi>Principles</hi> of these <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi>
to be prae-existent to their reception thereinto, or not. For, if
not prae-existent, what can be clearer, than that the said <hi>Parts</hi> give
them their Existence? And if prae-existent, yet in regard they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished,
and such only of them admitted in such sort into an <hi>Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Part,</hi> from amongst others, as are apt to combine and mix toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in such a <hi>Form,</hi> and so to constitute such a <hi>Liquor;</hi> it is as clear, that
the Existence, if not of those <hi>Principles,</hi> yet of that <hi>Liquor,</hi> is depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
on the said <hi>Part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:100350:21"/>
55. §. And if by means of the said <hi>Organical Parts,</hi> it is, that their
<hi>Contents</hi> become <hi>such</hi> and <hi>such</hi> peculiar <hi>Mixtures;</hi> it is hence also mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
That, by the same means, they are of <hi>such</hi> distinct <hi>Faculties</hi> and
<hi>Powers:</hi> Because the <hi>Faculty</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> of a Body, lieth not in any of
its <hi>Principles</hi> apart; but is a Resultance from them all; or from their
being, in such peculiar sort and manner, United and Combined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
So the <hi>Principles</hi> of the Purgative Parts of a <hi>Root,</hi> as of <hi>Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb,</hi>
although we should suppose them to be existent in the surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Earth,</hi> yet we cannot say, That <hi>that Earth,</hi> or the <hi>Principles</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
contained, are Purgative; but only that they are such, as by being
combined together, in such a peculiar way, may become <hi>so.</hi> So the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts of a <hi>Clock,</hi> although they are and must be all prae-existent
to it, and it is their <hi>Form,</hi> by which they are, what they are; yet is it
the <hi>setting together</hi> of such <hi>Parts,</hi> and in such a way only, that makes
them a <hi>Clock.</hi> And since we see that the <hi>Mixture</hi> of two Bodies of two
different <hi>Qualities,</hi> as of Two <hi>Colours,</hi> will produce a Third <hi>Colour,</hi>
differing from them both; as Blue and Red, do a Murrey: Why should
not Two or More Bodies of different <hi>Natures,</hi> be so combined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as to produce a Third <hi>Nature?</hi> Or wherefore may not that be
allowed to be performed by <hi>Nature,</hi> which by Artificial Compounding
of <hi>Medicines,</hi> or other Bodies, is designed, and oftentimes effected? I'll
give but one Instance; <hi>Water, Grease,</hi> and an <hi>Alcalizate Salt,</hi> may be
easily so ordered as to be invested with new <hi>Qualities, Nature,</hi> and
<hi>Powers;</hi> the <hi>Salt,</hi> to lose its extreme fiery Pungent <hi>Taste;</hi> the <hi>Tallow,</hi> its
<hi>Smell;</hi> and being before unsociable with the <hi>Water,</hi> to mingle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
neither <hi>Tallow, Salt,</hi> nor <hi>Water</hi> alone, will fetch out a spot of
<hi>Grease;</hi> but all united easily do it: the same Three Bodys united, are,
in some Cases, as in the <hi>Jaundies,</hi> no ill <hi>Medicine;</hi> any of which, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
alone, may rather prove prejudicial, than a cure: and all this done,
only by duly boiling them together into one Body, which we call
<hi>Sope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>56. §. Whence again, if it be such an <hi>Union,</hi> and <hi>Proportion,</hi> of
such a <hi>Sort</hi> of <hi>Principles,</hi> which produceth such a <hi>Faculty;</hi> and that
we may, by any means, come to know what these are; we may, possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
also attain to the knowledge of such <hi>Rules,</hi> whereby any kind of
<hi>Faculty</hi> may be made; as to Compound such Bodies, which are neither
Purgative nor Vomitory, so together, as to be Invested with those <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</hi>
And if to Make them, then consequently, to Mend, Exalt,
Strengthen, and Enoble them, with greater ease and certainty. And thus
much for the Fourth General <hi>Mean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>57. §. HITHERTO, We have considered the <hi>Materials</hi> of a <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Fifth General <hi>Mean.</hi>
                  </note>
only as Ingredient to it: there yet remains a <hi>Fifth Story</hi> to be
ascended; which is, to consider these <hi>Materials</hi> as they are derived
from <hi>abroad:</hi> or as, after they are received and naturalized, they may,
with others yet abroad, have any kind of correspondence. And these
are <hi>Four</hi> in general, <hi>scil. Earth, Water, Aer,</hi> and <hi>Sun;</hi> all which, in
that they contribute so universally to <hi>Vegetation,</hi> and to whatsoever is
contained in a <hi>Vegetable,</hi> it is therefore requisite, that of These likewise,
Particular Observation should be made.</p>
               <p>58. §. And First, of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and of all Solid Receptacles of
<hi>Plants.</hi> Where we are to consider their several <hi>Kinds;</hi> as Mellow,
Sandy, Clayie, Chalky, and others. Their <hi>Ingredients;</hi> as Rank and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100350:22"/>
Mellow <hi>Earth,</hi> with Sand, or with Clay; or Sand with Clay; or alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
and in what Proportions. The <hi>Principles</hi> whereinto any one
of these <hi>Ingredients,</hi> separated from the rest, and put to the Test of
<hi>Distillation, Ustion, Calcination,</hi> or other, either alone, or by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with other Bodies, may be Resolved. And by their <hi>Qualities,</hi> as
<hi>Colour, Smell, Taste, &amp;c.</hi> both <hi>Ingredients</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
To make tryal of the growth of <hi>Plants,</hi> in all kinds of <hi>simple
Soils;</hi> either <hi>Earthy or Mineral,</hi> as Clay, Marl, Oker, Fullers Earth,
Bole Armeniac, Vitriol, Allum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or <hi>Vegetable,</hi> as Rotten Wood,
Brans, Starch, or Flower, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or <hi>Animal,</hi> as Dungs, pounded Flesh,
dried and powdered Blood, and the like; that it may appear, how far
any of these may contribute to the growth of a <hi>Plant;</hi> or to one, above
another.</p>
               <p>59. §. Next of the <hi>Water,</hi> and of all Liquid Receptacles. Where
the several kinds of <hi>Water,</hi> from Wells, Springs, Rain, and Rivers are,
by their <hi>Qualities</hi> and <hi>Faculties,</hi> to be examined; as these, and by
these, their <hi>Principles,</hi> either in their Natural State, or upon Digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or otherwise, may be observable: since Common <hi>Water</hi> it self, is
undoubtedly compounded of several <hi>Principles;</hi> the simplicity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
not being argued, from its Clearness and Transparency; for a Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Alum,</hi> though it containeth a considerable quantity of <hi>Earth,</hi>
is yet very Clear: nor from its seeming to have neither <hi>Smell</hi> nor <hi>Taste;</hi>
for <hi>Water-drinkers</hi> will tell you of the varieties of both in different
<hi>Waters.</hi> Besides, if these <hi>Qualities</hi> should be accounted rather Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
than Sense; the difference of <hi>Waters</hi> is yet more manifest, from
their different Effects, observed by <hi>Cooks, Laundresses, Brewers,</hi> and
others, that have occasion to use them: for not to mix with <hi>Sope,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
curdling; not to boil Meat tender, or without colouring it red;
and the like, are the vices of some <hi>Waters,</hi> not of others, which yet
would seem, in Colour, Taste, and Smell, to be the same. Tryal should
also be made of the growth of <hi>Plants</hi> in all kinds of Liquid Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
as <hi>Common Water, Snow Water, Sea Water, Urine, Milk, Whey,
Wine, Oyl, Ink, &amp;c.</hi> Or any of these, with a solution of <hi>Salt, Nitre,
Sal prunellae, Sope,</hi> or other body. And hereby to observe what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
either in the <hi>Liquor,</hi> or in the <hi>Plant</hi> it self: as if any <hi>fixed</hi> Body,
being weighed before its dissolution in <hi>Water;</hi> and if the <hi>Plant,</hi> set herein,
groweth; the <hi>Water,</hi> being then evaporated; whether the quantity of that
dissolved body, continue the same, or is lessened. So, whether any <hi>Vegetable</hi>
will become <hi>Opiate,</hi> by growing a considerable time in a plain Solution or
Water-tincture of <hi>Opium;</hi> and the like. Which <hi>Experiments,</hi> what event
soever they have, yet at least, for our further instruction in the <hi>Nature</hi>
of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> may be of use.</p>
               <p>60. §. Next of <hi>Aer,</hi> where it will be requisite to inquire, what sort
of Bodies may be herein contained: It being probable, from the variety
of <hi>Meteors</hi> formed herein; and of <hi>Vapours</hi> and <hi>Exhalations</hi> continually
advanced hereinto; that some or other of them, may bear an Analogy,
to all Volatile Bodys, whether <hi>Animal, Vegetable,</hi> or <hi>Mineral.</hi> The flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishings
also of <hi>Frozen Dew;</hi> and the Green Colour, which the <hi>Aer</hi>
gives the Ground or Water, when, for some time exposed to it; and
other effects; seem to argue, that it is Impregnated with <hi>Vegetable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
To consider also the peculiar Nature of that Body, which is strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called, <hi>Aer,</hi> And of that true <hi>Aerial Salt,</hi> which to me, seemeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100350:22"/>
that it is dissolved in the <hi>Aether,</hi> as other <hi>salts</hi> are in <hi>Water,</hi> or in
the Vaporous parts of the <hi>Aer.</hi> As also to try, what different Effects, a
diversity of <hi>Aer</hi> may have upon a <hi>Vegetable;</hi> as by setting a <hi>Plant,</hi> or <hi>Seed,</hi>
either exceeding Low, as at the bottom of a deep Well; or exceeding
High, as on the top of a Steeple. Or else by exposing some <hi>Soil</hi> to the
<hi>Aer,</hi> which is assuredly free from any <hi>Seed,</hi> and so, as no <hi>Seed</hi> can light
upon it; and to observe, whether the <hi>Aer</hi> hath a power of producing
a <hi>Vegetable</hi> therein, or not: and the like.</p>
               <p>61. §. Lastly of the <hi>Sun;</hi> as to which, it may be considered, What
Influence it may have upon the <hi>Plant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> it self; upon the <hi>Soil;</hi> Or upon
the <hi>Aer.</hi> Whether that <hi>Influence</hi> is any thing else besides Heat: or may
differ from that of a <hi>Fire,</hi> otherwise, than by being Temperate, and
more Equal. That it doth, seems evident from an <hi>Experiment</hi> sometime
since given us, in one of the <hi>Parisian Journals des Scavans,</hi> and which I
therefore think very applicable to our present purpose. If you hold a
<hi>Concave</hi> at a due distance, against a Fire, it will collect and cast the Heat
into a burning <hi>Focus:</hi> but if you put a peice of plain Glass between
them, the Glass will scatter the Heat, and destroy the <hi>Focus.</hi> Whereas
the <hi>Sun-Beams,</hi> being gathered in like manner, will pass through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed
Glass, and maintain their <hi>Focus.</hi> As for That, of the Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Sun-beams,</hi> by the help of <hi>Glasses,</hi> in the form of a <hi>Magistery,</hi>
or of <hi>Flowers,</hi> and such like, I desire to suspend my thoughts of them,
till I see them. I will only say thus much further at present, That I do
not understand why the <hi>Sun</hi> should not have some Influence upon Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
besides by Heat, if it may be granted, That the <hi>Moon</hi> hath; for
which, it should seem, there are some good Arguments.</p>
               <p>62. §. WE HAVE thus far examined the <hi>Principles</hi> necessary to
<hi>Vegetation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Sixth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Mean.</hi> Only hinted.</note> The <hi>Question</hi> may be put once more, In what manner are
these <hi>Principles</hi> so adapted, as to become capable of being assembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
in such a <hi>Number, Conjugation, Proportion,</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> as to
make a <hi>Vegetable Body?</hi> For the comprehension whereof, we must also
know, What are the <hi>Principles</hi> of these <hi>Principles.</hi> Which, although they
lie in so great an abyss of obscurity; yet, I think, I have some reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that they are not altogether undiscoverable. How far they may
be so, I am so far from Determining, that I shall not now Conjecture.</p>
               <p>63. §. THIS is the <hi>Design,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> and these the <hi>Means</hi> I propose in order
thereunto. To which, I suppose, they may all appear to be necessary.
For what we obtain of <hi>Nature,</hi> we must not do it by commanding, but
by courting of Her. Those that woo Her, may possibly have her for
their Wife; but She is not so common, as to prostitute her self to the
best behaved <hi>Wit,</hi> which only practiseth upon it self, and is not appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to her. I mean, that where ever Men will go beyond Phansie and
Imagination, depending upon the Conduct of <hi>Divine Wisdom,</hi> they must
Labour, Hope and Persevere. And as the <hi>Means</hi> propounded, are all
necessary, so they may, in some measure, prove effectual. How far, I
promise not; the Way is long and dark: and as Travellers sometimes
amongst Mountains, by gaining the top of one, are so far from their
Journeys end; that they only come to see another lies before them:
so the Way of <hi>Nature,</hi> is so impervious, and, as I may say, down Hill
and up Hill, that how far soever we go, yet the surmounting of one
difficulty, is wont still to give us the prospect of another. We may
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100350:23"/>
therefore believe, our attainments will be imperfect, after we have done
all: but because we cannot attain to all, that therefore we should endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
after nothing; is an Inference, which looks so much awry from
the Practical Sense of Men, that it ought not to be answered. Nor with
better Reason, may we go about determining, what may be done. The
greatest Designs that any Men undertake, are of the greatest uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as to their Success: which if they appear to be of good Import,
though we know not how far they are attainable, we are to propound
the <hi>Means,</hi> in the utmost use whereof only, we can be able to judge:
A <hi>War</hi> is not to be quitted, for the hazards which attend it; nor the
<hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> broken up, because those that sit at them, have not
the Spirit of Prophecy, as well as of Wisdom. To conclude, If but
little should be effected, yet to design more, can do us no harm: For
although a Man shall never be able to hit <hi>Stars</hi> by shooting at them;
yet he shall come much nearer to them, than another that throws at
<hi>Apples.</hi>

chiefly instance. And first of all, for the <hi>Seed,</hi> we choose the great <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Bean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:100350:29"/>
3. §. If then we take a <hi>Bean</hi> and dissect it, we shall find it cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a doubled <hi>Vest</hi> or <hi>Coat.</hi> These <hi>Coats,</hi> while the <hi>Bean</hi> is yet
green, are separable, and easily distinguished. Or in an old one, after
it hath lay'n two or three days in a mellow Soil; or been soaked as
long a time in Water:<note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 2.</note> as in <hi>Tab.</hi> 1. When 'tis dry, they cleave so closely
together, that the Eye not before instructed, will judge them but one;
the inner <hi>Coat</hi> (which is of the most rare contexture) so far shrinking up,
as to seem only the roughness of the outer, somewhat resembling <hi>Wafers</hi>
under <hi>Maquaroons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. §. The Inner <hi>Coat,</hi> in its Natural State, is every where twice,
and in some places, thrice as thick, as the Outer. Next to the <hi>Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi>
which I shall presently describe, it is six or seven times thicker;
and encompasses the <hi>Radicle</hi> round about, as in the same <hi>Figure</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.<note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. §. At the thicker end of the <hi>Bean,</hi> in the outer <hi>Coat,</hi> a very
small <hi>Foramen</hi> presents it self, even to the bare Eye. In Dissection
'tis found to terminate against the point of that <hi>Part</hi> which I call
the <hi>Radicle.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 1-a</note> It is of that capacity, as to admit a small <hi>Virginal</hi> Wyer;
and is most of all conspicuous in a green <hi>Bean.</hi> Especially, if a little
magnified with a good <hi>Spectacle-Glass.</hi> This <hi>Foramen</hi> is not a hole ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
made, or by the breaking off of the Stalk; but designedly form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for the uses hereafter mentioned. It may be observed not only in
the great <hi>Garden-Bean,</hi> but likewise in the other <hi>kinds;</hi> in the <hi>French-Bean</hi>
very plainly; in <hi>Pease, Lupines, Vetches, Lentiles,</hi> and other
<hi>Pulse</hi> 'tis also found; and in many <hi>Seeds</hi> not reckoned of this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as in that of <hi>Foenugreek, Medica Tornata, Goats-Rue,</hi> and others:
In many of which, 'tis so very small, as scarcely, without the help of
<hi>Glasses</hi> to be discovered; and in some, not without cutting off part
of the <hi>Seed,</hi> which otherwise would intercept the sight hereof.</p>
                  <p>6. §. That this <hi>Foramen</hi> is truly permeable, even in old <hi>Setting-Beans,</hi>
and the other <hi>Seeds</hi> above named, appears upon their being
soaked for some time in Water. For then, taking them out, and crush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them a little, many small bubles will alternately arise and break up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
                  <p>7. §. Of all <hi>Seeds</hi> which have thick or hard <hi>Covers,</hi> it is also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
That they have the same likewise <hi>Perforated,</hi> as above said,
or in some other manner. And accordingly, although the <hi>Coats</hi> of such
<hi>Seeds</hi> as are lodg'd in <hi>Shells</hi> or <hi>Stones,</hi> being thin, are not visibly <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forated;</hi>
yet the <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Shells</hi> themselves always are; as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.
shall be seen how. To which <hi>Chapter,</hi> what is farther observable, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as to the nature and number of the <hi>Covers</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> I also
refer.</p>
                  <p>8. §. The <hi>Coats</hi> of the <hi>Bean</hi> being stripp'd off, the proper <hi>Seed</hi>
shews it self. The parts whereof it is composed, are three; <hi>sc.</hi> the
<hi>Main Body,</hi> and two more, appendant to it; which we may call, the
Three <hi>Organical Parts</hi> of the <hi>Bean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. §. The <hi>Main Body</hi> is not one entire piece, but always divided,
lengthwise, into two halves or <hi>Lobes,</hi> which are both joyn'd together
at the <hi>Basis</hi> of the <hi>Bean.</hi> These <hi>Lobes</hi> in dry <hi>Beans,</hi> are but difficultly
separated or observ'd;<note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 2, 3.</note> but in young ones, especially boil'd, they easily
slip asunder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100350:29"/>
10. §. Some very few <hi>Seeds</hi> are divided, not into two <hi>Lobes,</hi> but
into more;<note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 4. f. 5.</note> as that of <hi>Cresses</hi> into Six. And some are not at all divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but entire; as the Grains of <hi>Corn.</hi> Excepting which few, all other
<hi>Seeds,</hi> even the smallest, are divided, like as the <hi>Bean,</hi> into just two
<hi>Lobes.</hi> Whereof, though in most <hi>Seeds,</hi> because of their minuteness,
we cannot by dissection be inform'd; yet otherwise, we easily may,
as in this <hi>Chapter</hi> shall be seen.</p>
                  <p>11. §. At the <hi>Basis</hi> of the <hi>Bean,</hi> the two other <hi>Organical Parts</hi>
stand appendent; by mediation whereof, the two <hi>Lobes</hi> meet and join
together. The greater of these two <hi>Parts</hi> stands without the two
<hi>Lobes,</hi> and upon divesting the <hi>Bean</hi> of its <hi>Coats,</hi> is immediately visible.
'Tis of a white colour,<note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 2. &amp; 3—a</note> and more glossie than the <hi>Main Body,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when the <hi>Bean</hi> is young. In the <hi>Bean,</hi> and many other <hi>Seeds,</hi> 'tis
situated somewhat above the thicker end, as you hold the <hi>Bean</hi> in its
most proper posture for growth. In <hi>Oak Kernels,</hi> which we call <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 6—c</note>
                     <hi>Apple-Kernels, Almonds, Almonds,</hi> and many other <hi>Seeds,</hi> it stands pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
just from the end; the <hi>Basis</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> being in these the
same, but in the <hi>Bean</hi> divers.</p>
                  <p>12. §. This <hi>Part</hi> is found not only in the <hi>Bean,</hi> and the <hi>Seeds</hi>
above mentioned; but in all others: being that, which upon the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation
of the <hi>Seed,</hi> becomes the <hi>Root</hi> of the <hi>Plant;</hi> which therefore
may be called the <hi>Radicle:</hi> by which, I mean the Materials, abating
the Formality, of a <hi>Root.</hi> In <hi>Corn,</hi> it is that <hi>Part,</hi> which <hi>Malsters,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
its shooting forth, call the <hi>Come.</hi> 'Tis not easie to be observed, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in some few <hi>Seeds,</hi> amongst which, that of the <hi>Bean</hi> is the most
fair and ample of all I have seen. But that of some other <hi>Seeds,</hi> is, in
proportion,<note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 7—c</note> greater; as of <hi>Foenugreek,</hi> which is full as big as one of
its <hi>Lobes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. §. The lesser of the two said Appendents lies occult beeween
the two <hi>Lobes</hi> of the <hi>Bean,</hi> by separation whereof only it is to be seen.
'Tis enclos'd in two small <hi>Cavities,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 1. f<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3—b</note> form'd in the <hi>Lobes</hi> for its reception.
Its colour comes near to that of the <hi>Radicle;</hi> and it is founded upon the
<hi>Basis</hi> thereof, having a quite contrary production, <hi>sc.</hi> towards the <hi>Cone</hi>
of the <hi>Bean;</hi> as being that very <hi>Part,</hi> which, in process, becomes the
<hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Trunk</hi> of the <hi>Plant.</hi> In <hi>Corn,</hi> it is that <hi>Part,</hi> which after the
<hi>Radicle</hi> is sprouted forth, or <hi>come,</hi> shoots towards the smaller end of
the <hi>Grain;</hi> and by many <hi>Malsters,</hi> is called the <hi>Acrospire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. §, This <hi>Part</hi> is not, like the <hi>Radicle,</hi> an entire Body, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
at its loose end, into divers pieces, all very closely couched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as Feathers in a Bunch; for which reason it may be called the
<hi>Plume.</hi> They are so close, that only two or three of the outmost are
at first seen: but upon a nice and curious separation of these, the more
interiours still may be discovered. In the <hi>Bean,</hi> this may be done: but
in very few other <hi>Seeds;</hi> because of the extreme smallness of the <hi>Plume.</hi>
Now as the <hi>Plume</hi> is that <hi>Part</hi> which becomes the <hi>Trunk</hi> of the <hi>Plant,</hi>
so these pieces are so many true, and already formed, though not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd
<hi>Leaves,</hi> intended for the said <hi>Trunk,</hi> and foulded up in the same
<hi>plicature,</hi> wherein upon the sprouting of the <hi>Bean,</hi> they afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
In a <hi>French Bean,</hi> and especially in the larger white Kind, or in
the great <hi>Indian Phaseolus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 8—b</note> the two outmost are very fair and elegant.
In the great <hi>Garden-Bean</hi> two extraordinary small <hi>Plumes</hi> often, if not
always, stand one on either side the great one now describ'd: From
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100350:30"/>
which, in that they differ in nothing save in their size, I therefore on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
here just take notice of them. And these three Parts, <hi>sc.</hi> the <hi>Main
Body,</hi> the <hi>Radicle,</hi> and the <hi>Plume,</hi> are concurrent to the making up of
a <hi>Seed;</hi> and no more than these</p>
                  <p>15. §. Having thus taken a view of the <hi>Organical Parts</hi> of the
<hi>Bean,</hi> and other <hi>Seeds;</hi> let us next examine the <hi>Similary, sc.</hi> those
whereof the <hi>Organical</hi> are compos'd: a distinct observation of which,
for a clear understanding of the <hi>Vegetation</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> and of the whole
<hi>Plant</hi> arising thence is requisite: To obtain which, we must proceed
in our <hi>Anatomy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>16. §. Dissecting a <hi>Bean</hi> then, the first <hi>Part</hi> occurring is its <hi>Cuticle.</hi>
The Eye and first Thoughts, suggest it to be only a more dense and
glossy Superficies; but better enquiry discovers it a real <hi>Cuticle.</hi> 'Tis
so exquisitely thin, and for the most part, so firmly continuous with
the Body of the <hi>Bean,</hi> that it cannot, except in some small Rag, be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
seen, which, by carrying your Knife aslant into the <hi>Bean,</hi> and
then very gently bearing upward what you have cut, will separate, and
shew it self transparent. This <hi>Cuticle</hi> is not only spread upon the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex</hi>
of the <hi>Lobes,</hi> but also on their <hi>Flats,</hi> where they are contiguous,
extending it self likewise upon both the <hi>Radicle</hi> and <hi>Plume,</hi> and so over
the whole <hi>Bean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. §. This <hi>Part,</hi> though it be so far common with the <hi>Coats</hi> of
the <hi>Bean,</hi> as to be like those, an <hi>Integument;</hi> yet are we in a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Notion to conceive of it: For whereas the <hi>Coats,</hi> upon setting
the <hi>Bean,</hi> do only administer the <hi>Sap,</hi> and, as being superseded from
their Office, then die; as shall be seen: this, on the contrary, with the
<hi>Organical Parts</hi> of the <hi>Bean,</hi> is nourished, augmented, and by a real <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
co-extended.</p>
                  <p>18. §. Next to the <hi>Cuticle,</hi> we come to the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> it self;
the <hi>Part</hi> throughout which <hi>the Inner Body,</hi> whereof we shall speak anon,
is disseminated; for which reason I call it the <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> Not that
we are so meanly to conceive of it, as if (according to the stricter sense
of that word,) it were a meer concreted Juyce. For it is a Body
very curiously <hi>organiz'd,</hi> consisting of an infinite number of extreme
small <hi>Bladders;</hi> as in <hi>Tab.</hi> 1. is apparent. The <hi>Surface</hi> hereof is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
dense,<note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 9.</note> but inwardly, 'tis of a laxer Contexture. If you view it
in a <hi>Microscope,</hi> or with a very good <hi>Spectacle-Glass,</hi> it hath some si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
to the <hi>Pith,</hi> while <hi>sappy</hi> in the <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Trunks</hi> of <hi>Plants;</hi>
and that for good reason, as in <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. shall be seen. This is best seen in
green <hi>Beans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>19. §. This <hi>Part</hi> would seem by its colour to be peculiar to the
<hi>Lobes</hi> of the <hi>Bean;</hi> but as is the <hi>Cuticle,</hi> so is this also, common both to
the <hi>Radicle</hi> and <hi>Plume;</hi> that is, the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or Pulp of the <hi>Bean,</hi> as
to its essential substance, is the same in all three. The reason why the
colour of the <hi>Plume,</hi> and especially of the <hi>Radicle,</hi> which are white,
is so different from that of the <hi>Lobes,</hi> which are green, may chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon their being more compact and dense, and thence their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Tinctures. And therefore the <hi>Lobes</hi> themselves, which are green
while the <hi>Bean</hi> is <hi>young;</hi> yet when it is <hi>old</hi> and <hi>dry,</hi> become whitish
too. And in <hi>many</hi> other <hi>Seeds,</hi> as <hi>Acorns, Almonds,</hi> the <hi>Kernels</hi> of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
Plums, Nuts, &amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Lobes,</hi> even <hi>fresh</hi> and <hi>young,</hi> are pure white as
the <hi>Radicle</hi> it self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100350:30"/>
20. §. But although the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> be common, as is said, to
all the <hi>Organical Parts;</hi> yet in very differing proportions. In the
<hi>Plume,</hi> where it is proportionably least, it maketh about three <hi>Fifths</hi>
of the whole <hi>Plume;</hi> in the <hi>Radicle,</hi> it maketh above five Sevenths of
the whole <hi>Radicle;</hi> and in each <hi>Lobe,</hi> is so far over-proportionate, as
to make at least nine Tenths of the whole <hi>Lobe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. §. By what hath been said, that the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or <hi>Pulp</hi> is not
the only constituting <hi>Part,</hi> besides the <hi>Cuticle,</hi> is imply'd: there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
another <hi>Body,</hi> of an essentially different substance, embosom'd here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
which may be found not only in the <hi>Radicle</hi> and <hi>Plume,</hi> but also
in the <hi>Lobes</hi> themselves, and so in the whole <hi>Bean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>22. §. This <hi>Inner Body</hi> appears very plain and conspicuous in
cutting the <hi>Radicle</hi> athwart,<note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 10, 11, &amp; 12.</note> and so proceeding by degrees towards
the <hi>Plume,</hi> through both which it runneth in a large and strait <hi>Trunk.</hi>
In the <hi>Lobes,</hi> being it is there in so very small proportion, 'tis difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seen, especially towards their <hi>Verges.</hi> Yet if with a sharp Knife
you smoothly cut the <hi>Lobes</hi> of the <hi>Bean</hi> athwart,<note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 13.</note> divers small <hi>Specks,</hi>
of a different colour from that of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> standing therein all
along in a Line, may be observ'd; which <hi>Specks</hi> are the Terminations
of the <hi>Branches</hi> of this <hi>Inner Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>23. §. For this <hi>Inner body,</hi> as it is existent in every <hi>Organical Part</hi>
of the <hi>Bean;</hi> so is it, with respect to each <hi>Part,</hi> most regularly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed.
In a good part of the <hi>Radicle</hi> 'tis one entire <hi>Trunk;</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Basis</hi> thereof,<note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 14.</note> 'tis divided into three main <hi>Branches;</hi> the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemost
runneth directly into the <hi>Plume;</hi> the other two on either side
it, after a little space, pass into the <hi>Lobes;</hi> where the said <hi>Branches</hi>
dividing themselves into other smaller; and those into more, and smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
again, are terminated towards the Verges of each <hi>Lobe;</hi> in which
manner the said <hi>Inner Body</hi> being distributed it becomes in each <hi>Lobe</hi> a
true and perfect <hi>Root.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. §. Of this <hi>Seminal Root,</hi> as now we'll call it, from the Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here given, it is further observable; That the two main <hi>Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi>
hereof; in which the several <hi>Ramifications</hi> in each <hi>Lobe</hi> are all uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
are not committed into the <hi>Seminal Trunk</hi> of the <hi>Plume,</hi> nor yet
stand at right angles with <hi>That</hi> and the <hi>Radicle,</hi> and so with equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
towards them both: but being produced through part of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchyma</hi>
of the <hi>Radicle,</hi> are at last united therein to the main <hi>Trunk,</hi>
and make acute Angles therewith:<note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 14.</note> as may be seen in the same. <hi>f.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>25. §. This <hi>Seminal Root</hi> being so tender, cannot be perfectly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnated,
(as may the <hi>Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Parts</hi> of an <hi>Animal)</hi> by the most
accurate Hand. Yet by dissection begun and continu'd, as is above
declared, its whole frame and distribution may be easily observ'd. Again,
if you take the <hi>Lobe</hi> of a <hi>Bean,</hi> and lengthwise pare off its <hi>Parenchyma</hi>
by degrees, and in extreme thin slices, many <hi>Branches</hi> of the <hi>Seminal
Root,</hi> (which by the other way of Dissection were only noted by so
many <hi>Specks)</hi> both as they are fewer about the Basis of the <hi>Bean,</hi> and
more numerous towards its Verges, in some good distinction and entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
will appear. For this you must have new <hi>Beans:</hi> or else soaked in
Water, or buryed for some time.</p>
                  <p>26. §. As the <hi>Inner Body</hi> is branched out in the <hi>Lobes,</hi> so is it in
the <hi>Plume:</hi> For if you cut the <hi>Plume</hi> athwart, and from the <hi>Basis</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
along the Body thereof, you'll therein find, first, one large <hi>Trunk</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100350:31"/>
or <hi>Branch,</hi> and after four or five very small <hi>Specks</hi> round about it,
which are the terminations of so many lesser <hi>Branches</hi> therewith di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
to the several parts of the <hi>Plume.</hi> The distribution of the
<hi>Inner Body,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 11-<hi>c</hi>
                     </note> as it is continuous throughout all the <hi>Organical Parts</hi> of
the <hi>Bean,</hi> is represented, <hi>Tab. 1. f.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>27. §. This <hi>Inner Body</hi> is, by dissection, best observable in the
<hi>Bean</hi> and great <hi>Lupine.</hi> In other larger <hi>Pulse</hi> it shews likewise some
obscure Marks of it self. But in no other <hi>Seeds,</hi> which I have observed,
though of the greatest size: as of <hi>Apples, Plums, Nuts,</hi> &amp;c. is there any
clear appearance hereof, upon dissection, saving in the <hi>Radicle</hi> and
<hi>Plume;</hi> the reason of which is partly from its being, in most <hi>Seeds,</hi>
so extraordinary little; partly from its Colour, which in most <hi>Seeds,</hi>
is the same with that of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> it self, and so not distinguisha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from it.</p>
                  <p>28. §. Yet in a <hi>Gourd-Seed,</hi> the whole <hi>Seminal Root,</hi> not only its
<hi>Main Branches,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 15-<hi>c</hi>
                     </note> but also the Sub-divisions and <hi>Inosculations</hi> of the lesser
ones, are without any dissection, upon the separation of the <hi>Lobes,</hi> on
their contiguous Flats immediately apparent.</p>
                  <p>And as to the existence of this <hi>Seminal Root,</hi> what Dissection can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
attain, yet an ocular inspection in hundreds of other <hi>Seeds,</hi> even
the smallest, will demonstrate; as in this <hi>Chapter</hi> shall be seen how.</p>
                  <p>29. §. In the mean time, let us only take notice; That when we
say, every <hi>Plant</hi> hath its <hi>Root,</hi> we reckon short. For every <hi>Plant</hi> hath
really two, though not contemporary, yet successive <hi>Roots;</hi> its <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi>
or <hi>Seminal-Root</hi> within the <hi>Lobes</hi> or <hi>Main Body</hi> of its <hi>Seed;</hi> and
its <hi>Plant-Root,</hi> which the <hi>Radicle</hi> becometh in its growth: the <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma</hi>
of the <hi>Seed,</hi> being in some resemblance, that to the <hi>Seminal
Root</hi> at first, which the Mould is to the <hi>Plant-Root</hi> afterwards; and
the <hi>Seminal Root</hi> being that to the <hi>Plant-Root,</hi> which the <hi>Plant-Root</hi>
is to the <hi>Trunk.</hi> For our better understanding whereof, having taken
a view of the several <hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Bean,</hi> as far as Dissection conducts;
we will next briefly enquire into the Use of the said <hi>Parts,</hi> and in
what manner they are the Fountain of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> and concurrent to the
being of the future <hi>Plant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>30. §. THE GENERAL Cause of the growth of a <hi>Bean,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An Account of the <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </note> or other
<hi>Seed,</hi> is <hi>Fermentation.</hi> That is, the <hi>Bean</hi> lying in the Mould, and a
moderate access of some moisture, partly dissimilar, and partly conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous,
being made, a gentle <hi>Fermentation</hi> thence ariseth. By which,
the <hi>Bean</hi> swelling, and the <hi>Sap</hi> still encreasing, and the <hi>Bean</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still to swell, the work thus proceeds: as is the usual way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating.
But that there is simply a <hi>Fermentation,</hi> and so a sufficient
supply of <hi>Sap</hi> is not enough: but that this <hi>Fermentation,</hi> and the <hi>Sap</hi>
wherein 'tis made, should be under a various Government, by divers
<hi>Parts</hi> thereto subservient, is also requisite; and as the various prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the <hi>Aliment</hi> in an <hi>Animal,</hi> equally necessary: the particular
process of the Work according whereto, we find none undertaking to
declare.</p>
                  <p>31. §. Let us look upon a <hi>Bean</hi> then, as a piece of Work so fram'd
and set together, as to declare a Design for the production of a <hi>Plant;</hi>
which, upon its lying in some convenient Soil, is thus effected. First
of all, the <hi>Bean</hi> being enfoulded round in its <hi>Coats,</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> wherewith
it is fed, must of necessity pass through these: By which means, it is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100350:31"/>
not only in a proportionate quantity, and by degrees; but also in a
purer body; and possibly not without some <hi>Vegetable Tincture,</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the <hi>Bean.</hi> Whereas, were the <hi>Bean</hi> naked, the <hi>Sap</hi> must
needs be, as over-copious, so but crude and immature, as not being <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi>
through so fine a <hi>Cotton</hi> as the <hi>Coats</hi> be. And as they have the use
of a <hi>Filtre</hi> to the transient <hi>Sap;</hi> so of a <hi>Vessel</hi> to that which is still
deposited within them; being alike accommodated to the securer <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi>
hereof, as Bottles or Barrels are to Beer, or any other <hi>Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
Liquor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>32. §. And as the <hi>Fermentation</hi> is promoted by some <hi>Aperture</hi> in
the Vessel; so have we the <hi>Foramen</hi> in the upper <hi>Coat</hi> also contrived.
That if there should be need of some more <hi>Aiery</hi> Particles to excite
the <hi>Fermentation;</hi> through <hi>this,</hi> they may obtain their Entry. Or,
on the contrary, should there be any such <hi>Particles</hi> or <hi>Steams,</hi> as might
damp the genuine proceeding thereof, through this again, they may
have easie issue. Or if, by being over copious, they should become too
high a <hi>Ferment;</hi> and so precipitate those soft and slow degrees, as are
necessary to a due <hi>Vegetation.</hi> The said <hi>Aperture</hi> being that, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Pasport, here to the <hi>Sap,</hi> which what we call the <hi>Bung-hole</hi> of
the Barrel, is to the new tunn'd Liquor.</p>
                  <p>33. §. And the <hi>Radicle</hi> being designed to shoot forth first, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
shall be shew'd how; therefore is it distinctly surrounded with
the Inner and more succulent <hi>Coat.</hi> That being thereby suppled on
every side, its eruption may be the better promoted.</p>
                  <p>34. §. The <hi>Sap</hi> being passed through the <hi>Coats,</hi> it next enters the
Body of the <hi>Bean;</hi> yet not indiscriminately neither; but, being filtred
through the <hi>Outer Coat,</hi> and fermented in the Body of the <hi>Inner,</hi> is by
mediation of the <hi>Cuticle,</hi> again more finely filtr'd, and so entereth the
<hi>Parenchyma</hi> it self under a fourth Government.</p>
                  <p>35. §. Through which <hi>Part</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> passing towards the <hi>Seminal
Root,</hi> as through that which is of a more spatious content; besides the
benefit it hath of a farther <hi>percolation,'</hi> it will also find room enough
for a more free and active fermenting and <hi>maturation</hi> herein. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moreover, part of the true Body of the <hi>Bean,</hi> and so with its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Seminalities</hi> or <hi>Tinctures</hi> copiously repleat; the <hi>Sap</hi> will not only
find <hi>room,</hi> but also <hi>matter</hi> enough, by whose Energy its <hi>Fermentation</hi>
will still be more advanced,</p>
                  <p>36. § And the <hi>Sap</hi> being duly prepared here, it next passeth into
all the <hi>Branches</hi> of the <hi>Seminal Root,</hi> and so under a fifth Government.
Wherein how delicate 'tis now become, we may conceive by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
betwixt the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> and this <hi>Seminal Root;</hi> so much only
of the best digested <hi>Sap</hi> being discharged from the whole Stock in that,
as this will receive. And this, moreover, as the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> with its
proper <hi>Seminalities</hi> being endowed; the <hi>Sap</hi> for the supply of the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicle,</hi>
and of the young <hi>Root</hi> from thence, is duly prepared therein, and
with its highest <hi>Tincture</hi> and <hi>Impregnation</hi> at last enriched.</p>
                  <p>37. §. The <hi>Sap</hi> being thus prepared in the <hi>Lobes</hi> of the <hi>Bean,</hi> 'tis
thence discharg'd; and either into the <hi>Plume,</hi> or the <hi>Radicle,</hi> must forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
issue. And since the <hi>Plume</hi> is a dependent on the <hi>Radicle;</hi> the
<hi>Sap</hi> therefore ought first to be dispenced to this: which accordingly,
is ever found to shoot forth before the <hi>Plume:</hi> and sometimes an inch
or two in length. Now because the primitive course of the <hi>Sap</hi> into
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100350:32"/>
the <hi>Radicle,</hi> is thus requisite; therefore, by the frame of the <hi>Parts</hi> of
the <hi>Bean</hi> is it also made necessary. The two main <hi>Branches</hi> of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
Root,</hi> being produced, as is before observed, not into the <hi>Plume,</hi>
but the <hi>Radicle.</hi> Now the <hi>Sap</hi> being brought as far as the <hi>Seminal
Root,</hi> in either <hi>Lobe;</hi> and according to the conduct thereof continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still to move: it must needs immediately issue into the same <hi>Part,</hi>
whereinto the main <hi>Branches</hi> themselves do;<note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 14.</note> that is, into the <hi>Radicle.</hi>
By which <hi>Sap,</hi> thus bringing the several <hi>Tinctures</hi> of the <hi>Parts</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
with it, being now fed; it is no longer a meer <hi>Radicle,</hi> but is
made also <hi>Seminal,</hi> and so becomes a perfect <hi>Root.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>38. §. The <hi>Plume,</hi> all this while, lyes close and still. For the sake
of which, chiefly it is, that the <hi>Bean</hi> and other <hi>Seeds</hi> are divided into
<hi>Lobes, viz.</hi> That it might be warmly and safely lodged up between
them, and so secur'd from the Injuries so tender a <hi>Part</hi> would sustain
from the Mould; whereto, had the <hi>Main Body</hi> been entire, it must,
upon the cleaving of the <hi>Coats,</hi> have lay'n contiguous.</p>
                  <p>39. §. But the <hi>Radicle</hi> being thus impreguated and shot into a
<hi>Root;</hi> 'tis now time for the <hi>Plume</hi> to rouze out of its Cloysters, and
germinate too: In order whereto, 'tis now fed from the <hi>Root,</hi> with
laudable and sufficient <hi>Aliment.</hi> For as the Supplies and Motion of
<hi>Sap</hi> were first made from the <hi>Lobes,</hi> towards the <hi>Root:</hi> so the <hi>Root</hi>
being well shot into the Mould, and now receiving a new and more
copious <hi>Sap</hi> from thence; the motion hereof must needs be stronger,
and by degrees proceed in a contrary course, <hi>sc.</hi> from the <hi>Root</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the <hi>Plume:</hi> and, by the coutinuation of the <hi>Seminal Root,</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
conducted thereinto; by which being fed, it gradually enlarges
and displays it self.</p>
                  <p>40. §. The course of the <hi>Sap</hi> thus turned, it issues, I say, in a
direct Line from the <hi>Root</hi> into the <hi>Plume:</hi> but collaterally, into the
<hi>Lobes</hi> also; <hi>sc.</hi> by those two aforesaid <hi>Branches</hi> which are obliquely
transmitted from the <hi>Radicle</hi> into either <hi>Lobe.</hi> By which <hi>Branches</hi> the
said <hi>Sap</hi> being disbursed back into all the <hi>Seminal Root,</hi> and from
thence, likewise into the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Lobes,</hi> they are both thus
fed, and for some time augmenting themselves, really grow: as in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines</hi>
is evident.</p>
                  <p>41. §. Yet is not this common to all <hi>Seeds.</hi> Some rot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground;
as <hi>Corn;</hi> being of a laxer and less Oleous Substance, differing
herein from most other <hi>Seeds;</hi> and being not divided into <hi>Lobes,</hi> but
one entire thick Body. And some, although they continue firm, and
are divided into <hi>Lobes,</hi> yet rise not; as the great <hi>Garden Bean.</hi> In
which, therefore, it is observable, That the two Main <hi>Branches</hi> of the
<hi>Lobes,</hi> in comparison with that which runs into the <hi>Plume,</hi> are but
mean; and so insufficient to the feeding and vegetation of the <hi>Lobes;</hi>
the <hi>Plume,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 1. f. 14.</note> on the contrary, growing so lusty, as to mount up without
them.</p>
                  <p>42. §. Excepting a few of these Two Kinds, all other <hi>Seeds</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
(which I have observed) besides that they continue firm;
upon the <hi>Vegetation</hi> of the <hi>Plume,</hi> do mount also upwards, and advance
above the Ground together with it; as all <hi>Seeds</hi> which spring up with
one or more <hi>Dissimilar Leaves:</hi> These <hi>Dissimilar Leaves,</hi> for the most
part <hi>Two,</hi> which first spring up, and are of a different shape from those
that follow, being the very <hi>Lobes</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> divided, expanded, and thus
advanced.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:100350:32"/>
43. §. The Impediments of our apprehension hereof are the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
Size and Shape of the <hi>Dissimilar Leaves.</hi> Notwithstanding, that
they are nothing else but the <hi>Main Body</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> how I came
first to conceive, and afterwards to know it, was thus. First, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in general, that the <hi>Dissimilar Leaves,</hi> were never jagg'd, but
even edg'd: And seeing the even verges of the <hi>Lobes</hi> of the <hi>Seed</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
respondent, I was apt to think, that those which were so like, might
prove the same. Next descending to particular <hi>Seeds,</hi> I observed, first,
of the <hi>Lupine;</hi> that, as to its Colour, advancing above the Ground,
(as it useth to do) it was always changed into a perfect Green. And
why might not the same by parity of Reason be inferred of other <hi>Seeds?</hi>
That, as to its size, it grew but little bigger than when first set. Whence,
as I discern'd (the Augmentation being but little) we here had only
the two <hi>Lobes:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 2. f. 1.</note> So, (as some augmentation there was) I inferr'd the
like might be, and that, in farther degrees, in other <hi>Seeds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>44. §. Next of the <hi>Cucumber-Seed,</hi> That, as to its Colour, often
appearing above ground, in its primitive white, from white it turns to
yellow, and from yellow to green; the proper colour of a <hi>Leaf.</hi> That,
as to its size, though at its first arise, the <hi>Lobes</hi> were little bigger than
upon setting;<note place="margin">Tab. 2. f. 2.</note> yet afterwards, as they chang'd their Colour, so their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions
also, growing to a three-four-five-fold amplitude above their
primitive size. But whereas the <hi>Lobes</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> are in proportion,
narrow, short and thick: how then come the <hi>Dissimilar Leaves,</hi> to be
so exceeding broad, or long, and thin? The Question answers it self:
For the <hi>Dissimilar Leaves,</hi> for that very reason are so thin, because so
very broad or long; as we see many things, how much they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in length or breadth, so much they lose in depth, or grow
more thin; which is that which here befalls the now effoliated <hi>Lobes.</hi>
For being once dis-imprisoned from their <hi>Coats,</hi> and the course of the <hi>Sap</hi>
into them, now more and more encreased; they must needs very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
amplisie themselves: and from the manner wherein the <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Root</hi> is branched in them, that amplification cannot be in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note place="margin">Tab. 2. f. 3.</note>
but in length or breadth. In both which, in some <hi>Dissimilar
Leaves,</hi> 'tis very remarkable; especially in length, as in those of <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
Thorn-Apple,</hi> and others; whose <hi>Seeds,</hi> although very small, yet
the <hi>Lobes</hi> of those <hi>Seeds</hi> growing up into <hi>Dissimilar Leaves,</hi> are extended
an Inch, and sometimes more, in length. Though he that shall attempt to
get a clear sight of the <hi>Lobes</hi> of <hi>Thorn-Apple,</hi> and some others, by <hi>Dissecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
will find it no easie Task; yet is that which may be obtained; and in
the Last <hi>Book</hi> shall be shew'd. From all which, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of other <hi>Seeds,</hi> I at last found, that the <hi>Dissimilar Leaves</hi> of
a young <hi>Plant,</hi> are nothing else but the <hi>Lobes</hi> or <hi>Main Body</hi> of its
<hi>Seed.</hi> So that, as the <hi>Lobes</hi> did at first feed and impregnate the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicle</hi>
into a <hi>perfect Root;</hi> so the <hi>Root,</hi> being perfected, doth again feed,
and by degrees amplifie each <hi>Lobe</hi> into a perfect <hi>Leaf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>45. §. The Original of the <hi>Dissimilar Leaves</hi> thus known, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
why some <hi>Plants</hi> have none; because the <hi>Seed</hi> either riseth
not, as <hi>Garden-Beans, Corn,</hi> &amp;c. Or upon rising, the <hi>Lobes</hi> are little
alter'd, as <hi>Lupines, Pease,</hi> &amp;c. Why, though the proper <hi>Leaves</hi> are
often indented round; the <hi>Dissimilar</hi> like the <hi>Lobes</hi> are even-edg'd.
Why, though the proper <hi>Leaves</hi> are often hairy, yet these are ever
smooth. Why some have more <hi>Dissimilar Leaves</hi> than two, as <hi>Cresses,</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:100350:33"/>
which have six,<note place="margin">Hist. of the <hi>Prop.</hi> of <hi>Vege.</hi>
                     </note> as the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Sharrock</hi> also observes. The reason
whereof is, because the <hi>Main Body</hi> is not divided into Two, but Six, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<hi>Lobes,</hi> as I have often counted. Why <hi>Radishes</hi> seem at first to
have four, which yet after appear plainly two: because the <hi>Lobes</hi> of the
<hi>Seed,</hi> have both a little Indenture, and are both plaited, one over the
other. To which, other Instances might be added.</p>
                  <p>46. The use of the <hi>Dissimilar Leaves</hi> is, first, for the protection
of the <hi>Plume;</hi> which being but young, and so but soft and tender, is
provided with these, as a double Guard, one on either side of it. For
this reason it is, that the <hi>Plume,</hi> in <hi>Corn,</hi> is trussed up within a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous
<hi>Sheath:</hi> and that of a <hi>Bean,</hi> cooped up betwixt a pair of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foyls:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 3.</note>
But where the <hi>Lobes</hi> rise, there the <hi>Plume</hi> hath neither of them,
being both needless.</p>
                  <p>47. §. Again, since the <hi>Plume,</hi> being yet tender, may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
not only by the <hi>Aer,</hi> but also for want of <hi>Sap,</hi> the supplies from
the <hi>Root</hi> being yet but slow and sparing; that the said <hi>Plume</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by the <hi>Dissimilar Leaves,</hi> may have the advantage likewise of
some refreshment from Dew or Rain. For these having their <hi>Basis</hi>
a little beneath that of the <hi>Plume,</hi> and expanding themselves on all
sides of it, they often stand after Rain, like a Vessel of Water, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
soaking and suppling it, lest its new access into the <hi>Ayr,</hi> should
shrivel it.</p>
                  <p>48. §. Moreover, that since the <hi>Dissimilar Leaves</hi> by their <hi>Basis</hi>
intercept the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Plume,</hi> the greater and grosser part of the
<hi>Sap,</hi> may be, by the way, deposited into those; and so the purest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
into the yet but young and delicate <hi>Plume,</hi> as its fittest <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>49. §. Lastly, we have here a demonstration of the being of
the <hi>Seminal Root:</hi> which, since through the colour or smalness of
the <hi>Seed,</hi> it could not by Dissection be observ'd, except in some
few; Nature hath here provided us a way of viewing it in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he now
effoliated <hi>Lobes,</hi> not of one or two <hi>Seeds,</hi> but of hundreds; the <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Root</hi> visibly branching it self towards the Cone or Verges of the
said <hi>Lobes,</hi> or now <hi>Dissimilar Leaves.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING Examin'd and pursu'd the Degrees of
<hi>Vegetation</hi> in the <hi>Seed,</hi> we find its two <hi>Lobes</hi> have
here their utmost period: and, that having conveyed
their <hi>Seminalities</hi> into the <hi>Radicle</hi> and <hi>Plume;</hi> these
therefore, as the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Trunk</hi> of the <hi>Plant,</hi> still
survive. Of these, in their order, we next pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to speak; and first, of the <hi>Root:</hi> whereof, as
well as of the <hi>Seed,</hi> we must by Dissection inform our selves.</p>
                  <p>2. §. In Dissection of a <hi>Root</hi> then, we shall find it with the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicle,</hi>
as the <hi>Parts</hi> of an Old Man with those of a <hi>Foetus,</hi> substantially,
one. The first <hi>Part</hi> occurring is its <hi>Skin,</hi> the Original whereof is
from the <hi>Seed:</hi> For that extreme thin <hi>Cuticle</hi> which is spread over the
<hi>Lobes</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> and from thence over the <hi>Radicle,</hi> upon the
shooting of the <hi>Radicle</hi> into a <hi>Root,</hi> is co-extended, and becomes its
<hi>Skin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. §. The next <hi>Part</hi> is the <hi>Cortical Body.</hi> Which, when it is thin,
is commonly called the <hi>Barque.</hi> The Original hereof, likewise is
from the <hi>Seed;</hi> or the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> which is there common both to
the <hi>Lobes</hi> and <hi>Radicle,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 2. f. 4.</note> being by <hi>Vegetation</hi> augmented and prolonged
into the <hi>Root,</hi> the same becomes the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Barque.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. §. The Contexture of this <hi>Parenchyma</hi> may be well illustrated
by that of a <hi>Sponge,</hi> being a Body Porous, Dilative and Pliable. Its
<hi>Pores,</hi> as they are innumerable, so, extream small. These <hi>Pores</hi> are
not only susceptive of so much Moisture as to fill, but also to enlarge
themselves, and so to dilate the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> wherein they are: which
by the shriv'ling in thereof, upon its being expos'd to the Air, is also
seen. In which dilatation, many of its Parts becoming more lax and
distant, and none of them suffering a solution of their continuity; 'tis
a Body also sufficiently pliable; that is to say, a <hi>most exquisitely fine-wrought
Sponge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. §. The Extention of these <hi>Pores</hi> is much alike by the length
and breadth of the <hi>Root;</hi> which from the shrinking up of the <hi>Cortical
Body,</hi> in a piece of a cut <hi>Root,</hi> by the same dimensions, is argu'd.</p>
                  <p>6. §. The proportions of this <hi>Cortical Body</hi> are various: If thin,
'tis, as is said, called a <hi>Barque;</hi> and thought to serve to no other end,
than what is vulgarly ascrib'd to a <hi>Barque;</hi> which is a narrow conceit.
If a Bulky Body, in comparison with That within it, as in the young
<hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Cichory, Asparagus,</hi> &amp;c. 'tis here, because the fairest, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
taken for the prime <hi>Part;</hi> which, though, as to Medicinal use,
it is; yet, as to the private use of the <hi>Plant,</hi> not so. The Colour
hereof, though it be originally white, yet in the continued growth of
the <hi>Root,</hi> divers <hi>Tinctures,</hi> as yellow in <hi>Dock, red</hi> in <hi>Bistort,</hi> are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
introduced.</p>

7. §. Next within this Part stands the <hi>Lignous Body:</hi> This <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Body,</hi> lyeth with all its parts, so far as they are visible, in a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
or <hi>Ring.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 2. f 4. <hi>b.</hi>
                     </note> Yet are there divers extreme small <hi>Fibres</hi> thereto pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel,
usually mixed with the <hi>Cortical Body;</hi> and by the somewhat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
colour of the said <hi>Cortical Body</hi> where they stand, may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
These <hi>Fibres</hi> the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> and <hi>Skin,</hi> altogether, properly
make the <hi>Barque.</hi> The Original of this <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> as of the two
former, is from the <hi>Seed;</hi> or, the <hi>Seminal Roots</hi> of both the <hi>Lobes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
united in the <hi>Radicle,</hi> and with its <hi>Parenchyma</hi> co-extended, is here
in the <hi>Root</hi> of the <hi>Plant,</hi> the <hi>Lignous Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. §. The Contexture hereof, in many of its parts, is much more
close than that of the <hi>Cortical;</hi> and their <hi>Pores</hi> very different. For
whereas those of the <hi>Cortical</hi> are infinitely numerous, these of the <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous</hi>
are in comparison nothing so. But these, although fewer, yet
are they, many of them, more open, fair and visible: as in a very thin
Slice cut athwart the young <hi>Root</hi> of a <hi>Tree,</hi> and held up against the
light, is apparent. Yet not in all equally; in <hi>Coran</hi>-Tree, <hi>Goosberry</hi>-Tree,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> less, in <hi>Oak, Plums,</hi> and especially <hi>Damascens,</hi> more; in
<hi>Elder,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 2. f. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Vines, &amp;c.</hi> most conspicuous. And as they are different in
number and size, so also (whereon the numerousness of the <hi>Pores</hi> of the
<hi>Cortical Body</hi> principally depends) in their shape. For whereas those
of the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> are extended much alike both by the length and
breadth of the <hi>Root;</hi> these of the <hi>Lignous,</hi> are only by the length;
which especially in <hi>Vines,</hi> and some other <hi>Roots</hi> is evident. Of these
<hi>Pores,</hi> 'tis also observable, that although in all places of the <hi>Root</hi> they
are visible,<note place="margin">Tab. 2. f. 7 <hi>a. b.</hi>
                     </note> yet most fair and open about the <hi>filamentous Extremities</hi> of
some <hi>Roots,</hi> where about, the <hi>Roots</hi> have no <hi>Pith;</hi> as in <hi>Fenil.</hi> And
in many <hi>Roots,</hi> higher.</p>
                  <p>9. §. The proportion betwixt this <hi>Lignous Body</hi> and the <hi>Cortical,</hi>
is various, as was said; yet in this, constant, <hi>sc.</hi> that in the <hi>filamentous</hi>
and smaller Parts of the <hi>Root,</hi> the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> is very much the less;
running like a slender <hi>Wyer</hi> or <hi>Nerve</hi> through the other surrounding
it. Whereas in the upper part, it is often times of far greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
than the <hi>Cortical,</hi> although it be encompass'd by it. They stand
both together pyramidally, which is most common to <hi>Infant Roots,</hi> but
also to a great many others.</p>
                  <p>10. The next <hi>Part</hi> observable in the <hi>Root,</hi> is the <hi>Insertment.</hi> The
existence hereof, so far as we can yet observe, is sometimes in the <hi>Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
of the <hi>Seed</hi> it self; I cannot say always. As to its substantial na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
we are more certain; that it is the same with that of the <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma</hi>
of the <hi>Radicle;</hi> being always at least augmented, and so, in part,
originated from the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> and so, at second hand, from the said
<hi>Parenchyma.</hi> For in dissecting a <hi>Root,</hi> I find, that the <hi>Cortical Body</hi>
doth not only environ the <hi>Lignous,</hi> but is also wedg'd, and in many
Pieces <hi>inserted</hi> into it; and that the said inserted Pieces make not a
meer Indenture, but transmit and shoot themselves quite through as
far as the <hi>Pith:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 2. f. 5.</note> which in a thin Slice cut athwart the <hi>Root,</hi> as so many
lines drawn from the Circumference towards the Center, shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>11. §. The <hi>Pores</hi> of the <hi>Insertment</hi> are sometimes, at least, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
somewhat more by the breadth of the <hi>Root,</hi> as about the top of
the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Borage</hi> may be seen; and are thus different from those of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100350:34"/>
the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> which are extended by the length and breadth much
alike; and from those of the <hi>Lignous,</hi> being only by its length.</p>
                  <p>12. §. The number and size of these Insertions are various. In
<hi>Hawthorn,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 2. f. 5. &amp; 6.</note> and some others, and especially <hi>Willows,</hi> they are most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
small; in <hi>Cherries</hi> and <hi>Plums</hi> they are Biger; and in the <hi>Vine</hi>
and some other <hi>Trees,</hi> very fairly apparent. In the <hi>Roots</hi> of most
<hi>Herbs</hi> they are generally more easily discoverable; which may lead to
the observation of them in all.</p>
                  <p>13. §. These <hi>Insertions,</hi> although they are continuous through
both the length and breadth of the <hi>Root;</hi> yet not so in all Parts, but
by the several shootings of the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> they are frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted.
For of the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> it is (here best) observable;
That its several <hi>Shootings,</hi> betwixt which the <hi>Cortical</hi> is inserted, are
not, throughout the <hi>Root,</hi> wholly distinct, strait and parallel: but
that all along being enarch'd, the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> both in length and
breadth, is thus disposed into <hi>Braces</hi> or <hi>Osculations.</hi> Betwixt these
several <hi>Shootings</hi> of the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> thus osculated,<note place="margin">Tab. 2. f. 8.</note> the <hi>Cortical</hi>
shooting, and being also osculated answerably <hi>Brace</hi> for <hi>Brace,</hi> that
which I call the <hi>Insertment</hi> is framed thereof.</p>
                  <p>14. §. These <hi>Osculations</hi> are so made, that the <hi>Pores</hi> or <hi>Fibres</hi> of
the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> I think, notwithstanding, seldom or never run one
into another; being, though contiguous, yet still distinct. In
the same manner as some of the <hi>Nerves,</hi> though they meet, and for
some space are associated together, yet 'tis most probable, that none
of their <hi>Fibres</hi> are truly inosculated, saving perhaps, in the <hi>Plexures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. §. These <hi>Osculations</hi> of the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> and so the intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Insertions</hi> of the <hi>Cortical,</hi> are not to be observ'd by the
traverse cut of the <hi>Root,</hi> but by taking off the <hi>Barque.</hi> In the
<hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Trees,</hi> they are generally obscure; but in <hi>Herbs</hi> often more
distincty apparent; and especially in a <hi>Turnep:</hi> the appearance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the <hi>Barque</hi> being stripp'd off, is as a piece of close-wrought Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
fill'd up with the <hi>Insertions</hi> from thence.</p>
                  <p>16. §. The next and last distinct <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Root</hi> is the <hi>Pith.</hi> The
substantial nature thereof, is, as was said of the <hi>Insertment,</hi> the same
likewise with that of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi> And according to
the best observation I have yet made, 'tis sometimes existent in its <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicle;</hi>
in which, the two main <hi>Branches</hi> of the <hi>Lobes</hi> both meeting,
and being osculated together, are thus dispos'd into one round and
tubular <hi>Trunk,</hi> and so environing part of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
a <hi>Pith;</hi> as in either the <hi>Radicle,</hi> or the young <hi>Root</hi> of the great <hi>Bean</hi>
or <hi>Lupine,</hi> may, I think, be well seen.</p>
                  <p>17. §. But many times the Original hereof is immediately from
the <hi>Barque.</hi> For in dissection of divers <hi>Roots,</hi> both of <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Herbs,</hi>
as of <hi>Barberry</hi> or <hi>Mallows,</hi> it is observable, That the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> and
<hi>Pith,</hi> are both of them participant of the same Colour; in the <hi>Barberry,</hi>
both of them tinged yellow, and in <hi>Mallows,</hi> green. In cutting the
smaller Parts of the <hi>Roots</hi> of many <hi>Plants,</hi> as of <hi>Borage, Mallows, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sley,
Columbine, &amp;c.</hi> 'tis also evident, That the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> is not
there,<note place="margin">Tab. 2. f. 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> in the least Concave, but standeth Solid, or without any <hi>Pith,</hi>
in the Center; and that the <hi>Insertions</hi> being gradually multiplied after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
the <hi>Pith,</hi> at length, towards the thicker parts of the <hi>Root,</hi>
shews and enlarges it self. Whence it appears, that in all such <hi>Roots,</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100350:35"/>
the <hi>Pith</hi> is not only of the same substantial nature, and by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions</hi>
doth communicate with the <hi>Barque;</hi> and that it is also aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by it; which is true of the <hi>Pith</hi> of all <hi>Roots;</hi> but is moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
by mediation of the said <hi>Insertions,</hi> wholly originated from it;
that is to say, from the <hi>Parenchymous</hi> Part thereof. The various appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of the <hi>Insertions</hi> and <hi>Pith</hi> from the filamentous <hi>Parts</hi> to the
top of the <hi>Root,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 2. f. 9.</note> see in <hi>Tab.</hi> 2. The <hi>Pores</hi> of the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> as
it stands entire in the said filamentous <hi>Parts,</hi> are best seen when they
have lain by a night to dry, after cutting.</p>
                  <p>18. §. A farther evidence hereof are the Proportions betwixt the
<hi>Cortical Body</hi> and <hi>Pith.</hi> For as about the inferiour Parts of the <hi>Root,</hi>
where the <hi>Pith</hi> is small, the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> is proportionably great; so
about the top, where the <hi>Pith</hi> is enlarged, the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> (now more
properly becoming a <hi>Barque)</hi> groweth proportionably less, <hi>sc.</hi> because
the <hi>Insertions</hi> do still more and more enlarge the <hi>Pith.</hi> Likewise the
peculiar frame of some <hi>Roots,</hi> wherein besides the <hi>Pith,</hi> the <hi>Lignous
Body</hi> being divided into two or more <hi>Rings,</hi> there are also one or more
thick <hi>Rings,</hi> of a white and soft substance, which stand betwixt them;
and are nothing else but the <hi>Insertions</hi> of the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> collected
into the said <hi>Rings;</hi> but, towards the top of the <hi>Root,</hi> being inserted
again, thus make a large and ample <hi>Pith;</hi> as in older <hi>Fennel</hi>-Roots, those
of <hi>Beet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 2. f. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Turnep,</hi> and some other <hi>Herbs,</hi> is seen.</p>
                  <p>19. §. The <hi>Pores</hi> of the <hi>Pith,</hi> as those of the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> are
extended both by the breadth and length of the <hi>Root,</hi> much alike; yet
are they more or less of a greater size than those of the <hi>Cortical
Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. §. The Proportions of the <hi>Pith,</hi> are various; in <hi>Trees,</hi> but
small; in <hi>Herbs,</hi> generally, very fair; in some making by far the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of the <hi>Root;</hi> as in a <hi>Turnep:</hi> By reason of the wide circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
whereof, and so the finer Concoction and Assimilation of its
Sap; that <hi>Part</hi> which in most old <hi>Trunks</hi> is a dry and harsh <hi>Pith,</hi> here
proves a tender, pleasant meat.</p>
                  <p>21. §. In the <hi>Roots</hi> of very many <hi>Plants,</hi> as <hi>Turneps, Carrots, &amp;c.</hi>
the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> besides its main utmost <hi>Ring,</hi> hath divers of its <hi>os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
Fibres</hi> dispersed throughout the Body of the <hi>Pith;</hi> sometimes
all alike, and sometimes more especially in, or near, its Center; which
<hi>Fibres,</hi> as they run towards the top of the <hi>Root,</hi> still declining the
Center, at last collaterally strike into its Circumference; either all of
them, or some few, keeping the Center still. Of these principally, the
Succulent part of the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> of the <hi>Trunk</hi> is often originated.</p>
                  <p>22. §. Some of these <hi>Pith-Fibres,</hi> although they are so exceeding
slender, yet in some <hi>Roots,</hi> as in that of <hi>Flower de liz,</hi> they are visibly
concave, each of them, in their several Cavities also embosoming a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
small <hi>Pith;</hi> the sight whereof, the <hi>Root</hi> being cut traverse, and laid
in a Window for a day or two to dry, may without <hi>Glasses</hi> be obtain'd.
And this is the general account of the <hi>Root;</hi> the declaration of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of its growth, with the use and service of its several <hi>Parts,</hi> we shall
next endeavour.</p>
                  <p>23. §. I SAY THEN, That the <hi>Radicle</hi> being impregnate, and
shot into the Moulds,<note place="margin">An Account of the Growth of the <hi>Root.</hi>
                     </note> the contiguous moisture, by the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Body laxe and Spongy, is easily admitted: Yet not all indiscrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately,
but that which is more adapted to pass through the surrounding
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100350:35"/>
                     <hi>Cuticle.</hi> Which transient <hi>Sap,</hi> though it thus becomes fine, yet is not
simple; but a mixture of <hi>Particles,</hi> both in respect of those originally
in the <hi>Root,</hi> and amongst themselves, somewhat heterogeneous. And
being lodg'd in the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> moderately laxe, and of a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
form; the effect will be an easie Fermentation. The <hi>Sap</hi> fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
a separation of <hi>Parts</hi> will follow; some whereof will be impact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Circumference of the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> whence the <hi>Cuticle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a <hi>Skin;</hi> as we see in the growing of the Coats of Cheeses, of
the Skin over divers Liquors, and the like. Whereupon the <hi>Sap</hi>
passing into the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> through this, as through a <hi>Manica Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocratis,</hi>
is still more finely filtred. With which <hi>Sap,</hi> the <hi>Cortical
Body</hi> being dilated as far as its <hi>Tone,</hi> without a solution of Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,
will bear; and the supply of the <hi>Sap</hi> still renew'd: the purest part,
as most apt and ready, recedes, with its due <hi>Tinctures,</hi> from the said
<hi>Cortical Body,</hi> to all the parts of the <hi>Lignous;</hi> both those mixed with
the <hi>Barque,</hi> and those lying within it. Which <hi>Lignous Body</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
super-inducing its own proper <hi>Tinctures</hi> into the said <hi>Sap;</hi> 'tis
now to its highest preparaton wrought up, and becomes (as they speak
of that of an Animal) the Vegetative <hi>Ros</hi> or <hi>Cambium:</hi> the noblest
part whereof is at last coagulated in, and assimilated to the like sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
with the said <hi>Lignous Body.</hi> The remainder, though not united
to it, yet tinctur'd therein, thus retreats, that is, by the continual
appulse of the <hi>Sap,</hi> is in part carried off into the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> back
again, the <hi>Sap</hi> whereof it now tinctures into good <hi>Aliment.</hi> So
that whereas before, the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> was only relaxed in its Parts, and
so dilated; 'tis now increas'd in real quantity or number of parts, and
so is truly nourish'd. And the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> being saturate with so
much of this Vital <hi>Sap</hi> as serves it self; and the second Remainders
discharged thence to the <hi>Skin;</hi> this also is nourish'd and augmented
therewith. So that as in an <hi>Animal Body</hi> there is no instauration or
growth of Parts made by the <hi>Bloud</hi> only, but the <hi>Nervous Spirit</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
thereunto assistant; so is it here: the <hi>Sap</hi> prepared in the <hi>Cortical
Body,</hi> is as the <hi>Bloud,</hi> and that part thereof prepared by the <hi>Lignous,</hi> is
as the <hi>Nervous Spirit;</hi> which partly becoming Nutriment to it self,
and partly being discharged back into the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> and diffusing
its Tincture through the <hi>Sap</hi> there, that to the said <hi>Cortical Body</hi> and
<hi>Skin,</hi> becomes also true Nutriment, and so they all now grow.</p>
                  <p>24. §. In which growth, a proportion in length and breadth is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite:
which being rated by the benefit of the <hi>Plant,</hi> both for firm
standing and sufficient <hi>Sap,</hi> must therefore principally be in length.
And because it is thus requisite, therefore by the constitution of one
of its <hi>Parts, sc.</hi> the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> it is also made necessary. For the
<hi>Pores</hi> hereof, in that they are all extended by its length, the <hi>Sap</hi> also
according to the frame and site of the said <hi>Pores</hi> will principally move;
and that way as its <hi>Sap</hi> moves, the same way will the generation of its
Parts also proceed; <hi>sc.</hi> by its length. And the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> first (that
is by a <hi>priority causal)</hi> moving in length it self; the <hi>Cortical</hi> also moves
therewith. For that which is nourish'd, is extended: but whatever
is extended, is mov'd: that therefore which is nourish'd, is mov'd:
The <hi>Lignous Body</hi> then being first nourish'd, 'tis likewise first mov'd,
and so becomes and carries in it the Principle of all Vegetative motion
in the <hi>Cortical;</hi> and so they both move in length.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:100350:36"/>
25. §. Yet as the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> is the <hi>Principle</hi> of Motion in the
<hi>Cortical;</hi> so the <hi>Cortical</hi> is the <hi>Moderator</hi> of that in the <hi>Lignous:</hi> As in
Animal Motions, the <hi>Principle</hi> is from the <hi>Nerves;</hi> yet being once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the <hi>Muscle</hi> or <hi>Limb,</hi> and that moving proportionably to its stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
the <hi>Nerves</hi> also are carried in the same motion with it. We sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
therefore, that as the principal motion of the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> is in
length, so is its <hi>proper tendency</hi> also to <hi>Ascend.</hi> But being much exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both in Compass and Quantity by the <hi>Cortical,</hi> as in the smaller parts
of the <hi>Root</hi> it is; it must needs therefore be over-born and governed
by it; and so, though not lose its motion, yet make it that way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> may be more obedient to it; which will be by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent.
Yet both of them being sufficiently pliable, they are thus capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
where the Soyl may oppose a direct descent, there to divert any
way, where it is more penetrable, and so to descend obliquely. For
the same reason it may also be, that though you set a <hi>Bean</hi> with the
<hi>Radicle</hi> upward; yet the <hi>Radicle,</hi> as it shoots, declining also gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
is thus arch'd in form of an Hook, and so at last descends. For
every declination from a perpendicular Line, is a mixed motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Ascent and Descent, as that of the <hi>Radicle</hi> also is, and so seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be dependent upon the two <hi>Contrary Tendencies</hi> of the <hi>Lignous</hi>
and <hi>Cortical Bodies.</hi> What may be the cause of those <hi>Tendencies</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
most probably external, and a kind of <hi>Magnetisme)</hi> I shall not make
my Task here to enquire.</p>
                  <p>26. §. Now although the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> by the position and shape
of its <hi>Pores,</hi> principally groweth in length; yet will it in some degree
likewise in breadth: For it cannot be supposed that the purest <hi>Sap</hi> is
all received into the said <hi>Pores;</hi> but that part thereof likewise, staying
about its <hi>Superficial Parts,</hi> is there tinctur'd and agglutinated to them.
And because these <hi>Pores</hi> are prolonged by its length; therefore it is
much more laxe and easily divisible that way; as in slitting a Stick, or
cleaving of Timber, and in cutting and hewing them athwart is also
seen. Whence it comes to pass, that in shooting from the Center to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Circumference, and there finding more room, its said origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Laxity</hi> doth easily in divers places now become greater, and at
length in open <hi>Partments</hi> plainly visible. Betwixt which <hi>Partments,</hi>
the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> being bound in on the one hand, by the surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Skin</hi> and <hi>Moulds,</hi> and pressed upon by the <hi>Lignous</hi> on the other,
must needs insert it self, and so move contrary to it, from the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<hi>towards</hi> the <hi>Center.</hi> Where the said contrary motions continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as begun, they at last meet, unite, and either make or augment the
<hi>Pith.</hi> And thus the <hi>Root</hi> is fram'd, and the <hi>Skin,</hi> the <hi>Cortical</hi> and
<hi>Lignous Bodies,</hi> so as is said, thereunto concurrent. We shall next shew the
use of the two other <hi>Parts, sc.</hi> the <hi>Insertment</hi> and <hi>Pith;</hi> and first of the
<hi>Pith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>27. §. ONE true use of the <hi>Pith</hi> is for the better Advancement of
the <hi>Sap,</hi> whereof I shall speak in the next Chapter. The use I here
observe, is for the quicker and higher Fermentation of the <hi>Sap:</hi> For
although the Fermentation made in the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> was well subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to the first <hi>Vegetations,</hi> yet those more perfect ones in the <hi>Trunk</hi>
which after follow, require a Body more adapted to it, and that is the
<hi>Pith;</hi> which is so necessary, as not to be only common to, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably
large in the <hi>Roots</hi> of most <hi>Plants;</hi> if not in their inferiour
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100350:36"/>
parts, yet at their tops. Where though either deriv'd or amplify'd
from the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> yet being by its <hi>Insertions</hi> only, we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
suppose, as those, so this, to be more finely constituted. And
being also from its coarctation, while inserted, now free; all its <hi>Pores,</hi>
upon the supply of the <hi>Sap,</hi> will more or less be amplified: Upon
which accounts, the <hi>Sap</hi> thereinto received, will be more pure, and
its fermentation therein more active. And as the <hi>Pith</hi> is superiour to
the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> by its <hi>Constitution,</hi> so by its <hi>Place.</hi> For as it thus
stands central, it hath the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> surrounding it. Now as the
<hi>Skin</hi> is the Fence of the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> and that of the <hi>Lignous;</hi> so is
the <hi>Lignous</hi> again a far more preheminent one unto the <hi>Pith;</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi>
being here a brisk Liquor, <hi>tunn'd up</hi> as in a wooden <hi>Cask.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>28. §. And as the <hi>Pith</hi> subserves the higher Fermentation of the
<hi>Sap;</hi> so do the <hi>Insertions</hi> its purer Distribution; that separation which
the parts of the <hi>Sap,</hi> by being fermented in the <hi>Pith,</hi> were dispos'd for;
being, upon its entrance into the <hi>Insertions,</hi> now made: So that as the
<hi>Skin</hi> is a <hi>Filtre</hi> to the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> so are the <hi>Insertions</hi> a more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminent
one to the <hi>Lignous.</hi> And as they subserve the purer, so the
freer and sufficient distribution of the <hi>Sap:</hi> For the <hi>Root</hi> enlarging,
and so the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> growing thicker, although the <hi>Cortical</hi> and the
<hi>Pith</hi> might supply <hi>Sap</hi> sufficient to the nutrition of its <hi>Parts</hi> next adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
to them; yet those more inward, must needs be scanted of their
<hi>Aliment;</hi> and so, if not quite starv'd, yet be uncapable of equal growth:
Whereas the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> being through its whole breadth frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disparted, and the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> inserted through it; the <hi>Sap</hi> by those
<hi>Insertions,</hi> as the <hi>Bloud</hi> by the disseminations of the <hi>Arteries,</hi> is freely
and sufficiently convey'd to its intimate Parts, even those, which from
either the <hi>Barque</hi> or from the <hi>Pith,</hi> are most remote. Lastly, as the
consequent hereof, they are thus assistant to the <hi>Latitudinal growth</hi> of
the <hi>Root;</hi> as the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> to its growth in Length; so these <hi>Inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of the <hi>Cortical,</hi> to its better growth in Breadth.</p>
                  <p>29. §. Having thus seen the solitary uses of the Several <hi>Parts</hi> of
the <hi>Root,</hi> I shall lastly propound my Conjectures of that Design where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they are altogether concurrent, and that is the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the
<hi>Sap.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>30. §. That the <hi>Sap</hi> hath a Double, and so a <hi>Circular</hi> Motion, in
the <hi>Root;</hi> is probable, from the proper Motion of the <hi>Root,</hi> and from
its Office. From its Motion, which is Descent: for which, the <hi>Sap</hi>
must likewise, some where, have such a Motion proper to it. From
its Office, which is, To feed the <hi>Trunk:</hi> for which, the <hi>Sap</hi> must also,
in some <hi>Part</hi> or other, have a more especial Motion of Ascent.</p>
                  <p>31. §. We may therefore suppose, That the <hi>Sap</hi> moving in the
<hi>Barque,</hi> towards the <hi>Pith,</hi> through the <hi>Insertions,</hi> thereinto ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a pass, Which passage, the upper <hi>Insertions</hi> will not favour;
because the <hi>Pith</hi> standing in the same heigth with them, is there large,
the fermenting and course of the <hi>Sap</hi> quick, and so its opposition
strong. But through the lower it will much more easily enter; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there, from the smalness of the <hi>Pith,</hi> the opposition is little, and
from the shortness of the <hi>Insertions,</hi> the way more open. So that the
<hi>Sap</hi> here meeting with the least opposition, here it will bestow it self
(feeding the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> in its passage) into the <hi>Pith.</hi> Into which,
fresh <hi>Sap</hi> still entring, this being yet but crude, will subside: that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100350:37"/>
first receiv'd, and so become a Liquor higher wrought, will more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
mount upwards. And moving in the <hi>Pith,</hi> especially in the <hi>Sap-Fibers</hi>
there dispers'd, as in the <hi>Arterys,</hi> in equal altitude with the upper-<hi>Inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
the most volatile parts of all will still continue their direct as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
towards the <hi>Trunk.</hi> But those of a middle nature, and, as not
apt to ascend, so being lighter than those beneath them, not to descend
neither; they will tend from the <hi>Pith</hi> towards the <hi>Insertions</hi> in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
betwixt both. Through which <hi>Insertions</hi> (feeding the <hi>Lignous
Body</hi> in its passage) it is, by the next subsequent <hi>Sap,</hi> discharged off
into the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> and so into the <hi>Sap-Fibres</hi> themselves, as into
the <hi>Veins,</hi> back again. Wherein, being still pursu'd by fresh <hi>Sap</hi>
from the Center, and more occurring from the Circumference, towards
the lower <hi>Insertions,</hi> it thus descends. Through which, together
with part of the <hi>Sap</hi> afresh imbib'd from the Earth, it re-enters the
<hi>Pith.</hi> From whence, into the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> and from thence into
the <hi>Pith,</hi> the cruder part thereof, is reciprocally disburs'd; while
the most <hi>Volatile,</hi> not needing the help of a <hi>Circulation,</hi> more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ascendeth towards the <hi>Trunk.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING thus declar'd the degrees of <hi>Vegetation</hi>
in the <hi>Root;</hi> the continuance hereof in the <hi>Trunk</hi>
shall next be shew'd: in order to which, the
Parts whereof this likewise is compounded, we
shall first observe.</p>
                  <p>1. §. That which without dissection shews it
self, is the <hi>Coarcture:</hi> I cannot say of the <hi>Root,</hi>
nor of the <hi>Trunk;</hi> but what I choose here to mention, as standing
betwixt them, and so being common to them both; all their <hi>Parts</hi>
being here bound in closer together, as in the tops of the grown <hi>Roots</hi>
of very many <hi>Plants,</hi> is apparent.</p>
                  <p>2. §. Of the <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> the first occurring is its <hi>Skin:</hi>
The Formation whereof, is not from the Air, but in the <hi>Seed,</hi> from
whence it is originated; being the production of the <hi>Cuticle,</hi> there
investing the two <hi>Lobes</hi> and <hi>Plume.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. §. The next <hi>Part</hi> is the <hi>Cortical Body;</hi> which here in the
<hi>Trunk</hi> is no new substantial Formation; but, as is that of the <hi>Root,</hi>
originated from the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Plume</hi> in the <hi>Seed;</hi> and is only
the increase and augmentation thereof.<note place="margin">Tab. 3. f. 1, &amp; 4.</note> The <hi>Skin,</hi> this <hi>Cortical Body</hi>
or <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> and (for the most part) some Fibers of the <hi>Lignous</hi>
mixed herewith, alltogether make the <hi>Barque.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. §. Next, the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> which, whether it be visibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into many softer <hi>Fibers</hi> or small <hi>Threads,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 3. f. 1.</note> as in the <hi>Bean, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi>
and most <hi>Herbs;</hi> or that its Parts stand more compact and close,
shewing one hard, firm and solid piece, as in <hi>Trees;</hi> it is, in all, one
and the same <hi>Body;</hi> and that not formed originally in the <hi>Trunk,</hi>
but in the <hi>Seed;</hi> being nothing else but the prolongation of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
Root</hi> distributed in the <hi>Lobes</hi> and <hi>Plume</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p>5. §. Lastly, The <hi>Insertions</hi> and <hi>Pith</hi> are here originated like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
from the <hi>Plume,</hi> as the same in the <hi>Root,</hi> from the <hi>Radicle:</hi> So
that as to their <hi>Substantial Parts,</hi> the <hi>Lobes</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> the <hi>Radicle</hi>
and <hi>Plume,</hi> the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Trunk</hi> are all one.</p>
                  <p>6. §. Yet some things are more fairly observable in the <hi>Trunk.</hi>
First, the <hi>Latitudinal</hi> shootings of the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> which in <hi>Trunks</hi>
of several years growth, are apparent in so many <hi>Rings,</hi> as is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known.<note place="margin">Tab. 3. f. 5. &amp; 8.</note> For several young Fibers of the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> as in the
<hi>Root,</hi> so here, shooting in the <hi>Cortical</hi> one year, and the spaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them being after fill'd up with more (I think not till) the
next, at length they become altogether a firm compact <hi>Ring;</hi> the
<hi>Perfection</hi> of one <hi>Ring,</hi> and the <hi>Ground-work</hi> of another, being thus
made concomitantly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100350:38"/>
7. §. From these Annual younger <hi>Fibers</hi> it is, that although the
<hi>Cortical Body</hi> and <hi>Pith</hi> are both of the same substantial nature, and
their <hi>Pores</hi> little different; yet whereas the <hi>Pith,</hi> which the first year
is green, and of all the <hi>Parts</hi> the fullest of <hi>Sap,</hi> becomes afterwards
white and dry: The <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> on the contrary, so long as the
<hi>Tree</hi> grows, ever keepeth green and moist, <hi>sc.</hi> because the said <hi>Sap-Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
annually grow therein, and so communicate with it.</p>
                  <p>8. §. The <hi>Pores</hi> likewise of the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> many of them,
in well-grown Timber, as in Oaken boards, are very conspicuous,
in cutting both lengthwise and traverse. They very seldom, if ever,
run one into another, but keep, like so many several <hi>Vessels,</hi> all along
distinct;<note place="margin">Tab. 3. f. 2. &amp; 3.</note> as by cutting, and so following any one of them as far as
you please, for a Foot or half a Yard, or more together, may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd.
And so, the like, in any <hi>Cane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. §. Besides these, there are a lesser sort; which, by the help
only of a good <hi>Spectacle Glass</hi> may be observ'd.</p>
                  <p>10. §. And these are all the <hi>Pores</hi> visible without a <hi>Microscope.</hi>
The use of which, excepting in some few particulars, I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
omitted in this first <hi>Book.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Micrography.</note> Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> sheweth us, besides these,
a third, and yet smaller Sort; and (as a confirmation of what, in
the Second <hi>Chapter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">C. 2. §. 8.</note> I have said of the <hi>Pores</hi> of the <hi>Lignous Body</hi>
in general) that they are all continuous and prolonged by the length
of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> as are the greater ones: whereof he maketh Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by filling up, in a piece of <hi>Char-coal,</hi> all the said <hi>Pores</hi> with
<hi>Mercury:</hi> which appears to pass quite through them, in that by a
very good <hi>Glass</hi> it is visible in their Orifices at both ends; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>Glass,</hi> by the weight of the Coal alone, is also manifest. All
these I have seen, with the help of a good <hi>Microscope,</hi> in several
sorts of <hi>Woods.</hi> As they all appeare in a piece of <hi>Oak,</hi> cut trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versely,<note place="margin">Tab. 3. f. 7.</note>
See <hi>Tab.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>11. §. Upon further Enquiry, I likewise find, That the <hi>Pores</hi>
of the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> in the <hi>Trunks</hi> of <hi>Herbs,</hi> which at first I only sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
by the help of good <hi>Glasses,</hi> are very fairly visible: each <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre</hi>
being sometimes perforated by 30, 50, 100, or hundreds of <hi>Pores.</hi>
Or what I think is the truest notion of them, That each <hi>Fibre,</hi> though
it seem to the bare eye to be but <hi>one,</hi> yet is, indeed, a great number
of <hi>Fibres</hi> together; and every <hi>Pore,</hi> being not meerly a space betwixt
the several parts of the Wood, but the <hi>Concave</hi> of a <hi>Fiber.</hi> So that
if it be asked, what all that Part of a <hi>Plant,</hi> either <hi>Herb</hi> or <hi>Tree,</hi> which
is properly called the <hi>Woody-Part;</hi> what all that is, I suppose, That
it is nothing else but a <hi>Cluster</hi> of innumerable and most extraordinary
small <hi>Vessels</hi> or <hi>Concave Fibers:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 3. f. 6.</note> as in a Slice of the Trunk of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock</hi>
is apparent.</p>
                  <p>12. §. Next the <hi>Insertions</hi> of the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> which in the
<hi>Trunk</hi> of a <hi>Tree</hi> saw'd athawrt, are plainly discerned as they run
from the Circumference toward the Center; the whole Body of
the <hi>Tree</hi> being visibly compounded of two distinct Substances, that of
the several <hi>Rings,</hi> and that of the <hi>Insertions,</hi> running cross; shewing
that in some resemblance in a <hi>Plain,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 3. f. 5. &amp; 8.</note> which the <hi>Lines</hi> of <hi>Latitude</hi> and
of the <hi>Meridian</hi> do in a <hi>Globe.</hi> The entrance of the <hi>Insertions</hi> into
the <hi>Wood,</hi> is also, upon striping off the Barque, very apparent; as
in the same <hi>Fig.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:100350:38"/>
13. §. These <hi>Insertions</hi> are likewise very conspicuous in Sawing
of <hi>Trees</hi> length-ways into Boards, and those plain'd, and wrought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Leaves</hi> for <hi>Tables, Wainscot, Trenchers,</hi> and the like. In all which,
as in course <hi>Trenchers</hi> made of <hi>Beech,</hi> and <hi>Tables</hi> of <hi>Oak,</hi> there are
many parts which have a greater smoothness than the rest;<note place="margin">Tab. 3. f. 2. &amp; Tab. 4. f. 1.</note> and are so
many <hi>inserted Pieces</hi> of the <hi>Cortical Body;</hi> which being by those of
the <hi>Lignous,</hi> frequently intercepted, seem to be discontinuous, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in the <hi>Trunk</hi> they are really extended, in continued Plates,
throughout its Breadth.</p>
                  <p>14. §. These <hi>Insertions,</hi> although as is said, of a quite distinct
substance from the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> and so no where truly incorporated
with it, yet being they are in all parts, the one as the <hi>Warp,</hi> the
other as the <hi>Woof,</hi> mutually <hi>braced</hi> and <hi>interwoven</hi> together, they
thus constitute one strong and firmly coherent Body;<note place="margin">Tab. 4. f. 1.</note> as the Timber
of any <hi>Tree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. §. As the Pores or Vessels are greater or less, so are the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions</hi>
also: To the bare eye usually the greater only are discerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
But through an indifferent <hi>Microscope</hi> there are others also, much
more both numerous and small, distinctly apparent, as in a transverse
piece of <hi>Oak.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 3. f. 7.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>16. §. In none of all the <hi>Pores</hi> can we observe any thing which
may have the true nature and use of <hi>Valves,</hi> which is, Easily to admit
that, to which they will by no means allow a regress. And their non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence
is enough evident,<note place="margin">C. 1. §. 42.</note> from what in the first <hi>Chapter</hi> we have
said of the <hi>Lobes</hi> of the <hi>Seed:</hi> in whose <hi>Seminal Root,</hi> were there any
<hi>Valves,</hi> it could not be, that by a contrary <hi>Course</hi> of the <hi>Sap,</hi> they
should ever grow; which yet, where-ever they turn into <hi>Dissimilar
Leaves,</hi> they do. Or if we consider the growth of the <hi>Root,</hi> which
oftentimes is <hi>upward</hi> and <hi>downward</hi> both at once. And being cut
transversely, will bleed, both the same ways, with equal freedom.</p>
                  <p>17. §. The <hi>Insertions</hi> here in the <hi>Trunk</hi> give us likewise a sight
of the position of their <hi>Pores.</hi> For in a plained piece of <hi>Oak,</hi> as
in <hi>Wainscot, Tables, &amp;c.</hi> besides the larger <hi>Pores</hi> of the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi>
which run by the <hi>length</hi> of the <hi>Trunk;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 3. f. 2.</note> the <hi>Tract</hi> likewise of those of
the <hi>Insertions</hi> may be observed to be made by the breadth, and so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
cross. Nor are they continuous as those of the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi>
but very short, as those both of the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> and <hi>Pith,</hi> with
which the <hi>Insertions,</hi> as to their substance, are congenerous. Yet they
all stand so together, as to be plainly ranked in even <hi>Lines</hi> or <hi>Rows</hi>
throughout the breadth of the <hi>Trunk:</hi> As the <hi>Tract</hi> of those <hi>Pores</hi>
appears to the naked Eye, see in <hi>Tab. 3. Fig.</hi> 9. The <hi>Pores</hi> themselves
may be seen in the <hi>Root</hi> of a <hi>Vine</hi> described and figured in the Second
<hi>Book,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 17.</note> as it appears through a good <hi>Microscope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. §. The <hi>Pores</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> likewise being larger here in the
<hi>Trunk,</hi> are better observable than in the <hi>Root:</hi> the width whereof,
in comparison with their <hi>Sides</hi> so exquisitely thin, may by an <hi>Hony-Comb</hi>
be grosly exemplified; and is that also which the vast dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
betwixt the Bulk and Weight of a dry <hi>Pith</hi> doth enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.
In the <hi>Trunks</hi> of some <hi>Plants,</hi> they are so ample and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
that in cutting both by the length and breadth of the <hi>Pith,</hi>
some of them through the transparency of the <hi>Skins</hi> by which they
are bounded, or of which they consist, would seem to be considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100350:39"/>
extended by the length of the <hi>Pith;</hi> but are really disconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
and short, and as 'tis said, somewhat answerable to the <hi>Cells</hi>
of an <hi>Hony-Comb.</hi> This is the nearest we can come to them, by the
bare Eye without the assistance of a good <hi>Microscope.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hook</hi>
sheweth in his <hi>Micrography,</hi> That the <hi>Pores</hi> of the <hi>Pith,</hi> particularly of
<hi>Elder-Pith,</hi> so far as they are visible, are all alike discontinuous; and
that the <hi>Pith</hi> is nothing else but (as he calls them) an heap of <hi>Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi>
Although, in regard they are not fluid, but fixed Parts, I shall
choose rather to call them, <hi>Bladders.</hi> As they appear through a good
<hi>Glass,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 3. f. 6.</note> in a piece of <hi>Burdock,</hi> See in <hi>Tab.</hi> 3. But a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Description of the <hi>Sizes, Figures,</hi> and admirable <hi>Textures</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I have given in several places in the following <hi>Books.</hi>

                  <p>19. §. Besides what this Observation informs us of here,<note place="margin">C. 2. §. 3, 16, 17.</note> it
farther confirms what in the Second <hi>Chapter</hi> we have said of the
Original of the <hi>Pith</hi> and <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> and of the sameness of
both their natures with the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Seed:</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but a Mass of <hi>Bladders;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">C. 1. §. 18. &amp; Tab. 1. f. 9.</note> as in the First <hi>Chapter</hi> hath been
said.</p>
                  <p>20. §. In the <hi>Piths</hi> of many <hi>Plants,</hi> the greater <hi>Pores</hi> or <hi>Bladders</hi>
have some of them lesser ones within them, and some of them are
divided with cross Membranes: And betwixt their several sides, have, I
think, other smaller <hi>Bladders</hi> visibly interjected. However, that
they are all permeable, is most certain. They stand together not confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly,
but in even <hi>Ranks</hi> or <hi>Trains;</hi> as those of the <hi>Insertions</hi> by the
breadth, so these by the length of the <hi>Trunk.</hi> And thus far there is a
general corresponding betwixt the parts of the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Trunk.</hi> Yet
are there some considerable Disparities betwixt them; wherein, and
how they come to pass, and to what especial Use and End, shall next
be said.</p>
                  <p>21. §. WE SAY then,<note place="margin">An Account of the <hi>Growth</hi> of the <hi>Trunk.</hi>
                     </note> that the <hi>Sap</hi> being in the <hi>Root</hi> by Filtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Fermentations (and in what <hi>Roots</hi> needful, perhaps by Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
also) duly prepar'd; the prime part thereof passing through
the intermediate <hi>Coarcture,</hi> in due moderation and purity is entertain'd
at last into the <hi>Trunk.</hi> And the <hi>Sap</hi> of the <hi>Trunk</hi> being purer and
more volatile, and so it self apt to ascend; the motion of the <hi>Trunk</hi>
likewise will be more noble, receiving a disposition and tendency to
ascend therewith. And what by the <hi>Sap</hi> the <hi>Trunk</hi> is in part dipos'd
to, by the respective position and quantity of its Parts it is effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enabled. For whereas in the <hi>Root</hi> the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> being in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
with the <hi>Cortical,</hi> but little, and all lying close within its
Center; it must therefore needs be under its controul: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
being here comparatively of greater quantity, and also more
dilated, and having divers of its Branches standing more abroad towards
the Circumference, as both in the <hi>Leaves</hi> and Body of the young <hi>Trunk</hi>
and <hi>Plume,</hi> is seen; it will in its own <hi>magnetical</hi> tendency to <hi>ascend,</hi>
reduce the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> to a compliance with it.</p>
                  <p>22. §. And the <hi>Trunk</hi> thus standing from under the restraint of the
Ground in the open Air, the disposition of its <hi>Parts,</hi> originally different
from that of the <hi>Parts</hi> in the <hi>Root,</hi> will not only be continued, but
improved. For by the force and pressure of the <hi>Sap</hi> in its collateral
Motion, the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> will now more freely and farther be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100350:39"/>
And this being dilated, the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> also, must needs be
<hi>inserted;</hi> and is therefore in proportion always, more or less, smaller
here in the <hi>Trunk,</hi> than in the <hi>Root.</hi> And as the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> lessens,
so the <hi>Pith</hi> will be enlarged, and by the same proportion is here
greater. And the <hi>Pith</hi> being enlarged it self, its <hi>Pores</hi> (the <hi>Lignous
Body,</hi> upon its dilatation, as it were tentering and stretching out all
their sides) must needs likewise be enlarged with it; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
are ever greater in the <hi>Pith</hi> of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> than of the <hi>Root.</hi>
And the dilatation of the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> still continued, it follows,
that whereas the <hi>Pith</hi> descendent in the <hi>Root,</hi> is not only in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
less and less, but also in the smaller extremities thereof, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
higher, altogether absent: Contrariwise, in the <hi>Trunk,</hi> it is
not only continued to its top and smallest <hi>Twigs,</hi> but also there, in
proportion, equally ample with what it is in any other inferiour
part.</p>
                  <p>23. §. But although the openness of the Aer permitting, be all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
alike; yet the Energy of the <hi>Sap</hi> effecting, being different; as
therefore that doth, the dilatation of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> will also vary. If
that be less, so is this; as in the <hi>Trunks</hi> of most <hi>Trees:</hi> If that be
greater, so this; as in <hi>Herbs</hi> is common; the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> being usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
so far dilated, that the <hi>utmost Shootings</hi> thereof may easily be
seen to jut out, and adjoyn to the <hi>Skin.</hi> And if the <hi>Sap</hi> be still of
greater energy, it so far dilates the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> as not only to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie
the <hi>Pith</hi> and all its <hi>Pores;</hi> but also so far to stretch them out,
as to make them tear. Whereupon either running again into the
<hi>Cortical Body,</hi> or shrinking up towards it, the <hi>Trunk</hi> thus sometimes
becomes an <hi>hallow Stalk,</hi> the <hi>Pith</hi> being wholly, or in part voided.
But generally it keeps entire; and where it doth, the same proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and respect to the <hi>Lignous</hi> and <hi>Cortical Bodies,</hi> as is said. The
Consequences of all which will be, the <hi>Strength</hi> of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi>
and <hi>Plenty</hi> of the <hi>Sap,</hi> its <hi>Fermentation</hi> will be quicker, its <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution</hi>
more effectual, and its <hi>Advancement</hi> more sufficient.</p>
                  <p>24. §. First, the Erect Growth and Strength of the <hi>Trunk;</hi> this
being, by the position of its several Parts, effected: for besides the slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of the <hi>Trunk</hi> still towards the top, the <hi>Circumferential</hi> position
of the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> likewise is, and that eminently, hereunto subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
So that as the <hi>Lignous, Body,</hi> in the smaller parts, of the <hi>Root</hi>
standing Central, we may thence conceive and see their pliableness to
any oblique motion; so here, on the contrary, the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
wide, it thus becomes the Strength of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> and most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to its Perpendicular Growth. We see the same Design in
<hi>Bones</hi> and <hi>Feathers:</hi> The strongest <hi>Bones,</hi> as those in the Legs, are
hollow. Now should we suppose the same <hi>Bone,</hi> to be contracted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Solid; although now it would be no heavier, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
as apt for motion; yet would it have far less strength, than as
its Parts are dilated to a <hi>Circumferential</hi> posture. And so for <hi>Quills,</hi>
which, for the same Reasons, in subserviency to flying, as they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
light; So, in comparison with the thinness of their <hi>Sides,</hi> they
are very strong, and much less apt to bend, than if contracted into a
Solid <hi>Cylinder.</hi> We see it not only in <hi>Nature,</hi> but <hi>Art.</hi> For hence it
is, that <hi>Joyners</hi> and <hi>Carpenters.</hi> unite and set together their Timber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces
and several Works oftentimes with double Joynts; which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100350:40"/>
they are no thicker, than a single one might be made; yet stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at a distance, have a greater strength than That could have. And
the same Architecture, will have the same use, in the <hi>Trunks</hi> of <hi>Plants;</hi>
in most whereof 'tis very apparent; as for instance, in <hi>Corn.</hi> For
<hi>Nature</hi> designing its <hi>Sap</hi> a great Ascent; for its higher maturity, hath
given it a tall <hi>Trunk:</hi> But to prevent its ravenous despoiling either of
the <hi>Ear,</hi> or <hi>Soyl;</hi> although it be tall, yet are its sides but thin: And
because again, it should grow not only tall and thriftily, but for avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
propping up, strongly too; therefore, the same proportion as its
heigth bears, to the thinness of its sides, doth the greatness of its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
also; being so far dilated as to parallel a <hi>Quil</hi> it self.</p>
                  <p>25. §. Besides the position of the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> within the compass
of a <hi>Ring,</hi> there are some <hi>Shootings</hi> thereof, often standing beyond
the Circumference of the said <hi>Ring,</hi> making sometimes a triangular,
oftner a quadrangular Body of the <hi>Trunk.</hi> To the end, that the <hi>Ring,</hi>
being but thin, and not self-sufficient, these, like <hi>Splinters</hi> to <hi>Bones,</hi>
might add strength and stability to it.</p>
                  <p>26. §. Next, the security and plenty of the <hi>Sap.</hi> For should the
<hi>Lignous Body,</hi> as it doth in the smaller Parts of the <hi>Root,</hi> stand Central
here also, and so the <hi>Cortical</hi> wholly surround it: the greater part of
the <hi>Sap</hi> would thus be more immediately expos'd to the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Aer;</hi>
and being lodged in a laxe Body, by them continually be prey'd upon,
and as fast as supplied to the <hi>Trunk,</hi> be exhausted. Whereas, the <hi>Pith</hi>
standing in the Center, the <hi>Sap</hi> therein being not only most remote from
the <hi>Aer</hi> and <hi>Sun,</hi> but by the <hi>Barque,</hi> and especially the <hi>Wood,</hi> being
also surrounded and doubly immur'd, will very securely and copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
be convey'd to all the Collateral Parts, and (as shall be said
how) the top of the <hi>Trunk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>27. §. And the <hi>Sap</hi> by the amplitude, and great porosity of the
<hi>Pith,</hi> being herein more copious, its Fermentation also will be quicker;
which we see in all Liquors, by standing in a greater quantity toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
proceeds more kindly: And being <hi>tun'd up</hi> within the <hi>Wood,</hi>
is at the same time not only secur'd from loss, but all extream mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
the Day being thus, not too hot; nor the Night, too cold for
it.</p>
                  <p>28. §. And the Fermentation hereof being quicker, its motion
also will be stronger, and its Distribution more effectual, not only to
the dilatation of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> but likewise the shooting out of the
<hi>Branches.</hi> Whence it is, that in the Bodies of <hi>Trees,</hi> the <hi>Barque</hi> of it
self, though it be Sappy, and many <hi>Fibres</hi> of the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with it, yet seldom sendeth forth any; and that in <hi>Herbs,</hi> those
with the least <hi>Pith</hi> (other advantages not supplying this defect) have
the fewest or smallest Branches, or other collateral Growths: and that
<hi>Corn,</hi> which hath no <hi>Pith,</hi> hath neither any Branches.</p>
                  <p>29. §. Lastly, the Advancement of the <hi>Sap</hi> will hence also be
more ready and sufficient. For the understanding where, and how,
we suppose, That in all <hi>Trunks</hi> whatsoever there are two Parts joyntly
hereunto subservient. In some, the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> and the <hi>Cortical,</hi> as
in older <hi>Trunks;</hi> the <hi>Pith</hi> being either excluded, or dried: But in
most, principally, the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> and <hi>Pith;</hi> as in most Annual
Growths of <hi>Trees;</hi> but especially <hi>Herbs,</hi> where the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> is
usually much and often wholly Inserted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:100350:40"/>
30. §. Of the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> it is so apparent by its <hi>Pores,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by its <hi>Vessels,</hi> that we need no farther Evidence. For to what
end are <hi>Vessels,</hi> but for the conveyance of Liquor? And is that also,
which upon cutting the young Branch of a Sappy <hi>Tree</hi> or <hi>Herb,</hi> by
an accurate and steady view may be observed. But when I say
the <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> I mean principally them of the
<hi>younger shootings,</hi> both those which make the <hi>new Ring,</hi> and those
which are mixed with the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> in the <hi>Barque:</hi> that which
ascendeth by the <hi>Pores</hi> or <hi>Vessels</hi> of the Wood, being probably, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in less quantity, more in form of a <hi>Vapour,</hi> than a <hi>Liquor.</hi> Yet
that which drenching into the sides of its <hi>Pores,</hi> is with all thereunto
sufficient Aliment; as we see <hi>Orpine, Onions, &amp;c.</hi> only standing in
a moyster Aer will often grow. And being likewise in part supplied
by the <hi>Insertions</hi> from the younger <hi>Shoots:</hi> But especially because as
it is but little, so (considered as Aliment) it serveth only for the
growth of the <hi>Wood,</hi> and no more; whereas, the more copious Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ascendent by the younger <hi>Shoots,</hi> subserves not only their own
growth, but the generation of others; and is besides with that in the
<hi>Cortical Body</hi> the Fountain of <hi>Perspirations,</hi> which we know even in
<hi>Animals</hi> are much more abundant than the <hi>Nutritive Parts;</hi> and
doubtless in a <hi>Vegetable</hi> are still much more.</p>
                  <p>31. §. But these <hi>Pores,</hi> although they are a free and open way
to the ascending <hi>Sap;</hi> yet that meer <hi>Pores</hi> or <hi>Vessels</hi> should be able of
themselves to advance the <hi>Sap</hi> with that speed, strength and plenty,
and to that height, as is necessary, cannot probably be supposed. It
follows then, that herein we must grant the <hi>Pith</hi> a joynt service. And
why else is the <hi>Pith</hi> in all Primitive <hi>Growths</hi> the most <hi>Sappy</hi> part, why
hath it so great a stock of <hi>Sap,</hi> if not, after due maturation within it
self, still to be disbursed into the <hi>Fibres</hi> of the <hi>Lignous Body?</hi> Why
are the Annual <hi>Growths</hi> of all both <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Trees,</hi> with great <hi>Piths,</hi>
the quickest and the longest? But how are the <hi>Pores</hi> or <hi>Bladders</hi>
of the <hi>Pith</hi> permeable? That they are so, both from their being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of a repletion with <hi>Sap,</hi> and of being again wholly emptied of
it, and again, instead thereof fill'd with <hi>Aer,</hi> is as certain as that they
are <hi>Pores.</hi> That they are permeable, by the breadth, appears from
the dilatation of the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> and from the production of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
as hath been, and shall hereafter be said. And how else is there
a Communion betwixt <hi>This</hi> and the <hi>Cortical Body?</hi> That they are so
also, by the length, is probable, because by the best <hi>Microscope</hi> we
cannot yet observe, that they are visibly more open by the breadth,
than by the length. And withall are ranked by the length, as those
of the <hi>Insertions</hi> by the breadth of the <hi>Trunk.</hi> But if you set a
piece of dry <hi>Elder-Pith</hi> in some tinged Liquor, why then doth it
not penetrate the <hi>Pores,</hi> so as to ascend through the Body of the <hi>Pith?</hi>
The plain reason is, because they are all fill'd with <hi>Aer.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Pith</hi>
in a Vegetating <hi>Plant,</hi> as its Parts or <hi>Bladders</hi> are still generated, they
are at the same time also fill'd with <hi>Sap;</hi> which, as 'tis gradually spent,
is still repaired by more succeeding, and so the <hi>Aer</hi> still kept out; as in
all Primitive <hi>Growths,</hi> and the <hi>Pith</hi> of <hi>Elder</hi> it self: Yet the same <hi>Pith,</hi>
by reason of the following Winter, wanting a more copious and quick
supply of <hi>Sap,</hi> thus once become, ever after keeps dry. And since in the
aforesaid Trial the Liquor only ascends by the sides of the <hi>Pith,</hi> that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100350:41"/>
is of its broken <hi>Bladder,</hi> we should thence by the same reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that they are not penetrable by the breadth neither, and so no
way; and then it need not be ask'd what would follow. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the <hi>Sap</hi> in the <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> is discharged and repaired
every moment, as by its shriv'ling up, upon cutting the <hi>Plant,</hi> is evident.</p>
                  <p>32. §. We suppose then, that as the <hi>Sap</hi> ascendeth into the <hi>Trunk</hi>
by the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> so partly also by the <hi>Pith.</hi> For a piece of <hi>Cotton</hi>
with one end immers'd in some tinged Liquor, and with the other
erect above, though it will not imbibe the Liquor so far as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
at the top, yet so as to advance towards it, it will. So here, the
<hi>Pith,</hi> being a porous and spongy Body, and in its Vegetating state, its
<hi>Pores</hi> or <hi>Bladders</hi> being also permeable, as a curious <hi>Filtre</hi> of <hi>Natures</hi>
own contrivance, it thus advanceth, or as people use to say, sucks up
the <hi>Sap.</hi> Yet as it is seen of the Liquor in the <hi>Cotton;</hi> so likewise are
we to suppose it of the <hi>Sap</hi> in the <hi>Pith;</hi> that though it riseth up for
some way, yet is their some term, beyond which it riseth not, and
towards which the motion of the ascending <hi>Sap</hi> is more and more bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
weak and slow, and so the quantity thereof less and less. But
because the <hi>Sap</hi> moveth not only by the length, but breadth of
the <hi>Pith;</hi> at the same time therefore as it partly ascendeth by the
<hi>Pith,</hi> it is likewise in part pressed into the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> or into its
<hi>Pores.</hi> And since the motion of the <hi>Sap</hi> by the breadth of the <hi>Pith</hi>
not being far continued, and but collateral, is more prone and easie,
than the perpendicular, or by its length; it therefore follows, that
the collateral motion of the <hi>Sap,</hi> at such a height or part of the
<hi>Pith,</hi> will be equally strong with the perpendicular at another part,
though somewhat beneath it; and that where the perpendicular is
more broken and weak, the collateral will be less; and consequently
where the perpendicular tendency of the <hi>Sap</hi> hath its term, the colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
tendency thereof, and so its pressure into the <hi>Pores</hi> or <hi>Vessels</hi> of
the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> will still continue. Through which, in that they
are small, and so their sides almost contiguous, the <hi>Sap</hi> as fast as pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into them will easily run up; as in very small Glasse Pipes, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the two halves of a Stick first slit, and then tyed somewhat loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
together, may also any Liquor be observed to do. By which Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
the facility and strength of that ascent will be continued
higher in the said <hi>Vessels,</hi> than in the <hi>Pith.</hi> Yet since this also, as
well as that in the <hi>Pith</hi> will have its term; the <hi>Sap,</hi> although got
thus far, would at last be stagnant, or at least its ascent be very spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
slow and feeble, if not some way or other re-inforced. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as the <hi>Sap</hi> moving by the breadth of the <hi>Pith,</hi> presseth thence
into the <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Lignous Body;</hi> so having well fill'd these, is
in part by the same Collateral motion disbursed back, into a yet
higher Region of the <hi>Pith.</hi> By which partly, and partly, by that por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Sap,</hi> which in its perpendicular ascent was before lodged
therein; 'tis thus here, as in any inferiour place equally replenished.
Whereupon the force and vigour of the perpendicular motion of the
<hi>Sap</hi> herein, will likewise be renew'd; and so its Collateral motion also,
and so its pressure into the <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> and consequently
its ascent therein: and so by a pressure, from these into the <hi>Pith,</hi> and
from the <hi>Pith</hi> into these, reciprocally carried on; a most ready and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
ascent of the <hi>Sap</hi> will be continued, from the bottom to the top,
though of the highest <hi>Tree.</hi>

                     <head>An Appendix. Of Trunk-Roots and Claspers.</head>
                     <p>THE distinct <hi>Parts</hi> whereof these are composed, are the same
with those of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> and but the continuation of them.</p>
                     <p>1. §. <hi>Trunk-Roots</hi> are of two kinds: Of the one, are those that
vegetate by a direct descent: The place of their Eruption is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
all along the <hi>Trunk;</hi> as in <hi>Mint,</hi> &amp;c. Sometimes only at its
utmost point, as in the <hi>Bramble.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. 2. The other sort are such as neither ascend nor descend, but
shoot forth at right Angles with the <hi>Trunk;</hi> which therefore, though
as to their <hi>Office,</hi> they are true <hi>Roots,</hi> yet as to their <hi>Nature,</hi> they are
a <hi>Middle Thing</hi> betwixt a <hi>Root</hi> and a <hi>Trunk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. <hi>Claspers,</hi> though they are but of one kind, yet their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is double; not a mean betwixit that of the <hi>Root</hi> and that of the
<hi>Trunk,</hi> but a compound of both; as in their Circumvolutions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they often mutually ascend and descend, is seen.</p>
                     <p>4. §. The use of these <hi>Parts</hi> may be observed as the <hi>Trunk</hi> Mounts,
or as it Trails. In the mounting of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> they are for Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and Supply. For Support, we see the <hi>Claspers</hi> of <hi>Vines:</hi> the
<hi>Branches</hi> whereof being very long, fragile and slender; unless by
their <hi>Claspers,</hi> they were mutually contain'd together, they must
needs by their own weight, and that of their Fruit, undecently fall;
and be also liable to frequent breaking. So that the whole care
is divided betwixt the Gardener and Nature; the Gardener, with
his Ligaments of Leather, secures the main Branches; and Nature,
with these of her own finding, secures the Less. Their Conveniency
to which end, is seen in their <hi>Circumvolutions,</hi> a motion, not proper
to any other <hi>Part:</hi> As also in their toughness, though much more
slender than the <hi>Branches</hi> whereon they are appendent.</p>
                     <p>5 §. The <hi>Claspers</hi> of <hi>Bryony</hi> have a retrograde motion about eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Third <hi>Circle,</hi> to the form a Doublet-Clasp. Probably for the more
certain hold; which, if it miss one way, it may be sure to take
another.</p>
                     <p>6. §. For Supply, we see the <hi>Trunk-Roots</hi> of <hi>Ivy.</hi> For mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very high, and being of a closer or more compact Substance than
that of a <hi>Vine;</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> could not be sufficiently supplied to the upper
<hi>Sprouts,</hi> unless these, to the <hi>Mother-Root,</hi> were joyntly assistant. Yet
serve they for support likewise; whence they shoot out, not as in
<hi>Cresses, Brook-lime,</hi> &amp;c. recipocrally on each side, but commonly, all
on one; that so they may be fastned at the nearest hand.</p>
                     <p>7. §. In the Trailing of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> they serve for stabiliment,
propagation and shade. For stabiliment, the <hi>Claspers</hi> of <hi>Cucumbers</hi>
are of good use. For the <hi>Trunk</hi> and <hi>Branches</hi> being long and fragile,
the Brushes of the Winds would injuriously hoise them to and fro, to
the dammage both of themselves and their tender Fruits, were
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100350:42"/>
they not by these Ligaments brought to good Association and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement.</p>
                     <p>8. §. As for this end, so for Propagation, the <hi>Trunk-Roots</hi> of
<hi>Chamaemile</hi> do well serve. Whence we have the reason of the common
observation, that it grows better by being trod upon: the Mould,
where too laxe, being thus made to lie more conveniently about the
said <hi>Trunk-Roots</hi> newly bedded therein; and is that which is sometimes
also effected in Rowling of <hi>Corn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. For both these ends, Serve the <hi>Trunk-Roots</hi> of <hi>Strawberries;</hi>
as also for shade; for in that all <hi>Strawberries</hi> delight; and by the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the <hi>Plant</hi> is well obtain'd. So that as we are wont to tangle
the Twigs of <hi>Trees</hi> together to make an <hi>Arbour Artificial;</hi> the same
is here done to make a <hi>Natural one:</hi> as likewise by the <hi>Claspers</hi> of
<hi>Cucumbers.</hi> For the <hi>Branches</hi> of the one by the Linking of their
<hi>Claspers,</hi> and of the other by the Tethering of their <hi>Trunk-Roots,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
couched together; their tender Fruits thus lie under the Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage
of a <hi>Bower</hi> made of their own Leaves.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. Of the GERMEN, BRANCH, and LEAF.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Parts of the <hi>Germen</hi> and <hi>Branch,</hi> are the
same with those of the <hi>Trunk;</hi> the same <hi>Skin,
Cortical</hi> and <hi>Lignous Bodies, Insertment</hi> and <hi>Pith,</hi>
hereinto propagated, and distinctly observable
herein.</p>
                  <p>2. §. For upon Enquiry into the Original
of a <hi>Branch</hi> or <hi>Germen,</hi> it appears, That it
is not from the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the <hi>Trunk;</hi> but
so deep, as to take, with the <hi>Cortical,</hi> the
<hi>Lignous Body</hi> into it self: and that, not only from its Circumference,
but from in <hi>Inner</hi> or <hi>Central Parts;</hi> So as to take the <hi>Pith</hi> in
also. Divers of which <hi>Parts</hi> may commonly be seen to shoot out
into the <hi>Pith;</hi> from which <hi>Shoots,</hi> the surrounding and more superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<hi>Germens</hi> are originated; in like manner as the Succulent Part of
the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> of the <hi>Trunk</hi> is sometimes principally from those Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous
<hi>Shoots</hi> which run along the <hi>Pith</hi> in the <hi>Root.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. §. The manner wherein usually the <hi>Germen</hi> and <hi>Branch</hi> are fram'd,
is briefly thus: The <hi>Sap</hi> (as is said, <hi>Chap. 3.)</hi> mounting in the <hi>Trunk,</hi>
will not only by its length, but by its breadth also, through the <hi>Insertions</hi>
partly move. Yet, its Particles being not all alike qualified, in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
degrees. Some are more gross and sluggish; of which we have the
formation of a Circle of Wood only, or of an <hi>Annual Ring.</hi> Others are
more brisk; and by these, we have the <hi>Germen</hi> propagated. For by
the vigour of their own motion from the Center, they impress an equal
tendency on some of the inner <hi>Portions</hi> of the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> next adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100350:42"/>
to the <hi>Pith,</hi> to move with them. And since the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> is
not entire, but frequently disparted; through these <hi>Dispartments,</hi> the
said interiour <hi>Portions,</hi> upon their Nutrition, actually shoot; not
only towards the Circumference, so as to make part of a <hi>Ring;</hi> but even
beyond it, in order to the production of a <hi>Germen.</hi> And the <hi>Lignous
Body</hi> thus moving, and carrying the <hi>Cortical</hi> along with it; they both
make a force upon the <hi>Skin.</hi> Yet their motion being most even and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual,
that force is such likewise; not to cause the least breach of its
parts, but gently to carry it on with themselves; and so partly, by
the extension of its already existent parts, as of those of <hi>Gold</hi> in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Guilded <hi>Wyer;</hi> and partly, by the accretion of new ones, as in
the enlarging of a <hi>Bubble</hi> above the Surface of the Water; it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with them to their utmost growth. In which growth, the
<hi>Germen</hi> being prolonged, and so displaying its several parts, as when
a <hi>Prospective</hi> or <hi>Telescope</hi> is drawn out, thus becomes a <hi>Branch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. §. The same way as the propagation of the <hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Germen</hi> is
contriv'd, is its due nutrition also. For being originated from the
inner part of the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> 'tis nourished with the best fermented
<hi>Sap</hi> in the <hi>Trunk, sc.</hi> that next adjacent to it in the <hi>Pith.</hi> Besides,
since all its <hi>Parts,</hi> upon their shooting forth, divaricate from their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular,
to a cross Line, as these and the other grow and thrive
together, they bind and throng each other into a <hi>Knot:</hi> through
which <hi>Knot</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> being strain'd, 'tis thus, in due moderation and
purity delivered up into the <hi>Branch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. §. And for <hi>Knots,</hi> they are so necessary, as to be seen not
only where collaterl <hi>Branches</hi> put forth; but in such <hi>Plants</hi> also, as
shoot up in one single <hi>Trunk;</hi> as in <hi>Corn.</hi> Wherein, as they make
for the strength of the <hi>Trunk;</hi> so by so many percolations, as they
are <hi>Knots,</hi> for the trasmission of the <hi>Sap</hi> more and more refined
towards the <hi>Ear.</hi> So that the two general uses of <hi>Knots</hi> are, For
<hi>fimer standing,</hi> and <hi>finer growth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. §. Lastly, as the due Formation and Nutrition of the <hi>Germen</hi>
are provided for, so is its security also; which both in its position upon
the <hi>Trunk,</hi> and that of its <hi>Parts</hi> among themselves, may be observed.
The position of its <hi>Parts</hi> shall be considered in speakimg of the
<hi>Leaf.</hi> As to its standing in the <hi>Trunk,</hi> tis alwayes betwixt the
<hi>trunk</hi> or <hi>older Branch,</hi> and the <hi>Basis</hi> of the Stalk of <hi>a Leaf;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is not only guarded from the Injuries of any contingent Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
but also from the more piercing assaults of the Cold; so
long, till in time 'tis grown larger, and more hardy. The maner
and uses of the position of every <hi>Germen,</hi> considered as after it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a <hi>Branch;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hist. of the <hi>Prop.</hi> of <hi>Veget.</hi>
                     </note> hath already been, by the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Sharrock</hi>
very well observed; to whom I refer.</p>
                  <p>7. §. UPON THE prolongation of the <hi>Germen</hi> into a <hi>Branch,</hi> its
<hi>Leaves</hi> are thus display'd. The <hi>Parts</hi> whereof are substantially the
same with those of a <hi>Branch.</hi> For the <hi>Skin</hi> of the <hi>Leaf,</hi> is only the
ampliation of that of the <hi>Branch;</hi> being partly by the accretion of
new, and partly the extention of its already existent parts, dilated
(as in making of <hi>Leaf-Gold)</hi> into its present breadth. The <hi>Fibres</hi> or
<hi>Nerves</hi> dispersed through the <hi>Leaf,</hi> are only the Ramifications of the
<hi>Branch's</hi> Wood, or <hi>Lignous Body.</hi> The <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Leaf,</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100350:43"/>
which lies betwixt the <hi>Nerves,</hi> and as in Gentlewomens Needle-works,
fills all up, is nothing else, but the continuation of the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi>
or <hi>Parenchymous</hi> part of the <hi>Barque</hi> from the <hi>Branch</hi> into it self, as in
most <hi>Plants</hi> with a thick <hi>Leaf,</hi> may easily be seen.</p>
                  <p>8. §. The <hi>Fibers</hi> of the <hi>Leaf</hi> neither shoot out of the <hi>Branch,</hi> or
the <hi>Trunk,</hi> nor stand in the <hi>Stalk,</hi> in an <hi>even</hi> Line; but alwayes in
either an <hi>Angular</hi> or <hi>Circular</hi> posture; and usually making either a
<hi>Triangle,</hi> or a <hi>Semi-Circle,</hi> or <hi>Chord</hi> of a Circle; as in <hi>Cichory, Endive,
Cabbage,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 4. f. 2. <hi>to</hi> f. 11.</note> &amp;c. may be observed. And if the <hi>Leaf</hi> have but one main <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
that also is postur'd in a bowed or <hi>Lunar</hi> Figure; as in <hi>Mint</hi> and
others. The usual number of these <hi>Vascular Threds</hi> or <hi>Fibres</hi> is 3, 5, or 7.</p>
                  <p>9. §. The reason of the said Positions of the <hi>Fibers</hi> in the <hi>Stalk</hi> of
the <hi>Leaf,</hi> is for its more <hi>Erect</hi> growth, and greater <hi>Strength:</hi> which,
were the position of the said <hi>Fibers</hi> in an <hi>even Line,</hi> and so the <hi>Stalk</hi>
it self, as well as the <hi>Leaf,</hi> flat; must needs have been defective; as
from what we have said of the Circumferential posture of the <hi>Lignous
Body</hi> in the <hi>Trunk,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">C. 3. §. 24.</note> we may better conceive.</p>
                  <p>10. §. As likewise for the security of its <hi>Sap:</hi> For by this means
it is, that the several <hi>Fibers,</hi> and especially the main or middle <hi>Fiber</hi>
of the <hi>Leaf,</hi> together with a considerable part of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> are
so disposed of, as to jut out, not from its upper, but its back, or
neither Side. Whence the whole <hi>Leaf,</hi> reclining backward, becomes
a Canopy to them, defending them from those Injuries which from
colder Blasts, or an hotter Sun, they might otherwise sustain. So
that by a mutual benefit, as These give <hi>suck</hi> to all the <hi>Leaf,</hi> so that
again <hi>protection</hi> to These.</p>
                  <p>11. §. These <hi>Fibers</hi> are likewise the immediate Visible Cause of the
Shape of the <hi>Leaf.</hi> For if the nethermost <hi>Fiber</hi> or <hi>Fibers</hi> in the <hi>Stalk</hi>
(which thence runs chiefly through the length of the <hi>Leaf)</hi> be in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
greater, the <hi>Leaf</hi> is long; as in <hi>Endive, Cichory,</hi> and others:
If all of a more equal size, it spreads rounder, as in <hi>Ivy, Doves-foot,
Colts foot,</hi> &amp;c. And although a <hi>Dock-Leaf</hi> be very long, whose
<hi>Fibers</hi> notwithstanding, as they stand higher in the <hi>Stalk,</hi> are disposed
into a <hi>Circle</hi> all of an equal size; yet herein one or more peculiar
<hi>Fibres,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 4.</note> standing, in or near the <hi>Center,</hi> betwixt the rest, and running
through the length of the <hi>Leaf,</hi> may be observed.</p>
                  <p>12. §. In correspondence also to the size and shape of these <hi>Fibres,</hi>
is the <hi>Leaf</hi> flat. In that either they are very small, or if larger, yet
they never make an entire Circle or <hi>Ring;</hi> but either half of one, as
in <hi>Borage,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 4.</note> or at most three parts of one, as in <hi>Mullen,</hi> may be seen.
For if either they were so big, as to contain, or so entire, as perfectly
to include a <hi>Pith,</hi> the Energy of the <hi>Sap</hi> in that <hi>Pith,</hi> would cause
the said <hi>Lignous Ring</hi> to shoot forth on every side, as it doth in the
<hi>Root</hi> or <hi>Trunk:</hi> But the said <hi>Fibers</hi> being not figur'd into an entire
<hi>Ring,</hi> but so as to be open; on that hand therefore where open
they cannot shoot any thing directly from themselves, because there
they have nothing to shoot; and the <hi>Sap</hi> having also a free vent
through the said opening, against that part therefore which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
oppsite, it can have no force; and so neither will they shoot
forth on that hand; and so will they consequently, that way only,
which the force of the <hi>Sap</hi> directs, which is only on the right and
left.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:100350:43"/>
13. §. The several <hi>Fibers</hi> in the <hi>Stalk,</hi> are all Inosculated in the
<hi>Leaf,</hi> with very many Sub-divisions. According as these <hi>Fibers</hi> are
Inosculated near, or at, or shoot directly to the edge of the <hi>Leaf,</hi>
is it Even, or Scallop'd. Where these <hi>Inosculations</hi> are not made,
there we have no <hi>Leaves,</hi> but only a company of <hi>Filaments;</hi> as in
<hi>Fennel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. §. To the <hi>Formations</hi> of <hi>Leaves,</hi> the <hi>Fouldings</hi> immediately
follow. And sometimes they have one Date, or are the contemporary
works of <hi>Nature;</hi> each <hi>Leaf</hi> obtaining its distinct shape, and proper
posture together; both being perfect, not only in the outer, but Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
and minutest <hi>Leaves,</hi> which are five hundred times smaller than the
outer: both which in the Cautious opening of a <hi>Germen</hi> may be seen.</p>
                  <p>15. §. Nor is there greater Art in the <hi>Forms,</hi> than in the <hi>Foulds</hi>
or <hi>Postures</hi> of <hi>Leaves;</hi> both answerably varying, as this or that way
they may be most agreeable.<note place="margin">Treat. of the <hi>Quincunx.</hi>
                     </note> Of the <hi>Quincuncial</hi> posture, so amply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanc'd
in by the Learned Sir <hi>Thomas Brown,</hi> I shall omit to speak.
Others there are, which though not all so universal, yet equally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
where they are, giving two general advantages to the <hi>Leaves,
Elegancy</hi> and <hi>Security, sc.</hi> in taking up, so as their <hi>Forms</hi> will bear,
the least room; and in being so conveniently couch'd, as to be capable
of receiving protection from other Parts, or of giving it one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
as for instance,</p>
                  <p>16. §. First, There is the <hi>Bow-Lap,</hi> where the <hi>Leaves</hi> are all
laid somewhat convexly one over another, but not plaited; being to
the length, breadth and number of <hi>Leaves</hi> most agreeable; as in the
Buds of <hi>Pear-tree, Plum-tree,</hi> &amp;c. But where the <hi>Leaves</hi> are not so
thick set, as to stand in the <hi>Bow-Lap,</hi> there we have the <hi>Plicature,</hi> or
the <hi>Flat-Lap;</hi> as in <hi>Rose-Tree, Strawberry, Cinquefoyl, Burnet,</hi> &amp;c. For
the <hi>Leaves</hi> being here plaited, and so lying in half their breadth, and
divers of them thus also collaterally set together; the thickness of
them all, and half their breadth, are much alike dimensions; by which
they stand more secure within themselves, and in better consort with
other <hi>Germen-Growths</hi> in the same <hi>Truss.</hi> If the <hi>Leaves</hi> be much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented
or jagg'd, now we have the <hi>Duplicature;</hi> wherein there
are divers <hi>Plaits</hi> in one <hi>Leaf,</hi> or <hi>Labels</hi> of a <hi>Leaf,</hi> but in distinct
<hi>Sets,</hi> a lesser under a greater; as in <hi>Souchus, Tansey,</hi> &amp;c. When
the <hi>Leaves</hi> stand not collaterally, but single; and are moreover
very broad; then we have the <hi>Multiplicature;</hi> as in <hi>Gooseberries, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</hi>
&amp;c. the <hi>Plaits</hi> being not only divers in the same <hi>Leaf,</hi> but of
the same <hi>Set</hi> continuant, and so each <hi>Leaf</hi> gather'd up in five, seven
or more <hi>Foulds,</hi> in the same manner as our Gentlewomens Fans.
Where either the thickness of the <hi>Leaf</hi> will not permit a <hi>Flat-Lap,</hi> or
the fewness of their number, or the smalness of their <hi>Fibers,</hi> will allow
the <hi>Rowl,</hi> there This may be observed. Which is sometimes single, as in
<hi>Bears-Ears, Arum, Flammula, Jerusalem Cowslip,</hi> &amp;c. Sometimes dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the two <hi>Rowls</hi> beginning at each edge of the <hi>Leaf,</hi> and meeting
in the middle. Which again, is either the <hi>Fore-Rowl,</hi> or the <hi>Back-Rowl.</hi>
If the <hi>Leaf</hi> be design'd to grow long, now we have the <hi>Back-Rowl,</hi>
as in <hi>Docks, Sorrels,</hi> and the rest of this Kindred: as also in
<hi>Primrose,</hi> and other like <hi>Plants.</hi> For the main <hi>Fibers,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
a considerable part of the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> standing prominent from
the <hi>Back-side</hi> of the <hi>Leaf,</hi> they thus stand securely couch'd up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100350:44"/>
the two <hi>Rowls;</hi> on whose security the growth of the <hi>Leaf</hi>
in length depends. But those of <hi>Bears-Ears, Violets, Doves Foot,
Warden,</hi> and many more, upon contrary respects, are rowled up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
Lastly, there is the <hi>Tre-Rowl,</hi> as in <hi>Fern;</hi> the <hi>Labels</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
though all rowled up to the <hi>main Stem,</hi> yet could not stand so
firm and secure from the Injuries either of the <hi>Ground</hi> or <hi>Weather,</hi> unless
to the <hi>Rowls</hi> in breadth, that by the length were super-induc'd;
the <hi>Stalk</hi> or <hi>main Stem</hi> giving the same Protection here, which in
other <hi>Plants</hi> by the <hi>Leaves,</hi> or some particular <hi>Mantling,</hi> is contriv'd.
These, and other <hi>Foulds,</hi> See in the <hi>Figures</hi> belonging to the <hi>First
<hi>Part</hi>
                     </hi> of the <hi>Fourth <hi>Book.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. §. According to the <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Foulding</hi> of every <hi>Leaf</hi> or
<hi>Germen,</hi> is its Protection order'd; about six ways whereof may be observ'd; <hi>sc.</hi> by <hi>Leaves, Surfoyls, Interfoyls, Stalks, Hoods</hi> and <hi>Mant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi>
To add to what we have above given, one or two Instances.
Every <hi>Bud,</hi> besides its proper <hi>Leaves,</hi> is covered with divers Leafy
<hi>Pannicles</hi> or <hi>Surfoyls;</hi> which, what the <hi>Leaves</hi> are to one another,
are that to them all: For not opening except gradually, they admit
not the <hi>Weather, Wet, Sun</hi> or <hi>Aer,</hi> to approach the <hi>Leaves,</hi> except by
degrees respondent, and as they are gradually inur'd to bear them.
Sometimes, besides <hi>Surfoyls,</hi> there are also many <hi>Interfoyls</hi> set betwixt
the <hi>Leaves,</hi> from the Circumference to the Center of the <hi>Bud;</hi> as in
the <hi>Hasel.</hi> For the <hi>Fibres</hi> of these <hi>Leaves</hi> standing out so far from a
plain surface; they would, if not thus shelter'd, lie too much expos'd
and naked to the <hi>Severities</hi> of the <hi>Weather.</hi> Where none of all the
Protections above-named, are convenient, there the <hi>Membranes</hi> of the
<hi>Leaves</hi> by continuation in their first forming (together with some <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi>
of the <hi>Lignous Body)</hi> are drawn out into so many <hi>Mantles</hi> or
<hi>Veils;</hi> as in <hi>Docks, Snakeweed,</hi> &amp;c. For the <hi>Leaves</hi> here being but
few, yet each <hi>Leaf</hi> and its <hi>Stalk</hi> being both exceeding long; at the
bottom whereof the next following <hi>Leaf</hi> still springs up; the form
and posture of all is such, as supersedes all the other kinds of Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and so each <hi>Leaf</hi> apart is provided with a <hi>Veil</hi> to it self. These,
and other <hi>Protections,</hi> See in the <hi>Figures</hi> belonging to the <hi>First <hi>Part</hi>
                     </hi>
of the <hi>Fourth <hi>Book.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. § The Uses of the <hi>Leaves,</hi> I mean in respect of their service
to the <hi>Plant</hi> it self, are these: First, for Protection; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
what they give one to another, they afford also to the <hi>Flower</hi>
and <hi>Fruit.</hi> To the <hi>Flower</hi> in their <hi>Foulds;</hi> that being, for the most
part, born and usher'd into the open Aer by the <hi>Leaves.</hi> To the
<hi>Fruit,</hi> when afterwards they are display'd, as in <hi>Strawberries, Grapes,
Rasps, Mulberries,</hi> &amp;c. On which, and the like, should the Sun-Beams
immediately strike, especially while they are young, they
would quite shrivel them up; but being by the <hi>Leaves</hi> screened off,
they impress the circumjacent <hi>Aer</hi> so far only as gently to warm the
said <hi>Fruits,</hi> and so to promote their <hi>Fermentation</hi> and <hi>Growth.</hi> And
accordingly we see, that the <hi>Leaves</hi> above-named are exceeding large
in propotion to the <hi>Fruits:</hi> whereas in <hi>Pear-trees, Apple-trees,</hi> &amp;c.
the <hi>Fruit</hi> being of a solider <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> and so not needing the like
protection, are usually equal with, and often wider in Diameter than
the <hi>Leaves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

19. §. Another use is for Augmentation; or, the capacity for
the due spreading and ampliation of a <hi>Tree</hi> or other <hi>Plant,</hi> are its,
<hi>Leaves.</hi> For herein the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> being divided into small <hi>Fibres,</hi>
and these running all along their lax and spongie <hi>Parenchyma;</hi> they
are thus a <hi>Body</hi> sit for the imbibition of <hi>Sap,</hi> and easie <hi>Growth.</hi> Now
the <hi>Sap</hi> having a free reception into the <hi>Leaves,</hi> it still gives way to
the next succeeding in the <hi>Branches</hi> and <hi>Trunk,</hi> and the voyding
of the <hi>Sap</hi> in these, for the mounting of that in the <hi>Root,</hi> and ingress
of that in the <hi>Ground.</hi> But were there no <hi>Leaves</hi> to make a free
reception of <hi>Sap,</hi> it must be needs be stagnant in all the <hi>Parts</hi> to the
<hi>Root,</hi> and so the <hi>Root</hi> being clogg'd, its fermenting and other Offices
will be voyded, and so the due <hi>Growth</hi> of the whole. As in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a <hi>Watch,</hi> although the original term thereof be the <hi>Spring,</hi> yet
the capacity for its continuance in a due measure throughout all the
<hi>Wheels,</hi> is the free and easie motion of the <hi>Ballance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. §. Lastly, As the <hi>Leaves</hi> subserve the more copious advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
so the higher purity of the <hi>Sap.</hi> For this being well fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
both in the <hi>Root,</hi> and in its Ascent through the <hi>Trunk,</hi> and
so its <hi>Parts</hi> prepar'd to a farther separation; the grosser ones are
still deposited into the <hi>Leaves;</hi> the more elaborate and essential only
thus supplied to the <hi>Flower, Fruit</hi> and <hi>Seed,</hi> as their convenient <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Whence it is, that where the <hi>Flowers</hi> are many and large, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which the more odorous <hi>Particles</hi> are copiously receiv'd, the green
<hi>Leaves</hi> have little or no smell; as those of <hi>Rose-tree, Carnations, French-Marigold,
Wood-bind, Tulips,</hi> &amp;c. But on the contrary, where the
<hi>Flowers</hi> are none, or small, the green <hi>Leaves</hi> themselve are likewise of
a strong savour; as those of <hi>Wormwood, Tansie, Baum, Mint, Rue,
Geranium Moschatum, Angelica,</hi> and others.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>THorns</hi> are of two kinds, <hi>Lignous</hi> and <hi>Cortical.</hi> Of the first are
such as those of the <hi>Hawthorn,</hi> and are constituted of all the

                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. Upon the <hi>Leaves</hi> of divers <hi>Plants</hi> two <hi>Productions</hi> shew
themselves, <hi>sc. Hairs</hi> and <hi>Gloubulets.</hi> Of <hi>Hairs,</hi> only one kind is
taken notice of; although they are various. Ordinarily they are of
a <hi>Simple Figure;</hi> which when fine and thick set, as on most <hi>Hairy
Buds;</hi> or fine and long, as on those of the <hi>Vine,</hi> we call them <hi>Down.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. But sometimes they are <hi>Branched out,</hi> from the bottom to the
top, reciprocally on every side, in some resemblance to a <hi>Stags Horn;</hi>
as in <hi>Mullen.</hi> And sometimes they are <hi>Astral,</hi> as upon <hi>Lavender,</hi> and
some other <hi>Leaves,</hi> and especially those of <hi>Wild Olive;</hi> wherein every
<hi>Hair</hi> rising in one round entire <hi>Basis</hi> a little way above the surface of
the <hi>Leaf,</hi> is then disparted, Star-like, into several, four, five or six
<hi>Points,</hi> all standing at right Angles with the said perpendicular <hi>Basis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. The Uses of <hi>Hairs</hi> are for <hi>Distinction</hi> and <hi>Protection.</hi> That
of <hi>Distinction</hi> is but secondary, the <hi>Leaves</hi> being grown to a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
size. That of <hi>Protection</hi> is the prime, for which they were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
form'd together with the <hi>Leaves</hi> themselves, and whose ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
they enjoy in their Infant-estate: For the <hi>Hairs</hi> being then in form
of a <hi>Down,</hi> always very thick set, thus give that <hi>Protection</hi> to the
<hi>Leaves,</hi> which their exceeding tenderness then requires; so that they
seem to be vested with a Coat of <hi>Frize,</hi> or to be kept warm, like
young and dainty <hi>Chickens,</hi> in <hi>Wool.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. <hi>Globulets</hi> are seen upon <hi>Orach,</hi> both Garden and Wild;
and yet more plainly on <hi>Mercury</hi> or <hi>Bonus Henricus.</hi> In these, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
almost upon the whole <hi>Plant,</hi> and being very large, they are by
all taken notice of.</p>
                     <p>8.§. But strict Observation discovers, that these <hi>Globulets</hi> are
the natural and constant Off-spring of very many other <hi>Plants.</hi> Both
these <hi>Globulets,</hi> and likewise the diversity of <hi>Hairs,</hi> I find that Mr.
<hi>Hook</hi> hath also observed.<note place="margin">Micrography.</note> I take notice, that they are of two kinds;
<hi>Transparent,</hi> as upon the <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Hysop, Mint, Baume,</hi> and many more
<hi>White,</hi> as upon those of <hi>Germander, Sage,</hi> and others. All which,
though the naked Eye will discover, yet by the help of <hi>Glasses</hi> we
may observe them most distinctly. The use of these we suppose the
same, in part, with those of the <hi>Flower,</hi> whereof we shall speak.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E next proceed to the <hi>Flower.</hi> The general <hi>Parts</hi>
whereof are most commonly three; <hi>sc.</hi> the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palement,</hi>
the <hi>Foliation,</hi> and the <hi>Attire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. §. The <hi>Empalement,</hi> whether of one or more
pieces, I call that which is the utmost <hi>Part</hi> of the
<hi>Flower,</hi> encompassing the other two. 'Tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of the three general <hi>Parts,</hi> the <hi>Skin,</hi> the
<hi>Cortical</hi> and <hi>Lignous Bodies,</hi> each <hi>Empaler</hi> (where there are divers)
being as another little <hi>Leaf;</hi> as in those of a <hi>Quince-Flower,</hi> as oft
as they happen to be overgrown, is well seen. As likewise in the
<hi>Primrose,</hi> with the <hi>green Flower;</hi> commonly so call'd, though by a
mistake: For that which seems to be the <hi>Flower,</hi> is only the more
flourishing <hi>Empalement,</hi> the <hi>Flower</hi> it self being <hi>White.</hi> But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of all the three aforesaid <hi>Parts</hi> into each <hi>Empaler,</hi> is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable,
I think, no where better than in an <hi>Artichoke,</hi> which is a
true <hi>Flower,</hi> and whose <hi>Empalers</hi> are of that amplitude, as fairly to
shew them all: As also, that the Original of the <hi>Skin</hi> of each <hi>Empaler</hi>
or <hi>Leaf</hi> is not distinct from that of the rest; but to be all one piece,
laid in so many <hi>Plaits</hi> or <hi>Duplicatures,</hi> as there are <hi>Leaves,</hi> from the
outermost to the inner and most Central ones.</p>
                  <p>3. §. The Design of the <hi>Empalement,</hi> is to be <hi>Security</hi> and <hi>Bands</hi>
to the other two <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Flower:</hi> To be their <hi>Security</hi> before its
opening, by intercepting all extremities of <hi>Weather:</hi> Afterwards to be
their <hi>Bands,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irmly to contain all their <hi>Parts</hi> in their due and
most decorous posture: so that a <hi>Flower</hi> without its <hi>Empalement,</hi>
would hang as uncouth and taudry, as a <hi>Lady</hi> without her <hi>Bodies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. §. Hence we have the reason why it is various, and sometimes
wanting. Some <hi>Flowers</hi> have none, as <hi>Tulips;</hi> for having a fat and
frim <hi>Leaf,</hi> and each <hi>Leaf</hi> likewise standing on a broad and strong <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
they are thus sufficient to themselves. <hi>Carnations,</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
have not only an <hi>Empalement,</hi> but that (for more firmitude)
of one piece: For otherwise, the Foot of each <hi>Leaf</hi> being very long
and slender, most of them would be apt to break out of compass:
yet is the top of the <hi>Empalement</hi> indented also; that the <hi>Indentments,</hi>
by being lapp'd over the <hi>Leaves</hi> before their expansion, may then
protect them; and by being spread under them afterwards, may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shoulder and prop them up. And if the Feet of the <hi>Leaves</hi> be
both long and very tender too, here the <hi>Empalement</hi> is numerous,
though consisting of several pieces; yet those in divers <hi>Rounds,</hi> and
all with a counterchangeable respect to each other (which also the
Learned Sir <hi>Thomas Brown</hi> observes) as in all <hi>Knapweeds,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Treat. of the <hi>Quincunx.</hi>
                     </note> and other
<hi>Flowers;</hi> whereby, how commodious they are for both the aforesaid
ends, may easily be conceiv'd; and well enough exemplified by the
Scales of <hi>Fishes,</hi> whereunto, as to their position, they have not an
unapt resemblance.</p>

                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:100350:46"/>
5. §. THE FOLIATION also, is of the same substantial <hi>Nature</hi>
with the green <hi>Leaf;</hi> the <hi>Membrane, Pulp,</hi> and <hi>Fibres</hi> whereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as there, so here, but the continuation of the <hi>Skin,</hi> the <hi>Cortical</hi>
and <hi>Lignous Bodies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. §. The <hi>Foulds</hi> of the <hi>Flower</hi> or <hi>Foliation</hi> are various, as those
of the green <hi>Leaf;</hi> but some of them different. The most general
are, First, The <hi>Close-Couch,</hi> as in <hi>Roses,</hi> and many other double <hi>Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi>
Then the <hi>Concave-Couch,</hi> as in <hi>Blattaria flore albo.</hi> Next the
<hi>Plait,</hi> as in some of the <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Pease-Blooms,</hi> in the <hi>Flowers</hi> of <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
&amp;c. which is either single, as in those nam'd; or double, as in
<hi>Blew-Bottle, Jacea,</hi> and more of that rank. Next, the <hi>Couch,</hi> and
<hi>Plait</hi> together in the same <hi>Flower,</hi> as in <hi>Marigolds, Daisies,</hi> and all
others of an agreeing form: where the first apparent <hi>Fould</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture</hi>
of the <hi>Leaves</hi> is in <hi>Couch;</hi> but the <hi>Leaves</hi> being erect, each
likewise may be seen to lie in a double <hi>Plait</hi> within it self. Then
the <hi>Rowl,</hi> as in the <hi>Flowers</hi> of <hi>Ladies-Bower,</hi> the broad top of each
<hi>Leaf</hi> being by a double <hi>Rowl</hi> foulded up inwardly. Next, the <hi>Spire,</hi>
which is the beginning of a <hi>Rowl;</hi> and may be seen in the <hi>Flowers</hi>
of <hi>Mallows,</hi> and others. Lastly, the <hi>Plait</hi> and <hi>Spire</hi> together, where
the <hi>Part</hi> analogous to the <hi>Foliation,</hi> is of one piece, the <hi>Plaits</hi> being
here laid, and so carried on by <hi>Spiral Lines</hi> to the top of the <hi>Flower,</hi>
as is in divers, and I think, in <hi>Convolvulus Doronici folio,</hi> more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
seen. These and other <hi>Foulds,</hi> See in the <hi>Figures</hi> belonging
to the <hi>Second Part</hi> of the <hi>Fourth Book.</hi> The reason of all which
varieties, a comparative consideration of the several <hi>Parts</hi> of the
<hi>Flower</hi> may suggest. I'le only mention, That no <hi>Flower,</hi> that I find,
hath a <hi>Back-Rowl,</hi> as hath the green <hi>Leaf.</hi> For two Reasons; because
its <hi>Leaves</hi> have not their <hi>Fibres</hi> standing out much on their backside,
as the green <hi>Leaves</hi> have; and because of its <hi>Attire,</hi> which it ever em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosomes,
and cannot so well do it by a <hi>Back-Rowl.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. §. The usual <hi>Protections</hi> of <hi>Flowers</hi> by the Precedents are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd,
<hi>sc. Green Leaves</hi> and <hi>Empalements.</hi> Some have another more
peculiar, that is a <hi>double Veil;</hi> as the <hi>Spring-Crocus.</hi> For having no
<hi>Empalement,</hi> and starting up early out of the <hi>Mould,</hi> even before its <hi>Green
Leaves,</hi> and that upon the first opening of the Spring; lest it should
thus be quite starved, 'tis born swath'd up in a double <hi>Blanket,</hi> or
with a pair of <hi>Sheets</hi> upon its <hi>Back.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. §. The <hi>Leaves</hi> of divers <hi>Flowers</hi> at their <hi>Basis</hi> have an <hi>hairy
Tuft;</hi> by which <hi>Tufts</hi> the Concave of the <hi>Empalement</hi> is filled up;
That, being very choice and tender, they may thus be kept in a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and constant Warmth, as most convenient for them.</p>
                  <p>9. §. The <hi>Leaves</hi> of the <hi>Flower,</hi> though they are not hairy all
over, yet in some particular parts they are often set with a fine
Downy <hi>Velvet;</hi> that, being by their shape and posture in those
parts contiguous to their delicate and tender <hi>Attire,</hi> they may thus
give it a more soft and warmer touch. Thus in the <hi>Flower</hi> of <hi>Ladies
Bower,</hi> those parts of its <hi>Leaves</hi> which rowl inward, and lie contiguous
to the <hi>Attire,</hi> are Downy; whereas the other <hi>Parts</hi> are smooth or
bald: So the <hi>Flowers</hi> of <hi>Pease, Spanish Broom, Toad-Flax,</hi> and many
others, where contiguous to their <hi>Attires,</hi> are deck'd with the like
<hi>Hairy Velvet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:100350:46"/>
10. §. As upon the Green <hi>Leaves,</hi> so upon the <hi>Flowers</hi> are
<hi>Globulets</hi> somtimes seen; as upon the backside of that of <hi>Enula.</hi> On
none more plainly than that kind of <hi>Blattaria</hi> with the white <hi>Flower;</hi>
where they are all transparent, and growing both on the <hi>Stalk</hi> and
<hi>Leaves</hi> of the <hi>Flower,</hi> each shewing likewise its <hi>Peduncle</hi> whereon it
is erected.</p>
                  <p>11. §. The use of the <hi>Flower,</hi> or the <hi>Foliation</hi> whereof we now
speak, (that is, as to its private service) is for the protection of
the <hi>Attire; This,</hi> as its under, and the <hi>Empalement</hi> as its upper Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
As likewise of the <hi>Fruit:</hi> The necessity of which Service, in
some Cases, by the different situation of the <hi>Flower</hi> and <hi>Fruit,</hi> with
respect to each other, is evident; <hi>Apples, Pears,</hi> and several other
<hi>Fruits,</hi> standing behind or under the <hi>Flower;</hi> but <hi>Cherries, Aprecots,</hi>
and divers others, within it. For these<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being of a very tender and
pulpous Body, and withal putting forth with the colder part of the
Spring; could not weather it out against the Variations and Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of the Air, (as those of a more solid <hi>Parenchyma</hi> can) except
lodged up within their <hi>Flowers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. §. And as the <hi>Flower</hi> is serviceable to the safety of the
<hi>Fruit,</hi> so is it to its growth; <hi>sc.</hi> in its Infancy, or <hi>Embryo</hi>-estate;
for which purpose, as there is a <hi>Flower,</hi> so that <hi>Flower</hi> is greater or
less, according as the nature of the <hi>Fruit</hi> to which it belongs, and
the plenty of the <hi>Sap</hi> by which the <hi>Fruit</hi> is fed, doth require.
Thus, where the young <hi>Fruit</hi> is of a solider Substance and the ascent
of the <hi>Sap</hi> less copious, were there here no <hi>Flower</hi> to promote the
said ascent thereof into the <hi>Fruit</hi> (in the manner as is effected by the
Green <hi>Leaves)</hi> it must needs pine and die, or prove less kindly. On
the contrary, should the <hi>Flower</hi> be over-large, it would not only
promote the ascent of the <hi>Sap</hi> up to the <hi>Fruit,</hi> but being as yet over-proportionate
to it, would likewise it self exhaust the same <hi>Sap,</hi> as
fast as ascendent; like a greedy Nurse, that prepares the Meat for her
Child, and then eats it up her self. Thus we see <hi>Apples</hi> and <hi>Pears,</hi>
with a <hi>Flower</hi> of a moderate <hi>Size;</hi> like their <hi>Body,</hi> of a middle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
and their <hi>Sap,</hi> of a middle quantity: But <hi>Quinces,</hi> being
more solid, besides that they have as great a <hi>Flower,</hi> the <hi>Imqalers</hi> of
their <hi>Flower</hi> also thrive so far as to become handsom <hi>Leaves;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
also after the <hi>Flower</hi> is fallen, firm and verdent a great while;
so long, till the <hi>Fruit</hi> be able to provide for it self. On the other
hand, <hi>Plums</hi> being more tender and Sappy than <hi>Appels</hi> and <hi>Pears,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that their <hi>Empalers</hi> are much alike, their <hi>Flower</hi> is less. and <hi>Goos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries</hi>
and <hi>Currans,</hi> which are still more Pulpy, and the course of the
<hi>Sap</hi> towards them more free, have yet a <hi>Flower</hi> far less. And <hi>Grapes,</hi>
whose <hi>Sap</hi> is still of quicker Ascent, have scarce any <hi>Flower</hi> at all;
only some small resemblance thereof, serving just upon the setting of
the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and no longer.</p>
                  <p>13. §. THE ATTIRE, I find to be of two kinds, <hi>Seminiforme,</hi>
and <hi>Florid.</hi> That which I call <hi>Seminiforme,</hi> is made up of two general
<hi>Parts, Chives</hi> and <hi>Semets,</hi> one upon each <hi>Chive.</hi> These <hi>Semets</hi> (as I
take leave to call them) have the appearance, especially in many
<hi>Flowers,</hi> of so many little <hi>Seeds:</hi> but are quite another kind of <hi>Body.</hi>
For, upon enquiry, we find, that these <hi>Semets,</hi> though they seem to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100350:47"/>
be solid, and for some time after their first formation, are entire; yet
are they really hollow; and their side, or sides, which were at first
entire, at length crack asunder: And that moreover the <hi>Concave</hi> of
each <hi>Semet</hi> is not a meer vacuity, but fill'd up with a number of minute
Particles, in form of a <hi>Powder.</hi> Which, though common to all <hi>Semets,</hi>
yet in some, and particularly those of a <hi>Tulip</hi> or a <hi>Lilly,</hi> being larger,
is more distinctly observable.<note place="margin">Tab. 4. f. 12.</note>

                  <p>15. §. The Particles of these <hi>Powders,</hi> though like those of
Meal or other Dust, they appear not easily to have any relugar shape;
yet upon strict observation, especially with the assistance of an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fferent
<hi>Glass,</hi> it doth appear, That they are a <hi>Congeries,</hi> usually, of
so many perfect <hi>Globes</hi> or <hi>Globulets;</hi> Sometimes of other <hi>Figures,</hi> but

are extreamly so. In <hi>Mallows,</hi> and some others, more fairly visible.</p>

rude Name of <hi>Thrums;</hi> as in the <hi>Flowers</hi> of <hi>Marigold, Tansie,</hi> &amp;c.
How in adequate its imposition is, observation will determine. For the
several <hi>Thrums</hi> or rather <hi>Suits,</hi> whereof the <hi>Attire</hi> is made up, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
else they may differ in various <hi>Flowers,</hi> in this agree, that they

                  <p>18. §. The <hi>outer Part</hi> of every <hi>Suit,</hi> is its <hi>Floret:</hi> whose <hi>Body</hi>
or <hi>Tube</hi> is divided at the top (like that of the <hi>Cowslip)</hi> into five
distinct <hi>Leaves.</hi> So that a <hi>Floret,</hi> is the Epitome of a <hi>Flower:</hi> and
is all the <hi>Flower</hi> that many <hi>Plants,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">f. 13. b.</note> as <hi>Mugwort, Tansie,</hi> and others,

                  </p>
                  <p>19. §. Upon the Expansion of the <hi>Floret;</hi> the next <hi>Part</hi> of the
<hi>Suit</hi> is from within its <hi>Tube</hi> brought to sight; which we may (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

the other two, but solid; yet at its Point, is commonly, divided into

                  <p>21. §. About the said Point especially, there appears, <hi>Globulets,</hi>
which are of the same nature with those of a <hi>Semet,</hi> though not so
copious. So that all <hi>Flowers</hi> have their <hi>Powders</hi> or <hi>Globulets.</hi> The

See in <hi>Tab.</hi> 4. But especially in the <hi>Figures</hi> belonging to the <hi>Second
Part</hi> of the <hi>Fourth Book.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>22. §. The use of the <hi>Attire,</hi> how contemptibly soever we may
look upon it, is certainly great. And though for our own use we
value the <hi>Leaves</hi> of the <hi>Flower,</hi> or the <hi>Foliation,</hi> most; yet of all
the three <hi>Parts,</hi> this is some respects is the choycest, as for whose
sake and service the other two are made. The use hereof, as to
<hi>Ornament</hi> and <hi>Distinction,</hi> is unquestionable; but is not all. As for
Distinction, though, by the help of <hi>Glasses,</hi> we may make it to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
far; yet in a passant view, which is all we usually make, we
cannot so well. As for Ornament, and particularly in reference to the
<hi>Semets,</hi> we may ask, If for that meerly these were meant, then why
should they be so made as to break open, or to contain any thing
within them? Since their Beauty would be as good if they were not
hollow; and is better before they crack and burst open, than after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>23. §. Other uses hereof therefore we must acknowledge, and
may observe. One is, for food; for Ornament and Distinction to
us, and for <hi>Food</hi> to other <hi>Animals.</hi> I will not say, but that it may serve
even to these for Distinction too, that they may be able to know one
<hi>Plant</hi> from another, and in their flight or progress settle where they
like best: and that therefore the varieties of these small parts are many,
and well observed by them, which we take no notice of. Yet the
finding out of Food is but in order to enjoy it: Which, that it is
provided for a vast number of little <hi>Animals</hi> in the <hi>Attires</hi> of all
<hi>Flowers,</hi> observation perswades us to believe. For why else are they
evermore here found? Go from one <hi>Flower</hi> to another, great and
small, you shall meet with none untaken up with these Guests. In
some, and particularly the <hi>Sun-Flower,</hi> where the parts of the <hi>Attire,</hi>
and the <hi>Animals</hi> for which they provide, are larger, the matter is more
visible. We must not think, that <hi>God Almighty</hi> hath left any of the
whole Family of his Creatures unprovided for; but as the Great
Master, some where or other carveth out to all; and that for a
great number of these little Folk, He hath stored up their peculiar
provisions in the <hi>Attires</hi> of <hi>Flowers;</hi> each <hi>Flower</hi> thus becoming their
Lodging and their Dining-Room, both in one.</p>
                  <p>24. §. Wherein the particular parts of the <hi>Attire</hi> may be more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly
serviceable, this to one <hi>Animal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and that to another, I cannot
say: Or to the same <hi>Animal,</hi> as a <hi>Bee,</hi> whether this for the <hi>Honey,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for their <hi>Bread,</hi> a third for the <hi>Wax:</hi> Or whether all only suck

from hence some <hi>Juice;</hi> or some may not also carry some of the <hi>Parts,</hi>
as of the <hi>Globulets,</hi> wholly away.</p>
                  <p>25. §. Or lastly, what may be the Primary and Private Use of
the <hi>Attire</hi> (for even this abovesaid, though great, yet is but Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary)

that is, their <hi>Essential</hi> and truly <hi>Vital Parts,</hi>
are in all the same, and but the continuation
of those which in the other <hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi>
we have already observed. Yet because by
the different <hi>Constitutions</hi> and <hi>Tinctures</hi> of these
<hi>Parts,</hi> divers considerably different <hi>Fruits</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult;
I shall therefore take a particular view
of the more known and principal of them, <hi>sc.
Apples, Pears, Plums, Nuts</hi> and <hi>Berries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. §. AN APPLE, if cut traverse, appears constitued of four
distinct <hi>Parts,</hi> the <hi>Pilling,</hi> the <hi>Parenchyma, Branchery,</hi> and <hi>Coare.</hi> The
<hi>Pilling</hi> is only the spreading and dilatation of the <hi>Skin,</hi> or utmost
part of the <hi>Barque</hi> in the <hi>Branch.</hi> The <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> when full ripe,
is a tender delicate Meat. Yet as the <hi>Pilling</hi> is but the Continuation of
the utmost part of the <hi>Barque;</hi> so is this, but the continuance and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliation,
or (as I may call it) the swelth and superbience of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Part</hi> thereof; which upon observation of a young and Infant-<hi>Apple</hi>
especially, is evident. Thus we see the <hi>Pith,</hi> which is often tough;
in many <hi>Roots,</hi> as <hi>Parsneps, Turneps,</hi> &amp;c. is tender and edible. So
here, the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> though originally no more than the <hi>Barque,</hi>
yet the copiousness and purity of its <hi>Sap</hi> being likewise effectual to
the largness and fineness of its growth, it thus becomes a soft and tender
meat. The <hi>Branchery</hi> is nothing else but the Ramifications of the <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Body</hi> throughout all the parts of the <hi>Parenchyma;</hi> the greater
<hi>Branches</hi> being likewise by the <hi>Inosculations</hi> of the less (as in the <hi>Leaf)</hi>
united together. The main <hi>Branches</hi> are usually Twenty: Ten are
spred and distributed through the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> most of them enarch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves towards the <hi>Cork</hi> or <hi>Stool</hi> of the <hi>Flower:</hi> The other
Ten, running from the <hi>Stalk</hi> in a directer Line, at last meet the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
at the said <hi>Cork,</hi> and are there osculated with them. Of these
latter, five are originated from one; which running along the Center
of the <hi>Stalk,</hi> and part of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> is therein at
last divided. To these the Coats of the <hi>Kernels</hi> are fastned. So that
whereas most of these <hi>Branches</hi> were originally extended even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and inserted into the <hi>Flower</hi> for the due growth
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100350:48"/>
thereof; the <hi>Fruit</hi> afterwards growing to some head, and so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
and preying upon the <hi>Aliment</hi> of the <hi>Flower,</hi> starves that
and therefrom supersedes the service of the said <hi>Branches</hi> to it self,
fifteen for its <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> and five for its <hi>Seed.</hi> The <hi>Coar</hi> is origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the <hi>Pith;</hi> for the <hi>Sap</hi> finding room enough in the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi>
through which to dispence it self all abroad, quits the <hi>Pith,</hi> which
thereby hardens into a <hi>Coar.</hi> Thus we see the <hi>Insertions,</hi> although
originate from the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> yet their <hi>Parts</hi> being, by the <hi>Inos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations</hi>
of the <hi>Lignous,</hi> so much compress'd and made to co-incide
together, they become a <hi>Body</hi> very compact and dense. And in the
<hi>Barque</hi> the same thing is effected by <hi>Arefaction</hi> only, or a meer <hi>voydance</hi>
of the <hi>Sap;</hi> the <hi>Inner Part</hi> whereof, though soft and sappy, yet its super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
<hi>Rind</hi> is often so hard and smooth, that it may be fairly writ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Part</hi> of the <hi>Fourth Book.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. §. IN A PEAR there are five distinct <hi>Parts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 4. f. 14.</note> the <hi>Pilling,</hi> the
<hi>Parenchyma, Branchery, Calculary,</hi> and <hi>Acetary.</hi> The three former are
here and in an <hi>Apple</hi> much alike; saving that here the <hi>Inner</hi> or <hi>Seed-Branches</hi>
ordinarily stand double. The <hi>Calculary</hi> (most observable
in rough-tasted, or <hi>Choak-Pears)</hi> is a <hi>Congeries</hi> of little stony <hi>Knots.</hi>
They are many of them dispersed throughout the whole <hi>Parenchyma:</hi>
But lying more continuous and compact together towards the Center
of the <hi>Pear,</hi> surround the <hi>Acetary</hi> there, in a somewhat Globular Form.
About the <hi>Stalk</hi> they stand more distant; but towards the <hi>Cork</hi> or
<hi>Stool</hi> of the <hi>Flower,</hi> they still grow closer, and there at last gather
(almost) into the firmitude of a <hi>Plum-stone</hi> it self. Within this lies
the <hi>Acetary;</hi> 'tis allways sour, and by the bounding of the <hi>Calculary</hi>
of a <hi>Globular Figure.</hi> 'Tis a simple <hi>Body,</hi> having neither any of the
<hi>Lignous</hi> branched in it, nor any <hi>Calculous Knots.</hi> It is of the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
nature with the outer <hi>Parenchyma;</hi> but whether it be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
one with it, or be derived immediately from the <hi>Pith,</hi> my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
yet made, determine not.</p>
                  <p>4. §. The Original of the <hi>Calculary</hi> I seem to have neglected. But
hereof we may here best say, that whereas all the other <hi>Parts</hi> are <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential</hi>
and truly <hi>Vital;</hi> the <hi>Calculary</hi> is not: but that the several <hi>Knots</hi>
whereof it consists, are only so many meer <hi>Concretions</hi> or <hi>Precipitations</hi>
out of the <hi>Sap;</hi> as in <hi>Urines, Wines,</hi> and other <hi>Liquors,</hi> we often
see. And that the <hi>Precipitation</hi> is made by the mixture and re-action
of the <hi>Tinctures</hi> of the <hi>Lignous</hi> and <hi>Cortical Bodies</hi> upon each other:
Even as all <hi>Vegetable Nutrition</hi> or <hi>Fixation</hi> of <hi>Parts</hi> is also made by the
joynt efficiency of the two same <hi>Tinctures,</hi> as hath been said. Hence
we find, that as the <hi>Acetary</hi> hath no <hi>Branches</hi> of the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> so
neither hath it any <hi>Knots.</hi> Hence likewise it is, that we have so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
and contrary a tast in the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> beyond the <hi>Calculary,</hi> from
that in the <hi>Acetary:</hi> For whereas this is sour, that, wherein the said
<hi>Precipitations</hi> are made, is sweet; being much alike effect to what we
find in mixing of <hi>Corals,</hi> &amp;c. with <hi>Vinegar</hi> or other <hi>acid Liquors.</hi> The
<hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Pear,</hi> See in <hi>Tab.</hi> 4. But especially in the <hi>Figures</hi> belonging

5. §. IN A PLUM (to which the <hi>Cherry, Apricot, Peach, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut,</hi>
&amp;c. ought to be referr'd) there are four distinct <hi>Parts,</hi> the <hi>Pilling,</hi>
the <hi>Parenchyma, Branchery</hi> and <hi>Stone.</hi> The <hi>Pilling</hi> and <hi>Parenchyma</hi> are,
as to their Original, with those of an <hi>Apple</hi> or <hi>Pear,</hi> both alike. As
likewise the <hi>Brunchery;</hi> but differently ramified. In <hi>Plums</hi> (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
all) there are five main <hi>Out-Branches,</hi> which run along the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the <hi>Stone</hi> from the <hi>Basis</hi> to the point thereof, four of them by
one <hi>Ridge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 4. f. 15.</note> and one by the other opposite to it. In an <hi>Apricot</hi> there is
the same number, but the single <hi>Branch</hi> runs not upon the <hi>Surface,</hi> but
through the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Stone.</hi> There are likewise two or three
smaller <hi>Branches,</hi> which run in like manner under the other <hi>Ridge</hi> for
some space, and then advancing into the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> therein disperse
themselves: These latter sort in <hi>Peaches</hi> are numerous throughout.</p>
                  <p>6. §. But notwithstanding the different disposition of the <hi>Branches</hi>
of the <hi>Fruits</hi> aforesaid; yet is there one <hi>Branch</hi> dispos'd in one and
the same manner in them all. The entrance hereof into the <hi>Stone</hi> is at
its <hi>Basis;</hi> from whence running through its Body, and still inclining
or arching it self towards its <hi>Concave,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 4. f. 15.</note> is at last, about its <hi>Cone,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
emergent, where the <hi>Coats</hi> of the <hi>Seed</hi> are appendent to it. Of
the <hi>Seed-Branch</hi> 'tis therefore observable that after its entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Fruit,</hi> 'tis always prolonged therein to a considerable length;
as is seen not only in <hi>Apples,</hi> &amp;c. where the <hi>Seed</hi> stands a good distance
from the <hi>Stalk;</hi> but in <hi>Plums</hi> likewise, where it stands very near it;
in that here the <hi>Seed-Branch,</hi> as is said, never strikes through the <hi>Stone</hi>
into the <hi>Coats</hi> of the <hi>Seed</hi> directly, but runs through a <hi>Chanel</hi> cut in
the <hi>Stone,</hi> till it issues, near the <hi>Cone,</hi> into the <hi>Concave</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p>7. §. The <hi>Stone</hi> though it seem a simple Body, yet it is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of different ones. The Inner <hi>Part</hi> thereof, as it is by far the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
so is it the most <hi>dense, white, smooth</hi> and <hi>simple.</hi> The Original
is from the <hi>Pith;</hi> difficult, but curious to observe: For the <hi>Seed-Branch,</hi>
not striking directly and immediately quite through the
<hi>Basis</hi> of the <hi>Stone,</hi> but in the manner as is above described, carries a
considerable <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Pith,</hi> now gather'd round about it, as its <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchyma,</hi>
along with it self; which upon its entrance into the concave
of the <hi>Stone</hi> about its farther end, is there in part spread all over it, as
the <hi>Lining</hi> thereof. The outer and very much thicker <hi>Part,</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
partly of the like <hi>Precipitations</hi> or concrete Particles, as in a <hi>Pear;</hi>
being gathered here much more closely, not only to a <hi>Contiguity,</hi> but
a <hi>Coalition</hi> into one entire <hi>Stone;</hi> as we see in <hi>Pears</hi> themselves, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
towards the <hi>Cork,</hi> they gather into the like Stoniness; or as a
<hi>Stone, Mineral,</hi> or <hi>Animal,</hi> is oftentimes the product of accumulated
<hi>Gravel.</hi> But as the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is mixed with the <hi>Concretions</hi> in the
<hi>Calculary,</hi> so is it also, though not visibly, with these in the <hi>Stone,</hi>
the <hi>ground</hi> of the <hi>Stone</hi> being indeed a perfect <hi>Parenchyma;</hi> but by
the said <hi>Concretions</hi> so far alter'd, as to become dry, hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguishable
from them. All which Particulars, are observable
only in the several degrees of <hi>Growth</hi> in the young <hi>Fruit.</hi> And are
represented in <hi>Tab.</hi> 4. But especially by the several <hi>Figures</hi> belonging
to the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Fourth Parts</hi> of the <hi>Fourth Book.</hi>

8. §. IN A NUT (to which an <hi>Akern</hi> is analogous) there are
three general <hi>Parts,</hi> the <hi>Cap, Shell,</hi> and <hi>Pith.</hi> The <hi>Cap</hi> is constituted
of a <hi>Pilling</hi> and <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> derived from the <hi>Barque;</hi> and <hi>Ramulets</hi>
from the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> of the <hi>Branch.</hi> The <hi>Shell</hi> likewise is not one
simple Body, but compounded. The Superficial <hi>Part</hi> thereof is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated
from the <hi>Pilling</hi> or <hi>Skin</hi> of the <hi>Cap,</hi> from the inside whereof
it is, in a Duplicature, produc'd and spred over the <hi>Shell.</hi> Which, if
you look at the <hi>Basis</hi> of the <hi>Shell,</hi> is farther evident: for that being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuous
with the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Cap,</hi> without the interposure of the
<hi>Skin,</hi> the said superficial <hi>Part</hi> is there wanting. The thicker and inner
<hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Shell</hi> consisteth of the same <hi>Parenchyma</hi> as that of the <hi>Cap,</hi>
with a <hi>Congeries</hi> of <hi>Precipitations</hi> filled up, as in a <hi>Stone.</hi> And as the
<hi>Lignous Body</hi> is branched in a <hi>Stone,</hi> so, with some difference, in a
<hi>Shell.</hi> The <hi>outer Branches</hi> or <hi>Ramulets</hi> are numerous, each issuing out
of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Cap,</hi> and entring the <hi>Shell</hi> at the <hi>Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
of its <hi>Basis,</hi> and so running betwixt its superficial and inner
<hi>Parts</hi> towards the <hi>Cone,</hi> round about. The <hi>Inner</hi> or <hi>Seed-Branch</hi> is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
entring in, as do the other, at the <hi>Basis</hi> of the <hi>Shell,</hi> but at the
<hi>Center</hi> thereof: from whence it runs, not through the <hi>Shell,</hi> as in
<hi>Plums</hi> through the <hi>Stone;</hi> but through the <hi>Pith,</hi> as far as the <hi>Cone;</hi>
where the <hi>Coats</hi> of the <hi>Seed</hi> hang appendent to it. The <hi>Pith</hi> whether
derived from the same part both in name and nature in the <hi>Branch</hi>
and <hi>Stalk;</hi> or from the <hi>Cortical Body,</hi> I yet determine not. The
<hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Nut,</hi> See in the <hi>Figures</hi> belonging to the <hi>Third Part</hi> of the
<hi>Fourth Book.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. §. A BERRY, as a <hi>Gooseberry</hi> (to which <hi>Corinths, Grapes
Hips,</hi> &amp;c. are to be referr'd) consisteth, besides the <hi>Seed,</hi> of the
three general <hi>Parts, Pilling, Parenchyma</hi> and <hi>Branchery.</hi> The <hi>Pilling</hi>
is originated as in the foregoing <hi>Fruits.</hi> The <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is double,
as likewise in some other <hi>Berries.</hi> The <hi>outer</hi> is commonly, together
with the <hi>Pilling,</hi> call'd the <hi>Skin,</hi> and is that part we spit out, being
of a sour tast. Now as the <hi>Pilling</hi> is originated from the <hi>outer,</hi> so this
from the <hi>inner Part</hi> or the <hi>Barque;</hi> and accordingly the <hi>Pores</hi> thereof
may be observed plainly of a like shape with those both of the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Body</hi> and <hi>Pith.</hi> The <hi>Inner</hi> of <hi>Pulp</hi> is of a sweet taste, and is
the <hi>Part</hi> we eat: It is of a Substance so laxe and tender, as it would seem
to be only a thicker or jellied <hi>Juice;</hi> although this likewise be a true
<hi>Parenchyma,</hi> something like that of an <hi>Orange</hi> or <hi>Limon,</hi> with its
<hi>Pores</hi> all fill'd up with <hi>Liquor.</hi> The <hi>Branchery</hi> is likewise double:
The <hi>Exterior</hi> runs betwixt the <hi>Pilling</hi> and <hi>Outer Parenchyma</hi> in arched
<hi>Lines,</hi> from the <hi>Stalk</hi> to the <hi>Stool</hi> of the <hi>Flower.</hi> These <hi>outer Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
though of various number at the <hi>Stalk,</hi> yet at the <hi>Cork</hi> are
usually ten principal ones; five for the five <hi>Leaves</hi> of the <hi>Flower,</hi>
and five for the <hi>Attire.</hi> The <hi>Inner main Branches</hi> are two, diametrical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opposite to each other, and at the <hi>Cork</hi> with the other inosculated.
From these two are branched other smaller, every one having a <hi>Seed</hi>
appendent to it, whose <hi>Coats</hi> it entreth by a double <hi>Filament,</hi> one at
the <hi>Basis,</hi> the other at the <hi>Cone.</hi> They are all very white and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and by a slaunt cut, may be observ'd concave; thus represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves analogous to so many true <hi>spermatick Vessels.</hi> The
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100350:50"/>
                     <hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Gooseberry,</hi> See in the <hi>Figures</hi> belonging to the <hi>Third
Part</hi> of the <hi>Fourth Book.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. §. The Uses of <hi>Fruits</hi> are for <hi>Man,</hi> (sometimes also other
<hi>Animals,</hi> as are <hi>Akerns</hi> and <hi>Haws)</hi> and for the <hi>Seed.</hi> For <hi>Man,</hi> they
are so variously desirable, that till our <hi>Orchards</hi> and <hi>Store-Chambers,
Confectioners-Stoves</hi> and <hi>Apothecaries-Shops,</hi> our <hi>Ladies Closets,</hi> their
<hi>Tables</hi> or <hi>Hands</hi> are empty of them, I shall not need to enquire for
what. If it be asked, how the <hi>Fruit</hi> becomes, generally above all
the other <hi>Parts,</hi> so pleasant a Meat? It is partly from the <hi>Sap,</hi> the
grosser portion thereof being deposited in the <hi>Leaves,</hi> and so the
purer hereunto reserved. Partly from the <hi>Globular Figure</hi> of the
<hi>Fruit.</hi> For the <hi>Sap</hi> being thus in a greater quantity herein, and in
all Parts equally diffus'd, the <hi>Concoction</hi> hereof, as in a <hi>Vessel,</hi> is with
greatest advantage favoured and promoted. Wherefore all <hi>Fruits,</hi>
which we eat raw, how small soever, are of a <hi>Globular</hi> Form, or
thereunto approaching; and the nearer, the delicater; amongst <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
the <hi>Pipin;</hi> amongst <hi>Pears,</hi> the <hi>Burgundian;</hi> and amongst all
<hi>Fruits,</hi> the <hi>Grape;</hi> and amongst <hi>Grapes,</hi> the roundest, are of all, the
most dainty.</p>
                  <p>11. §. The visible cause of this <hi>Globular Figure,</hi> is the <hi>Flower;</hi>
or the Inosculation of all the main <hi>Branches</hi> at the <hi>Stool</hi> of the <hi>Flower;</hi>
and upon the fall of the <hi>Flower,</hi> the obtuseness, and with <hi>Wind</hi> and
<hi>Sun,</hi> as it were the <hi>seaing</hi> of their several ends: For thus the <hi>Sap</hi>
entering the <hi>Fruit,</hi> being not able to effect, either a <hi>Disunion,</hi> or a
<hi>shooting</hi> forth of the said <hi>Branches,</hi> and so to carry on their <hi>Growth</hi>
in length; they must of necessity be enarch'd, and with the <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma</hi>
more and more expand themselves. Whereas were they
disposed and qualified otherwise, than as is said; instead of forming
a <hi>Fruit</hi> within bounds, they would run out into all extravagance, and
even into another little <hi>Tree</hi> or <hi>Leafy Growth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. §. To the <hi>Seed,</hi> the <hi>Fruit</hi> is serviceable; First, in order to
its being supply'd with a due and most convenient <hi>Sap,</hi> the greater
part thereof, and that which is less elaborated, being, in its passage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Seed,</hi> thereinto received; the <hi>Fruit</hi> doing the same office
to the <hi>Seed,</hi> which the <hi>Leaves</hi> do to the <hi>Fruit;</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> in the <hi>Fruit</hi>
being, in a laxe comparison, as the <hi>Wine;</hi> and that for the <hi>Seed,</hi> a
small part of the highest Spirit rectified from it.</p>
                  <p>13. §. So likewise for its Protection, in order to the prosperous
carrying on and perfecting of its generation, and security being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
Which protection it gives not only to the Seminal <hi>Sap</hi> and <hi>Seed</hi>
it self, but ever also to its <hi>Seed-Branch.</hi> Thus we see an <hi>Apple,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that it is it self of ample compass, for the sake of its <hi>Seed,</hi> hath
likewise its <hi>Coar;</hi> as if it were not sufficient, that the Walls of their
Room are so very thick, unless also <hi>wainscoated.</hi> In a <hi>Pear</hi> again,
where the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is of less compass than that of an <hi>Apple,</hi> to what
protection this affords, that of the <hi>Calculary</hi> is super-added. But in a
<hi>Plum,</hi> where the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is exceeding tender, and in a <hi>Peach,</hi> which
hangs late, and till Autumn Frosts approach, we have not only the
Rubbish of a <hi>Calculary,</hi> but stout Stone-Walls. Within which also,
not only the <hi>Seed</hi> it self, but the <hi>Seed-Branch</hi> is evermore immur'd.
Lastly, in a <hi>Nut,</hi> where the <hi>Shell</hi> being not surrounded with a <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma,</hi>
that protection is wanting without, 'tis answer'd by an ample
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100350:50"/>
                     <hi>Pith</hi> within it; and the <hi>Seed-Branch</hi> likewise included, not meerly
in the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Shell,</hi> as in a <hi>Plum,</hi> but within the <hi>Pith</hi> it self.
So necessary is this design, that what the Hen by Incubation or
Hovering, is to the Egg or Chick; that the whole <hi>Fruit,</hi> by compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
is to the <hi>Seed.</hi>

of <hi>Vegetation</hi> is the <hi>Seed.</hi> How it is the former, and
in its state apt for <hi>Vegetation,</hi> hath already been seen.
How the latter, and in its state of Generation, we
shall now lastly enquire. In doing which, what in
the other state, was either not distinctly existent, or
not so apparent, or not so intelligible, will occur.</p>
                  <p>2. §. The two general <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Seed</hi> are its
<hi>Covers</hi> and <hi>Body.</hi> The <hi>Covers</hi> in this estate are usually <hi>Four.</hi> The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
we may call the <hi>Case.</hi> 'Tis of a very various form; sometimes a
<hi>Pouch,</hi> as in <hi>Nasturtium, Cochlearia;</hi> a <hi>Cod,</hi> as in all <hi>Pulse, Galega;</hi>
sometimes not entire, but parted, or otherwise open, as in <hi>Sorrel,
Knotgrass;</hi> with many other forms: I think alwaies more heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
to that of the <hi>Seed,</hi> by which it differs from the proper <hi>Coats.</hi>
To this the <hi>Caps</hi> of <hi>Nuts,</hi> and the <hi>Parenchyma's</hi> of other <hi>Fruits</hi> are
analogous.</p>
                  <p>3. §. The two next are properly the <hi>Coats.</hi> In a <hi>Bean</hi> especially,
and the like; from whence, to avoyd Confusion, the denomination
may run common to the responding <hi>Covers</hi> of other <hi>Seeds.</hi> The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the outer, is of all degrees, from White to the Blackness of <hi>Jett.</hi>
It's Figure sometimes Kidney'd, as in <hi>Alcea, Behen, Poppy;</hi> Triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
as in <hi>Polygonatum, Sorrel;</hi> Spherically triangular, in <hi>Mentha, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lissa;</hi>
Circular, in <hi>Leucoium, Amaranthus;</hi> Globular, in <hi>Napus, Aspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rula;</hi>

as, if I mistake not, in <hi>Jacobaea;</hi> Pyramidal, in <hi>Geranium Althaeae
fol.</hi> with many other differences. But the Perfection of one or two
of the said Figures lieth in the <hi>Case.</hi> So that, as all <hi>Lines</hi> and <hi>Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
are in the <hi>Leaf</hi> and <hi>Flower;</hi> so all Regular <hi>Solids</hi> in the <hi>Seed;</hi> or
rather in its <hi>Covers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. §. 'Tis sometimes glistering, as in <hi>Speculun Veneris;</hi> Rough-cast,
in <hi>Catanance;</hi> Studded, in <hi>Behen, Balttaria;</hi> Favous, in <hi>Papaver, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirrhinum,

more, before the <hi>Seeds</hi> have lain long by; Pounced, in <hi>Phalangium Cretae,

                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:100350:51"/>
resembling the <hi>Fibers</hi> of the <hi>Ears</hi> of the <hi>Heart;</hi> some just <hi>Quinquenerval,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>5. §. The <hi>Covers</hi> of not only <hi>Quince-Seeds,</hi> and those of <hi>Psyllium</hi>
(more usually taken notice of) but those also of <hi>Horminum, Nasturtium,
Eruca, Camelina, Ocymum,</hi> and divers others, have a <hi>Mucilage.</hi> Which,
though it be not visible when the <hi>Seeds</hi> are throughly dry; yet lying
a while in some warm Liquor, or only on the Tongue, it swells more
or less, and upon them all fairly shews it self, On that of <hi>Ocymum</hi> it
appears grayish; on the other, transparent; and on that of <hi>Nastur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium
Hortense</hi> very large; even emulous of the inner Pulp surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>Gooseberry-Seed.</hi> The putting of <hi>Clary-seed</hi> into the Eye, may
have been brought into use from this <hi>Mucilage,</hi> by which alone it
may become Medicinal. And thus far of the <hi>Superficies,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. §. The <hi>nature</hi> of the outer <hi>Coat</hi> is also various, <hi>Membranous,
Cartilaginous</hi> and <hi>Stony;</hi> the like <hi>Precipitations</hi> being sometimes made
herein, as in a <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Shell;</hi> as in that of the <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Carthamum,
Lithospermum</hi> and others. The Designment hereof, being either with
respect to the <hi>Seed</hi> in its state of Generation; as where the <hi>Case</hi> is
either wanting, or at least insufficient of it self, there for its due
protection and warmth. Or, in its state of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> for the better
Fermenting of its <hi>Tinctures</hi> and <hi>Sap;</hi> the Fermentations of some <hi>Seeds</hi>
not well proceeding, unless they lie in their <hi>Stony Casks</hi> in the Ground,
like Bottled Liquors in Sand.</p>
                  <p>7. §. All <hi>Seeds</hi> have their outer <hi>Covers</hi> open; either by a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Foramen,</hi> as in <hi>Beans,</hi> and other <hi>Pulse,</hi> as is said; or by the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off of the <hi>Seed</hi> from its <hi>Peduncle</hi> or <hi>Stool,</hi> as in those in <hi>Cucumber,
Cichory;</hi> or by the entering and passage of a <hi>Branch</hi> or <hi>Branches,</hi> not
only into the Concave thereof near the Cone, but also through the
Cone it self; as in <hi>Shells</hi> and <hi>Stones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. §. For the sake of this <hi>aperture</hi> it is, that <hi>Akerns, Nuts, Beans,
Cucumbers,</hi> and most other <hi>Seeds,</hi> are in their formation so placed, that
the <hi>Radicle</hi> still standeth next to it; That So, upon <hi>Vegetation,</hi> it may
have a free and ready passage into the Mould.</p>
                  <p>9. §. The Original of the outer <hi>Coat,</hi> though from Parts of the
same substantial nature, yet is differently made. In a <hi>Plum,</hi> the <hi>Seed-Branch</hi>
which runns, as is described, through the <hi>Stone,</hi> is not naked,
but, as is said, invested with a thin <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> which it carries from
the <hi>Stalk</hi> along with it; and which, by the <hi>Ramification</hi> of the said
<hi>Branch</hi> within the <hi>Stone,</hi> is, in part, dilated into a <hi>Coat.</hi> That of a
<hi>Bean</hi> is from the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Cod;</hi> the superficial part of which
<hi>Parenchyma,</hi> upon the large <hi>peduncle</hi> of the <hi>Bean</hi> becoming a thin <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,</hi>
and upon the <hi>Bean</hi> it self a <hi>Cartilaginous Coat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. §. The Original of the inner <hi>Coat</hi> of the <hi>Bean</hi> is likewise from
the inner part of the said <hi>Parenchyma;</hi> which first is spred into a long
<hi>Cake,</hi> or that which with the <hi>Seed-Branch</hi> maketh the <hi>Penduncle</hi> of the
<hi>Bean;</hi> under which <hi>Cake,</hi> there is usually a black part or spot; by the
length of which, the inner part of the <hi>Cake</hi> is next inserted into the
outer <hi>Coat,</hi> and spred all over the Concave thereof, and so becomes
the inner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:100350:51"/>
11. §. Of this Inner <hi>Coat</hi> it is very observable, That allthough
when the <hi>Seed</hi> is grown old and dry, 'tis shrunk up, and in most <hi>Seeds,</hi>
so far, as scarcely to be discern'd; yet in its first and juvenile Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it is a very Spongy and Sappy body; and is then likewise (as the
<hi>Womb</hi> in a Pregnant <hi>Animal)</hi> in proportion, very thick and bulky.
In a <hi>Bean,</hi> even as one of the <hi>Lobes</hi> it self: And in a <hi>Plum</hi> or <hi>Apricot,</hi>
I think I may safely say, half an hundred times thicker than afterwards,
when it is dried and shrunk up, and can scarcely be distinguished
from the upper <hi>Coat.</hi> Upon which Accounts it is, in this estate a true
and fair <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> The Delineation hereof, See in the <hi>Figures</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the <hi>Fourth Part</hi> of the <hi>Fourth Book.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. §. In this Inner <hi>Coat</hi> in a <hi>Bean,</hi> the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> or <hi>Seed-Branch</hi>
is distributed: Sometimes, as in <hi>French-Beans,</hi> throughout the
whole <hi>Coat,</hi> as it is in a <hi>Leaf.</hi> In the Great <hi>Garden-Bean,</hi> upon its first
entrance, it is bipartite, and so in small <hi>Branches</hi> runs along the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi>
of the <hi>Coat,</hi> all meeting and making a kind of <hi>Reticulation</hi> against
the Belly of the <hi>Bean.</hi> In the same manner the main <hi>Branches</hi> in the
outer <hi>Coat</hi> of a <hi>Kernel,</hi> circling themselves on both hands from the
place of their first entrance, at last meet, and mutually inosculate;
as the <hi>Veins</hi> in the <hi>Kidneys</hi> of a Man or any <hi>Quadrupede;</hi> Or the <hi>Carotick
Arteries</hi> in the <hi>Braine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. §. So that all the <hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Vegetable,</hi> the <hi>Root, Trunk, Branch,
Leaf, Flower, Fruit</hi> and <hi>Seed,</hi> are still made up of <hi>Two</hi> Substantially
different Bodies.</p>
                  <p>14. §. And as every <hi>Part</hi> hath <hi>Two,</hi> so the whole <hi>Vegetable</hi> taken
together, is a composition of <hi>Two</hi> only, and no more: All properly
<hi>Woody Parts, Strings</hi> and <hi>Fibers,</hi> are <hi>One Body:</hi> All simple <hi>Barques,
Piths, Parenchyma's</hi> and <hi>Pulps,</hi> and as to their substantial Nature, <hi>Pills</hi>
and <hi>Skins</hi> likewise, all but <hi>One Body:</hi> the several <hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Vegetable</hi>
all differing from each other, only by the various <hi>Proportions</hi> and
<hi>Mixtures,</hi> and variated <hi>Pores</hi> and <hi>Structure</hi> of these <hi>Two Bodies.</hi> What
from these two general Observations might reasonably be inferr'd, I
shall not now mention.</p>
                  <p>15. §. The Fourth or Innermost <hi>Cover</hi> we may call the <hi>Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine.</hi>
The sight of which, by cutting off the <hi>Coats</hi> of an <hi>Infant-Bean,</hi> at
the Cone thereof, in very thin Slices, and with great Caution, may
be obtain'd. While unbroken, 'tis transparent; being torn and taken
off, it gathers up into the likeness of a Jelly, or that we call the <hi>Tredle</hi>
of an Egg, when rear-boyl'd. This <hi>Membrance</hi> in larger or elder
<hi>Beans,</hi> is not to be found distinct. But (as far as our Enquiries yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover)
it may in most other <hi>Seeds,</hi> even full grown, be distinctly seen; as
in those of <hi>Cucumber, Colocynthis, Burdock, Carthamum, Gromwel, Endive,
Mallows,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Tab. 4. f. 16.</note> 'Tis usually so very thin, as in the above-nam'd, as
very difficultly to be discover'd. But in some <hi>Kernels,</hi> as of <hi>Apricots,</hi>
'tis very thick; and most remarquably such, in some other <hi>Seeds.</hi> That
all these have the Analogy of one and the same <hi>Cover,</hi> which I call the
<hi>Secondine,</hi> is most probably argu'd from their alike Natures; being all
of them plain simple <hi>Membranes,</hi> with not the least <hi>Fibre</hi> of the <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Body</hi> or <hi>Seed Branch,</hi> visibly distributed in them: As also from their
Texture, which is in all of them more close. See this <hi>Part</hi> in <hi>Tab.</hi> 4. As
also amongst the <hi>Figures</hi> belonging to the <hi>Fourth Part</hi> of the <hi>Fourth
Book.</hi>
                  </p>

16. §. The <hi>Concave</hi> of this <hi>Membrane</hi> is filled with a most transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<hi>Liquor,</hi> out of which the <hi>Seed</hi> is formed; as in cutting a <hi>petite</hi>
and <hi>Infant-Bean,</hi> may be seen; and yet better in a young <hi>Walnut.</hi> In
<hi>Beans</hi> I have observed it to turn, upon boyling, into a tender white
<hi>Coagulum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. §. Through this <hi>Membrane,</hi> the <hi>Lignous Body</hi> or <hi>Seed-Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
distributed in the inner <hi>Coat,</hi> at last shoot downright two slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Fibres,</hi> like two <hi>Navel-strings,</hi> one into each <hi>Lobe</hi> of the <hi>Bean.</hi>
The places where the said <hi>Fibres</hi> shoot into the <hi>Lobes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 4. f. 18.</note> are near the
<hi>Basis</hi> of the <hi>Radicle;</hi> and by their <hi>Blackishness</hi> well enough remark'd:
but the <hi>Fibers</hi> themselves are so very small, as scarcely to be discern'd.
Yet in a <hi>Lupine,</hi> of the larger kind, both the <hi>places</hi> where the <hi>Navel-Fibres</hi>
shoot into the <hi>Lobes</hi> (which here from the <hi>Basis</hi> of the <hi>Radicle</hi>
is more remote) and the <hi>Fibres</hi> themselves, are fairly visible. For
the <hi>Seed-Branch,</hi> upon its entrance into the <hi>Coat</hi> of the <hi>Lupine,</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
divided into two <hi>main Branches,</hi> and those two into other less;
whereof some underly, others aloft, run along the <hi>Coat,</hi> and towards
its other end meet and are inosculated: where about, two opposite,
shallow, round, and most minute <hi>Cavities,</hi> answerable to two <hi>Specks</hi> of
a <hi>Cartilaginous</hi> gloss, one in either <hi>Lobe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 4. f. 17.</note> may be observed; which
<hi>Specks</hi> are the ends of the said <hi>Navel-Fibres,</hi> upon the ripening of the
<hi>Seed</hi> there broken off. These <hi>Fibres</hi> from the <hi>Superficies</hi> of each <hi>Lobe,</hi>
descend a little way directly down: presently, each is divided into
two <hi>Branches,</hi> one distributed into the <hi>Lobes,</hi> the other into the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicle</hi>
and <hi>Plume,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 4. f. 18.</note> in the manner as in the <hi>First Chapter</hi> is described.
And thus far the History. I shall now only with a brief account of the
<hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> as hereupon dependent, conclude this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
                  <p>18. §. LET US say then,<note place="margin">An Account of the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </note> that the <hi>Sap</hi> having in the <hi>Root, Trunk</hi> and
<hi>Leaves,</hi> passed divers <hi>Concoctions</hi> and <hi>Separations,</hi> in the manner as they
are said to be perform'd therein; 'tis now at last, in some good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity,
advanced towards the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>19. §. The more copious and cruder part hereof is again separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by a free reception into the <hi>Fruit,</hi> or other <hi>Part</hi> analogous to it:
being either sufficiently ample to contain it, or at least laxe enough for
its transpiration, and so its due discharge. The more Essential part is
into the <hi>Seed-Branch</hi> or <hi>Branches</hi> entertian'd. Which, because they are
evermore of a very considerable length, and of a Constitution very fine,
the said <hi>Sap</hi> thus becomes in its Current therein as in the <hi>Spermatick
Vessels,</hi> still more mature.</p>
                  <p>20. § In this mature estate, from the <hi>Seed-Branch</hi> into the <hi>Coats</hi>
of the <hi>Seed,</hi> as into the <hi>Womb,</hi> 'tis next delivered up. The meaner
part hereof again, to the <hi>Outer,</hi> as <hi>Aliment</hi> good enough, is supplied.
The siner part is transmitted to the <hi>Inner;</hi> which being, as is said, a
<hi>Parenechymous</hi> and more spatious <hi>Body,</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> therefore is not herein,
as in the <hi>Outer,</hi> a meer <hi>Aliment;</hi> but in order to its being, by <hi>Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
farther prepared.</p>
                  <p>21. §. Yet the Outer <hi>Coat,</hi> being on the contray hard and dense;
for that reason, as it admitteth not the Fermentation of the <hi>Sap</hi> so well
within it self; so doth it the more promote and favour it in the Inner;
being Bounds both to it and its <hi>Sap;</hi> and also quickneth the <hi>process</hi> of
the whole Work in the formation of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:100350:52"/>
22. §. Nor doth the Outer <hi>Coat,</hi> for the same reason, more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
than declare the purity of the <hi>Sap</hi> now contained in the Inner:
For being more hard and dense, and so not perspirable, must needs
suppose the Parts of the <hi>Sap</hi> encompassed by it, since thus uncapable of
any evacuation, to be therefore all so choice, as not to need it.</p>
                  <p>23. §. The <hi>Sap</hi> being thus prepared in the Inner <hi>Coat,</hi> as a Liquor
now apt to be the <hi>Substratum</hi> of the future <hi>Seed-Embrio;</hi> by fresh sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
is thence discharg'd. Yet that it may not be over-copious;
which, because of the laxity of the Inner <hi>Coat,</hi> from whence it issues,
it might easily be: therefore, as the said Inner <hi>Coat</hi> is bounded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
by the upper <hi>Coat;</hi> so by the <hi>Secundine,</hi> is it bounded within.
Through which <hi>Secundine</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> being filtr'd, or, as it were, transpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
the depositure hereof, answerable to the <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> in an
Egg, or to the <hi>Semen Mulibre,</hi> into its Concave at last is made.</p>
                  <p>24. §. The other part of the purest <hi>Sap</hi> embosom'd in the <hi>Ramu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets</hi>
of the <hi>Seed-Branch,</hi> runs a Circle, or some progress therein; and
so becomes, as the <hi>Semen Masculinum,</hi> yet more elabortè.</p>
                  <p>25. § Wherein also, lest its Current should be too copious or
precipitant, by their <hi>co-arcture</hi> and <hi>divarication</hi> where they are inoscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
it is retarded; the noblest portion only obtaining a pass.</p>
                  <p>26. §. With this purest <hi>Sap,</hi> the said <hi>Ramulets</hi> being supplied,
from thence at last, the <hi>Navel-Fibres</hi> shoot (as the primitive <hi>Artery</hi>
into the <hi>Colliquamentum)</hi> through the <hi>Secundine</hi> into the aforesaid <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor</hi>
deposited
therein.</p>
                  <p>27. §. Into which <hi>Liquor,</hi> being now shot, and its own proper
<hi>Sap</hi> or <hi>Tinctures</hi> mixed therewith, it <hi>strikes</hi> it thus into a <hi>Coagulum;</hi>
or of a <hi>Liquor,</hi> it becomes a <hi>Body consistent</hi> and truly <hi>Parenchymous.</hi>
And the supply of the said <hi>Liquor</hi> still continu'd, and the shooting of
the <hi>Navel-Fibres,</hi> as is above described, still carried on, the said <hi>Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
or <hi>Fixation</hi> is therewith likewise.</p>
                  <p>28. §. And in the Interim of the <hi>Coagulation,</hi> a gentle <hi>Fermentation</hi>
being also made, the said <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or <hi>Coagulum</hi> becometh such, not
of any Texture indifferently, but is thus raised (as we see Bread in Bak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
into a <hi>Congeries</hi> of <hi>Bladders:</hi> For such is the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the
whole <hi>Seed.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the Dedication of <hi>Books</hi> were not in use;
yet here, I think, I might have been a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.
The promotion of <hi>Phytological
Science</hi> is one Part of <hi>Your</hi> Work; and 'tis
<hi>You</hi> have called me to the management of
this Part; for some time, have intrusted me
herein; and by <hi>Your</hi> most favourable and candid accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of what I have performed thus far, have encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
me hereunto: I therefore present but <hi>Your</hi> Own,
into <hi>Your</hi> Hands.</p>
                  <p>The great Honour and Advantage of <hi>Your</hi> Fellowship,
I first obtained, by Mediation of Dr. <hi>Wilkins,</hi> the late most
Reverend <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Chester.</hi> Whom I cannot name,
without saying thus much of him, That He was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb facs="tcp:100350:55"/>
of that eminent and happy Worth, which, as it was
too good, to fear envy; so is it too great, to need an Elogie.</p>
                  <p>With Him, it was, <hi>You</hi> were pleased to commit to Me,
the further prosecution of this <hi>Work;</hi> the Beginnings
whereof, were by <hi>Your Order</hi> formerly made publique.
Had I consulted my own Abilities altogether, I should
scarcely have ventured upon it; seeing very little, for
which I could think well of my self, saving, That I had
learned, upon good grounds, to think of <hi>You</hi> with greatest
Honour. But I also considered, That to insist hereon too
much, might be a reflection upon <hi>Your</hi> Judgments, who had
thought fit to make choice of Me. And, That <hi>You</hi> were
not more the Patrons of Wit, than of Industry; and of
All, who shall endeavour to find out, or to confirm the
Truth of Things. Withal, I looked upon <hi>Nature,</hi> as a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
so infinitely full; that as all Men together, cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haust
it; so no Man, but may find out somewhat therein,
if he be resolved to Try.</p>
                  <p>In compliance therefore with <hi>Your</hi> Commands, I have
hereunto devoted a very considerable part of my Time.
These, adding force to my own Desires, of being somewhat
instrumental to the Improvement of Medicinal, and other
wholesom Knowledge: if peradventure, as we increase
herein, we may become better, and more happy. As to
which Improvement, though I could not hope; yet, I
would not dispair. I have already prepared the Soil, and
made some Plantation: what remaineth behind, and the
Vintage of the whole, will depend much upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Influence of <hi>Your</hi> Beams: for how unpromising
soever the Stock may be; yet the Fruit cannot but be
somewhat matured, upon which <hi>You</hi> are pleased to shine.
I am also confident, that the same Nobilty and Goodness,
which accept the endeavours, will likewise pardon the
faults, of,</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EING TO speak of <hi>Roots;</hi> it is requisite, for
our better understanding of what follows, that some
things, as to their <hi>Original, Figures, Motions</hi> and
<hi>Ages,</hi> be premised.</p>
                     <p>1. §. <hi>Roots,</hi> taken altogether, have a Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Original. Either from the <hi>Radicle;</hi> as all
<hi>Roots</hi> which come of the <hi>Seed:</hi> or from the <hi>Trunk</hi>
or <hi>Caulis,</hi> above ground; as in <hi>Strawberry, Chamaemile,</hi> and many other
<hi>Creepers:</hi> or from the <hi>Trunk</hi> or <hi>Caulis,</hi> after it is sunk under ground;
as in <hi>Primrose, Bistort,</hi> and many others; and presently shall be shewed
how.</p>
                     <p>2. §. In the Growth of a <hi>Bud,</hi> and of a <hi>Trunk-Root,</hi> there is
this observable difference; That the former, carries along with it, some
portion of every <hi>Part</hi> in the <hi>Trunk</hi> or <hi>Stalk;</hi> whereof it is a <hi>Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</hi>
The latter, always shoots forth, by making a Rupture in the
<hi>Barque,</hi> which it leaves behind, and proceeds only from the inner part
of the <hi>Stalk.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:100350:57"/>
3. §. As also, That in a <hi>Bud,</hi> the <hi>Lignous Part</hi> is spread abroad,
so as to encompass a <hi>Pith.</hi> Whereas in a <hi>Trunk-Root,</hi> it makes a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Thred standing in the Center. Which is the Cause of its descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the Ground: as is already, in the <hi>First <hi>Book,</hi>
                        </hi> and shall in
This be further shewed.</p>
                     <p>4. §. ROOTS are generally distinguished, as to their <hi>Figures,</hi>
in being more Entrie, as is that of <hi>Liquirish;</hi> or Parted, as of St. <hi>Johns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort.</hi>
Parted or Forked, either at the Bottom, as most <hi>Roots;</hi> or at
the Top, as <hi>Dandelyon,</hi> and some others. A thing very odd, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible,
without the knowledge of the <hi>Motions</hi> of <hi>Roots;</hi> whereof
presently.</p>
                     <p>5. §. Parted, again, are either Ramified, as that of <hi>Cumfry;</hi> or
Manifold, as of <hi>Crowfoot:</hi> both are Parted; but the former, by the
subdivision of greater <hi>Branches,</hi> into lesser; these, when divers <hi>Strings,</hi>
have all their distinct original from one <hi>Head.</hi> Some are Straight, as a
<hi>Radish;</hi> others Crooked, as <hi>Bistort.</hi> Smooth, as <hi>Bugloss;</hi> or Stringy
all round about, as <hi>Columbine.</hi> And to <hi>Carnations,</hi> this seems to be
peculiar, That sometimes many of the <hi>Strings</hi> run parallell with the
<hi>Wood</hi> of the great <hi>Root,</hi> through the <hi>Barque,</hi> or betwixt the <hi>Wood</hi> and
the <hi>Barque.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. Again, some are Thick, as <hi>Rhubarb;</hi> Slender, as the <hi>Vine.</hi>
Long, as <hi>Fenil;</hi> Short, as a <hi>Turnep:</hi> which are distinct from Great and
Little; in that these, are so called with respect to several <hi>Roots;</hi> those,
with respect to the several Dimensions of one. Short, are Stubbed, as
<hi>Iris tuberosa;</hi> or Round, as <hi>Dracontium.</hi> Round are Tuberous, or Simply
Knobbed, as <hi>Rape-Crowfoot;</hi> Bulbous, that is Scaled, as some Lilys; or
Shell'd, as an <hi>Onion.</hi> Where note, That all Bulbous <hi>Roots,</hi> are, as it
were, Hermaphrodites, or <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Trunk</hi> both together: for the
<hi>Strings</hi> only, are absolute <hi>Roots;</hi> the <hi>Bulb,</hi> actually containing those
<hi>Parts,</hi> which springing up, make the <hi>Leaves</hi> or <hi>Body;</hi> and is, as it were,
a Great <hi>Bud</hi> under ground.</p>
                     <p>7. §. <hi>Roots,</hi> again, are Even or Uneven; Even, are Cylindrical,
as <hi>Eryngo;</hi> or Pyramidal, as <hi>Borage.</hi> Growing smaller Downwards,
as do most; or Upwards, as <hi>Skirrets.</hi> Uneven, are Pitted, as <hi>Potato's,</hi>
where the <hi>Eyes</hi> or <hi>Buds</hi> of the future <hi>Trunks</hi> lie inward; or Knotted,
as <hi>Jerusalem-Artichoke;</hi> where they stand out. These Differences, are
also Compounded: so some <hi>Roots</hi> are both Entire and Smooth, as
<hi>Peony;</hi> others Entire, but Stringy, as <hi>Clary:</hi> that is, neither Ramifi'd,
nor yet Brushy, or divided at the Top into severall small <hi>Strings;</hi> but a
Single <hi>Root</hi> surrounded with many Hairy <hi>Threds.</hi> Some both Plain in
some parts, and Knobbed in others, as <hi>Filipendula, Lilium non bulbosum,</hi>
and others.</p>
                     <p>8. §. Some also have two or more <hi>Roots;</hi> and those of one Kind:
of which, some are distinctly fastend to the bottome of the <hi>Stalk,</hi> as in
<hi>Dogstones;</hi> some stand one under another, so as only the uppermost is
fasten'd to the <hi>Stalk,</hi> as in <hi>Dragon, Crocus,</hi> and others. And there are
some, which have not only two <hi>Roots,</hi> at the same time; but those al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of two distinct Kinds, as in <hi>Bistort;</hi> one of them, a slender strait
Cylindrick and horizontall <hi>Root;</hi> the other large and crooked, and
bred of the Descending <hi>Trunk;</hi> as in speaking next of the <hi>Motions</hi> of
<hi>Roots,</hi> will be understood, how. All which, with other Differences
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100350:57"/>
by Those that undertake the <hi>Descriptions</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> are accurately to
be Noted. But the Differences, above mentioned, will serve for our
present Purpose.</p>
                     <p>9. §. THE MOTIONS of <hi>Roots</hi> are also divers. Sometimes
Level, as are those of <hi>Hops, Ammi, Cinquefoyle;</hi> and all such as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>Creep.</hi> Sometimes Perpendicular, as that of <hi>Parsnep:</hi> Which is
different from Straightness; for some Straight <hi>Roots,</hi> are Level. Both
of them are either Shallow or Deep: some run Level, and near the
<hi>Turf,</hi> as <hi>Woodbind, Wild Anenomy;</hi> others lower, as <hi>Dogs-Grass.</hi> Some
strike down, but a little way, as <hi>Stramonium;</hi> others grow deep, as
<hi>Horse-Radish:</hi> Which is different from being Long; for many long
<hi>Roots,</hi> are Level, as <hi>Hops.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. §. Some again Descend, as <hi>Tulips,</hi> and other Bulbous <hi>Roots,</hi>
which differs from growing only Downwards; in that here, the
<hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Root</hi> is Immoveable; but in Descending, the whole <hi>Root</hi>
obteineth different Places, running deeper, time after time, into the
<hi>Earth.</hi> Some also Ascend, sometimes, and in some part, appearing
above ground, as <hi>Turneps.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. §. These <hi>Motions</hi> are also Compounded; both in respect of
the several Parts of the <hi>Root,</hi> and of several Times. So the main
<hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Primrose,</hi> is Level; the Strings are Perpendicular. The
<hi>Roots</hi> of most <hi>Seedlings</hi> grow Downward and Upward, or shoot out
in length at both Ends, at the same time. Those of <hi>Bistort, Iris,</hi>
and some others, grow, in part, both Downward and Upward at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times: Whence it is, that <hi>Bistort</hi> is Crooked, with some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to an S, according to its <hi>Name;</hi> And that some Parts of <hi>Iris-Root</hi>
appear oftentimes above the ground.</p>
                     <p>12. §. There is also another <hi>Motion,</hi> in some <hi>Roots,</hi> not heeded;
and that is <hi>Contortion:</hi> whereby, without being moved out of their
Place, they are Writhed or Twisted; as a piece of Cloath is, when
the Water is wrung out of it; as in <hi>Carduus, Sonchus,</hi> and others:
whether always I cannot say. This <hi>Mation</hi> cannot be noted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
stripping off the <hi>Barque;</hi> whereby the <hi>Vessels</hi> may be seen, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
to make two or three Circumvolutions. This <hi>Motion</hi> seems to
be governed by the winding of the <hi>Stalk;</hi> and therefore to begin at
the Head, and terminate at the Poynt or lower end of the <hi>Root,</hi> which
is immoveable.</p>
                     <p>13. §. BUT ABOVE all the <hi>Motions</hi> of <hi>Roots,</hi> not observed,
the most remarkable is that of DESCENT. Which, although it hath
been noted, by some <hi>Botanicks,</hi> of <hi>Bulbous Roots;</hi> yet of these only:
Whereas it is the Property, of a great many more; and those, of very
different Kinds; probably, of the far greater number of <hi>Perennial Roots</hi>
of <hi>Herbs;</hi> as of <hi>Arum, Rape-Crowfoot, Valerian, Brownwort, Bears<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot,
Tansy, Lychnis, Sampier, Primrose, Ammi, Avens, Wood-sorrel,
Iris,</hi> and others. Of all which <hi>Plants,</hi> it is very observable, That
their <hi>Root,</hi> is annually <hi>renewed,</hi> or <hi>repaired,</hi> out of the <hi>Trunk</hi> or <hi>Stalk</hi>
it self. That is to say, The <hi>Basis</hi> of the <hi>Stalk</hi> continually, and by
insensible Degrees, descending below the surface of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and
hiding it self therein; is thus, both in Nature, Place, and Office chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into a true <hi>Root.</hi> Which <hi>Root,</hi> by the continuance of the said
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100350:58"/>
                        <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Stalk,</hi> also <hi>Descends;</hi> and so, according to the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of its Substance, becomes a shorter or longer <hi>Root;</hi> the Elder
or Lower Portion thereof, Rotting off, by the same Degrees with
the Generation of the Upper, out of the <hi>Stalk.</hi> So in <hi>Brownwort,</hi> the
<hi>Basis</hi> of the <hi>Stalk</hi> sinking down by degrees, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>till it lies under Ground,
becomes the upper part of the <hi>Root;</hi> and continuing still to sink,
the next year, becomes the lower Part; and the next after that, rots
away; a new Addition being still yearly made out of the <hi>Stalk,</hi> as
the elder Parts yearly rot away.<note place="margin">Tab. 5. f. 6, &amp; 7.</note> So in <hi>Dragon, Crocus,</hi> and the like,
where the <hi>Root</hi> is double; the <hi>Basis</hi> of the <hi>Stalk,</hi> this year; the next,
becomes the Upper-<hi>Root;</hi> after that, the Lower-<hi>Root;</hi> and at the
length dies and is consum'd.</p>
                     <p>14. §. The Demonstration hereof, is taken, more evidently, from
some <hi>Roots,</hi> than from others; as from the Level and Knobed <hi>Roots</hi>
of <hi>Wood-sorrel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 5. f. 1, &amp; 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Primrose,</hi> &amp;c. For the <hi>Leaves</hi> of those <hi>Plants</hi> rotting off
successively, and the <hi>Bases</hi> of those <hi>Leaves</hi> gradually descending into the
Ground; each <hi>Basis</hi> is thus nourished with a more copious <hi>Sap,</hi> and so
swelled into so many thick <hi>Knots.</hi> It may likewise be gather'd in
some, from the like Position of the <hi>Vessels</hi> or Woody Parts, in the <hi>Root,</hi>
as in the <hi>Trunk;</hi> as in <hi>Bares-foot,</hi> As also, from the <hi>Root</hi> of the <hi>Iris
Tuberosa:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 5. f. 4.</note> where, although the <hi>Leaves</hi> fall off close to the Surface of
the <hi>Stalk;</hi> yet after that is sunk down, and swell'd into a <hi>Root,</hi> the
<hi>Seats</hi> of the perished <hi>Leaves,</hi> and the Ends of the <hi>Vessels</hi> belonging to
them, are not obscurely visible; whereby the <hi>Root</hi> is wrought, as it
were, with several <hi>Seames</hi> and <hi>Prickt-Lines;</hi> the <hi>Seams</hi> shewing the
setting on of the <hi>Leaves;</hi> and the <hi>Pricks,</hi> the Terminations or broken
Ends of the <hi>Vessels:</hi> which ends, are still more apparent, upon the
stripping off the <hi>Barque.</hi> I considered likewise, That as among <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi>
there are many, which are not Bred of <hi>Eggs,</hi> immediately; but
are Transformed, one <hi>Animal</hi> into another: So, it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
That among <hi>Plants,</hi> there are not a few Instances of the like
<hi>Transformations;</hi> whereof, this is one.</p>
                     <p>15. §. The <hi>Cause</hi> of this <hi>Descent,</hi> so far as it is dependent on the
Inward Conformation of the <hi>Root,</hi> I shall shew in the following
<hi>Part.</hi> But the Immediate Visible one, are the <hi>String-Roots,</hi> which
this kind of <hi>Trunks</hi> frequently put forth: which, descending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
directly into the Ground, like so many <hi>Ropes,</hi> l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>g the <hi>Trunk</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them. Hence the <hi>Tuberous-Roots</hi> of <hi>Iris</hi> upon the rotting or fading
away of the <hi>String-Roots</hi> hanging at them, sometimes a little Re-ascend.
Hence also the <hi>Shape</hi> of some <hi>Roots</hi> is Inverted: For whereas most are
parted downwards, into several <hi>Legs;</hi> some are parted upwards into
divers <hi>Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ks,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 5. f. 5.</note> as <hi>Dandelyon,</hi> and others. For these <hi>Roots</hi> sending forth
at the top several <hi>Trunk-Buds,</hi> the said <hi>Buds</hi> successively put forth new,
and cast their old <hi>Leaves;</hi> and continually also making their Descent,
are at length formed into so many <hi>Necks,</hi> of three, four, five, or more
Inches long, under Ground.</p>
                     <p>16. §. HENCE ALso we understand, in what particular way,
some <hi>Roots</hi> become <hi>Perennial.</hi> Some are wholly so, as those of <hi>Trees,
Shrubs,</hi> and divers other woody <hi>Plants.</hi> Others, in part, or by a
new <hi>Progenies</hi> of <hi>Roots,</hi> from the old Head or Body, in the room of
those that die yearly, or after a certain Time; as of <hi>Lilium non bulbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100350:58"/>
Jerusalem Arti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>hoke, Potato, Dog-stones, Monks-hood, little Celan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi>
and others. In which <hi>Plants,</hi> one or more of their <hi>Roots</hi> are
firm, the other spongy and superannuated; and partly, by the ravine
of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> and other younger <hi>Roots,</hi> reduced to a Consumption and
Death.</p>
                     <p>17. §. With these, <hi>Tulips,</hi> and other <hi>Bulbous-Roots</hi> consort: For the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Rindes</hi> &amp; <hi>Shells,</hi> whereof chiefly, the <hi>Bulb</hi> consists, successively perish
and shrink up into so many thin and dry <hi>Skins:</hi> betwixt which, and in
their Centre, other <hi>Leaves</hi> and <hi>Shells,</hi> being successively formed, the
<hi>Bulb</hi> is thus perpetuated. In the same manner the <hi>String-Roots</hi> also suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
one another annually. So that at the end of divers Years, although
it be still looked upon as the same <hi>Individual Root,</hi> yet it is, in truth,
Another, as to every particle thereof.</p>
                     <p>18. §. Lastly, many other <hi>Roots</hi> are perpetuated by the aforesaid
Descent of the <hi>Trunk;</hi> out of which, it is still annually Repaired, as
by the gradual perishing of its lower parts, it is Diminished; as hath
been said.<note place="margin">Tab 5, f. 3.</note> Whence also we see the reason of the Rugged and Blunt
extremities of these, and some other <hi>Roots,</hi> as of that <hi>Plant</hi> superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
called <hi>Devils-bit:</hi> because the end of it seems to be bitten off.
Yet doth it not appear so originally; but the Lower part thereof rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off, as the Upper descends; the living remainder, becometh
stumped, or seemeth Bitten. Thus far of the <hi>Original, Shapes, Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and <hi>Ages</hi> of <hi>Roots.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> NEXT proceed to the several <hi>Parts</hi> whereof a
<hi>Root</hi> is Compounded. The outer <hi>Part</hi> of all is the
<hi>Skin;</hi> which is common to all <hi>Roots.</hi> 'Tis diversly
Coloured: Whiter in <hi>Skirrets;</hi> Yellow, in <hi>Dock;</hi>
Red, in <hi>Potato;</hi> Brown, in <hi>Lovage;</hi> Black, in <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloss.</hi>
Its Surface, sometimes Smooth, as in <hi>Hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radish;</hi>
Rough, as in <hi>Scorzonera.</hi> And the <hi>Skins</hi>
of the several <hi>Shells</hi> of a <hi>Tulip-Root,</hi> taken up fresh, look as if they
were perforated with a great many small holes. 'Tis of various Size;
very Thin, in <hi>Parsnep;</hi> somewhat Thick, in <hi>Bugloss;</hi> very Thick in <hi>Iris.</hi>
Sometimes it is Opacous, as in <hi>Thistle;</hi> and sometimes Transparent, as
in <hi>Madder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. Every <hi>Root</hi> hath successively two kinds of <hi>Skins:</hi> the one,
Coëtaneous with the other <hi>Parts;</hi> and hath its original from that
which involveth the <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Seed</hi> it self. The other, Postnate,
succeeding in the room of the former, as the <hi>Root</hi> ageth; and is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
from the <hi>Bark.</hi> So in <hi>Dandelyon,</hi> the old <hi>Skin,</hi> looked upon
about the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> seems to have been one of those several
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100350:59"/>
                        <hi>Rings,</hi> which the precedent year composed the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> of the
<hi>Root:</hi> but by the Generation of a new <hi>Ring,</hi> next the <hi>Wood,</hi> is now
thrust off and shrunk up into a <hi>Skin.</hi> So also in the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Bugloss</hi>
and <hi>Horse-Radish,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 14, 15.</note> as far as the <hi>Bladders</hi> in the former, and the <hi>Vessels</hi>
in the latter are Radiated; the <hi>Cortical Body</hi> seems either annually or
oftener, to shrink up into another new <hi>Skin,</hi> as, the old ones fall off.
And sometimes, perhaps, as in <hi>Assparagus,</hi> the whole body of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
<hi>Roots,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 10.</note> except the woody <hi>Fibre</hi> in the Centre, becomes the
second <hi>Skin.</hi> So that the wearing away of the old <hi>Skin,</hi> succeeds the
derivation of the new one; as in Descending <hi>Roots,</hi> the Consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Lower <hi>Parts,</hi> doth the Generation of the Upper. Because
the <hi>Barque</hi> swells, and grows sometimes faster than the <hi>Skin</hi> can fall
off, or give way to it: therefore are the <hi>Roots</hi> of many <hi>Herbs,</hi> Barque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
as well as the <hi>Trunks</hi> of <hi>Trees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. This <hi>Skin</hi> is usually, if not always, compounded of two
Kinds of Bodies: which also is probable of the Coëtaneous. The one,
<hi>Parenchymous,</hi> and frequently constructed of exceeding little <hi>Cells</hi> or
<hi>Bladders;</hi> which in some <hi>Roots,</hi> as of <hi>Asparagus,</hi> cut traverse, and
viewed through a <hi>Microscope,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 10.</note> are plainly visible. These <hi>Bladders</hi> are
of different Sizes;<note place="margin">Tab. 14.</note> in <hi>Buglos,</hi> larger; in <hi>Asparagus</hi> less; and sometimes
they coincide and disappear. But in these, and all other <hi>Roots,</hi>
even where these <hi>Bladders</hi> appear not, the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Skin,</hi>
is of the same Substantial <hi>Nature,</hi> with that other more vivid and bulky
one of the <hi>Bark:</hi> As is manifest, from its being thence Originated;
and alike Conformed, as shall be seen; and not only adjacent to it, as a
Glove is to the Hand; but continuous therewith, as the parts of a
piece of flesh, are one with another.</p>
                     <p>4. §. OF THIS <hi>Parenchymous Body,</hi> the <hi>Skin</hi> consisteth chiefly,
but not wholly; there being many <hi>Lignous Vessels</hi> which are Tubulary,
mixed therewith: which, though hardly by the <hi>Microscope,</hi> yet
otherwise, is demonstrable. For in tearing the <hi>Skin,</hi> you shall do it
more easily by the length, than bredth; because, by the first way, the
continuity only of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> is dissolved; but by the latter,
both of this, and of the <hi>Vessels,</hi> these being posited by the length of the
<hi>Root:</hi> So that, as by the smalness of the <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi>
the <hi>Skin</hi> is Dense; so by these <hi>Vessels,</hi> is it Tough.</p>
                     <p>5. §. Again, if you cut a <hi>Root</hi> traverse, and let it lie by for some
time, all the parts, where there are no <hi>Vessels,</hi> shrink below the surface of
the cut-end; but where-ever These are posited, there is no shrinking;
which oftentimes, evidently appears also in the <hi>Skin:</hi> because the said
<hi>Vessels,</hi> though, as the <hi>Bladders,</hi> they may coincide; yet they cannot
visibly shorten or shrink up in length; no more than a <hi>Straw,</hi> whose
sides may yet be easily crushed together.</p>
                     <p>6. §. Further, the <hi>Root</hi> being cut traverse, if, near the cut-end,
you very gently press the side of the <hi>Root</hi> with the edge of your Nail,
the <hi>Sap</hi> will thereupon arise sometimes from the <hi>Skin;</hi> in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as from any other part of the <hi>Root,</hi> where the like <hi>Vessels</hi> are posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And although the <hi>Sap</hi> may likewise be expressed from the <hi>Pith,</hi>
and other <hi>Parts</hi> where sometimes, there are none of these <hi>Vessels;</hi> yet
not without a solution of there continuity; which here doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
as appears, from the disappearing of the <hi>Sap,</hi> together with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100350:59"/>
of the pressure; the said <hi>Vessels</hi> then dilating themselves by
a Motion of <hi>Restitution,</hi> and so sucking up the <hi>Sap</hi> again.</p>
                     <p>7. §. Hereunto may be added the Testimony of sight; the very
<hi>Vessels</hi> themselves, in many <hi>Roots,</hi> coming under an apparent view, and
standing in the utmost surface of the <hi>Root</hi> all round about, as in that
of Liquirish, Columbine, Scorzonera, and others. Which <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
I have here, once for all, more particularly set down; because
I shall have occasion, hereafter, to refer to them.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>EXT WITHIN the <hi>Skin</hi> lieth the <hi>Barque.</hi>
'Tis sometimes Yellow, as in <hi>Dock;</hi> Red, in <hi>Bistort;</hi>
but usually, and in <hi>Seed-Roots,</hi> I think, always
White. It is derived from the <hi>Seed</hi> it self; being
but the extension or prolongation of the <hi>Parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
of the <hi>Radicle;</hi> One of the three <hi>Organical
Parts</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> described in the <hi>First Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of the <hi>First Book.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. § It is variously Sized; sometimes very Thin, as in <hi>Jerusalem
Artichoke, Goats-beard,</hi> and in most <hi>Trees;</hi> where it also retains the
Name of a <hi>Barque</hi> or <hi>Rind.</hi> Sometimes 'tis more Thick, and maketh up
the far greatest protion of the <hi>Root,</hi> as in the String-<hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Asparagus,</hi>
in <hi>Dandelion,</hi> and others. The thinnest and the thickest are all ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous,
and obtain the same general Uses. The degrees of its Size,
amongst all <hi>Roots,</hi> may be well reckoned about Twenty, and seen in
the following examples,<note place="margin">Tab. 7, 8, 9.</note> 
                        <hi>sc. Beet, Dropwort, Jerusalem Artichoke,
Orpine, Valerian, Goats-beard, Nettle, Brownwort, Columbine, Celan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,
Asparagus, Horse-Radish, Peony, Bryony, Eryngo, Borage, Lovage,
Dandelion, Parsnep, Carrot, &amp;c.</hi> In the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Beet,</hi> scarce exceeding
a good thick <hi>Skin:</hi> but in a <hi>Carrot,</hi> half the Semidiameter of the <hi>Root,</hi>
or above half an Inch over in some places: and that of <hi>Dandelion,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
in proportion with the <hi>woody Part,</hi> twice as thick: the rest of
Several intermediate Degrees: And to most <hi>Roots,</hi> this is common,
To have their <hi>Barque</hi> proportionably thicker, at the bottome than at
the top.</p>
                     <p>3. §. IT IS Compounded of two <hi>Bodies.</hi> The one <hi>Parenchymous;</hi>
Continuous throughout; yet somewhat Pliable without a solution of
its Continuity. Exceeding Porous; as appeareth from its so much
shrinking up, in drying. The <hi>Pores</hi> hereof are extended much alike
both by the length and bredth of the <hi>Root;</hi> therefore it shrinketh up,
by both those Dimensions, more equally. And they are very Dilative;
as is also manifest from its restorableness to its former bulk again, upon
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100350:60"/>
its infusion in Water: that is to say, <hi>It is a most curious and exquisitely
fine wrought Sponge.</hi> Thus much the Eye and Reason may discover.</p>
                     <p>4. §. The <hi>Microscope</hi> confirms the truth hereof, and more precisely
shews, That these <hi>Pores</hi> are all, in a manner, Spherical, in most <hi>Plants;</hi>
and this <hi>Part,</hi> an Infinite Mass of little <hi>Cells</hi> or <hi>Bladders.</hi> The sides of
none of them,<note place="margin">Tab. 10, &amp; sequent.</note> are Visibly pervious from one into another; but each is
bounded within it self. So that the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Barque,</hi> is much
the same thing, as to its Conformation, which the Froth of <hi>Beer</hi> or
<hi>Eggs</hi> is, as a fluid, or a piece of fine <hi>Manchet,</hi> as a fixed Body. The
Sides also of these <hi>Bladders</hi> are as transparent, as those of Water; or
the Bodies of some <hi>Insects.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. But their Size is usually much smaller; and their Posture more
Regular than those in <hi>Bread</hi> or <hi>Water.</hi> In all <hi>Roots</hi> they are so small,
as scarcely, without the <hi>Microscope,</hi> to be discerned: yet are they of
different Size, both in the same, and in divers <hi>Roots;</hi> the varieties
whereof, amongst all <hi>Roots,</hi> may be reduced to about Ten or Twelve
according to the <hi>Standard,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 13, 14.</note> in <hi>Tab.</hi> 11. Some of those in <hi>Dandelion,</hi>
being of the Smallest; and in <hi>Bugloss,</hi> of the Greatest. They are posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
for the most part, at an Equal Height; and piled evenly one over
another: So that, oftentimes, they visibly run in Ranks or trains,
both by the length and breadth of the <hi>Roots,</hi> as in the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Bugloss,</hi> or
of <hi>Dandelion,</hi> split through the middle, may be seen. Although they are
usually Spherical, yet sometimes, and in some places, they are more
oblonge,<note place="margin">Tab. 14.</note> as in the outward part of the <hi>Barque</hi> of <hi>Bugloss.</hi> These <hi>Bladders,</hi>
are sometimes best seen, after the <hi>Root,</hi> being cut traverse, hath layn
by a while, to dry.</p>
                     <p>6. §. They are the Receptacles of <hi>Liquor;</hi> which is ever Lucid;
and I think, always more Thin or Watery. They are, in all <hi>Seed-Roots,</hi>
filled herewith; and usually, in those also which are well
grown, as of <hi>Borage, Radish,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>7. §. THIS <hi>Parenchymous Part,</hi> in many <hi>Roots,</hi> is of one Uniform
<hi>Contexture;</hi> as in <hi>Asparagus, Hors-Radish, Peony, Potato,</hi> and others.
In many others, it is, as it were, of a Diversified <hi>Woof;</hi> the <hi>Bladders</hi>
being, though every where Regular, yet either in Shape, Size, or
Situation, different in some Parts hereof, from what they are, in other
intermediate ones. For these Parts, are like so many White <hi>Rays,</hi>
streaming, by the Diameter of the <hi>Root,</hi> from the inward Edge toward
the Circumference of the <hi>Barque;</hi> as in Lovage, Melilot, Parsnep, &amp;c.
cut transversly,<note place="margin">Tab. 8, 9.</note> is apparent. They are, though not in direct Lines,
continued also by the length of the <hi>Root;</hi> so that they are, as it were,
so many <hi>Membrances,</hi> by which the other Parts of the <hi>Barque,</hi> are dister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated.</p>
                     <p>8. §. The Continuation of these Diametral <hi>Rays,</hi> or <hi>Portions,</hi> is
divers: sometimes, but half through the <hi>Barque,</hi> or somewhat more,
or less,<note place="margin">Tab. 9.</note> as in <hi>Melilot.</hi> And it is probable, that to the <hi>Roots</hi> of all or
most <hi>Trefoyls,</hi> and also of the <hi>Leguminous</hi> Kind, this is proper, To have
their Diametral <hi>Rays</hi> come short of the Circumference. Sometimes,
they run quite through to the very <hi>Skin,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 8.</note> as in <hi>Lovage.</hi> And I think,
in the <hi>Roots</hi> of all Umbelliferous <hi>Plants:</hi> In which therefore, the <hi>Skin</hi>
seems to have a closer Communion with the Diametral <hi>Rays,</hi> and to be
originated especially therefrom. They usually stand at an Equal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in the same <hi>Root:</hi> But with respect to divers <hi>Roots,</hi> their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100350:60"/>
varies;<note place="margin">Tab. 7, 8.</note> so less, in <hi>Parsnep,</hi> greater in <hi>Bugloss.</hi> They are commonly
Rectilinear, as in <hi>Lovage;</hi> but sometimes winding to and fro, as in
a <hi>Carrot.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 8.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. They are not always of one Size: in a <hi>Carrot</hi> near the
Inner Edge of the <hi>Barque,</hi> exceeding Slender, and scarcely discerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
in others,<note place="margin">Tab. 8, 9.</note> Thicker, as in the Three greater ones of <hi>Melilot,</hi> and
in common <hi>Chervil.</hi> Both by their Distance, and Size, they are also
less or more Numerous; some, only as they are nearer; some, as smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler;
others, as both. And 'tis proper, I think, to the <hi>Intybous</hi> kind,
either to have none, or but a few. Sometimes they are of the same
Thickness quite through the <hi>Barque</hi> from edge to edge,<note place="margin">Tab. 7.</note> as in <hi>Marsh-Mallow.</hi>
And sometimes are considerably spread or dilated as they
aproach the <hi>Skin,</hi> wherewith they are joyned, and whereinto they
more visibly run, as in <hi>Parsley,</hi> or the smaller part of the <hi>Root</hi> of
<hi>Lovage.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 8.</note> And in some <hi>Roots,</hi> as of <hi>Scorzonera,</hi> at some times of the
year, when less succulent, almost the whole <hi>Parenchyma</hi> seems to be
of the Nature of the Diametral <hi>Rays,</hi> in other <hi>Roots.</hi> The <hi>Bladders</hi>
of these Diametral <hi>Portions,</hi> are sometimes, greater than those of the
other <hi>Parenchymous Parts,</hi> as in <hi>Parsley;</hi> and I think sometimes less.
Yet as there, so here, variously sized; to about six or eight De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
and those of <hi>Parsley</hi> about the third, fourth, and fifth. Their
Figure is Sometimes more oblong; and their direction or respect more
towards the Center of the <hi>Root.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. §. As the other <hi>Parenchymous Parts</hi> of the <hi>Barque,</hi> are the
Receptacles of <hi>Liquor;</hi> so these, (where they are) of <hi>Aer.</hi> This is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued,
From their being more White, and not Transparent, as such
<hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> use to be, which are more copiously and equally fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up with <hi>Liquor:</hi> as the <hi>Pith</hi> of <hi>Elder,</hi> which, in the old <hi>Stalks,</hi> is
White; was once, and by being well soaked, will become, again
Transparent. And from their being more dry and voyd of <hi>Liquor;</hi>
whereupon their <hi>Bladders,</hi> which cannot be Vacuities, must be filled
with more or less <hi>Aer,</hi> mixed with the <hi>Sap</hi> or the <hi>Vaporous</hi> parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
This is more observable in those Diametral <hi>Portions,</hi> which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
upon, and run into the <hi>Skin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. §. THE BARQUE is not only of a divers <hi>Woof,</hi> but as is
said, of a Compounded Substance; there being a certain number of
<hi>Lignous Vessels,</hi> fewer or more, in some place or other, mixed with
the <hi>Parenchymous Part</hi> above described; and some way or other, are
demonstrable in all <hi>Roots</hi> As by the Toughness of the <hi>Barque,</hi> when
pulled by the length. By the visible Continuation of the said <hi>Vessels</hi>
through the length of the <hi>Barque,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 6.</note> in the resemblance of small <hi>Threds.</hi>
And by the rising up of the <hi>Sap</hi> in the traverse cut of the <hi>Root,</hi> in
such places of the <hi>Barque,</hi> where these <hi>Threds</hi> terminate: as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
of the same <hi>Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Skin,</hi> was proved in the <hi>Precedent
Chapter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13. These Tubulary <hi>Threds,</hi> run not through the <hi>Barque</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
lines; but are frequently Braced together in the form of <hi>Net-Work;</hi>
The <hi>Parenchymous Parts</hi> every where filling up the spaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Braced <hi>Threds;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 6.</note> as in <hi>Burnet, Scorzonera,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Barque</hi>
being paired or striped off, is apparent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:100350:61"/>
14. §. They seem, at first, where they are Braced, to be Inos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated;
so as to be pervious one into another. But a more accurate
view, especially assisted by a <hi>Miscroscope,</hi> discovers the contrary. Neither
are they woun'd any way one about another, as Threds are in a Rope:
nor Implicated, as in ravled Yarn, or the Knots of a Net: but only
contiguous or simply Tangent, as the several Chords in the Braces of
a Drum: being thus joyned together by the <hi>Parenchymous Parts,</hi> as in
speaking of the <hi>Pith,</hi> will be understood how. Yet do not always the
same <hi>Threds</hi> belong and keep entire to one <hi>Brace;</hi> but are freqnently
parted into lesser <hi>Threds;</hi> which are transposed from <hi>Brace</hi> to <hi>Brace.</hi>
Nor do they always, in whole or in part, presently after their contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
mutually fall off again; but, oftentimes, run along collateral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
joyned together for some space.</p>
                     <p>15. §. These <hi>Braces</hi> are of various number in divers <hi>Roots;</hi> more
frequent in <hi>Jerusalem Artichoke,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 6.</note> less in <hi>Scorzonera,</hi> more rare in <hi>Cumfry.</hi>
The <hi>Threds</hi> likewise are variously Divaricated; sometimes more, where
the <hi>Braces</hi> are frequent, as in <hi>Jerusalem Artichoke;</hi> and sometimes less,
where the <hi>Braces</hi> are rare, as in <hi>Scorzonera, Dandelion:</hi> And in all
<hi>Roots,</hi> more frequent towards the Inner Verge of the <hi>Bark.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. §. By what is said, it is partly implied, That these <hi>Threds,</hi> are
not Single <hi>Vessels;</hi> but a <hi>Cluster</hi> of them, Twenty, Thirty, or more or
fewer of them together. Yet as the <hi>Threds</hi> are not Inosculated in the
<hi>Braces;</hi> so neither are the <hi>Vessels,</hi> in the <hi>Threds.</hi> Nor yet Twisted;
but only stand collateral together; as the several Single <hi>Threds</hi> of the
<hi>Silkworm,</hi> do in Sleave-Silk. Neither are these <hi>Vessels</hi> pyramidal, so far
as the <hi>Glass</hi> will discover; or, from probable Reason, may be conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured.
Nor Ramified, so as to be successively propagated one from
another, after the manner of the <hi>Veins</hi> in <hi>Animals:</hi> but Cylindrical,
and Distinctly continued, throughout the length of the <hi>Root;</hi> as the
several <hi>Fibres</hi> in a <hi>Tendon</hi> or <hi>Nerve.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>17. §. THESE VESSELS are either themselves of divers kinds, or
serve, at least, to constitute divers Kinds, in divers <hi>Roots:</hi> of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Natures whereof, although there may be other ways whereby to
judge; yet so far as by Inspection, we may do it, chiefly, by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of those <hi>Liquors,</hi> which they severally contain. Sometimes they
yield a <hi>Lympha;</hi> and that Thin, as they do in a <hi>Parsnep;</hi> especially
those that make a <hi>Ring,</hi> at the inward extremity of the <hi>Bark.</hi> See the
Root it self. That this Clear <hi>Sap</hi> ascendeth only from these <hi>Vessels,</hi> is
certain. Because no <hi>Liquor</hi> will do the like, from any <hi>Parenchymous
Part,</hi> as <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. hath been said. And because it is of a different
nature from the <hi>Sap</hi> contained in the <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
of the same <hi>Colour,</hi> yet sensibly more <hi>Sweet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>18. § Sometimes they yield a Thick and Mucilaginous <hi>Lympha,</hi> as
in <hi>Cumfry,</hi> as appeareth by its tenacity. From the Mucilaginous <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi>
of these <hi>Vessels</hi> it is, I suppose, that the <hi>Sap</hi> contained in the <hi>Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
is rendred of the like nature, so far as it approaches hereto, which
sometimes is more, as in <hi>Marsh-mallow;</hi> and sometimes but little as in
<hi>Borage:</hi> For in pressing out the <hi>Liquor</hi> of this <hi>Plant,</hi> and then heating
it over an indifferent fire; thefar greater part hereof remaineth thin;
only some certain strings and little bits of a gellied substance are mixed
herewith; which as it seems, were originally the proper <hi>Liquor</hi> of these
<hi>Muciducts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:100350:61"/>
19. §. Oftentimes these Succiferous <hi>Vessels</hi> yield a <hi>Milky</hi> or White
<hi>Sap;</hi> and sometimes Yellow, and of other colours as in <hi>Sonchus,</hi> and most
<hi>Cichoraceous Plants;</hi> in <hi>Angelica,</hi> and most <hi>Umbelliferous;</hi> in <hi>Burdock,</hi>
and divers <hi>Thistles,</hi> to which that is 'akin: in <hi>Scorzonera, Common
Bells,</hi> and many other <hi>Plants,</hi> not commonly taken notice of to be
<hi>milky.</hi> The <hi>Milky Saps</hi> of all which, although they differ in Colour,
Thickness, and other Qualities; yet agree, in being more <hi>Oyly</hi> than
any of the <hi>Lymphous Saps.</hi> It being the mixture of the <hi>Oyly</hi> parts with
some other Limpid <hi>Liquor,</hi> but of a different Nature, which causeth
them to be of a <hi>Milky,</hi> or other <hi>Opacous</hi> Colour, in the same manner
as common <hi>Oyl,</hi> and a strong <hi>Liquamen</hi> of Tartar, shaked in a Bottle
together, presently mix into a White <hi>Liquor.</hi> And although they
will, for the greatest part, separate again; yet some of their parts,
without any Boiling, or so much as the least Digestion with Heat, by
Agitation only, or standing together for some time, incorporate in the
form of a Thin <hi>Milky-Sope,</hi> which will also dissolve in <hi>Water.</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
therefore, That it is the <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> chiefly, of these <hi>Plants,</hi>
which being mixed with their <hi>Oyl,</hi> renders this <hi>Liquor</hi> of a White or
other Opacous Colour.</p>
                     <p>20. §. Sometimes the <hi>Oyl</hi> will separate and discover it self: for if
you cut a <hi>Fenil-Root</hi> traverse, after it hath layn some days out of the
Ground; the same <hi>Vessels,</hi> which, in a fresh <hi>Root,</hi> yields <hi>Milk;</hi> will
now, yield Oyl: the watery parts of the <hi>Milk,</hi> which in the dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Root</hi> are more evaporable, being spent.</p>
                     <p>21. §. All <hi>Gums</hi> and <hi>Balsams</hi> are likewise to be reputed the proper
<hi>Contents</hi> of these <hi>Vessels:</hi> for These and <hi>Milks,</hi> are very near akin.
So the <hi>Milk</hi> of <hi>Fenil,</hi> upon standing, turns to a Clear <hi>Balsam;</hi> of
<hi>Scorzonera, Dandelion,</hi> and others, to a <hi>Gum.</hi> In the dryed <hi>Root</hi>
of <hi>Angelica,</hi> &amp;c. being split, the <hi>Milk,</hi> according to the Continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of these <hi>Vessels,</hi> appeareth, as Blood clodders in the <hi>Veins,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densed
to an hard and shining <hi>Rosin.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 9.</note> And the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Helenium</hi> cut
transversely, presently yields a curious <hi>Balsame</hi> of a Citrine Colour,
and sometimes of the Colour of <hi>Balsame</hi> of <hi>Sulphur.</hi> I call it a <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same;</hi>
because it will not dissolve in Water. Yet not a <hi>Terebinth;</hi>
because, nothing near so viscid or tenaceous as that is. But the <hi>Root</hi>
of Common <hi>Wormwood,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 10. E.</note> bleeds, from large <hi>Vessels,</hi> a true <hi>Terebinth,</hi> or a
<hi>Balsame</hi> with all the defining properties of a <hi>Terebinth;</hi> although that
word be commonly used only for the Liquors of some <hi>Trees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>22. §. There is yet another kind of <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi> which may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Vapour-Vessels;</hi> as in <hi>Docks,</hi> at least some of them. For by the
<hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> it is, that the <hi>Barques</hi> of <hi>Roots</hi> do <hi>Bleed.</hi> Of which, some
Bleed quick and plentifully, as the <hi>Umbelliferous</hi> and the <hi>Cichoraceous</hi>
Kinds. Some, very slowly and scarce visibly, as all or most <hi>Trefoyls,</hi>
and of the <hi>Leguminous</hi> Kind. And some seem not to <hi>Bleed,</hi> as the
<hi>Dock.</hi> Yet that this <hi>Root,</hi> hath also <hi>Vessels</hi> distinct from those that
carry <hi>Aer;</hi> doth partly appear, from the different Colour they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
where they stand; as will better be understood anon, in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Causes of the <hi>Colours</hi> of <hi>Roots.</hi> As also from the Toughness
of the <hi>Barque,</hi> in pulling it by the length; neither the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi>
nor the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> being of themselves <hi>Tough.</hi> But because the <hi>Succu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi>
or <hi>Sap</hi> they carry, seems to be a kind of Dewy <hi>Vapour,</hi> therefore, they
may not improperly be called <hi>Roriferous</hi> or <hi>Vapour-Vessels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:100350:62"/>
23. §. THE <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi> are not only of divers Kinds, in divers
<hi>Roots,</hi> but in the same. Whether in all, I doubt: but in some it is
certain they are: For if you cut a <hi>Fenil-Root</hi> traverse, both <hi>Milk</hi> and
<hi>Limpid Sap,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 9.</note> will presently ascend, and, upon accurate inspection,
appear thereupon dinstinctly. So the <hi>Roots,</hi> both of <hi>Trachelium</hi> and
<hi>Enula,</hi> Bleed both a <hi>Lympha,</hi> and a Citrine <hi>Balsame:</hi> and <hi>Wormwood,</hi>
both a <hi>Lympha,</hi> and a <hi>Terebinth,</hi> at the same time. So also the <hi>Root</hi>
of <hi>Dandelion</hi> being cut in <hi>November,</hi> seems to bleed both a <hi>Milk</hi>
and a <hi>Lympha;</hi> the latter being drowned by the former at another
time when it is more copious. Whether all <hi>Roots</hi> have <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi>
is doubtful; but 'tis most probable, that they have, more or fewer;
standing, for the most part, in a <hi>Ring,</hi> at the Inner Verge of the
<hi>Barque:</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> whereof, I suppose, is so far of common Nature in
all <hi>Roots,</hi> as to be Clear, and less Oily.</p>
                     <p>24. §. THE Quantity of these <hi>Vessels</hi> is very different: In <hi>Borage,
Peony, Bistort,</hi> but few; in <hi>Asparagus,</hi> fewer: in <hi>Parsnep, Celandine,</hi>
many; in <hi>Fenil, Marsh-mallow,</hi> many more: and betwixt these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams,<note place="margin">Tab. 7, 8, 9.</note>
there are many Degrees, as by comparing the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Horse-Radish,
Turnep, Briony, Skirrets, Parsley, Goats-Beard,</hi> and as many
more as you please, may be seen. Amongst the several Sorts of <hi>Docks,</hi>
they seem in <hi>Patience,</hi> to be the fewest; in <hi>Red-Dock,</hi> the most nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous.
There are two ways of judging of their Number; Either
as their Extremeties are visible upon the traverse cut of the <hi>Barque;</hi>
or as the <hi>Barque</hi> is diversly Brittle or Tough; being so, from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Number of these <hi>Vessels</hi> therein, as in the <hi>Second Chapter</hi> hath
been said.</p>
                     <p>25. §. The Quantity of the ascending <hi>Sap,</hi> is a doubtful argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whether of the Number, or Size of these <hi>Vessels.</hi> For it is
common to most <hi>Milky-Roots,</hi> for the <hi>Milk</hi> to ascend more copiously:
yet in some of them, the <hi>Vessels</hi> seem, in proportion with the <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymous
Part,</hi> not to be so numerous, as in some other <hi>Roots,</hi> where
the ascending <hi>Sap</hi> is less; as by comparing the <hi>Lacteals</hi> of <hi>Dandelion,</hi>
and the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> of <hi>Fenil</hi> together, may appear: so that it should
seem, that the bore of the <hi>Lacteal Vessels,</hi> is greater than that of the
<hi>Lymphaeducts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>26. §. THE Situation of these <hi>Vessels,</hi> as they appear, even to
the naked Eye, in the transverse Section, is Various and Elegant.
Sometimes they are posited only at the Inner Edg of the <hi>Barque,</hi> where
they make a Ring,<note place="margin">Tab. 7, 8, 9, &amp; 10.</note> as in <hi>Asparagus.</hi> In which place and position, they
stand in most, if not in all, <hi>Roots,</hi> how variouslly soever they are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
also otherwise. The Common <hi>Crow-Foot</hi> with numerous <hi>Roots,</hi>
hath a <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> next the <hi>Skin.</hi> So the <hi>Barque</hi> of <hi>Monks-Hood,</hi>
is encompassed with a transparent <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Sap-Vessels.</hi> The
<hi>Ring</hi> is either more Entire, as in <hi>Eryngo, Brown-Wort, Valerian, Hop,
Madder, &amp;c.</hi> Or it is a Prick'd <hi>Ring,</hi> as in <hi>Buttyr-Bur.</hi> Sometimes
they are chiefly postur'd in a Prick-Ring, towards the outward part of
the <hi>Barque,</hi> as in <hi>Peony:</hi> and some <hi>Roots</hi> are pricked all over the
<hi>Barque,</hi> as of <hi>Melilot.</hi> In others, they stand not so much in Pricks,
as Portions or <hi>Colums,</hi> as in <hi>Cumfry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:100350:62"/>
27. §. In others, again, they all stand in more continued Lines,
either Rays or Diametral, as in <hi>Borage;</hi> or Peripherial, as in <hi>Celan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine.</hi>
The <hi>Vascular</hi> Rays are not equally extended in all <hi>Roots:</hi> in
<hi>Parsnep,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 7, 8, 9.</note> towards the Circumference of the <hi>Barque;</hi> in <hi>Bugloss,</hi> about
half way. In all <hi>Docks,</hi> and <hi>Sorrels,</hi> the <hi>Rays</hi> are extended through
about ¾ of the thickness of the <hi>Barque,</hi> towards the Circumference,
whereabout, divers of them are always <hi>arched</hi> in, two and two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In all or many <hi>Trefoyls,</hi> and of the <hi>Leguminous</hi> Kind, they are
extended through no more than ⅓<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of the <hi>Barque.</hi> In the <hi>Umbellife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi>
they are Ralled in betwixt the Diametral <hi>Portions</hi> of the <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma.</hi>
In <hi>Borage,</hi> the Rays are more Continuous; in a <hi>Carrot,</hi> more
Pricked. Here also the Pricks stand in Even Lines; in <hi>Lovage,</hi> they
are Divaricated. Of which, and those of some other <hi>Roots,</hi> it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
Observable, That they are not all meer Pricks, but most of them
small,<note place="margin">Tab. 8.</note> yet real Circles; which, after the <hi>Milk</hi> hath been frequently
licked off, and ceaseth to ascend, are visible, even without a <hi>Glass.</hi>
And note, that in observing all <hi>Milk-Vessels,</hi> the <hi>Milk</hi> is to be taken off,
not with the Finger but the Tongue; so often, till it riseth no more,
or but little. And some <hi>Roots</hi> may also be soaked in Water; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Position of the <hi>Milk-Vessels,</hi> will be visible by the darker Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the <hi>Barque,</hi> where they stand.</p>
                     <p>28. §. The Rays sometimes, run more Parallel, and keep several,
as in <hi>Monkshood;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 7, 8, 9.</note> and sometimes, towards the Circumference of the
<hi>Barque,</hi> they are occurrent; as not only in <hi>Docks,</hi> but other <hi>Plants:</hi>
In <hi>Eryngo,</hi> in a termination more Circular; and in <hi>Bryony,</hi> angular,
or in the form of a <hi>Glory,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 15.</note> as also in <hi>Horsradish,</hi> through a <hi>Microscope.</hi>
The Peripherial Lines are in some, more entire Circles, as in <hi>Dandelion;</hi>
in others, made up of shorter Chords, as in <hi>Potato, Cumfry,</hi> and the
smaller part of the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Monks-hood.</hi> In some, the Pricks are so
exceeding small, and stand so close, that, to the bare eye, they seem
to be continous <hi>Rings,</hi> which yet, through the <hi>Microscope,</hi> appear
distinct,<note place="margin">Tab. 12.</note> as in <hi>Marsh-mallow</hi> and <hi>Liquirish.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>29. §. Sometimes Columns and Chords are compounded, as in
<hi>Burnet;</hi> Pricks and Chords, in <hi>Potato;</hi> Rays and Rings, in <hi>Monk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood;</hi>
where the Ring is Single. In <hi>Fenil,</hi> there is a double or treple
order both of Rays and Rings, the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> standing in Rays and
the <hi>Lacteals</hi> in Rings. And in <hi>Marsh-mallow,</hi> the <hi>Vessels</hi> are so posited
as to make both those kinds of Lines at once.</p>
                     <p>30. §. In <hi>Celandine,</hi> they seem all, to the bare eye, to stand in
numerous Rings lying even one within another. As also in <hi>Dandelion;</hi>
in which yet,<note place="margin">Tab. 13.</note> being viewed through a <hi>Microscope,</hi> there is an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of very many small Rays; which streaming from the Inner Verge
of the <hi>Barque,</hi> cross three or four of the smaller Rings, and are there
terminated. Whence it should seem that <hi>Lymphatick</hi> Rays and <hi>Milky</hi>
Rings, are in that <hi>Root,</hi> so far mixed together. Only the <hi>Lympha,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
confounded with the <hi>Milk,</hi> cannot be discerned. And where the
<hi>Milky-Vessels</hi> are evacuated, or at such Seasons, wherein they are less
full, divers <hi>Milky Roots</hi> will yield a clear <hi>Liquor</hi> at the Inner Verge of
the <hi>Barque,</hi> where, at other times they seem to yield only <hi>Milk.</hi>
And this is the Description of the <hi>Barque.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT Portion of the <hi>Root</hi> which standeth next
within the <hi>Barque,</hi> and in <hi>Trees,</hi> and <hi>Shrubby
Plants,</hi> is the <hi>Wood;</hi> is also compounded of
Two Substantially different Bodies, <hi>Parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi>
and <hi>Lignous.</hi> The <hi>Parenchymous,</hi> is of
the same Substantial Nature with that of the
<hi>Barque.</hi> And is originated from it; being not
only adjacent to it, but all round about conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
therewith; even as that, is with the
<hi>Skin;</hi> the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Barque,</hi> being distributed, from time to
time, partly outward into the <hi>Skin,</hi> and partly inward, into the
<hi>Wood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. The Position of the several parts hereof, is different. For the
most part it hath a Diametral Continuation, in several Portions, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
betwixt as many more of the <hi>Lignous,</hi> from the Circumference
towards the Center of the <hi>Root:</hi> all together, constituting that, which
in the <hi>Second Chapter</hi> of the <hi>First Book,</hi> I call the <hi>Insertment.</hi> In the
<hi>Roots</hi> of many <hi>Herbs,</hi> these Diametral or Inserted Portions are more
observable, as in <hi>Cumfry;</hi> which leadeth to the notice of them in all
others,<note place="margin">Tab. 9.</note> both of <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Trees.</hi> Sometimes part of this <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymous</hi>
Body is disposed into <hi>Rings,</hi> as in <hi>Fenil.</hi> The Number and Size
of which Rings differ: In <hi>Fenil,</hi> when the <hi>Root</hi> is grown large, they
are in some places broader,<note place="margin">Tab. 8, 9.</note> but fewer; in <hi>Beet</hi> they are narrower, but
more. The Diametral Portions are here, in like manner, much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried;
in <hi>Cumfry, Celandine,</hi> larger; in <hi>Beet, Bugloss,</hi> meaner; in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
Parsnep,</hi> more, and smaller; and in most Woody-<hi>Roots,</hi> stream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
betwixt the <hi>Pith</hi> and the <hi>Barque,</hi> as so many small Rays. Their
Continuation is also different; in some <hi>Roots,</hi> to the Centre, as in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbine;</hi>
in others not, as in <hi>Parsnep.</hi> And sometimes different in the
same <hi>Root,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 17.</note> as in the <hi>Vine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. The Contexture of these <hi>Parenchymous</hi> Portions is sometimes
Uniform, as in <hi>Bugloss, Peony;</hi> and sometimes also, as it is in the
<hi>Barque,</hi> different; in part, more sappy, and transparent; in part,
more white, dry, and aery, as in <hi>Carrot, Lovage, Scorzonera,</hi> and
others; which yet cannot be observed without a wary view. But
their general Texture is the same being all made up of many small <hi>Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
Which are here of different Sizes, like those of the <hi>Barque,</hi> but
for the most part smaller. Their Shape likewise, is usually Round;
but sometimes Oblong and Oval, as in <hi>Borage;</hi> or Oblong and Square,
as in the <hi>Vine.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 17.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. The <hi>Lignous Part,</hi> if not always, yet usually, is also Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of Two Kinds of <hi>Bodies, scil. Succiferous</hi> or <hi>Lignous</hi> and <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi>
The <hi>Lignous</hi> as far as discernable, are of the same Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and Nature with those of the <hi>Barque,</hi> and in the transverse cut
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100350:63"/>
of the <hi>Root,</hi> do oftentimes, as those, emit a <hi>Liquour.</hi> They are also
Braced; and many of them run in distinct <hi>Threds</hi> or Portions, collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
together.</p>
                     <p>5. §. The <hi>Aer Vessels</hi> I so call, because they contain no <hi>Liquor,</hi> bnt
an <hi>Aery Vapour.</hi> They are, more or less, visible in all <hi>Roots.</hi> They may
be distinguished, to the bare Eye, from the <hi>Parenchymous Parts,</hi> by their
Whiter Surface; and their standing more prominent, wheras those
shrink below the transverse level of the <hi>Root,</hi> upon drying. They are
frequently Conjugated divers of them together,<note place="margin">Tab. 10, &amp; 15.</note> sometimes fewer, and
for the most part single, as in <hi>Asparagus;</hi> sometimes many, as in <hi>Hors-Radish.</hi>
And their Conjugations are also Braced, as the Threds of the
<hi>Succiferous Vessels.</hi> But they are no where Inosculated: nor Twisted
one about another; but only Tangent or Collateral. Neither are they
Ramified, the greater into less; but are all distinctly continued, as
the <hi>Nerves</hi> in <hi>Animals,</hi> from one end of the <hi>Root</hi> to the other.</p>
                     <p>6. §. Their Braces, as those of the <hi>Succiferous Vessels,</hi> are also of
various number: in <hi>Jerusalem Artichoke, Cumfry, Scorzonera,</hi> more rare;
in <hi>Borage, Burnet,</hi> more frequent; as by stripping off the <hi>Barque</hi> of
such <hi>Roots,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 6.</note> where it is easily separable, may be seen. And they often
vary in the same <hi>Root;</hi> so in <hi>Borage, Scorzonera,</hi> &amp;c. they are more
frequent in the Centre, and next the <hi>Barque,</hi> than in the Intermediate
space,<note place="margin">Tab. 6.</note> as by splitting those <hi>Roots</hi> down the middle doth appear. They
also vary from those of the <hi>Succiferous Vessels;</hi> those being usually more
frequent, as in <hi>Jerusalem Artichoke,</hi> than these of the <hi>Aerial.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. Betwixt these Braced <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> and the rest, which make
the true <hi>Wood,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 6.</note> run the <hi>Parenchymous Parts</hi> above described; as they
do betwixt the <hi>Succiferous</hi> in the <hi>Barque:</hi> and so make up two Pieces
of <hi>Net Work,</hi> wherof one is the filling up of the other.</p>
                     <p>8. §. The Position of both these Kinds of <hi>Vessels,</hi> is Various. The
<hi>Succiferous</hi> or <hi>Lignous,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 17.</note> are sometimes posited in diametral lines or porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
as in the <hi>Vine,</hi> and most <hi>Trees.</hi> Sometimes, oppositely to the
<hi>Aerial,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 8.</note> as in <hi>Beet;</hi> each Ring herein being double, and made both of
<hi>Sap</hi>-and <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. In <hi>Nettle</hi> the Position is very peculiar,<note place="margin">Tab. 8.</note> from what it is in the
<hi>Roots</hi> of other <hi>Herbs;</hi> being curiously mixed; the <hi>Succiferous</hi> running
cross the <hi>Aerial,</hi> in several, <hi>viz. Five, Six, Seven,</hi> or more <hi>Rings.</hi>
In <hi>Bryony</hi> the several Conjugations of the <hi>Aerial,</hi> are distinctly sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with the <hi>Succiferous.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 7.</note> In <hi>Patience,</hi> the <hi>Succiferous</hi> are disposed,
besides Rays, into many small Rings, of different Sizes, sprinkled up
and down, and not, as in other <hi>Roots</hi> having one common Centre;
within divers whereof, the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are included: especially within
those which are drawn, not into <hi>Rings,</hi> but, as it were, into little
stragling <hi>Hedges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. §. That also of the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> is Various and Elegant: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the upper part of the <hi>Root.</hi> In <hi>Ammi, Lilium-non-bulbosom,</hi>
they make a Ring. In these, a Prick'd-Ring; in <hi>Peony,</hi> a Ring of
Rays;<note place="margin">Tab. 7, 8, 9.</note> in <hi>Valerian,</hi> a Ring of Pricks and Rays. In others, they make
not Rings, but longer Rays, extended either towards the Centre,
as in <hi>Scorzenera;</hi> or meeting in it, as in <hi>Columbine.</hi> In the Common
<hi>Dock,</hi> they stand more in single Rays: in the other <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Docks,</hi>
both in Rays, and collateral Conjugations between.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:100350:64"/>
11. §. In <hi>Beet,</hi> they stand in several Rings; and every Ring,
made of Rays. In <hi>Cumfry,</hi> the Rays and Rings are separate; those
stand without,<note place="margin">Tab. 8, 9.</note> these next the Centre. In <hi>Dandelion,</hi> they stand alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and make a little Rope, in the Center it self. In <hi>Geranium,</hi>
and others of that Kindred, they make a little Thred, in the same
place. And in <hi>Skirret,</hi> they stand in two Threds, near the Centre.</p>
                     <p>12. §. In <hi>Celandine,</hi> they stand in almost parallel Lines. In
<hi>Monks-hood,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 8, 9.</note> of a wedged Figure; divided in the smaller part of the
<hi>Root,</hi> into Three little Wedges, with their poynts meeting exactly
in the Centre. In <hi>Cinquefoyle,</hi> and <hi>Strawberry,</hi> they are also postur'd
in three Conjugations, triangularly. In the young <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Oak,</hi>
they stand neither in Radiated, nor otherwise strait, but Winding
Lines. And in <hi>Borage</hi> the position, of many of them, is Spiral. As
likewise, sometimes, in <hi>Mercury,</hi> or <hi>Lapathum unctuosum.</hi> In <hi>Horse-Radish,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 15.</note>
they stand more confused neither in Rings nor in Rays; yet
their several Conjugations, are radiated: with very many other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
                     <p>13. §. The Quantity of these <hi>Vessels,</hi> as to the space they take up
in the <hi>Root,</hi> is to be computed Two ways, By their Number, and
Size. Their Number may, in some <hi>Roots,</hi> and in some measure, be
judged of, by the bare Eye; having, frequently, a whiter surface
than the other <hi>Parts.</hi> As also their Size; the Bore of these <hi>Vessels</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
greater than that of the <hi>Lignous</hi> in all <hi>Roots;</hi> especially in some.
For if you take the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Vine, Fenil, Dandelion, Plum-tree, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Willow,</hi> &amp;c. and lay them by, for some time, to dry; and then,
having cut off a very thin Slice of each, transversely; if you hold up
those Slices before your Eye, so as the Light may be trajected through
the said <hi>Vessels,</hi> they hereby become visible, as notably different, both
in Number and Size.</p>
                     <p>14. §. But undeceitful and accurate Observation of both their
Number, and Size, must be made by the <hi>Microscope;</hi> and so they will
appear to be much more various. In <hi>Bistort, Skirret,</hi> they are very
few; in <hi>Beet,</hi> very many: betwixt which extreams there are all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
as in <hi>Orpine, Venus Looking-Glass, Scorzonera,</hi> Great <hi>Celandine,
Peony, Borag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>, Fenil,</hi> &amp;c. may be seen. So their Size, in some is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
small, as in <hi>Strawberry, Bistort, Valerian;</hi> in others very great,
as in <hi>Asparagus, Bugloss, Vine.</hi> They are also of several Sizes in one
and the same Numerical <hi>Root;</hi> but in some, are less varied, as in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium

being of the greatest Size; appearing through a good <hi>Glass,</hi> at least
one Third of an Inch in Diametre: those in <hi>Strawberry,</hi> and that
Kind, of the smallest; most of them appearing, in the same <hi>Glass,</hi>

Artichoke;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 11, 14, 15, 17.</note> in others Small, but Many, as in <hi>Horse-Radish:</hi> in <hi>Bugloss,</hi>
they are Great, but Few; in the <hi>Vine,</hi> Great and Many. So that the
proportion, which those of a <hi>Vine,</hi> their Number and Size being taken
together, bear to those of <hi>Jerusalem Artichoke,</hi> may be, at least, as Fifty,
to One. Of the smallest Kinds, as those of <hi>Cinquefoyl, Jerusalem Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choke,</hi>
and the like; It is to be noted, That they are scarce ever visible
in the fresh Slices of these <hi>Roots;</hi> but after they have layn by a while, at
last, by a good <hi>Glass,</hi> Clear Light, and steddy View, are discerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>16. §. In some <hi>Roots,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 13, 15.</note> the greater of these <hi>Vessels</hi> stand in or next
the Centre, as in <hi>Taraxacum,</hi> or <hi>Dandelion;</hi> in others next the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
as in <hi>Horse-Radish.</hi> Sometimes each of them is from one end of
the <hi>Root</hi> to the other, of a more equal Size, or more Cylindrical, as in
<hi>Marsh-mallow;</hi> but usually, they widen, more or less, from the Top,
to the Bottom of the <hi>Root,</hi> as in <hi>Thorn-Apple:</hi> about the Top of which,
they are, for the most part, but of the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth,
Magnitude; some of the Fifth, but none of the Third; but about the
Bottome, they are most of the Third, and Fifth: whence it is manifest,
That some of them are, in the manner of <hi>Veins,</hi> somewhat Pyramidal.
Yet is it observable, That their ampliation proceedeth not towards, but
from their Original, as in <hi>Nerves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>17. §. <hi>Of these</hi> Vessels <hi>Seignior</hi> Malpighi <hi>hath observed;</hi> Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntur
<hi>(saith he)</hi> expositae fistulae Zona tenui &amp; pellucida, velut argentei
coloris lamina, parum lata; quae, spiraliter locata, &amp; extremis lateribus
unita, Tubum, interius &amp; exterius aliquantulum asperum, efficit.</p>
                     <p>18. §. To whose Observation I further add, That the <hi>Spiral
Zone,</hi> or <hi>Lamina,</hi> as he calls it, is not ever one Single <hi>Piece;</hi> but consisteth
of Two or More round and true <hi>Fibres,</hi> although standing collaterally
together, yet perfectly distinct. Neither are these Single <hi>Fibres</hi>
themselves <hi>flat,</hi> like a <hi>Zone;</hi> but of a <hi>round</hi> forme, like a most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ine
<hi>Thred.</hi> According as fewer or more of these <hi>Fibres</hi> happen to break off,
from their Spiral location, together; the <hi>Zone</hi> is narrower, or broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
usually, Narrower in the <hi>Trunk,</hi> and Broader in the <hi>Root.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>19. §. Of these <hi>Fibres</hi> I also Observe, That they are not <hi>Inosculated</hi>
side to side, but are <hi>Knit</hi> together by other smaller <hi>Fibres;</hi> those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as it were, the <hi>Warp,</hi> and these the <hi>Woof</hi> of the <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi> Yet
I think the several <hi>Fibres</hi> are not interwoven just as in a <hi>Web;</hi> but by
a kind of Stitch, as the several <hi>Plates</hi> or <hi>Bredths</hi> of a Floor-Mat. A
clear and elegant sight of these <hi>Fibres,</hi> and of their <hi>Interwestage,</hi> by
splitting a <hi>Vine-Root,</hi> or a piece of <hi>Oak,</hi> may, with a good <hi>Glass</hi> in the
sides of their Greater <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> be obtained; having much of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
of <hi>Close Needle-work.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>20. §. The Spiration of the <hi>Fibres</hi> of these <hi>Vessels,</hi> may more easily
be observed in the <hi>Trunk,</hi> than in the <hi>Root.</hi> And better in younger
<hi>Plants,</hi> than other. And not so well by Cutting as by Splitting, or by
Tearing off some small Piece, through which they <hi>run:</hi> their Conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being, by this means, not spoiled. Yet this way, the <hi>Vessels</hi> are
seen, chiefly, <hi>Unresolved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>21. §. But in the <hi>Leaves</hi> and Tender <hi>Stalks</hi> of all such <hi>Plants,</hi> as
shew, upon breaking, a kind of <hi>Doune</hi> or <hi>Wool;</hi> they may be seen
<hi>Resolved</hi> and Drawn out, and that some times even to the naked Eye,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100350:65"/>
an Inch or two Inches in length. This <hi>Wool</hi> being nothing else, but a
certain number of <hi>Fibres</hi> Resolved from their Spiral position in these
<hi>Vessels,</hi> and Drawn out in Length; and so clustred together, as so many
<hi>Threds</hi> or little <hi>Ropes:</hi> appearing thus more or less, in the <hi>Leaves</hi> and
some other <hi>Parts</hi> of most <hi>Plants;</hi> but more remarquably in some, as
in the <hi>Vine, Scabious,</hi> and others. As also in the Scales of a <hi>Squill.</hi> In
which last, for example, they are so easily separable, as further to
shew, what before was observed; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Plate</hi> or <hi>Zone,</hi> into
which the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are usually Resolved, is not one Single Piece, or
meer <hi>Plate;</hi> but made up of several Round <hi>Fibres,</hi> all standing and
running parallel, and so knit together by other smaller ones, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly,
in the form of a <hi>Zone.</hi> For if you break or cut a <hi>Leaf</hi> or <hi>Shell</hi>
of a fresh <hi>Squill,</hi> till you come to the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> and having softly
drawn them out, for about an Inch or more (to the naked Eye) in
length, you then single out one or two of them from the rest, and
rowl them, as they hang at the <hi>Shell,</hi> eight or nine times round, each
<hi>Vessel</hi> will appear, through a <hi>Glass,</hi> to consist of 8, 10, or 12 small
<hi>Fibres;</hi> which, in the Unresolved <hi>Vessel,</hi> run parallel; but by this
means, are all separated one from another. See the <hi>Figures</hi> belonging
to the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Fourth Books.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>22. §. The Process of their Spiration, is not, so far as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
accidental, but constantly the same; <hi>scil.</hi> In the <hi>Root,</hi> by
<hi>South,</hi> from <hi>West</hi> to <hi>East:</hi> But in the <hi>Trunk,</hi> contrarily, by <hi>South,</hi>
from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>23. §. The <hi>Content</hi> of these <hi>Vessels,</hi> is, as hath already been inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,
more <hi>Aery.</hi> The Arguments for which, are, That upon a
transverse Cut of the <hi>Root,</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> ascendeth not there, where
These stand. Being also viewed through a <hi>Microscope,</hi> they are never
observed to be filled with <hi>Liquor.</hi> Besides a <hi>Root</hi> cut and immersed in
Water, till the Water is in some part got into these <hi>Vessels,</hi> and then
the <hi>Root</hi> taken out and crushed; the other <hi>Parts</hi> will yield <hi>Liquor,</hi>
but These, only <hi>Bubbles:</hi> which <hi>Bubbles</hi> are made, by some small
quantity of <hi>Liquor</hi> mixed with the <hi>Aer,</hi> before contained in the said
<hi>Vessels.</hi> To which, other Arguments will arise out of those Things
that follow in the <hi>Second Part.</hi> As also for this <hi>Content,</hi> its not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a pure or simple, but <hi>Vaporous Aer.</hi> Whether these <hi>Vessels</hi> may
not, in some <hi>Vegetables,</hi> and at some times, contain <hi>Liquor,</hi> is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.

the like. See the <hi>Roots.</hi> And in many others there

from the top to the bottom, as in <hi>Beet, Fenil,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>2. §. The Size of the <hi>Pith</hi> is varied by many Degrees, easily rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
an Hundred; in <hi>Fenil, Dandelion, Asparagus,</hi> but small; in
<hi>Horse-Radish, Valerian, Bistort,</hi> great. The Shape hereof, in the
lower parts of most <hi>Roots,</hi> is <hi>Pyramidal;</hi> but at the tops, Various, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the different Distribution of the <hi>Vessels,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 6.</note> as in <hi>Carrot, Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolick,</hi>
in <hi>Parsley, Oval;</hi> as appeareth, in cutting the <hi>Roots</hi> lenght-ways.</p>
                     <p>3. §. The <hi>Pith,</hi> for the most part, especially in <hi>Trees,</hi> is a <hi>Simple</hi> Body:
but sometimes, it is, as the <hi>Barque,</hi> compounded; some certain number
of <hi>Succiserous Vessels</hi> being mixed herewith;<note place="margin">Tab. 6, &amp; 8.</note> as in <hi>Jerusalem Artichoke,
Horse-Radish,</hi> &amp;c. upon a traverse cut, by a strict view, may be
discerned. Their Position is sometimes Confused, as in a <hi>Carrot;</hi> and
sometimes Regular,<note place="margin">Tab. 6.</note> as in <hi>Parsley;</hi> appearing, by the traverse cut, in
Rings, and in cutting by the length, in Arches. And sometimes the
<hi>Pith</hi> is hollow; as in the <hi>Level-Roots</hi> of <hi>Bishops-Weed:</hi> these <hi>Roots</hi>
being made out of the <hi>Stalk,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">§. 13, 14, 15.</note> as in the <hi>First Chapter</hi> hath been shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
how.</p>
                     <p>4. §. As all the other Parts of the <hi>Root,</hi> are originated from the
<hi>Seed;</hi> so, sometimes, is the <hi>Pith</hi> it self. But sometimes, it hath its
more immediate Derivation from the <hi>Barque.</hi> Hence it is, that many
<hi>Roots,</hi> which have no <hi>Pith</hi> in their lower parts, have one at their
top,<note place="margin">Tab. 4.</note> as <hi>Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>mbine, Lovage,</hi> &amp;c. For the <hi>Parenchymous Parts</hi> of the
<hi>Barque</hi> being, by degrees, distributed into Diametral <hi>Portions,</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
betwixt those of the <hi>Lignous Body,</hi> and at length, meeting and
uniting in the Centre, they thus constitute the <hi>Pith.</hi> In the same
manner, at the top of some <hi>Roots,</hi> the <hi>Pith</hi> is either made or augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
out of the <hi>Parenchymous Rings</hi> above described; these being
gradually distributed to, and embodied in the Centre; as in <hi>Fenil,</hi> and
some other <hi>Roots,</hi> their lower and upper parts compared together,
may be seen. Even as in <hi>Animals,</hi> one <hi>Part,</hi> as the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> is
the original of divers others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:100350:66"/>
5. §. From hence, it also appears, That the <hi>Pith</hi> is of the same
Substantial Nature with the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Barque,</hi> and with the
Diametral <hi>Portions;</hi> and that therefore they are all one body, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in no Essential Property, but only in their Shape and Place. The
same is also evident from the Continuity of the <hi>Pith</hi> with the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
<hi>Portions,</hi> as of These, with the said <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> And from
their Contexture, which, by a <hi>Microscope,</hi> appeareth to be of one
and the same general kind, in all <hi>Plants,</hi> both in the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of
the <hi>Barque,</hi> in the <hi>Insertment</hi> or Diametral <hi>Portions,</hi> and in the <hi>Pith,</hi>
all being made up of <hi>Bladders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. § The <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Pith,</hi> are of very different Sizes; sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
less,<note place="margin">Tab. 9, &amp; 15.</note> than in the <hi>Barque,</hi> as in <hi>Asparagus;</hi> usually much bigger,
as in <hi>Horse-Radish.</hi> They may be well reckoned to about fifteen or
twenty degrees; those in <hi>Jerusalem Artichoke,</hi> of the largest; in <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerian,
Horse-Radish,</hi> of the meaner; in <hi>Bistort, Peony,</hi> of the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest.
Their Position is rarely varied, as it is oftentimes, in the <hi>Barque;</hi>
but more uniform, and in the transverse Cut, equally respective to all
parrs of the <hi>Root:</hi> yet being piled evenly, one over another, in the
long cut, they seem to run, in Direct Trains, by the length of the
<hi>Root.</hi> Their Shape also is, usually more orbicular; but sometimes,
somewhat angular,<note place="margin">Tab. 11.</note> in the larger kinds, as in <hi>Jerusalem Artichoke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. THUS FAR the Contexture of the <hi>Pith</hi> is well discoverable
in the <hi>Root.</hi> In the <hi>Trunk,</hi> farther, and more easily. Whereof
therefore, in the next <hi>Book,</hi> I shall give a more particular <hi>Description</hi>
and <hi>Draught.</hi> Yet since I am speaking of it, I shall not wholly omit
here to observe, That the <hi>Sides,</hi> by which the aforesaid <hi>Bladders</hi> of
the <hi>Pith</hi> are circumscribed, are not meer <hi>Paper-Skins,</hi> or rude <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes;</hi>
but so many several Ranks or Piles of exceeding small <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous
Threds;</hi> lying, for the most part, evenly one over another,
from the bottom to the top of every <hi>Bladder;</hi> and running cross,
as the <hi>Threds</hi> in the Weavers <hi>Warp,</hi> from one <hi>Bladder</hi> to another.
Which is to say, That the <hi>Pith</hi> is nothing else but a <hi>Rete mirabile,</hi> or
an Infinite Number of <hi>Fibres</hi> exquisitely small, and admirably Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
together: as by cutting the <hi>Pith</hi> with a <hi>Razor,</hi> and so view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it with a good <hi>Glass,</hi> may be seen. See the <hi>Figures</hi> belonging to
the <hi>Third Book.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. All <hi>Plants</hi> exhibit this Spectable, not alike distincty; those
best, with the largest <hi>Bladders.</hi> Nor the same <hi>Pith,</hi> in any condition;
but best, when dry: Because then, the <hi>Sap</hi> being voided, the spaces
betwixt the <hi>Fibrous Threds,</hi> and so the <hi>Threds</hi> themselves, are more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
discernable. Yet is it not to be dryed, after Cutting; Because
its several parts, will thereupon coincide and become deformed. But to
be chosen, while the <hi>Plant</hi> is yet growing; at which time, it may be
often found dry, yet undeformed; as in the <hi>Trunks</hi> of <hi>Common Thistle,
Jerusalem Artichoke,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>9. §. Neither are these <hi>Threds,</hi> so far as I can observe, Single <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bires;</hi>
but usually, consist of several together. Nor are they <hi>simply</hi>
Collateral, but by the weftage of other <hi>Fibres,</hi> in their natural Estate,
knit together; much after the same manner as the <hi>Spiral Fibres</hi> of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100350:66"/>
                        <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi> This Connexion I have no where so well seen, as in the
White <hi>Bottoms</hi> of the <hi>Bladders</hi> of a <hi>Bulrush,</hi> being cut traverse; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they have the appearance, of very Fine and close <hi>Needle-work.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. §. The <hi>Fibres</hi> by which the said <hi>Threds</hi> are knit together, I
think are all Single: and are seldom and scarcely visible, except by
obliquely Tearing the <hi>Pith;</hi> by which means, they will appear through
the Glass, broken off, sometimes, a quarter or half an Inch, or an
Inch in Length; and as small as one Single <hi>Thred</hi> of a <hi>Spiders Webb.</hi>
In a <hi>Bulrush,</hi> they are sometimes discernable in cutting by the Length.
These <hi>Fibres,</hi> and the <hi>Threds,</hi> they knit together, for the most part,
are so pellucid, and closely situate, that they frequently seem to
make One entire Body, as a picce of <hi>Ice</hi> or a film of <hi>Water</hi> it
self: or even as <hi>Animal Skins</hi> sometimes shew, which yet are known
to be <hi>Fibrous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. §. The Situation of these <hi>Threds,</hi> is contrary to that of the
<hi>Vessels,</hi> as those by the Length, so these, chiefly, by the Bredth of the
<hi>Root,</hi> or horizontally, from one edge of the <hi>Pith</hi> to the other. They are
continued circularly; whereby, as oft as they keep within the compass
of the several <hi>Bladders,</hi> the said <hi>Bladders</hi> are Round: But where they
winde out of one <hi>Bladder,</hi> into another, they mutually Intersect a <hi>Chord</hi>
of their several <hi>Circles;</hi> by which means, the <hi>Bladders</hi> become Angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
                     <p>12. §. The Contexture, likewise, both of the <hi>Parenchymous Part</hi>
of the <hi>Barque,</hi> and of the Diametral <hi>Portions</hi> inserted betwixt the <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous;</hi>
is the same with this of the <hi>Pith,</hi> now described; that is, <hi>Fibrous.</hi>
Whence we understand, How the several <hi>Braces</hi> and <hi>Threds</hi> of the <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi>
are made: For the <hi>Vessels</hi> running by the length of the <hi>Root,</hi> as the
<hi>Warp;</hi> by the <hi>Parenchymous Fibres</hi> running cross or horizontally, as
the <hi>Woof:</hi> they are thus <hi>knit</hi> and as it were <hi>stitched</hi> up together.
Yet their <hi>weftage</hi> seemeth not to be <hi>simple,</hi> as in Cloath; but that
many of the <hi>Parenchymous Fibres</hi> are <hi>wraped</hi> round about each
<hi>Vessel;</hi> and, in the same manner, are continued from one <hi>Vessel</hi> to
another; thereby knitting them altogether, more closely, into one
<hi>Tubulary Thred;</hi> and those <hi>Threds,</hi> again, into one <hi>Brace:</hi> much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of the <hi>Needle work</hi> called <hi>Back-Stitch</hi> or that used in
Quilting of Balls. Some obscure sight hereof, may be taken in a <hi>Thred</hi>
of <hi>Cambrick,</hi> through a <hi>Microscope.</hi> But it is most visible, in the <hi>Leaves</hi>
and <hi>Flowers</hi> of some <hi>Plants.</hi> The Delineation of these Things I shall
therefore omit, till we come hereafter to speak of the other <hi>Parts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13. §. From what hath been said, it may be conjectured; That
the <hi>Aer Vessels</hi> successively appearing in the <hi>Barque,</hi> are formed, not
out of any <hi>Fluid Matter,</hi> as are the original ones: But of the <hi>Parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Fibres; sc.</hi> by changing them from a <hi>Spherical</hi> to a <hi>Tubulary
Forme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>14. §. From the precedents, it is also manifest, That all the <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymous
Parts</hi> of a <hi>Root,</hi> are <hi>Fibrous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>15. §. And lastly, That the whole Body of a <hi>Root,</hi> consisteth of
<hi>Vessels</hi> and <hi>Fibres.</hi> And, That these <hi>Fibres</hi> themselves, are Tubulous,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100350:67"/>
or so many more <hi>Vessels,</hi> is most probable: There only wanteth a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
perfection of <hi>Microscopes</hi> to determine.</p>
                     <p>16. §. The <hi>Contents</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> are, sometimes <hi>Liquor,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a <hi>Vaporous-Aer.</hi> The <hi>Liquor</hi> is always Diaphanous, as that of the
<hi>Parenchymous Part</hi> of the <hi>Barque;</hi> and in nature, not much differing
from it. The <hi>Aer</hi> is sometimes less, and sometimes more <hi>Vaporous,</hi> than
that of the <hi>Barque.</hi> By this <hi>Aer</hi> I mean, that which is contained in the
<hi>Bladders.</hi> Within the Concaves of the <hi>Fibres</hi> which compose the <hi>Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
I suppose, there is another different Sort of <hi>Aer.</hi> So that as in
the <hi>Bladders</hi> is contained a more <hi>Aqueous;</hi> and in the <hi>Vessels,</hi> a more
<hi>Essential Liquor:</hi> So sometimes, in the same <hi>Bladders,</hi> is contained a
more <hi>Vaporous;</hi> and in the <hi>Fibres,</hi> a more Simple and <hi>Essential Aer.</hi>

                        <hi>Theology</hi> the Beginning and End of <hi>Philosophy.</hi>
                     </note> is, To render the <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi>
of Things. No man, therefore, that denieth <hi>God</hi>
can do this, Truly. For the taking away of the
<hi>first Cause,</hi> maketh all things <hi>Contingent.</hi> Now,
of that which is <hi>Contingent,</hi> although there may
be an <hi>Event;</hi> yet there can be no <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>End:</hi>
so that Men should then study, That, which <hi>is
not.</hi> So the <hi>Causes</hi> of Things, if they are <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent,</hi>
they cannot be <hi>Constant.</hi> For that
which is the <hi>Cause</hi> of This, now; if it be so <hi>Contingently,</hi> it may not be
the <hi>Cause</hi> hereafter: and no <hi>Physical</hi> Proposition, grounded upon the
<hi>Constancy</hi> and Certainty of Things, could have any foundation. He,
therefore, that philosophiseth, and denieth <hi>God,</hi> playeth a childish
Game.</p>
                  <p>2. §. Wherefore <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Reasons</hi> of Things,
duly contemplated, naturally lead us unto <hi>God;</hi> and is one way of
securing our Veneration of Him: giving us, not only a general Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of his <hi>Being;</hi> but a particular one, of most of the several <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications</hi>
thereof. For all <hi>Goodness, Righteousness, Proportion, Order,
Truth,</hi> or whatever else is Excellent and Amiable in the <hi>Creatures;</hi> it is
the Demonstration of the like in <hi>God.</hi> For it is impossible, that <hi>God</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:100350:68"/>
should ever make any thing, not like Himself, in some degree or other.
These Things, and the very Notions which we have of them, are <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi>
issuing from the <hi>Womb</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. §. By the same means, we have a greater assurance of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of his <hi>Sacred Word.</hi> That He, who hath <hi>Done</hi> all things so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendently
well; must needs <hi>Speak</hi> as well, as he hath <hi>Done.</hi> That He,
who in so admirable a manner, hath <hi>made</hi> Man; cannot but know best,
What his true <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Faculties</hi> are; and what <hi>Actions</hi> are most
agreeable thereunto: and, that having adorned him with such <hi>Beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
and <hi>Lovely</hi> ones; it is impossible, He should ever put him upon the
Exercise of those <hi>Faculties,</hi> in any way <hi>Deformed</hi> and <hi>Unlovely.</hi> That
He should do all things, so well <hi>Himself;</hi> and yet require his <hi>Creatures,</hi>
to do otherwise, is unconceivable.</p>
                  <p>4. §. And as we may come, hereby, to rectifie our Apprehension of
His <hi>Laws;</hi> so also, of His <hi>Misteries.</hi> For there are many Things, of the
<hi>Manner</hi> of whose Existence, we have no certain Knowledge. Yet, of
their <hi>Existence,</hi> we are as sure, as our <hi>Senses</hi> can make us. But, we may
as well deny, what <hi>God</hi> hath Made, <hi>To be;</hi> as, what he hath Spoken,
<hi>To be true,</hi> because we understand not <hi>how.</hi> And the knowledge of
<hi>Things</hi> being gradually attained, we have occasion to reflect, That some
<hi>Things,</hi> we can now well conceive, which we once thought unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.
I know, therefore, what I <hi>understand</hi> not; but, I know not,
what is <hi>unintelligible:</hi> what I know not now, I may hereafter; or if
not I, another; or if <hi>no Man,</hi> or other <hi>Creature,</hi> it is sufficient, <hi>That
God fully understandeth Himself.</hi> It is not, therefore, the <hi>Knowledge</hi>
of <hi>Nature,</hi> but they are the <hi>wanton phansies</hi> of Mens minds, that dispose
them, either to Forget <hi>God,</hi> or to Think unduly of Him.</p>
                  <p>5. §. Nor have we reason to fear going <hi>too far,</hi> in the Study of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
more, than the <hi>entring</hi> into it: Because, the higher we rise in
the true Knowledge and due Contemplation of <hi>This;</hi> the nearer we
come to the <hi>Divine Author</hi> hereof. Or to think, that there is any
Contradiction, when <hi>Philosophy</hi> teaches that to be done by <hi>Nature;</hi>
which <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Sacred Scriptures,</hi> teach us to be done by <hi>God:</hi>
no more, than to say, That the <hi>Ballance</hi> of a <hi>Watch</hi> is moved by the
next <hi>Wheel;</hi> is to deny that <hi>Wheel,</hi> and the rest, to be moved by the
<hi>Spring;</hi> and that both the <hi>Spring,</hi> and all the other <hi>Parts,</hi> are caused to
move together by the <hi>Maker</hi> of them. So <hi>God</hi> may be truly the <hi>Cause</hi> of
<hi>This Effect,</hi> although a Thousand other <hi>Causes</hi> should be supposed to
intervene: For all <hi>Nature</hi> is as one Great <hi>Engine,</hi> made by, and held
in His Hand. And as it is the Watch-makers <hi>Art,</hi> that the <hi>Hand</hi> moves
regularly, fromhour to hour, although he put not his Finger still to
it: So is it the Demonstration of <hi>Divine Wisdome,</hi> that the Parts of
<hi>Nature</hi> are so harmoniously contrived and set together; as to conspire
to all kind of Natural Motions and Effects, without the Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and Immediate Influence of the <hi>Author</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>6. §. Therefore, as the <hi>Original Being</hi> of all Things, is the most
proper Demonstration of <hi>Gods Power:</hi> So the <hi>successive Generations,</hi> and
<hi>Operations</hi> of Things are the most proper Demonstration of his <hi>Wisdom.</hi>
For if we should suppose, that <hi>God</hi> did now make, or do any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by
any Thing; then, no <hi>Effect</hi> would be produced by a <hi>Natural Cause:</hi>
and consequently, He would still be upon the Work of <hi>Creation:</hi> which
yet <hi>Sacred Scripture</hi> assureth us, He <hi>resteth from.</hi> And we might exspect
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100350:68"/>
the Formation of a <hi>Child,</hi> in an <hi>Egg,</hi> as well as in a <hi>Womb;</hi> or of a <hi>Chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi>
out of a <hi>Stone,</hi> as an <hi>Egg:</hi> And all Sorts of <hi>Animals,</hi> as well as
<hi>Plants,</hi> might propagate their <hi>Species,</hi> without Coition: and the
like. For <hi>Infinite Power,</hi> needeth not make any difference in the
Things it undertakes to manage. But in that, these Things are not
only <hi>made,</hi> but <hi>so made,</hi> that is, according to such certain Natural
Laws, as to produce their <hi>Natural Effects;</hi> here is the Sensible and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
Evidence of his <hi>Wisdom.</hi> Wherefore as the Wisdom of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is not seen, by the King his interposing Himself in every Case; but
in the contrivance of the <hi>Laws,</hi> and Constitution of <hi>Ministers</hi> in such
sort, that it shall be as effectually determin'd, as if he did so indeed:
So the more complicated and vastly Numerous, we allow the <hi>Natural
Causes</hi> of Things to be; the more duely we conceive of that <hi>Wisdom,</hi>
which thus disposeth of them all, to their several <hi>Effects:</hi> All Things
being thus, as <hi>Ministers</hi> in the Hands of <hi>God,</hi> conspiring together a
Thousand <hi>Ways,</hi> towards a Thousand <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Ends,</hi> at one time;
and that with the same certainty, as if he did prepose to each, the
same Omnipotent <hi>Fiat,</hi> which he used at the Creation of the
World.</p>

Infinite Occurrences, and secret Intrigues, 'tis made up of; which
we cannot skill, but by the help of manifold <hi>Means;</hi> and those, in
the foregoing <hi>Idea,</hi> have been lately proposed. Wherein, although
some <hi>Experiments</hi> have been briefly touch'd: yet that which I have
hitherto chiefly prosecuted, hath been the <hi>Anatomical</hi> Part; and that
not throughly neither. Notwithstanding, so far as Observations
already made will conduct us, I shall endeavour to go. And if, for
the better clearing of the way, I have intermixed some Conjectures: I
think they are not meerly such, but for which I have layd down some
Grounds, and of which, the <hi>Series</hi> also of the following <hi>Discourse,</hi> may
be some further proof.</p>
                  <p>8. §. LET US say then, that the <hi>Root</hi> of a <hi>Plant</hi> being lodged in
some Soil,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>First,</hi> How the <hi>Ground</hi> is prepared.</note> for its more convenient growth; 'tis necessary the Soil
should be duly prepared for it. The <hi>Rain,</hi> therefore, falling and soak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the Soyl, somewhat diluteth the Dissoluble <hi>Principles</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
contained; and renders them more easily communicable to the
<hi>Root:</hi> Being as a <hi>Menstruum,</hi> which extracteth those <hi>Principles,</hi> from
the other greater and useless part of the Soil.</p>
                  <p>9. §. And the warm <hi>Sun,</hi> joyned with the diluting <hi>Rain,</hi> by both,
as it were a <hi>Digestion</hi> of the Soil, or a gentile <hi>Fermentation</hi> amongst its
several Parts, will follow: whereby the Dissoluble Parts therein, will
rot and mellow: that is, those <hi>Principles</hi> which as yet remained more
<hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ixed,</hi> will now be further <hi>resolved and unlocked,</hi> and more copiously
and equally spread themselves through the Body of the Soil.</p>
                  <p>10. §. These <hi>Principles,</hi> being with the growth of <hi>Plants</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
exhausted, and needing a repair; the successions, therefore, of
Wet, Wind, and other Weather, beat down and rot the <hi>Leaves</hi> and
other <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi> Whereby these (as <hi>Weeds</hi> which are wont to
be buried under ground) become a <hi>natural M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

the Soil: Being thus, in part, out of their own Resolved <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
annually Compounded again.</p>
                  <p>11. §. Many of these <hi>Principles,</hi> upon their <hi>Resolution,</hi> being by
the <hi>Sun</hi> more attenuated and volatilized; continually ascend into
the <hi>Aer,</hi> and are mixed therewith. Where, although they lose not
their <hi>Vegatable Nature,</hi> yet being amongst other purer <hi>Principles;</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
also, depositing their Earthy feculencies, become more subtile,
simple and Essential Bodies.</p>
                  <p>12. §. And the <hi>Aer</hi> being of an <hi>Elastick</hi> or <hi>Springy</hi> Nature, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
more or less, upon all Bodies; it thereby forceth and insinuateth
it self into the Soil, through all its permeable Pores. Upon its own
entrance, it carries also many of the said <hi>Vegetable</hi> and <hi>Essential Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
along with it; which, together with the rest, are spread all over
the Body of the Soil. By which means, though a less Vehement, yet
more Subtil <hi>Fermentation,</hi> and with the least advantage of warmth,
continuable, will be effected.</p>
                  <p>13. §. The <hi>Principles</hi> being thus farther <hi>resolved</hi> and subtilized,
would presently exhale away, if the <hi>Rain,</hi> again, did not prevent.
Which, therefore, falling upon and soaking through the Ground, is as a
fresh <hi>Menstruum,</hi> saturate or impregnate with many of them. And as
it still sinketh lower, it carries them along with it self, from the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial,
to the Deeper parts of the Ground: thus, not only maturing
those parts also, which, otherwise, would be more lean and cold;
but therein likewise, laying up and securing a <hi>Store,</hi> more gradually
and thriftily to be bestowed upon the Upper parts again, as they need.</p>
                  <p>14. §. And <hi>Autumn</hi> having laid up the <hi>Store, Winter</hi> following
thereupon, doth, as it were, lock the doors upon it. In which time,
some warmer Intervals, serve further and gradually to mature the stored
<hi>Principles,</hi> without hazard of their being Exhaled. And the <hi>Spring</hi>
returning, sets the doors open again, with warmer and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<hi>Sun,</hi> with gentle and frequent <hi>Rain,</hi> fully resolves the said <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;</hi>
and so furnisheth a plentiful Diet, for all kinds of <hi>Vegetables:</hi>
being a <hi>Composition</hi> of <hi>Water</hi> chiefly, wherein are resolved, some por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Earth, Salt, Acid, Oyl, Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Aer;</hi> or other Bodies of

together; These, with the other <hi>Principles,</hi> all <hi>concentre,</hi> and of
divers <hi>fluids,</hi> become one <hi>fixed</hi> Body, and are gradually <hi>agglutinated</hi> to
the <hi>Vessels;</hi> that is, The <hi>Vessels</hi> are now <hi>nourished.</hi>

22. §. The supply of the <hi>Sap</hi> still continued, the <hi>Principles</hi> thereof
will not only enter into the <hi>Body</hi> of these <hi>Parts,</hi> but also their <hi>Concaves.</hi>
And the <hi>Parenchymous Fibres</hi> being <hi>wrapped</hi> about the <hi>Vessels,</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">P. 1. c. 5. §. 12.</note> as
often as the said <hi>Fibres</hi> are more <hi>turgid</hi> with their own contained <hi>Fluid,</hi>
they will thereby be somewhat <hi>shortned,</hi> or contract in length; and so
must needs <hi>bind</hi> upon the <hi>Vessels,</hi> and thereby, as it were, <hi>squeeze</hi> some
part of the <hi>Fluid,</hi> contained both within themselves and the <hi>Vessels,</hi>
back again into the <hi>Bladders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>23. §. And the <hi>Sap</hi> herein, being thus <hi>tinctured</hi> with some of the
<hi>united Principles</hi> of the <hi>Vessels,</hi> divers of them will now also insinuate
themselves into the <hi>Parenchymous Fibres,</hi> and be incorporated with
them: Whereby, the said <hi>Fibres,</hi> which before were only <hi>relaxed</hi> and
<hi>dilated,</hi> are now also <hi>nourished,</hi> and not till now. Some portion of
the <hi>united Principles</hi> both of the <hi>Parenchymous</hi> and <hi>Lignous Parts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
necessary to the true <hi>nutrition</hi> of Each: As the Confusion and
joynt assistance of both the <hi>Arterious</hi> and <hi>Nervous Fluids,</hi> is to the
nourishment or coagulation of the <hi>Parts</hi> in <hi>Animals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. §. Some portion of the <hi>Sap</hi> thus doubly <hi>tinctured,</hi> is at the
same time transmitted to, and enters the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Aer-Vessels;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
chiefly of <hi>Water, Aer,</hi> and <hi>Acid;</hi> and, in like manner, as in the
other <hi>Parts</hi> is herein <hi>agglutinated.</hi> And the appulse and pressure of the
<hi>Sap</hi> still continued, some portion hereof is also trajected into the <hi>Concaves</hi>
of the said <hi>Vessels;</hi> existing therein as a most <hi>Compounded Fluid;</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
more or less, both of the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Tinctures</hi> of the other
<hi>Organical Parts,</hi> and of the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> themselves; being as it were, a
<hi>Mixed Resolution</hi> from them all.</p>
                  <p>25. §. And the <hi>Parenchymous Fibres</hi> being <hi>wrapped</hi> about These,
as about the other <hi>Vessels,</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">P. 1. c. 5. §. 12.</note> and, in like manner, <hi>binding</hi> upon them;
they thus frequently <hi>squeeze</hi> part of the said contained <hi>Fluid</hi> out
again: As necessary, though not to the immediate Nourishment of the
<hi>Parts,</hi> yet the due Qualification of the <hi>Sap;</hi> being a Constant <hi>Aerial
Ferment,</hi> successively stored up within the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> and thence trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to the <hi>Sap,</hi> in the other <hi>Organical Parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>26. §. And that there may be a better Transition of the <hi>Sap</hi> thus
<hi>tinctured,</hi> to the several <hi>Organical Parts;</hi> therefore, none of them are
close set and compact within themselves, severally: For so, they
would be inaccessible to the <hi>Sap,</hi> and their inward Portions, wanting
a due supply of <hi>Aliment,</hi> would be starved. But the <hi>Vessels,</hi> both of
<hi>Aer</hi> and <hi>Sap,</hi> being every where divided into <hi>Braced</hi> Portions, and
other <hi>Parenchymous</hi> Portions, filling up the spaces every where betwixt
them<note n="c" place="margin">P. 1. c. 3. §. 13. &amp;c. 4. §. 4, 5, 7.</note>; there is therefore a free and copious communication of the
<hi>Sap,</hi> (and so of all the <hi>Tinctures</hi> successively transfused into it) from
<hi>Part</hi> to <hi>Part,</hi> and to every Portion of every <hi>Part:</hi> The <hi>Parenchymous</hi>
Portions, running betwixt the <hi>Braces,</hi> as the smaller <hi>Vessels</hi> do through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>Viscera,</hi> in <hi>Animals.</hi> Whereby, none of them want that
Matter, which is necessary either for their <hi>Nutrition,</hi> or for the good
Estate of their <hi>Contents,</hi> or for the due period of their Growth.</p>
                  <p>27. §. For the better <hi>Tempering</hi> of the several parts of the <hi>Sap,</hi>
serve the <hi>Diametral</hi> Portions of the <hi>Parenchymous Body</hi> whichrun some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
directly through the <hi>Barque,</hi> as in <hi>Lovage, Parsley,</hi> &amp;c. is described
and figur'd<note n="d" place="margin">P. 1. c. 3. §. 7, 8.</note> Which being, all or most of them, continued be
twixt both the <hi>Succiserous</hi> and the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> from the Circumference
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100350:70"/>
to the Centre; they hereby carry off a more Copious and <hi>Aerial
Ferment</hi> from the One, and communicate it unto the Other. For as
the <hi>Sap</hi> enters the <hi>Barque,</hi> the more <hi>liquid</hi> part, still passeth into the
<hi>succulent</hi> Portions thereof; the more <hi>Aery,</hi> is separated into those
White and Dryer <hi>Diametral</hi> ones; and in its passage betwixt the <hi>Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> is all along communicated to them. Yet is it not a
pure or <hi>simple Aer,</hi> but such as carries a <hi>Tincture</hi> with it, from the <hi>Succife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Vessels.</hi> And therefore it is observable, That when the <hi>Diametral</hi>
Portions are more distant, the <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> run not in a Straight Line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, but are Reciprocally so inclined, as to touch upon them;
as in <hi>Lovage</hi> is visible: Thereby communicating their <hi>Tincture</hi> to the
<hi>Aer,</hi> as it passeth by them, through the said <hi>Diametral</hi> Portions.</p>
                  <p>28. §. By the continual appulse of fresh <hi>Sap,</hi> some, both of the
<hi>aery,</hi> and of all the other parts thereof are transmitted into the <hi>Pith;</hi>
where, finding more room, it will yet more kindly be <hi>digested.</hi> Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
having the advantage herein of some degree of Warmth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
herein remoter from the <hi>Soil,</hi> and, as it were, <hi>Tunn'd</hi> up within
the <hi>Wood,</hi> or the <hi>Mass</hi> of surrounding <hi>Vessels.</hi> So that the <hi>Pith,</hi> is a
<hi>Repository</hi> of better <hi>Aliment</hi> gradually supplied to those <hi>Succiferous
Vessels,</hi> which are frequently scattered up and down therein, and
which ascend into the <hi>Trunk.</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">P. 1. c. 5. §. 3.</note> But where no <hi>succiferous Vessels</hi> are
mixed, herewith, it usually becomes Dryer, and is replenished with a
more <hi>Aerial</hi> and <hi>Warmer Sap;</hi> whereby the growth of the <hi>Caulis</hi> is
promoted, as by an <hi>Hot Bed</hi> set just under it. And in many <hi>Plants</hi> with
divers knobbed <hi>Roots,</hi> the younger are more succulent, serving chiefly
to feed the <hi>Stalk:</hi> the Elder are spongy and fill'd with <hi>Aer,</hi> for the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
of the <hi>Sap,</hi> and more early growth of the <hi>Stalk:</hi> as in little
<hi>Celandine, Dogstones</hi> and all of that Kindred. And thus all the <hi>Parts</hi>
have a fit <hi>Aliment</hi> provided for their <hi>Nourishment</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>29. §. IN THIS <hi>Nourishment,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts are Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd and Form'd.</note> the <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Sap</hi> are, as is
said, <hi>concentred</hi> and <hi>locked</hi> up one within another:<note n="b" place="margin">§. 21.</note> Whence it is,
that the <hi>Organical Parts,</hi> being cleansed of their <hi>Contents,</hi> have none of
them any <hi>Taste</hi> or <hi>Smell,</hi> as in the <hi>Piths</hi> of <hi>Plants, Paper</hi> and <hi>Linen
Cloth</hi> is evident.<note n="c" place="margin">Idea, §. 49, 51.</note> Because till by <hi>Digestion,</hi> violent <hi>Destillation,</hi> or
some other way, they are resolved, they cannot act upon the <hi>Organs</hi>
of those Senses. For the same reason, they are never <hi>tinctured,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
by their <hi>Contents:</hi> and although, to the bare Eye, they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
shew <hi>White,</hi> yet viewed through a <hi>Microscope,</hi> they all appear
<hi>transparent.</hi> In like manner, as the <hi>Serum</hi> of <hi>Blood, Whites</hi> of <hi>Eggs,
Tendons, Hairs</hi> and <hi>Horns</hi> themselves are <hi>transparent,</hi> and without
much <hi>Smell</hi> or <hi>Taste,</hi> their <hi>Principles</hi> being, in all of them, more or
less <hi>concentred:</hi> But when ever these <hi>Principles,</hi> are forcibly <hi>resolved,</hi>
they are ever variously invested with all those <hi>Qualities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>30. §. And as from the <hi>Concentration</hi> of the <hi>Principles,</hi> in every
<hi>Organical Part,</hi> the said <hi>Parts</hi> do thus far, all agree: So, from the
<hi>Predominion</hi> of the <hi>Principles</hi> of each <hi>Part,</hi> the rest are controuled,
not only to a <hi>Concentration,</hi> but an <hi>Assimilation</hi> also; whereby, the
<hi>Specifick Differences,</hi> of the several <hi>Organical Parts,</hi> are preserved.
Hence the <hi>succiferous Vessels</hi> are always <hi>Tough</hi> and very Pliable; for so
are all <hi>Barques,</hi> wherein these <hi>Vessels</hi> abound; so is a Handful of <hi>Flax,</hi>
which is nothing else but a heap of the <hi>succiferous Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Barque</hi> of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100350:71"/>
that <hi>Plant.</hi> For besides <hi>Water,</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> an <hi>Alkaline Salt</hi> and <hi>Oyl</hi> are,
as is said, the predominant <hi>Principles</hi> of these <hi>Vessels.</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">§. 21.</note> It is then the
<hi>Oyl,</hi> chiefly, by which these <hi>Vessels</hi> are <hi>Tough:</hi> for being of a tenacious
Nature, by taking hold of other <hi>Principles,</hi> it marries them together;
and the <hi>Alkaline Salt</hi> and <hi>Earth, concentred</hi> with it, addeth to it
more <hi>Strength.</hi> Hence the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of most Bodies, especially
those that abound with <hi>Oyl</hi> and a <hi>Sal Alkali,</hi> is <hi>brittle</hi> and <hi>friable;</hi>
those <hi>Principles,</hi> which were the <hi>Ligaments</hi> of the rest, being forced
away from them. From the same Cause, the <hi>Parenchymous Parts</hi> of a
<hi>Root,</hi> even in their Natural State, are <hi>brittle</hi> and <hi>friable; sc.</hi> Because
their <hi>Earthy,</hi> and especially <hi>Oleous</hi> and <hi>Saline Principles</hi> are, as is said,<note n="b" place="margin">§. 19.</note>
so very few. Therefore all <hi>Piths</hi> and more <hi>simple Parenchyma's,</hi> break
<hi>short,</hi> so <hi>Corn,</hi> and the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Potato's,</hi> and divers other <hi>Plants,</hi>
being dryed, will easily be rub'd to <hi>Meal;</hi> and many <hi>Apples,</hi> after
Frosts, eat <hi>mealy;</hi> the <hi>Parenchymous Parts</hi> of all which, are not only
by <hi>Analogy,</hi> but in Substance or Essence, the self same Body.<note n="c" place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 7. §. 14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>31. §. And as the <hi>Consistence</hi> of the several <hi>Organical Parts,</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
on their <hi>Principles;</hi> so are their <hi>Figures.</hi> And first, the
<hi>Succiferous Vessels,</hi> from their <hi>Alkaline Salt,</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">P. 2. §. 21.</note> grow in Length. For
by that Dimension, chiefly, This <hi>Salt</hi> always <hi>shoots:</hi> And being a less
moveable <hi>Principle</hi> than the rest, and so apt more speedily to <hi>fix</hi> or
<hi>shoot:</hi> It thus overrules them to its own <hi>Figure.</hi> And even as the Shape
of a <hi>Button</hi> dependeth on the <hi>Mould,</hi> the <hi>Silk</hi> and other Materials
wrought upon it, being always conformable thereunto: so here; the
<hi>Salt</hi> is, as it were, the <hi>Mould;</hi> about which, the other more passive
<hi>Principles</hi> gathering themselves, they all consort and fashion to it.
Hence also the same <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> are not <hi>pyramidal,</hi> as the <hi>Veins</hi> of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;</hi>
but of an equal bore, from end to end; the <hi>shootings</hi> of the
said <hi>Salt,</hi> being also figured more agreeably to that <hi>Dimension.</hi> And
as by the <hi>Saline Principle,</hi> these <hi>Vessels</hi> are <hi>Long;</hi> so by the <hi>Oleous,</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">Ib.</note>
they are every where <hi>Round,</hi> or properly <hi>Cylindrical;</hi> without some
joynt Efficacy of which <hi>Principle,</hi> the said <hi>Vessels</hi> would be <hi>Flat,</hi> or
some way Edged and <hi>Angular,</hi> as all <hi>saline shoots,</hi> of themselves, are;
as those of <hi>Alum, Vitriol, Sal Ammoniac, Sea Salt, Nitre,</hi> &amp;c. And
because the <hi>Spirituous</hi> and more <hi>Fluid</hi> part of the <hi>Principles,</hi> is least
of all apt to <hi>fix;</hi> while therefore, the other parts fix round about,
This will remain moveable in the <hi>Centre;</hi> from whence every <hi>Vessel</hi> is
formed, not into a <hi>solid,</hi> but <hi>hollow Cylinder;</hi> that is, becomes a
<hi>Tube.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>32. §. The <hi>Lactiferous Vessels</hi> are <hi>tubulary,</hi> as the <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi>
but of a somewhat wider <hi>Concave</hi> or <hi>Bore.</hi> For being their <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
are less <hi>Earthy</hi> and <hi>Oleous,</hi> and also more loosely <hi>Concentred;</hi> as
from their easie corruption or <hi>Resolution</hi> by the <hi>Aer,</hi> it appears they
are: they are therefore more tender, and so more easily dilative, and
yielding to the said <hi>Spirituous</hi> part in the Centre. And by this means,
obtaining a wider <hi>Bore,</hi> they are more adapted to the free motion of
the <hi>Milky Content:</hi> which being an Oleous and Thicker <hi>Liquor,</hi> than
that in the <hi>Lympheducts;</hi> and having no advantage of <hi>pulsation,</hi> as the
<hi>Blood</hi> hath in <hi>Animals;</hi> might sometimes be apt to stagnate, if the
<hi>Vessels,</hi> through which it moves, were not somewhat wider.</p>

33. §. As the <hi>Saline Principle</hi> is the <hi>Mould</hi> of the <hi>Succiferous,</hi> so
is the <hi>Aerial</hi> of the <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">P. 1. c. 4. §. 23. &amp; P. 2. §. 24.</note> Now the Particles of <hi>Aer</hi> strictly so
called, at least of that part of it concerned in the Generation of the
<hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> I suppose, are crooked: and that by composition of many
of those crooked ones together, some of them become Spiral, or of
some other winding <hi>Figure:</hi> and that thereupon dependeth the <hi>Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi>
Property of the <hi>Aer,</hi> or its being capable of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and
<hi>Condensation</hi> by force. Wherefore, the said <hi>crooked</hi> Particles of the
<hi>Aer,</hi> first <hi>shooting</hi> and <hi>setting</hi> together, as the <hi>Mould,</hi> the other <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
cling and <hi>fix</hi> conformably round about them. So that, as by
force of the <hi>Saline Principles,</hi> the rest of them are made to <hi>shoot</hi> out
in <hi>Long continued Fibres;</hi> so by force of the <hi>Aerial,</hi> those <hi>Fibers</hi> are
still disposed into <hi>Spiral Lines,</hi> thus making up the <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi> And
according as there are fewer of these <hi>Aerial</hi> Particles, in proportion to
the <hi>Saline,</hi> the <hi>Concave</hi> of the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> is variously wider, or the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi>
continue their <hi>shooting</hi> by wider <hi>Rings;</hi> as those that come nearer
to a <hi>right Line,</hi> and so are more complient to the <hi>Figure</hi> and shooting
of the <hi>Saline</hi> parts. And whereas the <hi>Lympheducts,</hi> shooting out on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in length, are never sensibly <hi>amplified</hi> beyond their original size:
These, on the contrary, always, more or less, enlarge their <hi>Diameter;</hi>
because their <hi>Fibres,</hi> being disposed into <hi>Spiral Lines,</hi> must needs
therefore, as they continue their growth, be still dilated into greater
and greater <hi>Rings.</hi> And being at the bottom of the <hi>Root</hi> more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from the <hi>Aer,</hi> and so having somewhat fewer Particles purely
<hi>Aerial,</hi> there ingredient to them, then at the top; they fall more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the government of the <hi>Saline,</hi> and so come nearer to a <hi>right Line,</hi>
that is into greater <hi>Circles;</hi> and so the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> made up of those
<hi>Circles,</hi> are there generally wider.<note n="b" place="margin">P. 1. c. 4. §. 16.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>34. §. By mediation of their <hi>Principles,</hi> the <hi>Parenchymous Parts</hi>
likewise of a <hi>Root</hi> have their proper <hi>Contexture.</hi> For from their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
Salt</hi> they are <hi>Fibrous;</hi> from their <hi>Oyl,</hi> the <hi>Fibres</hi> are <hi>Round,</hi> and
in all parts even within themselves; and from their <hi>Spirit,</hi> it is most
probable, that they are also <hi>hollow.</hi> But because the <hi>Spirit</hi> is, here,
more copious than the <hi>Aer;</hi> and the <hi>Saline Principle</hi> an <hi>Acid,</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">§. 19.</note>
and so, more under the government of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> than is an <hi>Alkali;</hi>
therefore are not the said <hi>Fibres</hi> continued in <hi>straight Lines,</hi> as the

ways,</hi> agreeable to the like <hi>motions</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that most <hi>active,</hi>
and here most <hi>predominant Principle.</hi> And the <hi>Spirituous Parts</hi> being,
as is said, here more copious and redundant, they will not only suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to fill up the Concaves of the <hi>Fibres,</hi> but will also gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into innumerable little spaces, without them: whence the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi>
cannot wind close together, as Thred, in a <hi>Bottom</hi> of Yarn; but

disposed;<note place="margin">Tab. 7, 8, 9.</note> those next the <hi>Barque,</hi> and so nearer the <hi>Aer,</hi> are postu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
more Regularly, and usually into <hi>Rays.</hi> For the same reason it
may be; that even the <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Barque,</hi> as often as the <hi>Aer
Vessels</hi> are more numerous, are usually disposed into <hi>Rays,</hi> as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the direction of the <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi> And that the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the
<hi>Barque,</hi> is disposed into <hi>Diametral Portions:</hi> and that where the <hi>Aer
Vessels</hi> are fewer or smaller, these <hi>Portions</hi> are likewise smaller or none;
as in <hi>Chervil, Asparagus, Dandelion, Orpine, Bistort, Horse-Radish,
Potato's,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Tab. 7, 8, 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>37. §. The said Aetherial parts of the <hi>Aer,</hi> have a Power over
the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> not only thus to Dispose them; but also to Sollicite
and <hi>spread</hi> them abroad from the Center towards the Circumference
of the <hi>Root.</hi> By which means, those <hi>Roots</hi> which have no <hi>Pith</hi> in
their lower parts, obtain one in their upper.<note n="c" place="margin">P. 1. c. 5. §. 1.</note> And the same <hi>Pith,</hi>
which in the lower part, is ratably, small, in the upper, is more or
less enlarged.<note n="d" place="margin">Ib. §. 4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>38. §. The <hi>Spreading</hi> of these <hi>Vessels</hi> is varied, not only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Force</hi> the <hi>Aer</hi> hath upon them, but also their own greater
or less <hi>Aptitude</hi> to yield thereto. As often therefore, as they are Slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
they will also be more Pliable and recessive from the Centre,
towards the Circumference. Hence, in such <hi>Roots</hi> where they are
small,<note place="margin">Tab. 2, &amp; 6.</note> they stand more distant; as in <hi>Turnep, Jerusalem Artichoke, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tato's,</hi>
and others; and so their <hi>Braces</hi> are fewer: and in the same
<hi>Root,</hi> where they are smaller, their distance is greater. Besides, in
these smaller <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> the <hi>Rings</hi> being less, and the <hi>Spiral Fibres</hi>
whereof they are made, continuing to <hi>shoot;</hi> the said <hi>Rings</hi> therefore,
must needs be so many more, as they are smaller; and so take up more
space by the length of the <hi>Root;</hi> and so, not being capable of being
crowded in a <hi>right line,</hi> every <hi>Vessel</hi> will be forced to recede to a <hi>crooked</hi>
or <hi>bowed</hi> one.</p>
                  <p>39. §. The <hi>Sap Vessels,</hi> being by the <hi>Parenchymous Fibres</hi> knit to <hi>these,</hi>
will likewise comply with Their motion, and spread abroad with them.
Yet being still smaller<note n="e" place="margin">P. 1. c. 3. §. 16.</note> and more pliable than the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> and so
more yielding to the intercurrent <hi>Fibres</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> their
<hi>braced Threds</hi> will, sometimes, be much more divaricated, than those
of the <hi>Aer-Vessels;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 6.</note> as in <hi>Jerusalem Artichoke.</hi> And because the <hi>Succiferous
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100350:72"/>
Vessels,</hi> although they are joyned to the <hi>Aerial</hi> by the <hi>Parenchymous
Fibres,</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">P. 1. c. 5. §. 12.</note> yet are not continuous with them; neither fall under
the like <hi>Attractive Power</hi> of the <hi>Aer,</hi> as the <hi>Aerial</hi> do; the <hi>Aerial</hi>
therefore, upon their spreading, do not always carry all the <hi>Succife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi>
along with them; but often, if not always, leave many of them
behind them sprinkled up and down the <hi>Pith;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 6.</note> as in <hi>Parsley, Carrot,
Jerusalem Artichoke, Turnep,</hi> &amp;c. may be seen.</p>
                  <p>40. §. The <hi>spreading</hi> of the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> still continued, several
of them, at length, break forth beyond the circumference of the
<hi>Root;</hi> and so are distributed, either in the lower parts, into <hi>Branches</hi>
and <hi>Strings;</hi> or at the top, into <hi>Leaves.</hi> And lest they should all
spread themselves into <hi>Leaves,</hi> and none be left for the <hi>Caulis;</hi> as
where they are very small, or the <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> to bound them, are but
few, they might; therefore divers of them are, oftentimes, more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<hi>braced</hi> in the Centre;<note place="margin">Tab. 6.</note> for which reason, they cannot so easily
separate and spread themselves from thence, but run more inwardly up
into the <hi>Caulis,</hi> as in <hi>Borage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>41. §. FROM THE various <hi>Sizes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How the whole <hi>Root</hi> is differently sized and shaped<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

of the Parts, <hi>Roots</hi> are variously <hi>sized, shaped, moved</hi> and <hi>aged.</hi> Those
which, by their Annual Growth, are large; have fewer, both <hi>Aerial,</hi>
and <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi> and a more copious <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> So that the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi>
or rather, the <hi>Aery Ferment</hi> contained in them, <hi>volatilizing</hi>
only a smaller portion of the <hi>Sap;</hi> the said <hi>Sap</hi> is less capable of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
into the <hi>Trunk;</hi> and so must needs remain and <hi>fix</hi> more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously
in the <hi>Root,</hi> which is thereby more augmented. And where
the <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> alone, are but few, the <hi>Root</hi> is yet, ratably, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
large: but where they are numerous, it is never so, as to its
Annual Growth, in any proportion to their Number: Because their
<hi>Tincture,</hi> which is <hi>Alkaline,</hi> will go farther in <hi>setting</hi> the <hi>Parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Parts:</hi> than the <hi>Tincture</hi> of <hi>These,</hi> which is <hi>Acidulate,</hi> will go,
in <hi>setting Them.</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">P. 2. §. 31.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>42. §. When the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are more pliable and sequent to the
Attraction of the <hi>Aer,</hi> and so <hi>spread</hi> themselves, and the <hi>Succiferous</hi>
together with them, more abroad; in the manner as hath been said;
the <hi>Root</hi> also will grow more in <hi>Breadth;</hi> the nutrition of the <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymous
Parts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 2, <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.</note> to which the <hi>Vessels</hi> are adjacent, being thus, by the
same dimension,<note place="margin">Tab. 7, <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.</note> more augmented; as in <hi>Turnep, Jerusalem Artichoke,</hi> &amp;c.
But where these are not spread abroad, the <hi>Root</hi> is but slender; as in
<hi>Asparagus, Dandelion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>43. §. If the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> be contracted into, or near the Centre,
and are somewhat Large or Numerous; and the <hi>Succiferous,</hi> also more
copiously mixed with, or surrounding them; the <hi>Root</hi> grows very
Long;<note place="margin">Tab. 2, <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.</note> as do those of <hi>Fenil, Vine, Liquirish,</hi> &amp;c. For the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi>
containing a more copious <hi>Ferment,</hi> it will well digest and mature the
<hi>Sap:</hi> Yet the <hi>Succiferous</hi> being over proportioned to them; the <hi>Sap</hi>
will not therefore, be so far volatilized, as to ascend chiefly into the
<hi>Trunk;</hi> but only to subserve a fuller Growth of their <hi>Vessels:</hi> which
being more numerous, and so more sturdy, and less sequent to the
expansive motion of the <hi>Aerial;</hi> this their own Growth, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that of all the other <hi>Parts,</hi> cannot be so much in Breadth,
as Length.</p>

                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:100350:73"/>
44. §. Where the same <hi>Aerial Vessels</hi> are Fewer, or more Contracted,
or sheathed in a Thicker and Closer <hi>Barque;</hi> the <hi>Root</hi> is smooth, and
less <hi>Ramified,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 7, 8.</note> as in <hi>Asparagus, Peony, Dandelion.</hi> But where more
Numerous, sheathed in a Thinner <hi>Barque,</hi> Smaller, or more Dilated;
the <hi>Root</hi> is more <hi>Ramified,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 2, <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.</note> or more <hi>Stringy,</hi> as in <hi>Columbine, Clary,
Beet, Nicotian.</hi> For being, as is said, by these means, more sequent
to the Attraction of the <hi>Aer;</hi> approaching still nearer the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the <hi>Barque,</hi> they at last strike through it, into the <hi>Earth.</hi>
And the <hi>Parenchymous Fibres</hi> being wrapped about them, and the
<hi>Succiferous Vessels</hi> knit to them by those <hi>Fibres;</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">P. 1. c. 5. §. 12.</note> therefore they
never break forth naked, but always invested with some quantity of
these <hi>Parts</hi> as their <hi>Barque:</hi> where by, whatever <hi>Constitutive Part</hi> is
in the <hi>main Body</hi> of the <hi>Root,</hi> the same is also in every <hi>Branch</hi> or
<hi>String.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>45. §. From the same Expansion and Pliability of the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi>
the <hi>Root</hi> oftentimes putteth forth <hi>Root-Buds;</hi> which gradually shoot
up and become so many <hi>Trunks.</hi> In the Formation of which <hi>Buds,</hi>
they are pliable and recessive all kinds of ways; being not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
Outward, toward the Circumference of the <hi>Root,</hi> as in <hi>Root-strings,</hi>
but also spread more Abroad every way, so as to make a <hi>Root-Bud:</hi>
Where as in the said <hi>Root-strings;</hi> they are always more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.<note place="margin">Tab. 6.</note>
Which, in respect of the Disposition of the <hi>Parts,</hi> is the
principal difference betwixt the <hi>Root</hi> and the <hi>Trunk,</hi> as hath been
said.<note n="b" place="margin">P. 1. c. 1. §. 2, 3. Tab. 11.</note> Hence, those <hi>Roots,</hi> chiefly, have <hi>Root-Buds,</hi> which have
the smallest <hi>Aer-Vessels;</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">P. 1. c. 4. §. 15.</note> these, as is said, being the most pliable
and Expansive.</p>
                  <p>46. §. But because the expansiveness of the <hi>Vessels,</hi> dependeth also,
in part, upon the Fewness of their <hi>Braces;</hi> therefore the said <hi>Buds</hi>
shoot forth differently, in divers <hi>Roots.</hi> Where the <hi>Braces</hi> are fewer,
the <hi>Buds</hi> shoot forth beyond the Circumference of the <hi>Root,</hi> as in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
Artichoke;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 6.</note> where more close, as in <hi>Potato's,</hi> the <hi>Buds</hi> lie
a little absconded beneath it; the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> being here, by their
<hi>Braces,</hi> somewhat checked and curbed in, while the <hi>Barque</hi> continueth
to swell into a fuller Growth.</p>
                  <p>47. §. If the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are all along more equally sized, the
<hi>Root</hi> is so also, or <hi>Cylindrical;</hi> as are those of <hi>Eryngo, Horse-Radish,
Marshmallow, Liquirish,</hi> &amp;c. But if unequal, growing still <hi>wider</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>bottom</hi> of the <hi>Root;</hi> then the <hi>Root</hi> is unequal also: But
groweth, as is observable, quite contrarily to the <hi>Aer-Vessels;</hi> not
Greater, as They do; but still smaller, or <hi>pyramidally;</hi> as in <hi>Fenil,
Borage, Nettle, Patience, Thorn-Apple,</hi> &amp;c. is apparent. For the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi>
peing considerably wider about the <hi>bottome</hi> of these <hi>Roots;</hi> they
there contein a more Copious <hi>Ferment:</hi> Whereby the <hi>Sap</hi> is there
also more volatilized, and plentifully advanced to the Upper Parts.
Withal, thus receiving into themselves, and so trasmitting to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Parts, a more plentiful <hi>Vapour,</hi> they hereby rob the <hi>Parenchymous
Parts</hi> of their Aliment, and so stint them in their Growth.</p>
                  <p>48. §. FROM THE different <hi>Proportions</hi> and <hi>Situation</hi> of the
<hi>Parts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How <hi>Roots</hi> are dissently Mov'd.</note> the <hi>Motions</hi> of <hi>Roots</hi> are also various. For where the <hi>Are-Vessels</hi>
are spread abroad and invested with a thinner <hi>Barque;</hi> the <hi>Root</hi> runs
or lies <hi>Level,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 8.</note> as in the <hi>level-Roots</hi> of <hi>Primrose, Bishops-weed, Anemone,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100350:73"/>
may be seen. So that these <hi>Roots,</hi> as by the <hi>Perpendicular Strings,</hi>
which shoot from them into the <hi>Earth,</hi> and wherein the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi>
are contracted into their Center, they are Plucked down<note n="a" place="margin">P. 1. c. 1. §. 15.</note>: So by
the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> which stand nearer the <hi>Aer,</hi> and more under its At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
Power<note n="b" place="margin">P. 2. §. 36.</note> they are invited <hi>upwards;</hi> whereby they have
neither <hi>ascent</hi> nor <hi>descent,</hi> but keep <hi>level,</hi> betwixt both.</p>
                  <p>49. §. But if these <hi>Vessels</hi> are Contracted, standing either in, or
near the Centre, and are invested with a <hi>Barque</hi> proportionably
Thick; the <hi>Root</hi> striketh down <hi>perpendicularly,</hi> as doth that of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 7, 8.</note>
                     <hi>Bugloss, Parsnep,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore the said <hi>Vessels,</hi> although
they are spread abroad in the <hi>level Roots,</hi> yet in the <hi>perpendicular</hi> ones
of the same <hi>Plant,</hi> they are always contracted; as by comparing the
<hi>Level</hi> and <hi>Down-right Roots</hi> of <hi>Ammi, Primrose, Jerusalem Artichoke,
Cowslip,</hi> and others, is manifest.</p>
                  <p>50. §. If the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are Contracted, and Environed with a
greater number of <hi>Succiferous,</hi> the <hi>Root</hi> grows <hi>deep;</hi> that is, <hi>perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular</hi>

                  <p>51. §. If the <hi>Succiferous</hi> are over proportioned to the <hi>Parenchymous

                  <p>52. §. If, on the contrary, the <hi>Parenchymous Parts</hi> are predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the <hi>Aer Vessels;</hi> and that, both in the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Trunk;</hi> then the

                  <p>53. §. Where the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are much <hi>spread</hi> abroad, and also <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,</hi>
the <hi>Root</hi> oftentimes, as to its several parts, <hi>descends</hi> and <hi>ascends</hi>
both at once. So <hi>Radishes</hi> and <hi>Turneps,</hi> at the same time, in which their

<hi>ascend,</hi> or make their Growth <hi>upward.</hi> Hence also, the upper part
of most young <hi>Roots</hi> from <hi>Seed,</hi> ascends: Because the first <hi>Leaves,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
proportionably large, and standing in a free <hi>Aer,</hi> the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi>

that they are wholly advanced into the <hi>Trunk,</hi> and so the <hi>Root</hi> is

thereof; such of the <hi>Principles</hi> in the <hi>Sap,</hi> being admitted into, and
transmitted through them, as are aptest thereunto. In the like manner,
as when <hi>Oyl</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> being poured upon a Paper, the <hi>Water</hi> passeth
through, the <hi>Oyl</hi> sticks: or as the <hi>Chyle</hi> is strained through the <hi>Coats</hi>
of the <hi>Guts,</hi> into the <hi>Lacteal Vessels:</hi> or as <hi>Water</hi> in <hi>Purgations,</hi> is

                  </p>
                  <p>58. §. The <hi>Principles</hi> therefore of the <hi>Parenchymous Fibres</hi> being
<hi>spirituous, acid,</hi> and <hi>aerial,</hi> they will also admit the like into them;
excluding those chiefly which are <hi>Alkaline</hi> and <hi>Oleous.</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">P. 2. §. 19.</note> And as by
the <hi>Conjugation</hi> of such <hi>Principles</hi> in the <hi>Fibres,</hi> the like are capable of
<hi>admittance</hi> into their Body: so the <hi>Proportion</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> of the same
<hi>Principles,</hi> regulates the <hi>transmission</hi> hereof into their <hi>Concave.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the predominant <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Fibres</hi> being chiefly <hi>acid,</hi> next
<hi>spirituous,</hi> and <hi>aery,</hi> the more <hi>aery</hi> ones will be <hi>transmitted.</hi> For if
more of <hi>them</hi> should <hi>fix</hi> they must do so by similitude and adhesion:
But where there are fewer similary parts to adhere to, fewer must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here.
The <hi>Fibres</hi> therefore contain so many parts of <hi>Aer,</hi> as to <hi>admit</hi>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:100350:74"/>
many more into their Body; but not to <hi>fix</hi> them; which therefore
must needs, upon admission, pass through into their <hi>Concave;</hi> where,
together with some other more <hi>spirituous</hi> parts, they make an <hi>Aetherial
Fluid.</hi> And because some <hi>aqueous</hi> or <hi>vaporous</hi> parts will also strain
through with them; hence it is, that as more and more of these enter,
they by degrees still thrust out the <hi>aery</hi> ones; which quitting the more
<hi>succulent Fibres</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> are forced to betake themselves
to the <hi>dryer</hi> ones, <hi>scil.</hi> all those, whereof the <hi>Diametral Portions</hi> do
consist. For the same reason the <hi>Aery</hi> parts being gradually excluded
the <hi>succulent Fibres</hi> of the <hi>Barque;</hi> they are forced to recede and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migrate
into those of the <hi>Pith.</hi> And the <hi>Fibres</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> themselves
being filled, and the <hi>Aery</hi> parts still forced into them; they at length
also strain through the <hi>Fibres</hi> into the <hi>Bladders:</hi> whence it comes to

the <hi>Liquor</hi> conteined in those <hi>Parts,</hi> although it may easily enough

                  </p>
                  <p>61. §. The <hi>Fluid Ferment</hi> contained in the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> is also in
part, dependent on the <hi>Principles</hi> of those <hi>Vessels,</hi> being in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colation
<hi>tinctured</hi> therewith. But because the percolation is not made
<hi>through</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Fibres</hi> whereof the <hi>Vessels</hi> are composed, but
only <hi>betwixt</hi> them; therefore the transient <hi>Principles</hi> more promiscuos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

of these <hi>Vessels,</hi> and so are herein all immersed in a Body of
<hi>Aer.</hi>

the <hi>Proportion</hi> and <hi>Situation</hi> of the <hi>Parts,</hi> whereby the said <hi>Contents</hi>
are with different Facility and Quantity, communicated one to another.
Hence it is, partly, that a <hi>Vine,</hi> or that <hi>Corn,</hi> hath so little <hi>Oyl: sc.</hi>
Because their <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> in proportion with the other <hi>Parts,</hi> are so
<hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Numerous:</hi> in <hi>Corn,</hi> the <hi>Stalk</hi> being also very hollow, and so
becoming as it were, one Great <hi>Aer-Vessel.</hi> For the <hi>Oily</hi> parts of the <hi>Sap,</hi>
are so exceedingly <hi>attenuated</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">P. 2. §. 25, <hi>&amp;</hi> 56.</note> by the <hi>Aery Ferment</hi> contained in

<hi>Spirit,</hi> or mixed therewith, as not, by being collected in any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Body, to be distinguishable from it. And the affinity that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Oils,</hi> especially <hi>Essential,</hi> is manifest: Both are very
inflammable; Both will burn all away; The <hi>Odors,</hi> which we call

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100350:75"/>
duly <hi>Rectified,</hi> will mix as easily together, as <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi> So
that, although <hi>Oyl,</hi> by the separation of its <hi>earthy</hi> and <hi>Saline</hi> parts,
which give it its sensibly <hi>oleous</hi> Body, may not be so far <hi>attenuated,</hi> as to

therewith, as <hi>not to be discerned from it,</hi> as in the forementioned <hi>Plants,</hi>
will be granted.</p>
                  <p>63. §. Hence it is, that the <hi>Lactiferous</hi> standing more remote from
the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> and the <hi>Succiferous</hi> interposing;<note n="a" place="margin">Tab. 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.</note> the <hi>Liquor,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
contained in them, is not so much under the government of the

all <hi>Roots</hi> which are <hi>Milky,</hi> so far as I have observed, have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-proportion
of <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> these being either Fewer or Smaller.</p>
                  <p>64. §. FROM what hath been said,<note place="margin">How the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> are made.</note> we may receive some
information, likewise, of the <hi>Odours, Colours,</hi> and <hi>Tastes</hi> of
<hi>Plants.</hi> And for <hi>Odours,</hi> I suppose, That the chief Matter of them,
is the <hi>Aerial Ferment</hi> contained in the <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi> Not but that
the <hi>other Parts</hi> do also yield their smell; but that <hi>these</hi> yield the
<hi>strongest</hi> and the <hi>best,</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> perceptible in <hi>fresh, undryed</hi> and
<hi>unbruised Plants.</hi> For the <hi>Aer</hi> entring into, and passing through the
<hi>Root,</hi> and carrying a <hi>Tincture,</hi> from the several <hi>Organical</hi> and <hi>Contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
Parts, along with it, and at last entring also the <hi>Concaves</hi> of the
<hi>Aer-Vessels;</hi> it there exists the most <hi>Compounded</hi> and <hi>Volatile Fluid,</hi>
of all others in the <hi>Plant,</hi> and so the fittest matter of <hi>Odour:</hi> and
such an <hi>Odour,</hi> as answers to that of all the <hi>Odorous</hi> parts of the
<hi>Plant.</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">P. 2. §. 24.</note> Wherefore the <hi>Organical Parts,</hi> being well clensed of their
<hi>Contents,</hi> smell not at all; Because the <hi>Principles</hi> hereof are, as hath
been said, so far <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>concentred</hi> together. Hence also the <hi>Contained
Parts</hi> themselves, or any other Bodies, as their <hi>Principles</hi> are any way
more <hi>fixed,</hi> they are less <hi>Odorous:</hi> So is <hi>Rosin,</hi> less than <hi>Turpentine,</hi>
and <hi>Pitch,</hi> than <hi>Tar;</hi> and many the self same Bodies, when they are
<hi>coagulated,</hi> less than when they are <hi>melted.</hi> So also <hi>Musk,</hi> which is
not so liquid as <hi>Civet,</hi> is not so strong; nor <hi>Ambergreece,</hi> as <hi>Musk:</hi>
For although it hath a more excellent smell, than <hi>Musk</hi> hath, yet
yieldeth it not so easily; since it is a more <hi>fixed</hi> Body, and requireth
some <hi>Art</hi> to be opened. Hence also the <hi>Leaves</hi> of many <hi>Plants</hi> lose
their <hi>Odour</hi> upon <hi>rubbing:</hi> Because the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> being thereby bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
all their <hi>contained odorous Fluid</hi> vanisheth at once: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
was only strained gradually through the <hi>Skin.</hi> Yet the <hi>fixed</hi>
Parts themselves, upon drying, are so far altered by the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Aer,</hi>
as to become resoluble, and volatile, and thence odorous.</p>
                  <p>65. §. SO ALSO of their <hi>Colours.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How their <hi>Colours.</hi>
                     </note> As whence the <hi>Colours</hi> of the
<hi>Skins</hi> are varied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For divers of the <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi> together with the
<hi>Parenchymous Parts</hi> successively falling off from the <hi>Barque</hi> into the
<hi>Skin</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">P. 1. c. 2. §. 2, 4.</note> by their proximity to the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Aer,</hi> their <hi>Sulphureous</hi> or
<hi>Oleous Principle</hi> is more or less <hi>resolved,</hi> and so produceth divers <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</hi>
So those <hi>Roots</hi> which turn <hi>purple</hi> any where within, have
usually a <hi>blacker Skin;</hi> the one of those two <hi>Colours</hi> being, by a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
and corruption of parts, easily convertible into the other, as
in <hi>Cumfry, Thistle,</hi> &amp;c, So the <hi>Milk</hi> of <hi>Scorzonera,</hi> contained in
the <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Barque,</hi> upon drying, turneth into a <hi>brown Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour:</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:100350:75"/>
Wherefore the <hi>Skin,</hi> in which there are divers of those <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,</hi>
is of the <hi>same.</hi> So both the <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Skin</hi> of <hi>Lovage</hi> is of a
brownish <hi>yellow.</hi> But <hi>Parsnep</hi> hath a clearer <hi>Sap</hi> in all its <hi>Vessels,</hi> and
a whiter <hi>Skin.</hi> So <hi>Potato's,</hi> being cut traverse, after some time out of
ground, have divers <hi>red</hi> specks up and down where the <hi>Vessels</hi> stand,
and their <hi>Skin</hi> is accordingly <hi>red.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>66. §. The reason, I say of these <hi>Colours,</hi> is the <hi>resolution</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation</hi>
of the <hi>Principles</hi> of the several <hi>Parts,</hi> chiefly, by the <hi>Aer,</hi> and
a <hi>lighter mixture</hi> of them consequent thereupon: whereby the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous</hi>
or <hi>Oyly Parts,</hi> which were before <hi>concentred,</hi> are now more
or less <hi>rampant,</hi> discovering themselves in divers <hi>Colours,</hi> according as
they are diversly mixed with the other <hi>Principles.</hi> Hence these <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours</hi>
are observable, according to the nature of the <hi>Parts wherein</hi>
they <hi>are,</hi> or whereunto they are <hi>adjacent:</hi> So where the <hi>Lympheducts</hi>
doe run, there is a <hi>Red,</hi> or some other <hi>Sulphureous Colour;</hi> the <hi>Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Principles</hi> being, as is said,<note n="a" place="margin">P. 2. §. 21.</note> more copious in these <hi>Vessels;</hi> as
in the <hi>Bark</hi> of <hi>Peony,</hi> the inward parts of <hi>Potato's,</hi> &amp;c. may be
seen. But the <hi>Parenchymous Parts,</hi> where more remote from the said
<hi>Vessels,</hi> they are usually <hi>White,</hi> or but <hi>Yellow:</hi> the <hi>Sulphureous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
of these <hi>Parts,</hi> being, as hath been said, but sparing.<note n="b" place="margin">P. 2. §. 20.</note> The
same is seen in those <hi>Roots</hi> which shew both <hi>Red</hi> and <hi>Yellow:</hi> those
<hi>Parts,</hi> principally, where the <hi>Succiferous Vessels</hi> run, being <hi>Red;</hi> but
those <hi>Parts,</hi> where only the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are mixed with the <hi>Parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,</hi>
being <hi>Yellow;</hi> as in <hi>Patience.</hi> So likewise the <hi>pithy</hi> part of a
<hi>Carrot,</hi> where the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> have very few <hi>Succiferous</hi> mixed with
them, is <hi>Yellow;</hi> but the <hi>Barque,</hi> where the <hi>Succiferous</hi> are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
is <hi>Red.</hi> For the same reason, many <hi>Roots,</hi> which are
<hi>Whiter</hi> in their upper parts, are <hi>Purple</hi> or <hi>Reddish</hi> in their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
as <hi>Avens, Strawberry,</hi> &amp;c. Because those lower parts, having

<hi>Principles</hi> are, thereby, somewhat more <hi>resolved,</hi> and so the <hi>Oleous, ramp</hi>
and spread all over the rest in that <hi>Colour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>67. § And that the <hi>Resolution</hi> of the <hi>Sulphureous</hi> and other <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
is partly effected by the <hi>Aer,</hi> appears, In that, where the <hi>Aer</hi>
hath a free access to the <hi>Succiferous Vessels,</hi> the <hi>Colours</hi> are there,
chiefly produced, or are more conspicuous. So in <hi>Potato's,</hi> where
the <hi>Succiferous Vessels</hi> are either next to the external <hi>Aer,</hi> as in the
<hi>Skin;</hi> or contiguous with the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> as in the <hi>Ring</hi> within the
<hi>Barque;</hi> there, they produce a <hi>Red:</hi> but where more remote from
both, as in the middle of the <hi>Barque,</hi> and Centre of the <hi>Root,</hi>
there they produce none. Hence also it is, that the <hi>Leaves</hi> and
<hi>Flowers</hi> of some <hi>Plants,</hi> as <hi>Bloodwort, Wood-Sorrel, Radish, Jacea,</hi>
&amp;c. although <hi>Green</hi> or <hi>White</hi> in the greatest portion of their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchymous
Part;</hi> yet where the <hi>Succiferous</hi> and <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
they are of <hi>Red, Blue,</hi> and other <hi>Colours;</hi> the <hi>Oleous parts</hi>
of the <hi>one,</hi> being <hi>unlocked</hi> and <hi>opened,</hi> by the <hi>aery</hi> of the <hi>other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>68. §. AND LASTLY,<note place="margin">How their <hi>Tastes.</hi>
                     </note> of their <hi>Tasts.</hi> Most <hi>Roots</hi> which are
<hi>acres</hi> or <hi>bitting,</hi> have a very copious <hi>Parenchyma</hi> in proportion with
the <hi>Succiferous Vessels,</hi> as of <hi>Arum, Dragon,</hi> and others: Because the
<hi>Saline</hi> and other <hi>Principles</hi> are not so much <hi>hot,</hi> by any sufficient
quantity of <hi>Sulphureous,</hi> from those <hi>Vessels,</hi> in which the <hi>Sulphur,</hi>
as is said, is more abundant;<note n="a" place="margin">P. 2. §. 21.</note> but rendred rather <hi>pungent,</hi> from
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100350:76"/>
some <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Aer.</hi> But divers <hi>Umbelliferous Roots,</hi> especially which
abound with <hi>Lactiferous Vessels,</hi> are <hi>hot;</hi> as <hi>Fenil, Lovage, Angelica,</hi>
&amp;c. Yet is it not their <hi>Oyl</hi> alone that makes them <hi>hot,</hi> but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
thereof with the <hi>Saline</hi> Parts: as is manifest, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>Seed</hi> of these <hi>Plants;</hi> wherein, as the <hi>Oyl</hi> is most copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
So being held to a Candle till they burn, constantly <hi>spit;</hi>
which cometh to pass, by the eruption of the <hi>Saline</hi> Parts: and
is the very same effect, with that which followeth upon burning of
<hi>Serum</hi> or <hi>Blood.</hi> And therefore, as these <hi>Seeds</hi> are more <hi>hot,</hi> they
also <hi>spit</hi> the more; So those of <hi>Cumine,</hi> which, though fulsom, yet
are not so <hi>hot, spit</hi> less; <hi>Fenil</hi> and <hi>Dill,</hi> which are <hi>hotter,</hi> more;
there being a greater quantity of <hi>volatile Salt</hi> contained herein.
Hence all <hi>Essential Oyls</hi> are <hi>hot,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>volatile Salt,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
herewith. And some of them will <hi>shoot,</hi> and crystallize as
<hi>Salts</hi> do, as that of <hi>Anise;</hi> which argues a mixture of a considerable
quantity of <hi>volatile Salt.</hi> As also doth the Nature of these <hi>Oyls,</hi> in
being amicable to the <hi>Stomach, Carminative,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Anodyne;
scil.</hi> as they kill some <hi>fetid,</hi> or <hi>corrosive Acid:</hi> for <hi>volatile Salts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
will have the like operation in some cases as these <hi>Oyls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>69. §. Many <hi>Lactiferous Roots,</hi> as <hi>Taraxacum</hi> and others of that
kind, are not so much <hi>hot,</hi> as <hi>bitter.</hi> For although by the <hi>Lactife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Vessels</hi> they are very <hi>Oyly;</hi> yet those <hi>Vessels</hi> being posited in <hi>Rings,</hi>
and not in <hi>Rays,</hi> and having no <hi>Diametral Portions</hi> running through
their <hi>Barque</hi> to the <hi>Aer-Vessels;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 13.</note> the <hi>Acido-Aerial Parts</hi> do hereby, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not <hi>mortifie,</hi> yet so far <hi>refract</hi> the <hi>saline,</hi> lightly <hi>binding up</hi>
the <hi>Oleous</hi> therewith, as to produce a <hi>bitter Taste.</hi> So, many <hi>sweet</hi>
Bodies, upon burning, become <hi>bitter;</hi> the <hi>Acid</hi> Parts, now becoming
<hi>rampant,</hi> and more copiously mixed with the <hi>Oleous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>70. The <hi>Roots,</hi> or other Parts, of many <hi>Umbelliferous Plants,</hi> have
a <hi>sweetish Taste,</hi> as both the <hi>Sweet,</hi> and <hi>Common Chervil;</hi> both the
<hi>Garden,</hi> and <hi>wild Carrot; Parsnep, Fenil,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Saline Principles</hi>

respect to the rest. For by the <hi>Oyly,</hi> the <hi>Saline</hi> is rendred more <hi>smooth</hi>
and amicable; and both being moderate, they are not therefore <hi>hot,</hi>
as in some other <hi>Umbelliferous Roots;</hi> but by the predominion of the
other <hi>Principles,</hi> made <hi>mild.</hi> Hence it is, that <hi>Sugar</hi> it self is <hi>sweet,
scil.</hi> because it is an <hi>Oleous Salt;</hi> as is manifest, from its being highly
<hi>inflammable;</hi> its easie <hi>dissolution</hi> by a moderate, <hi>Fire,</hi> without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of <hi>Water;</hi> and in that, being melted with <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and other <hi>Oily</hi> Bodies, it will <hi>mix</hi> together with them. So also the <hi>Acid
Parts</hi> of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> being <hi>concentred</hi> in the <hi>Salino-sulphureous</hi> of <hi>Lead,</hi>
produce a <hi>Sugar.</hi> Hence <hi>Barley,</hi> which upon <hi>Distillation</hi> or <hi>Decoction</hi>
yeildeth only an <hi>acid;</hi> being turned into <hi>Mault,</hi> becomes <hi>sweet.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
being <hi>steeped, couched,</hi> and so <hi>fermented,</hi> the <hi>oleous</hi> parts are thereby
<hi>unlocked,</hi> and becoming <hi>rampant,</hi> over the other <hi>Principles,</hi> altogether
produce that <hi>Taste.</hi> And the <hi>Bile</hi> it self, which, next to <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi>
consisteth most of <hi>oily</hi> parts, and of many both <hi>saline</hi> and <hi>acid</hi> is a <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-sweet.</hi>
Wherein, as some of the <hi>Saline</hi> and <hi>Acid</hi> parts, smoothed by
the <hi>Oleous,</hi> produce a <hi>Sweet:</hi> So, some of the <hi>Oleous,</hi> impregnated with
the <hi>Saline,</hi> and the <hi>Acid,</hi> doe hereby produce a <hi>Bitter.</hi>

they appear to the naked Eye. And some
others, as by the length. Which having done,

2. §. I SHALL begin where the Work of <hi>Nature</hi> appears less

                           </gap>Vessels;</hi> which in a Slice cut transversly, appear in
very small and dark colour'd <hi>Rings.</hi> The like structure may also be

                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. LET the next <hi>Trunk</hi> be that of <hi>Taraxacum,</hi> or <hi>Dandelion.</hi> In
a <hi>slice</hi> whereof, being cut transversly, is seen next the <hi>Skin,</hi> first, a
simple,<note place="margin">Tab. 18.</note> white, and close <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or <hi>Barque;</hi> made up of <hi>Vesicles;</hi>
but such as are exceeding small; and hardly visible without a <hi>Glass.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. Within This, stand <hi>Milk-Vessels</hi> in seven or eight distinct <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums,</hi>
of different size: each <hi>Colum</hi> being also made up of seven or
eight <hi>Arched Lines.</hi> Betwixt these <hi>Colums,</hi> run as many <hi>Diametral
Portions,</hi> derived from the <hi>Barque,</hi> into or towards the <hi>Pith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. Next within These, stand the <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi> Which are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
divided, by the said <hi>Diametral Portions,</hi> into divers <hi>Arched
Lines.</hi> The <hi>size</hi> of these <hi>Vessels,</hi> as well as their <hi>number,</hi> is small.</p>
                     <p>6. §. Within These, stands the <hi>Pith,</hi> consisting of very small <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicles</hi>
or <hi>Bladders,</hi> as the <hi>Barque.</hi> 'Tis very small, the <hi>Diameter</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
being scarce one <hi>fifth,</hi> of that of the <hi>Pith</hi> of <hi>Borage.</hi> But the
<hi>Barque</hi> of <hi>Borage</hi> is not half so thick as this of <hi>Dandelion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. FOR a Third <hi>Stalk,</hi> we may take that of <hi>Borage;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there is some further Variety. For in a <hi>slice</hi> hereof, cut transversly,
there appears, first a Tough, yet Thin and Transparent <hi>Skin.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this <hi>Skin,</hi> and <hi>Continuous</hi> therewith, there is also a Thin <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Sap-Vessels:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 18.</note>
which, without being crushed in the least, do yeild a <hi>Lympha.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. Next standeth the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Barque.</hi> Which is
made up of a great number of very small <hi>Vesicles</hi> or <hi>Bladders.</hi> Upon
the inner <hi>Verge</hi> of this <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> standeth another <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Sap-Vessels:</hi>
which also yield a <hi>Lympha;</hi> and that different, as is probable, from
the <hi>Lympha</hi> in the utmost <hi>Ring.</hi> Hitherto goes the <hi>Barque.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. Adjacent to the <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi> on the inner <hi>Verge</hi> of
<hi>Barque,</hi> stand the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> on the outer <hi>Verge</hi> of the <hi>Pith.</hi> Not in a
<hi>Ring;</hi> but in several <hi>Parcels;</hi> some <hi>Parcels</hi> or <hi>Conjugations,</hi> in the figure
of little <hi>Specks;</hi> others, in little <hi>Arched Lines,</hi> almost like an V <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant.</hi>
And being viewed in a good <hi>Glass,</hi> there appears to be within
the compass of every larger <hi>Speck or Parcel,</hi> about 20 or 30 <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi>
and within the smallest, about 8 or 10.</p>
                     <p>10. §. The <hi>Pith,</hi> in a well grown <hi>Stalk</hi> of this <hi>Plant;</hi> is always
<hi>hollow.</hi> But originally, it is <hi>entire.</hi> It is likewise wholly made up
of a great number of <hi>Vesicles:</hi> of which, through a <hi>Glass,</hi> some appear
<hi>Pentangular,</hi> others <hi>Sexangular,</hi> and <hi>Septangular.</hi> Most of them are
larger than those of the <hi>Barque;</hi> so as to be plainly visible to a naked
Eye.</p>
                     <p>11. §. A FOURTH <hi>Trunk,</hi> shall be that of <hi>Colewort,</hi> which
seems likewise, to have at least, two Sorts of <hi>Lymphaeducts.</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cut transversly, as the former, we may observe, next the <hi>Skin,</hi> a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100350:80"/>
very close <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> of a darkish Green. Wherewith are mixed
some few <hi>Sap Vessels,</hi> which give it that <hi>Colour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. §. Within This, stands a <hi>scalloped Parenchymous Ring,</hi> or a
<hi>Ring</hi> of many short and slender white <hi>Arches.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 18.</note> Which all round about
the <hi>Barque,</hi> meeting together, run in so many white <hi>Diametral Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
or extream small <hi>Rays,</hi> into the <hi>Pith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13. §. Betwixt these white <hi>Rays,</hi> and next of all to the said white
<hi>Arches,</hi> stand as many small <hi>Parcels</hi> of <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi> like so many little
<hi>Half-Ovals.</hi> Within each of which, is included a white <hi>Parenchyma.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>14. §. On the inner <hi>Verge</hi> of the <hi>Barque,</hi> stands another Sort of
<hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi> in one slender and entire <hi>Ring.</hi> And so far goes the
<hi>Barque.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>15. §. Next within this <hi>Ring</hi> stand the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> in several <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,</hi>
diametrically opposite to the said white <hi>Parenchymous Parcels</hi> next
without the <hi>Sap-Ring.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. §. Last of all, and more within the <hi>Pith,</hi> stand the same kind
of <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi> as those of the <hi>Half-Ovals.</hi> Both these, by small lines,
run one into another; thus, on both sides, hemming in the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi>
and so making altogether, so many little <hi>Pyramids.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>17. §. LET a <hi>Fifth</hi> be that of <hi>Holyoake.</hi> In which, the Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of <hi>Nature,</hi> is still more copious: presenting us, as it is seems, with
Three sorts of <hi>Lymphaeducts;</hi> Of which, two yield a <hi>Thin;</hi> the Third,
a <hi>Thick Lympha.</hi> For being cut, as before, next to the <hi>Skin,</hi> stands the
<hi>Barque;</hi> somewhat close, and, in proportion, <hi>Thick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>18. §. Towards the inner <hi>Verge</hi> hereof, stand one sort of <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi>
postur'd in short <hi>Rays.</hi> These <hi>Vessels</hi> yield a <hi>Mucilage.</hi> And on the
inner <hi>Verge</hi> of the <hi>Barque,</hi> stands a Thin <hi>Ring</hi> of other <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi>
which yield a <hi>thinner Liquor.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 18.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>19. §. Next within the <hi>Barque</hi> stand the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> postur'd like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in short <hi>Rays,</hi> diametrically opposite to those in the <hi>Barque.</hi> In
every <hi>Ray,</hi> there are about twelve or sixteen <hi>Vessels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>20. §. Lastly, and more within the <hi>Pith,</hi> there stand other <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi>
all in very Thin or Slender <hi>Arched-Lines;</hi> thus hemming in the
ral <hi>Parcels</hi> of <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>21. §. FOR a Sixth, I will take that of Wild <hi>Cucumer:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is also found a <hi>Mucilaginous Lympha.</hi> For first of all, next to the
<hi>Skin,</hi> there is a <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Sap-Vessels.</hi> Which <hi>Ring</hi> is also radiated, the
<hi>Rays,</hi> all poynting towards, and most of them terminating on, the
<hi>Skin.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 18.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>22. §. Next of all, there is a thick, and simple <hi>Parenchymous Ring.</hi>
On the inner <hi>Verge</hi> whereof, there are other <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> standing in
<hi>Parcels,</hi> also in a <hi>Ring.</hi> So far goes the <hi>Barque.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>23. §. Next within, stand the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> in as many <hi>Parcels,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
to those of the <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> aforesaid. To which likewise are
adjoyned as many more <hi>Parcels</hi> of <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> within the <hi>Pith,</hi> opposite
to the said <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> within the <hi>Barque.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>24. §. FOR a <hi>Seventh,</hi> we may, choose that of <hi>Scorzonera.</hi> In
which, the <hi>Vessels</hi> are both <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> and <hi>Lactiferous.</hi> All of them,
with the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> in a radiated posture. For first next the outer
Edg of the <hi>Barque,</hi> stand the <hi>Lactiferous,</hi> in little <hi>Specks.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 18.</note> Next to
these, on the inner Edg of the <hi>Barque,</hi> stand the <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> in the
same form.</p>

                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:100350:81"/>
25. §. Hereunto adjacent, on the outer Edg of the <hi>Pith,</hi> stand the
<hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> some in <hi>Specks,</hi> and some in extream short <hi>Lines;</hi> hardly
distinguished, without a very nice Inspection.</p>
                     <p>26. §. Within These, are placed other <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> opposite to
those in the <hi>Barque.</hi> And within these <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> still in the same
radiated Line, run more of the <hi>Milk-Vessels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>27. §. AN EIGHTH, may be that of <hi>Burdock;</hi> Wherein first,
there are a Sort of <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> which stand in <hi>Arched Parcels,</hi> round
the <hi>Trunk,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 18.</note> adjacent to the <hi>Skin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>28. §. Within these, about the middle of the <hi>Barque,</hi> run the
<hi>Milk-Vessels,</hi> in the form of small round <hi>Specks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>29. §. Next to these on the inner Edg of the <hi>Barque</hi> are placed
other <hi>Lymphaeducts.</hi> Which, together with more of the same in the
<hi>Pith,</hi> and the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> betwixt them, stand all in Radiated Lines, of
several Lengths, and all sharpning towards the Centre.</p>
                     <p>30. §. LET the <hi>Ninth,</hi> be that of <hi>Endive:</hi> In which there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
much curious Work.<note place="margin">Tab. 18.</note> Next to the <hi>Skin,</hi> there is, first, a thick and
simple <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> Then there is a kind of <hi>Undulated Ring</hi> of <hi>Milk-Vessels.</hi>
Within which stand a Sort of <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> in several <hi>Parcels;</hi>
some, in <hi>Arched Half-Ovals;</hi> others, in short slender <hi>Rays.</hi> Betwixt
these <hi>Parcels,</hi> many of the <hi>Milk-Vessels</hi> likewise stand.</p>
                     <p>31. §. Next there is an <hi>undulated Ring</hi> of other <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
as in most <hi>Trunks,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Barque</hi> and the <hi>Pith.</hi> Within which,
are the <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi> And within These, more <hi>Sap-Vessels.</hi> Both of them,
in small <hi>Specks,</hi> answerable, or opposite to the <hi>Rays</hi> in the <hi>Barque.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>32. §. I SHALL give also one or two Examples of <hi>Trees,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 18.</note> or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borescent
Plants;</hi> the <hi>Vine</hi> and <hi>Common Sumach.</hi> In a Slice of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
cut transversly, next the <hi>Skin,</hi> there is a Thin <hi>Barque.</hi> In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
part whereof, adjacent to the <hi>Wood,</hi> stand the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Half-Oval Parcels,</hi> opposite to so many Radiated Pieces of the
<hi>Wood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>33. §. The <hi>Wood</hi> is divided into the said Pieces, by as many <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchymous
Rays,</hi> inserted from the <hi>Barque,</hi> and so continuous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
                     <p>34. §. Within these Radiated Pieces of <hi>Wood,</hi> stand the <hi>Aer-Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels;</hi>
the largest of which, especially if held up against the light, are
plainly visible to the bare Eye.</p>
                     <p>35. §. Within the hollow of the <hi>Wood,</hi> stands the <hi>Pith;</hi> in the
young Growths always large. In the utmost <hi>Verge</hi> whereof, adjacent
to the <hi>Wood,</hi> stand a few more <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> of the same Sort with those
in the <hi>Barque.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>36. §. IN A like Slice of <hi>Common Sumach,</hi> contiguous to the hairy
<hi>Skin,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 18.</note> there is a <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Lymphaeducts.</hi> Next to this a Simple <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma.</hi>
Then several <hi>Arched Parcels</hi> of <hi>Lymphaeducts.</hi> Within these, a
<hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Milk-Vessels.</hi> And then a <hi>Ring</hi> of other <hi>Lymphaeducts.</hi> Thus
far the <hi>Barque.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>37. §. Within the <hi>Barque,</hi> stands the <hi>Wood,</hi> divided into several
<hi>Portions,</hi> by the Diametral <hi>Insertions</hi> divided from the <hi>Barque.</hi> In
the Body of the <hi>Wood,</hi> stand the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> very much smaller than in
the <hi>Vine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:100350:81"/>
38. §. The hollow of the <hi>Wood</hi> is filled up with the <hi>Pith.</hi> In
the Circumference of which, stands a <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Lymphaedctus,</hi> of the
same sort with those next to the <hi>Wood</hi> without.</p>
                     <p>39. §. All the <hi>Parts</hi> of these <hi>Trunks,</hi> may, as I have now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
them, be observed without a <hi>Microscope:</hi> excepting the <hi>Bladders</hi>
and number of <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi> Yet Three things are hereunto necessary;
<hi>viz.</hi> a good <hi>Eye,</hi> a clear <hi>Light,</hi> and a <hi>Rasor,</hi> or very keen <hi>Knife,</hi>
wherewith to cut them with a smooth surface, and so, as not to Dislo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the <hi>Parts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>40. §. UPON <hi>Inspection</hi> also by the length, there are some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
common, more or less, to most <hi>Plants,</hi> yet better observable in
some, than in others. As first, the <hi>Reticulation</hi> of the <hi>Vessels,</hi> (formerly
described) not only in the <hi>Wood,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 19.</note> but in the <hi>Barque:</hi> which is evident
in a young <hi>Branch</hi> of <hi>Corin,</hi> upon the very Surface thereof, when some
of the <hi>Vessels</hi> begin to be cast off into the <hi>Skin.</hi> And so, by stripping
off the <hi>Skin,</hi> upon the Surface of the <hi>Wood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>41. §. In cutting by the length, as well as transversly, the young
<hi>Fibres,</hi> which grow within the <hi>Wood</hi> in the Edg of the <hi>Pith,</hi> are also
seen. As likewise the manner of the Derivation of the <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Bud</hi>
from the <hi>Branch</hi> or <hi>Stalk;</hi> as in <hi>Sonchus.</hi> There are also many Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties
in the <hi>Pith,</hi> such as those hereafter mentioned<note n="a" place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> which fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
observation only in cutting by the length.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> NOW proceed to a more particular <hi>Description</hi> of
several <hi>Trunks</hi> and <hi>Branches,</hi> as they appear through
good <hi>Glasses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. §. Now the <hi>Trunk,</hi> or <hi>Branch</hi> of every <hi>Tree,</hi>
hath Three General <hi>Parts</hi> to be described; <hi>sc.</hi> the
<hi>Barque,</hi> the <hi>Wood,</hi> and the <hi>Pith.</hi> That likewise of
every <hi>Herbaceous Plant,</hi> hath either the same Three
<hi>Parts;</hi> or else Three <hi>Parts</hi> Analogous; <hi>sc.</hi> the <hi>Cortical,</hi> the <hi>Lignous,</hi>
and the <hi>Pithy Parts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. The <hi>Barque</hi> consisteth of two <hi>Parts, sc.</hi> the outmost or <hi>Skin,</hi>
and the <hi>Main Body.</hi> The <hi>Skin</hi> is generally composed, in part, of very
small <hi>Vesicles</hi> or <hi>Bladders,</hi> cluster'd together. That is, originally it is
so; but as the <hi>Plant</hi> grows, the <hi>Skin</hi> dries, and the said <hi>Bladders,</hi> do
very much shrink up and disappear.</p>
                     <p>3. §. Amongst these <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Skin,</hi> there are usually inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed
a sort of <hi>Lignous Fibres,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 20.</note> or <hi>Vessels,</hi> which run through the length
of the <hi>Skin;</hi> as in <hi>Mallow, Nettle, Borage, Thistle,</hi> and most <hi>Herbs.</hi> Which
is argued not only from the Toughness of the <hi>Skin</hi> by means of the said
<hi>Vessels;</hi> but in some <hi>Plants,</hi> may be plainly seen, as in <hi>Teasle.</hi> In which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:100350:82"/>
the several <hi>Fibres,</hi> which run by the length of the <hi>Stalk,</hi> are also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
by other smaller ones, which stand transversly.</p>
                     <p>4. §. Whether they are <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> or <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi> is dubious. For,
on the one hand, because they emit no <hi>Sap,</hi> or <hi>bleed</hi> not, and also stand
adjacent to the <hi>Aer;</hi> 'tis probable that they are <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi> On the
other hand, they may be <hi>Sap-Vessels;</hi> notwithstanding that they <hi>bleed</hi>
not: Because the non-emission of <hi>Sap</hi> is not an infallible and concluding
argument of an <hi>Aer-Vessel.</hi> For there are some <hi>Plants</hi> which <hi>bleed</hi> not.
Which yet are furnished with <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi> as certainly as any others
which <hi>bleed.</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">B. 2. P. 1. c. 3. §. 22.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. The <hi>Skin</hi> of the <hi>Trunk</hi> is sometimes visibly porous. But no
where more, than in the better sort of walking <hi>Canes;</hi> where the
<hi>Pores</hi> are so big, as to be visible even to the naked Eye: like to those,
which are observable in several parts of the Ball of the <hi>Hand,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 20.</note> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ends of the <hi>Fingers</hi> and <hi>Toes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. THE <hi>Main Body</hi> of the <hi>Barque</hi> consisteth likewise of two
<hi>Parts,</hi> sc. <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> and <hi>Vessels.</hi> The <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is made up of an
innumerable company of small <hi>Bladders</hi> cluster'd together. Differing
in nothing from those aforesaid in the <hi>Skin;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 22. &amp; Sequent.</note> saving, that they are much
larger; and generally rounder.</p>
                     <p>7. §. This <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Barque</hi> is the same, as to its <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
both in the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Trunk.</hi> Yet as to the <hi>Texture</hi> of its <hi>Parts,</hi>
in the <hi>one,</hi> and in the <hi>other,</hi> there is This observable difference, <hi>viz.</hi>
That in the <hi>Barque</hi> of the <hi>Root,</hi> cut transversly, the said <hi>Parenchyma</hi>
(as hath been shew'd) is usually, more or less, disposed into <hi>Diametral
Rays;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 7, 8, 9.</note> running through the <hi>Barque,</hi> after the same manner, as do the
the <hi>Hour-Lines</hi> through the Margin of the <hi>Dial-plate</hi> of a <hi>Clock</hi> or
<hi>Watch:</hi> as in <hi>Marsh-Mallow, Lovage, Melilot,</hi> and others. Whereas
here in the <hi>Barque</hi> of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> the said <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is rarely thus
disposed into <hi>Dimetral Rays:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 22. &amp; Seq.</note> Nor when it is, are those <hi>Rays</hi> continued
to the Circumference of the <hi>Barque;</hi> as in the <hi>Barque</hi> of the <hi>Root</hi> they
frequently are. So in <hi>Rhus</hi> or <hi>Sumach,</hi> although part of the <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma</hi>
be dispos'd into <hi>Diametral Rays:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 31, 34, &amp;c.</note> yet are those <hi>Rays</hi> extended
not half way through the <hi>Barque.</hi> So also in <hi>Fig-tree, Worm-wood,
Thistle,</hi> and others. What is further observable in the <hi>Texture</hi> of the
<hi>Parenchyma,</hi> I shall shew in the description of the <hi>Pith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. THE <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Barque,</hi> are, as I shall also shew, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifyed
many ways. But there are some Things, wherein, in all Sorts
of <hi>Plants,</hi> they agree. <hi>First,</hi> in standing, most numerously, in or near,
the inner Margin of the <hi>Barque. Secondly,</hi> in being always, and only
<hi>Sap-Vessels.</hi> I have viewed so many, that at least, I can securely affirm
thus much, That if there be any Heteroclital <hi>Plants,</hi> wherein they are
found otherwise, there is not <hi>One,</hi> in <hi>Five Hundred. Thirdly,</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
always <hi>Conjugated</hi> or <hi>Braced</hi> together in the form of <hi>Net-work.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Number and Distances of the <hi>Braces,</hi> are very different: as
I have already shewed in the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Roots.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Chap. 3. Tab. 6.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. THE Properties, whereby the said <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Barque</hi> are
specificated and distinguished one from another, both in the same
<hi>Plant,</hi> and in the several Species of <hi>Plants,</hi> are very many. Which
Properties, are not Accidental, but such as shew the Constant and
Universal Design of <hi>Nature.</hi> All which shall be demonstrated by the
<hi>Description</hi> of several <hi>Quarters</hi> of the <hi>Slices,</hi> of so many Kinds of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100350:82"/>
                        <hi>Branches,</hi> cut Transversly: and by the several <hi>Figures</hi> which represent
them.</p>
                     <p>10. §. FIRST then,<note place="margin">Tab. 22. &amp; Seq.</note> for the <hi>Eleven</hi> first <hi>Quarters,</hi> the <hi>Vessels</hi> of
the <hi>Barque</hi> are only of <hi>Two Kinds.</hi> And these, in the first <hi>Eight,</hi> seem
to be <hi>Roriferous</hi> (described also in the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Roots)</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">P. 1. c. 3. §. 22.</note> and
those which are common to most, if not to all <hi>Plants,</hi> sc. the <hi>Lymphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts.</hi>
Yet in all the <hi>Eight,</hi> they are, in respect both of their <hi>Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and <hi>Position,</hi> very different. So in <hi>Hazel</hi> and <hi>Ash</hi> they are but
few. In <hi>Holly</hi> and <hi>Barberry</hi> more. In <hi>Apple, Pear, Plum, Elm,</hi> still
more numerous. And of those three <hi>Fruits,</hi> in an <hi>Apple,</hi> or <hi>Plum,</hi>
more than in a <hi>Pear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. §. Again, as their <hi>Proportion,</hi> so likewise their <hi>Position</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
For in <hi>Holly,</hi> the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> or inner <hi>Vessels</hi> next to the <hi>Wood,</hi>
stand in <hi>Rays.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 22, 23, 24.</note> Yet so numerous and close together, as to make one
Entire <hi>Ring.</hi> In <hi>Hazel,</hi> they stand more in Oblong <hi>Parcels.</hi> In <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,</hi>
they stand likewise in <hi>Parcels,</hi> but they are so many <hi>Half-Ovals,</hi>
The utmost <hi>Vessels</hi> or <hi>Roriferous</hi> of all Three, make a <hi>Ring.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. §. Again, in <hi>Apple, Pear,</hi> and <hi>Plum,</hi> the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> are <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 25, to 28.</note>
The <hi>Roriferous</hi> are neither <hi>Radiated,</hi> nor make an <hi>entire Ring;</hi>
but stand in <hi>Peripherial Parcels.</hi> Much after the same manner, they
also stand in <hi>Elm.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 29.</note> In <hi>Ash,</hi> the <hi>Vessels</hi> make Two <hi>Rings;</hi> but neither
of them <hi>Radiated:</hi> the inmost <hi>Ring</hi> or <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> consisting of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
Parcels,</hi> and the utmost or <hi>Roriferous Vessels,</hi> of <hi>Round</hi> ones.
And whereas in all the foregoing, the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> are still contiguous
to the <hi>Wood;</hi> and the <hi>Roriferous</hi> more or less, distant from the <hi>Skin:</hi>
here, on the contrary, the former are distant from the <hi>Wood,</hi> and the
latter contiguous to the <hi>Skin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13. §. And that these <hi>Vessels</hi> in each <hi>Barque</hi> of the said Eight <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
are of Two distinct Kinds, seems evident, as from some other reasons,
so from hence; In that their <hi>Positions</hi> are altogether Heterogeneous:
Yet in both Constant, Regular and Uniform. I say, there seems to be
no Reason, why the self <hi>same Kind</hi> or Species of <hi>Vessels,</hi> should have
a different, yea a contrary <hi>Position</hi> in one and the same <hi>Plant;</hi> and that
Contrariety, not <hi>Accidental,</hi> but <hi>Regular</hi> and <hi>Constant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>14. §. FOR the <hi>Three</hi> next <hi>Quarters</hi> sc. the <hi>Ninth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 30, 31, 32.</note> 
                        <hi>Tenth</hi> and
<hi>Eleventh,</hi> the <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Barque</hi> are also different in <hi>Number, Position,
Size</hi> and <hi>Kind.</hi> In <hi>Pine,</hi> which is the <hi>Eleventh,</hi> they are fewer. In
<hi>Walnut</hi> the <hi>Ninth,</hi> more. In <hi>Fig,</hi> the <hi>Tenth,</hi> most numerous.</p>
                     <p>15. §. So for their <hi>Position.</hi> In <hi>Pine,</hi> the inmost make a <hi>Radiated
Ring.</hi> The utmost stand <hi>stragling</hi> up and down, without any certain
order. In <hi>Wallnut</hi> the inmost make also a <hi>Radiated Ring;</hi> The ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
make a Double <hi>Ring;</hi> not <hi>Radiated,</hi> but of <hi>Round Parcels.</hi>
In <hi>Fig,</hi> the inmost make also a <hi>Radiated Ring.</hi> But the utmost make
a <hi>Double</hi> and sometimes <hi>Treble Ring,</hi> not of <hi>Radiated,</hi> nor <hi>Round,</hi> but
<hi>Arched Parcels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. §. Thirdly, they are also different in <hi>Kind.</hi> Those, I think,
of the two former, <hi>Wallnut</hi> and <hi>Fig,</hi> are thus different: those certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of the <hi>Fig,</hi> are so; being <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> and <hi>Lacteals.</hi> The <hi>Lymphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts</hi>
make the inmost <hi>Radiated Ring.</hi> The outmost which make the
other <hi>Rings</hi> in <hi>Arched Parcels,</hi> are the <hi>Lactifers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>17. §. That they are distinct <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Vessels,</hi> is evident for two
Reasons. <hi>First,</hi> from their <hi>Position</hi> in the <hi>Barque;</hi> which is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100350:83"/>
different, as hath been said. <hi>Secondly,</hi> from the most apparent
Diversity of the <hi>Liquors</hi> or <hi>Saps,</hi> which they contain, and which, upon
cutting the <hi>Branch</hi> transversly, do distinctly <hi>Bleed</hi> from them. Which
is one way, whereby we do distinguish the <hi>Vessels</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi> themselves.
As in the <hi>Liver,</hi> it were hard to say, which is a <hi>Blood-Vessel,</hi> and which
is a <hi>Bile-Vessel,</hi> where they are very small, if it were not for the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi>
of them both.</p>
                     <p>18. §. Those in the <hi>Barque</hi> of <hi>Pine,</hi> are likewise of Two <hi>Kinds.</hi>
The inmost are <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> as in the two former. The utmost are
not <hi>Milk-Vessels,</hi> but <hi>Gum-Vessels,</hi> or <hi>Resiniferous;</hi> which stand strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and singly, about the midle of the <hi>Barque.</hi> Out of these <hi>Vessels</hi>
all the clear <hi>Turpentine,</hi> that drops from the <hi>Tree,</hi> doth issue.</p>
                     <p>19. §. Few, but very great. So that besides the difference of their
<hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Position,</hi> and of the <hi>Liquors</hi> which they contain, and <hi>Bleed;</hi>
there is yet a Fourth, and that is, their <hi>Size.</hi> Most of these <hi>Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Vessels,</hi> being of so wide a <hi>bore,</hi> as to be apparent to the naked Eye:
and, through a good <hi>Glass,</hi> above ⅓<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of an Inch in Diametre.
Whereas that of the <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> can hardly be discovered by the best
<hi>Microscope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>20. §. The same <hi>Turpentine Vessels</hi> of <hi>Pine,</hi> are likewise remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
bigger, not only than the <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> but many times, than the
<hi>Milk-Vessels</hi> themselves: as those of the <hi>Fig,</hi> which, in comparison, are
exceeding small; every <hi>Arch,</hi> not being a <hi>single Vessel,</hi> but a <hi>Parcel</hi> or
<hi>Cluster</hi> of <hi>Vessels;</hi> Whereas one single <hi>Gum-Vessel</hi> in <hi>Pine,</hi> is sometimes
as big as two whole <hi>Arched Clusters,</hi> that is, as some Scores of the <hi>Milk
Vessels</hi> in a <hi>Fig-tree.</hi> And the said <hi>Gum-Vessels</hi> of <hi>Pine,</hi> being compared
with the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> of the same <hi>Tree,</hi> one <hi>Gum-Vessel,</hi> by a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
estimate, may be reckoned <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four hundred</hi> times <hi>wider</hi> than
a <hi>Lymphaeduct.</hi> The like prodigious difference may be observed in the
<hi>Size</hi> of the several <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Vessels</hi> of many other <hi>Plants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>21. §. THE <hi>Three</hi> next <hi>Quarters</hi> of <hi>Branches,</hi> are of <hi>Oak, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sumach,</hi> and <hi>Common Wormwood.</hi> In the <hi>Barque-Vessels</hi> whereof,
there is observable some farther Variety. For in all or in most of the
above named, there are only Two <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Barque.</hi> But
in Each of these, there are, at least, Three <hi>Kinds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>22. §. And first, in that of <hi>Oak</hi> there are <hi>Lymphaeducts, Rorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi>
and a Sort of <hi>Resiniferous.</hi> The inmost or <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> make a
<hi>Radiated Ring,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 33.</note> contiguous to the <hi>Wood.</hi> The utmost or the <hi>Rorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi>
make also a <hi>Ring,</hi> but not <hi>Radiated.</hi> Those which are a sort of
<hi>Rosin-Vessels,</hi> stand in Round <hi>Parcels;</hi> the greater <hi>Parcels</hi> betwixt the
Two <hi>Rings</hi> of <hi>Roriferous</hi> and <hi>Lymphaeducts;</hi> and the lesser, betwixt
the <hi>Roriferous</hi> and the <hi>Skin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>23. §. That these last are different <hi>Vessels</hi> from both the other, seems
evident, from the difference of their <hi>Position,</hi> as aforesaid. And that
they are a sort of <hi>Resiniferous,</hi> is argued from hence; In that, not
only <hi>Galls</hi> are very full of <hi>Rosin,</hi> but that the <hi>Barque</hi> of <hi>Oak</hi> it self is
also somewhat <hi>Resinous.</hi> For the conveyance of whose <hi>Resinous</hi> parts, it
is most unlikely that any other <hi>Vessels</hi> should subserve, but a peculiar
<hi>Kind;</hi> which may therefore be properly called <hi>Resiniferous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>24. §. The next is a <hi>Branch</hi> of <hi>Common Sumach.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 34.</note> In the <hi>Barque</hi>
whereof, there are likewise Three <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Vessels.</hi> First of all, there
is a thick <hi>Radiated Ring</hi> of <hi>Lymphaeducts;</hi> standing on the inner <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:100350:83"/>
of the <hi>Barque,</hi> contiguous with the <hi>Wood.</hi> These <hi>Vessels</hi> exhibit
their <hi>Lympha</hi> very apparently. A second kind of <hi>Vessels,</hi> sc. <hi>Roriferous,</hi>
are situate towards the outer <hi>Margin</hi> of the <hi>Barque,</hi> and are composed
into distinct <hi>Arched Parcels,</hi> all standing in a <hi>Ring.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>25. §. Betwixt these Two <hi>Kinds</hi> stand the <hi>Milk-Vessels.</hi> Every
single <hi>Milk-Vessel</hi> being <hi>empaled</hi> or hemmed in with an <hi>Arch</hi> of <hi>Rorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</hi>
The <hi>Milk-Vessels</hi> are extraordinary large, almost as the <hi>Gum-Vessels</hi>
of <hi>Pine;</hi> so as distinctly to be observed without a <hi>Microscope;</hi>
after they are evacuated of their <hi>Milk;</hi> and without difficulty will
admit a <hi>Virginal Wyer;</hi> being two or three hundred times as big as a
<hi>Lymphaeduct.</hi> Besides these Three sorts of <hi>Vessels,</hi> there is also a <hi>Ring,</hi>
adjacent to the <hi>Skin;</hi> which seems to be another sort of <hi>Roriferous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>26. §. The Last,<note place="margin">Tab. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> is a <hi>Branch</hi> of <hi>Common Wormwood.</hi> In the
<hi>Barque</hi> whereof, there are likewise Three <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Vessels.</hi> First of
all, there is a thin <hi>Radiated Ring</hi> of <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> contiguous with the
<hi>Wood</hi> or on the inner <hi>Margin</hi> of the <hi>Barque.</hi> Yet the <hi>Ring</hi> is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
but made up of several <hi>Parcels;</hi> which are intercepted by as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Parenchymous</hi> inserted into the <hi>Pith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>27. §. A Second Sort of <hi>Vessels,</hi> which seem to be <hi>Roriferous,</hi> are
situate about the middle of the <hi>Barque:</hi> and are composed into <hi>Arched
Parcels,</hi> which likewise stand all even in a <hi>Ring.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>28. §. Beyond these <hi>Arches,</hi> and towards the outer <hi>Margin</hi> of the
<hi>Barque,</hi> stand a Third Sort of <hi>Vessels.</hi> Different from the <hi>Milk-Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi>
in <hi>Sumach,</hi> both as to their <hi>Situation, Size</hi> and <hi>Content.</hi> For in
<hi>Sumach,</hi> the <hi>Milk-Vessels</hi> stand within the <hi>Arched Lymphaeducts:</hi> whereas
these in <hi>Wormwood,</hi> stand without them. Likewise, being the <hi>Vessels</hi>
of an <hi>Herb,</hi> they are far less; <hi>sc.</hi> about the compass or width of a small
<hi>Wheat-Straw.</hi> Their <hi>Content,</hi> is not a <hi>Milk,</hi> but a <hi>liquid,</hi> most <hi>Oleous</hi>
and <hi>viscid Gum.</hi> Or which, for its pleasant <hi>Flavour</hi> may be called an
<hi>Aromatick Balsom.</hi> For it perfectly giveth whatever is in the <hi>Smell</hi>
and <hi>Taste</hi> of <hi>Wormwood:</hi> being the <hi>Essence</hi> of the whole <hi>Plant,</hi> which
nature treasureth up in these <hi>Vessels.</hi> So that they are, in all respects,
analogous to the <hi>Turpentine Vessels</hi> in <hi>Pine.</hi> There are divers other
<hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Trees,</hi> which in the like <hi>Vessels,</hi> contain a <hi>Turpentine,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Aromatical Balsom;</hi> as <hi>Angelica, Helenium</hi> and others; the <hi>Vessels</hi>
being so very large, that they may be easily traced with a knife, in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
by the length of a <hi>Branch</hi> or <hi>Saltk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>29. §. Whether in some <hi>Plants,</hi> there are not more <hi>Sorts</hi> of <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,</hi>
in the <hi>Barque,</hi> than have been now mentioned, I cannot say:
Though we have not much reason to doubt of it. Because we see,
there is so great variety in the <hi>Viscera</hi> of <hi>Animals.</hi> For what the
<hi>Viscera</hi> are in <hi>Animals;</hi> the <hi>Vessels</hi> themselves are in <hi>Plants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>30. §. CONCERNING the <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Texture</hi> of the <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi>
there are some things, which though they are best observed in the
<hi>Wood,</hi> yet in regard I am now describing the said <hi>Vessels,</hi> I shall here
therefore add. I have already said, and shewed, in the former <hi>Books,</hi>
That the <hi>Lignous</hi> and <hi>Towy Parts</hi> of all <hi>Plants,</hi> are <hi>Tubulary.</hi> And
that the <hi>Lympha</hi> is conveyed, by the length of a <hi>Plant,</hi> through an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
company of small <hi>Tubes</hi> or <hi>Pipes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>31. §. The <hi>Question</hi> may be yet further put: If the <hi>Towy Parts</hi> of
the <hi>Barque</hi> are made of <hi>Tubes,</hi> What are these <hi>Tubes</hi> themselves made
up of? <hi>I answer,</hi> That these <hi>Tubes</hi> or <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> are not only
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100350:84"/>
themselves <hi>Organical;</hi> but their very <hi>Sides</hi> also, seem to be composed
of other <hi>Parts,</hi> which are <hi>Organical, sc.</hi> of <hi>Lignous</hi> or <hi>Towy Fibres.</hi>
Which <hi>Fibres,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 40.</note> standing close or contiguous in a round <hi>Figure,</hi> they
make one <hi>Tubulary Body,</hi> which I call the <hi>Lymphaeduct</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi> And
it is probable, That these <hi>Fibres</hi> themselves, are also <hi>Tubulary.</hi> That
is, that a <hi>Lymphaeduct,</hi> is a small <hi>Tube,</hi> made up or composed of
other, yet much smaller <hi>Tubes,</hi> set round together in a <hi>Cylindrick Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</hi>
As if we should imagine a company of <hi>Straws,</hi> which are so
many small <hi>Pipes,</hi> to be joyned and set round together, so as to make
another greater <hi>Pipe,</hi> answerable to a <hi>hollow Cane.</hi> The <hi>Cane,</hi> I say,
is as the <hi>Lymphaeduct;</hi> and the <hi>Straws</hi> are as the <hi>Fibres</hi> whereof it is
composed. By which also appears, the admirable smallness of these
<hi>Fibres.</hi> For there are some <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> which may be reckoned fifty
times smaller than a <hi>Horse-Hair.</hi> Allowing therefore but Twenty of
the aforesaid <hi>Fibres</hi> to make a <hi>Thred</hi> so big as one <hi>Lymphaeduct;</hi> then
one of the said <hi>Fibres,</hi> must be a Thousand times smaller than a <hi>Horse-Hair.</hi>
That these <hi>Fibres,</hi> whereof the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> are made, are
themselves made up of other <hi>Fibres,</hi> is not altogether improbable.</p>
                     <p>32. §. These <hi>Fibres,</hi> although parallel; yet are they not <hi>coalescent,</hi>
but only contiguous; being contained together in a <hi>Tubulary Figure,</hi>
by the We<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tage of the <hi>Cortical Fibres,</hi> as in <hi>Chapter</hi> the <hi>Fourth</hi> will
better be understood.</p>
                     <p>33. §. The first notice I took of the <hi>Composition</hi> and <hi>Texture</hi> of
these <hi>Vessels,</hi> so far as the best <hi>Glasses</hi> yet known, will admit; was in
a very <hi>white</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> piece of <hi>Ash-wood</hi> torn, with some care, by the
length of the <hi>Tree,</hi> and objected to a proper <hi>Light.</hi> They seem also
sometimes discernable in some other <hi>clear Woods,</hi> as in very <hi>white Fir,
&amp;c.</hi> And having formerly demonstrated, that the <hi>Lignous Part</hi> of a
<hi>Plant,</hi> is annually made or augmented out of the inner part of the
<hi>Barque,</hi> wherein the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> always stand: we may reasonably
suppose the same <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> to have the like Conformation in the
<hi>Barque,</hi> as in the <hi>Wood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>34. §. And I am the rather induced to believe, that I am not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in this Description, upon these two Considerations. <hi>First,</hi> that
herein the Analogy betwixt the <hi>Vessels</hi> of an <hi>Animal</hi> and a <hi>Plant,</hi> is the
more clear and proper. For as the <hi>Sanguineous Vessels</hi> in an <hi>Animal</hi>
are composed of a number of <hi>Fibres,</hi> set round, in a <hi>Tubulary Figure,</hi>
together: so are these <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> of a <hi>Plant. Secondly,</hi> in that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
there is a more genuine respondence betwixt these, and the other
<hi>Vessels</hi> of a <hi>Plant</hi> it self; <hi>sc,</hi> the <hi>Aer-Vessels;</hi> which are made up of a
certain number of <hi>Round Fibres,</hi> standing collaterally, or side to side
as I have already observed in the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Roots.</hi> So that it is the
less strange, that the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> should be made up of <hi>Fibres,</hi> since
the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are evidently so made. Only with this difference, that
whereas in the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> the <hi>Fibres</hi> are postured or continued <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally:</hi>
here, in the <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> they stand and are continued only
in <hi>straight Lines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>35. §. THE STRUCTURE of the <hi>Lactiferous</hi> and <hi>Gum-Vessels,</hi> which
have a very ample <hi>Bore,</hi> is more apparent. And, by the best <hi>Glasses</hi>
I have yet used,<note place="margin">Tab. 20.</note> they seem to be made, chiefly, by the Constipation
of the <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Barque.</hi> That is to say, That they are so many
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100350:84"/>
                        <hi>Chanels,</hi> not made or bounded by any walls or sides proper to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as a <hi>Quil</hi> thrust into a <hi>Cork,</hi> and as the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are in the
<hi>Wood:</hi> but only by the <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma;</hi> which are so
postured and crouded up together, as to leave certain <hi>Cilyndrick Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
which are continued by the length of the <hi>Barque.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>36. §. One difference betwixt the <hi>Vessels</hi> or <hi>Chanels</hi> now describ'd,
and the Tubulary <hi>Hollows</hi> and other <hi>Apertures</hi> in the <hi>Pith,</hi> is this;
That these never exist originally with the <hi>Pith;</hi> but are so many <hi>Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
supervening to it in its Growth. Caused, partly, by the Stretch or
Tenter it suffers from the Dilatation of the <hi>Wood:</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">B. 1. c. 3. §. 22, &amp; 23.</note> and partly, the
drying, and so the Shrinking up of its <hi>Bladders,</hi> and of the <hi>Fibres</hi>
whereof they are composed. Whereas the said <hi>Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Barque,</hi>
are many of them originally formed therewith. And those which are
<hi>post-nate,</hi> not made by any <hi>Rupture,</hi> but only such a Disposition of
the <hi>Parenchymous Fibres,</hi> and Constipation of the <hi>Bladders,</hi> as is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
convenient.</p>
                     <p>37. §. In paring the <hi>Barque</hi> of a <hi>Branch</hi> of <hi>Pine, Sumach,</hi> &amp;c. they
appear, neither <hi>parallel,</hi> nor any where <hi>Inosculated:</hi> but run, with
some little obliquities, distinct one from another, through the length
of the <hi>Branch:</hi> and so, we may believe, through the length of the
<hi>Tree.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE next general <hi>Part</hi> of a <hi>Branch,</hi> is the <hi>Wood;</hi>
which lyeth betwixt the <hi>Barque</hi> and the <hi>Pith.</hi>
And this likewise evermore consisteth of Two
General <hi>Parts, sc.</hi> of a <hi>Parenchymous Part,</hi> and
that more properly called <hi>Lignous.</hi> The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchymous
Part</hi> of the <hi>Wood,</hi> though much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versifyed,
yet in the <hi>Trunks</hi> of all <hi>Trees</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
hath this property, To be disposed into
many <hi>Rays,</hi> or <hi>Diametral Insertions,</hi> running be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
so many <hi>Lignous Portions,</hi> from the <hi>Barque</hi> to the <hi>Pith:</hi> as in
any of the <hi>Quarters</hi> here before us may appear.</p>
                     <p>2. §. But these <hi>Insertions</hi> are much diversifyed, according to the
several <hi>Sorts</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 22, <hi>to</hi> 35.</note> So in <hi>Barberry, Ash, Pine, Worm-wood,</hi> they
are less numerous. In <hi>Elm, Wallnut, Fig, Sumach,</hi> they are more.
And in <hi>Holly, Pear, Plum, Apple, Oak, Hazel,</hi> are most numerous.</p>
                     <p>3. §. The same <hi>Insertions,</hi> in <hi>Barberry, Wormwood,</hi> and some in
<hi>Oak,</hi> are very Thick. In <hi>Pine, Fig, Ash,</hi> of a middle <hi>Size.</hi> In <hi>Pear,
Holly,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ibid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> and most of them in <hi>Oak,</hi> are exceeding Small. Again, in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,
Elm, Ash, Sumach, Fig,</hi> they are of an Equal <hi>Size.</hi> In <hi>Holly,
Hazel, Pear, Plum, Oak,</hi> they are very Unequal: some of those in
<hi>Holly,</hi> being <hi>Four</hi> or <hi>Five</hi> times thicker than the rest; in <hi>Plum, Six</hi>
or <hi>seven</hi> times; and in <hi>Oak, Ten</hi> times at least.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:100350:85"/>
4. §. In some <hi>Plants,</hi> they are Equidistant; in others, not: in
some, the Great ones are Equidistant; in others, the Lesser; in others,
both; in some, neither. Which <hi>Varieties</hi> are not accidental; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
to the <hi>Species</hi> in which they are severally found.</p>
                     <p>5. §. They are not always visibly continued from the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the Centre of the <hi>Wood:</hi> but in some <hi>Branches,</hi> as of <hi>Sumach;</hi>
and in most <hi>Trunks</hi> of many years growth, declining, in some places,
under or over,<note place="margin">Tab. 34.</note> from a Level, are thereby, upon a Transverse Section,
in part cut away.</p>
                     <p>6. §. They have yet one more Diversity, which is, That in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the aforesaid <hi>Branches,</hi> they run not only through the <hi>Wood;</hi>
but also shoot out beyond it, into some <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Barque,</hi> as in
<hi>Elm,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 28, 34, 35.</note> 
                        <hi>Sumach, Wormwood,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas in <hi>Pine,</hi> and some of the
rest they either keep not distinct from the other parts of the <hi>Parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
of the <hi>Barque;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 32.</note> or are so small, as not to be distinguished there
form.</p>
                     <p>7. §. The <hi>Texture</hi> likewise of these <hi>Insertions</hi> is somewhat various.
For in <hi>Wormwood,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 35.</note> and most <hi>Herbs,</hi> they are manifestly composed of
small <hi>Bladders:</hi> differing in nothing from those of the <hi>Barque</hi> or <hi>Pith,</hi>
saving, in their being much less. Yet in <hi>Herbs,</hi> they are much larger
than they are in <hi>Trees.</hi> And in many <hi>Trees,</hi> as <hi>Apple, Pear, Plum, Pine,</hi>
&amp;c. they are either quite lost,<note place="margin">Tab. 36, 37.</note> or so squeezed and pressed together
by the hard <hi>Wood</hi> standing on both sides, as to be almost undiscernable.</p>
                     <p>8. §. So that although the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Barque</hi> or <hi>Pith,</hi> and
the <hi>Insertions</hi> in the <hi>Wood,</hi> are of the same <hi>Specifick</hi> Nature or Substance:
yet there is this difference betwixt them; That the <hi>Fibres</hi> of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
are so Netted together, as to leave several round Vacuities; or
to make a great many little <hi>Bladders,</hi> whereas, in the latter, they are
usually so far crowded up, as to run (as when a Net is stretched out)
like a <hi>Skein</hi> of <hi>Parallel Threds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. Of these <hi>Insertions</hi> in the <hi>Wood,</hi> it is futher observable, That
they do not only run betwixt the <hi>Lignous Portions;</hi> but that many of
their <hi>Fibres</hi> are likewise all along distributed to the several <hi>Fibres,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 40.</note> of
which the <hi>Lignous Portions</hi> consist, and are interwoven with them; both
together thus making a piece of <hi>Linsy-Woolsy Work,</hi> or like many other
<hi>Manufactures</hi> in which the <hi>Warp</hi> and the <hi>Woof</hi> are of different Sorts
of <hi>Stuff:</hi> as in the end of the <hi>Fourth Chapter</hi> is further explained.</p>
                     <p>10. §. THE WOOD is likewise compounded of Two Sorts of
<hi>Bodies;</hi> That which is strictly <hi>Woody;</hi> and the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> mixed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
The true <hi>Wood</hi> is nothing else but a mass of antiquated <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeducts,
viz.</hi> those which were originally placed on the inner Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
of the <hi>Barque.</hi> For in that place, there grows, every year, a new
<hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Lymphaeducts.</hi> Which losing its original softness by degrees,
at the latter end of the year, is turned into a dry and hard <hi>Ring</hi> of
perfect <hi>Wood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. §. So that every year, the <hi>Barque</hi> of a <hi>Tree</hi> is divided into
Two Parts, and distributed two <hi>contrary</hi> ways. The outer Part falleth
off towards the <hi>Skin;</hi> and at length becomes the <hi>Skin</hi> it self. In like
manner, as hath been observed of the <hi>Skin</hi> of the <hi>Root.</hi> Or as the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticula</hi>
in <hi>Animals,</hi> is but the efflorescence of the <hi>Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>is.</hi> I say, that the
elder <hi>Skin</hi> of a <hi>Tree,</hi> is not originally made a <hi>Skin;</hi> but was once,
some of the <hi>midle</hi> part of the <hi>Barque</hi> it self, which is annually cast off,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100350:85"/>
and dryed into a <hi>Skin:</hi> even as the very <hi>Skin</hi> of an <hi>Adder,</hi> upon the
gradual generation of a new one underneath, in time, becomes a <hi>Slough.</hi>
The inmost portion of the <hi>Barque,</hi> is annually distributed and added to
the <hi>Wood:</hi> the <hi>Parenchymous Part</hi> thereof making a new addition to
the <hi>Insertions</hi> within the <hi>Wood;</hi> and the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> a new addition
to the <hi>Lignous pieces</hi> betwixt which the <hi>Insertions</hi> stand. So that a
<hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> in the <hi>Barque</hi> this year, will be a <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Wood</hi>
the next; and so another <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> and of <hi>Wood,</hi> successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Tab. 25. 24, 34, 28.</note>
from year to year. So the <hi>Table,</hi> for an <hi>Apple-Branch,</hi> sheweth a
quarter of a <hi>Slice</hi> of a <hi>Branch</hi> cut transversly, of Three years growth:
That of <hi>Barbery,</hi> of Two; That of <hi>Sumach,</hi> of One only; That of
<hi>Elm,</hi> of Five.</p>
                     <p>12. §. Hereby two things may be the better noted. First, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt the degrees of the <hi>annual</hi> growths of several <hi>Trees:</hi> three
years growth in an <hi>Oak,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 33. 28.</note> being as thick as five in an <hi>Elm.</hi> Secondly,
the difference betwixt the <hi>Annual</hi> growths of the <hi>Same Tree;</hi> being
not of a constant proportion, but varying in thickness, as it should seem,
according to the <hi>season</hi> of the year: whereby it may appear, what
<hi>season,</hi> or kind of year, doth most of all favour, the latitudinal growth,
or the <hi>thickening</hi> of any <hi>Tree.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13. §. The <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> thus antiquated or turned into <hi>Wood,</hi> do
rarely, if ever, <hi>Bleed:</hi> but only transmit a kind of <hi>Dewy</hi> or <hi>Vaporous Sap.</hi>
And some of them, as in the <hi>Heart</hi> of some <hi>Trees,</hi> it is probable, That
they transmit not any <hi>Sap,</hi> either in the form of a <hi>Liquor,</hi> or a <hi>Vapour:</hi>
and so being gradually deprived of their <hi>Watery Parts,</hi> become the <hi>Heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>14. §. There is this further variety in the <hi>Wood;</hi> represented in
<hi>Walnut, Fig</hi> and <hi>Oak.</hi> That some certain parcels hereof, make either
several small and white <hi>Rings,</hi> as in <hi>Oak;</hi> or else divers white and crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Parcels,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 30, 31, 33.</note> transverse to the <hi>Insertions,</hi> as in <hi>Wallnut</hi> and <hi>Fig.</hi> For it
seemeth, that, at least, in many <hi>Trees,</hi> some portion of all the <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi>
in the <hi>Barque,</hi> are not only annually distributed to the <hi>Wood,</hi> but
do likewise therein retain the same, or somewhat like <hi>Position,</hi> which
they originally had in the <hi>Barque.</hi> So that as all those bigger and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Portions of the <hi>Wood,</hi> were originally, the <hi>Radiated Lymphaeducts</hi> of
the <hi>Barque:</hi> so the little white <hi>Circles,</hi> or <hi>Parcels</hi> of <hi>Circles,</hi> in the same
<hi>Wood,</hi> were originally another sort of <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Barque, sc.</hi>
those which have a circular Position therein.</p>
                     <p>15. §. In the <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Fir, Pine,</hi> and others of the same <hi>Kindred,</hi>
there are some few <hi>Turpentine-Vessels</hi> scattered up and down the <hi>Wood;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 32.</note>
and represented by the larger Black Spots. Which <hi>Vessels</hi> are <hi>eadem nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero,</hi>
the self same, which did once appertain to the <hi>Barque;</hi> and do
even here also in the <hi>Wood,</hi> contain and yield a liquid <hi>Turpentine.</hi>
Only, being pinched up by the <hi>Wood,</hi> they are become much smaller
<hi>Pipes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. §. THE <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> with the <hi>Insertions,</hi> and true <hi>Wood,</hi> alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
make up That, which is commonly called, The <hi>Wood</hi> of a <hi>Tree.</hi>
The <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> I so call, not in that they never contain any <hi>Liquor;</hi>
but, because all the principal time of the growth of a <hi>Plant,</hi> when the
<hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Barque</hi> are filled with <hi>Liquor,</hi> these are filled only with a
<hi>Vegetable Aer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>17. §. In almost all <hi>Plants,</hi> not one in some hundreds excepted,
this is proper to the <hi>Aer-Vessels;</hi> To have a much more ample <hi>Bore</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:100350:86"/>
than any other in the <hi>Wood.</hi> In the <hi>Wood,</hi> I say; for in the <hi>Barque,</hi>
there are many <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> bigger than the biggest <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> that be.</p>
                     <p>18. §. The Varities hereof are very many; in respect both of their
<hi>Number, Size,</hi> and <hi>Position;</hi> being, as to these, the same, in no two
<hi>Sorts</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> whatsoever. First in respect of their <hi>Number.</hi> So in
<hi>Hazel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 23, 25, 26. 22, 24, 27. 29, 30, 33. 32.</note> 
                        <hi>Apple, Pear,</hi> they are very numerous; but in different degrees:
and are represented in the <hi>Figures</hi> already referred to, by all the black
spots in the <hi>Wood.</hi> In <hi>Holly, Plum, Barberry</hi> somewhat numerous. In
<hi>Oak, Ash, Walnut</hi> fewer. In <hi>Pine,</hi> and others of that <hi>Kindred,</hi> very
few; <hi>sc.</hi> fewer than in any other kind of <hi>Plant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>19. §. Secondly, in respect of their <hi>Size;</hi> which from the first or
greatest, to the least, may be computed easily to about Twenty Degrees.
Thus, many of those in <hi>Elm, Ash, Wallnut, Fig, Oak,</hi> are very large. In
<hi>Barberry,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 28, 33. 22, 26.</note> 
                        <hi>Plum,</hi> not so large. In <hi>Hazel Sumach,</hi> smaller. In <hi>Holly,
Pear,</hi> of a still smaller <hi>Size.</hi> So that many of those in <hi>Elm,</hi> or <hi>Oak,</hi>
are Twenty times bigger, than those in <hi>Holly</hi> or <hi>Pear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>20. §. In an ordinary joynted <hi>Cane,</hi> they are so wide, that if you
take one a yard, or a yard and ½ long, and putting one end into a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin
of Water, you blow strongly at the other; your Breath will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
pass, through the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> the length of the <hi>Cane,</hi> so as to
raise up the Water into a great many <hi>Bubbles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>21. §. And as they have a different Size in divers Kinds of <hi>Plants;</hi>
so likewise, according to the place where they stand, in the self same.
So in <hi>Holly,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 22, 23, 25. 24, 28, 29. 33.</note> 
                        <hi>Hazel, Apple,</hi> their <hi>Size</hi> is more equal throughout the
bredth of the <hi>Tree.</hi> But in <hi>Barberry, Elm, Oak, Ash,</hi> very different:
Not fortuitously, but always much after the same manner. For in all
the last named <hi>Branches,</hi> the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> that stand in the inner <hi>margin</hi>
of each annual <hi>Ring,</hi> are all vastly bigger, than any of those that stand
in the outer part of the <hi>King.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>22. §. Thirdly, these <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are also different in their <hi>Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
So in <hi>Apple,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 25, 30, 31.</note> 
                        <hi>Wallnut, Fig,</hi> they are spread all abroad in every
annual <hi>Ring;</hi> not being posited in any one certain <hi>Line.</hi> In others,
they keep more within the compass of some <hi>Line</hi> or <hi>Lines;</hi> either <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametral,</hi>
or <hi>Peripherial.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 22. 23, 32.</note> So in <hi>Holly</hi> they are <hi>Radiated,</hi> or run in even
<hi>Diametral Lines</hi> betwixt the <hi>Pith</hi> and the <hi>Barque.</hi> So also are some of
of them in <hi>Hazel;</hi> and some few in <hi>Wallnut.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>23. §. Whether they stand <hi>Irregularly,</hi> or are <hi>Radiated,</hi> it is to be
noted, That Nature, for the most part, so disposeth of them, that
many of them may still stand very near the <hi>Insertions.</hi> So in <hi>Apple,</hi>
she will rather decline making an even <hi>Line;</hi> or in <hi>Holly,</hi> will rather
break that <hi>Line</hi> into <hi>Parcels,</hi> than that the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> shall stand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from the <hi>Insertions.</hi> To what end this is done, shall be said
hereafter.</p>
                     <p>24. §. Again, in <hi>Ash,</hi> the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are none of them <hi>Radiated,</hi>
but most of them stand in <hi>Circles</hi> on the inner <hi>Margin</hi> of every annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<hi>Ring.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 24. 29. 28. 26, 27.</note> Which <hi>Circle</hi> is sometimes very thick, as in <hi>Ash</hi> and <hi>Barberry.</hi>
In others but thin, the <hi>Vessels</hi> standing, for the most part, single
throughout the <hi>Circles;</hi> as in <hi>Elm.</hi> Sometimes again, they both make
a <hi>Circle,</hi> and are also spread abroad; as in <hi>Pear</hi> and <hi>Plum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>25. §. Those likewise which are spread abroad, are sometimes <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly</hi>
posited.<note place="margin">Tab. 24.</note> So in <hi>Barberry,</hi> besides those larger, that make the
<hi>Circle,</hi> there are other smaller ones, that stand, in oblique <hi>Lines,</hi>
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:100350:86"/>
athwart one another; almost like a <hi>Bend,</hi> or sometimes, an entire
or broken <hi>Saltyr</hi> in an <hi>Escutcheon.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 33. 38.</note> In <hi>Oak,</hi> they make rather certain
<hi>Columns,</hi> in the posture of the <hi>Pale.</hi> And in <hi>Elm,</hi> they make, as it
were, many <hi>cross Parcels,</hi> in the posture of the <hi>Fess.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>26. §. This great difference in the <hi>Size</hi> and <hi>Position</hi> of the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi>
in the same individual <hi>Plant,</hi> is one ground, for which, I think
it probable, That there are <hi>divers Kinds</hi> of <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> as well as of
<hi>Sap-Vessels.</hi> Even as in <hi>Animals,</hi> there are divers <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Organs</hi> for
<hi>Spiration,</hi> and the separation of <hi>Aer: Fishes</hi> having their <hi>Branchiae;
Land-Animals</hi> their <hi>Lungs;</hi> and those in <hi>Frogs, &amp;c.</hi> being of a some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
peculiar <hi>Kind.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>27. §. THE <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Texture</hi> of these <hi>Vessels,</hi> and the various
ways whereby they may be best observed, I have already described
and shewed in my <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Roots.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">P. 1. c. 4.</note> As to their <hi>Form,</hi> one thing
remarqued was this; That they are never <hi>Ramified,</hi> but distinctly
continued from one end of a <hi>Plant,</hi> small or great, to the other:
as the <hi>Nerves</hi> are in <hi>Animals.</hi> A further and easie proof whereof,
may be made, only by holding up a piece of an ordinary <hi>Cane,</hi>
about ½ a foot long, cut very smooth at both ends, against a full
light: whereupon, if you keep it in a straight <hi>Line</hi> betwixt the
<hi>Light,</hi> and the cast of your <hi>Eye,</hi> and then look steadily, you may
see quite through it, that is, through the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> which run straight
along the <hi>Cane</hi> from end to end.</p>
                     <p>28. §. As to their <hi>Texture;</hi> whereas, oftentimes, the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi>
appear to be <hi>unroaved</hi> in the form of a very small <hi>Plate,</hi> it is to be
noted, That it is not only of different bredth, in divers <hi>Plants,</hi> and
usually much broader in the <hi>Root,</hi> than in the <hi>Trunk:</hi> but also, that
in the <hi>Trunk,</hi> many times, the said <hi>Vessels</hi> are unroaved or resolved,
not in the form of a <hi>Plate,</hi> but of a <hi>Round-Thred.</hi> The Causes of
which Diversity, are principally Three; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Weftage</hi> of the
<hi>Fibres</hi> of which the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> consist; The deference betwixt the
said <hi>Fibres,</hi> or betwixt the <hi>Warp</hi> and the <hi>Woof;</hi> And the different
<hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Woof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>29. §. By the <hi>Weftage</hi> of the <hi>Fibres,</hi> it is, That the <hi>Vessels,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes,
<hi>unroave</hi> in the form of a <hi>Plate.</hi> As if we should imagine a
piece of fine narrow <hi>Ribband,</hi> to be woun'd spirally, and Edg to Edg,
round about a Stick; and so, the Stick being drawn out, the <hi>Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi>
to be left in the <hi>Figure</hi> of a <hi>Tube,</hi> answerable to an <hi>Aer-Vessel.</hi>
For that which,<note place="margin">Tab. 39.</note> upon the <hi>unroaving</hi> of the <hi>Vessel,</hi> seems to be a <hi>Plate,</hi>
or one single <hi>Piece,</hi> is, as it were, a <hi>Natural Ribband,</hi> consisting of
several Pieces, that is, a certain number of <hi>Threds</hi> of <hi>Round Fibres,</hi>
standing parallel, as the <hi>Threds</hi> do in an <hi>Artifical Ribband.</hi> And as
in a <hi>Ribband,</hi> so here, the <hi>Fibres</hi> which make the <hi>Warp,</hi> and which are
Spirally continu'd; although they run parallel, yet are not coallescent;
but conteined together, by other Transverse <hi>Fibres</hi> in the place of
a <hi>Woof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>30. §. And as the said <hi>Fibres</hi> are transversly continued, thereby
making a <hi>Warp</hi> and <hi>Woof:</hi> So are they (as in divers woven <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures)</hi>
of very different <hi>Bulk;</hi> those of the Former, being much
bigger, and therefore much stronger, than those of the Latter. By
which means, as <hi>Cloth</hi> or <hi>Silk</hi> will often Tear one way, and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
so here, while the <hi>Warp</hi> or those <hi>Fibres</hi> which are Spirally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100350:87"/>
are usually <hi>unroaved</hi> without breaking; those smaller ones,
by which they are <hi>stitched</hi> or <hi>woven</hi> together, easily tear in sunder
all the way.</p>
                     <p>31. And because the <hi>Fibres</hi> of the <hi>Woof,</hi> are themselves also of
different <hi>Bulk;</hi> therefore it is, That where they are more sturdy,
as usually in the <hi>Root,</hi> they require a greater quantity of <hi>Warp,</hi>
that is, a broader <hi>Plate,</hi> to overmatch them. Whereas, where they
are more extream small, as in the <hi>Trunk</hi> and <hi>Leaves,</hi> one <hi>Thred</hi> of the
<hi>Warp,</hi> that is, one <hi>Spiral Fibre,</hi> will be strong enough of it self, and
so, sometimes, be singly <hi>unroav'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>32. §. From the extream Tenuity of these <hi>Fibres,</hi> it is, That
they are very rarely discern'd, and not without the greatest difficulty.
As also, from their great Tenderness; whereby not enduring to be
drawn out, they all break off close to the Sides of the <hi>Spiral ones.</hi> In the
<hi>Pith,</hi> the like Transverse <hi>Fibres</hi> are a little more visible: which first
conducted Me to the notice of them here also.</p>
                     <p>33. §. All the <hi>Fibres</hi> of the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> both the <hi>Warp</hi> and the
<hi>Woof,</hi> are of the same Substantial Nature with the <hi>Pith</hi> and the other
<hi>Parenchymous Parts</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi> From whence it is, That whereas the
<hi>Towy Parts</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> whereof all <hi>Linen Manufactures</hi> are made,
are very <hi>Strong</hi> and <hi>Tough;</hi> these, as is abovesaid, are extream <hi>Tender</hi>
and <hi>Brittle,</hi> like those of the <hi>Pith</hi> and all the <hi>Pithy Parts.</hi> To which
therefore, the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are to be referr'd. And the <hi>Content</hi> of both,
is oftentimes the same.</p>
                     <p>34. §. From whence, we have a further proof of what I have
formerly asserted,<note place="margin">B. 1. c. 7. §. 13, 14.</note> which is, That in all <hi>Plants,</hi> there are <hi>Two</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially
different <hi>Parts,</hi> and no more than <hi>Two, viz.</hi> the <hi>Pithy,</hi> and
the <hi>Towy</hi> or <hi>Lignous Parts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>35. §. From hence also we have some ground to conjecture, That
so many of the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> at least, which are not formed with the
seed, but <hi>post-nate,</hi> are originated from the <hi>Parenchymous Parts;</hi> which
seem by some alteration in the <hi>Quality, Position</hi> and <hi>Texture</hi> of the
<hi>Fibres,</hi> to be Transformed into <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> as <hi>Caterpillars</hi> are into <hi>Flies.</hi>
And as the <hi>Pith</hi> it self, by the Rupture and Shrinking up of several
<hi>Rows</hi> of <hi>Bladders,</hi> doth oftentimes become Tubulary: So is it also
probable, that in the other <hi>Parenchymous Parts,</hi> one single <hi>Row</hi> or <hi>File</hi>
of <hi>Bladders</hi> evenly and perpendicularly piled; may sometimes, by the
shrinking up of their Horizontal <hi>Fibres,</hi> all regularly breakone into
another and so make one <hi>continued Cavity;</hi> or a <hi>Tube,</hi> whose <hi>Diametre</hi> is
the same with that of the <hi>Bladders,</hi> wherof it is composed. All which,
will appear more probable, and what hath been said, be yet better
understood, when we come, in the next <hi>Chapter,</hi> to the Description
of the <hi>Pith.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Third General <hi>Part</hi> of a <hi>Branch</hi> is the <hi>Pith.</hi>
Which though it have a different name from the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchyma</hi>
in the <hi>Barque,</hi> and the <hi>Insertions</hi> in the
<hi>Wood;</hi> yet, as to its <hi>Substance,</hi> it is the very same
with them both. Whereof there is a double evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<hi>sc.</hi> their <hi>Continuity,</hi> and the sameness of their
<hi>Texture.</hi> Their <hi>Texture</hi> shall be shewed presently.
As to their <hi>Continuity,</hi> it is to be noted, That as the <hi>Skin</hi> is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
with the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Barque;</hi> and this <hi>Parenchyma</hi> likewise,
with the <hi>Insertions</hi> in the <hi>Wood;</hi> so these <hi>Insertions</hi> again, running
through the <hi>Wood,</hi> are also continuous with the <hi>Pith.</hi> So that the <hi>Skin,
Parenchyma, Insertions,</hi> and <hi>Pith,</hi> are all <hi>One entire piece of Work;</hi>
being only filled up, in divers manners, with the <hi>Vessels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. The <hi>Size</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> is various, being not the same in any
two <hi>Branches</hi> here represented.<note place="margin">Tab. 24, 31, 34, 35. 22, 29, 30, 32. 23, 25, 26, 35. 27. 28.</note> In <hi>Wormwood, Sumach, Fig, Barbery,</hi>
'tis very large; <hi>sc.</hi> betwixt 5, and 7 <hi>Inches Diametre,</hi> as it appears
through the <hi>Microscope.</hi> In <hi>Pine, Ash, Holly, Walnut,</hi> not so large;
from 3 <hi>Inches Diameter</hi> to 4. In <hi>Oak, Apple, Pear, Hazel,</hi> lesser, scarce
from 2, to 3. In <hi>Damascene,</hi> not above an <hi>Inch</hi> and half. And in <hi>Elm,</hi>
scarce an <hi>Inch Diameter.</hi> Note also, that of all <hi>Plants,</hi> both <hi>Herbs,</hi>
and <hi>Shrubs,</hi> have generally the largest <hi>Piths,</hi> in proportion with the
other <hi>Parts</hi> of the same <hi>Branch,</hi> as in <hi>Sumach, Fig, Barbery,</hi> is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.</p>
                     <p>3. §. It is also worth the noting, That wheras, in most <hi>Plants,</hi>
the <hi>Barque</hi> and <hi>Wood</hi> do both grow thicker every year: the <hi>Pith,</hi> on
the contrary, groweth more slender; So that in a <hi>Branch</hi> of one years
growth, it is apparently more ample, than in one of two; and in a
<hi>Branch</hi> of two, than in one of three; and so on.</p>
                     <p>4. §. The <hi>Pith,</hi> for the most part, if not always, in the <hi>Branch,</hi>
as well as the <hi>Root,</hi> is furnished with a certain number of <hi>Sap-Vessels.</hi>
They are here usually so postur'd, as to make a <hi>Ring</hi> on the <hi>Margin</hi>
of the <hi>Pith.</hi> Where they are more numerous, or large, they are more
evident;<note place="margin">Tab. 30, 31, 32.</note> as in <hi>Walnut, Fig, Pine,</hi> and others. They are also of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<hi>Kinds,</hi> answerable to those in the <hi>Barque;</hi> as in <hi>Wallnut, Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeducts;</hi>
in <hi>Fig, Lacteals;</hi> in <hi>Pine, Resiniferous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. The <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> is composed of <hi>Bladders.</hi> Which
are the very same with those in the <hi>Barque,</hi> and oftentimes in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions</hi>
within the <hi>Wood.</hi> Only these in the <hi>Pith,</hi> are of the largest
<hi>Size;</hi> those in the <hi>Barque,</hi> of a lesser; and those of the <hi>Insertions</hi>
least of all: for which reason they are less obvious than in the <hi>Pith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. The <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Pith,</hi> though always comparatively
Great;<note place="margin">Tab. 24, 31.</note> yet are of very different <hi>Sizes.</hi> Being easily distinguished, even
as to their <hi>Horizontal Area,</hi> to <hi>Twenty</hi> Degrees. Those of <hi>Fig, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,</hi>
and some others, are somewhat large. And of many <hi>Herbs;</hi> as
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100350:88"/>
of <hi>Thistle,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 39.</note> 
                        <hi>Borage,</hi> and others, three times as big again; appearing in
the <hi>Microscope,</hi> like to the largest <hi>Cells</hi> of an <hi>Hony-comb.</hi> Those of
<hi>Plum, Worm-wood, Sumach,</hi> less. Of <hi>Elm, Apple, Pear,</hi> lesser. Of
<hi>Holly</hi> and <hi>Oak,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 32.</note> still less. So that the <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> in <hi>Borage</hi>
or Common <hi>Thistle,</hi> are of that <hi>Size,</hi> as to contain, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
only of their <hi>Horizontal Area,</hi> about twenty <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi>
of <hi>Oak.</hi> Wherefore one whole <hi>Bladder</hi> in <hi>Thistle,</hi> is, at least an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
times bigger, than another in <hi>Oak.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. Of the <hi>Size</hi> of these <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Pith,</hi> 'tis also to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
That it doth not at all follow the <hi>Size</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> it self; but is
still varied, according as Nature designeth the <hi>Pith</hi> for various use.
Thus, whereas the <hi>Pith</hi> of <hi>Sumach,</hi> is Larger than that of <hi>Barberry;</hi>
it might be thought, that the <hi>Bladders,</hi> whereof it is composed,
should be likewise Larger: Yet are they Three times as Small again in
<hi>Sumach,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 24, 34. 26, 27. 22, 23.</note> as they are in <hi>Barberry.</hi> So the <hi>Pith</hi> of <hi>Plum,</hi> is far Less, than
that of <hi>Pear;</hi> yet the <hi>Bladders</hi> of the former are Four or Five times
as big, as those of the latter. So the <hi>Pith</hi> of <hi>Hazel</hi> is almost Three
times as Little again, as that of <hi>Holly;</hi> yet the <hi>Bladders</hi> in <hi>Hazel,</hi> are
Ten times bigger, than in <hi>Holly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. The <hi>Shape</hi> of the <hi>Bladders</hi> hath also some Variety. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though,
for the most part, they are more round; yet oftentimes they
are angular: as in <hi>Reed-grass,</hi> a <hi>Water-plant;</hi> where they are <hi>Gubical;</hi>
and in <hi>Borage, Thistle,</hi> and many others, where they are <hi>pentangular,
sexangular</hi> and <hi>septangular.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. Of the <hi>Texture</hi> of the <hi>Bladders,</hi> 'tis also to be noted, that
many times, the <hi>Sides</hi> of the greater <hi>Bladders</hi> are composed of lesser;
as is often seen in those of <hi>Borage, Bulrush,</hi> and some other <hi>Plants.</hi> In
the same manner, as the <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi> are but greater <hi>Fibres</hi> made up of
lesser.</p>
                     <p>10. §. The <hi>Pith,</hi> though always originally composed of <hi>Bladders,</hi>
and so <hi>One Entire Piece;</hi> yet in process, as the <hi>Plant</hi> grows up, it hath
divers openings or <hi>Ruptures</hi> made in it: oftentimes very regularly, and
always for good use, and with constancy observed in the same <hi>Species</hi> of
<hi>Plants.</hi> In <hi>Sharp-poynted Dock,</hi> many of the <hi>Pores</hi> are considerably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
by the length, like small <hi>Pipes.</hi> In <hi>Walnut</hi> it shrinketh up into
transverse <hi>Filmes</hi> or <hi>Membranes;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 19.</note> as likewse sometimes in <hi>Spanish-Broom.</hi>
Sometimes the <hi>Pith</hi> is hollow or Tubulary: either throughot the <hi>Trunk,</hi>
as in <hi>Thistle, Endive, Scorzonera, Marsh-Mallow:</hi> or so, as to remain
entire at every joynt; as in <hi>Sonchus, Nettle, Teasle;</hi> in which it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
as it were into several <hi>Stories:</hi> and divers other ways.</p>
                     <p>11. §. I SHALL conclude this discourse with a further illustrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Texture</hi> of the <hi>Pith,</hi> and of the whole <hi>Plant,</hi> as consequent
thereupon. I say therefore, (and have given some account hereof in
the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Roots)</hi> That as the <hi>Vessels</hi> of a <hi>Plant, sc.</hi> the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi>
and the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> are made up of <hi>Fibres;</hi> according to what I
have in this Discourse above said; so the <hi>Pith</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> or the <hi>Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
whereof the <hi>Pith</hi> consists are likewise made up of <hi>Fibres.</hi> Which
is true also of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Barque.</hi> And also of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions</hi>
in the <hi>Wood.</hi> Yea, and of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and all other <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymous
Parts</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi> I say, that the very <hi>Pulp</hi> of an <hi>Apple,
Pear, Cucumber, Plum,</hi> or any other <hi>Fruit,</hi> is nothing else but <hi>a Ball
of most extream small transparent Threds or Fibres, all wrapped and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100350:88"/>
stitch'd up</hi> (though in divers manners) <hi>together.</hi> And even all those
<hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> which are neither formed into visible <hi>Tubes,</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Bladders,</hi> are yet made up of <hi>Fibers.</hi> Which, though it be difficul
to observe, in any of those <hi>Parts</hi> which are closer wrought and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
in the <hi>Insertions</hi> of some <hi>Trees:</hi> yet in the <hi>Pith,</hi> especially of some
<hi>Plants,</hi> which consisteth of more open <hi>work,</hi> they are more visible.
Which introduceth the observation of them in all other <hi>Parenchymous
Parts.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 38.</note> So in the <hi>Pith</hi> of a <hi>Bulrush</hi> of the <hi>Common Thistle,</hi> and some
other <hi>Plants;</hi> not only the <hi>Threds</hi> of which the <hi>Bladders;</hi> but also the
single <hi>Fibres,</hi> of which the <hi>Threds</hi> are composed; may sometimes with
the help of a good <hi>Glass,</hi> be distinctly seen. Yet one of these <hi>Fibres,</hi>
may reasonably be computed to be a Thousand times smaller than an
<hi>Horse-Hair.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. §. The <hi>Fibrosity</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is also visible in some <hi>Woods,</hi>
in which, it is apparently mixed with the <hi>Lignous Parts,</hi> not only by
<hi>Insertions,</hi> but <hi>per minimas Partes organicas.</hi> That is to say, The <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymous
Fibres,</hi> like smaller <hi>Threds,</hi> are either <hi>wraped round about</hi> both
the <hi>Lignous</hi> and the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> or at least <hi>interwoven</hi> with them, and
with every <hi>Fiber</hi> of every <hi>Vessel:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 39.</note> as in very white <hi>Ash</hi> or <hi>Fir-Wood,</hi>
with an advantagious posture and light, may be observed.</p>
                     <p>13. §. WHENCE it follows, that the whole <hi>Substance,</hi> or all
the <hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> so far as <hi>Organical,</hi> they also consist of <hi>Fibres.</hi>
Of all which <hi>Fibres</hi> those of the <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> run only by the
<hi>Length</hi> of the <hi>Plant:</hi> those of the <hi>Pith, Insertions,</hi> and <hi>Parenchyma</hi>
of the <hi>Barque,</hi> run by the <hi>breadth</hi> or horizontally: those of the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi>
fetch their Circuit by the <hi>Breadth,</hi> and continue it by the
<hi>Length.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>14. §. By which means, the said <hi>Parenchymous Fibres,</hi> in fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>horizontal Circles,</hi> do thus <hi>weave,</hi> and make up the <hi>Bladders</hi>
of the <hi>Pith,</hi> in <hi>Open-Work.</hi> And the same <hi>Fibres</hi> being thence conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued;
they also <hi>weave</hi> and make up the <hi>Insertions,</hi> but in <hi>Close-Work.</hi>
Betwixt which <hi>Insertions,</hi> the <hi>Vessels</hi> being likewise transversly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
some of the same <hi>Fibres wrap</hi> themselves also about these; thus
<hi>tying</hi> many of them together, and so making those several <hi>Conjugati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and <hi>Braces</hi> of the <hi>Vessels,</hi> which I have formerly described. And
as some of these <hi>Horizontal Fibres</hi> are <hi>wraped</hi> about the <hi>Vessels;</hi> so also
about the <hi>Fibres,</hi> whereof the <hi>Vessels</hi> are composed. By which
means it is,<note place="margin">Tab. 40.</note> that all the <hi>Fibres</hi> of the <hi>Vessels</hi> are <hi>Tacked</hi> or <hi>Stitched</hi>
up close together into One Coherent Piece. Much after the same
manner, as the <hi>Perpendicular Splinters</hi> or <hi>Twigs</hi> of a <hi>Basket,</hi> are, by
those that run in and out <hi>Horizontally.</hi> And the same <hi>Horizontal Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,</hi>
being still further produced into the <hi>Barque;</hi> they there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the same <hi>work</hi> over again (only not so <hi>open)</hi> as in the <hi>Pith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>15. §. SO THAT the most unfeigned and proper resemblance
we can at present, make of the whole <hi>Body</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> is, To a piece
of <hi>fine Bone-Lace,</hi> when the Women are working it upon the <hi>Cushion,</hi>
For the <hi>Pith, Insertions,</hi> and <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Barque,</hi> are all extream
Fine and Perfect <hi>Lace-Work:</hi> the <hi>Fibres</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> running <hi>Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontally,</hi>

<hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> and <hi>Barque,</hi> as the <hi>Threds</hi> do the several
<hi>Holes</hi> of the <hi>Lace;</hi> and making up the <hi>Insertions</hi> without <hi>Bladders,</hi> or
with very small ones, as the same <hi>Threds</hi> likewise do the <hi>close</hi> Parts of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100350:89"/>
the <hi>Lace,</hi> which they call the <hi>Cloth-Work.</hi> And lastly, both the <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous</hi>

same <hi>Lace-Work</hi> to be wrought many Thousands of times over and
over again, to any thickness or hight, according to the hight of any

                     <head>CHAP. I. Of the Motion and Course of the Sap.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST, as to the <hi>Course</hi> of the <hi>Sap,</hi> there are
Three <hi>Parts</hi> in which it <hi>moveth; sc.</hi> the <hi>Pith,</hi> the
<hi>Wood,</hi> and the <hi>Barque</hi> First the <hi>Pith;</hi> in which
the <hi>Sap</hi> moveth the <hi>First year,</hi> and <hi>only the First
year.</hi> Or, it is <hi>Proprium quarto modo,</hi> to the <hi>Pith</hi>
of every <hi>Annual Growth,</hi> and to the <hi>Pith</hi> of such a
<hi>Growth</hi> only, <hi>To be succulent.</hi> That is, whether of a
<hi>Sprout</hi> from a <hi>Seed,</hi> or of a <hi>Sucker</hi> from a <hi>Root,</hi> or of a <hi>Cyon</hi> from a
<hi>Branch;</hi> The <hi>Pith</hi> is always found the <hi>First year</hi> full of <hi>Sap.</hi> But the
<hi>Second year,</hi> the same individual <hi>Pith,</hi> always becomes <hi>dry,</hi> and so it
continues ever after.</p>
                     <p>2. §. One cause whereof is, that the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> in the <hi>Barque,</hi>
being the first year adjacent to the <hi>Pith;</hi> they do all that time, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
part of their <hi>Sap</hi> into it, and so keep it always <hi>Succulent.</hi> But the
same <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> the year following, are turned into <hi>Wood;</hi> and
the <hi>Vessels</hi> which are then generated, and carry the <hi>Sap,</hi> stand beyond
them, in the <hi>Barque.</hi> So that the <hi>Sap</hi> being now more remote from
the <hi>Pith,</hi> and intercepted by the new <hi>Wood,</hi> it cannot be transfused,
with that sufficient force and plenty as before, into the <hi>Pith;</hi> which
therefore, from the first year, always continues dry.</p>
                     <p>3. §. THE SECOND <hi>Part</hi> in which the <hi>Sap moves, sub for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
liquoris,</hi> is the <hi>Wood.</hi> Which yet, it doth not in all <hi>Plants,</hi> but
only in some; and visibly, in very few; as in the <hi>Vine:</hi> In a <hi>Vine,</hi> I
say, the <hi>Sap</hi> doth <hi>visibly ascend</hi> by the <hi>Wood.</hi> And this it doth, not
only the first year, but every year, so long as the <hi>Vine</hi> continues to
grow. But although this <hi>ascent,</hi> in or through the <hi>Wood,</hi> be every
year; yet it is only in the <hi>Spring,</hi> for about the space of a Month; <hi>sc.</hi>
in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. There are many other <hi>Trees,</hi> besides the <hi>Vine,</hi> wherein, about
the same time of the year, the <hi>Sap ascendeth,</hi> though not so copiously,
yet chiefly, in the <hi>Wood.</hi> For if we take a <hi>Branch</hi> of two or three
years growth, suppose of <hi>Sallow,</hi> and having first cut the same trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versely;
if the <hi>Barque</hi> be then also transversely, and with some force,
pressed with the back of the knife, near the newly cut end; the <hi>Sap</hi>
will very plainly rise up out of the utmost <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Wood.</hi> And if it
be pressed in the same manner, or a little more strongly, about an Inch
lower, the <hi>Sap</hi> will ascend out of every <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Wood</hi> to the Center.
Yet at the same time, which is to be noted, there <hi>ariseth</hi> no <hi>Sap</hi> at all
out of the <hi>Barque.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. Whence appears the Error of that so Common Opinion,
That <hi>the Sap always riseth betwixt the Wood and the Barque.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
whereunto is most true, That it never doth. For the greater
part of the year, it riseth in the <hi>Barque, sc.</hi> in the inner <hi>Margin</hi> adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100350:90"/>
to the <hi>Wood,</hi> and in <hi>Spring,</hi> in or through the <hi>Wood</hi> it self, and
there only.</p>
                     <p>6. §. THE THIRD <hi>Part</hi> in which the <hi>Sap</hi> ascends, is the
<hi>Barque,</hi> as was above hinted, and may be observ'd in almost any
<hi>Branch,</hi> if cut cross, in the <hi>late Spring</hi> and in <hi>Summer;</hi> either as the
<hi>Sap</hi> issueth spontaneously, or upon pressing, as aforesaid. So that
when the <hi>Sap</hi> ceaseth to ascend, <hi>sub forma liquoris,</hi> by the <hi>Wood,</hi> then
it begins to ascend by the <hi>Barque.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. Besides the difference of <hi>Time,</hi> the <hi>Organical Parts</hi> likewise,
in which these two <hi>Saps</hi> ascend, are divers. For in the <hi>Barque,</hi> it
ascendeth <hi>visibly,</hi> only in the <hi>Succiferous,</hi> whereas in the <hi>Wood,</hi> it
ascendeth only by the <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. FROM what hath been said, we may understand, what is
meant by the <hi>Bleeding</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi> If we take it generally, it properly
enough expresses, <hi>The eruption of the Sap out of any Vessels.</hi> And so,
almost all <hi>Plants,</hi> in <hi>Summer</hi> time, do <hi>Bleed,</hi> that is, from <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi>
either in the <hi>Barque,</hi> or in the <hi>Margin</hi> of the <hi>Pith:</hi> the <hi>Saps</hi> they
<hi>Bleed,</hi> having either a <hi>Sower, Sweet, Hot, Bitter,</hi> or other <hi>Tast.</hi> At
which time, the <hi>Vessels</hi> also, in the <hi>Barque</hi> of a <hi>Vine-Branch,</hi> do <hi>Bleed</hi>
a <hi>Sower Sap.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. But that which is <hi>vulgarly</hi> called <hi>Bleeding,</hi> as in a <hi>Vine,</hi> is
quite another thing; both as to the <hi>Liquor</hi> which issueth, and the <hi>Place</hi>
where it issues: that is to say, it is neither a <hi>Sweet,</hi> nor <hi>Sower,</hi> but
<hi>Tasteless Sap;</hi> issuing, not from any <hi>Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Barque,</hi> but from
the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Wood.</hi> So that there is as much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Bleeding</hi> in a <hi>Vine,</hi> or the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Sap</hi> in any other <hi>Tree,</hi>
in <hi>March,</hi> and in <hi>July;</hi> as there is betwixt <hi>Salivation</hi> and an <hi>Haemorrhage;</hi>
or betwixt the <hi>Course</hi> of the <hi>Chyle</hi> in the <hi>Lactiferous Vessels,</hi> and the
<hi>Circulation</hi> of the <hi>Blood</hi> in the <hi>Arteries</hi> and <hi>Veins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. §. NOW the Cause from whence it comes to pass, that the
<hi>early Spring-Sap</hi> of a <hi>Vine,</hi> and other <hi>Trees,</hi> ascendeth by the <hi>Wood,</hi> is,
In that the <hi>Generation</hi> of the young <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Barque,</hi> by
which the <hi>Sap</hi> ascendeth all the <hi>Summer;</hi> is, in the beginning of <hi>Spring,</hi>
but newly attempted. So that the <hi>Sap</hi> having not yet these <hi>Vessels</hi> to
receive it, it therefore <hi>(pro hac vice)</hi> runs up the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> in
the <hi>Wood.</hi> But so soon as the said <hi>Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Barque</hi> begin to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably
encreased, the <hi>Sap,</hi> declining the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> betakes it self to
<hi>These,</hi> as its most proper <hi>Receptacles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. §. THE CAUSE also, why the <hi>Vessels</hi> of almost all
<hi>Plants,</hi> upon cutting, do yield <hi>Sap,</hi> or <hi>Bleed;</hi> is the <hi>Pressure</hi> which the
<hi>Parenchyma</hi> makes upon them. For the <hi>Pith</hi> and other <hi>Parenchymous
Parts</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> upon the reception of <hi>Liquor,</hi> have always a <hi>Conatus</hi>
to <hi>dilate</hi> themselves. As is manifest from <hi>Sponges,</hi> which are a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the same Nature, and have a somewhat like structure. As
also from <hi>Cork,</hi> which is but the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or <hi>Barque</hi> of a <hi>Tree.</hi> I say
therefore, that the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> being fill'd and swell'd with <hi>Sap,</hi> hath
thereby a continual <hi>Conatus</hi> to <hi>dilate</hi> it self; and in the same degree,
to press together or contract the <hi>Vessels</hi> which it surroundeth. And
the said <hi>Vessels</hi> being cut, their actual <hi>Contraction</hi> and the <hi>Eruption</hi> of
the <hi>Sap,</hi> do both immediately follow.</p>
                     <p>12. §. IT may be also noted, That the <hi>Trunk</hi> or <hi>Branch</hi> of any <hi>Plant</hi>
being cut, it always <hi>bleeds</hi> at both ends, or upwards and downwards,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100350:91"/>
alike freely. Which, as well as divers other <hi>Experiments</hi> plainly
shews, That in the <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> there are no <hi>Valves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13. §. FROM what we have now above, and elsewhere formerly
said, we may also understand the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>Ascent</hi> of the <hi>Sap.</hi>
As to which, I say, <hi>First,</hi> That considering to what height and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the <hi>Sap</hi> sometimes ascends; it is not intelligible, how it should
thus ascend, by virtue of any one <hi>Part</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> alone; that is
neither by virtue of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> nor by virtue of the <hi>Vessels,</hi>
alone. Not by the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> alone. For this, as it hath the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a <hi>Sponge</hi> or <hi>Filtre,</hi> to suck up the <hi>Sap;</hi> so likewise, to suck
it up but to a certain heigth, as perhaps, about an Inch, or two, and
no more.</p>
                     <p>14. §. Nor by the <hi>Vessels</hi> alone, for the same reason. For all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we see, that small <hi>Glass-Pipes</hi> immersed in Water, will give
it an ascent for some Inches; yet there is a certain <hi>period,</hi> according
to the <hi>bore</hi> of the <hi>Pipe,</hi> beyond which it will not rise. We must
therefore joyn the <hi>Vessels</hi> and the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> both together in this
Service; which we may conceive performed by them in the manner
following.</p>
                     <p>15. §. Let A B be the <hi>Vessel</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi> Let C E D F be the
<hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> wherewith, as with so many little <hi>Cisterns,</hi>
it is surrounded.<note place="margin">Tab. 39.</note> I say then, that the <hi>Sap,</hi> in the <hi>Pipe</hi> B A, would, of
it self, rise but a few Inches; as suppose, from D to L. But the <hi>Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
D P, which surround it, being swelled up and turgid with <hi>Sap,</hi>
do hereby press upon it; and so not only a little contract its bore,
but also transfuse or strain some <hi>Portion</hi> of their <hi>Sap</hi> thereinto: by
both which means, the <hi>Sap</hi> will be forced to rise higher therein. And
the said <hi>Pipe</hi> or <hi>Vessel</hi> being all along surrounded by the like <hi>Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi>
the <hi>Sap</hi> therein, is still forced higher and higher: the <hi>Bladders</hi>
of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> being, as is said, so many <hi>Cisterns</hi> of <hi>Liquor,</hi> which
transfuse their repeated Supplies throughout the length of the <hi>Pipe.</hi>
So that by the supply and pressure of the <hi>Cisterns</hi> or <hi>Bladders</hi> F D, the
the <hi>Sap</hi> riseth to L; by the <hi>Bladders</hi> Q L, it rises to M; by the
<hi>Bladders</hi> N M, it rises to I; by the <hi>Bladders</hi> O I, it rises to K; by the
<hi>Bladders</hi> PK, it rises to E; and so to the top of the <hi>Tree.</hi> And thus
far of the <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Sap.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE NEXT enquiry to be made, is, into the

whereof, the <hi>Pores</hi> are so very large, in

                     <p>2. §. In the <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Pine,</hi> they are likewise through a <hi>Glass,</hi> a
very Elegant Show; standing all most exactly, in <hi>rank</hi> and <hi>file,</hi>
throughout the length of the <hi>Leaves.</hi> The <hi>Figure</hi> whereof shall be

                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. But although the <hi>Aer</hi> enters, in part, at the <hi>Trunk</hi> and other
<hi>Parts,</hi> especially in some <hi>Plants;</hi> yet its <hi>chief</hi> entrance, is at the
<hi>Root.</hi> Even as some Parts of <hi>Aer,</hi> may continually pass into the <hi>Body</hi>
and <hi>Blood,</hi> by the <hi>Habit,</hi> or <hi>Pores</hi> of the <hi>Skin;</hi> but the chief entrance
hereof, is at the <hi>Mouth.</hi> And what the <hi>Mouth</hi> is, to an <hi>Animal;</hi> that
the <hi>Root</hi> is to a <hi>Plant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. Again, if the chief entrance of the <hi>Aer,</hi> were at the <hi>Trunk;</hi> then,
before it could be mixed with the <hi>Sap</hi> in the <hi>Root,</hi> it must descend;
and so move not only contrary to its own Nature, but likewise in a
contrary Course to the <hi>Sap,</hi> throughout the <hi>Plant.</hi> Whereas, by its
<hi>Reception</hi> at the <hi>Root,</hi> and so its <hi>Transition</hi> from thence; it hath a more
natural and easie motion of Ascent. For while the <hi>Sap</hi> ascends, that
the <hi>Aer,</hi> in the same <hi>Plant,</hi> should continually descend, cannot reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
be supposed.</p>
                     <p>5. §. The same is further argued, From the fewness and small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the <hi>Diametral Portions</hi> in the <hi>Trunk</hi> in comparison with those
in the <hi>Root.</hi> In which <hi>Nature</hi> hath plainly designed the same, for the
<hi>Separation</hi> of the <hi>Aer</hi> from the <hi>Sap,</hi> after they are both together received
thereinto. So that the <hi>Reception</hi> and <hi>Course</hi> of the <hi>Aer,</hi> is made on this
manner following.</p>
                     <p>6. §. THE <hi>Aer</hi> being a <hi>Springy</hi> Body, it insinuates into all the
<hi>Holes</hi> and <hi>Cranies</hi> of the <hi>Earth;</hi> and so is plentifully mixed therewith.
Whereupon, as the <hi>Sap</hi> enters the <hi>Root,</hi> more or less <hi>Aer</hi> still intrudes
it self together with it. The <hi>Liquid</hi> Portion of the <hi>Sap,</hi> swells and
fills up the <hi>Succulent Parts</hi> of the <hi>Barque.</hi> The <hi>Aery</hi> Part, is, as was
said, separated from the <hi>Liquid,</hi> into the <hi>Diametral</hi> Portions. Which
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100350:92"/>
running from the <hi>Barque</hi> towards the Centre of the <hi>Root,</hi> and so pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
along betwixt the <hi>Aer-Vessels;</hi> do hereby convey the <hi>Aery</hi> Part
of the <hi>Sap</hi> from the <hi>Barque,</hi> into the same.</p>
                     <p>7. §. Being thus received into the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> and the <hi>Reception</hi>
thereof, by the same means continued; it is by them advanced into
the <hi>Trunk.</hi> In which advance, it is again, more or less, disbursed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all the <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> as it goes. <hi>Partly,</hi> inwards to the <hi>Pith.</hi>
From whence, the <hi>Pith</hi> is always, at length, filled with <hi>Aer. Partly,</hi>
into the <hi>Insertions;</hi> by which it is conveyed outward into the <hi>Barque.</hi>
Wherein, it is in some part, transfused through the <hi>Sap:</hi> and so the
rest, with part of the <hi>Sap,</hi> remitted, in <hi>perspirations,</hi> back again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Aer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. So that, whereas the <hi>Diametral Portions</hi> in the <hi>Root,</hi> do
serve to convey the <hi>Aer</hi> from the <hi>Sap</hi> in the <hi>Barque,</hi> into the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi>
in the <hi>Wood:</hi> on the contrary, the <hi>Insertions</hi> here in the
<hi>Trunk,</hi> serve to convey the <hi>Aer</hi> from the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Wood,</hi> into
the <hi>Sap,</hi> in the <hi>Barque.</hi> Wherefore, as the <hi>Aer-Vessels advance</hi> the <hi>Aer,</hi>
or the <hi>Aery Part</hi> of the <hi>Sap,</hi> and so convey it by the <hi>length</hi> of the <hi>Trunk;</hi>
so the <hi>Insertions filter</hi> it, and convey it by the <hi>breadth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. AND that the <hi>Insertions</hi> have this <hi>Office</hi> or <hi>Subservience</hi>
unto both <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Vessels;</hi> doth yet further appear, if we consider,
That the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are always so postured, as to touch upon the said
<hi>Insertions,</hi> or at least to stand very near them. For either they are
large, and so do frequently touch upon them on both sides; as in
<hi>Elm,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>Ash, Wallnut,</hi> &amp;c. Or if they are small; then they either run
along in even lines collateral and oftentimes contiguous with the said
<hi>Insertions,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">29.</note> as in <hi>Holly:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">22.</note> or at least, are reciprocally, some on one side,
and some on another, inclined to them; as in <hi>Apple.</hi> By all which
means,<note place="margin">25.</note> the <hi>Aer</hi> is more readily conveyed from the <hi>Vessels</hi> into the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. §. A further evidence hereof is this, That generally, the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and the more numerous the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> be; the bigger, or at least,
the more numerous also are the <hi>Insertions:</hi> Especially, if the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
be made (as in all other cases it ought to be, as well as here)
betwixt the several <hi>Species</hi> of the same <hi>Kind.</hi> So <hi>Corin,</hi> which hath
small <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 17.</note> hath also very small <hi>Insertions.</hi> But the <hi>Vine,</hi> hath
both very large: and so for others.</p>
                     <p>11. Wherefore, the <hi>Insertions</hi> minister betwixt the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> and
the <hi>Succiferous;</hi> in the same manner, as the <hi>Vesiculae</hi> of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> do
betwixt the <hi>Bronchiae</hi> and the <hi>Arteries.</hi> That is to say, as in an <hi>Animal,</hi>
the <hi>Bronchiae</hi> deposite the <hi>Aer</hi> into the <hi>Vesiculae</hi> of the <hi>Lungs;</hi> which
administer it to the <hi>Arteries:</hi> so in a <hi>Plant,</hi> the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> deposit the
<hi>Aer</hi> into the <hi>Insertions,</hi> that is into the <hi>Vesiculae</hi> of the <hi>Insertions;</hi> by
which it is gradually <hi>filtred</hi> off into the <hi>Barque</hi> and the <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi>
therein.</p>

already endeavoured to <hi>explicate</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Lib. 2. P. 2.</note> from the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy</hi>
of the <hi>Root,</hi> throughout all particulars.
Some whereof I shall yet further clear.</p>
                     <p>1. §. As <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>Barque</hi> to the
<hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Tree,</hi> Contrary to the common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<hi>That they are not continuous;</hi> but that the <hi>Barque</hi> only surrounds
the <hi>Body,</hi> as a <hi>Scabbard</hi> does a <hi>Sword,</hi> or a <hi>Glove</hi> the <hi>Hand.</hi> As also
seemeth to be proved, by the easy <hi>Slipping</hi> of the <hi>Barque</hi> of <hi>Willow,</hi>
and most other <hi>Trees,</hi> when full of <hi>Sap,</hi> from the <hi>Wood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. But, notwithstanding this, they are as truly continuous, as
the <hi>Skin</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> is with the <hi>Flesh: sc.</hi> by means of the <hi>Parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma;</hi>
which is one entire <hi>Body,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 19.</note> running from the <hi>Barque</hi> into the <hi>Wood,</hi>
and so uniting both together; as in a <hi>Branch</hi> of <hi>Vine</hi> or <hi>Corin-Tree,</hi>
when the <hi>Barque</hi> is stripped off, is apparent; the Spaces between the
several <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Wood,</hi> being silled up with the <hi>Parenchymous,</hi> inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the <hi>Barque.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. Now the reason why the <hi>Barque</hi> nevertheless slips so easily
from the <hi>Wood,</hi> is plain, <hi>viz.</hi> Because most of the young <hi>Vessels</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchymous
Parts,</hi> are there every year successively formed; that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Barque:</hi> where the said <hi>Parts</hi> newly formed, are
as tender, as the tenderest <hi>Vessels</hi> in <hi>Animals.</hi> And we may imagine,
how easie it were at once to tear or break a thousand <hi>Vessels</hi> or <hi>Fibres</hi>
of an <hi>Embrio,</hi> of a <hi>Womb</hi> or <hi>Egg.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. THE same <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Barque</hi> being always <hi>braced,</hi> and
gradually falling off,<note place="margin">Tab. 19.</note> together with the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> into the utmost
<hi>Rind:</hi> Hence it is, that the <hi>Barques</hi> of many <hi>Trees,</hi> are as it were, lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
with several <hi>Cracks</hi> of divers <hi>Sizes,</hi> and sometimes in the <hi>Figure</hi> of
<hi>Rombs:</hi> the said <hi>Fissures</hi> representing the <hi>Position</hi> and <hi>Tract</hi> of the
<hi>Vessels</hi> in their <hi>Braces.</hi> Hence also it is, that the <hi>Barque</hi> of some <hi>Trees,</hi>
as of <hi>Corin, Cherry,</hi> &amp;c. falleth off in <hi>Rings, sc.</hi> because the <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi>
are posited in the same manner in the <hi>Barque.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. The <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi> as they are generated at the inner <hi>Verge</hi> of
the <hi>Barque:</hi> so likewise, in a small quantity, at the utmost <hi>Verge</hi> of the
<hi>Pith.</hi> These being not only fed with a more vigorous <hi>Sap,</hi> but with
great caution, secured within the <hi>Wood,</hi> for the propagation of the
succeeding <hi>Buds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. Hence also it is, that is, by the annual accretion of these
<hi>Vessels,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 18.</note> that the <hi>Pith</hi> is sometimes less in the <hi>Trunk,</hi> than in the <hi>Branches;</hi>
and less in the elder <hi>Branches,</hi> than in the youuger; and sometimes 'tis
allmost wholly filled up. By which means, as the <hi>Branches</hi> carry every
year a greater burthen; so they become still more sturdy the better to
support it.</p>
                     <p>7. §. SOMETIMES also the <hi>Pith</hi> breaks and shrinks up, thus
making the <hi>Trunk</hi> a <hi>Pipe.</hi> The cause whereof, is either the <hi>Largeness</hi>
of its <hi>Pores,</hi> or the <hi>Thinness</hi> of the <hi>Sides</hi> of the said <hi>Pores;</hi> upon both
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100350:93"/>
which accounts, the <hi>Pith</hi> doth more easily tear, and upon tearing
shrink up, and so become hollow: as in <hi>Cichory, Lampsana, Sonchus,
Teasel, Brownwort,</hi> and others; wherein the <hi>Pores</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> are
<hi>Large,</hi> and the <hi>Sides</hi> of the <hi>Pores, Thin.</hi> Whereas, upon contrary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
the <hi>Piths</hi> of most <hi>Trees,</hi> remain perpetually entire.</p>
                     <p>8. §. THE Reason why <hi>Plants</hi> are made thus to become <hi>hollow,</hi>
is <hi>partly,</hi> for the <hi>ripening</hi> of the <hi>Fruit</hi> or <hi>Seed;</hi> which is the better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by a more plentiful supply of <hi>Aer</hi> continually received into their
hollow <hi>Trunks.</hi> For by means of that <hi>Aer,</hi> part of the <hi>Sap,</hi> is dryed up,
and the remaining part of it made warmer, and so sooner matured.</p>
                     <p>9. §. <hi>Partly,</hi> for the better determining the due <hi>Age</hi> of the <hi>Plant.</hi>
Hence it is, that the greater part of <hi>Annual Trunks,</hi> are hollow: the
<hi>Aer</hi> contained in that hollow, drying up the <hi>Sap,</hi> and shrinking up the
<hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> so far, as to hinder the free motion of the <hi>Sap</hi> therein; from
whence the <hi>Plant</hi> must needs perish. So that as the <hi>Content</hi> of the
<hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> is a kind of <hi>Vegetable Aer,</hi> whose Office is to <hi>Attenuate,</hi> and
<hi>Ferment</hi> the <hi>Juyces</hi> of <hi>Plants:</hi> so the <hi>Content</hi> of these <hi>Cavities,</hi> cometh
nearer to a more common <hi>Aer,</hi> designed chiefly, so soon as it is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
to <hi>dry</hi> them up.</p>
                     <p>10. §. AGAIN, as to the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> divers questions may be
asked. As how it comes to pass, that they are generally less in the
<hi>Trunk</hi> of the same <hi>Plant,</hi> than in the <hi>Root?</hi> The Cause whereof is,
that here in the <hi>Trunk</hi> they are more under the power of the <hi>Aer;</hi>
both that which entreth in at the <hi>Trunk,</hi> and that which of its own
<hi>Nature</hi> ascendeth up into it from the <hi>Root.</hi> For the <hi>Aer,</hi> as we have
elsewhere said, is the <hi>Mould</hi> of the <hi>Aer-Vessels;</hi> to whose crooked or at
least, <hi>Acid Parts,</hi> the <hi>Saline,</hi> and other <hi>Principles</hi> concurring to their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
do conform. To which they do best, the smaller they are:
the <hi>Fibres</hi> of the larger <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> making greater <hi>Circles,</hi> and so coming
nearer to a <hi>right Line,</hi> answerable to the <hi>Figure</hi> of the Particles, not of
the <hi>Aerial,</hi> but of the <hi>Saline Principle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. §. Wherefore as the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> may be observed still to be dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or widened towards the lower parts of the <hi>Root;</hi> the <hi>Aerial Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
being there less predominant, and the <hi>Saline</hi> more: So towards the
upper part of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> to be contracted or grow smaller; the <hi>Aerial
Principle</hi> being here more predominant, and the <hi>Saline</hi> less.</p>
                     <p>12. §. FOR the same cause it may be observed, That the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi>
of the Second years Growth, and the several years succeeding, are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
nearer of one Size, than those of the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>First;</hi> all being
under a less power of the <hi>Aer,</hi> than the <hi>First.</hi> For the first year the
<hi>Pith</hi> being full of <hi>Liquor,</hi> the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> themselves, are the only <hi>Repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitories</hi>
of the <hi>Aer.</hi> Whereas after the first year, the <hi>Pith</hi> becoming dry,
or another great <hi>Repository</hi> for the <hi>Aer;</hi> the <hi>Aer-Vesseles</hi> are henceforth
filled with a moister or more <hi>Vaporous</hi> and <hi>Saline Aer,</hi> and so made to
grow wider.</p>
                     <p>13. §. Hence the very <hi>Size</hi> of the <hi>Pith,</hi> hath much <hi>influence</hi> upon
the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> and the manner of <hi>Nutrition,</hi> and the <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors</hi>
in <hi>Plants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>14. §. BUT for the most part, the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are somewhat,
more or less, amplified in every new <hi>Annual Ring;</hi> or at least to a certain
number of years. Probably, because in the elder <hi>Branches,</hi> the <hi>Spiral
Fibres,</hi> of which the <hi>Vessels</hi> consist, are more bulky; and so make a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100350:93"/>
                        <hi>Vessel</hi> of a wider, as a more agreeable bore. Nature obtaining here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
that the Quantity of <hi>Aer,</hi> shall always be answerable to the
Growth of the <hi>Plant,</hi> or at least, be sufficient to maintain its <hi>Vegetable
Life</hi> and <hi>Vigour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>15. §. And therefore, as is above hinted, it seems likely, That after
a certain number of years, the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are no longer amplified, but
stand at a stay, and perhaps may grow smaller, according as the <hi>Tree</hi> is
less or more <hi>Longaeve;</hi> and that after this period, it is some way or other
in its Declining State.</p>
                     <p>16. §. LASTLY, from the <hi>Content</hi> and <hi>Governing Principle</hi> of
the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> the <hi>Time,</hi> when they begin every year to be formed, or
to appear, is always <hi>later;</hi> at least with respect to the <hi>season</hi> of the
<hi>Tree.</hi> So that whereas the <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> begin to be formed in <hi>Spring:</hi>
these, not till the latter end of <hi>Summer,</hi> or there about; at least not
till about that time to <hi>appear.</hi> That is, when the <hi>Sap</hi> begins to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
and to grow more <hi>Aery;</hi> and so more fit matter for the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of the said <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi>

The <hi>manner</hi> whereof I have formerly
shewed, in discoursing of the <hi>Root.</hi> Yet some things
I shall here further <hi>explicate.</hi> And <hi>First,</hi> what we
have formerly asserted, <hi>sc.</hi> That the concurrence of
two <hi>specifically</hi> distinct <hi>Fluids,</hi> is as necessary to
<hi>Nutrition</hi> in <hi>Plants,</hi> as in <hi>Animals.</hi> Which appears, as from divers
other considerations, so from the very <hi>Structure</hi> of a <hi>Plant:</hi> where in
all the <hi>Organical Parts,</hi> or the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> and the <hi>Vessels,</hi> are every
where mixed together <hi>per minima,</hi> that is, <hi>per minimas partes organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi>
or <hi>Fiber</hi> with <hi>Fiber</hi> of several <hi>Kinds.</hi> Every small part of a
<hi>Tree,</hi> or of the <hi>Barque</hi> of a <hi>Tree,</hi> being as I may say, a sort of <hi>Linsy-Woolsey.</hi>
So that there is not the least part of the <hi>Sap,</hi> which is not
impregnate with divers <hi>Essential Tinctures,</hi> as it is continually <hi>filtred</hi>
from the <hi>Fibres</hi> of <hi>one Kind,</hi> to those of another; standing every
where <hi>woun'd</hi> and <hi>stitch'd</hi> up together for the same purpose.</p>
                     <p>2. §. FROM the special <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Structure</hi> of the <hi>Parts,</hi> the
<hi>Liquors</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> are likewise <hi>specified.</hi> The <hi>Vessels</hi> being the chief
<hi>Viscera</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi> For all <hi>Liquors</hi> in a <hi>Plant,</hi> are certainly made by
that <hi>Plant.</hi> And since the <hi>Plant</hi> hath no <hi>Viscera</hi> (so called) I would
then know, what its several <hi>Liquors</hi> are made by? If in the <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma,</hi>
surely by that <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> If in the <hi>Vessels,</hi> by the <hi>Vessels.</hi>
And if of divers <hi>Kinds</hi> by divers <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Vessels.</hi> So that what the
<hi>Viscera</hi> are in <hi>Animals,</hi> the <hi>Vessels</hi> themselves are in <hi>Plants.</hi> That is
to say, as the <hi>Viscera</hi> of an <hi>Animal,</hi> are but <hi>Vessels conglomerated:</hi> so
the <hi>Vessels</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> are <hi>Viscera drawn out at length.</hi>

3. §. AGAIN, as the <hi>specifying</hi> of the <hi>Sap</hi> dependeth chiefly on
the special <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Parts:</hi> so partly, upon the <hi>Structure</hi> of the
<hi>Whole.</hi> Whereby every <hi>Part</hi> is still better accomodated with its own
<hi>Juyce.</hi> Thus the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are necessary, not only and barely for a
<hi>supply</hi> of <hi>Aer;</hi> but also by their <hi>Number, Size,</hi> and <hi>Position</hi> to <hi>adjust</hi>
the quantity of that <hi>Aer,</hi> to the government of <hi>Nutrition,</hi> and the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi>
of the <hi>Specifick Liquors</hi> of every <hi>Plant.</hi> Which is evident
from hence, in that they do not follow the <hi>Size</hi> of the <hi>Plant;</hi> but are
great and many, in some small <hi>Plants;</hi> and small and few, in some
others that are large. So <hi>Vines,</hi> and <hi>Corn,</hi> as we have formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
have proportionably a great number of <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> and those
very large. By which means the <hi>Sap</hi> is <hi>attenuated</hi> and less <hi>Oyly,</hi> and
more copiously impregnated with a <hi>Subtle, Volatile</hi> and <hi>Winy Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. For the same reason, the <hi>Stalk</hi> of <hi>Maze</hi> or of <hi>Indian Wheat,</hi>
which when it is <hi>Green</hi> yieldeth a very sweet <hi>Juyce;</hi> and the <hi>Canes,</hi>
whereof <hi>Sugar</hi> (which aboundeth with a <hi>volatile</hi> and <hi>inflammable Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit)</hi>
is made; these, I say, obtain the like over proportion of <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi>
to what we see in most other <hi>Plants.</hi> Hence also it is, that
none of the said <hi>Plants</hi> have any considerable <hi>Barque;</hi> that so the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating
and subtilizing <hi>Aer,</hi> may have a more easie and plentiful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
at the <hi>Trunk</hi> also. For which reason likewise the <hi>Pores</hi> of
the <hi>Skin</hi> of some <hi>Canes</hi> are, as hath been said, remarkably wide.</p>
                     <p>5. §. Hence also it is observable, that of the same <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi>
those <hi>Plants</hi> which have the most, and especially the largest <hi>Aer-Vessels;</hi>
have also the greatest abundance either of a <hi>sweet,</hi> or of a <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Liquor.</hi> So in <hi>Apple;</hi> they are larger than in <hi>Crab;</hi> In <hi>Warden,</hi>
larger than in <hi>Qnince;</hi> and in <hi>Pear-Tree,</hi> larger than in <hi>Warden.</hi> So
also in <hi>Corin,</hi> larger than in <hi>Gooseberrey;</hi> and in <hi>Vine,</hi> larger than in
<hi>Corin:</hi> and so in others.</p>
                     <p>6. §. AND as the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> by their <hi>Multitude</hi> and <hi>Largeness,</hi>
are accommodated to the better making of a <hi>Winy Sap:</hi> so by their <hi>few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>smallness,</hi> of an <hi>Oylie.</hi> As is remarkably seen in <hi>Fir,</hi> and
other <hi>Resiniferous Trees:</hi> these having, if not the <hi>smallest,</hi> yet the
<hi>fewest Aer-Vessels</hi> of all other <hi>Trees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. IF it be asked, how a <hi>Plant</hi> comes to have any <hi>Oyl</hi> at all in
any <hi>Part?</hi> Since we see, that the <hi>Sap</hi> by which the <hi>Root</hi> is fed, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be nothing else but <hi>Water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and that many <hi>Plants</hi> which yield a
great deal of <hi>stillatitious Oyl,</hi> as <hi>Mint, Rue,</hi> and others, will yet grow
in <hi>Water:</hi> I say, if it be enquired how this <hi>Water,</hi> is made <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Oyl?</hi>
I answer, that there is no such matter. But that the <hi>Oyl,</hi> and all other
<hi>Vegetable Principles</hi> are actually existent in, and mixed <hi>per minima,</hi>
though in an extraordinary small proportion, with the <hi>Water.</hi> Even
as we see the distilled <hi>Waters</hi> of <hi>Anise Seeds, Penyroyal,</hi> and the like
to be impregnated with their own <hi>Oyls,</hi> which give the <hi>Taste</hi> and <hi>Smell</hi>
to such <hi>Waters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. Wherefore, as a certain quantity of any <hi>Salt</hi> may be dissolved
in <hi>Water;</hi> beyond which, it will not mix therewith, but remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
its own <hi>Form:</hi> So is there a certain proportion of <hi>Oyl,</hi> though far
less, which may also be perfectly mixed with <hi>Water;</hi> and is certainly
so, more or less, with all the <hi>Water</hi> in the world. But if that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or degree of impregnation be once exceeded; the particles of
<hi>Oyl</hi> do then, and not till then, gather into a body, and appear under
their own <hi>Form.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="133" facs="tcp:100350:94"/>
9. §. I say therefore, that all kinds of <hi>Vegetable Principles,</hi> are
either in or together with the <hi>Water,</hi> with less difference first received
into a <hi>Plant.</hi> But when they are once therein; they are then <hi>separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
that is to say, <hi>filtred,</hi> some from others, in very different <hi>Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
and <hi>Conjunctions</hi> by the several <hi>Parts;</hi> the <hi>Watery</hi> by one <hi>Part,</hi> the
<hi>Aery</hi> by another, the <hi>Oyly</hi> by another, and so the rest: and so every
<hi>Part</hi> is the <hi>Receptacle</hi> of a <hi>Liquor,</hi> become peculiar, not by any <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi>
but only the <hi>Percolation</hi> of <hi>Parts</hi> out of the <hi>common Mass</hi>
or <hi>Stock</hi> of <hi>Sap.</hi> And so all those parts of the <hi>Sap,</hi> which are <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flous</hi>
to any kind of <hi>Plant,</hi> are at the same time, discharged back by
<hi>Perspirations,</hi> into the <hi>Aer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. §. AND, that <hi>Nature,</hi> in the various <hi>Percolations</hi> and <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of the <hi>Sap,</hi> may still the better answer her end; hence, it is, that
she carefully seeth, not only to the special <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Proportion</hi> of
the <hi>Organs,</hi> by which she doth her work; but likewise to their very
<hi>Position.</hi> Thus it is observable, That whereas the <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> which
carry a more <hi>Watery Liquor,</hi> are still placed on the inner <hi>Verge</hi> of the
<hi>Barque,</hi> next to the <hi>Aer-Vessels:</hi> the <hi>Lactiferous</hi> and <hi>Resiniferous Vessels</hi>
of <hi>Plants,</hi> to whose <hi>Oylie Liquor</hi> a mixture of much <hi>Aer</hi> is incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
do usually stand, neither on the inner, nor the outer verge of the
<hi>Barque;</hi> but in the <hi>midle.</hi> By which means, they are at the greatest
distance, and so most secure, from the <hi>Aer;</hi> either that which enters
the <hi>Barque</hi> at the Circumference, or from the <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Pith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. §. AND because the <hi>Resinous Liquors</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> are more
<hi>Oily,</hi> than their <hi>Milky;</hi> their security therefore, from the approach
of the <hi>Aer,</hi> is yet further contrived. In that in <hi>Pine,</hi> and other <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinous
Trees,</hi> the <hi>Diametral Insertions</hi> are never found; or at least, not
<hi>visible:</hi> which yet in other <hi>Trees,</hi> are <hi>conspicuous;</hi> being those <hi>Parts,</hi>
whose office it is, to introduce the <hi>Aer</hi> from the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> into the
<hi>Barque.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. §. AGAIN, the <hi>Milky Liquors</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> being thinner than
the <hi>Resinous,</hi> and having a considerable quantity of <hi>Water</hi> mixed with
their <hi>Oyl;</hi> hence it is, that in <hi>Milky Plants,</hi> as in <hi>Rhus,</hi> there are a
greater number of <hi>Lymphaeducts;</hi> and those standing nearer to the
<hi>Milky Vessels,</hi> than they do in <hi>Pine</hi> and the like, to the <hi>Resinous.</hi> By
which means they are better fitted to affuse their <hi>Aqueous Parts</hi> more
plentifully to the said <hi>Milky Liquor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13. §. FROM the <hi>Mixture</hi> of <hi>Watery Parts</hi> with the <hi>Oylie,</hi> it
comes to pass, that whereas all <hi>Lympha's, Mucilages,</hi> and <hi>Rosins</hi> are
transparent; the <hi>Aquae-oleous Liquors</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> are <hi>Milky</hi> or white<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or otherwise <hi>Opacous.</hi> For the same thing is the cause of the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Vegetable,</hi> as of <hi>Animal-Milk:</hi> that is to say, a more copious
mixture of <hi>Watery</hi> and <hi>Oily Parts per minima,</hi> or into one Body. For
even the <hi>Serous</hi> and <hi>Oylie Parts</hi> of <hi>Animal Milk,</hi> when throughly
separated one from the other, they become very transparent. So the <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latitious
Oyl</hi> of <hi>Anise Seeds,</hi> is most transparent and <hi>limpid,</hi> even as <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
it self: yet there is a known sort of <hi>White Anise-Seed Water,</hi> as it is
commonly called: that it is to say, wherein the <hi>Oyl,</hi> in distillation,
ariseth and is mixed more plentifully with the <hi>Water.</hi> And the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
wherein the stillatitious <hi>Oyl</hi> of any <hi>Vegetable</hi> is dissolved, becomes
a perfect white <hi>Milk;</hi> as in this <hi>Honourable and Learned Presence,</hi> I
have formerly had occasion to shew the Experiment.<note n="a" place="margin">See the <hi>Discourse</hi> of <hi>Mixture</hi>
                        </note>

                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:100350:95"/>
14. §. AND that the <hi>Milky Liquors</hi> of all <hi>Vegetables</hi> whatsoever,
are more <hi>Oylie</hi> than their <hi>Lympha's,</hi> is most certain. For all those <hi>Gums,</hi>
which dissolve either in <hi>Oyl</hi> or in <hi>Water,</hi> as <hi>Galbanum,</hi> and the like,
are originally the <hi>Milky Juyces</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi> And if you take the <hi>Milk</hi>
of any <hi>Plant,</hi> as for instance, the <hi>Milk</hi> of common <hi>Sumach,</hi> or of
any <hi>Taste, Bitter, Astringent, Hot, Cold,</hi> or any other whatsoever;
and having well <hi>dryed</hi> it, and then fired it at a candle; it will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
burn with a very bright and durable flame, even like that of
<hi>Tar</hi> or <hi>Turpentine</hi> it self.</p>
                     <p>15. §. FROM what hath been said, we may likewise gather
the most genuine import of the word <hi>Gum,</hi> and the distinction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
both from a <hi>Rosin</hi> and a <hi>Mucilage.</hi> First, a <hi>Rosin,</hi> is originally a
<hi>Turpentine,</hi> or <hi>Acidoleous Liquor,</hi> having an exceeding small quantity
of <hi>Watery Parts</hi> mixed therewith; and which, for that reason, will
not be dissolved in <hi>Water,</hi> but only in <hi>Oyl.</hi> Of this kind are <hi>Mastick,
Benzoine, Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>camahacca,</hi> and divers others, commonly, in our <hi>Bils</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries,</hi>
called <hi>Gums.</hi> Yet in strict speaking they are all so many
<hi>Rosins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. §. Secondly, a <hi>Gum,</hi> and every <hi>Oylie Gum,</hi> is originally a
<hi>Milky Liquor,</hi> having a greater quantity of <hi>Water</hi> mixed with its
<hi>Oyly Parts;</hi> and which for that reason, will be made to dissolve ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>Water</hi> or <hi>Oyl.</hi> Of this kind are <hi>Sagapen, Opopanax, Ammoniac,</hi>
and others.</p>
                     <p>17. §. The third sort of <hi>Gum,</hi> is that which is <hi>Unoylie,</hi> and which
therefore dissolveth only in <hi>Water,</hi> as <hi>Gum-arabick,</hi> the <hi>Gum</hi> of
<hi>Cherry-Tree,</hi> and others such like. This <hi>Gum,</hi> though commonly so
called, yet is properly but a dryed <hi>Mucilage:</hi> being originally nothing
else but the <hi>Mucilaginous Lympha</hi> issuing from the <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Tree.</hi>
In like manner, as it doth from <hi>Cumfry, Mallow,</hi> and divers other
<hi>Plants:</hi> and even from the <hi>Cucumer.</hi> The <hi>Vessels</hi> whereof, upon cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
cross, yield a <hi>Lympha,</hi> which is plainly <hi>Mucilaginous,</hi> and which
being well dryed, at length becomes a kind of <hi>Gum,</hi> or rather a
hardened <hi>Mucilage.</hi> In like manner, the <hi>Gums</hi> of <hi>Plum-tree, Cherry-tree</hi>
and the like, are nothing else but <hi>dryed Mucilages.</hi> Or, if we will
take the word in its widest sense, then all <hi>Gums</hi> are originally, either
a <hi>Terebinth,</hi> or a <hi>Milk,</hi> or a <hi>Mucilage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>18. §. I have likewise made divers Observations of the <hi>Tasts,
Smells,</hi> and <hi>Colours</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> and of their <hi>Contents,</hi> since those I last
published: and that both for the finding out the true <hi>Causes</hi> of their
<hi>Generation,</hi> and also the applying of them unto <hi>Medical</hi> and other
<hi>Uses.</hi> Of which hereafter.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Fifth Head,</hi> shall be, of the <hi>Figuration</hi> of
<hi>Trunks.</hi> Which also, as well as the <hi>making</hi> of
<hi>Liquors,</hi> dependeth upon the <hi>Structure</hi> of the
<hi>Parts.</hi> As <hi>First,</hi> almost all <hi>Shrubs (caeteris pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus)</hi>
have a greater number of <hi>Aer-Vessels;</hi> and
those of a smaller Size; and consequently much
spread abroad, as most easily yielding to the
<hi>magnetick</hi> Power of the <hi>Aer,</hi> according as we
have more fully demonstrated, in speaking of
the <hi>Vegetation</hi> of <hi>Roots:</hi> as in <hi>Elder, Hazel, Fig, Sumach,</hi> and the like.
By which spreading, the said <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> do sooner, and more easily
strike into the <hi>Barque,</hi> and so produce collateral <hi>Buds</hi> and <hi>Branches,</hi> and
that upon the first rising of the <hi>Body</hi> from the <hi>Root:</hi> that is, the <hi>Plant</hi>
becomes a <hi>Shrub.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. BUT if the said <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are very large, they will not
yield so easily to shoot out collaterally; and so the <hi>Trunk</hi> grows up
taller and more entire: as in <hi>Oak, Wallnut, Elm,</hi> &amp;c. wherein they are
exceeding large, is seen. Hence also the <hi>Vine,</hi> if supported, will grow to a
prodigious length. And <hi>Hops</hi> and <hi>Bryony,</hi> are some of the tallest, amongst
all <hi>Annual Growths:</hi> the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> of all which, are very large. Whereas
<hi>Borage,</hi> and many other like <hi>Plants,</hi> although the <hi>Pores</hi> of their <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma,</hi>
are vastly wide, and silled with <hi>Sap;</hi> yet because their <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi>
are small, they are therefore but <hi>Dwarf-Plants.</hi> Wherefore the tall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or advancement of a <hi>Plant</hi> or <hi>Tree,</hi> dependeth not upon the <hi>Plenty</hi>
of <hi>Sap,</hi> how great soever, but on the <hi>Largeness</hi> of the <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. AGAIN, as a <hi>Plant</hi> or <hi>Tree</hi> grows either <hi>Shrubby,</hi> or <hi>Tall</hi>
and <hi>Entire,</hi> according to the <hi>Size</hi> of the said <hi>Vessels:</hi> so from their
<hi>Position,</hi> doth it grow <hi>Slender</hi> or <hi>Thick.</hi> So, where they keep more
within the compass of a <hi>Ring,</hi> as in <hi>Elm,</hi> and <hi>Ash,</hi> the <hi>Tree,</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
usually grows taller, and less thick. But where the said
<hi>Vessels</hi> are spread more abroad, and especially are postured in <hi>Rays,</hi> as
they are in <hi>Oak,</hi> the <hi>Tree</hi> grows very thick. Because the said <hi>Vessels</hi> thus
standing all along nearer to the <hi>Insertions,</hi> there is a more ready and
copious passage of the <hi>Aer</hi> out of the one into the other; and so the
<hi>Diametral</hi> growth of the <hi>Wood</hi> is more promoted.</p>
                     <p>4. §. LASTLY, from the same general cause it is, That the <hi>Trunks</hi> of
<hi>Vegetables</hi> are either <hi>Round</hi> or <hi>Angular.</hi> Those of all <hi>Trees</hi> are
<hi>Round.</hi> Because the <hi>Barque,</hi> being here thicker, and the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi>
bound up with a greater quantity of <hi>Wood;</hi> the <hi>Aer</hi> hath not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
power to move them, and the <hi>Barque</hi> with them, into those various
<hi>Positions</hi> or <hi>Figurations,</hi> as the <hi>Trunks</hi> of <hi>Herbs</hi> do yield to.</p>
                     <p>5. §. Yet the cause of the various <hi>shapes</hi> of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> is not the
<hi>Aer</hi> alone; but partly, the <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Plants</hi> themselves, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juction
therewith; according to the predominion whereof, and chiefly
of some certain kind of <hi>Salt</hi> or <hi>Salts,</hi> as I shall hereafter<note n="a" place="margin">B. 4. P. 1. Ch. 6.</note> more

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Motions</hi> also of <hi>Trunks</hi> are various. Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
<hi>Four; sc. Ascending, Descending, Horizontal,</hi>
and <hi>Spiral.</hi> The cause of the <hi>Ascent</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> is a
certain <hi>Magnetick Correspendence</hi> betwixt the <hi>Aer</hi> and
the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> of a <hi>Plant;</hi> the <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Tendency</hi>
whereof, the whole <hi>Plant</hi> follows. This I have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
and I think, clearly demonstrated in my
<hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second Books</hi> of the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi> I will here add
this plain <hi>Experiment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. Take a Box of <hi>Moulds,</hi> with a hole bored in the bottom,
wide enough to admit the <hi>Stalk</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> and set it upon stilts half
a yard or more above ground. Then lodg in the <hi>Mould</hi> some <hi>Plant,</hi>
for Example a <hi>Bean,</hi> in such sort, that the <hi>Root</hi> of the <hi>Bean</hi> standing
in the <hi>Moulds</hi> may poynt upwards, the <hi>Stalk</hi> towards the ground.
As the <hi>Plant</hi> grows, it will follow, that at length the <hi>Stalk</hi> will rise
upward, and the <hi>Root,</hi> on the contrary, arch it self downward. Which
evidently shews, That it is not sufficient, that the <hi>Root</hi> hath <hi>Earth</hi> to
shoot into, or that its <hi>Motion</hi> is only an <hi>Appetite</hi> of being therein
lodged, which way soever that be: but that its nature is, though
within the <hi>Earth</hi> already, yet to change its <hi>Position,</hi> and to <hi>move Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi>
And so likewise of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> that it rises, when a <hi>Seed</hi> sprouts,
out of the Ground, not meerly because it hath an <hi>Appetite</hi> of being
in the open <hi>Aer;</hi> for in this Experiment it is so already; yet now makes
a new <hi>Motion</hi> upwards.</p>
                     <p>3. §. BUT although the <hi>Natural Motion</hi> of the <hi>Trunk</hi> be to
<hi>Ascend;</hi> yet is it forced oftentimes to <hi>Descend.</hi> For the <hi>Trunk-Roots</hi>
growing out of some <hi>Plants</hi> near the ground, and shrinking thereinto,
like so many <hi>Ropes,</hi> do pluck the <hi>Trunk</hi> annually lower and lower
into the ground together with them; as may be seen in <hi>Scrophularia,
Jacobaea,</hi> and many other <hi>Plants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. IF these <hi>Trunk-Roots</hi> break out only about the <hi>bottom</hi> of the
<hi>Trunk,</hi> as in the aforesaid <hi>Plants,</hi> then the <hi>Trunk</hi> gradually <hi>Descends</hi>
into the <hi>Earth,</hi> and is turned into a <hi>Root.</hi> But if it be very <hi>slender,</hi> and
the <hi>Trunk-Roots</hi> break forth <hi>all along</hi> it, then it <hi>Creeps</hi> horizontally;
the said <hi>Roots</hi> tethering it, as it trails along, to the ground; as in <hi>Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,
Cinquefoyl, Mint, Scordium,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>5. §. AS to their <hi>Spiral Motion,</hi> it is to be noted; That the <hi>Wood</hi>
of all <hi>Convolvula's</hi> or <hi>Winders,</hi> stands more close and round together in
or near the Center, thereby making a round, and slender <hi>Trunk.</hi> To
the end, it may be more tractable, to the power of the external <hi>Motor,</hi>
what ever that be: and also more secure from breaking by its winding
<hi>Motion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:100350:96"/>
6. §. Wherefore, <hi>Convolvula's</hi> do not wind by any peculiar Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or <hi>Genius,</hi> which other <hi>Trunks</hi> have not; but because their <hi>Parts</hi>
are disposed so, as to render them more sequaceous to the external
<hi>Motor.</hi> Even as the <hi>Claspers</hi> of a <hi>Vine,</hi> having the like <hi>Structure,</hi> have
also a <hi>Motion</hi> of <hi>Convolution:</hi> whereas the <hi>Branches</hi> themselves upon a
contrary account, move in a <hi>straight Line.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. The <hi>Convolution</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> hath been observed only in those that
Climb. But it seems probable, that many others do also <hi>wind;</hi> in
which,<note place="margin">B. 2. P. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ch. 1.</note> the main <hi>Stalk,</hi> is as the <hi>Axis</hi> to the <hi>Branches</hi> round about. Of
which number, I conceive, are all those whose <hi>Roots</hi> are twisted; a
<hi>Motion</hi> we observed in speaking of the <hi>Root.</hi> Whether it be so, or
not the Experiment may easily be made by tying a <hi>Thred</hi> upon any of
the <hi>Branches;</hi> setting down the respect it then hath to any Quarter in
the <hi>Heavens:</hi> for, if it shall appear in two or three Months, to have
changed its Situation towards some other Quarter; it is a certain proof
hereof. And that hereby the <hi>Roots</hi> of many <hi>Plants</hi> become twisted;
the <hi>Motion</hi> beginning in the <hi>Stalk,</hi> and ending at the bottom of the
<hi>Root,</hi> which stands always fixed in the same place.</p>
                     <p>8. §. The <hi>Convolution</hi> of <hi>Trunks,</hi> is made not <hi>one,</hi> but <hi>divers</hi> ways;
some moving by <hi>South</hi> from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West;</hi> and others from <hi>West</hi> to <hi>East.</hi>
Wherefore it seemeth, that as the <hi>Efficient Cause</hi> of <hi>Convolution,</hi> is not
within the <hi>Plant,</hi> but external: so also, that it is not <hi>One,</hi> but that there
are <hi>Two Great Efficients</hi> of this <hi>Motion; sc.</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Moon.</hi>
Some winding together with the <hi>Sun,</hi> in its <hi>Diurnal Motion,</hi> (or, if the
the Earth moves, then, Inclining to the <hi>Sun)</hi> by <hi>South</hi> from <hi>East</hi> to
<hi>West.</hi> And others winding with the <hi>Moon,</hi> in its <hi>Monthly Motion,</hi> from
<hi>West</hi> to <hi>East.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. This possibly, may also be one <hi>sensible</hi> way of distinguishing
betwixt <hi>Solar,</hi> and <hi>Lunar Plants.</hi> Thus far, in general, of the <hi>Motions</hi>
of <hi>Trunks.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. VII. Of the Nature of Timber or Trunks, as they
serve for Mechanick Use.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE last thing I purposed to speak of, is, Those
several <hi>Qualities</hi> of <hi>Timber</hi> or of <hi>Trunks,</hi> by which
they are fitted for <hi>Mechanical Use.</hi> As <hi>Hardness,
Softness, Fastness, Clevesomeness, Toughness, Brittle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Durableness,</hi> or any of the same <hi>Qualities</hi>
compounded. The <hi>Visible Causes</hi> whereof are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
<hi>Partly,</hi> in the <hi>Structure</hi> of the several
<hi>Parts; sc.</hi> the <hi>Insertions, Sap-Vessels</hi> and <hi>Aer-Vessels;</hi> as to the <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Size,</hi> or <hi>Position</hi> of any of them. And <hi>partly,</hi> in the <hi>Nature</hi> of
the <hi>Parts;</hi> I mean such as is <hi>manifest to sense.</hi> According to our clear
and distinct observing of all which Causes, we may understand,
Wherefore any <hi>Wood</hi> is made use of for any certain purpose. And
also, wherein fitly to apply it to further <hi>Use.</hi> In order to which, a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100350:97"/>
compleat History of the <hi>Mechanical Uses</hi> of <hi>Vegetables</hi> would very
much conduce. I shall for the present give some <hi>Instances.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. AS <hi>First,</hi> some <hi>Woods</hi> are <hi>soft,</hi> as <hi>Deal,</hi> and <hi>Sallow.</hi> Yet from
different Causes. <hi>Deal,</hi> from the great <hi>Porosity</hi> of the <hi>Wood</hi> it self,
or the large <hi>Pores</hi> amongst the <hi>Sap-Vessels.</hi> But <hi>Sallow,</hi> from the great
number of <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> spread all over it. And therefore, though they
are both <hi>soft,</hi> yet will not serve for the same purposes; <hi>Sallow</hi> being
well wrought upon, which way soever you cut it: but <hi>Deal,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the white <hi>Deal,</hi> if it be cut cross, it tears, and will never polish
or work smooth.</p>
                     <p>3. §. Again, in <hi>Sallow,</hi> by the equal spreading of the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi>
the <hi>Softness</hi> is equal or alike in all <hi>Parts.</hi> For which cause it maketh
an excellent <hi>Coal</hi> for <hi>Painters Scribets.</hi> Because it doth not only make
a <hi>light Stroak,</hi> but every where <hi>certain;</hi> and so doth not disturb the
even <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Hand.</hi> For the same cause, <hi>Shoomakers</hi> also make
use of it for their <hi>Carving-boards.</hi> Because being every where equally
soft, it turns not the edge of their <hi>Knives,</hi> Which <hi>Deal</hi> would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
do; because though very soft in some places, yet in others 'its
hard; that is to say, on the inner <hi>Verge</hi> of every annual <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Wood,</hi>
where the old <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> grow much more compact and close together.</p>
                     <p>4. §. AGAIN, some <hi>Woods</hi> are <hi>soft,</hi> but not <hi>fast;</hi> others are
<hi>both,</hi> as <hi>Linn:</hi> its <hi>Softness,</hi> depending on the numerousness and equal
spreading of the <hi>Aer-Vessels:</hi> its <hi>Fastness,</hi> on the closeness of the true
<hi>Wood,</hi> and the shortness, and smallness of the <hi>Insertions.</hi> For which
cause, it is of excellent use for many purposes; and particularly, for
<hi>small Sculpture:</hi> such as may sometimes be seen for the Frames of
<hi>Looking-Glasses,</hi> or of smaller <hi>Pictures</hi> in <hi>Water-Colours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. SOME <hi>Woods,</hi> again, are <hi>fast,</hi> and <hi>hard,</hi> as <hi>Elm.</hi> Its
<hi>hardness</hi> depending upon the closeness of the <hi>Wood.</hi> Its <hi>fastness,
Partly,</hi> upon the same cause; and <hi>partly,</hi> on the smalness of the <hi>Inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
as also on the fewness of the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> in proportion with the
<hi>Wood;</hi> and on the <hi>thwart</hi> and <hi>cross Position</hi> of many of them. Hence it
is, that <hi>Elm,</hi> of all others, is the most <hi>Cross-grain'd Timber;</hi> that is,
cleaveth so unevenly, to and fro, according to the <hi>cross Position</hi> of the
said <hi>Vessels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. Hence also it cleaveth the <hi>most Difficultly.</hi> Even then,
when it is without any <hi>Knots.</hi> For which reason it is always used,
as best for the <hi>Hub</hi> of a <hi>great Wheel.</hi> As also for <hi>Water-Pipes,</hi> and for
<hi>Pumps.</hi> Not because it is the most <hi>durable Wood;</hi> but because it
will not <hi>split</hi> or <hi>crack,</hi> either in the <hi>working,</hi> or <hi>afterwards.</hi> For
the very same reason, it is used for <hi>Coffins;</hi> that is, because, it will
not <hi>split</hi> in working: not because it will endure longest under ground;
for <hi>Pales</hi> are always made of <hi>Oak.</hi> So also the <hi>Ladles</hi> and <hi>Soles</hi> of a
<hi>Mill-wheel</hi> are always made of <hi>Elm;</hi> as also the <hi>Keel</hi> of a <hi>Boat, sc.</hi> lest
they should <hi>split:</hi> but the other <hi>Parts</hi> are made of <hi>Oak.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. It may here also be noted, That the <hi>Planks</hi> commonly called
<hi>Groaning-Boards,</hi> lately exposed, as a kind of <hi>Prodigy,</hi> to the view
and hearing of many People, were of <hi>Elm.</hi> The <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> of this
<hi>Wood,</hi> being, though not more numerous, yet more ample, than in
any other <hi>Timber.</hi> So that upon the application of the <hi>Red-hot-Iron,</hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> was usual, and thereby the <hi>Rarifaction</hi> of the <hi>Aer</hi> and <hi>Watery Parts</hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the <hi>Timber;</hi> every <hi>Vessel</hi> became, as it were a little <hi>Wind-Pipe</hi> for
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100350:97"/>
their <hi>Expiration.</hi> And as a great many Drops falling together in a showr
of Rain; so a great many of these <hi>Pipes</hi> playing together, might make
a kind of big or groaning noyse.</p>
                     <p>8. §. AS <hi>Elm,</hi> of all <hi>Woods,</hi> is one of the <hi>fastest;</hi> So, on the
contrary, of all <hi>hard Woods, Oak</hi> is the most <hi>Cleavesome,</hi> or <hi>splitteth</hi>
the most <hi>easily.</hi> The cause whereof is, <hi>partly,</hi> the <hi>Largeness</hi> of the
<hi>Insertions;</hi> and <hi>partly,</hi> the <hi>Diametral</hi> or <hi>Radiated Position</hi> of most of
the <hi>Aer-Vessels:</hi> upon both which accounts, wherever a <hi>crack</hi> is once
begun, 'tis easily continued throughout the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the <hi>Trunk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. AGAIN, some <hi>Woods</hi> are <hi>hard, fast,</hi> and <hi>tough.</hi> So is
<hi>Ash,</hi> and especially <hi>Beech. Hard</hi> and <hi>fast,</hi> from some of the same Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
as <hi>Elm. Tough</hi> not from the <hi>Structure,</hi> but from the <hi>Nature</hi> of the
<hi>Parts;</hi> whose <hi>Principles</hi> are united in a more exact proportion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>London-Cars</hi>
have the <hi>Rings</hi> of their <hi>Wheels</hi> of <hi>Beech;</hi> because it
<hi>tears</hi> more difficulty than even <hi>Ash</hi> it self. Whence also for <hi>large Screws,</hi>
there is no <hi>Wood</hi> like it. But for <hi>Small Screws,</hi> of about an <hi>Inch Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Birch</hi> is the best; as being, though not so <hi>hard,</hi> yet more <hi>tough.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. §. THE more <hi>Brittle</hi> a <hi>Wood</hi> is, 'tis likewise usually the more
<hi>durable.</hi> So <hi>Oak,</hi> which, with respect to its <hi>hardness,</hi> is not a <hi>tough,</hi> but
very <hi>brittle Wood,</hi> is almost as <hi>durable</hi> as any. Whereas <hi>Beech, Birch,</hi>
and the like, although very <hi>tough;</hi> yet for <hi>Duration,</hi> are of no service;
for there are no <hi>Woods</hi> will rot sooner: and therefore, though strong
enough, yet unfit to make any <hi>Standing Parts</hi> of <hi>Building,</hi> or of <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture;</hi>
especially in wet and moist places. Because, these <hi>Woods,</hi>
having a less proportion of <hi>Oyl,</hi> than there is in <hi>Oak;</hi> they are apter
to imbibe the moisture even of a <hi>dank Aer;</hi> by which moisture, they
either <hi>Rot,</hi> or breed <hi>Worms,</hi> which destroy them.</p>
                     <p>11. §. HENCE it is, that what we call the <hi>Heart</hi> of <hi>Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
as it is more <hi>brittle,</hi> so also more <hi>durable; sc.</hi> Because more
<hi>Oylie.</hi> So that which is called the <hi>Sap</hi> of <hi>Oak,</hi> is much more <hi>tough</hi> than
the <hi>Heart,</hi> although the <hi>Heart</hi> be more <hi>durable.</hi> That is to say, the
older the <hi>Wood</hi> is, the <hi>Watery Parts</hi> are the more evapourated, whilst
the <hi>Oylie</hi> still remaine, as a kind of <hi>Tincture</hi> or <hi>Extract</hi> in the <hi>Wood.</hi>
Even as we see, that the older <hi>Seeds</hi> of any one <hi>Kind,</hi> are more <hi>Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi>
than those that are green and young. So that the <hi>Oylie</hi> or <hi>Rosinous
Parts</hi>
of the <hi>Sap,</hi> are a kind of <hi>Embalming</hi> to the <hi>Heart,</hi> or older <hi>Part</hi>
of a <hi>Tree,</hi> securing it from the destructive impressions of the <hi>Aer.</hi> For
which Cause it is, that <hi>Oak, Yew, Cocus, Guajacum,</hi> &amp;c. which are
<hi>Oylie Woods,</hi> have always much <hi>Heart,</hi> whereas <hi>Birch, Alder, Beech,
Maple,</hi> which are very <hi>Unoylie,</hi> have never any <hi>Heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. §. FROM hence likewise we may understand the Cause of
the <hi>Toughness</hi> of <hi>Flax:</hi> what we call <hi>Flax,</hi> being only the <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi>
or <hi>Lignous Fibres</hi> of the <hi>Barque.</hi> And generally, the <hi>Barque</hi> of any
<hi>Tree,</hi> as of <hi>Willow</hi> (whereof are usually made a sort of <hi>Ropes)</hi> is
very <hi>tough.</hi> The <hi>Vessels</hi> being here younger, and less <hi>Oylie</hi> than in the
<hi>Wood.</hi> So likewise <hi>Hemp,</hi> is nothing else but the <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> of the
<hi>Barque</hi> of the <hi>Plant</hi> so called. And <hi>Scotch-Cloath,</hi> is only the <hi>House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery</hi>
of the same <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Barque</hi> of <hi>Nettle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13. §. WHENCE it is very probable, that there are many
other <hi>Plants,</hi> as well as the above named, whereof might be made
good <hi>Tow.</hi> And of some, espcially in some respects, better than of
<hi>Flax</hi> it self. Because that even <hi>Hemp,</hi> although it will not make so
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100350:98"/>
fine a <hi>Staple,</hi> as <hi>Flax</hi> (for all our fine <hi>Hollands</hi> are made of <hi>Flax)</hi> yet
<hi>Flax,</hi> which is but of the same fineness as <hi>Hemp,</hi> will never, by all the
Art yet known, be made so white as <hi>Hemp</hi> is made. The <hi>Qualities</hi>
therefore of the best <hi>Tow,</hi> that can be in Nature, are that the <hi>Staple</hi>
be <hi>long, small, tough,</hi> and <hi>white.</hi> So that if in the <hi>Barque</hi> of any
<hi>Plant,</hi> we can find these <hi>Qualities,</hi> or any of them, to excell; we may
be sure, it will be of better use, in some respects, for the making of
<hi>Cloath,</hi> or other purpose, than <hi>Flax</hi> it self.</p>
                     <p>14. §. I WILL conclude with one <hi>Instance</hi> more, and that is
as to <hi>Grafting.</hi> The good and happy success whereof, doth certainly
depend upon the suitableness or respondence betwixt the several <hi>Parts</hi>
of the <hi>Stock</hi> and <hi>Cyon;</hi> as the <hi>Barque, Wood,</hi> and <hi>Pith;</hi> and that both
as to the <hi>Number, Size,</hi> and <hi>Position</hi> of the said <hi>Parts,</hi> and of their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Pores</hi> or <hi>Vessels:</hi> according to the degrees whereof, the <hi>Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(caeteris paribus)</hi> will be more or less prosperous. So that of all
such <hi>Conjunctions</hi> as are found to be apt and taking, and which some
have learned not without long Practice and Experience; another, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by comparing the <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Trees</hi> together, may with little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and in much less time, inform himself. By the same means, some
<hi>Conjunctions</hi> which seem to be strange, as <hi>Quince</hi> and <hi>Pear, White Thorn</hi>
and <hi>Medlar,</hi> &amp;c. do yet, by the respondence of their <hi>Parts,</hi> as well as
by <hi>Experience,</hi> appear to be good. And there is no doubt, but that
many <hi>Conjunctions</hi> not yet tryed, or not known to have been so, may
upon the same ground, be tryed with good success.</p>
                     <p>15. §. The chief Use of <hi>Grafting</hi> and <hi>Inoculation,</hi> is, That they
<hi>Accelerate</hi> the growth of <hi>Good Fruit.</hi> The <hi>Cause</hi> whereof, is the <hi>Knot,</hi>
which is always made in the <hi>Conjunction.</hi> By means of which, all the
<hi>Sap</hi> is strained, and so ascendeth up into the <hi>Graff</hi> or <hi>Bud,</hi> both <hi>Purer</hi>
and in less <hi>Quantity;</hi> and is therefore better and sooner concocted.
Hence, the smaller the <hi>Fruit</hi> of any <hi>Tree,</hi> though it be not the best, yet
the <hi>Sap</hi> being there, in <hi>less Quantity,</hi> is the <hi>sooner ripe.</hi> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
where the <hi>Sap</hi> ascendeth too freely, it doth not only <hi>retard</hi> the
growth of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> but produceth <hi>Barrenness;</hi> as is seen in those
<hi>luxuriant Branches,</hi> where it runs all up to <hi>Leaves.</hi> Hence also <hi>Vines,</hi>
by <hi>Bleeding,</hi> become more <hi>Fruitful:</hi> that is, by the Effusion of <hi>Part</hi>
of the <hi>Sap,</hi> there is a more easier <hi>melioration</hi> of that which remains.
Even as <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> doth oftentimes produce a more healthful and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Habit</hi> of our own <hi>Bodies.</hi> To conclude, the <hi>lessening</hi> the <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi>
and thereby the <hi>melioriation</hi> of the ascending <hi>Sap,</hi> by <hi>Knots,</hi> is
<hi>Natures</hi> own contrivance; as is seen in <hi>Sugar-Cane, Corn,</hi> and other
<hi>Plants.</hi>

                     <p>But in Discourse upon this Subject, <hi>You</hi> have been pleased

                        <note n="a" place="margin">Lib. 1. Ch. 4.</note> to the <hi>Germen</hi> and
<hi>Leaf.</hi> Since then, I have occasionally made divers
<hi>Remarques</hi> of the same; both with the Naked
Eye, as there, and also with the <hi>Microscope.</hi> The
<hi>Principal</hi> whereof, I shall here set down; without
repeating any from thence; or obliging my self
strictly to the <hi>Order</hi> there used.</p>
                     <p>2. §. That which in a <hi>Germen,</hi> first occurs to the <hi>Eye,</hi> is the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi>
of the <hi>Leaves,</hi> or the various <hi>Methods</hi> which Nature takes to
preserve them from the <hi>Injuries</hi> both of the <hi>Ground,</hi> and of the <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:100350:101"/>
3. §. AND <hi>First,</hi> it is observable of the young <hi>Buds</hi> of <hi>Ammi,</hi>
that lest they should be bruised, or starved, upon their first <hi>Erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
from under the Ground; they are couched, as <hi>Firn</hi> is rowl'd, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
each <hi>Bud,</hi> against the <hi>Base</hi> of the <hi>Stalk</hi> of the foregoing
<hi>Leaves,</hi> and most exactly laid up within the <hi>Membranes</hi> thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced:
Just as the Child in the Womb, lie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> with his <hi>Head</hi> against his
<hi>Knees;</hi> or as it is afterwards embraced with the <hi>Armes</hi> of the
Nurse. And it is a general Rule of Nature, where the <hi>Stalks</hi> of
the <hi>Leaves</hi> are so long, that they cannot lap one over another, and
where no other special <hi>Protection</hi> is provided; for the bottoms of the
<hi>Stalks</hi> to be produced into broad <hi>Membranes,</hi> as Blankets to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<hi>Buds;</hi> as in <hi>Crowfoot, Dovesfoot, Claver, Cransbill, Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,
Yarrow,</hi> and others. And sometimes instead of two <hi>Skins</hi>
lapped one over another, there is one entire <hi>Skin,</hi> produced from the
<hi>Stalk,</hi> in which as within a <hi>Secundine,</hi> the <hi>Bud</hi> is safely shrowded; and
which, in its Growth, it gradually breaks open.</p>
                     <p>4. §. THE same is also observable in <hi>Dock, Sorrel, Bistort,</hi> and
all other <hi>Plants</hi> of this Kindred; with this difference, That every
<hi>Veil</hi> or <hi>Secundine</hi> is not here produced from the <hi>Stalk</hi> of the <hi>Leaf;</hi> but
hath its <hi>Original Distinct</hi> from it. And whereas in the former, every
<hi>Bud</hi> hath only one to it self: in these <hi>Plants,</hi> every lesser <hi>Leaf,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with its own proper <hi>Veil,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 41.</note> is always inclosed, with the next greater
<hi>Leaf,</hi> in another <hi>Veil</hi> common to them both; and both these with the
next, in another; and so on to the greatest. These <hi>Veils</hi> are extream
thin, and have very few <hi>Vessels;</hi> being so many meet transparent
<hi>Skins.</hi> For which reason, there is always found a <hi>Mucilage</hi> or clear
<hi>Gelly,</hi> between every <hi>Leaf,</hi> and its <hi>Veil,</hi> and between <hi>Veil</hi> and <hi>Veil.</hi>
The one, thus preserving the other, (as do the <hi>Humors</hi> and <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes</hi>
of the Eye) from drying and shrinking up, and thereby from
becoming useless for the <hi>Protection</hi> of the <hi>Plant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. THE <hi>Orchis,</hi> and other <hi>Plants</hi> of this kindred, because they
<hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Flower</hi> early, when the mornings are cold, have a double
<hi>Sheath,</hi> or <hi>Blanket</hi> over all. The <hi>Buds</hi> of some <hi>Herbs</hi> (as of <hi>Plantain)</hi>
having no <hi>Hairs</hi> growing on them, are covered with <hi>Hairy Thrums.</hi> And
the <hi>Nettle</hi> hath <hi>Bastard-Leaves,</hi> or <hi>Interfoyls</hi> between <hi>Leaf</hi> and <hi>Leaf,</hi>
for the preservation of its <hi>Stings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. ANOTHER Sort of <hi>Protection</hi> is seen in <hi>Wild Clary,
White Archangel,</hi> and other <hi>Plants</hi> of a like Shape. In which, the
greater <hi>Leaves</hi> do still cover and inclose the lesser, not by being lapped
over them,<note place="margin">Tab. 41.</note> as where the <hi>Leaves</hi> are more numerous, is usual; but by a
<hi>Double Fore-Curl</hi> at the bottom of every two greater <hi>Leaves;</hi> by which
the little <hi>Under-Bud</hi> is embraced, and so kept safe and warm.</p>
                     <p>7. §. THE <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Onions</hi> are all <hi>Pipes</hi> one within another.
These <hi>Pipes</hi> are every where entire, saving about the middle, where
they have a small <hi>Aperture;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 42.</note> common to all of them, even the most
minute in the Centre: not being a forced <hi>Crack,</hi> but a <hi>Door</hi> ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
formed, for the issuing of every lesser <hi>Pipe,</hi> out of a greater.</p>
                     <p>8. §. THE LAST I shall give, is that which is remarkable in
<hi>Common Sumach.</hi> The <hi>Buds</hi> whereof, being exceeding tender, Nature
appears sollicitous in a peculiar manner,<note place="margin">Tab. 41.</note> for their preservation. For
whereas in other <hi>Plants,</hi> they are well enough secured only by standing
behind the <hi>Stalks</hi> of the elder <hi>Leaves:</hi> here they are lodged within the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100350:101"/>
very <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Stalk;</hi> as entirely, as a <hi>Kernel</hi> is within an <hi>Apple,</hi> or
a <hi>Foetus</hi> in the <hi>Womb.</hi> From whence it comes to pass that the <hi>Basis</hi> of
every <hi>Stalk</hi> is extreamly swelled, as going Great with a <hi>Bud.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. UPON THE removal of those <hi>Parts,</hi> which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
for the <hi>Protection;</hi> the <hi>Foulds</hi> and <hi>Composture</hi> of the <hi>Leaves</hi> do
next appear: all which are most aptly suited both to the <hi>Number</hi> and
<hi>Shape</hi> of the <hi>Leaves,</hi> and also their <hi>Position</hi> upon the <hi>Branch.</hi> In the
<hi>First Book</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Ch. 4.</note> I have given Examples of these <hi>Eight Sorts,</hi> se. the
<hi>Plain Lap,</hi> the <hi>Plicature,</hi> the <hi>Duplicature,</hi> the <hi>Multiplicature,</hi> the <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Roll,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 42.</note> the <hi>Double Back-Roll,</hi> the <hi>Double Fore-Role,</hi> and the <hi>Treble-Roll.</hi>
To which I shall add <hi>Four</hi> or <hi>Five</hi> more.</p>
                     <p>10. §. And <hi>First,</hi> in some <hi>Plants,</hi> as <hi>Ground-Ivy, St. Johns Wort,</hi>
and divers others, where the <hi>Leaves</hi> are small, pretty numerous, and
grow by pairs, they have no <hi>Fould,</hi> but stand Flat and Tangent, like
a pair of <hi>Battledores</hi> clapt together.</p>
                     <p>11. §. They have the like <hi>Posture</hi> in <hi>Baum;</hi> saving, that here
the Edges of the <hi>Leaves</hi> are a little <hi>curled</hi> backward. Not <hi>Rolled,</hi> a
<hi>Curl</hi> being but the beginning of a <hi>Roll.</hi> So the several <hi>Labels</hi> of a
<hi>Grounsel-Leaf</hi> are all laid in a <hi>Back-Curl.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. §. The <hi>Leaves</hi> of some <hi>Plants,</hi> as <hi>Horehound, White Lamium,
Nettle,</hi> and others, are likewise only Tangent, but are set with a <hi>Fore-Curle.</hi>
And the several <hi>Labels</hi> or <hi>Scallops</hi> of the <hi>Leaf</hi> of <hi>Common
Crowfoot,</hi> are all <hi>Curled</hi> Inward. But those of <hi>Hepatica aured,</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
into <hi>Double Fore-Rolls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13. §. THE <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Sage, Scabious, Red Lamium, Lychinis
Sylvestris,</hi> and others, are neither couched one over another, as in the
<hi>Bow-Lap;</hi> nor plated, as in the <hi>Flat Lap;</hi> but being loosely foulded, of
every pair of <hi>Leaves,</hi> the half of one is reciprocally received between
the two halfs of another,<note place="margin">Tab. 42.</note> and may therefore be called the <hi>Cleep.
A Position</hi> very well suited to the Smalness of their Number, and the
Equality of their Size, not so well agreeing with the <hi>Bow-Lap;</hi> and
the somewhat inward Posture of the <hi>Fibres,</hi> not allowing the <hi>Flat
Lap.</hi> Sometimes, as in <hi>Syringa,</hi> where the <hi>Leaves</hi> are broader, the
<hi>Cleep</hi> is joyned with a <hi>Fore-Curle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>14. §. THE last I shall mention, is the <hi>Plaite-Roll,</hi> as in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathum
Alpinum,</hi> which some call <hi>English Rhubarb.</hi> The <hi>Leaves</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are so very large, and the <hi>Fibres</hi> so prominent; that besides and
under the two <hi>Back-Rolls,</hi> they are also laid in several <hi>Plaits,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
those <hi>Plaits,</hi> again with lesser ones, all most exquisitely Tucked up
between the said <hi>Fibres:</hi> So, as neither to bruise the same, nor yet to
leave any Vacuity: whereby every <hi>Leaf,</hi> and the whole <hi>Bud,</hi> lie close
and round within their <hi>Veils.</hi>

Thorns</hi> and <hi>Prickles:</hi> of all which, except <hi>Spots,</hi>
I have spoken in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to the <hi>Chapter</hi> of
<hi>Leaves</hi> in the <hi>First Book.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. Of the <hi>Globulets,</hi> it may here be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
noted, That those which are white, and lie
sometimes like a fine Powder upon the <hi>Leaf,</hi>
were once transparent, as in <hi>Bears-Eear;</hi> their
cleer <hi>Liquor</hi> beeing now evaporated to an <hi>Extract</hi>
or <hi>White Flowers.</hi> This, if licked off, will give you the <hi>Tast</hi> of the
more <hi>Essential Content</hi> of the <hi>Plant;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 43.</note> different from that perceived in
chewing the <hi>Leaf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. For the observing of them, it may also be noted, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they often grow on both sides the <hi>Leaf</hi> alike; yet sometimes,
as in <hi>Ground-Ivy,</hi> only or chiefly on the Back-Side. And that in many
<hi>Plants,</hi> where the elder <hi>Leaves</hi> have none; on the young <hi>Buds</hi> they are
very numerous; as in <hi>Corin Tree, Sorrel,</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>4. §. AS for <hi>Spots,</hi> the smaller ones are observable not only in
<hi>St. Johns-worts,</hi> (in which <hi>Plant</hi> only they are commonly taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of) but also in <hi>Rue,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 43.</note> 
                        <hi>Ground-Ivy, Pympernel</hi> or <hi>Anagallis,</hi> and
divers other <hi>Plants,</hi> when held up against the <hi>Light.</hi> The original
whereof seems to be, at least in some, from the <hi>Globulets</hi> above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
that is, when they break and dry away. So the <hi>Spots</hi> of <hi>Rue-Leaves,</hi>
which in the <hi>Reflection</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> look <hi>black,</hi> but upon the <hi>Trajecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
thereof are <hi>transparent,</hi> are so many little <hi>Holes,</hi> pounced half way
through the thickness of the <hi>Leaf,</hi> and seem as made, by the breaking
and drying away of as many <hi>Globulets.</hi> Whence also, as the <hi>Globulets</hi>
are best seen in the younger <hi>Leaves,</hi> so these <hi>Spots</hi> in the elder.</p>
                     <p>5. §. BESIDES these, and some others (as those in <hi>Ladies-Thistle)</hi>
which are Natural to the <hi>Leaf;</hi> there are also some <hi>Spots,</hi> or
rather <hi>Streaks,</hi> which are <hi>Adventitious;</hi> as those in the <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 43.</note>
The Cause whereof, is a small flat <hi>Insect,</hi> of a grey <hi>Colour,</hi> and
about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <hi rend="sup">th</hi> of an Inch long. Which neither ranging in bredth, nor
striking deep into the <hi>Leaf;</hi> eats so much only as lies just before it,
and so runs scudding along betwixt the <hi>Skin</hi> and the <hi>Pulp</hi> of the <hi>Leaf;</hi>
leaving a whitish <hi>Streak</hi> behind it, where the <hi>Skin</hi> is now loose, as the
measure of its Voyage.</p>
                     <p>6. §. THE Original and several kinds of <hi>Thorns,</hi> I have describ'd
in the above said <hi>Appendix.</hi> I only add, that the very <hi>Leaves</hi> of some
<hi>Plants,</hi> if they stand till the second year, are changed into so many
<hi>Thorns,</hi> as in the <hi>Furz.</hi>
                     </p>

7. §. They are of Use, not only for the <hi>Protection</hi> of the <hi>Bud;</hi> but
likewise, for the support of the <hi>Plant;</hi> as is observable in those <hi>Climbers,</hi>
which are neither strong enough to stand of themselves; nor yet, from
their fragility, are capable of winding about another, without being
torn all to pieces. For which end also, these <hi>Thorns</hi> grow not like
<hi>Buds,</hi> erected;<note place="margin">Tab. 43.</note> but poynt all downwards, like so many <hi>Tenters</hi> or
<hi>Hanging-hooks:</hi> as in the <hi>Bramble,</hi> chiefly on the <hi>Stalks;</hi> and in <hi>Clivers,</hi>
also on the <hi>Leaves</hi> themselves; whereby they catch at any Thing that
stands next them; and so, although such slim and feeble <hi>Plants,</hi> yet
easily climb to a very great hight.</p>

if we consider, That all <hi>Leaves</hi> are not alike <hi>Hairy,</hi> nor at all
times, nor in every part: but differently, according to their <hi>Age, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
Texture,</hi> and <hi>Foulding</hi> up. Their <hi>Age;</hi> for there are many
young <hi>Buds</hi> covered with a thick warm <hi>Hair,</hi> which afterwards dries
up and disappears, as useless; as those of the <hi>Vine, Golden Liverwort,</hi>
&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their <hi>Substance;</hi> so those <hi>Buds</hi> which are tenderest, and would
sooner feel the cold, if naked, have the fullest <hi>Hair;</hi> as of <hi>Thistle,
Mullen, Burdock,</hi> and others. Their <hi>Structure;</hi> therefore those <hi>Leaves,</hi>
whose <hi>Fibres</hi> stand more prominent or above their <hi>Surface,</hi> lest the
cold should nip them, are covered with greater Store of <hi>Hair;</hi> as in
<hi>Moth-Mullen, Garden-Clary,</hi> and the like. And their <hi>Fould;</hi> it being
observable, That those <hi>Leaves</hi> which are solded up inward, have little
or no <hi>Hair</hi> on their inner, but only on their Back-Sides, which are
open to the <hi>Aer;</hi> as is visible in <hi>Corin, Warden, Golden Liverwort,</hi>
and others.</p>
                     <p>9. §. Add hereto, That where there is Store of <hi>Hair,</hi> Nature is
the less sollicitous for other <hi>Covers;</hi> and where there is not, she is more.
So the <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Beans</hi> and <hi>Peasen,</hi> of <hi>Nettle, Plantain,</hi> &amp;c. not being
<hi>Hairy,</hi> have each a <hi>Surfoyl,</hi> or else certain <hi>Hairy Thrums,</hi> to protect
them. And those <hi>Plants</hi> which have neither, are such as have a <hi>Hotter
Juyce,</hi> and so less subject to the impressions of <hi>Cold,</hi> as <hi>Speerwort, Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vygrass,
Watercress, Fenil,</hi> and most of the <hi>Umbelliferous</hi> Kind.</p>
                     <p>10. §. <hi>Hair</hi> is of use to preserve young <hi>Buds,</hi> not only, from the
cold <hi>Aer,</hi> but also from too much <hi>Wet;</hi> which, if it were contiguous,
especially in <hi>Winter,</hi> would often rot and destroy them. But being
made to stand off in drops at the ends of the <hi>Hair,</hi> doth not hurt,
but refresh them. Thus doth <hi>Nature</hi> make the meanest Things some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
subserve to the best Ends.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT which in the <hi>Leaf</hi> offers it self next to
be observed, is its <hi>Figure.</hi> This is infinitely va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with the several Kinds of <hi>Plants:</hi> and there
are some, which have <hi>Leaves</hi> (besides the two
first <hi>Dissimilar</hi> ones) of Two Kinds or Two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<hi>Figures;</hi> as the <hi>Bitter-Sweet,</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Little Bell, Valerian, Lady-Smocks,</hi> and
others. For the <hi>Under Leaves</hi> of <hi>Bitter-Sweet,</hi>
are Entire; the Upper, with two <hi>Lobes:</hi> the Under <hi>Leaves</hi> of the
<hi>Little Bell,</hi> like those of <hi>Pancy;</hi> the Upper, like those of <hi>Carnation,</hi>
or of <hi>Sweet-William.</hi> And in some <hi>Plants,</hi> Nature assecteth a Kind
of <hi>Irregularity;</hi> the <hi>Leaves</hi> whereof are of no one certain <hi>Figure;</hi> as
in <hi>Dragon, Peony, Bishops-Weed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>2. §. BUT the <hi>Leaves</hi> of most <hi>Plants,</hi> have a Regular <hi>Figure;</hi>
and this Regularity, both in Length and Circuit, always defineable.
In <hi>Length;</hi> by the Proportion between the several <hi>Leaves</hi> upon one
<hi>Stalk,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 46.</note> or between the several <hi>Lobes</hi> upon one <hi>Leaf.</hi> So the <hi>Leaves</hi>
of <hi>Clematis Sylv. major,</hi> which stand by Ternaries, shorten by equal
<hi>Proportions,</hi> that is to say, if, the chief <hi>Fiber</hi> of each, be divided into
equal <hi>Parts;</hi> their several Lengths are not as Ten, Eight, and Four; but
as Ten, Eight, and Six. So the <hi>Lobes</hi> and <hi>Fibers</hi> of <hi>Clematis Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana
Hederae folio,</hi> of <hi>Artenuisa,</hi> &amp;c. shorten in like manner by equal
Proportions. The same is observable in measuring, upon a <hi>Gooseberry-Leaf,</hi>
from the Poynt of the first <hi>Lobe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 46.</note> to the first <hi>Angle;</hi> from thence,
to the second Poynt; from thence, to the second Angle; and from
thence to the third Poynt.</p>
                     <p>3. §. But in many, the Proportion is different. So in the <hi>Leaves</hi>
of the <hi>Lesser Maple;</hi> the shortning of the <hi>smaller Lobes,</hi> with respect to
the middelmost; is not Equal, but Double to that of the middlemost,
with respect to the Greater. For if their chief <hi>Fibres</hi> be divided into
Equal Parts, they are as Eleven, Nine, and Five. On the contrary,
in the <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Althaea fruticosa Pentaphylloidea,</hi> the middlemost <hi>Lobes</hi>
shorten by a greater Proportion than the Least; all three being as Ten,
Fourteen, and Twenty.</p>
                     <p>4. §. WITH respect to the <hi>Circumserence,</hi> the <hi>Figure</hi> of most
<hi>Leaves</hi> is very Complex. Yet Two things are evident. First, that all
Regular <hi>Leaves,</hi> are desined or measured out by <hi>Circles;</hi> that is, by the
<hi>Arches</hi> or <hi>Segments</hi> of several <hi>Circles,</hi> having either the same, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<hi>Centers</hi> and <hi>Diameters.</hi> Secondly, That the Length of the <hi>Leaf,</hi>
or of the chief <hi>Fiber</hi> thereof, is the <hi>Standard Measure</hi> for the <hi>Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
of these <hi>Circles:</hi> these being either its full Length, or certain
equal parts substracted, or multiplied; as half its Length, or its Length
and half, &amp;c.</p>

5. §. TO make this appear, I shall give several Instances: of some,
where both the Edges are of one Measure; and of others, where they
are different. And of both kinds, where they are measured by fewer,
and where by more <hi>Circles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. The <hi>Leaf</hi> of <hi>Lagopus major fol. pennat.</hi> is measured by One

                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. That of <hi>Orange-Tree,</hi> is also measured by Two <hi>Circles:</hi> but

                        <note place="margin">Tab. 44.</note> but without it. The <hi>Diameter</hi> hereof is just the Length of the

                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. The <hi>Leaf</hi> of the <hi>Venetian Vetch,</hi> is measured by Three <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi>

lessen by an Equal Proportion.</p>
                     <p>10. §. The <hi>Leaf</hi> of <hi>Great Laserwort,</hi> is also measured by
Three <hi>Circles;</hi> all drawn Outward, and one of them Repeated. The
<hi>Diameter</hi> of that next the <hi>Cone,</hi>

                     <p>11. §. That of <hi>Broad Leav'd Laserwort,</hi> is also measured with Three
<hi>Circles;</hi> and one of them repeated with <hi>Opposite Centers.</hi> The <hi>Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of the First,<note place="margin">Tab. 44.</note> is Half the Length of the <hi>Leaf;</hi> of the Second, Twice

That next the <hi>Stalk,</hi> is the same with the First; only drawn

                     <p>12. §. The <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Leaf</hi> of the <hi>Cornelian Cherry,</hi> is exactly that
of the foregoing,<note place="margin">Tab. 44.</note> Inverted: the same measure there beginning at the
<hi>Base,</hi> and ending at the <hi>Cone;</hi> which here begins at the <hi>Cone,</hi> and ends

                     <p>13. §. IN ALL, the foregoing Examples, both the Edges of the
<hi>Leaves</hi> have the same <hi>Measure.</hi> But they have oftentimes, different
ones; as in these that follow.</p>
                     <p>14. §. The <hi>Leaf</hi> of <hi>Althaea fruticosa,</hi> is measured by Three <hi>Circles.</hi> The

                     </p>
                     <p>16. §. That of <hi>Doronicum,</hi> is measured by Three <hi>Circles,</hi> whereof,
one is repeated Once; and another Thrice. The right Edge by Two,
and One repeated. For the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the First or that next the <hi>Cone;</hi>
is the Length of the <hi>Leaf;</hi> the next is the same, but drawn Outward;
the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the Third,<note place="margin">Tab. 45.</note> is Half the Length. The left Edge, by
Three <hi>Circles;</hi> whereof One is repeated on the same Edge, and Two,
the same, as on the other. For the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the first, is the Length
of the <hi>Leaf;</hi> of the Second, Four times the Length; the Third, the
same as the First; and of the Fourth, Half the Length.</p>
                     <p>17. §. Lastly, that of <hi>Mountain Calamint</hi> is measured by Four
<hi>Circles.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 45.</note> The left Edge, by Three <hi>Circles,</hi> of which, the lowermost is
once repeated: the right Edge also by Two; whereof the nether is
likewise once repeated.</p>
                     <p>18. §. It may seem, even from these Instances, no very unobvious
Conclusion; That all <hi>Crooked Lines, Spiral, Helick, Elliptick, Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
Regular,</hi> or <hi>Irregular;</hi> are made up of the <hi>Arches</hi> of <hi>Circles,</hi> having
either the same, or divers <hi>Centers</hi> and <hi>Diameters.</hi> And, as otherwise,
so from the <hi>Contemplation</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> men might first be invited to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical</hi>
Enquirys.</p>
                     <p>19. § TOGETHER with the <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Leaf,</hi> the <hi>Position</hi>
of the <hi>Fibers,</hi> as it is apparent before Diffection, is observable; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
on the back of the <hi>Leaf.</hi> Whereof I shall add, to what I have
said in the <hi>First Book,</hi> the following <hi>Remarques.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>20. §. First, that there are some <hi>Leaves,</hi> in which the first Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
<hi>Fibres</hi> make <hi>Right Angles</hi> with the Great one in the midle: as
the <hi>Great-Maple,</hi> the <hi>Great Celandine, Chondrilla,</hi> and the rest, or many,
of the <hi>Intybous</hi> Kind; with some few others. But that generally all the
chief <hi>Fibers</hi> of a <hi>Leaf,</hi> make <hi>Accute Angles</hi> together: both where they
stand collateral with the midle <hi>Fiber,</hi> as in <hi>Strawberry;</hi> and where they
all part at the <hi>Stalk,</hi> as in <hi>Mallow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>21. §. Again, that of these, there are some few, any two of whose
Defining <hi>Fibres</hi> making two <hi>Rays</hi> of equal Length,<note place="margin">Tab. 46, &amp; 47.</note> take in One Eighth
Part of a <hi>Circle,</hi> as in <hi>Mallow;</hi> and in some one Tenth: but in most
they take in either one Twelfth part, as in <hi>Holy-Oak;</hi> or one Sixth, as
in <hi>Sirynga.</hi> So that where the <hi>Fibres</hi> stand Collateral with one in the
the midle, if you suppose them to be drawn out at <hi>Opposite Angles;</hi>
or where the chief <hi>Fibers</hi> part at the <hi>Stalk,</hi> you only take in the <hi>Stalk;</hi>
you will thereby divide a <hi>Circle</hi> into Eight, Twelve, or Six equal Parts;
as in <hi>Sirynga,</hi> the <hi>Vine</hi> and others. And so likewise, where there are
several <hi>Sprigs</hi> upon one <hi>Stem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 46, 47.</note> as in <hi>Fenil, Hemlock,</hi> and the like:
as will best be understood by the <hi>Figures.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> COME next to observe the several <hi>Parts,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the <hi>Leaf</hi> is composed: and first the <hi>Skin.</hi> This
being stript off the <hi>Leaf,</hi> although to the bare Eye
it looks no otherwise than a <hi>skin</hi> of <hi>Isinglass:</hi> yet
being viewed through a good <hi>Glass,</hi> with a clear
and true Light, and in an advantagious Position; it
appears to consist not only of <hi>Organical Parts,</hi> as
do the <hi>Skins</hi> of <hi>Animals;</hi> but these also Regularly mixed together; that
is, of <hi>Parenchymous</hi> and <hi>Lignous Fibres,</hi> all very curionsly interwoven
as it were,<note place="margin">Tab. 48,</note> into a piece of admirably sine white <hi>Sarcenet:</hi> as in <hi>Flag,
Tulip,</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <p>2. §. From hence, it is easy to conceive how the <hi>Skins</hi> of all
<hi>Plants,</hi> as well as those of <hi>Animals,</hi> are perspirable; <hi>sc.</hi> between the
several <hi>Fibers</hi> of which they consist. But as the <hi>Skins</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi>
especially in some <hi>Parts,</hi> are made with certain open <hi>Pores</hi> or <hi>Orifices,</hi>
either for the Reception, or the Elimination of something for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the <hi>Body:</hi> so likewise the <hi>Skins,</hi> of at least many <hi>Plants,</hi> are
formed with several <hi>Orifices</hi> or <hi>Pass-ports,</hi> either for the better <hi>Avola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Superfluous Sap,</hi> or the <hi>Admission</hi> of <hi>Aer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. THESE <hi>Orifices</hi> are not in all <hi>Leaves</hi> alike; but varied in
<hi>Bigness, Number, Shape,</hi> and <hi>Position:</hi> Serving to the different <hi>Nature</hi>
of the <hi>Plant,</hi> or <hi>Leaf;</hi> and giving the <hi>Leaf,</hi> as it were, a different <hi>Grain.
Princes Feather, i. e.</hi> a Sort of <hi>Sanicle,</hi> they stand only on the Edges
of the <hi>Leaf;</hi> but are very ample. In the <hi>White Lily,</hi> they are <hi>Oval,</hi>
very white, and each surrounded with a slender white <hi>Border.</hi> They
stand about a 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of an Inch distant,<note place="margin">Tab. 48.</note> as they appear through
a good <hi>Glass,</hi> all over the <hi>Leaf,</hi> but not in any regular Order. These
<hi>Orifices</hi> are the cause of the Greyish <hi>Gloss</hi> on the upper side the <hi>Leaf:</hi>
for the Back-side, in which there are none of them, is of a dark
<hi>Sea-Green.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. In the <hi>Leaf</hi> of <hi>Pine,</hi> they are also <hi>Oval,</hi> and about the same
<hi>Bigness</hi> and <hi>Number,</hi> as in that of a <hi>Lily;</hi> yet without a Border. But
their <hi>Position</hi> is very Elegant,<note place="margin">Tab. 48.</note> standing all, most exactly, in <hi>Rank</hi> and
<hi>File</hi> from one end of the <hi>Leaf</hi> to the other.</p>
                     <p>5. §. NEXT TO the <hi>Skin,</hi> lies the <hi>Pulpy</hi> part of the <hi>Leaf;</hi> which
by the same latitude, as <hi>Use</hi> hath taught us in many other Words, I
call the <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> This <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or <hi>Pulp</hi> of the <hi>Leaf,</hi> like the
<hi>Pith,</hi> and all other <hi>Parenchymous Parts</hi> of a <hi>Plant</hi> is made up of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
small <hi>Cylindrick Fibres:</hi> and these <hi>Fibres,</hi> in most <hi>Leaves,</hi>
woven and woun'd up into little <hi>Bladders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. The <hi>Bladders</hi> are here of several Sizes, as in the <hi>Pith:</hi> but
generally more visible in the <hi>Stalk,</hi> than in the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Leaf.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. In some <hi>Leaves,</hi> these <hi>Parenchymous Fibres</hi> are all drawn close

of <hi>Bone-Lace;</hi> in These, as the same <hi>Threds,</hi> in the <hi>Cloth-work.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. The <hi>Pithy Part,</hi> in the <hi>Stalk,</hi> and almost up to the Top of
the chief <hi>Fiber,</hi> in many <hi>Leaves,</hi> is Tubular; even whilst they are yet
Young and Sappy: as in <hi>Sweet Chervil, Hemlock, Endive, Cichory,
Lampsana, Dandelion, Burdock, Daisye, Scorzonera,</hi> and others. And
sometimes the said <hi>Pithy Part</hi> is opened into several little <hi>Pipes,</hi> like so
many <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> above <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> a Foot long; as in the <hi>Common Dock</hi> and the
<hi>Little Spurge,</hi> by some called <hi>Wart-Wort.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. THE <hi>Strings</hi> of the <hi>Leaf,</hi> or those <hi>Fibres</hi> which are visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the bare Eye, are composed of <hi>Vessels</hi> of the Two General
Kinds, <hi>sc,</hi> for <hi>Sap,</hi> and for <hi>Aer.</hi> They are joyntly distributed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>Leaf:</hi> Yet not so, as to run meerly parallel; as in <hi>Animals,</hi>
every <hi>Artery</hi> hath its <hi>Vein:</hi> but the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are every where Inclosed,
or as it were <hi>sheathed</hi> in the <hi>Sap-Vessels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. §. THEIR <hi>Position</hi> is various and regular, not only in the
<hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Leaf,</hi> as is above shewed; but likewise in the <hi>Stalk:</hi> of
which also I have given several Instances in the <hi>First Book.</hi> I shall
here note, and more particularly describe, One or Two more. In the
<hi>Stalk</hi> of a <hi>Mallow-Leaf,</hi> they stand in Six Oblong <hi>Parcels</hi> of equal Size,
and in a <hi>Ring</hi> near the Circuit.<note place="margin">Tab. 49.</note> Whereby the <hi>Stalk</hi> is stronger, the
Growth hereof, before and behind, more equal, and so the posture
of the <hi>Leaf</hi> more erect.</p>
                     <p>11. §. In <hi>Dandelyon,</hi> they stand in <hi>Five Parcels:</hi> of which the
Greater stands a little <hi>behind</hi> the Centre of the <hi>Stalk;</hi> figured into a
very small <hi>Half-Moon</hi> or <hi>Semi-Tube,</hi> whose <hi>Diametre,</hi> through a <hi>Glass,</hi>
is not above <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                        <hi rend="sup">th</hi> of an Inch. The other Four, are extream small <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linders.</hi>
Altogether make an <hi>Angle,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 49.</note> twice as big as that of a V Consonant.
Whereby, although the <hi>Stalk</hi> be strong enough to support the younger
<hi>Leaves;</hi> yet those which are grown longer, and so not only by their
<hi>Bulk,</hi> but their farther Extension from the Center of <hi>Gravity,</hi> are
become more weighty; commonly lie flat on the Ground.</p>
                     <p>12. §. In <hi>Wild Clary,</hi> they stand also in <hi>Five Parcels,</hi> the Greater
stands not <hi>behind,</hi> but <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Center;</hi> making an <hi>Arch,</hi> whose <hi>Chord</hi>
in a <hi>Glass,</hi> is above <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> an Inch long; and belongeth to a <hi>Circle,</hi> whose
<hi>Diameter</hi> is an Inch and half.<note place="margin">Tab. 49.</note> The other Four, are small <hi>Cylinders,</hi> also
different from those in <hi>Dandelion;</hi> the two bigger, there standing
hindmost; but here, the two Less, and the two Bigger, within the
two round <hi>Ridges</hi> of the <hi>Stalk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13. §. From hence it is, that the <hi>Leaves</hi> of this <hi>Plant</hi> have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <hi>Prone</hi> or <hi>Horizontal Posture,</hi> but also make that <hi>Forceable Pressure</hi> on
the Ground, which can by no means be imputed to their <hi>Weight.</hi> For
the <hi>Great Arched-Fibre</hi> standing before the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Stalk,</hi> and
the two Longer Round ones being uppermost, in the <hi>Ridges</hi> of the
<hi>Stalk;</hi> they put on the upper parts thereof to a more full and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Growth, and so to bow the <hi>Leaf</hi> back-ward. And the <hi>Fibrous
Arch</hi> being, though broad, yet almost flat, doth hereby the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
yield to that <hi>Motion.</hi>
                     </p>

14. §. In <hi>Borage,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 40.</note> and <hi>Moth-Mullen,</hi> they stand also in <hi>Five Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels.</hi>
In the former, the largest maketh still a more bulky <hi>Arch,</hi> than
that of <hi>Clary;</hi> being thicker, as broad, and of a lesser <hi>Circle</hi> or more
bowed. But in <hi>Mullein,</hi> it maketh almost an entire Oval.</p>
                     <p>15. §. By means of this <hi>Figuration,</hi> a sufficient number of <hi>Vessels</hi>
for such large <hi>Leaves,</hi> are not only more conveniently Distributed into
them; but also stand more safely in the <hi>Stalk.</hi> For were the <hi>Arch</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
into a <hi>solid Cylinder,</hi> it could not so presently be resolved into
small <hi>Fibers.</hi> And were it laid into a flat <hi>Plate,</hi> or straight out, either
the <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Stalk,</hi> and so of the <hi>Leaf,</hi> must be altered; or else, the
two ends of the <hi>Plate,</hi> would come too near the Circumference of the
<hi>Stalk,</hi> and so be more liable to the <hi>Impressions</hi> of the <hi>Weather:</hi> as may
be observed in cutting the <hi>Stalk</hi> transversly, and by the <hi>Figures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. §. IN the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Leaf,</hi> besides the <hi>Positions</hi> of the <hi>Fibrous
Strings</hi> or <hi>Threds;</hi> above expessed, there is one <hi>Thred,</hi> bigger or less,
which in all <hi>Plants,</hi> runs round the Edge of the <hi>Leaf,</hi> and hems in all the
rest; but can hardly be well observed in any, without stripping off the
<hi>Skin</hi> of the <hi>Leaf.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 50.</note> When the <hi>Fibres</hi> of the <hi>Leaf,</hi> are bigger, or less tender,
as in <hi>Holly,</hi> the <hi>Skin</hi> and the <hi>Pulp</hi> are sometimes found either rotted
off, or eaten away with <hi>Insects;</hi> whereby, both the said surrounding
<hi>Fiber,</hi> and the rest, are all very fairly visible.</p>
                     <p>17. §. THE <hi>Vessels</hi> seem to be continu'd, in the <hi>Leaf,</hi> by being
Ramified out of Greater into Less, as <hi>Veins</hi> or <hi>Arteries</hi> are in <hi>Animals.</hi>
But if the <hi>Skin</hi> and <hi>Pulp</hi> of the <hi>Leaf,</hi> as suppose a <hi>Borage-Leaf</hi> be taken
off, and the <hi>Vessels</hi> laid bare; by the help of a good <hi>Glass,</hi> it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;<note place="margin">Tab. 50.</note>
That they are all of the same Size, every where in the <hi>Leaf;</hi>
and also continued throughout the same, all several and distinct <hi>Pipes</hi> one
from another, as the <hi>Threds</hi> in a <hi>Skein</hi> of <hi>Silk.</hi> And that therefore the
<hi>Distribution</hi> of the <hi>Threds</hi> which the <hi>Vessels</hi> compose, is not the Ramify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Greater <hi>Pipes</hi> into Less; but the dividing a greater Cluster of
<hi>Pipes,</hi> into several lesser Clusters, till at last they come to be single; as
in the <hi>Distribution</hi> of the <hi>Nerves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>18. §. The <hi>Vessels</hi> seem also to be Inosculated, not only side to
side, but the ends of some into the Sides of others. But neither is
this ever really done:<note place="margin">Tab. 50.</note> the lesser <hi>Threds,</hi> being only so far diducted, as
sometimes to stand at <hi>Right-Angles</hi> with the greater. So that they are
Inosculated only End to End or Mouth to Mouth, after they are come
at last to their final distribution.</p>
                     <p>19. §. The <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> are not only, as is said, Existent in the
<hi>Leaves</hi> of all <hi>Plants;</hi> but are herein also discoverable without the help
of <hi>Glasses:</hi> For upon breaking the <hi>Stalk</hi> or chief <hi>Fibers</hi> of a <hi>Leaf;</hi> the
likeness of a sine <hi>Woolly</hi> Substance, or rather of curious small <hi>Cobwebs,</hi>
may be seen to hang at both the broken Ends. This is taken notice of,
only in some few <hi>Plants,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 51, &amp; 52.</note> as in <hi>Scabious,</hi> where it is more visible. But
may also be seen more or less, in most other <hi>Plants,</hi> if the <hi>Leaves</hi> be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tenderly broken: as I have noted near twenty years since; and
thence conjectur'd them a Sort of <hi>Vessel</hi> common to <hi>Plants.</hi> Now this
fine <hi>Wool,</hi> is really a <hi>Skein</hi> of <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> or rather of the <hi>Fibers</hi> of the
<hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> unroaved from their <hi>Spiral Position,</hi> and so drawn out in
Length. As they appear thus unroaved and drawn out at Length, both
to the bare Eye, and through a good <hi>Microscope,</hi> I have represented in
two Exemples, the one a <hi>Scabious Leaf,</hi> the other that of a <hi>Vine.</hi>
                     </p>

20. §. THE <hi>Weftage</hi> of the <hi>Strings</hi> and <hi>Parenchymous Fibers</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
is here made in the same manner, as hath been described in the
<hi>Anatomy</hi> of the <hi>Root,</hi> and <hi>Trunk:</hi> the former being in some Sort as the
<hi>Warp,</hi> the latter as the <hi>Woof</hi> of the <hi>Leaf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>21. §. And one Example we have (it may be more than one)
wherein Nature shews, though not a greater, yet a different <hi>Art;</hi> and
that is the <hi>Palm-Net.</hi> For whereas in other <hi>Plants,</hi> the <hi>Webb</hi> is made
betwixt the <hi>Lignous-Strings</hi> and the <hi>Fibers</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> only vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
through a <hi>Microscope:</hi> here the said <hi>Strings</hi> themselves are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven,
and the <hi>Weftage</hi> apparent to the bare Eye. Of these <hi>Palm-Nets</hi>
or <hi>Sacks,</hi> there are several Sorts. One of them is composed in this
manner. It hath a Fivefold <hi>Series</hi> of <hi>Lignous Strings</hi> or <hi>Fibers.</hi> The
greatest whereof swell out above the rest; and like so many <hi>Ribs,</hi> are
obliquely produced on both hands, so as to encompass the <hi>Sack.</hi> Along
each of these <hi>Ribs,</hi> on the inside the <hi>Sack,</hi> runs a small <hi>Whitish Line;</hi>
being a <hi>Thread</hi> of <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> growing thereto. Betwixt these <hi>Ribs</hi> or
larger <hi>Strings,</hi> there are others much less, Two or Three betwixt <hi>Rib</hi>
and <hi>Rib, Parallelly</hi> interjected. On the inside, there is a Third <hi>Series,</hi>
which is also obliquely produced; but transversly to the former. The
Fourth and Fifth, consist of the smallest <hi>Strings;</hi> not only Transversly
produced, but also Alternately, from the outside to the inside of the
<hi>Sack, &amp; vice versa.</hi> By these two last, all the rest are most elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
woven into one entire and strong piece of Work.</p>

only <hi>live;</hi> there, they <hi>grow</hi> and are put forth.</p>
                     <p>2. §. An <hi>Evergreen,</hi> is made such, either by
the <hi>Toughness</hi> of the <hi>Skin,</hi> and <hi>Closeness</hi> or <hi>Density</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi>
whereby the <hi>Leaf</hi> is better able to endure Cold; as in <hi>Holly:</hi> or by the
extream <hi>Smalness</hi> or <hi>Fewness</hi> of the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> whereby the <hi>Sap</hi> is less
dryed up, and so sufficient, even in <hi>Winter,</hi> for the Nourishment of

                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. The perpetual Growth of a <hi>Plant,</hi> seemeth to depend chiefly
on the Nature of the <hi>Sap.</hi> For all <hi>Juyces</hi> will not ferment alike, nor
with the same degree of <hi>Heat.</hi> So that whereas many <hi>Plants</hi> require a
greater <hi>Heat,</hi> as that of <hi>Summer,</hi> for the fermenting and distribution of
their <hi>Juyces,</hi> and so their growth; the <hi>Warmth</hi> of <hi>Spring</hi> is sufficient for
many others; and for some few, that of <hi>Winter</hi> it self.</p>
                     <p>4. §. AS TO the <hi>Time</hi> wherein the <hi>Leaves</hi> are formed; First,
it is very probable, That in those <hi>Plants</hi> which have <hi>Leaves</hi> (besides
the <hi>Dissimilar)</hi> of Two distinct <hi>Figures,</hi> as hath the Little Common
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100350:106"/>
                        <hi>Bell,</hi> and some others; the <hi>Under-Leaves,</hi> which differ in Shape from
the rest, are all at first formed in the <hi>Plume,</hi> before it begins to <hi>sprout;</hi>
and the rest afterwards; That is to say, that the former <hi>Leaves,</hi> are all
formed (out of <hi>Sap</hi> from the <hi>Trunk)</hi> with the <hi>Seed</hi> it self, and so
compose one Principal <hi>Part</hi> thereof, <hi>sc.</hi> the <hi>Plume:</hi> the latter, not till
after the <hi>Seed</hi> is sow'n, and so the <hi>Plume</hi> supply'd with <hi>Sap</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
from the <hi>Root.</hi> Which <hi>Sap,</hi> it seems, is so far different from
the former, as sometimes to produce a different Sort of <hi>Leaves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. SECONDLY, of the <hi>Buds</hi> of all <hi>Trees,</hi> and of <hi>Perenni-Stalks,</hi>
it appears, That they consist of a great number of <hi>Leaves,</hi> all
perfectly formed to the Centre; where, notwithstanding, they are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
not half so big as a <hi>Cheese-Mite.</hi> So that all the <hi>Leaves</hi> which
stand upon a <hi>Branch</hi> or <hi>Cien</hi> of one whole Years Growth, were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
existent in the <hi>Bud.</hi> It is also very observable, That although
these <hi>Buds</hi> begin to be expanded not till <hi>Spring,</hi> yet are they entirely
Formed, as to all their <hi>Integral Parts,</hi> in the <hi>Autumn</hi> foregoing. So
that the whole Stock of <hi>Leaves</hi> which grow upon a <hi>Tree,</hi> or any <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennial
Stalk,</hi> this year; were made, or actually in being, the last
year. A greater <hi>Heat,</hi> more subtilized <hi>Aer,</hi> and better concocted

Successive <hi>Generations</hi> of <hi>Buds,</hi> one under another in one year;
although I have not made the Remarque, yet am apt to believe, That
as the <hi>Leaves</hi> in every <hi>Bud</hi> are all formed together, as in other <hi>Plants:</hi>
so likewise, that the Successive <hi>Generations</hi> of the <hi>Under-Buds,</hi> begin at

                        </note> supposed, the chief Governing <hi>Principle,</hi> to be the <hi>Saline,</hi>
whether <hi>Alkaline, Acid,</hi> or of any other Kind: being in some sort as
the <hi>Mold</hi> of a <hi>Button,</hi> to which the other <hi>Principles,</hi> as its <hi>Attire,</hi> do

as the <hi>Flesh</hi> which covers them.</p>
                     <p>4. §. A further Argument hereof may be deduced from the <hi>Cuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
and other <hi>Concretions,</hi> commonly called <hi>Mothers,</hi> in Distill'd <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

a tendence to <hi>Vegetation;</hi> and many of them are true <hi>Vegetables</hi>
in their Kind; as shall hereafter be seen. Now the <hi>Liquors,</hi> in which
these are generated, do always, wholly or in part, lose their <hi>Tast</hi> and
<hi>Smell,</hi> and so become <hi>Vapid.</hi> The more sensible <hi>Principles</hi> therein
having made their <hi>Transit</hi> from the <hi>Fluid,</hi> into the <hi>Concrete Parts.</hi> So,
I have known, sometimes, <hi>Vinegar</hi> it self, to become by these <hi>Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
almost as <hi>Tastless</hi> as Common <hi>Water.</hi> Whereby it seems evident,
That of <hi>Vegetable Principles,</hi> there are some, more Masterly than others:
and that of these, the <hi>Saline</hi> is the chief. The same is likewise argued,
from the frequent Experiment of many good Husband-men; that most
<hi>Bodies</hi> which abound with <hi>Salt,</hi> are the greatest <hi>Nourishers</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. This <hi>Saline Principle,</hi> as is above hinted, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
a <hi>Generik</hi> Name, under which divers <hi>Species</hi> are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and of some whereof, it is always compounded, as in other <hi>Bodies,</hi>
so in <hi>Plants.</hi> As shall be made to appear, by divers Experiments, when
we come, hereafter, to speak of <hi>Vegetable Salts.</hi> Whereby we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted,
yet further to enquire, What are the <hi>Princinples</hi> of this <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. NOW these seem to be Four; a <hi>Nitrous,</hi> an <hi>Acid,</hi> an <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi>
and a <hi>Marine.</hi> The <hi>Admixture</hi> of the First, is argu'd from the
Place, which Nature hath assigned for the <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Growth</hi> of
most <hi>Plants, sc.</hi> neither in <hi>Caverns</hi> under Ground, as for <hi>Minerals;</hi> nor
above it, as for <hi>Animals;</hi> but the Surface of the Earth, where this
Sort of <hi>Salt</hi> is copiously bred. And doth therefore prove, not only a
<hi>Mixture,</hi> but a good Proportion hereof with the other <hi>Principles</hi> of a
<hi>Plant.</hi> Hence it is, that <hi>Dew</hi> or <hi>Water</hi> on <hi>Windows</hi> or Plain and Smooth
<hi>Tables,</hi> by virtue of a <hi>Nitro-Aerial Salt,</hi> is often frozen into the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of little <hi>Shrubs.</hi> And the like <hi>Figure</hi> I have often seen in a well
filtred <hi>Solution</hi> of the <hi>Salt</hi> of any of our <hi>Purging Waters,</hi> as of <hi>Epsom,</hi>
&amp;c. being set to <hi>shoot.</hi> Produced, as I conceive, by the <hi>Nitre,</hi> which
with the <hi>Rain</hi> or other <hi>Waters,</hi> is washed down from the <hi>Surface</hi> of the
<hi>Earth,</hi> and so mixed with the <hi>Mineral Salts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. The other Three <hi>Salts</hi> are exhibited, by the several ways of
Resolving the <hi>Principles</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi> Many <hi>Plants,</hi> even in their <hi>Natural
Estate,</hi> do yield an <hi>Acid Juyce.</hi> And the <hi>Juyces</hi> of many more, by <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,</hi>
will become <hi>Acid.</hi> And most, by <hi>Distillation</hi> in a <hi>Sand-Furnace,</hi>
yield an <hi>Accid Liquor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. By <hi>Calcination,</hi> all Sorts of <hi>Plants,</hi> yield more or less, both of
a <hi>Fixed</hi> and a <hi>Volatile Alkaly:</hi> the former, in the <hi>Ashes;</hi> the latter, in the
<hi>Soot.</hi> And, at least the generality, by <hi>Fermentation</hi> also, yield a <hi>Volatile</hi>
one; or such a kind of <hi>Salt,</hi> which, whether we call an <hi>Urinous,</hi> or
otherwise, hath the like <hi>Odour</hi> and <hi>Tast</hi> with that of <hi>Urine, Harts-Horn,
Soot,</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="159" facs="tcp:100350:107"/>
9. §. The <hi>Marine,</hi> is obtained no other way, that I know of, but
from a Solution of the <hi>Alkaline,</hi> upon its being exposed to the <hi>Aer.</hi>
The process wherof, I shall particularly set down in a following <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse.</hi>
Of these <hi>Salts,</hi> mixed in a certain proportion, together, and
also Impregnated with some of the other <hi>Active Principles</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi>
and not without an <hi>Admixture</hi> of some <hi>Parts</hi> from the <hi>Aer;</hi> I suppose,
that which I call the <hi>Essential,</hi> is produced: of which, I shall also give
an account in the same <hi>Discourse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. §. ALL THE Four <hi>Salts</hi> above mentioned, seem in their <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
to have a share in the <hi>Formation</hi> of a <hi>Leaf,</hi> or other <hi>Part</hi> of a <hi>Plant:</hi>
And first of all, the <hi>Marine.</hi> For all <hi>Generations</hi> are made in some
<hi>Fluid:</hi> But in every <hi>Fluid</hi> there is a perpetual <hi>Intestive Motion</hi> of
<hi>Parts.</hi> So that the first Intention of <hi>Nature</hi> is, That some of those
<hi>Parts</hi> be disposed to <hi>Rest.</hi> Now of all the <hi>Principles</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> there
are none hereunto more disposed, than their <hi>Salts;</hi> whose <hi>Particles,</hi>
being figu'rd with plain Sides, as often as they touch Side to Side, like
two <hi>Marbles</hi> exquisitely polished, they will adhere together. And the
<hi>Particles</hi> of <hi>Marine Salt,</hi> being <hi>Cubick;</hi> and so, with respect to their <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,</hi>
of greater <hi>Bulk</hi> than those of any other <hi>Salt;</hi> they will hereby, be
most and first of all disposed to <hi>Rest;</hi> and so become, as it were, the
Foundation of the following <hi>Superstructure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. THE Second Intention of Nature is, That the <hi>Particles</hi> be
brought to <hi>Rest,</hi> in a certain <hi>Position,</hi> agreeable to the <hi>Figure</hi> of the
<hi>Parts</hi> which are to be formed. And therefore in the next place, all
those <hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Plant</hi> which are truly <hi>Lignous,</hi> by the <hi>Marine Salt,</hi>
with the assistance of the <hi>Alkaline,</hi> but especially of the <hi>Nitrous,</hi> are
made to shoot out in Length,<note place="margin">Tab. 53.</note> or into an innumerable company of small
<hi>Cylindrick Fibres:</hi> these <hi>Salts</hi> being, altogether, sturdy enough to resist
those <hi>Impulses</hi> which might incline them to conform to any other <hi>Figure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. §. THE next Intention is, That these <hi>Fibres,</hi> at the same time
in which they are formed, may likewise receive such a <hi>Posture</hi> as will
best answer the indented <hi>Shape</hi> of the <hi>Leaf.</hi> Which <hi>Posture,</hi> although
in the <hi>Growth</hi> of the <hi>Leaf</hi> it is much Govern'd by the <hi>Aer-Vessels;</hi> yet
in the <hi>Generation</hi> hereof, seems to be first determined by the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<hi>Salts,</hi> according to their several <hi>Angles,</hi> whereby they are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
applicable one to another.</p>
                     <p>13. §. Now all the <hi>Sides</hi> of the <hi>Marine Salt,</hi> and the <hi>Sides</hi> and the
<hi>Ends</hi> of the <hi>Nitrous,</hi> properly so called, stand at <hi>Right Angles.</hi> And
it is very probable, from the <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Crystalls</hi> in <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Blood,</hi>
and some other <hi>Bodies,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 53.</note> that the <hi>Particles</hi> of the <hi>Alkaline</hi> are Square at
one End, and Poynted at the other. And those of the <hi>Acid,</hi> at both;
And that, withal, they are Shorter and more Slender.</p>
                     <p>14. §. It should therefore seem, That where the <hi>Alkaline Salt</hi> is
any way predominant, and that the <hi>Particles</hi> thereof are placed End to
End;<note place="margin">Tab. 53.</note> there the <hi>Lignous Fibres</hi> (as the larger ones in many <hi>Leaves)</hi>
declining their parallel <hi>Growth,</hi> begin to shoot out obliquely, or at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles</hi>
one with another, and those <hi>Acute.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="160" facs="tcp:100350:108"/>
15. §. If the same <hi>Salt</hi> be predominant, and some of its <hi>Particles</hi>
placed, with the Pointed End of one, to the Side of another, or the
Square End of one,<note place="margin">Tab. 53.</note> to the Poynted End of another; there the said <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi>
begin to shoot at <hi>Angles</hi> less <hi>Acute.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. §. But if either the <hi>Marine</hi> or <hi>Nitrous Salt</hi> is predominant; or
some <hi>Particles</hi> of the <hi>Alkaline,</hi> are placed with the Square End of one,
to the Side of another;<note place="margin">Tab. 53.</note> there the <hi>Fibres</hi> begin to make, not <hi>Acute,</hi> but
<hi>Right Angles;</hi> as do the greater <hi>Fibres,</hi> in some <hi>Leaves;</hi> and the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
in all.</p>
                     <p>17. §. IN the same manner, the <hi>Fibre</hi> in the Circumference of
the <hi>Leaf</hi> is also governed; the <hi>Particles</hi> of the said <hi>Salt,</hi> being reducea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
not only to any <hi>Angle,</hi> but also to any <hi>Circle,</hi> or other <hi>Crooked
Line,</hi> as they are variously applyed. For if the <hi>major part</hi> be applied
End to End,<note place="margin">Tab. 53.</note> and only every Third or Fourth applied End to Side, they
produce a great <hi>Circle.</hi> But if the Poynted End of each, be set to the
Side of another, they make a less. And if the Application be the same,
but to the contrary Side, they thence begin a new <hi>Circle</hi> with the
same <hi>Diameter,</hi> but with another <hi>Center,</hi> answerable to the intended
<hi>Shape</hi> of the <hi>Leaf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>18. §. AFTER the same manner, the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> may be formed by
the <hi>Particles</hi> of the <hi>Acid Salt.</hi> Which, without being supposed to be
crooked (as those of the <hi>Aer,</hi> at least the compounded ones, probably
be) only by applying the lesser Side of one, to the greater Side of
another, will also be reduced to any either <hi>Circular</hi> or <hi>Spiral Line.</hi>
And so,<note place="margin">Tab. 53.</note> likewise, for the production of the winding <hi>Fibres,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> and other <hi>Parenchymous Parts</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>19. §. Thus doth <hi>Nature</hi> every where <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>.</note> And the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Discourse of <hi>Leaves,</hi> will excuse me from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
particulars, common to <hi>These</hi> and the <hi>Flower.</hi>
I shall here therefore remarque some things not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, or but <hi>in transitu,</hi> and such as
are moreparticular to the <hi>Flower.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. And First, it may be noted; That where the <hi>Leaves</hi> of the
<hi>Flower</hi> are few; those of the <hi>Empalement</hi> or <hi>Green Border,</hi> are either
of the same Number, or just half as many, whether even, or odd. So
in <hi>Leucanthenum</hi> and <hi>Chickweed,</hi> there are Five <hi>Leaves;</hi> in the former
Five <hi>Empalers;</hi> in the latter, Ten. In Great <hi>Celandine,</hi> there are
Four <hi>Leaves,</hi> and but Two <hi>Empalers;</hi> and so in <hi>Poppy.</hi> The <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick</hi>
of <hi>Nature</hi> being every where suitable to Her <hi>Geometry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3, §. Of this <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Flower</hi> it is likewise observable, That
it is rarely, if ever, entire or one piece, but parted into divers little
<hi>Leasy Pales,</hi> especially in all <hi>Flowers</hi> with the <hi>Florid Attire,</hi> as of <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gold,
Daisy</hi> and the like; being so numerous, as to make a <hi>Double,</hi> and
often a <hi>Treble, Quadruple</hi> or <hi>Quintuple Border.</hi> Whereby they are apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
designed, not only to <hi>protect</hi> the <hi>Leaves</hi> of the <hi>Flower</hi> in the <hi>Bud;</hi>
and after their Expansion, to keep them tite: but also, by receding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <hi>Bredthways,</hi> one from another, and so making a greater <hi>Circle,</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
to give way for the full Growth and safe spreading of the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</hi>
Which, in regard it consists of <hi>Parts</hi> so exquisitely tender, were
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100350:110"/>
it pinched up too close, would be killed or spoyled before it came to
the <hi>Birth.</hi> As <hi>Teeming Women,</hi> gradually slaken their <hi>Laces;</hi> or as
<hi>Taylors</hi> use to split their <hi>Stomachers</hi> into several <hi>Lappets,</hi> to spread, as
their <hi>Belly</hi> rises.</p>
                     <p>4. §. Nor is the <hi>Posture</hi> of the <hi>Parts</hi> in the <hi>Empalement</hi> less suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
not being filed one just over another, but alternately. Whereby
the <hi>Pales</hi> or <hi>Pannciles</hi> of every <hi>Under-Order,</hi> serve to stop up the gaps
made by the <hi>Recess</hi> of the <hi>Upper.</hi> And so, notwithstanding they all
make more roome, yet all conspire to keep the <hi>Aer</hi> out.</p>
                     <p>5. §. It is also worth the notice, That, for the same purpose, the
Edges at least, of the several <hi>Pales,</hi> are neither <hi>Fibrous,</hi> nor <hi>Pulpy;</hi> but
so many extream fine transparent <hi>Skins,</hi> as in <hi>Chamemile.</hi> Whereby
they close so exactly one over another, that it is impossible for any <hi>Aer</hi>
to creep in, or any <hi>Steams</hi> useful to the <hi>Attire</hi> or <hi>Seed,</hi> over hastily to
perspire. As we use, when we have put a <hi>Cork</hi> into a <hi>Bottle,</hi> to tie a
<hi>Bladder</hi> over it.</p>

Sort,<note place="margin">Tab. 54.</note> as is most agreeable to their own <hi>Shape,</hi> and
that of their inclosed <hi>Attire:</hi> whereof I have
given Instances in the <hi>Fist Book.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ch. 5.</note> I shall here
add some further <hi>Remarques.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. The <hi>Leaves</hi> of the <hi>Flower</hi> of <hi>Blatta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
although of different <hi>Size</hi> and <hi>Shape;</hi> are
so lapped one over another,<note place="margin">Tab. 54.</note> as to make an
<hi>Equilateral Pentangle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. The <hi>Spiral Fold,</hi> which is proper to the <hi>Flower,</hi> and never
seen in the <hi>Green Leaves;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 54.</note> as it is it self immediately visible on the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi>
so by cutting off the top of the <hi>Flower</hi> before it is expanded,
seems also to make a <hi>Helix;</hi> as in <hi>Perwincle,</hi> the larger <hi>Convolvulus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>4. §. In some <hi>Flowers,</hi> where the <hi>Attire</hi> is lofty or spreading, as in
<hi>Holioak,</hi> together with the <hi>Spiral Fold,</hi> the <hi>Leaves</hi> are all at the top
tacked down a little; thereby making a blunter <hi>Cone,</hi> and so a more
ample <hi>Pyramid</hi> for the inclosed <hi>Attire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. In <hi>Poppy,</hi> although the <hi>Leaves</hi> are extraodinary broad, yet
being but few, and inclosing a small <hi>Attire;</hi> they could not be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to any regular <hi>Fold,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 54.</note> without leaving such a <hi>Vacuity,</hi> as by being
filled with <hi>Aer,</hi> might be prejudicial to the <hi>Seed.</hi> For which reason,
they are cramb'd up within the <hi>Empalement</hi> by hundreds of little
<hi>Wrinckles</hi> or <hi>Puckers;</hi> as if Three or Four fine <hi>Cambrick Handcherchifs</hi>
were thrust into ones <hi>Pocket.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:100350:110"/>
6. §. In <hi>Ladies-Bower,</hi> the <hi>Leaves</hi> are neither laped one over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as is most usual,<note place="margin">Tab. 54.</note> nor set Edge to Edge, as sometimes, but Side
to Side, answerable to their <hi>Shape,</hi> and the <hi>Distribution</hi> of their <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres.</hi>
Their broad <hi>Tops</hi> being also rowled up so as to make a <hi>Cone.</hi>
In <hi>Ladys-Looking-Glass,</hi> they stand also Side to Side, but in a different
manner: in the Former with the Sides standing inward, but here,
bearing outward.</p>
                     <p>7. §. In the <hi>Marvel</hi> of <hi>Peru,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 54.</note> the <hi>Fold</hi> is likewise very peculiar.
For, besides the several <hi>Plates,</hi> about Six, whereby the <hi>Flower</hi> is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
in the Midle; the <hi>Top</hi> of it is also gathered up by as many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<hi>Plates,</hi> underneath the former; and these <hi>rowled</hi> or <hi>wreathed</hi> up

                     <p>8. §. OF the <hi>Hairs</hi> upon <hi>Flowers</hi> and their <hi>Use</hi> to the <hi>Attire,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ch. 5.</note> I
have also spoken in the <hi>First Book.</hi> I shall here add, That they are
likewise of <hi>Use</hi> to the <hi>Leaves</hi> themselves, that is, for their closer and
faster <hi>Conjunction.</hi> For of some <hi>Flowers</hi> it is observable, That they
are all over <hi>smooth,</hi> saving on their Edges, which are border'd with
<hi>Fringes</hi> of <hi>Hair;</hi>

                           </gap>ish Broome, Dulcamara,</hi> and others: In
which, the <hi>Hairs</hi> on the Edge of one <hi>Leaf,</hi> are so complicated, or at
least indented, with those of another, that all the <hi>Leaves</hi> seem to be
but one piece. <hi>Nature</hi> seeing it fit, by this meanss to tie them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
lest they should be expanded before it be due time.</p>
                     <p>9. §. Many <hi>Flowers</hi> instead of <hi>Hairs,</hi> are beset round about, with
a great Number of small <hi>Parts,</hi> not ending in a <hi>Poynt,</hi> but having a
<hi>Head.</hi> Sometimes oval, as in <hi>Snap-Dragon,</hi> like the <hi>Horns</hi> of a <hi>Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly,</hi>
or a <hi>Plummers Sodering-Iron.</hi> But usually <hi>Globular,</hi> as in <hi>Deadly
Nightshade,</hi> like so many little <hi>Mushrooms</hi> sprouting out of the
<hi>Flower.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. §. Out of these <hi>Heads,</hi> doth sometimes issue a <hi>Gummy</hi> or <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samick
Juyce.</hi> From whence proceeds that <hi>Clamminess</hi> of some <hi>Flowers,</hi>
whereby, being handled they stick to our <hi>Fingers,</hi> as do those of <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria,</hi>
and of <hi>Marigold;</hi> and those of <hi>Colus Jovis,</hi> where the said <hi>Heads</hi>
are so <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>succulent,</hi> that they resemble so many little <hi>Drops</hi> of
<hi>Balsame.</hi> The <hi>Clamminess</hi> which is felt upon fresh <hi>Carduus,</hi> may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
proceed from the like <hi>Cause.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. §. THE <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>Leaves</hi> of the <hi>Flower</hi> hath been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Learned Sir <hi>Thomas Brown,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Treat. of the <hi>Quinc.</hi>
                        </note> to be usually <hi>Five.</hi> And this
Nature so far affecteth, that many times where the <hi>Leaves</hi> of the same
<hi>Flower</hi> are of a different <hi>Size,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 54.</note> yet they keep to this <hi>Number,</hi> as in
<hi>Blattaria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. §. I also add, That even those <hi>Flowers,</hi> which are not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
parted into <hi>Leaves,</hi> have yet their <hi>Tops</hi> usually divided into <hi>Five</hi>
great <hi>Scallops;</hi> as those of <hi>Toad-Flax, Snap-Dragon, Coded-Arsmart,
Clary, Broom,</hi> and others. And when the <hi>Flower</hi> hath more than <hi>Five,</hi>
even many times <hi>Five Leaves;</hi> yet the <hi>Top</hi> of each <hi>Leaf</hi> is indented into
<hi>Five Parts;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 54.</note> as in <hi>Scorzonera, Cichory,</hi> and all the <hi>Intybous Kind,</hi> with
many others.</p>
                     <p>13. §. From whence and other like <hi>Instances,</hi> it may seem, That
there is some certain <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Salt</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> and that in most <hi>Plants,</hi>
of whose <hi>Agency</hi> there are still some <hi>Footsteps</hi> or other in the
<hi>Flower.</hi>

14. §. The <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>Leaves,</hi> as hath been said, is commonly
<hi>Five.</hi> Yet some <hi>Flowers</hi> have fewer, and some more, and that with
Constancy, in divers <hi>Numbers,</hi> from <hi>One</hi> to <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Twenty;</hi> perhaps
in all, so far. The <hi>Flower</hi> of <hi>Acanthus Syriacus,</hi> is in a manner one
single <hi>Leaf,</hi> that of <hi>Monks-Rubarb, Three-Leav'd;</hi> of <hi>Poppy, Cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort,
Radish,</hi> and many others, <hi>Four-Leav'd;</hi> the greater <hi>Number</hi> of
<hi>Flowers, Five-Leav'd;</hi> of <hi>White Hellebore, Tulip, Onion,</hi> and most
<hi>Plants</hi> with <hi>Bulbous Roots, Six-Leav'd;</hi> of <hi>Wild-Crowfoot, Seven-Leav'd;</hi>
of <hi>French Marigold,</hi> commonly <hi>Eight-Leav'd;</hi> of <hi>Flower-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luce,
Nine-Leav'd;</hi> of <hi>Chickweed, Ladies-Mantle, Ten-Leav'd;</hi> of St.
<hi>James's Wort, Thirteen-Leav'd;</hi> and I think of <hi>Febrifuga, Cotula, Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum,
Corn-Marigold,</hi> with others; and of <hi>Chamemile, Buphthal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi>
and some few more, the <hi>Leaves</hi> are commonly <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Twenty.</hi>
In that of St. <hi>James's Wort,</hi> the <hi>Number</hi> is so constant that there is
scarce <hi>One Flower</hi> in <hi>Forty,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 55.</note> wherein the <hi>Leaves</hi> are more or fewer than
<hi>Thirteen,</hi> Divers of which <hi>Numbers,</hi> seem also to have some relation to
the <hi>Number</hi> 5. For 9, is Twice; 13, Thrice; and 25, Five times 5 run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into it self.</p>
                     <p>15. §. THE <hi>Constituent Parts</hi> of the <hi>Flower</hi> are the same as those
of the <hi>Leaf, sc.</hi> the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or <hi>Pulp,</hi> and the <hi>Vessels.</hi> But in the <hi>Basis</hi>
or bottom of the <hi>Flower,</hi> the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is commonly much more <hi>spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi>
and <hi>dry,</hi> than in the <hi>Leaves;</hi> conteining, after the <hi>Flower</hi> is open'd,
little or no <hi>Sap,</hi> but only a dry and warm <hi>Aer.</hi> Which standing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
under the <hi>Seed,</hi> hastens the <hi>Maturation</hi> or due <hi>Exiccation</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
as we use to dry <hi>Maulted Barly</hi> over a warm <hi>Killn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. §. The <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Flower,</hi> are both for <hi>Sap</hi> and for <hi>Aer,</hi> as
well as in other <hi>Parts.</hi> And both of them sometimes, even in the <hi>Skin</hi>
of the <hi>Flower;</hi> as may be argued from its being stained with divers
<hi>Colours;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">B. 2. P. 2. §. 65, 66, 67.</note> produced as hath formerly been shewed, by the mixed
<hi>Tinctures</hi> of the said <hi>Vessels.</hi> These <hi>Colours,</hi> in many <hi>Flowers,</hi> as <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips,</hi>
as they are in the <hi>Skin</hi> it self, so therein only; the <hi>Pulp</hi> of the
<hi>Leaf</hi> being white.</p>
                     <p>17. §. The <hi>Lignous</hi> or <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> are fewer, and the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
in the <hi>Flower,</hi> than in the <hi>Leaf.</hi> And therefore it is very difficult
to observe the latter by <hi>Glasses;</hi> especially the <hi>Proportion</hi> which they
hold to the other <hi>Parts.</hi> But if you break the <hi>Leaves</hi> of some <hi>Flowers,</hi>
with very great gentleness; they may hereby be <hi>Unroaved</hi> or <hi>drawn
out,</hi> as in the <hi>Green Leaves,</hi> to some visible length; and their different
<hi>Number</hi> in divers <hi>Flowers</hi> may be discerned.</p>
                     <p>18. §. THE <hi>Use</hi> of the <hi>Flower</hi> or of the <hi>Foliature</hi> whereof we
are speaking,<note place="margin">B. 1. Ch. 5.</note> is various; as hath formerly been shewed. I now only
add, That one <hi>Use</hi> hereof seemeth to be, for the <hi>Separation</hi> of the
more <hi>Volatile</hi> and stronger <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the <hi>Plant.</hi> That so the <hi>Seed,</hi>
which lyeth within or next it, may be so much the milder, and the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
thereof more fixed and concentred. And this, both for its bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Duration</hi> till the time of <hi>Sowing;</hi> and also, that its <hi>Fermentation,</hi>
when it is sow'n, may not be too hot and precipitate; but suitable to
so slow and equal a motion, as is the <hi>Vegetation</hi> of a <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>19. §. And that this <hi>Sulphur</hi> is separated and discharged by the
<hi>Flower,</hi> seems evident, not only from the <hi>Strength</hi> of its <hi>Odeur,</hi> above
that of the other <hi>Parts;</hi> but likewise, in that many times where there
is no <hi>Flower,</hi> or that very small, the <hi>Seed,</hi> that is its <hi>Cover,</hi> is in the <hi>Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliferous
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100350:111"/>
Kind,</hi> is the more odorous. And therefore also, the <hi>Vine</hi>
hath no <hi>Flower,</hi> partly, that the most <hi>Volatile Spirit</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> might
all run into the <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>20. §. THE <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Flower,</hi> although it is often much more
complex, than that of the <hi>Leaf:</hi> yet there is no doubt, but that the
<hi>Measure</hi> hereof may be defined in some way, answerable to that exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisied
in the foregoing <hi>Part.</hi> The difference is only this, That
whereas the <hi>Green Leaves,</hi> and the Plain <hi>Leaves</hi> also of the <hi>Flower,</hi> are
all measured by the <hi>parts</hi> of several <hi>Circles:</hi> those <hi>Flowers</hi> which
are <hi>Bellyed,</hi> and those <hi>Leaves</hi> of the <hi>Flower</hi> which are not <hi>Plain,</hi>
but <hi>Convex,</hi> are all measured by the <hi>parts</hi> of several <hi>Spheres.</hi> And as
the <hi>Diametres</hi> of those <hi>Circles,</hi> bear a certain proportion to the midle
<hi>Stemm</hi> of the <hi>Leaf;</hi> so the <hi>Axes</hi> of these <hi>Spheres,</hi> to an imaginary
one in the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Flower.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>21. §. NOW the reason why the <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Flower</hi> is more
<hi>multiplex,</hi> than that of the <hi>Leaf;</hi> may be, <hi>partly,</hi> because it is under
the Command and Government of those <hi>Salts,</hi> which are here more
<hi>refined</hi> and <hi>depurate,</hi> than in the <hi>Leaf;</hi> and so more free to lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of any kind of <hi>Figure,</hi> for which, of their own <hi>Nature,</hi> they are
adapted. <hi>Partly,</hi> for that as the <hi>Nitrous</hi> and <hi>Alkaline Salts</hi> are chiefly
regnant in the <hi>Leaf;</hi> so in the <hi>Flower,</hi> in which the <hi>Parenchymous Part</hi>
hath a greater<note n="a" place="margin">§. 17.</note> proportion than in the <hi>Leaf;</hi> it is most reasonable,
to assign the <hi>Predominion</hi> to the <hi>Acid</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Idea, §. 52.</note> the <hi>Particles</hi> whereof, both as
they are less, and also poynted at both ends,<note n="c" place="margin">P. 1. Ch. 6. §. 13.</note> seem to be more easily
applicable one to another for the making of any Sort of <hi>Line</hi> or <hi>Figure.</hi>

of Two general <hi>Kinds,</hi> every where Various and

of them in the <hi>First Book.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ch. 5.</note> I shall here add some
further <hi>Remarques.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. And first, of that Sort of <hi>Attire,</hi> which
may be called <hi>Seminiform;</hi> being usually, as it
were, a little <hi>Sheaf</hi> of <hi>Seed-like Particles;</hi> standing on so many <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicills,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. Of their <hi>Colour</hi> it is observable, That for the most part, they
are <hi>White</hi> or <hi>Yellow;</hi> sometimes <hi>Blew;</hi> but never <hi>Red,</hi> let the <hi>Flower</hi>
or <hi>Foliature</hi> be of what <hi>Colour</hi> it will. Neither doth their <hi>Colour</hi> all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
follow that of the <hi>Foliature,</hi> although that be not <hi>Red.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it appears, how very Curious and Critical <hi>Nature</hi> is, in the <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>Juyces</hi> in <hi>Plants:</hi> that such small <hi>Parts</hi> as these of the <hi>Attire,</hi>
and so near the <hi>Leaves</hi> of the <hi>Flower,</hi> should yet receive a different
<hi>Tincture.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:100350:112"/>
4. §. These <hi>Parts</hi> differ also in their <hi>Position;</hi> standing sometimes
double upon each <hi>Pedicil,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 55.</note> as in <hi>Toad-flax, Snapdragon,</hi> and some others;
but usually single, as in <hi>Blattaria, Clematis Austriaca,</hi> &amp;c. Sometimes
fastned to their <hi>Pedicils</hi> at their middle, stooping down after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Poppy</hi> and other hanging <hi>Flowers;</hi> as in <hi>Spanish-Broom, Hysop,
Scabeous, Behen,</hi> &amp;c. Sometimes they stand erected, as in <hi>Clematis
Austriaca, Ladyes-Looking-Glass, Rape-Crowfoot,</hi> &amp;c. Those of <hi>Coded
Arsmart</hi> have no <hi>Pedicils,</hi> but stand upon a large <hi>Base.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. Of the <hi>Pedicils</hi> themselves, it is to be noted, That they are
rarely fastned to the <hi>Top</hi> of the <hi>Repository</hi> or <hi>Case</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> but
round about the <hi>Bottom. Partly,</hi> That hereby they may the better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept
and separate the <hi>Incongruous Parts</hi> of the <hi>Sap</hi> from the <hi>Seed.</hi>
Yet in the <hi>Coded Arsmart</hi> they stand at the <hi>Top.</hi> Which is not the only
thing peculiar in that <hi>Plant;</hi> it being the property thereof, to ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
its <hi>Seed,</hi> upon the least touch. Which property seemeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
<hi>partly,</hi> upon the <hi>Position</hi> of the said <hi>Pedicils,</hi> as shall be shewed
in speaking of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. These <hi>Seed-like Parts</hi> are also of different <hi>Number.</hi> In <hi>Great
Celandine, Rose, Rape-Crowfoot,</hi> numerous; in <hi>Great Plantaine,</hi> and
some other <hi>Herbs,</hi> much more conspicous than the <hi>Foliature</hi> it self. In
<hi>Germander-Chickweed,</hi> they are always <hi>Two,</hi> and no more. Sometimes
they follow the number of the <hi>Leaves,</hi> especially in the number 5; as
in <hi>Blattaria, Black Henbean,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>Stichwort</hi> and <hi>Lychnis Sylvestris,</hi>
they are 10, just double to the number of the <hi>Leaves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. They differ also in their <hi>Bigness,</hi> being in some smaller <hi>Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
large; as in <hi>Borage, Ladys-Looking-Glass,</hi> and others: and in some
larger <hi>Flowers,</hi> less; as in the <hi>Rose.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. But especially in their <hi>Shape,</hi> which is always very Elegant,
and with much Variety. In <hi>Borage,</hi> like the point of a <hi>Spear.</hi> In <hi>Blat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria,</hi>
like a <hi>Horse-shooe.</hi> In <hi>Clematis Austriaca,</hi> like the <hi>Spatula,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<hi>Apothecaries</hi> make their <hi>Mixtures.</hi> In <hi>Mallow,</hi> like a <hi>Head-Roll.</hi>
In <hi>Hysop,</hi> they have one <hi>Cleft</hi> before; in <hi>Blattaria,</hi> one round about;
in <hi>Water Bettony,</hi> one at the <hi>Top;</hi> in <hi>Scabious,</hi> they have a double <hi>Cleft,</hi>
one on each side;<note place="margin">Tab. 56.</note> and so in St. <hi>Johns Wort, Hyoscyamus,</hi> and others;
before they open, in the <hi>Shape</hi> of a double <hi>Purse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. These <hi>Parts,</hi> are all hollow; each being the <hi>Theca</hi> or <hi>Case</hi>
of a great many extream small <hi>Particles,</hi> either <hi>Globular,</hi> or otherwise
<hi>Convex;</hi> but always regularly <hi>figur'd.</hi> They are all crowded together,
and fastned in close <hi>Ranks,</hi> without any <hi>Pedicils,</hi> to the Insides of the
<hi>Theca,</hi> like other lesser <hi>Seeds</hi> within a greater; or after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as in <hi>Hyoscyamus</hi> and some other <hi>Plants,</hi> the true <hi>Seeds</hi> themselves
grow all round about close to the <hi>Bed</hi> of the <hi>Case;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 55, 56.</note> as in <hi>Clary,</hi> and
the <hi>Figures</hi> now referred to, may be seen. And when they are ripe, the
<hi>Case</hi> also opens and admits them to the <hi>Aer,</hi> as the <hi>Seed-Case</hi> doth the
<hi>Seed.</hi> The whole <hi>Attire,</hi> together with the <hi>Foliature</hi> and <hi>Seed-Case,</hi>
See in one Example,<note place="margin">Tab. 57.</note> amongst the <hi>Figures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. §. The <hi>Colour</hi> of these small <hi>Particles</hi> conteined in the <hi>Theca,</hi>
is also different. But as That is usually <hi>White</hi> or <hi>Yellow,</hi> so are These:
sometimes <hi>Blewish;</hi> but never <hi>Red.</hi> And sometimes not of the same
<hi>Colour</hi> with that of the <hi>Theca.</hi> Which further shews how scrupulous
<hi>Nature,</hi> is, in differencing the <hi>Tinctures</hi> of the several <hi>Parts.</hi>
                     </p>

11. §. They are also of different <hi>Bigness</hi> and <hi>Figure.</hi> Those in
<hi>Snap-dragon,</hi> are of the smallest <hi>Size</hi> I have seen;<note place="margin">Tab. 58.</note> being no bigger
through a good <hi>Microscope,</hi> than the least <hi>Cheese-Mite</hi> to the naked
Eye. In <hi>Plantain,</hi> also through a <hi>Glass,</hi> like a <hi>Scurvy-grass-seed.</hi> In
<hi>Bears-foot,</hi> like a <hi>Mustard-seed.</hi> In <hi>Carnation,</hi> like a <hi>Turnep-Seed.</hi> In
<hi>Bindweed,</hi> like a <hi>Peper-Corn.</hi> In all these of a <hi>Globular Figure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. In <hi>Devils-bit,</hi> they are also <hi>Round,</hi> but depressed, like the <hi>Seed</hi>
of <hi>Goos-grass,</hi> or a <hi>Holland Cheese.</hi> In the <hi>Bean</hi> and all sorts of <hi>Puls,</hi>
and <hi>Trefoyls,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 58.</note> as also in <hi>Blew-bottle,</hi> &amp;c. they are <hi>Cylindrick.</hi> In <hi>Orange
Lilly, Oval,</hi> one 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of an Inch long, like an <hi>Ants-Egg.</hi> In <hi>Deadly-Night-shade,</hi>
also <hi>Oval,</hi> but smaller at both Ends. And those of <hi>Pancy, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick.</hi>
In all these and the former, they are <hi>Smooth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13. §. But in <hi>Mallow, Holyoak,</hi> and all of that kind, they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
round about with little <hi>Thornes;</hi> whereby each looks like the <hi>Seed-Ball</hi>
of <hi>Roman Nettle,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 58.</note> or like the <hi>Fruit</hi> of <hi>Thorn-Apple,</hi> or the <hi>Fish</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Piscis orbis minor,</hi> or the <hi>Murices,</hi> used antiently in <hi>Wars.</hi> They are
also very great, shewing, through a <hi>Glass,</hi> of the bigness of a large
<hi>White Pease;</hi> being 200 or 300 times biger than those in <hi>Snapdragon;</hi>
of which there are about a <hi>Thousand</hi> in each <hi>Theca,</hi> that is, in the space
of about 1000<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                        <hi>Cubical Part</hi> of an Inch.</p>
                     <p>15. §. In some <hi>Plants,</hi> as in <hi>Deadly Night-shade,</hi> where these <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ales</hi>
are <hi>White,</hi> they seem, by a very good <hi>Glass</hi> and advantagious <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
to be composed of <hi>Parenchymous</hi> and <hi>Lignous Fibres,</hi> stitched up
together, as in the other <hi>Parts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>15. §. In <hi>Colocynthis,</hi> (and with some <hi>Analogy</hi> in <hi>Wild Cucumer,</hi>
and I suppose all of that kind) the <hi>Attire</hi> is very peculiar, not consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of several little <hi>Thecae,</hi> upon so many <hi>Pedicils,</hi> as is described; but
is all one entire <hi>Part,</hi> like a thick <hi>Columna</hi> in the midst of the <hi>Flower;</hi>
having several little <hi>Ridges,</hi> and <hi>Furrows</hi> winding from the <hi>Top</hi> to the
<hi>Bottom</hi> round about. In the midle of each <hi>Ridge</hi> runs a <hi>Line,</hi> where
the <hi>Skin,</hi> after sometime, openeth into two <hi>Lips,</hi> presenting the <hi>Globu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Particles</hi> conteined in the hollow of every <hi>Ridge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. §. Where the <hi>Attire</hi> consists of several <hi>Seed-like Parts,</hi> as is
described; there, another <hi>Part</hi> distinct, like a little <hi>Columna</hi> or <hi>Pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi>
stands on the <hi>Top</hi> of the <hi>Uterus</hi> or true <hi>Seed-Case.</hi> Which is
also regularly and variously <hi>Figured.</hi> In <hi>Bindweed,</hi> it hath a round
<hi>Head,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 56, 57.</note> like that of a great <hi>Pin.</hi> In the <hi>Common Bell,</hi> St. <hi>Johns wort,</hi> it is
divided into <hi>Three Parts.</hi> In <hi>Gerarium,</hi> into <hi>Five;</hi> In <hi>Asarum,</hi> into
<hi>Six.</hi> Sometimes, the <hi>Head is Smooth,</hi> and sometimes beset with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N THIS <hi>Attire</hi> there is also much Elegant Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
according to the <hi>Description</hi> we have given
of it in the <hi>First Book.</hi> It always consists of
several <hi>Suits;</hi> Ten, Twenty, Fourty, a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
or more, according to the <hi>Bigness</hi> of the
<hi>Flower.</hi> And every <hi>Suit</hi> most commonly, of three
distinct <hi>Parts,</hi> all of a Regular, but Different <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</hi>
The utmost Part, is always like a little
<hi>Flower</hi> with Five <hi>Leaves</hi> and a <hi>Tubular Base,</hi> like that of <hi>Cowslip.</hi> So
that every <hi>Flower</hi> with the <hi>Florid Attire,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 59.</note> Embosomes, or is, a <hi>Posy</hi> of
perfect <hi>Flowers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. In some <hi>Flowers,</hi> every one of these <hi>Florets,</hi> is encompassed
with an <hi>Hedg</hi> of <hi>Hairs;</hi> and every <hi>Hair</hi> branched on both sides
almost like a <hi>Sprig</hi> of <hi>Fir;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 59.</note> as in <hi>Aster Atticus, Golden-Rod,</hi> and
others.</p>
                     <p>3. §. The <hi>Base</hi> of the <hi>Floret</hi> is usually <hi>Cylindrick,</hi> but sometimes
Square, as in <hi>French Marigold.</hi> And the <hi>Leaves</hi> hereof which, for
the most part,<note place="margin">Tab. 60.</note> are Smooth on the Inside, in the same <hi>Flower</hi> are all
over <hi>Hairy.</hi> And the Edges of these little <hi>Flowers,</hi> are frequently
<hi>Ridged,</hi> or as it were, <hi>He m'd,</hi> like the Edge of a <hi>Band.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. The midlemost of the Three <hi>Parts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">B. 1. Ch. 5.</note> which I call the <hi>Sheath,</hi>
is usually fastened towards the <hi>Top,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 60, 61, 62.</note> or else at the <hi>Bottom</hi> of the <hi>Floret.</hi>
This is rather indented, than parted into <hi>Leaves.</hi> The <hi>Surface</hi> seldom
Plain or Even, but wrought with Five <hi>Ridges,</hi> and as many <hi>Gutters</hi>
running almost Parallel from the <hi>Top</hi> to the <hi>Bottom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. The <hi>Inmost Part,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">B. 1. Ch. 5.</note> which I call the <hi>Blade,</hi> runs through the
hollow of the Two Former, and so is fastned, with the <hi>Floret,</hi> to the
convex of the <hi>Seed-Case.</hi> The <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Sides</hi> of this <hi>Part,</hi> is always
beset round about with <hi>Globulets,</hi> commonly through a <hi>Glass,</hi> as big
as a <hi>Turnep-seed,</hi> or a great <hi>Pins-Head.</hi> In some <hi>Plants</hi> growing close
to the <hi>Blade,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 60, 61, 62.</note> as in the common <hi>Marigold;</hi> in the <hi>French,</hi> and others,
upon <hi>Pedicils</hi> or little slender <hi>Stalks.</hi> These, as the <hi>Blade</hi> springeth up
from within the <hi>Sheath,</hi> are still rubed off, and so stand like a <hi>Powder</hi>
on them both. And sometimes, as in <hi>Cichory,</hi> they seem to grow on
the Inside the <hi>Sheath,</hi> if it be split with a small <hi>Pin:</hi> as also in <hi>Knap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed,</hi>
in which they are numerous. Yet in the <hi>Seed-like Attire,</hi> always
more numerous, than in the <hi>Florid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. The <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Blade</hi> is always divided into <hi>Two,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 58, &amp;c.</note> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
into <hi>Three Parts,</hi> as in <hi>Cichory;</hi> which, by degrees, curl outward,
after the manner of <hi>Scorpion-Grass.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. The <hi>Description</hi> now given, agrees principally to the <hi>Corym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biferous
Kind,</hi> as <hi>Tansy, Chamemile,</hi> and the like. But in <hi>Scorgonera,</hi> as
also <hi>Cichory, Hawk-Weed, Mousear</hi> and all the <hi>Intybous</hi> Kind, with many
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100350:113"/>
more, the <hi>Attire</hi> is not separate from the <hi>Foliature,</hi> so as to stand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that in one entire <hi>Posy;</hi> but every <hi>Leaf</hi> of the <hi>Flower</hi> hath its own
<hi>Attire</hi> apart. For the sake of which, the <hi>Basis</hi> of every <hi>Leaf</hi> is formd
into a little <hi>Tube</hi> or <hi>Pipe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 62.</note> whereby it embosomes its own <hi>Attire</hi> within
it self. Consisting commonly of <hi>Two Parts,</hi> a <hi>Sheath</hi> and a <hi>Blade:</hi> the
<hi>Leaf</hi> it self answering to the <hi>Floret</hi> in other <hi>Flowers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. In some <hi>Plants,</hi> besides the <hi>Attire</hi> or <hi>Posy</hi> in the midle of
the <hi>Flower;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 61.</note> the <hi>Leaves</hi> also have each their own to themselves, as in
<hi>Marigold:</hi> yet this, as I take it, consisting only of one single <hi>Part,</hi> which
answers to the <hi>Blade;</hi> the <hi>Leaf</hi> it self being as the <hi>Sheath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. In many <hi>Plants,</hi> this <hi>Florid Attire</hi> is very large; so that not
only the <hi>Suits,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 61.</note> but also the several <hi>Parts</hi> whereof every <hi>Suit</hi> consists,
being throughly ripe and well blown open, are all visible to the bare
Eye, as in <hi>Knapweed,</hi> and all the <hi>Thistle Kind.</hi> This <hi>Attire</hi> is all the
<hi>Flower,</hi> that this sort of <hi>Plants</hi> have; being, though <hi>Empal'd,</hi> yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any <hi>Foliature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. §. And sometimes, there is little or no <hi>Flower</hi> besides this <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,</hi>
although extream small, as in <hi>Golden Rod, Wormwood</hi> and others.
Where it may be noted, That the <hi>Medicine</hi> called <hi>Wormseed</hi> or <hi>Semen
Santonici,</hi> is no Sort of <hi>Seed,</hi> but the <hi>Buds</hi> of small <hi>Flowers,</hi> or of the
<hi>Florid Attire</hi> of that <hi>Plant.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F the <hi>Secundary Use</hi> hereof, I have spoken in the
<hi>First Book;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ch. 5.</note> and particularly, of the <hi>Globulets</hi> or
small <hi>Particles</hi> within the <hi>Thecae</hi> of the <hi>Seed-like At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,</hi>
and upon the <hi>Blades</hi> of the <hi>Florid,</hi> I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectur'd,
That they are that <hi>Body</hi> which <hi>Bees</hi> gather
and carry upon their <hi>Thighs,</hi> and is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
their <hi>Bread.</hi> For the <hi>Wax</hi> they carry in little
<hi>Flakes</hi> in their <hi>Chaps:</hi> but the <hi>Bread</hi> is a Kind of <hi>Powder;</hi> yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
moist, as are the said little <hi>Particles</hi> of the <hi>Attire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. But the Primary and chief <hi>Use</hi> of the <hi>Attire</hi> is such, as hath
respect to the <hi>Plant</hi> it self; and so appears to be very great and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.
Because, even those <hi>Plants</hi> which have no <hi>Flower</hi> or <hi>Foliature,</hi>
are yet some way or other <hi>Attir'd;</hi> either with the <hi>Seminiform,</hi> or the
<hi>Florid Attire.</hi> So that it seems to perform its service to the <hi>Seed,</hi> as
the <hi>Foliature,</hi> to the <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. In discourse hereof with our Learned <hi>Savilian</hi> Professor Sir
<hi>Thomas Millington,</hi> he told me, he conceived, That the <hi>Attire</hi> doth
serve, as the <hi>Male,</hi> for the <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. I immediately reply'd, That I was of the same Opinion;
and gave him some reasons for it, and answered some <hi>Objections,</hi> which
might oppose them. But withall, in regard every <hi>Plant</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
or <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female,</hi> that I was also of Opinion, That it serveth for
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100350:114"/>
the <hi>Separation</hi> of some <hi>Parts,</hi> as well as the <hi>Affusion</hi> of others. The sum
therefore of my Thoughts concerning this <hi>Matter,</hi> is as follows.</p>
                     <p>5. §. And First, it seems, That the <hi>Attire</hi> serves to discharge some
redundant <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Sap,</hi> as a <hi>Work</hi> preparatory to the <hi>Generation</hi> of
the <hi>Seed.</hi> In particular, that as the <hi>Foliature</hi> serveth to carry off the <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
Saline Sulphur:</hi> So the <hi>Attire,</hi> to minorate and adjust the <hi>Aereal;</hi> to
the end, the <hi>Seed</hi> may become the more <hi>Oyly,</hi> and its <hi>Principles,</hi> the
better fixed. And therefore the <hi>Foliature</hi> generally hath a much
stronger <hi>Odour,</hi> than the <hi>Attire:</hi> because the <hi>Saline Sulphur</hi> is stronger,
than an <hi>Aerial,</hi> which is too subtile to affect the Sense. Hence also it is,
that the <hi>Colour</hi> of the <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Attire,</hi> is usually <hi>White,</hi> or <hi>Yellow,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Red:</hi> the former, depending upon a greater participation of <hi>Aer;</hi>
the latter, of <hi>Sulphur.</hi> I add further, That the most <hi>Volatile</hi> and <hi>Aeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Sulphur;</hi> being by means of these <hi>Parts</hi> much discharged; it may
hereby come to pass, not only that the <hi>Seed</hi> is more <hi>Oylie,</hi> and its <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
more fixed; but also, that the <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Parenchyma</hi> thereof, is so
compact and close: For although it consists of <hi>Bladders,</hi> yet such, as
are Twenty times smaller than in any other <hi>Part</hi> of a <hi>Plant</hi> of the like
bigness. Whereas, were the <hi>Aer</hi> copiously mixed with the <hi>Sap</hi> here,
as in the <hi>Pith, Fruit,</hi> and other <hi>Parenchymous Parts;</hi> it would give so
quick a <hi>Ferment</hi> to the <hi>Sap,</hi> as to dilate and amplify the <hi>Bladders</hi> of
the <hi>Seed,</hi> beyond its present compact and durable <hi>Texture;</hi> and so expose
it, either to a precipitant <hi>Growth,</hi> or sudden <hi>Rot.</hi> Wherefore, as
the <hi>Seed-Case</hi> is the <hi>Womb;</hi> so the <hi>Attire</hi> (which always stands upon
or round about it) and those <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Sap</hi> herinto discharged;
are, as it were, the <hi>Menses</hi> or <hi>Flowers,</hi> by which the <hi>Sap</hi> in the <hi>Womb,</hi>
is duly qualified, for the approaching <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. And as the young and early <hi>Attire</hi> before it opens, answers
to the <hi>Menses</hi> in the <hi>Femal:</hi> so is it probable, that afterward when it
opens or cracks, it performs the <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Male.</hi> This is hinted from
the <hi>Shape</hi> of the <hi>Parts.</hi> For in the <hi>Florid Attire,</hi> the <hi>Blade</hi> doth not
unaptly resemble a small <hi>Penis,</hi> with the <hi>Sheath</hi> upon it, as its <hi>Praeputi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi>
And in the <hi>Seed-like Attire,</hi> the several <hi>Thecae,</hi> are like so many
little <hi>Testicles.</hi> And the <hi>Globulets</hi> and other small <hi>Particles</hi> upon the
<hi>Blade</hi> or <hi>Penis,</hi> and in the <hi>Thecae,</hi> are as the <hi>Vegetable Sperme.</hi> Which,
so soon as the <hi>Penis</hi> is exerted, or the <hi>Testicles</hi> come to break, falls
down upon the <hi>Seed-Case</hi> or <hi>Womb,</hi> and so Touches it with a <hi>Proli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick</hi>
Virtue.</p>
                     <p>7. §. <hi>Consentaneous</hi> hereto it is also observable, That those <hi>Herbs</hi>
generally have the <hi>Seed-like Attire,</hi> which either produce a greater Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of <hi>Seed,</hi> or a <hi>Perennial Root:</hi> and that there is no <hi>Tree,</hi> with the
<hi>Florid Attire.</hi> As if the other, because it contains a far greater Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the abovesaid <hi>Particles,</hi> that is, of <hi>Sperm;</hi> 'tis able to beget
a more <hi>Numerous, Vivaceous,</hi> or <hi>Gigantick Birth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. That the same <hi>Plant</hi> is both <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female,</hi> may the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be believed, in that <hi>Snails,</hi> and some other <hi>Animals,</hi> are such.
And the <hi>Parts</hi> which imitate the <hi>Menses,</hi> and the <hi>Sperm,</hi> are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
the same: the former, being the External <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Attire,</hi> and
the <hi>Sap,</hi> which feeds them; the latter, the small <hi>Particles</hi> or moyst
<hi>Powder</hi> which the External inclose.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="173" facs="tcp:100350:114"/>
9. §. And that these <hi>Particles,</hi> only by falling on the <hi>Uterus,</hi>
should communicate to it or to the <hi>Sap</hi> therein, a <hi>Prolifick Virtue;</hi> it
may seem the more credible, from the manner wherein <hi>Coition</hi> is made
by some <hi>Animals;</hi> as by many <hi>Birds,</hi> where there is no <hi>Intromission,</hi>
but only an <hi>Adosculation</hi> of <hi>Parts:</hi> And so in many <hi>Fishes.</hi> Neither
in others, doth the <hi>Penis</hi> ever enter any further than the <hi>Neck</hi> of the
<hi>Womb.</hi> Nor doth perhaps the <hi>Semen</hi> it self: or if it doth, it can by no
means be thought, bodily or as to its gross <hi>Substance,</hi> to enter the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,</hi>
in which every <hi>Conception,</hi> or the <hi>Liquor</hi> intended for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any <hi>Coitiou,</hi> is involved; but only some subtle and <hi>vivifick Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
to which the visible <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Semen,</hi> is but a <hi>Vehicle.</hi> And the
like <hi>Effluvia</hi> may be very easily transfused from the above said <hi>Particles</hi>
into the <hi>Seed-Case</hi> or <hi>Womb</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. §. If any one shall require the Similitude to hold in every
Thing; he would not have a <hi>Plant</hi> to resemble, but to be, an <hi>Animal.</hi>

is a Providence in Nature, whereof, I do a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
wonder, that no one, amongst so many obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of <hi>Plants,</hi> hath ever yet taken any notice. It is
therefore to be remarked, That all <hi>Flowers</hi> are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
or perfectly finished, in all their <hi>Parts,</hi> long
before they appear in sight; usually Three or Four
Months, and sometimes half a year, or more. And that in all <hi>Peren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Plants,</hi> those <hi>Flowers</hi> which appear and are called the <hi>Flowers</hi> of
any one year; are not formed in that year; but were actually in
<hi>Being,</hi> and entirely formed in all <hi>Parts,</hi> the year before; as in many
<hi>Herbs,</hi> and in all <hi>Shrubs</hi> and <hi>Trees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. This will best be seen by some Instances. So the <hi>Flower</hi> of
<hi>Mezereon,</hi> which opens in <hi>January,</hi> is entirely formed about the midle
of <hi>August</hi> in the year foregoing. At which time, the <hi>Green Leaves</hi> of
the <hi>Bud</hi> being cautiously removed,<note place="margin">Tab. 63.</note> the <hi>Leaves</hi> of the <hi>Flower,</hi> and the
<hi>Thecae Seminiformes</hi> or <hi>Seed-like Attire,</hi> encompassing the <hi>Seed-Case,</hi>
through an indifferent <hi>Glass,</hi> are all distinctly visible.</p>
                     <p>3. §. The like may be seen in <hi>Sirynga,</hi> and other <hi>Shrubs,</hi> and in
<hi>Trees.</hi> In as many of which, as are <hi>Frugiferous,</hi> the <hi>Fruit</hi> also, which
answers to the <hi>Seed-Case</hi> in other <hi>Plants,</hi> is about the same time entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
formed.</p>
                     <p>4. §. And so in <hi>Herbs;</hi> as the <hi>Flower</hi> of <hi>Asarum,</hi> which appeareth
in <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> is entirely formed in <hi>August</hi> or <hi>July</hi> of the foregoing
year. For there are here,<note place="margin">Tab. 64.</note> as well as in <hi>Trees,</hi> Two Sorts of <hi>Buds;</hi> some
which are composed only of <hi>Green Leaves;</hi> and some which also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein
a <hi>Flower</hi> and the <hi>Seed-Case.</hi> So in <hi>Bears-foot,</hi> by some called the
<hi>January Rose,</hi> the <hi>Flower-Buds,</hi> which open in <hi>January</hi> are all formed
in or before the Month of <hi>August</hi> in the year preceding.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="tcp:100350:115"/>
5. §. The same may also be seen about the end of <hi>August</hi> or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>September</hi> in a <hi>Tulip-Root.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 63.</note> In which, the Two Inmost <hi>Shells</hi>
dryer than the rest, stand hollow, with the little young <hi>Flower</hi> (which
appears in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April</hi> following) inclosed now in their <hi>Centre.</hi> Being
thus kept <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>dry,</hi> lest it should either perish, or be precipitated
upon the <hi>Winter,</hi> by sprouting too soon.</p>
                     <p>6. §. From hence it is plain, That although the <hi>Flower</hi> appears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Seed;</hi> yet if the comparison be made betwixt the <hi>Flower</hi> and
<hi>Seed</hi> of the same year; the <hi>Seed</hi> is first formed, and afterward the
<hi>Flower.</hi> That is, the <hi>Seed,</hi> for which Nature chooses the First-born
<hi>Sap,</hi> is formed in the fore part of the year: which work being
finished, out of the less <hi>foecund part</hi> of the <hi>Sap,</hi> the <hi>Flowers</hi> intended
for the <hi>Sire</hi> and <hi>Matrix</hi> of the next years <hi>Seed;</hi> is afterwards produced.</p>
                     <p>7. §. THE true <hi>Time</hi> of the <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Flower</hi> being
know'n, it may also be an Inducement to make Tryal, for the bringing
of many <hi>Flowers</hi> to grow fairly in <hi>Winter,</hi> which are used to grow, that
is, to appear, only in the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Summer: sc.</hi> by keeping the <hi>Plants</hi>
warm, and thereby enticing the young lurking <hi>Flowers</hi> to come abroad.</p>

                        <head>The Appendix. Being a Method proposed, for the ready finding, by the
Leaf and Flower, to what Sort any Plant belongeth.</head>
                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LTHOUGH many have bestowed extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Care and Industry upon the searching out, and
Description of <hi>Plants;</hi> and for the reducing of
them to their several <hi>Tribes:</hi> yet I will take leave,
here to propose a short <hi>Method</hi> whereby Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
seeing a <hi>Plant</hi> they know not, may be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to what Sort it belongs, and so be directed
where to find it described and discoursed of. For, except they have
a Master to conduct them, which few have; they must needs, by seeking
at random, lose a great deal of time, which by a regular Enquiry might
be saved. Besides, that what is learned by their own Observation,
will abide much longer on their mind, than what they are only Poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to, by another.</p>
                        <p>2. §. Now the most <hi>Philosophick</hi> way of distinguishing or sorting
of <hi>Plants,</hi> were by the <hi>Characteristick Properties</hi> in all <hi>Parts,</hi> both <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
Constituents,</hi> and <hi>Contents.</hi> But of the <hi>Compounded,</hi> the <hi>Seeds,</hi>
and some other <hi>Parts,</hi> are oftentimes very <hi>minute:</hi> and the <hi>Roots</hi> always
lie hid. As also the <hi>Constituent Parts,</hi> every where, without cuting and
the use of <hi>Glasses.</hi> Nor can the <hi>Contents</hi> be accurately observed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
So that for the <hi>Use</hi> here intended, those <hi>Properties</hi> are the fitest
to be insisted upon, which are the most <hi>Conspicuous,</hi> and in those <hi>Parts,</hi>
where the Learner may the most readily and without any difficulty
take notice of them; as in the <hi>Flower</hi> and <hi>Leaf.</hi> The <hi>Flower</hi> hath
Varieties enough of it self. But in regard it is often wanting, when the
<hi>Green Leaf</hi> is not; it is therefore convenient, that he be assisted
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100350:115"/>
by both, and that the Varieties of both be distinctly reduced unto <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi>
Which may be done, after the following, or some other like
manner.</p>
                        <p>3. §. And First for the <hi>Leaves.</hi> The most obvious <hi>Varieties</hi> of
which, are in their <hi>Position, Size</hi> or <hi>Shape.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. §. <hi>Leaves</hi> are fastned with, or without a <hi>Stalk.</hi> Without,
only close to the <hi>Branch,</hi> as in <hi>Southistle;</hi> or surrounding it, as in
<hi>Thorow-Wax.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. §. Both these ways, they stand either singly, that is, but one at
the same height; or more together.</p>
                        <p>6. §. More together, in Even or Odd Numbers. In Even Numbers,
commonly Two and Two, as in <hi>Sage, Polium;</hi> Sometimes Four, as
in <hi>Cross-wort, Madder, Herb True-Love, Pomum Majae;</hi> or more, as,
I think, in <hi>Woodrofe,</hi> &amp;c. In Odd Numbers, Three, as in all <hi>Trefoyls,
Strawberries;</hi> Five, in <hi>Pentaphil, Castanea Equina;</hi> Seven, in <hi>Tormentil.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. §. The <hi>Sizes</hi> of <hi>Leaves</hi> are innumerable. It is therefore neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to reduce them to a Standard. And so, they may be reckoned,
Three; <hi>Small, Mean</hi> and <hi>Great:</hi> with respect to the <hi>Length</hi> of the
<hi>Leaf,</hi> the <hi>Breadth,</hi> or both. From one Inch and under, all <hi>Leaves</hi> may
be accounted <hi>Small;</hi> from one Inch and over, to five Inches, <hi>Mean:</hi>
from five and over, <hi>Great.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>8. §. The <hi>Shapes</hi> of <hi>Leaves</hi> are also numberless. But the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
distinctions which they admit of, are such as these;</p>
                        <p>9. §. <hi>Leaves</hi> are <hi>Membraneous,</hi> as the greater part; <hi>Squameous,</hi> as
<hi>Abies,</hi> or <hi>Filamentous.</hi> Which are <hi>solid,</hi> as in <hi>Fenil, Meum; Buphthal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,
Chamemile, Groundpine;</hi> or <hi>hollow,</hi> as in <hi>Onion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>10. §. <hi>Membraneous,</hi> have all their main <hi>Fibres</hi> produced either from
the <hi>Stalk,</hi> as in <hi>Holyoak;</hi> or from the midle <hi>Stem</hi> of the <hi>Leaf,</hi> as in
most. From the middle <hi>Stem,</hi> reciprocally, as in <hi>Scabious,</hi> or oppositely,
that is, one over against another, as in <hi>Rose:</hi> and both ways, at <hi>Acute
Angles,</hi> as in most; or <hi>Right,</hi> as in <hi>Dandelion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>11. §. Again, they are different with respect to the <hi>Top,</hi> the <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,</hi>
and the <hi>Sides.</hi> The <hi>Top</hi> is <hi>Thorny,</hi> as in <hi>Furz;</hi> or <hi>Unarmed. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed,</hi>
either <hi>Produced,</hi> that is, <hi>Poynted,</hi> or at least, <hi>Roundish,</hi> as in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium,
Ironwort;</hi> or else <hi>Reduced,</hi> as in <hi>Woodsorrel.</hi> And so the <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,</hi>
is either <hi>Reduced</hi> towards the <hi>Top,</hi> as in <hi>Ground-Ivy;</hi> or <hi>Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi>
upon the <hi>Stalk,</hi> as in <hi>Poplar, Bay,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>12. §. The <hi>Sides</hi> or <hi>Edges</hi> of the <hi>Leaf,</hi> are either of one and the
same <hi>Measure,</hi> as commonly; or of divers, as in <hi>Doronicum.</hi> Both
ways they are Even, as in <hi>Syringa, Mous-ear;</hi> or Uneven. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even,
are <hi>Prickly,</hi> as <hi>Holly, Eryngium, Thistle;</hi> or Unarmed. Unar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
are Insected, or Resected. Insected deeply, that is, Lobed, as
<hi>Golden Liverwort, Clematis Peregrina;</hi> or with shallow <hi>Insections,</hi> as
in most. And so, Indented, or Scallopped: the former, when the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi>
is made with Straight <hi>Lines,</hi> as in <hi>Dandelion;</hi> the latter, with Crooked,
as in <hi>Thalictrum.</hi> Resected, that is, both Lobed, and Insected, or when
upon the greater <hi>Insections,</hi> there are other lesser ones, as in <hi>Wild-Clary,
Lovage, Masterwort.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>13. §. THE most Conspicuous Varieties of <hi>Flowers,</hi> are in their
<hi>Position, Size, Shape,</hi> and <hi>Colour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>14. §. Most are fastned with <hi>Stalks;</hi> but many without. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
they are placed round about the <hi>Branch,</hi> that is, Coronated, as
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100350:116"/>
in <hi>Pulegium;</hi> and sometimes, all on one side; either in <hi>Ranks</hi> only, as
in <hi>Bawm;</hi> or in <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>File,</hi> as in <hi>Foxglove.</hi> In <hi>Saxifraga Aurea,</hi>
they grow on the <hi>Leaf.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>15. §. Again, they either stand Singly, as in <hi>Corn Marigold;</hi> or
Clustur'd. And so, either all upon one <hi>Branch,</hi> or on several little <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mificated
Sprigs.</hi> On one <hi>Branch,</hi> prolonged like a Tail, as in <hi>Blatta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi>
or Contracted. And so, either without <hi>Stalks,</hi> that is, <hi>Capita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
as in <hi>Scabious;</hi> or with <hi>Stalks,</hi> that is, <hi>Umbellated,</hi> as <hi>Fenil,</hi> &amp;c.
On several <hi>Sprigs,</hi> as in <hi>Tanacetum, Yarrow.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>16. §. The <hi>Sizes</hi> of <hi>Flowers,</hi> as of the <hi>Leaves,</hi> may be reduced to
Three. From ½ an Inch and under, in <hi>Diameter</hi> or <hi>Length,</hi> may be
accounted <hi>Small.</hi> From ½ an Inch and over to an Inch and ½ may go
for <hi>Mean.</hi> And from an Inch and ½ and over, <hi>Great.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>17. In respect of the <hi>Shape, Flowers</hi> are <hi>Open</hi> or <hi>Belly'd, Open</hi> have
both <hi>Leaves</hi> and <hi>Attire,</hi> as most; or else are all <hi>Attire,</hi> as of <hi>Burdock,
Beta Cretica.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>18. §. The <hi>Open,</hi> consist of a Certain Number of <hi>Leaves, One,
Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Thirteen,</hi> or
<hi>One</hi> and <hi>Twenty.</hi> Uncertain, commonly called <hi>Double.</hi> Those of a
Certain <hi>Number,</hi> either <hi>Uniform,</hi> that is, all of a certain <hi>Size</hi> and
<hi>Shape,</hi> as usually; or <hi>Biform,</hi> or <hi>Triform,</hi> as in <hi>Iris, Blattaria.</hi> And
these again, Even <hi>Edged</hi> or <hi>Notched;</hi> with <hi>Three Poynts,</hi> as in <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gold;</hi>
or <hi>Five,</hi> in <hi>Cichory.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>19. §. The <hi>Belly'd,</hi> are either so in whole; or in Part, that is,
with the <hi>Top</hi> divided into <hi>Leaves,</hi> and the <hi>Bottom, Hollow:</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
are also Even <hi>Edged,</hi> as in <hi>Convolvulus;</hi> or <hi>Notched,</hi> as in <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelium.</hi>
The latter have their <hi>Leaves</hi> distinguished as before. Their
<hi>Bottom</hi> or <hi>Base,</hi> either fastned to the <hi>Seed-Case,</hi> as in <hi>Snap-dragon;</hi> or
standing below it. And so, either Straight, as I think in <hi>Toad-flax;</hi>
or Crooked, as in <hi>Violet, Lark-heel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>20. §. In all these, the <hi>Attire</hi> is either <hi>Seminiform,</hi> or <hi>Florid.</hi> And
both, <hi>Clustur'd,</hi> or <hi>Divided;</hi> as in <hi>Mallow, St. Johns wort; Starwort,
Hawkweed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>21. §. The <hi>Colours</hi> of the <hi>Flower,</hi> are <hi>White,</hi> as in <hi>Water-Crowfoot;
Red,</hi> as <hi>Lychnis; Blew,</hi> as <hi>Borage; Purple,</hi> as <hi>Stock-July-Flower; Black,</hi>
as in some <hi>Anemones; Yellow,</hi> in <hi>Wall-Flower; Tawny,</hi> in <hi>Colus Jovis;
Green,</hi> in <hi>Laureola.</hi> Which are either <hi>Single,</hi> or <hi>Mixed: Two</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as in <hi>Butyr-Bur, White</hi> and <hi>Red;</hi> in <hi>White Hellibore, White</hi> and
<hi>Green;</hi> in <hi>Monks Rubarb, Red</hi> and <hi>Green;</hi> &amp;c. Or <hi>Three</hi> together, as
in <hi>Pancy, Yellow, Blew,</hi> and <hi>Black,</hi> i. e. <hi>atro-purpurcus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>22. §. How far these, and some other like <hi>Distinctions,</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to <hi>Tables,</hi> would serve for the finding out of any Sort of <hi>Plant,</hi>
may be conceived, if we consider, how great a Variety, a few <hi>Bells,</hi> in
the ringing of Changes, will produce. And the search will be easy, and
successfull, if in every foregoing <hi>Table,</hi> reference be made to those that
follow; and in the <hi>Tables</hi> conteining the last <hi>Divisions,</hi> the Names of
the <hi>Plants</hi> therein poynted out, be expressed.</p>

together with the <hi>Figures</hi> thereto belonging, were
presented to this <hi>Honourable Society,</hi> the last year.
I shall conclude this Subject with <hi>Fruits</hi> and
<hi>Seeds;</hi> beginning with <hi>Fruits,</hi> which will take
up the present Discourse.</p>
                     <p>2. §. And First, I shall describe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
<hi>Parts</hi> of some, more generally known.
Which having done, I shall next observe the <hi>Uses</hi> of the same; either
for the <hi>Fruit</hi> it self, or for the <hi>Seed.</hi> Some of the <hi>Descriptions,</hi> the
Reader may be pleased to compare with those in the <hi>First Book,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ch. 6.</note>
I begin with the <hi>Apple;</hi> to which I shall subjoyn the <hi>Limon,</hi> and <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumer,</hi>
commonly reduced to the <hi>Pome Kind.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. AN APPLE, besides the <hi>Skin,</hi> consisteth of a <hi>Parenchyma,
Vessels,</hi> and <hi>Coar.</hi> The <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or <hi>Pulp,</hi> is the same with that of the
<hi>Barque</hi> of the <hi>Tree.</hi> As is apparent, not only from the visible conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
thereof from the one, through the <hi>Stalk,</hi> into the other: but
also from the Structure common to them both; being both composed
of <hi>Bladders.</hi> In which, notwithstanding, there is this difference,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100350:118"/>
That whereas in the <hi>Barque,</hi> they are <hi>spherical,</hi> and very small, most of
them, through a good <hi>Glass,</hi> not exceeding 1/10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of an Inch in <hi>Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,</hi>
and some of them, less: here, they are oblong and very large, most
of them about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <hi rend="sup">d</hi> of an Inch in Length,<note place="margin">Tab. 65.</note> or more, according to the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and tenderness of the <hi>Fruit;</hi> being all uniformly tenter'd or
stretched out, by the <hi>arching</hi> of the <hi>Vessels,</hi> from the <hi>Coar</hi> towards the
Circumference of the <hi>Apple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. The <hi>Vessels,</hi> as in the other <hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> are <hi>Succiferous,</hi>
and for <hi>Aer.</hi> Both the <hi>Branches</hi> of the former, and the single <hi>Vessels</hi>
of the latter, are extream small. They run every where together, not
collateral,<note place="margin">Tab. 65.</note> as <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> do in <hi>Animals;</hi> but the latter, sheathed
in the former.</p>
                     <p>5. §. They are distributed into Twenty principal <hi>Branches.</hi> The Ten
outmost, a little within the <hi>Apple,</hi> are diverted from a straight <hi>Line,</hi> into
so many great <hi>Arches;</hi> from which a few small <hi>Fibres</hi> are without any
order dispearsed through the <hi>Apple.</hi> The Five middlemost, and the
Five inmost, run in a straight <hi>Line</hi> as far as the <hi>Coar,</hi> and are there di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into as many lesser <hi>Arches;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 65.</note> the former, at the outer, and the
latter at the iner <hi>Angles</hi> of the <hi>Coar.</hi> Upon these Five inmost hang all
the <hi>Seeds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. These Ten, and the other Ten abovesaid, do all meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the top of the <hi>Apple,</hi> where originally, they all ran into the
<hi>Flower.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 65.</note> But betwixt them, there are scarce any intercurrent <hi>Fibres;</hi>
so that they appear every where disjunct from the bottom to the top
of the <hi>Apple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. A LIMON hath a Threefold <hi>Parenchyma;</hi> which seem
to be derived one from another: the <hi>Texture,</hi> upon every derivation,
being somewhat altered,<note place="margin">Tab. 66.</note> and so made more close and elaborate. The
utmost, called the <hi>Rind,</hi> hath the most open, and the coursest <hi>Texture;</hi>
being composed of the largest <hi>Threds,</hi> and those <hi>Threds</hi> woven up into
larger <hi>Bladders.</hi> Those little <hi>Cells,</hi> which contein the <hi>Essential Oyl</hi> of
the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and stand near the Surface of the <hi>Rind,</hi> are some of the said
<hi>Bladders</hi> much more dilated.</p>
                     <p>8. §. From this utmost <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> Nine or Ten <hi>Insertions</hi> or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mells</hi>
are produced, betwixt as many <hi>Portions</hi> of the <hi>Pulpy Part,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Centre, where they all unite into one <hi>Body,</hi> answerable to
the <hi>Pith</hi> in the <hi>Trunk</hi> or <hi>Root</hi> of a <hi>Tree;</hi> and is a conspicuous demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
of the communion betwixt the <hi>Barque</hi> and the <hi>Pith;</hi> which
there,<note place="margin">Tab. 66.</note> is much more obscure and difficult to observe. At the bottom,
but especially the top of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> the <hi>Pith</hi> is so far expanded, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the mediation of any <hi>Lamels,</hi> to be joyned to the <hi>Rind.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. Throughout this <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> the <hi>Vessels</hi> are dispearsed. But
the chief <hi>Branches</hi> stand on the iner Edge of the <hi>Rind,</hi> and the outer
Edge of the <hi>Pith,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 66.</note> just at the two extremities of every <hi>Lamel.</hi> From
those <hi>Branches</hi> on the Edge of the <hi>Pith,</hi> other little and very short
ones shoot into the <hi>Pulp</hi> of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> upon which the <hi>Seeds</hi> are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant.
In the Centre of the <hi>Pith,</hi> are Eight or Nine, in a <hi>Ring,</hi>
which run through the <hi>Fruit</hi> up to the <hi>Flower.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. §. Between the <hi>Rind</hi> and the <hi>Pith</hi> and those several <hi>Lamels,</hi>
which joyn them together, stands the second Sort of <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the former, in being somewhat closer, and finer wrought
Divided, by the <hi>Lamels,</hi> into several distinct Bodies; every one of them
a great and entire <hi>Bag.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:100350:118"/>
11. §. Within every great <hi>Bag,</hi> is conteined a Third <hi>Parenchyma,</hi>
which is also a Cluster of other little <hi>Bags,</hi> about the bigness of an
<hi>Oate,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 66.</note> all disjoyned one from another, and having their distinct <hi>Stalks,</hi>
of several <hi>Lengths,</hi> by which they are all fastned to the utmost Side of
the great <hi>Bag,</hi> wherein they are conteined. Within each of these lesser
<hi>Bags</hi> are conteined many hundreds of <hi>Bladders,</hi> consisting of most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
fine <hi>Threds</hi> woven up together into that <hi>Figure.</hi> Within these
<hi>Bladders</hi> lies the <hi>Acid Juyce</hi> of the <hi>Limon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. §. A CUCUMER, hath also a Threefold <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> The
Utmost, is derived, from the <hi>Barque.</hi> In this, being exposed for some
time to dry, and then cut transversly with a <hi>Rasor;</hi> not only the <hi>Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
but also the <hi>Threds</hi> whereof the <hi>Bladders</hi> consist, through a good
<hi>Microscope,</hi> are apparent.</p>
                     <p>13. §. Throughout this <hi>Parenchyma</hi> the <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> are dispersed;
near the Circumference,<note place="margin">Tab. 66.</note> in Ten or Twelve very large <hi>Branches.</hi> Each
of these larger <hi>Branches,</hi> embosoms another of <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> in its Centre.
Adjacent to the Midle <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> they stand in <hi>Clustres</hi> of much
smaller <hi>Branches,</hi> but more numerous.</p>
                     <p>14. §. Out of all these <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi> issues a transparent and viscous
<hi>Mucilage;</hi> which being dryed, becomes as hard and tough as <hi>Gum Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacanth.</hi>
Analogous to which, I suppose, is the truly purgative part of
<hi>Elaterium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>15. §. The Midle <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is derived from the <hi>Pith;</hi> and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into Three <hi>Colums,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 66.</note> standing triangularly, and having each of them
a <hi>Triangular Figure.</hi> Within these <hi>Colums</hi> stand a distinct Sort of <hi>Sap-Vessels:</hi>
from whence, several small and short <hi>Fibres</hi> shoot into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<hi>Parenchyma,</hi> whereupon the <hi>Seeds</hi> do hang. So that these <hi>Columns</hi>
are as it were the <hi>Beds</hi> on which the <hi>Seeds</hi> grow. With each of the
<hi>Seed-Branchs</hi> or <hi>Fibres,</hi> goes some part of the said <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or <hi>Colum,</hi>
out of which, the <hi>Covers</hi> of the <hi>Seed</hi> are formed.</p>
                     <p>16. §. The Inmost <hi>Parenchyma</hi> wherein the <hi>Seeds</hi> lie, and which
answers to the <hi>Pulp</hi> of a <hi>Limon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 66.</note> seems likewise to be derived from the
<hi>Colums,</hi> that is, to be originally thence produced upon the <hi>Seed-Fibres,</hi>
and afterwards spread and augmented into a <hi>Pulp.</hi> By Three <hi>Inserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
from the <hi>Colums,</hi> and as many from the Utmost <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> and
these re-inserted; it is divided into Six <hi>Triangular Bodies;</hi> and every
<hi>Triangle,</hi> into Three <hi>Ovals.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>17. §. A near resemblance betwixt the <hi>Garden</hi> and <hi>Wild Cucumer,</hi>
with respect to the Inward <hi>Structure,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 66.</note> as well as the Outward <hi>Figure,</hi>
may be observed: Both of them having a Threefold <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> Yet
with this difference, That the Three <hi>White Triangular Bodies</hi> or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums</hi>
in the one, is answered by a <hi>White Ring</hi> or <hi>Tube</hi> in the other.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>PEAR, besides the <hi>Skin,</hi> consisteth of a Twofold
<hi>Parenchyma,</hi> of <hi>Vessels, Tartareous Knots</hi> or <hi>Grains,</hi>
and a <hi>Coar.</hi> The <hi>Skin</hi> is lined with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

as in a Slice of a <hi>Pear</hi> cut transversly is apparent. Somewhat
more or less, as I take it, according to the Delicacy or Harshness of the
<hi>Fruit;</hi> as more in a <hi>Burgamy,</hi> or other soft and sweet <hi>Pear,</hi> than in those
which are called <hi>Strangulatoria.</hi> As all <hi>Vinous Liquors,</hi> and those espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
which are the most <hi>Tartareous,</hi> become more soft and sweet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as they cast off their <hi>Tartar,</hi> in a greater quantity, upon the
Sides of the <hi>Vessel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. The Outer <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> is of the same Original, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Structure, as in an <hi>Apple.</hi> But the <hi>Bladders,</hi> answerable to the Shape
of this <hi>Fruit,</hi> not altogether so long, with respect to their Bredth.
Throughout this <hi>Parenchyma,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 67.</note> are also dispersed many small <hi>Tartareous
Grains;</hi> most of them somewhat round, as those next the <hi>Skin,</hi> and
of a like <hi>Size;</hi> but nothing near so numerous.</p>
                     <p>3. §. The <hi>Bladders</hi> here, have also a different <hi>Position</hi> from that
they have in an <hi>Apple:</hi> there, they are all so stretched out, as to have
respect to one common Centre, which is that of the <hi>Apple</hi> it self. But
here,<note place="margin">Tab. 67.</note> they every where bear a respect to the said <hi>Tartareous Grains,</hi> every
<hi>Grain</hi> being the Centre of a certain Number of <hi>Bladders;</hi> like a <hi>Star,</hi>
in the midle of its <hi>Vortex.</hi> Whereby, so many of the <hi>Tartareous parts</hi>
of the <hi>Sap,</hi> as cannot well be thrown off upon the <hi>Skin,</hi> are more
commodiously discharged, upon every little <hi>Knot</hi> or <hi>Grain,</hi> nearer
hand.</p>
                     <p>4. §. Throughout this <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> the <hi>Vessels</hi> likewise are disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Of the Two general Kinds, for <hi>Sap,</hi> and for <hi>Aer.</hi> The <hi>Aer-Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,</hi>
are here extream small, as well as in an <hi>Apple;</hi> yet one degree,
larger. They are both together distributed into Fifteen principal
<hi>Branches.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 67.</note> The Five Utmost make as many <hi>Arches,</hi> but commonly not
near so deep as in an <hi>Apple.</hi> From these, some small <hi>Fibres,</hi> yet a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more numerously than in an <hi>Apple,</hi> are dispersed throughout the
<hi>Parenchyma.</hi> The Ten Inmost run along to the <hi>Seed,</hi> and from thence,
with the other Five, to the <hi>Flower.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. Next the <hi>Coar,</hi> stands the Inner <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> in divers respects
different from the Outer. The <hi>Bladders</hi> of the latter, as hath been
said, large and long; of the former, small and round, answerable to
those of the <hi>Pith,</hi> of which it seems to be derived. Throughout that,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100350:119"/>
the <hi>Vessels</hi> and <hi>Tartareous Grains</hi> are dispersed; in this, there are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">Tab. 67.</note>
The <hi>Effect</hi> whereof is, that is sweet, this sower; for which
reason, I have taken leave to name it, the <hi>Acetary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. Betwixt this and the outer <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> the said <hi>Tartareous
Grains</hi> begin, first to stand nearer together, to grow biger, and of a
more unequal Surface;<note place="margin">Tab. 67.</note> and by degrees, to unite into a <hi>Body,</hi> in some
<hi>Pears,</hi> and especially towards the <hi>Cork,</hi> almost as hard as a <hi>Plum-Stone;</hi>
which I have thereupon,<note place="margin">B. 1. Ch. 6.</note> named the <hi>Calculary.</hi> So that a <hi>Pear,</hi> is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. This <hi>Tartareous Body,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">B. 1. Ch. 6.</note> and those small <hi>Grains</hi> above said, I
have formerly supposed, to be precipitated out of the <hi>Sap,</hi> by virtue of
the <hi>Vessels.</hi> Which is not only argued from their growing, where
the <hi>Vessels,</hi> only in the outer <hi>Parenchyma:</hi> but in that the very <hi>Bounds</hi>
or <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Calculary,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 67.</note> is determined by the <hi>Situation</hi> of the chief of
those <hi>Vessels;</hi> as in cuting a <hi>Pear</hi> smoothly through the Centre and by
the Length, is apparent.</p>
                     <p>8. §. The <hi>Coar</hi> as well as the <hi>Acetary,</hi> seems to be derived from the
<hi>Pith.</hi> And is therefore lesser here, than in an <hi>Apple,</hi> where the whole
<hi>Pith</hi> of the <hi>Stalk,</hi> goes to the making of the <hi>Coar</hi> only.</p>
                     <p>9. §. In most <hi>Pears,</hi> at the bottom of the <hi>Coar,</hi> and a little below
the Centre of the <hi>Fruit,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 67.</note> there is a kind of small <hi>Umbelical Knot;</hi> from
whence is extended a straight <hi>Chanel</hi> or <hi>Ductus,</hi> which opens at the
midle of the <hi>Cork</hi> or <hi>Stool</hi> of the <hi>Flower,</hi> scarce wide enough to admit
the smallest <hi>Pin.</hi> Made for the <hi>Use</hi> hereafter mentioned.</p>
                     <p>10. §. A QUINCE, is nearly allyed to a <hi>Pear.</hi> The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
betwixt them are these; In the <hi>Quince,</hi> the outer <hi>Parenchyma</hi>
is more close,<note place="margin">Tab. 67.</note> that is, the <hi>Bladders</hi> are smaller. The <hi>Vessels</hi> more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
and more deeply enarched; the <hi>Calculary</hi> greater, and more
spread; according to the <hi>Shape</hi> of the <hi>Fruit:</hi> but the <hi>Acetary,</hi> less:
The <hi>Coar</hi> stands higher or nearer to the <hi>Cork;</hi> divided, not into Five,
but Four <hi>Cells.</hi> And the <hi>Ductus</hi> from the bottom of the <hi>Coar</hi> to the

the <hi>Glass</hi> I used, when I examined this <hi>Fruit,</hi> would not reach it; yet
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100350:120"/>
is it to be presumed, that they bear a just Proportion to those in the

in an <hi>Apple</hi> or <hi>Pear.</hi> The <hi>Skin</hi> likewise of a <hi>Plum,</hi> is more <hi>fibrous,
thick,</hi> and <hi>tough,</hi> than in those <hi>Fruits.</hi> The Ends of these Diversities,
we shall presently speak of.</p>
                     <p>2. §. Of the <hi>Stone,</hi> amongst other particulars wherein the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of Nature is very admirable,<note place="margin">B. 1. Ch. 6.</note> I have formerly shewed, That
it is composed of Two or rather Three distinct <hi>Bodies.</hi> One of them,
the <hi>Lining;</hi> which answers to the <hi>Coar</hi> in a <hi>Pear.</hi> And is originated
from the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> which the <hi>Seed-Branch</hi> brings along with it,
through the <hi>Chanel</hi> in the <hi>Side,</hi> and at last into the <hi>Hollow,</hi> of the
<hi>Stone;</hi> and is there spread all over it: as when a small <hi>Glass-Pipe,</hi> is
blown and expanded into a <hi>Bubble.</hi> Or as if a <hi>Bladder,</hi> being stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and put through the <hi>Neck</hi> of a <hi>Bottle;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 68.</note> were then blown up, so
as to be every where contiguous to the <hi>Sides,</hi> and become, as it were,
the <hi>Lining</hi> of the <hi>Bottle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. The <hi>Foundation</hi> or <hi>Ground</hi> of the Outer and more Bulky
<hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Stone,</hi> is the Iner <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma;</hi> and answers
to the <hi>Acetary</hi> in a <hi>Pear.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 68.</note> As the <hi>Fruit</hi> grows, the <hi>Tartareous Parts</hi>
of the <hi>Sap,</hi> being continually precipitated upon this <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> it is
hereby petrify'd. As will best be seen, by comparing the several <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
of the same <hi>Fruit</hi> together. And in some <hi>Stones;</hi> on the Surface
whereof,<note place="margin">Tab. 68.</note> some of the said <hi>Tartareous Parts</hi> appear in distinct <hi>Grains.</hi>
So that whereas in a <hi>Pear,</hi> the <hi>Calculary</hi> and the <hi>Acetary</hi> are distinct,
here in a <hi>Plum,</hi> they are thrown one into the other. Or, as some
<hi>Mineral Waters</hi> only make a Crust about a Stick or other Bodies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersed
in them; but others, by sinking into these Bodies, do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
petrify them: So in a <hi>Pear,</hi> the <hi>Tartareous Parts</hi> of the <hi>Sap,</hi> only
make a <hi>Crust</hi> about the <hi>Acetary;</hi> but in a <hi>Plum,</hi> they sink into the
Body thereof, or that <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> which stands in the
place of it, whereby it is converted into a <hi>Stone.</hi> The <hi>Figures</hi> of <hi>Stones</hi>
shall hereafter be spoken of, when I come in the next <hi>Part,</hi> to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. AN APRECOCK is of the <hi>Plum-Kind.</hi> But some
things are herein better observed. As first, the <hi>Position</hi> of the <hi>Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
of the <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> For the <hi>Tartareous Parts</hi> of the <hi>Sap</hi> not being
here dispersed, in little <hi>Grains,</hi> throughout the <hi>Fruit,</hi> as in a <hi>Pear;</hi>
but all thrown off into the <hi>Stone:</hi> the <hi>Bladders</hi> therefore are so dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
as not to have respect to several <hi>Centres,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 68.</note> as in a <hi>Pear;</hi> but only the
<hi>Stone,</hi> to which they all do most exactly radiate; thereto conveying
the <hi>feculent Sap,</hi> in so many little <hi>Streams.</hi> This is best seen, when the
<hi>Fruit</hi> is full ripe.</p>
                     <p>5. §. In this <hi>Fruit,</hi> while it is young, the gradual transmutation of
the Inner <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> into a <hi>Stone,</hi> is also more apparent.
And so are the Three <hi>Coats,</hi> which serve for the <hi>Generation</hi> of the
<hi>Seed;</hi> being now all very distinct; and remarkable, not only for
their <hi>Bulk;</hi> but also, the <hi>Analogy</hi> which they bear to the Three <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes</hi>
in many <hi>Viviparous Animals.</hi> Whereof I shall give a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Description,</hi> when I come, in the following <hi>Part,</hi> to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. A PEACH hath a much bigger Stone, than either a <hi>Plum,</hi>
or an <hi>Aprecock:</hi> and hath therefore, when full ripe, and especially in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100350:120"/>
hot Countries, a more defecated or better fined <hi>Juyce.</hi> For the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why the <hi>Stone</hi> is so great, is because the <hi>Vessels</hi> run so very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merously
through the Body of it; and so cause a more copious preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation
of the <hi>Lees</hi> of the <hi>Sap</hi> thereinto.</p>
                     <p>7. §. A CHEERY is likewise near related to a <hi>Plum.</hi> But
the <hi>Bracement</hi> or <hi>Reticulation</hi> of the <hi>Vessels,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 69.</note> is here carried out further,
so as to be all round about contiguous to the <hi>Skin.</hi> And as the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi>
in the <hi>Branch</hi> of a <hi>Cherry-Tree,</hi> are larger than those of an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Branch,</hi>
but less than those of a <hi>Plum-Branch;</hi> so may they be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
to bear the same Proportion here in the <hi>Fruit,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. A WALNUT, is a <hi>Nuciprune;</hi> or betwixt a <hi>Plum</hi> and a
<hi>Nut,</hi> as a <hi>Bat</hi> is betwixt a <hi>Beast</hi> and a <hi>Bird.</hi> For the <hi>Rind,</hi> answers to
the <hi>Pulp;</hi> and the <hi>Shell,</hi> as the <hi>Stone,</hi> is also lined. But the <hi>Seed-Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,</hi>
which in a <hi>Plum</hi> run through a <hi>Chanel</hi> made on purpose in the
<hi>Stone;</hi> do here enter, as in a <hi>Nut,</hi> at the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Shell.</hi> By which
means, they are invested with a more fair <hi>Parenchyma;</hi> which Nature
hath provided, as her <hi>Cloth,</hi> for the making of the <hi>Coats</hi> wide enough
for so vast a <hi>Kernel.</hi>

That many <hi>Lignous Fibres</hi> are visibly mixed with the <hi>Skin</hi> it self:

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the forementioned <hi>Fruits,</hi> I shall subjoyne, in some
Examples, the <hi>Description</hi> of the <hi>Seed-Case,</hi> which
is analogous to the <hi>Fruit.</hi> For the <hi>Fruit,</hi> strictly so
called, is, <hi>A Fleshy Uterus, which grows more moist and
Pulpy, as the Seed ripens.</hi> But the <hi>Seed-Case,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be called a <hi>Cod, Pod,</hi> or by any other name,
is, <hi>A Membraneous Uterus, which as the Seed ripens,
still grows the more dry and hard:</hi> as in most <hi>Plants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. THE SEED-CASE, is either originally open; Or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when the <hi>Seed</hi> is ripe; Or never opens at all, till the <hi>Seed</hi> be sown.
Of the first Sort, is that of <hi>Luteola;</hi> as also of <hi>Clary, Sage, Hysop,</hi> and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100350:121"/>
the like: wherein one and the same <hi>Part,</hi> is both the <hi>Empalement</hi> of the
<hi>Flower,</hi> and when that is gone, survives as the <hi>Case</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. Of the Last, is that of <hi>Myagrum Monspermon, Lithosperme,</hi>
all the <hi>Stones</hi> of <hi>Fruits,</hi> with divers others. And some <hi>Cases,</hi> which
are soft, as, I think, that of <hi>Garden Radish.</hi> The former, by cleaving
in some <hi>part</hi> or other; these only by roting under Ground.</p>
                     <p>4. §. THAT of <hi>Garden Radish,</hi> is a Light and Spongy or Pithy
<hi>Body;</hi> originally, every where entire. But, as it ripens, breaks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,<note place="margin">Tab. 70.</note>
into several White and Dry <hi>Membranes</hi> round about the <hi>Seed.</hi> By
the Length and about ⅛<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of an Inch distant from the <hi>Sides</hi> of the <hi>Case,</hi>
do run a pair of little <hi>Vascular Ropes.</hi> Some smaller <hi>Fibres</hi> are from
these transmitted to the <hi>Sides</hi> of the <hi>Case;</hi> by which they are kept

the <hi>Seeds,</hi> like Two <hi>Ropes</hi> of <hi>Onions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. Of those which open so soon as the <hi>Seed</hi> is ripe; some are
made to open at the <hi>Top,</hi> as <hi>Popy Heads;</hi> Some on the <hi>Side,</hi> as most
<hi>Cods;</hi> and some at the <hi>Bottom,</hi> as that of <hi>Coded Arsmart.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <note place="margin">Tab. 70.</note> into so many <hi>Stalls.</hi> On both <hi>Sides</hi> the <hi>Partitions,</hi>
hangs a most numerous <hi>Brood</hi> of <hi>Seeds.</hi> The <hi>Partitions</hi> and <hi>Sides</hi> of
the <hi>Head,</hi> are made of the <hi>Barque,</hi> and Lined with the <hi>Pith.</hi> While
young, they are very <hi>thick</hi> and <hi>spongy;</hi> and together with the <hi>Seeds,</hi> do
then fill all up. The <hi>Head</hi> is then also every where entire; but as it dries,
it gradually opens at the <hi>Top,</hi> into several <hi>Windows,</hi> one for every <hi>Stall:</hi>
which are all covered with a very fair <hi>Canopy.</hi> A <hi>Fabrick</hi> designed for
several purposes, as shall hearafter be said.</p>
                     <p>7. §. Of those which open on the <hi>Side;</hi> some are made to open,
only on One <hi>Side;</hi> some, on both <hi>Sides;</hi> some, with Three <hi>Sides;</hi>
some, with more; and some horizontally or round about.</p>
                     <p>8. §. THE COD of <hi>Garden Bean</hi> (and so the rest of the <hi>Legu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous</hi>

those lesser <hi>Fibres</hi> upon which the <hi>Beans</hi> do grow.</p>
                     <p>9. §. The Inner <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is derived from the <hi>Pith.</hi> Upon its
Nativity, and for some time afterwards, entire and wholly composed of
<hi>Bladders,</hi> as the Outer. From the <hi>Base</hi> of the <hi>Cod</hi> they are gradually

On the <hi>Top,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 70.</note> is erected a <hi>Colum,</hi> about ½ an Inch long; which, as the

as it ages, gradually cleaves on both <hi>Sides</hi> asunder.</p>
                     <p>13. §. The <hi>Case</hi> is lined with a dry and thin <hi>Parchment,</hi> as

Throughout this <hi>Bed,</hi> the <hi>Vessels</hi> for the <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Nourishment</hi> of

                        <note place="margin">Tab. 71.</note> and so parting it into Six <hi>Stalls</hi> for the <hi>Seed.</hi> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
hereof, are, lined with a thin smooth and glossy <hi>Parchment,</hi> like
that in <hi>Hen-bean;</hi> derived from the <hi>Pith;</hi> as the outside, from the
<hi>Barque:</hi> and so in many other <hi>Seed-Cases.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>15. §. The <hi>Vessels,</hi> after they rise above the <hi>Stalk,</hi> are disposed
with great <hi>artifice.</hi> For first, they are divided into Three principal
<hi>Branches,</hi> which run a long the Three <hi>Angles</hi> of the <hi>Case;</hi> where the
Three <hi>Sides,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 71.</note> as it ages, gradually cleave asunder. From these chief
<hi>Branches,</hi> at the Three <hi>Angles,</hi> divers lesser ones run horizontally, and
meet at the midle of each <hi>Side.</hi> From whence again, many yet smaller
ones are produced through the bredth of each <hi>Partition</hi> to their Edges
in the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Case.</hi> Where, once more, they are distributed into
very fine and short <hi>Threds,</hi> whereupon hang the <hi>Seeds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. §. THE <hi>Seed-Case</hi> of <hi>Stramonium</hi> or <hi>Thorn Apple,</hi> is divided
into Four <hi>Closets:</hi> Not open one into another, as in <hi>Poppy, Tulip,</hi> &amp;c.
but so many distinct <hi>Inclosures.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 71.</note> In the midst of each <hi>Closet</hi> stands a
<hi>Colum,</hi> joyned to the <hi>Side</hi> of the <hi>Closet</hi> by a <hi>Wall</hi> or <hi>Lamine.</hi> Through
the Length of the <hi>Colums</hi> run several greater and lesser <hi>Branches</hi> of
<hi>Vessels,</hi> from whence others are obliquely produced, upon which the
<hi>Seeds</hi> grow.</p>
                     <p>17. §. THE <hi>Seed-Case</hi> of <hi>Anagallis</hi> or <hi>Pimpernel,</hi> is a little <hi>Globe;</hi>
which opens not by its <hi>Meridian</hi> or <hi>Vertically,</hi> as do the former; but
by its <hi>Horizon.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 71.</note> For divers very small <hi>Fibres,</hi> being produced from the
<hi>Stalk</hi> to the midle of the <hi>Case;</hi> do there fetch a <hi>Circle,</hi> and so divide it
exactly into Two <hi>Hemispheres:</hi> the Uppermost of which, when the
<hi>Seeds</hi> are ripe, falleth off; and so the wind sowes them.</p>
                     <p>18. §. THE <hi>Seed-Case</hi> of <hi>Coded Arsmart,</hi> neither opens at the
<hi>Top,</hi> nor on the <hi>Sides,</hi> as do all the former; but at the <hi>Bottom.</hi> It is
composed of Four <hi>Sides:</hi> the Outer Part of which, is softer and more
<hi>succulent;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 71.</note> the Inner a tite and strong <hi>Membrane.</hi> In the <hi>Centre</hi> of the
<hi>Case,</hi> is erected a <hi>Pole</hi> or <hi>Colum</hi> upon which the <hi>Seeds</hi> do all hang very
loosely.</p>
                     <p>19. §. From this <hi>Mechanism,</hi> the manner of that violent and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising
<hi>Ejaculation</hi> of the <hi>Seeds,</hi> is intelligible. Which is not a motion
originally in the <hi>Seeds</hi> themselves; but contrived by the <hi>Structure</hi> of
the <hi>Case.</hi> For the <hi>Seeds</hi> hanging very loose, and not on the <hi>Sides</hi> of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100350:122"/>
the <hi>Case,</hi> as sometimes, but on the <hi>Pole,</hi> in the <hi>Centre,</hi> with their
thicker end downward, they stand ready for a discharge: and the <hi>Sides</hi>
of the <hi>Case</hi> being lined with a strong and Tensed <hi>Membrane,</hi> they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
perform the office of so many little <hi>Bows:</hi> which, remaining fast
at the <hi>Top,</hi> and (contrary to what we see in other <hi>Plants)</hi> opening or
being <hi>lett off</hi> at the <hi>Bottom,</hi> forceably curle upward, and so drive all
the <hi>Seeds</hi> before them.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VI. Of the USE of the Parts to the Fruit.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the forgoing <hi>Descriptions,</hi> I have already mention'd
the <hi>Use</hi> of the <hi>Parts</hi> in some particulars. I shall now
a little further explain the manner of their service,
both to the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and to the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. And first, the <hi>Vessels</hi> serve for the <hi>Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>Fruit.</hi> So in an <hi>Apple,</hi> the Ten great and
utmost <hi>Branches</hi> serve not only to nourish and feed
it; but also, by the <hi>Arched Lines</hi> they draw, to direct and govern the
<hi>Growth</hi> thereof into an orbicular <hi>Figure.</hi> The <hi>Dilatation</hi> of these
<hi>Vessels,</hi> not being hindred by any <hi>Braces</hi> or <hi>Conjunction</hi> with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior</hi>
ones. By the <hi>Slenderness</hi> of the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> as in the <hi>Root,</hi> so
here in the <hi>Fruit,</hi> much promoted. And by their <hi>Saline Principle,</hi>
first begun.</p>
                     <p>3. §. The Five midlemost and the Five Inmost serve together, to
figure the <hi>Coar;</hi> the former bounding the Outer, the Latter, the Iner
<hi>Angles.</hi> For were they only Five, or were all Ten in the same <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi>
they would only make a round <hi>Cavity</hi> like that of a hollow <hi>Pith.</hi>
Hence it is that <hi>Apples,</hi> in which some small <hi>Threds</hi> of the <hi>Vessels</hi> strike
out into the <hi>Circumference,</hi> are very Uneven with divers <hi>Knobs</hi> and
<hi>Ridges.</hi> But <hi>Plums, Cherries,</hi> &amp;c. where the <hi>Vessels</hi> all terminate at
an Equal distance from the <hi>Skin,</hi> are Even all round about.</p>
                     <p>4. §. The <hi>Bulk</hi> of the <hi>Fruit</hi> dependeth also on the <hi>Braces</hi> of the
<hi>Vessels.</hi> For in <hi>Plums</hi> and <hi>Cherries,</hi> they are more numerous; but in
<hi>Apples</hi> and <hi>Pears</hi> they are very loose one from another, and so have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
left them to spread abroad.</p>
                     <p>5. §. As also on their <hi>Size;</hi> that is, on the <hi>Size</hi> of the <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi>
Which, the less they are themselves, they serve to make a bigger <hi>Fruit.</hi>
As the less they are in any <hi>Root,</hi> they serve to make it the more ample.
For the less they are, the more pliable to the <hi>Attraction</hi> of the <hi>Aer:</hi>
and in their <hi>Growth</hi> must make so many more spiral <hi>Rings:</hi> by both
which means, they make the greater <hi>Arches.</hi> And therefore a <hi>Pear</hi> is
commonly a smaller <hi>Fruit</hi> than an <hi>Apple;</hi> a <hi>Plum</hi> than a <hi>Pear;</hi> and a
<hi>Grape,</hi> than a <hi>Plum;</hi> in all which the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> are still greater and
greater.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:100350:123"/>
6. §. From the same Cause, it is also most agreeable, That the
<hi>Fruit</hi> should not come before the <hi>Leaves</hi> or <hi>Flower,</hi> but last of all. For
the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> as hath been often noted, are not exactly <hi>Cylindrick,</hi>
but tapered; that is, not only the <hi>Fibres</hi> consisting of divers of these
<hi>Vessels,</hi> but the <hi>Vessels</hi> themselves, as they ascend into the <hi>Trunck,
Branches, Leaves, Flower,</hi> and <hi>Fruit,</hi> grow still more and more slender.
So that the smallest coming last, and being the most pliable; they are
also best accommodated for the <hi>Expansion</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> into that
we call the <hi>Fruit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. It is likewise a proper Question to be asked, How it comes
to pass, That some <hi>Plants</hi> bear a <hi>Fruit,</hi> and not all? I answer, That
as the <hi>Size</hi> of the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> conduceth to the <hi>Bulk</hi> of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and
the Order of its Growth: So the <hi>Number</hi> of them, to their being, or
not being, any <hi>Fruit</hi> at all. For the <hi>Fruit,</hi> as we have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
it, is an <hi>Uterus,</hi> which grows moyster and softer, as the <hi>Seed</hi>
ripens. The reason therefore, why the <hi>Uterus</hi> in some <hi>Plants,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
moist and soft after the <hi>Seed</hi> is ripe; and in some, dries up; is,
Because in the former, there is a smaller, in the latter, a greater Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> in proportion to the other <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Uterus,</hi>
and so a greater quantity of <hi>Aer.</hi> Which as in the <hi>Pith</hi> of most <hi>Plants,</hi>
so here, by degrees excludes the <hi>Sap,</hi> or rendring it more evaporable,
comes in the room of it; and so the <hi>Uterus</hi> is dryed up: that is, there
is no <hi>Fruit</hi> produced, but only a <hi>Seed-Case.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. From the <hi>Size, Number,</hi> and <hi>Position</hi> of all the <hi>Vessels</hi> in <hi>Fruits</hi>
a reason also may be given, for the diversity of their <hi>Tasts.</hi> Some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
have before been given; to which I shall add one or two more.
So the <hi>Rind</hi> of an <hi>Orange,</hi> is bitter; the <hi>Pulp,</hi> sower. Because the
former is furnished with many <hi>Lignous Vessels,</hi> the <hi>Sulphureous</hi> or <hi>Oyly
Tincture</hi> whereof, being copiously mixed with the <hi>Acid</hi> of the <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma,</hi>
produce that <hi>Tast.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Pulp,</hi> which is very sower, is
void of all manner of <hi>Vessels.</hi> But if the <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> are either less nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
or less <hi>Sulphureous;</hi> they give so mild a <hi>Tincture</hi> to the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi>
as not to produce a bitter, but a sweet or soft <hi>Tast;</hi> as in <hi>Apples, Grapes,
Goosberries,</hi> &amp;c. And of a <hi>Goosberry,</hi> it is particularly to be noted,
that whereas, in a <hi>Limon,</hi> the <hi>Pulp</hi> only is sower, as being void of
<hi>Vessels:</hi> here, on the contrary, the <hi>Pulp</hi> only is sweet, whereinto all
the <hi>Vessels</hi> strike, and the <hi>Rind</hi> sower.</p>
                     <p>9. §. The diversities of the <hi>Skin</hi> it self, have their <hi>Use.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the more tender and delicate the <hi>Fruit is;</hi> the <hi>Skin,</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
is thicker and more tough. So <hi>Apples</hi> have a thicker <hi>Skin,</hi> than
<hi>Pears; Plums,</hi> than <hi>Apples;</hi> and <hi>Grapes</hi> than <hi>Plums;</hi> those having as
it were, only a <hi>Coat</hi> of <hi>Kid,</hi> but this of good thick <hi>Buff.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
some <hi>Fruits,</hi> although tender, yet either not having so rich a
<hi>Juyce,</hi> or coming early, and so not being exposed to excessive heats,
have a very thin <hi>Skin,</hi> as <hi>Mulberries, Strawberries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND first, for example, in an <hi>Apple,</hi> the Five In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<hi>Branches,</hi> do best serve for the <hi>Generation</hi> of
the <hi>Seed;</hi> these running into the <hi>Attire</hi> of the
<hi>Flower,</hi> and so carrying off the most <hi>Aerial Spirit</hi>
from the <hi>Seed;</hi> by which means, it becomes a more

more accommodate to the process of <hi>Vegetation;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">P. 2. Ch. 5. §. 5.</note> as
hath formerly been shewed.</p>
                     <p>2. §. The <hi>Elongation</hi> likewise of the <hi>Seed-Vessels,</hi> in the <hi>Fruit</hi> and
<hi>Case,</hi> sometimes directly, as in <hi>Plums</hi> and <hi>Nuts,</hi> and sometimes by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Ambages</hi> before they shoot into the <hi>Seeds,</hi> as in <hi>Tulip;</hi> shewes a
design for the highest refining and maturation of the <hi>Seminal Sap.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. Chiefly by means of the Inmost <hi>Vessels,</hi> is made that <hi>Chanel</hi>
in some <hi>Pears,</hi> and especially in <hi>Quinces.</hi> For these perishing with
the <hi>Flower,</hi> the circumjacent <hi>Parenchyma</hi> shrinks up, leaving the said
<hi>Chanel</hi> in the midst. Designed for an inlet to the <hi>Aer,</hi> for the better
drying of the <hi>Seeds;</hi> which here stand the more in need of it, because
encompassed with a <hi>Mucilage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. For the better drying of the <hi>Seed,</hi> and the disbursing or
sowing of it in due time, the opening of the <hi>Case</hi> is, in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
also contrived: either at the <hi>Top,</hi> as in <hi>Popy;</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> on the <hi>Sides,</hi> as
in <hi>Tulip, Pimpernel;</hi> or at the <hi>Bottom,</hi> as in <hi>Codded Arsmart.</hi> All which
openings are effected by the running of the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> along those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
for by drying the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> next adjacent, they cause it to chop
and cleave asunder.</p>
                     <p>5. §. Of the <hi>Seed-Case</hi> of <hi>Poppy,</hi> it is particularly to be noted,
That as the several <hi>Windows,</hi> serve to let in <hi>Aer,</hi> for the drying of the
<hi>Seeds,</hi> after their full Growth: So the <hi>Canopy</hi> over them, serves to
keep out <hi>Rain.</hi> For here, the <hi>Case</hi> not cleaving down the <hi>Side,</hi> as it
usually doth; should the <hi>Rain</hi> get in, it would stand in it, as in a <hi>Pot,</hi>
and so rot the <hi>Seeds.</hi> And as the <hi>Canopy</hi> serves to preserve the <hi>Seeds;</hi>
so the several <hi>Partitions</hi> or <hi>Walls,</hi> for their better <hi>Stowage.</hi> For by an
easie survey of this little piece of Ground, it is plain, that as they
stand on both <hi>Sides</hi> every <hi>Wall,</hi> there is as much more Ground for them
to stand upon, as if there were no parting <hi>Walls,</hi> but the <hi>Seeds</hi> stuck
all round about upon the <hi>Ambit</hi> or <hi>Sides</hi> of the <hi>Case;</hi> or upon a great
<hi>Bed</hi> or <hi>Placenta</hi> within it, as in <hi>Hyoscyamus, Anagallis,</hi> &amp;c. where there
is a less numerous <hi>Brood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:100350:124"/>
6. §. The <hi>Coar</hi> likewise, by standing betwixt the moyst <hi>Parenchyma</hi>
and the <hi>Seed,</hi> and being hollow and so silled with <hi>Aer;</hi> doth much
conduce to the ripening and drying of the <hi>Seed,</hi> and its greater fitness
both for keeping, and sowing. So the <hi>Parchment Lining</hi> of the <hi>Seed-Case,</hi>
as in <hi>Hyoscyamus,</hi> &amp;c. is answerable to a <hi>Coar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. The <hi>Parenchyma</hi> serveth, amongst other purposes, for the
<hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Covers</hi> of the <hi>Seed;</hi> as in some instances hath been
shewed. For which intent, sometimes the <hi>Exterior Parenchyma,</hi> as in
a <hi>Limon;</hi> sometimes the midlemost, as in a <hi>Goosberry</hi> or <hi>Cucumer,</hi> is
subservient; both of them, in those <hi>Fruits,</hi> being more white and dry,
than the rest, and so fiter to make the <hi>Covers</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. The <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is also of use for the warmth of the <hi>Seed;</hi>
as in the <hi>Seed-Case</hi> of <hi>Garden Radish.</hi> Wherein, as it ripens the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchyma</hi>
gradually drys, breaks, and shrinks up into several soft <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,</hi>
in which the <hi>Seeds,</hi> in the Centre of the <hi>Case,</hi> lie swadled, as in
so many sine <hi>Calico Clouts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. I SHALL conclude with observing the <hi>Time</hi> of the <hi>Generation</hi>
of the <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Seed-Case.</hi> This hath hitherto been thought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiated
upon the opening, I say not, the forming, but the opening of the
<hi>Flower,</hi> or not long before. Notwithstanding which, what I have
formerly said of the <hi>Flower;</hi> I now do the like, of the <hi>Uterus</hi> it self;
<hi>sc.</hi> That in very many <hi>Plants,</hi> 'tis formed, with the <hi>Flower,</hi> the year
before it appears and comes to its full <hi>Growth.</hi> As for instance, in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarum,</hi>
not only all the <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Flower,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 71.</note> but the <hi>Uterus</hi> it self, and
there in also the outer <hi>Cover</hi> of the <hi>Seed</hi> of any one year, are perfectly
formed in <hi>August</hi> or <hi>September</hi> of the year foregoing. The like may
be seen in <hi>Tulip, Mezereon, Corin,</hi> and many other <hi>Perennial Plants.</hi>

                     <head>THE
ANATOMY
OF
SEEDS. PART IV.</head>
                     <head>CHAP. I. Of the FIGURES of Seeds.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Figures</hi> of <hi>Seeds,</hi> or rather of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Covers,</hi> are made suitable, Partly to their
<hi>Collocation</hi> in the <hi>Uterus,</hi> as the <hi>End.</hi> So those
of <hi>Mallow,</hi> standing like a Coronet round the
<hi>Stalk,</hi> are of a wedged <hi>Figure;</hi> whereby their
sharp Edges do all meet together in one <hi>Centre.</hi>
Partly, to the various distribution of the <hi>Vessels</hi>
or <hi>Fibers,</hi> as one <hi>Cause:</hi> by which the <hi>Measures</hi>
and <hi>Surface</hi> of <hi>Seeds,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Leaves</hi>
of <hi>Plants,</hi> are diversified. And partly, to the Nature of the <hi>Saline</hi>
and other <hi>Principles</hi> regent in a <hi>Plant,</hi> as another principal <hi>Cause.</hi>
And therefore the more <hi>stony, brittle,</hi> or full of <hi>Salt</hi> the <hi>Covers</hi> of any
<hi>Seeds</hi> are, they are generally more <hi>angular,</hi> and their <hi>Figure,</hi> whether
<hi>angular</hi> or not, more constantly observed. So the <hi>Tartarcous Stone</hi> of
a <hi>Plum,</hi> is not only more <hi>angular,</hi> but also more regular than the Husk
of the Kernel of a <hi>Pear</hi> or <hi>Apple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. For all Stones are measured by several <hi>Circles,</hi> whose <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metres</hi>
hold a certain proportion to the Length of the <hi>Stone;</hi> in the
same manner as hath been shewed in the description of the <hi>Leaf.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">P. 1. <hi>Ch.</hi> 3.</note> So
the <hi>Stone</hi> of the <hi>Pease-Cod-Plum,</hi> is measured by two <hi>Circles.</hi> That of
the <hi>Turkey-Plum</hi> with Four.<note place="margin">Tab. 72.</note> That of the <hi>Aprecok-Plum,</hi> with Two
repeated oppositely; being perfectly <hi>Rhomboid.</hi> To which, those
also of the <hi>Wheat-Plum, Damasceen,</hi> and some others, allude. And some
are measured be four <hi>Circles,</hi> and one repeated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="196" facs="tcp:100350:126"/>
3. §. The <hi>Figures,</hi> not only of the larger sort of <hi>Seeds,</hi> but even
of the smallest, have much and elegant variety. We will take the
pleasure of comparing these which follow.</p>
                     <p>4. §. And first of all, some are perfectly <hi>Spherick,</hi> and with an even
<hi>Surface;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 73.</note> as that of little <hi>Century.</hi> That of <hi>Spergula</hi> is also <hi>Spherick;</hi>
but hath a knobed <hi>Surface,</hi> and is encompassed with a <hi>Membraneous
Rimm,</hi> like the <hi>Horizon</hi> of a Globe. That of little <hi>Celandine</hi> is Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
but compressed like a <hi>Cheese.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. Others are <hi>Nephroideous,</hi> or as it were <hi>Hemispherick.</hi> Of which
<hi>Figure,</hi> and hereunto approaching, there are a greater number than
of any other; as that which agrees with the more frequent <hi>Shape</hi> and
<hi>Fold</hi> of the <hi>Lobes</hi> and <hi>Radicle</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> as shall be seen. Yet with
some difference, as to their <hi>Shape</hi> and <hi>Surface.</hi> So, that of <hi>Lychnis Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestris</hi>
is figur'd just like the kidney of a <hi>Cat;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 73.</note> and hath a knobed <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</hi>
That of <hi>Poppey</hi> comes near it in <hi>Shape;</hi> but hath a <hi>surface</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
like that part of the <hi>Paunch</hi> of a <hi>Sheep,</hi> called the <hi>Hony-Coome.</hi>
That of great <hi>Celandine,</hi> is a little more oblong; and so, like the
Kidney, not of a <hi>Cat,</hi> but of a <hi>Sheep:</hi> chequered with parallel <hi>Rings</hi>
and other short <hi>Lines</hi> placed alternately betwixt them.</p>
                     <p>6. §. Where, by the way, we may see, as well by the <hi>Seed,</hi> as by
the other <hi>Parts,</hi> of how different kinds, the Great and Little <hi>Celan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi>
notwithstanding their Names, are to be esteemed.</p>
                     <p>7. §. The <hi>Seed</hi> also of <hi>Ben</hi> or <hi>spatling Poppey</hi> is somewhat like a
<hi>Kidney:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 73.</note> but hath its Circumference raised up into a double <hi>Ridg:</hi> to
which several small <hi>Ridges</hi> do in some sort also radiate frome one <hi>Centre
sc.</hi> the <hi>Base</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. The <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Chickweed,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 73.</note> is partly like a <hi>Kidney,</hi> and partly
like a little <hi>Retort.</hi> As also that of <hi>Pentaphil. fragiferum.</hi> But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is rough cast with small pieces having as it were feet on each side,
like little <hi>Insects.</hi> With which, the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Leuchanthem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>m</hi> (which
may be called, the <hi>Giant-Chickweed)</hi> doth much agree. The latter,
hath several <hi>Fibrous Ridges,</hi> resembling the <hi>Fibres</hi> in the <hi>Auricles</hi> of
the <hi>Heart;</hi> or runing from the nose to the Circumference, somewhat
like the <hi>Azymuth Lines</hi> on a <hi>Quadrant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. Some are <hi>Oval;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 73.</note> as that of the little <hi>Bell,</hi> and rough cast
with <hi>Fibres</hi> almost parallel and produced by the Length of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
In which latter respect, the <hi>Seeds</hi> also of <hi>Trachelium</hi> and some other like
<hi>Plants,</hi> are agreeable. That of <hi>Brooklime,</hi> is also <hi>Oval,</hi> but encompassed
with a thick <hi>Rimm,</hi> narrowing all the way to the <hi>Base</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. §. The <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Dovesfoot</hi> hath an <hi>oval Cone,</hi> and a flat <hi>Base.</hi>
Its <hi>Surface</hi> favous, like that of <hi>Poppy, Toad-flax,</hi> and some other <hi>Seeds.</hi>
That of <hi>Sedum minus aestivum luteum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 73.</note> is in a manner the <hi>Figure</hi> of
the former inverted, being flat, not at the <hi>Base,</hi> but on the <hi>Top.</hi> And
whereas that rises with a blunt <hi>Angle,</hi> this hath only a <hi>Ridg,</hi> raised
above the <hi>Surface</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. §. The <hi>Seeds</hi> of divers sorts of <hi>Grass,</hi> are more <hi>Conick,</hi> as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
of that, which for the likeness its <hi>Seed</hi> hath to a <hi>Barly Corn,</hi>
may be called <hi>Barley-Grass.</hi> And I little doubt, but that among the
several sorts of <hi>Grass,</hi> there are some which answer to all the kinds of
<hi>Esculent Grains,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 73.</note> as <hi>Oat-Grass, Rice-Grass, Wheat-Grass, Rye-Grass.</hi>
And accordingly, that they may be more profitably sown in one Ground,
than in another; and used with distinction, for the higher, or more
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100350:126"/>
wholsome feeding of Cattle. A <hi>Rush,</hi> though it seems an imperfect
<hi>Plant,</hi> yet besides its <hi>Flower,</hi> hath also a plentiful brood of <hi>Seeds</hi> of a
<hi>Conick Figure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. §. Some <hi>Seeds</hi> are <hi>Cylindrick,</hi> as that of St. <hi>Johns-wort,</hi> as
also of <hi>Tutsan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 73.</note> and some other like <hi>Plants,</hi> with some little diversity in
the <hi>Shape</hi> or <hi>Surface</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi> That of <hi>Vervain,</hi> is in a manner,
half a <hi>Cylinder:</hi> the true <hi>Seed</hi> lying in the <hi>Covers,</hi> like a Child, in a
Cradle without an head.</p>
                     <p>13. §. Others are rather <hi>Conico-Cylindrick,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 73.</note> as that of <hi>Jacobaea;</hi>
having a Coronet on the top, and several furrows by the Length round
about. Answerable to which, is that of <hi>Erygerum;</hi> in <hi>Shape</hi> not
unlike to a <hi>Rowling-pin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>14. §. Some are <hi>Plani-Conick,</hi> as that of <hi>Nettle,</hi> which is shaped
somewhat like the end of a <hi>Speer.</hi> That of <hi>Eye-bright</hi> is more <hi>Eliptick;</hi>
with several <hi>Ridges</hi> running by the Length; and joyned together with
short pieces transversly,<note place="margin">Tab. 74.</note> as in the looping of <hi>Lace.</hi> That of <hi>Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>
not very unlike a little slat <hi>Essence-Glass:</hi> in which, the <hi>Fibres</hi>
are produced by the Length, as the <hi>Ridges</hi> are in <hi>Eye-bright.</hi> And so in
<hi>Yarrow,</hi> which is also encompassed with a <hi>Membraneous Rimm.</hi> That
of <hi>Dandelyon,</hi> is <hi>Plani-Conick</hi> towards the <hi>Base.</hi> And so those of <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
Sonchus,</hi> and some others. To which, those also of <hi>Hieraceum, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gopogon,
Scorzonera,</hi> &amp;c. with respect to their <hi>Surface,</hi> do all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude.</p>
                     <p>15. §. And some are <hi>Conico-Triangular.</hi> Of which, that of <hi>Sorrel</hi>
is <hi>Conick</hi> at both ends; the sides equal; and upon every <hi>Angle,</hi>
hath a narrow and sharp <hi>Rimm.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 74.</note> As also that of <hi>Anagallis;</hi> but the
<hi>Sides</hi> are <hi>Spheri-conick,</hi> and so the ends are blunt. They are also
pounced with many little round <hi>Cavities.</hi> But have no <hi>Rimm</hi> upon
the <hi>Angles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. §. The <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Nigella</hi> is <hi>Triangular,</hi> and <hi>Conick</hi> only at the
<hi>Top.</hi> On every <hi>Angle,</hi> hath a narrow <hi>Rimm;</hi> the three <hi>Sides</hi> equal,
and <hi>Spheri-conick;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 74.</note> surrounded with seven or eight <hi>Ridges</hi> by the girth,
joyned together in some places with others transversly. That of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smart,</hi>
is also <hi>Triangular</hi> and <hi>Conick</hi> at the <hi>Top.</hi> But one of the <hi>Sides</hi>
is almost equal to the other two; which stand low. That of <hi>Knot-Grass</hi>
hath three <hi>Sides,</hi> one less than another; being as 5, 3, and 2,
or thereabout.</p>
                     <p>17. §. The next (which I take to be the <hi>Seed</hi> of a sort of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloss)</hi>
is very oddly <hi>figured.</hi> The <hi>Base, oval;</hi> the <hi>Top, conick;</hi> the
<hi>Back,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 74.</note> swelling and round as an <hi>Egg;</hi> the <hi>Belly</hi> also swelling, but rising
up into an obtuse <hi>Angle</hi> highest in the midle, somewhat like a <hi>Breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece</hi>
of <hi>Armour:</hi> and is encompassed with a <hi>Rimm</hi> sloaped upward.</p>
                     <p>18. §. That of <hi>Moldavian Bawm,</hi> is <hi>Triangular,</hi> and <hi>Conick</hi> only
at the <hi>Base.</hi> The place where it is fastned, shaped like the Beard of
a Dart.<note place="margin">Tab. 74.</note> Two of the <hi>Sides</hi> are <hi>Plani-conick,</hi> the Third <hi>Sphericonick,</hi>
and near as big as both the other two. The <hi>Head</hi> flat, with a <hi>Rimm</hi>
erected upon each <hi>Side,</hi> so as to make a <hi>Spherical Triangle.</hi> Approah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this, are those of <hi>Sage, Horehound, Clary,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>19. §. That also of <hi>Bellis Tanaceti folio,</hi> hath two <hi>Sides Planico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 74.</note>
and a third <hi>Sphericonick.</hi> The two first have several <hi>Ridges</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the <hi>Base.</hi> Which is not perfectly <hi>conick,</hi> but a little dilated
into two obtuse <hi>Angles.</hi> The <hi>Head Triangular,</hi> with one <hi>Side</hi> convex,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:100350:127"/>
the other Two straight, a little hollowd, and having a small pinacle
in the <hi>Center.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>20. §. That of <hi>Staechas Arabica,</hi> as the former, saving, that the
<hi>Head</hi> is <hi>oval,</hi> and the <hi>Base</hi> sloaped into a little <hi>Triangle.</hi> That of
<hi>Wartwort</hi> or <hi>Sun-Spurge,</hi> hath a very complex <hi>Figure.</hi> The <hi>Belly</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
of two <hi>Planiconick</hi> Sides,<note place="margin">Tab. 74.</note> as the former; the Back, <hi>Sphericonick.</hi>
The whole <hi>Seed,</hi> in a manner, <hi>Conick-oval.</hi> Yet the <hi>Base</hi> and <hi>Head</hi>
both flat. In the midle of the former, a Peg by which the <hi>Seed</hi> is
fastned; and of the latter, a poynted <hi>Knob.</hi> The midle of the <hi>Belly-Sides,</hi>
hollowed, so as to make a flat <hi>Rimm</hi> of equal <hi>Bredth;</hi> and the
hollows filled up with <hi>Bladders</hi> like those in all the <hi>Parenchymus Parts</hi>
of a <hi>Plant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>21. §. Lastly, there are some <hi>Seeds</hi> which are square. Whereof
some are straight,<note place="margin">Tab. 74.</note> as that of <hi>Fox-glove;</hi> which hath also an even <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face:</hi>
And that of <hi>Blattaria,</hi> in which there are several little hollows
in even Rows. And so in <hi>Brounwort.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>22. §. And some <hi>Convex,</hi> as that of <hi>Chrysanthemum Americ.</hi> 'Tis
<hi>Quadrati-conick,</hi> or square and sharp at the <hi>Base,</hi> and big at the
<hi>Head.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 74.</note> The <hi>Sides</hi> all plain; and a thin <hi>Rimm</hi> erected upon every <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle.</hi>
As also on the four <hi>Sides</hi> of the <hi>Head,</hi> which is flat, with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>Pinacle</hi> in the midle.</p>
                     <p>23. §. The <hi>Seed</hi> also of <hi>Tansey,</hi> is a <hi>Conick</hi> and bended square not
with the <hi>Angle</hi> forward,<note place="margin">Tab. 74.</note> as the former, but the <hi>Side.</hi> And in the
place of every <hi>Rimm,</hi> hath a round <hi>Ridge.</hi> Somewhat like to this, are
those of <hi>Febrifuga, Mayweed,</hi> and some others. Thus far of the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi>
of <hi>Seeds.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="2" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. II. Of the NUMBER and MOTIONS of Seeds.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>ATURE hath secured the <hi>Propagation</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi>
several ways, but chiefly by the <hi>Seed:</hi> for the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi>
of which, the <hi>Root, Leaves, Flower,</hi> and
<hi>Fruit,</hi> do all officiate, as hath been shewed. And
according as the <hi>Plant,</hi> or the <hi>Seed</hi> it bears, is
more liable to be destroyed, Provision is made for
<hi>Propogation,</hi> either by a greater number of <hi>Seeds,</hi>
or other ways. So the <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Strawberry,</hi> being gathered, or eaten
by <hi>Vermin,</hi> with the <hi>Fruit;</hi> the <hi>Plant</hi> is therefore easily propagated by
<hi>Trunk-Roots.</hi> So <hi>Poppy,</hi> being an annual <hi>Plant,</hi> is highly prolifick:
for instance, the <hi>White Poppy;</hi> which commonly bears about four ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>Heads,</hi> in each of which, there are at least ten <hi>Partitions,</hi> on both
sides whereof, the <hi>Seeds</hi> grow; and upon 1/4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of one side, about
100 <hi>Seeds;</hi> that is, 800 on one <hi>Partition:</hi> which being multiplied
by 10 (the number of <hi>Partitions)</hi> makes 8000; and 8000 again
by 4 (the number of <hi>Heads)</hi> makes 32000 <hi>Seeds,</hi> the yearly product
of that <hi>Plant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="199" facs="tcp:100350:127"/>
2. §. So in <hi>Typha major,</hi> the <hi>Seeds</hi> being blow'n off and low'n
(as the Eggs of many <hi>Fishes</hi> spawn'd) with great hazard, they are
strangely numerous. For as they stand altogether upon the <hi>Spike,</hi> they
make a <hi>Cylinder</hi> at least six Inches long, and near 5/8<hi rend="sup">ths</hi> of an Inch in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametre,
or an Inch and 3/4 about. Now 9 of these <hi>Seeds,</hi> set side to
side, as they stand on the <hi>Spike,</hi> make but 1/8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of an Inch; so that 72
make a line of an Inch in Length. But because upon the <hi>Spike,</hi> the
<hi>Hairs</hi> belonging to the <hi>Seeds</hi> come between them; we will abate 10,
and count but 62. To which 3/4<hi rend="sup">ths</hi> of 62, that is (without the Fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
46, being added, makes 108 for the Circuit of the <hi>Cylinder.</hi>
And the <hi>Cylinder</hi> being six Inches long, there are six times 62, that is,
372, for a Line the length of the <hi>Cylinder.</hi> Which number being
multiplied by 108, produceth 40176 the number of <hi>Seeds</hi> which stand
upon one <hi>Stalk;</hi> and so, upon three <hi>Stalks,</hi> which one <hi>Plant</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bears, there are in one year, above a hundred and twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>Seeds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. SO SOON as the <hi>Seed</hi> is ripe, Nature taketh several <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods</hi>
for its being duly sow'n: not only in the opening of the <hi>Uterus,</hi>
as in some Instances<note n="a" place="margin">P. 3. Ch. 5. Tab. 70, <hi>&amp;</hi> 71.</note> hath already been seen; but also in the make
of the <hi>Seed</hi> it self. For <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>Seeds</hi> of many <hi>Plants,</hi> which affect
a peculiar <hi>Soil</hi> or <hi>Seat,</hi> as of <hi>Arum, Poppy,</hi> &amp;c. are heavy and small
enough, without further care, to fall directly down into the Ground:
and so to grow in the same place where themselves had their <hi>Birth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. But if they are so large and light, as to be exposed to the
wind, they are often furnished with one or more <hi>Hooks;</hi> To stay them
from straying over far from their proper place, till by the fall of <hi>Leavs</hi>
or otherwise, they are safely lodged. So the <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Avens</hi> have one
single <hi>Hook,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 72.</note> those of <hi>Agrimony</hi> and <hi>Goose-grass,</hi> many; both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
loving a <hi>Bank</hi> for warmth, the latter, a <hi>Hedge</hi> for its support.</p>
                     <p>5. §. On the contrary, many <hi>Seeds</hi> are furnished with <hi>Wings</hi> or
<hi>Feathers.</hi> Partly, with the help of the Wind to carry them, when
they are ripe, from off the <hi>Plant,</hi> as those of <hi>Ash, Maple, Orach,</hi> &amp;c.
least staying thereon too long, they should either be corrupted, or
miss their season. And partly, to enable them to make their slight,
more or less, abroad: that so they may not, by falling together, come
up too thick; and that if one should miss a good <hi>Soyl</hi> or <hi>Bed,</hi> another
may hit. So the <hi>Kernels</hi> of <hi>Pine</hi> have wings not unlike to those of
some <hi>Insects;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 72.</note> yet very short, in respect of the weight of the <hi>Seed;</hi>
whereby they flye not in the <hi>Aer,</hi> but like domestick <hi>Fowls,</hi> only
flutter upon the Ground. But those of <hi>Typha, Dandelion</hi> and most
of the <hi>Pappous</hi> kind, with many more, have very long and numerous
<hi>Feathers,</hi> by which they are wafted every way, and to any distance
necessary for the aforesaid purposes.</p>
                     <p>6. §. Again, there are some <hi>Seeds,</hi> which are scattered not by
flying abroad, but by being either <hi>Spurted,</hi> or <hi>Slung</hi> away. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> The first
are those of <hi>Woodsorrel;</hi> which having a running <hi>Root,</hi> Nature sees it fit
to sow the <hi>Seeds</hi> at some distance. The doing of which is effected by
a white thick and sturdy <hi>Cover</hi> of a <hi>Tendinous</hi> or <hi>Springy Nature,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 72.</note> in
which the <hi>Seed</hi> lies within the <hi>Case.</hi> This <hi>Cover,</hi> so soon as it begins
to drye, bursts open on one side, in an instant, and is violently turned
inside outward, as you would turn the <hi>Gizard</hi> of a <hi>Fowl;</hi> and so
smartly throws off the <hi>Seed.</hi>

7. §. The <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Harts-tongue,</hi> and of all that <hi>Tribe,</hi> are <hi>Slung</hi> or
<hi>Shot</hi> away. The doing of which is performed by the curious contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of the <hi>Seed-Case;</hi> as in <hi>Codded Arsmart,</hi> and some other like
<hi>Plants.</hi> Only there, the <hi>Spring</hi> moves and curles up inward; but here
it moves outward. I shall describe it, as well as the <hi>Weather</hi> (which
when I observed it was cloudy) would permit. Every <hi>Seed-Case,</hi> as
it appears through a good <hi>Glass,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 72.</note> stands upon a <hi>Pedicle</hi> from 1/2 an Inch
to an Inch or more in Length; at the bottom about as thick again as a
<hi>Horse-hair,</hi> and a little thicker at the <hi>Top,</hi> on which stands the <hi>Case,</hi> of
a <hi>Silver Colour;</hi> about the bigness of a <hi>Cherry-stone,</hi> of a <hi>Spherick Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,</hi>
and girded about with a sturdy <hi>Tendon</hi> or <hi>Spring,</hi> of the
<hi>Colour</hi> of <hi>Gold:</hi> the whole <hi>Machine</hi> looking not much unlike a little
<hi>Padlock.</hi> The <hi>Surface</hi> of the <hi>Spring</hi> resembles a fine <hi>Screw,</hi> or some of
the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Wood</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi> So soon as by the <hi>Innate Aer</hi> of
the <hi>Plant,</hi> or otherwise, this <hi>Spring</hi> is become stark enough, it sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
breaks the <hi>Case</hi> into two halfs, like two little <hi>Cups,</hi> and so slings
the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. These <hi>Cases</hi> grow in oblique <hi>Furrows</hi> or <hi>Trenches</hi> on the back
side the <hi>Leaf,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 72.</note> from 1/4 of an Inch to an Inch in Length, and about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

300 of the <hi>Cases</hi> above described; and allowing but 10 <hi>Seeds</hi> to every

<hi>Furrows</hi> in one <hi>Leaf,</hi> with allowance for the lesser <hi>Furrows;</hi> and that

to the Growth of the <hi>Seed</hi> when it is sow'n. For
which purpose, the outer <hi>Covers</hi> are somewhere
furnished with <hi>Apertures</hi> sufficient for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Alimental Moyster</hi> from the <hi>Ground;</hi> and
<hi>Divisions,</hi> for the <hi>shooting forth</hi> of the young
<hi>Root</hi> into it. As in the <hi>Seed</hi> of a <hi>Gourd,</hi> at the
<hi>Bottom;</hi> in a <hi>Bean,</hi> on the <hi>Side;</hi> and in a <hi>Ches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut,</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Tab. 72.</note> in which places the <hi>Radicle</hi> or young <hi>Root</hi> always
lies and puts forth, in the said several <hi>Seeds.</hi> And the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Palma

a double <hi>Aperture.</hi> Not much unlike to this, is that found sometimes
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100350:128"/>
in larger parcels of <hi>Euphorbium;</hi> for which <hi>Cause,</hi> I suspect it to be the
<hi>Gumm</hi> of a <hi>Plant</hi> of the <hi>Tithymal</hi> kind.</p>
                     <p>2. §. If the <hi>Cover</hi> of the <hi>Seed</hi> be stony and very hard, it is also
distinguished into several <hi>Pieces;</hi> whereby they easily cleave asunder
without much resistance to the eruption of the <hi>Root.</hi> So the <hi>Shell</hi> of a
<hi>Hazel-nut</hi> easily cleavs on the edg; and the cleft begins best at the
poynt,<note place="margin">Tab. 75.</note> where the <hi>Root</hi> stands and shoots forth. The <hi>Shell</hi> of some
<hi>Walnuts</hi> cleavs into three <hi>Parts;</hi> and the <hi>Stone</hi> of the <hi>Bellerick Myro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balan</hi>
into five: that so, being very thick and hard, if one piece should
not yield, another may not fail to do it. And the <hi>Covers</hi> or <hi>Husks</hi> of
some sorts of <hi>Grain,</hi> as of <hi>Millet,</hi> are only folded or laped one over
another, the better to give way to their tender <hi>Sprouts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. Besides the <hi>Kernels</hi> of <hi>Plums</hi> and some other <hi>Fruits,</hi> there
are very many <hi>Seeds,</hi> even of the smaller sort, which have also stony
<hi>Covers;</hi> as of <hi>Carthamum, Myagrum monospermon, Beet, Borage,
Lithosperme, Amaranthus, Violet,</hi> &amp;c. Sometimes, for the reception of
the harsher and less matured <hi>Principles</hi> from the <hi>Seed,</hi> in its <hi>Generation,</hi>
as in <hi>Borage.</hi> Commonly, to keep it warmer before and after its sow'n.
For which purpose, the outer <hi>Covers</hi> of some <hi>Seeds,</hi> are as it were
Lined with <hi>Fur:</hi> in that of <hi>Great Maple,</hi> Short; of <hi>Gossipium,</hi> Long.
And if the <hi>Seed</hi> requires a longer stay under ground, the hardness of
the <hi>Cover</hi> serves to stint the <hi>Aliment;</hi> lest too much, should either rot
it, or cause it to germinate, before its proper season, or full time for a
more <hi>Masculine</hi> Growth.</p>
                     <p>4. §. On the contrary, many <hi>Seeds,</hi> as those of <hi>Clary, Garden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Cress,</hi> and others of that <hi>Tribe,</hi> have their upper <hi>Covers</hi> faced with a

gradually swells, till it lies like a <hi>Gelly</hi> round about the <hi>Seed.</hi> Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a more plentiful supply of <hi>Aliment;</hi> or at least, to soften the
<hi>Covers,</hi> the better to accelerate the Growth of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. The process of Nature in the several steps of the <hi>Vegetation</hi>
of the <hi>Seed,</hi> hath formerly been explained.<note n="a" place="margin">B. 1. Ch. 1.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. THE COVERS of all, or at least the far greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Seeds,</hi> are Three; some way or other derived from the <hi>Pith:</hi>
as shall hereafter be seen. And sometimes, Four: even those of ston'd
<hi>Fruits,</hi> have Three, besides the <hi>Stone.</hi> In that of <hi>Gossipium,</hi> there are
Two <hi>Coats</hi> under that lined with the <hi>Cotton.</hi> The <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Cucumer,
Goats-beard,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 75.</note> 
                        <hi>Broom, Scabious, Lettice,</hi> &amp;c. although so small, have
plainly Three <hi>Coats.</hi> But in some of these, and many more, there are
only Two distinctly visible, except in the State of <hi>Generation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. In the Upper <hi>Coat,</hi> the <hi>Seed-Vessels</hi> are disseminated. The
Second, is first a meer <hi>Pulp;</hi> but afterwards shrinks up and sticks close
to the upper. The Third or Inmost is more dense; and if it be thin,
for the most part,<note place="margin">Tab. 76.</note> transparent; whereby the <hi>Seed</hi> seems sometimes to
be naked while it lies therein; as in <hi>Almonds, Cucumers,</hi> and the like.
For this sticks not to the midle <hi>Coat,</hi> as that doth to the outer; but
commonly, remains entire, after those are stripp'd off, being as it were,
the <hi>Smock</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. In <hi>Melissa</hi> and some other small <hi>Seeds,</hi> it comes finely off up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
soaking in warm Water or on the <hi>Tongue.</hi> In <hi>Fenugreek,</hi> 'tis soft,
and of an <hi>Amber-Colour;</hi> and being moystened, looks almost like fine
<hi>Glew.</hi> But commonly, tis a prety tough <hi>Membrane,</hi> and often with
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100350:129"/>
some thickness, as in <hi>Plums, Borage, Scabious.</hi> Yet always extream
thin at the <hi>Tip</hi> of the <hi>Radicle;</hi> the more easily to break and yield to
it, as the <hi>Secundine</hi> to the <hi>Foetus,</hi> when it first shoots into the Ground.
And sometimes, as in the <hi>Seeds</hi> of an <hi>Orange,</hi> it hath at one end, the
resemblance of a <hi>Placenta.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 75.</note> But of this, and the two upper <hi>Coats,</hi> I
shall give a further Description in the last <hi>Chapter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. AS ALL <hi>Seeds</hi> are <hi>ex Ovo;</hi> so there are many with thin
<hi>Covers,</hi> as of <hi>Orach, Spinage, Beet,</hi> and the rest of that <hi>Tribe,</hi> &amp;c.
which besides the <hi>Albumen</hi> or clear <hi>Liquor</hi> out of which they are bred;
have also, a <hi>Vitellum,</hi> or a <hi>Body</hi> thereunto <hi>Analogus:</hi> being neither part
of the <hi>Seed,</hi> nor part of the <hi>Covers,</hi> but distinct from them both. With
respect to the <hi>Bulk</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> very large, as white as <hi>Starch,</hi> and pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
friable,<note place="margin">Tab. 75.</note> like good <hi>Rice</hi> or <hi>Barley:</hi> of a roundish <hi>Figure,</hi> and grooved
on the <hi>Girth,</hi> so as to have a double <hi>Edge;</hi> Whereby the <hi>Seed,</hi> which
is long and slender, lies round it, as a <hi>Sack</hi> of <hi>Corn</hi> upon a <hi>Pack-Saddle</hi>
or a <hi>Rope</hi> upon a <hi>Pully-wheel.</hi> Upon my first notice hereof, it seemed
to answer to a <hi>Placenta.</hi> But upon further consideration, the <hi>Analogy</hi>
doth not hold betwixt them. For the <hi>Placenta</hi> lies without the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes</hi>
in which the <hi>Foetus</hi> is conteined: whereas this body lies within
the <hi>Covers</hi> contiguous to the <hi>Seed,</hi> and so becomes its first and finest <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment,</hi>
as the <hi>Yelk</hi> doth to the <hi>Chick.</hi> For which purpose, as in the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi>
of the <hi>Seed,</hi> it is a pure <hi>Milky Chyle;</hi> So in its <hi>Vegetation,</hi> it is
converted into the like again.</p>
                     <p>10. §. The same Body for Sustance, is observable in the <hi>Seeds</hi> of
<hi>Rhapontick,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 75.</note> 
                        <hi>Dock, Sorrel,</hi> and the rest of that kindred, with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
That whereas in <hi>Orach,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Seed</hi> only lies upon it; here,
the main <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Lobes</hi> of the <hi>Seed</hi> are immersed therein, the <hi>Radicle</hi>
standing naked or above it. So that the said <hi>Lobes,</hi> and therein the
<hi>Seminal-Root</hi> are beded herein, as in a <hi>Tub</hi> of <hi>Meal</hi> or a little pot of pure
refin'd <hi>Mould,</hi> necessary for the first <hi>Vegetation</hi> of the <hi>Radicle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. §. BY THESE midle <hi>Steps, Nature</hi> proceeds from the
<hi>Thiner Covers</hi> of <hi>Seeds;</hi> or those, which after the <hi>Generation</hi> of the
<hi>Seed</hi> is finished, shrink up; to the <hi>Bulky Kind,</hi> or those which keep
their <hi>Bulk</hi> after they are dry. Wherein, not only the <hi>Lobes,</hi> as in
<hi>Dock,</hi> but the whole <hi>Seed</hi> is immediately lodged. Different in <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
Shape</hi> and <hi>Bulk;</hi> but always many times biger than the true <hi>Seed</hi>
within it: for which it is commonly mistaken; but is no more the <hi>Seed,</hi>
than is the <hi>Stone</hi> of a <hi>Plum,</hi> the <hi>Kernel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. §. In the <hi>Barbado Nut,</hi> 'tis <hi>White, Soft, Conick-oval,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
all its <hi>Dimentions,</hi> 8 or 10 times bigger than the <hi>Seed</hi> within it.
In <hi>Ashen Keys,</hi> 'tis of a sad <hi>Colour, hard,</hi> yet somewhat <hi>Oyly, Oval</hi> and
<hi>flat,</hi> and of the same <hi>Bigness</hi> as in the <hi>Barbado Nut,</hi> with respect to the
<hi>Seed.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 76.</note> In the <hi>Fruit</hi> commonly called <hi>Nux Vomica Officinarum,</hi> 'tis of
the <hi>Colour</hi> and <hi>Hardness</hi> of a <hi>Cows-Horne;</hi> and makes almost the whole
<hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> being about 14 or 15 times the <hi>Bulk</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
In <hi>Goosgrass</hi> or <hi>Cliver</hi> 'tis of the like <hi>Horny Substance,</hi> but shaped some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
like a <hi>Bonet</hi> with the <hi>Rimm</hi> tuckt in.<note place="margin">Tab. 77.</note> And so in a <hi>Coffee-Berry;</hi> but

through the Length, where the two <hi>Ends</hi> meet. With other diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
which will best be understood, when I come presently to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi>
of the <hi>Seed</hi> herein contained.</p>

13. §. With respect to the use of this <hi>Cover,</hi> it is observable, that
where there is a <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Shell</hi> over it, as in the <hi>Barbado Nut,</hi> it is
<hi>soft;</hi> but where there is none, as in <hi>Nux Vomica, Ash,</hi> &amp;c. 'tis hard;
and so it self instead of a <hi>Stone.</hi> As also, That it becomes <hi>hard,</hi> only
by the proper Nature of its <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> and the exquisite <hi>smallness</hi> of
the <hi>Bladders</hi> of which it consists. Whereas a <hi>Stone,</hi> is also hardened by
the <hi>Less</hi> or <hi>Tartar</hi> of the <hi>Sap</hi> which sinks into it, and thereby <hi>petrifies</hi> it
<note n="a" place="margin">P. 3. Ch. 3.</note> as hath been said. So that whereas a <hi>Stone,</hi> as it lies in the <hi>Ground,</hi>
only cleavs in certain Places, but continues hard: This <hi>Cover,</hi> like some
<hi>Horns,</hi> upon the due accession of <hi>Moisture,</hi> doth gradually become
<hi>soft.</hi> Whereby, as while it is <hi>hard,</hi> it performs the Office of a <hi>Stone,</hi>
in guarding the <hi>Seed</hi> til the proper <hi>Season</hi> for its <hi>Growth:</hi> So after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
when it is <hi>soft,</hi> it answers, as in <hi>Orach</hi> or <hi>Dock,</hi>

<hi>Parts,</hi> which become the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Stalk,</hi> are so: The <hi>Main Body</hi>
being of a different Substance; when the <hi>Corn</hi> is ripe, <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>friable;</hi>
but when it is sown, easily <hi>colliquable</hi> into a kind of <hi>Milk</hi> or <hi>Chyle,</hi> so
that, in some respects, it hath a near <hi>Analogy</hi> to a <hi>Vitellum.</hi> For as that
is gradually melted into a sort of <hi>Chyle,</hi> and by the <hi>Branches</hi> of the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus
Intestinalis</hi> carryed into the <hi>Bowels</hi> of the <hi>Chick:</hi> So is this, into a
like <hi>Substance,</hi> and by the <hi>Branches</hi> of the <hi>Seminal Root</hi> (formerly
describ'd) conveyed to those <hi>Parts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">B. 1. Ch. 1.</note> which become the future Plant.</p>
                     <p>3. §. Of Relation to this Kind, the <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Dates,</hi> and of some
other like <hi>Plants,</hi> may be esteem'd. For that which is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Stone,</hi> seems indeed to be the <hi>Main Body</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> doubled
or folded up in the same manner as in <hi>Corn.</hi> To which that <hi>Part</hi> which
becomes the <hi>Plant,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 75.</note> is annexed. But whereas in <hi>Corn,</hi> 'tis placed at
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100350:130"/>
the Bottom of the <hi>Main Body;</hi> here it lies in a small round <hi>Cavity</hi> in
the middle of the <hi>Back.</hi> The <hi>Stone,</hi> or <hi>Main Body,</hi> where this Part
grows to it, is not so hard, as more remote from it: and is therefore
probably in some part dissolved, by lying in the <hi>Ground,</hi> as in
<hi>Corn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. But for the most part, the <hi>Main Body</hi> is divided, as hath been
said, into two <hi>Lobes;</hi> and those in Substance <hi>Homogeneous</hi> to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Part</hi> or <hi>Parts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 75.</note> plainly distinguished in most <hi>Kernels</hi> and other
large <hi>Seeds;</hi> and not difficultly in many lesser ones, as in that of <hi>Viola
Lunaris, Scabious, Doves-Foot,</hi> &amp;c. if slipped out of their <hi>Covers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are full ripe.</p>
                     <p>5. §. In <hi>Hounds-Tongue,</hi> they are of a circular figure, and very large in
Proportion to the <hi>Radicle.</hi> In <hi>Cucumer,</hi> oblong, with some visible
<hi>Branches</hi> of the <hi>Seminal Root;</hi> and the <hi>Radicle</hi> somewhat bigger. But
in <hi>Scorzonera,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 75.</note> very long, like the Leggs of a Pair of <hi>Compasses:</hi> and
the two first, or <hi>dissimular Leavs</hi> of the <hi>Plant</hi> into which they are
converted, are of the same <hi>Shape.</hi> Of these and many more, the
<hi>Radicle</hi> is short and pointed; and lies in one straight Line with the
<hi>Lobes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. In <hi>Viola Lunaria,</hi> they are very large; and the <hi>Branches</hi> of
the <hi>Seminal Root,</hi> fairly apparent, so as to resemble a Pair of <hi>Leavs.</hi>
The <hi>Radicle</hi> pretty long, equally thick from end to end, and couched
down upon the two <hi>Lobes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 75.</note> each of them having a little <hi>Shoulder</hi> for it
to lie upon. In <hi>Woad,</hi> where it hath the like <hi>Posture</hi> and <hi>Shape,</hi> as also
in <hi>Chamaelina, Eruca,</hi> and many others, it is very <hi>Bulky,</hi> being bigger
than both the <hi>Lobes</hi> put together.</p>
                     <p>7. §. Of this Part, I think it may be observed, That commonly those
<hi>Seeds,</hi> wherein it is very small with respect to the <hi>Lobes,</hi> produce a
<hi>Perennial</hi> Plant: And so, <hi>vice versa,</hi> where it is very large, an <hi>Annual</hi>
one. In the latter, the <hi>Seminal Virtue</hi> being more vigorous, and so
tending more hastily to the Business of <hi>Generation,</hi> followed with the
<hi>Death</hi> of the Plant.</p>
                     <p>8. §. IN THE former <hi>Seeds,</hi> the <hi>Lobes</hi> lie flat one against another.
But in <hi>Garden-Radish,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 75.</note> they are folded up, so as to receive the <hi>Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
into their <hi>Bosome:</hi> as when a <hi>Chicken</hi> tucks his Head under his
Wing.</p>
                     <p>9. §. In <hi>Holyoak,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 75.</note> the <hi>Lobes</hi> are plated upwards, and re-plated
down again. Being most agreeably composed to the <hi>Shape</hi> of the
<hi>Covers,</hi> as those are to their <hi>Posture</hi> on the Plant. In <hi>Maple,</hi> they are
plated one over another, and so rouled up.</p>
                     <p>10. §. In the <hi>Cotton-Seed,</hi> which consisteth almost wholly of two very
broad and thin <hi>Lobes</hi> or <hi>Leaves,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 75.</note> the <hi>Folds</hi> are yet more numerous; all
curiously reduced to an exact and solid <hi>Oval.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. §. It happens now and then, that instead of two, there are
three <hi>Lobes,</hi> as in the <hi>Kernels</hi> of <hi>Plums, Apples,</hi> and other <hi>Fruits,</hi> and
the smaller sorts of <hi>Seeds,</hi> will spring up sometimes with more than
two <hi>dissimilar Leaves,</hi> originally the <hi>Lobes</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi> These are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by some, more frequently to produce a double <hi>Flower,</hi> which
may be, because the <hi>seminal Virtue</hi> in such <hi>Seeds,</hi> is increased by a third
Part.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="205" facs="tcp:100350:130"/>
12. §. IN many <hi>Seeds,</hi> the <hi>Radicle</hi> is of one and the same <hi>Colour</hi>
from end to end. But in others, as in the <hi>Lupine,</hi> it is observable,
That the upper and greater hald, is <hi>White;</hi> the Lower to the <hi>Point,</hi> hath
a kind of <hi>Horny Gloss,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 75.</note> and seems to be of a somewhat different make.
Whereby it comes to pass, that after the <hi>Radicle</hi> is shot forth a little
way, only this lower half descends and becomes the <hi>Root:</hi> The upper
half is produced or raised above ground, as a <hi>Pillar</hi> upon which the
<hi>Lobes,</hi> or <hi>dissimilar Leaves</hi> are erected.</p>
                     <p>13. §. This <hi>Seed,</hi> on the out side of each <hi>Lobe,</hi> and near the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicle,</hi>
hath a very small and round <hi>Node,</hi> like a <hi>Navel;</hi> whereof, in the
first Book:<note place="margin">Ch. 7.</note> the whole <hi>Seed</hi> looking not much unlike a <hi>Pidgeons Head;</hi>
the <hi>Radicle</hi> resembling the <hi>Bill,</hi> and the <hi>Navel</hi> the <hi>Eye.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>14. §. IN the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Garden-Orach,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 75.</note> both the <hi>Radicle</hi> and <hi>Lobes</hi>
are very long and slender, and lie almost in a compleat Circle round
about the <hi>Vitellum</hi> before describ'd. The <hi>Lobes</hi> of <hi>Rhapontick</hi> are
shaped like the <hi>Bitt</hi> of a <hi>Spade;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ch. 3.</note> and the <hi>Radicle</hi> stands erected above
them like the <hi>Handle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>15. §. OF SEEDS also with the <hi>Bulky Cover,</hi> there are many not
divided into <hi>Lobes;</hi> being in a manner, all one <hi>Piece;</hi> as all of the
<hi>Bulbous-Kind.</hi> In some of which, though the inmost <hi>Cover</hi> be thin;
yet compared either with the other <hi>Covers,</hi> or with the <hi>Seed</hi> it self, it
may very well be accounted of the <hi>Bulky-Kind.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. §. In <hi>Flag,</hi> it is above twenty times bigger than the <hi>Seed</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it. Consisting of <hi>Bladders</hi> all <hi>Radiated</hi> towards the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
The <hi>Seed</hi> it self is shaped somewhat like a <hi>Penknife.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 76.</note> The lower Part
which becoms the <hi>Bulb,</hi> as the <hi>Haft,</hi> is thick, and cometh near to a
<hi>Cylindrick</hi> Figure, and the end, round. The upper Part which becomes
the first years <hi>Leaf,</hi> as the <hi>Blade,</hi> is rather flat, double edged, and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the Point a little bent. The <hi>Fibers</hi> and <hi>Bladders</hi> of which
it consists, are all disposed into Parallel Lines running by the length.
In <hi>Lily,</hi> where this <hi>Cover</hi> is thinner and more <hi>Transparent,</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cut, but only held up against the Light, the <hi>Seed</hi> may be seen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it.</p>
                     <p>17. §. BUT THE greater number of <hi>Seeds</hi> also with the <hi>Bulky
Cover,</hi> are divided into two <hi>Lobes;</hi> which, for the most part, resemble
a pair of little <hi>Leavs.</hi> In the <hi>Purging Nut</hi> of <hi>Angola,</hi> the <hi>Shell</hi> being
taken off,<note place="margin">Tab. 76.</note> the upper <hi>Covers</hi> (dry'd and shrunk up) seem to be but one.
In these, the <hi>Spermatick Vessels</hi> are Branched. Under these, lies the
Thick and Inmost <hi>Cover;</hi> which being cut down the middle, exhibits
the true <hi>Seed:</hi> Consisting of a couple of fair <hi>Leavs,</hi> Veined, and as
white as <hi>Milk,</hi> joyned together with the <hi>Radicle</hi> at their <hi>Base;</hi> and
let into a Hollow, made in the <hi>Cover,</hi> of an answerable shape. The
like is observable in the <hi>Barbado-Nut, Ricinus Americanus,</hi> and some
other <hi>Indian Fruits;</hi> with some little difference in the Shape of the
<hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Leavs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>18. §. IN the foregoing <hi>Fruits,</hi> the <hi>Bulky Cover</hi> is very soft.
But in the <hi>Nux Vomica Officinarum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 76.</note> 'tis near as hard as a <hi>Date-stone.</hi>
In this, besides the hollow made for the reception of the <hi>Seed,</hi> or the
two <hi>Leavs</hi> and <hi>Root;</hi> the <hi>Sides</hi> are separated or distinct almost to the
<hi>Edge</hi> of the <hi>Cover</hi> round about, especially towards the <hi>Root:</hi> So that
it may not unaptly be compared to a little <hi>Pouch</hi> with the <hi>Sides</hi> clapt
together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="206" facs="tcp:100350:131"/>
19. §. IN this and the <hi>Nuts</hi> above mentioned, the <hi>Seeds</hi> are all very
large. But in some other <hi>Plants,</hi> they are extream small, so as to be
hardly visible without a <hi>Glass;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 77.</note> as in <hi>Staphisagria, Peony,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisagria,</hi>
the <hi>Thick</hi> or <hi>Inmost Cover,</hi> is commonly a <hi>Spherical Triangle,
conick</hi> towards the <hi>Base.</hi> At the poynt of which, there is a little <hi>Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
in which the <hi>Seed,</hi> about as big as a small pins head, is lodged. The
<hi>Root</hi> whereof is a little poynted, and the two <hi>Lobes</hi> rounded at the
<hi>Top.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>20. §. In <hi>Peony,</hi> the same <hi>Cover</hi> is <hi>Soft, White,</hi> and of an <hi>Oval Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure;</hi>
the part used in <hi>Medicine.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 77.</note> Usually thought to be the <hi>Seed</hi> it
self. But is near two hundred times biger than the true <hi>Seed,</hi> which is
almost invisible. It lies in a little <hi>Cavity</hi> near the bottom of the <hi>Cover;</hi>
with a thick and blunt <hi>Root,</hi> and two poynted <hi>Lobes</hi> or <hi>Leavs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>23. §. IN the <hi>Coffee-Berry,</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> lies in the <hi>Inner</hi> or <hi>Cartilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Cover</hi> (formerly described) where one would not expect to find
it,<note place="margin">Ch. 3. Tab. 77.</note> 
                        <hi>sc.</hi> near the <hi>Top</hi> or <hi>Surface</hi> of the <hi>Back.</hi> The <hi>Lobes</hi> of the <hi>Seed</hi> are
veined like two very minute <hi>Leaves,</hi> and joyned to a long <hi>Root</hi> like a
<hi>Stalk.</hi> The end of which comes just to the bottom of the <hi>Cover,</hi> ready
for its <hi>exit</hi> into the <hi>Ground.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>22. §. In <hi>Goosgrass,</hi> where the <hi>Inner Cover</hi> is also <hi>Cartilaginous</hi> or
<hi>Horney,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 77.</note> the <hi>Seed</hi> is postured in much a like manner, and looks just like
a couple of poynted <hi>Leavs</hi> with a very long <hi>Stalk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>23. §. THE <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Stramonium,</hi> is also inclosed in a <hi>Bulky Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
Which being soaked in warm water, and very warily cut about
the edges,<note place="margin">Tab. 77.</note> with a <hi>Rasor,</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> may be taken out of it entire. Shaped
like that of <hi>Orach,</hi> but much longer. For the <hi>Reception</hi> whereof, the
<hi>Cover</hi> is formed with a hollow, which runs round about it near the
<hi>Edge;</hi> where in the <hi>Seed</hi> lies like a little winding <hi>Snake.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>ROM between the two <hi>Lobes,</hi> rises up the <hi>Stalk</hi> of

the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. In many <hi>Plants, Nature</hi> sees fit only to lay
the foundation hereof in a small round <hi>Node;</hi> where
upon the <hi>Leavs,</hi> in the <hi>Vegetation</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> are
superstructed: as in <hi>Viola Lunaria,</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>3. §. But in the greater number of <hi>Seeds,</hi> is formed a true <hi>Bud,</hi>
consisting of perfect <hi>Leavs;</hi> different from those, which grow upon
the <hi>Stalk,</hi> only in <hi>Bigness;</hi> and so far in <hi>Shape,</hi> as the same <hi>Parts</hi> of an
Animal <hi>Foetus,</hi> in its several ages in the <hi>Womb.</hi> In many <hi>Seeds,</hi> as well
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100350:131"/>
small as great, and as well of <hi>Herbs</hi> as <hi>Trees,</hi> it is very apparent. But
oftentimes lyeth so deep between the <hi>Lobes</hi> as to be almost undiscerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as in <hi>Maple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. The <hi>Leaves</hi> of the <hi>Bud,</hi> in different <hi>Plants,</hi> are of a different
<hi>Number;</hi> in some, Two; in others, Four, Six, and sometimes more.
In the <hi>Bay-Berry,</hi> they are only two; very small, but thick or fat,

Two; almost invisible; broad at the <hi>Bottom,</hi> poynted at the <hi>Top,</hi>
thick or fat, yet plated inward, and postured a little distant one from
the other; for the two next to rise up betwen them. The like may
be seen in <hi>Carthamum;</hi> and so, I suppose, in all the <hi>Carduus Kind.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. In some <hi>Herbs,</hi> although the <hi>Bud</hi> consisteth but of two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Leaves,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 78.</note> yet they are very conspicuous. Not only in larger <hi>Seeds,</hi>
as in the <hi>Phaseolus</hi> or <hi>French Bean;</hi> but in those which are small, as
in the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Hemp.</hi> In this, the two <hi>Leaves</hi> are both plated, and
so set <hi>Edge</hi> to <hi>Edge,</hi> with mutual <hi>Undulations.</hi> Of that Length, as
to be extended beyond a third part of the <hi>Lobes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. In the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Sena,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 78.</note> the <hi>Bud</hi> consisteth of Four <hi>Leaves;</hi> of
which, the greater pair is the outer, and guards the less. Shaped not
much unlike those in the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Carduus;</hi> but are a little more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
                     <p>7. §. In the <hi>Bud</hi> of an <hi>Almond,</hi> we may easily count six, or eight
<hi>Leaves,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 78.</note> and sometimes more; the Inermost being laid bare by a dexterous
<hi>Separation</hi> of the Outer. These are by much the greatest, doubled In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and so laped one over another; whereby they embosome all
the rest, as a <hi>Hen</hi> spreads her <hi>Wings</hi> over her <hi>Chickens.</hi> The like is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
in many other large <hi>Kernels,</hi> as also in the <hi>Garden Bean,</hi> and
some other <hi>Plants.</hi> With respect to which, I have taken leave<note n="a" place="margin">B. 1. Ch. 1.</note> to
call this <hi>Part</hi> the <hi>Plume.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. THE LOBES of the <hi>Seed,</hi> and so likewise the <hi>Radicle</hi>
and <hi>Bud</hi> consist of a <hi>Skin, Parenchyma,</hi> and <hi>Branched Vessels:</hi> all which
I have formerly described.<note n="b" place="margin">B. 1. Ch. 1.</note> I shall now add the following <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. And first of the <hi>Skin,</hi> which in some <hi>Seeds,</hi> as the <hi>French-Bean</hi>
may easily be separated from the <hi>Parenchyma:</hi> especially if the
<hi>Bean</hi> be soaked in water for some days; for then it will slip off, like
the <hi>Skin</hi> in any part of ones <hi>Body</hi> where it is blistered. 'Tis woven
into <hi>Bladders,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 79.</note> as the <hi>Parenchyma;</hi> but into smaller ones, and upon the
<hi>Lobes</hi> of a <hi>Garden Bean,</hi> all radiated towards the <hi>Center.</hi> With
these <hi>Bladders,</hi> there are also mixed a sort of <hi>Lignous Fibres,</hi> incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
small, which give a <hi>Toughness</hi> to the <hi>Skin,</hi> and by which the
<hi>Bladders</hi> are directed into <hi>Rays.</hi>

                     <p>10. §. The <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> as is said, are much larger
than those of the <hi>Skin,</hi> especially in the <hi>Lobes.</hi> In those of a <hi>Garden
Bean,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>11. §. Throughout the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> run the <hi>Branched Vessels,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 79.</note> which
in the <hi>Lobes</hi> make the <hi>Seminal Root;</hi> in the <hi>Radicle</hi> and <hi>Plume,</hi> the <hi>Wood</hi>

12. §. I shall here further note, That the utmost divisions are no
where extended to the Circumference of the <hi>Lobes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 79.</note> but are all inos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
together at a considerable distance from it, as in the <hi>Leaves</hi> of
some <hi>Plants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13. §. In the <hi>Lobes</hi> they all meet in one solid <hi>Nerve.</hi> But in the
<hi>Radicle,</hi> are dilated into a hollow <hi>Trunk,</hi> filled up with a <hi>Pith;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of <hi>Bladders</hi> somewhat bigger than those which make,<note place="margin">Tab. 79.</note> as it were,
the <hi>Barque</hi> of the <hi>Radicle.</hi> In the <hi>Radicle</hi> of a <hi>French Bean,</hi> the <hi>Pith</hi>
is very conspicuous.</p>
                     <p>14. §. The <hi>Vessels</hi> are of two kinds, as in the other <hi>Parts</hi> of a
<hi>Plant;</hi> for <hi>Sap,</hi> and for <hi>Aer.</hi> Not running collateral, as <hi>Arteries</hi> and
<hi>Veins;</hi> but the latter every where sheathed in the former. From the
<hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> it is, that if a <hi>Bean</hi> be steeped in water, and then the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicle</hi>
cut transversly and pressed, it will yield <hi>Bubles</hi> as well as <hi>Liquor.</hi>
These <hi>Vessels</hi> are admirably small, yet through a very good <hi>Glass</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
visible.<note place="margin">Tab. 79.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>15. §. The <hi>Liquor</hi> conteined in the <hi>Seed,</hi> when full ripe is chiefly
<hi>Oyl;</hi> generally, found in a greater proportion here, than in any other
part of a <hi>Plant.</hi> Being as the <hi>Pickle,</hi> in which the <hi>Seminal Virtues,
i. e.</hi> the more <hi>volatile</hi> and <hi>active Principles</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> are immersed
for their <hi>Preservation:</hi> and to curb them from too great a <hi>Luxuriance</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. VI. Of the GENERATION of the SEED.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I made choice of a <hi>Garden-Bean,</hi> to shew the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the <hi>Vegetation</hi> of the <hi>Seed:</hi> so I shall take
an <hi>Aprecock,</hi> as very apt and convenient, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and represent the <hi>Method</hi> which <hi>Nature</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in its <hi>Generation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. In order to this, the first thing that is to
be done, is to make a fit <hi>Uterus.</hi> Both to keep
the <hi>Membranes</hi> of the <hi>Foetus</hi> warm, and succulent,
till it be formed: and to preserve and secure the <hi>Foetus</hi> it self after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
till it comes to be born into the <hi>Ground.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. For this purpose, the <hi>Pulp</hi> and <hi>Stone</hi> of the <hi>Fruit</hi> are both
necessary; but primarily the <hi>Stone:</hi> the <hi>Meat</hi> or <hi>Pulp</hi> being no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
necessary, but because the <hi>Stone</hi> cannot be made without it; the
petrifying of that <hi>Parenchyma</hi> which is the <hi>Ground</hi> of the <hi>Stone,</hi> being
effected, by the sinking of the <hi>Tartar</hi> from the <hi>Pulp</hi> thereinto.</p>
                     <p>4. §. And that, at the first, the <hi>Ground</hi> of the <hi>Stone,</hi> is a distinct,
but soft <hi>Parenchyma;</hi> is evident in the cuting of a young <hi>Aprecock.</hi>
Of which, also a slice cut off, with a <hi>Rasor,</hi> and viewed through a
good <hi>Glass,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 82.</note> sheweth it to be composed of <hi>Bladders,</hi> as the <hi>Pulp</hi> it
self. Only, whereas many of those of the <hi>Pulp</hi> are large, now about
as big as a white <hi>Pepper-Corn:</hi> these are no bigger than a <hi>Mustard-Seed.</hi>
But as the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> hardens into a <hi>Stone,</hi> these <hi>Bladders</hi>
are all gradually filled up, and disappear.</p>
                     <p>5. §. This <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is derived immediately from the <hi>Pith,</hi> as the
<hi>Pulp</hi> is from the <hi>Barque;</hi> and makes the far greater part of the <hi>Stone.</hi>
'Tis covered all over within, with a very thin <hi>Lining;</hi> derived, not from
the <hi>Pith</hi> but the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> which covers the <hi>Seed-Branch,</hi> upon its first
entrance within the hollow of the <hi>Stone.</hi> This <hi>Lining</hi> is of a close
substance; yet composed of <hi>Bladders,</hi> exquisitely small and hardly visible.
By which means,<note place="margin">Tab. 80.</note> it soon becomes a very hard and dry <hi>Body;</hi> and is
hereby fitted, both to promote the induration of the rest of the <hi>Stone;</hi>
and the seasonable drying, and so, the shrinking up, of the <hi>Covers</hi> of
the <hi>Seed,</hi> to make room for its <hi>Growth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. The <hi>Stone</hi> being made hard and dry; it could never be so
sufficiently softned by lying under ground, but that, it would keep the
<hi>Seed</hi> a perpetual prisoner, unless it were also made pretty easily to cleave
in two.<note place="margin">Tab. 80.</note> For which purpose, the <hi>Skin</hi> of the <hi>Fruit</hi> doth observably
conduce. For in a <hi>Slice</hi> of a young <hi>Aprecock</hi> cut transversly with a
very sharp knife, it may be seen, especially with the help of a <hi>Glass,</hi> to
be doubled inward from the two <hi>Lips</hi> of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and so to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100350:133"/>
not only through the <hi>Pulp,</hi> but also through the <hi>Stone</hi> it self,
into the hollow of the same, where it meets, and is united with the
<hi>Lining</hi> thereof. Whereby, as it further helps to the drying and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the <hi>Stone;</hi> so also renders it cleavable in that part, where it runs
through it. And therefore, whereas towards the <hi>Stalk,</hi> it goes no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to the <hi>Seed-Branch,</hi> and so but half way through the <hi>Stone:</hi>
towards the <hi>Top</hi> of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> where the <hi>Radicle</hi> stands, and where
the <hi>Stone</hi> begins to cleave, it runs quite through it.</p>
                     <p>7. §. <hi>Nature</hi> having thus provided a convenient <hi>Uterus,</hi> She next
taketh care about the <hi>Membranes</hi> of the <hi>Foetus.</hi> These are <hi>Three</hi> appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
distinct, and in many respects different one from another.</p>
                     <p>8. §. The outer <hi>Membrane</hi> is derived from the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> which
surrounds the <hi>Seed-Branch;</hi> which, upon its entry into the hollow of
the <hi>Stone,</hi> is expanded, as it were, into two <hi>Bladders,</hi> one within an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;<note place="margin">Tab. 80.</note>
whereof, one becomes the <hi>Lining</hi> of the <hi>Stone;</hi> the other,
this outer <hi>Membrane:</hi> as is best seen by cuting a young <hi>Aprecock,</hi> when
it is about half an Inch long, down through the midle, or from the <hi>Seat</hi>
of the <hi>Flower</hi> to the <hi>Stalk,</hi> between the two <hi>Lips.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. §. This outer <hi>Membrane,</hi> at this age, hath a good full and frim
<hi>Body,</hi> about 1/12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of an Inch thick, or through an ordinary <hi>Glass,</hi> half an
Inch, where it is thickest, as at the <hi>Sides</hi> and the greater end: the
<hi>Poynt</hi> being thinner, for the more easy eruption of the <hi>Radicle</hi> into the
<hi>Earth.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 80.</note> Composed of <hi>Bladders,</hi> through an ordinary <hi>Glass,</hi> about as
big, as a <hi>Colewort-Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. §. Throughout this <hi>Membrane,</hi> the <hi>Vessels</hi> conteined in the
<hi>Seed-Branch</hi> are distributed. Beginning a little below the smaller end of
the <hi>Coat</hi> or <hi>Membrane,</hi> they thence fetch their circuit both ways round
about, just beneath the <hi>Surface</hi> of the <hi>Membrane,</hi> and at last, meet in
the midle of the greater end, where they are all inosculated, so as to
make a kind of <hi>umbilical Node.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 80.</note> From whence they strike deeper into
it, and at last, into the midle <hi>Membrane,</hi> in which they presently become
invisible. By these <hi>Vessels,</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> is brought and spewed into the midle
<hi>Membrane.</hi> So that the outer <hi>Membrane</hi> seemeth, in some respects, to
be answerable to the <hi>Placenta</hi> in <hi>Animals.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. §. The midle <hi>Membrane,</hi> is derived from the bottome of the
Outer. From whence especially, but also round about, the <hi>Bladders</hi>
hereof (all angular) are more and more amplified towards the <hi>Centre;</hi>
most of them being at least two hundred times biger,<note place="margin">Tab<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 80.</note> than those of the
Outer <hi>Membrane:</hi> whereby it looks, through a <hi>Glass,</hi> not unlike a
<hi>Coome</hi> full of <hi>Hony;</hi> or in regard of their great transparency, like a
company of little <hi>Crystal Pans</hi> full of a pure <hi>Lympha.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. §. This Midle <hi>Membrane,</hi> is properly so called, from the state
and condition it hath, upon the <hi>Augmentation</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> at which
time, it obteins the nature of an <hi>Involucrum.</hi> But originally, it is
every where entire, without any <hi>Hollow,</hi> filling up the <hi>Cavity</hi> of the
Outer <hi>Membrane,</hi> like a soft and delicate <hi>Pulp.</hi> After a short time,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100350:133"/>
there appears in it a small <hi>Ductus</hi> or <hi>Chanel;</hi> which runs from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
to the top,<note place="margin">Tab. 81.</note> like an <hi>Axis,</hi> through the midle of it. At first,
no wider than to receive the <hi>Hair</hi> of a <hi>Mans Head;</hi> not visible, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in a slice hereof cut transversly, and viewed in a <hi>Glass.</hi> Being
grown a little wider, it may be seen, if the <hi>Membrane</hi> be dexterously
cut by the length. At which time, it is also dilated into two <hi>Oval
Cavities,</hi> one at each end: which are as two little <hi>Cisterns,</hi> whereinto
a most pure <hi>Lympha</hi> continually owzeth, and is therein reserved for
the nourishment of the <hi>Seed;</hi> and through the <hi>Chanel</hi> which runs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Cisterns</hi> is emptied out of one <hi>Cistern</hi> into another, according
as the <hi>Seed</hi> or the Inmost <hi>Membrane</hi> hath need of it; <hi>i. e.</hi> as the <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
and other Circumstances do more or less accelerate their <hi>Growth,</hi>
and so render the <hi>Lympha</hi> useful to them.</p>
                     <p>13. §. A few days after this, the Innermost <hi>Membrane</hi> begins to
appear; growing, like a soft <hi>Node</hi> or <hi>Bud,</hi> out of the upper <hi>Cistern;</hi>
to the lower end of which it is joyned by a short and tender <hi>Stalk,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 81.</note> from
whence it is produced into a <hi>Conick-oval Figure,</hi> answerable to that of
the <hi>Cistern.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>14. §. This <hi>Membrane,</hi> though soft and full of <hi>Sap,</hi> yet being
compared with the midlemost, is a close and compact <hi>Body,</hi> composed
of <hi>Bladders</hi> above 300 times smaller than they are in that. Whereby,
as the <hi>Seed</hi> is so well guarded, as not to be supplyed with any part of
the <hi>Lympha,</hi> but the purest: so neither with any more of this, than
will suffice, without the danger of making an <hi>Inundation</hi> out of so great
a <hi>Lake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>15. §. This <hi>Membrane,</hi> if it be pulled with a most steady hand, and
very gently, upwards, it will draw a small transparent <hi>String</hi> after it
to the bottom of the Midle <hi>Membrane:</hi> The said <hi>String</hi> though for
the greater part, <hi>Parenchymous,</hi> yet being strengthened with the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture</hi>
of some <hi>Lignous Fibres;</hi> no otherwise visible in either of these
two <hi>Membranes.</hi> So that they seem, to be a small portion of those
which are inosculated at the bottome of the <hi>Outer Membrane,</hi> and
thence produced through the midlemost, underneath the <hi>Chanel,</hi> till at
last they break forth into the upper <hi>Cistern,</hi> where they form this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>Membrane:</hi> a piece of close-wrought <hi>Work,</hi> suitable to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
fineness of all the <hi>Stuff</hi> out of which it is made.</p>
                     <p>16. §. The same <hi>Membrane</hi> is originally entire, as the Midlemost:
but being grown to about the bigness of a <hi>Carvi-Seed,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 81.</note> becomes a little
hollow near the <hi>Cone.</hi> And the <hi>Lignous Fibers</hi> abovesaid, fetching their
compass from the <hi>Base,</hi> shoot forth into the <hi>Cone;</hi> and so make a very
small <hi>Node</hi> therein, for the first <hi>Essay</hi> towards the <hi>Generation</hi> of the
<hi>Seed.</hi> The said <hi>Fibers</hi> being thus spun out, to the utmost degree of fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for this purpose.</p>
                     <p>17. §. This <hi>Node,</hi> being grown about 1/5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part as big as a <hi>Cheese-Mite;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 81<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note>
it begins next to be divided by a little indenture at the <hi>Top.</hi>
which growing by degrees still deeper, the <hi>Node</hi> is hereby at length
distinguished into two <hi>Lobes</hi> or thick <hi>Leavs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="212" facs="tcp:100350:134"/>
18. §. So soon as these are finished, their <hi>Basis</hi> begins afterwards
to be contracted,<note place="margin">Tab. 81.</note> and so to be formed into a <hi>Radicle</hi> or that part of
the <hi>Seed</hi> which becomes the <hi>Root.</hi> As the <hi>Stalks</hi> of <hi>Fruits</hi> do grow
lesser, while the <hi>Fruits</hi> themselves are expanded. So that in this estate,
the <hi>Radicle</hi> is, as it were, the <hi>Stalk</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>19. §. At this time, the <hi>Seed</hi> being extream small, the <hi>Lobes</hi> are
not so manageable as to be separated one from the other. But it is
most reasonable to suppose that so soon as the <hi>Radicle</hi> is finished, the
next step, is the pushing forth of another <hi>Node,</hi> between the <hi>Lobes,</hi> in
order to the making of a <hi>Bud,</hi> and so the perfection of the <hi>Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>20. §. This being done or in doing, the <hi>Radicle</hi> or <hi>Stalk</hi> of the
<hi>Seed,</hi> contracting still more and more at the bottome, hangs at the Inner
<hi>Membrane,</hi> only by an extream small and short <hi>Ligament</hi> or <hi>Navel-String.</hi>
Which at last, also breaks; and so the <hi>Seed,</hi> as <hi>Fruits</hi> when they are
ripe,<note place="margin">Tab. 81.</note> falls off and lies loose in the Iner <hi>Membrane;</hi> this gradually shrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up and so becoming more hollow, to make room for the further
<hi>Growth</hi> of the <hi>Seed.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>NE Reason why I Dedicate the following
<hi>Discourses</hi> to Your <hi>Lordship,</hi> is, For that by
Your great and undeserved Respects, You have
obliged me to do no less.</p>
               <p>Another, my <hi>Lord,</hi> is, Because I could
not but Publickly return Your <hi>Lordship</hi>
Thanks, for minding the <hi>Royal Society</hi> of so good a Way,
they are lately resolved upon, for the Management of a
great part of their Business. Wherein, my <hi>Lord,</hi> I do more
than presume, that I also speak the Sense of the whole <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety;</hi>
I think, not any one excepted.</p>
               <p>I may with the same Confidence intimate, my <hi>Lord,</hi>
how happy they account themselves, in having a <hi>Person</hi>
so fit to prefide their Affairs, as Your <hi>Lordship.</hi> The
Largeness of your Knowledge, the Exactness of Your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Evenness of Your Comport; being some of those
necessary Qualifications, which His <hi>Majesty</hi> had in His
Eye (as right well understanding what He did) when
He fixed His Choice upon Your <hi>Lordship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know, my <hi>Lord,</hi> that there are some men, who have
<pb facs="tcp:100350:136"/>
just so much Vnderstanding, as only to teach them how to
be Ambitious: The Flattering of whom, is somewhat like
the Tickling of Children, till they fall a Dancing. But I
also know, that Your <hi>Lordship</hi> unconcerneth Your self as
much, in what I even now spake; as <hi>Caesar</hi> did himself,
when his <hi>Souldiers</hi> began to style him <hi>King.</hi> For as he said,
<hi>Non Rex, sed Caesar:</hi> So let Your <hi>Lordship</hi> be but once
nam'd, and all that follows, is but a <hi>Tautology</hi> to what You
are already known to be. Your being <hi>President</hi> of the <hi>Royal
Society,</hi> Your being the <hi>First</hi> that was Chosen, and <hi>Chosen</hi>
by so Knowing a <hi>Prince;</hi> becomes so real a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> to Your
<hi>Lordship,</hi> as leaveth Verbal ones without any sound.</p>
               <p>Whence, my <hi>Lord,</hi> I have a third Reason most naturally
emergent, which is, That I dare to submit my self, as to what I
have hereafter said, to Your <hi>Lordships</hi> Censure. You being
so able and just an <hi>Arbiter</hi> betwixt the same and all those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
therein concern'd; that You can neither be deceived, nor
corrupted, to make a Judgment in any Point, to the Injury of
either.</p>
               <p>And truly, my <hi>Lord,</hi> were it only from a Principle of self-Interest,
yet I could not desire it should be otherwise. For the
<hi>World,</hi> if it lives, will certainly grow as much more knowing
than it is; as it is now more, than it was heretofore. So
that we have as little Reason to despise <hi>Antiquity;</hi> as we can
have willingness, that we our selves should be despised by <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet some difference there is to be made; <hi>viz.</hi> betwixt those
of all <hi>Ages,</hi> who have been modestly ignorant; and those who
have thought, or pretended, that they were Omniscient. Or
if knowing and acknowledging that they were Ignorant; have
yet not been contented to be so; unless, with as good manners,
as sense, they did conjure all Mankind not to offer at the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any more than themselves.</p>
               <p>Vpon the whole, my <hi>Lord,</hi> I desire not You should be a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,</hi>
any further than You are a <hi>Judge.</hi> For if this small
<hi>Essay</hi> hath deserved the least acceptance, I am sure, that in
being one, You will be both. I am,</p>
               <closer>

DISCOURSE
Read before the
ROYAL SOCIETY
Decemb. 10. 1674.
Concerning the
NATURE, CAUSES, and POWER
OF
MIXTURE.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING the honour to perform the Task of
this day; I shall endeavour to conform to the
<hi>Phylosophy,</hi> which this <hi>Society</hi> doth profess;
which is, <hi>Reasoning grounded upon Experiment,
and the Common Notions of Sense.</hi> The former
being, without the latter, too subtle and intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible;
the latter without the former, too gross
and unmanageable: but both together, bearing
a true analogy to our selves; who are neither
Angels, nor meer Animals, but Men.</p>
               <p>The Subject I have chosen to speak of, is <hi>Mixture.</hi> Whereof, that
our <hi>Discourse</hi> may be the more <hi>consistent,</hi> and the better <hi>intelligible;</hi>
all I have to say, shall be ranged into this Method; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. First, I shall give a brief account of the received <hi>Doctrine</hi> of
<hi>Mixture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Next, lay down some <hi>Propositions</hi> of the <hi>Principles</hi> whereof all
<hi>Mixed</hi> Bodies consist.</p>
               <p>3. Then, open the true <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Mixture;</hi> or say, <hi>What</hi> it is.</p>
               <p>4. And then enumerate the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Mixture;</hi> or say, <hi>How</hi> it is
made.</p>
               <p>5. Lastly, I shall shew the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Mixture;</hi> or, <hi>What</hi> it can <hi>do.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST, As to the received <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Mixture;</hi> not to
trouble you with tedious quotations of what <hi>Aristotle, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
Fernelius, Scaliger, Sennertus, Riverius,</hi> and other
Learned men say hereof; we may suppose the whole summed
up in that <hi>Definition</hi> which <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself hath given of
it, and which the greater number of his Followers, have almost religiously
adhered to; <hi>viz.</hi> that 'tis, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. that 'tis,
<hi>Miscibilium alteratorum unio.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. de Generat. &amp; Corrupt. <hi>Cap. ult.</hi>
                     </note> Which <hi>Definition,</hi> as it is usually expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
is both <hi>Unintelligible,</hi> and <hi>Unuseful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. §. Two things are <hi>unintelligible;</hi> what they mean by <hi>Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and what by <hi>Union.</hi> In this <hi>Alteration,</hi> they say, That the very
<hi>Forms</hi> of the <hi>Elements</hi> are <hi>altered.</hi> And therefore lay it down for an
<hi>Axiom, Quod in Mixto, Formae Elementares tantum sint in potentia,</hi> But
let us see the consequence. For if in a <hi>mixed</hi> body, the <hi>Forms</hi> of the
<hi>Elements</hi> are but in <hi>potentia;</hi> then the <hi>Elements</hi> themselves are but <hi>in
potentia:</hi> for we all say, <hi>Forma dat esse.</hi> And if the <hi>Compounding
Elements,</hi> are only <hi>in poteutia;</hi> then the <hi>Compounded Body</hi> it self can
be only <hi>in potentia:</hi> yet to say it is no more, is most absurd.</p>
                  <p>3. §. As for the <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Elements</hi> in a <hi>mixed Body;</hi> they make
it such, as brings them at last to assert, the <hi>Penetration</hi> of <hi>Bodies,</hi> and
that the <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>mixed Bodies</hi> is nothing else. For they say it is made
in such sort, that every particle of the <hi>mixed Body,</hi> partaketh of the
<hi>Nature</hi> of the whole. Which <hi>Nature,</hi> ariseth from the contempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Qualities</hi> of the four <hi>Elements.</hi> Whence they conclude, That
every particle of the <hi>mixed Body,</hi> containeth in it self all the four <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
Which is plainly to assert a <hi>penetration</hi> of <hi>Bodies.</hi> For every
<hi>Element</hi> is, at least, one particle; if therefore every particle of the
<hi>mixed</hi> Body, containeth four <hi>Elements;</hi> then four particles are but one.
I conclude then, That the received <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Mixture</hi> is <hi>Unintelligible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. §. Whence it follows, That it is also <hi>Barren</hi> and <hi>Unuseful.</hi> For
who can make any use of that which he understandeth not? And the
experience of so many years, wherein it hath been ventilated by the
disputes of men, proveth as much: Scarce any of them, except the
Learned <hi>Sennertus,</hi> daring to venture upon Experiment, for fear they
should come to understand themselves.</p>
                  <p>5. §. It is confessed, that many gallant things have been found out
by artificial <hi>Mixture.</hi> But no thanks to this <hi>Definition</hi> of it. For as
an <hi>Ignorant</hi> Man may make bad <hi>Work,</hi> and a good <hi>Rule</hi> be never the
worse; so one that is <hi>Iugenious</hi> may make good <hi>Work,</hi> and a bad <hi>Rule</hi>
be never the better. The question is not, what have men done? but
what have they done upon this foundation, <hi>Quod Mixitio sit mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilium
alteratorum unio.</hi> Had this ever taught them to do any thing,
even so much as to make the <hi>Inke</hi> wherewith they have wrote, all
their <hi>Disputes;</hi> I confess, they would have had something to shew for
it. But the truth is, their <hi>notions</hi> of <hi>Mixture,</hi> have been so far from
doing us any good, that they have done us much harm: being, through
their seeming subtlety, but real absurdity, as so many phantastick
<hi>Spectrums,</hi> serving only to assright men from coming near them, or the
Subject whereof they treat.</p>

§. 6. I shall therefore endeavour to open the true <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Mixture.</hi>
And I shall build my <hi>Doctrine</hi> upon the <hi>Common Notions</hi> of <hi>Sense:</hi>
which none can <hi>deny;</hi> and every one may <hi>conceive</hi> of. In order to
which, I shall take leave to lay down some <hi>Propositions,</hi> of the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of all <hi>mixed Bodies.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Of the Principles of Bodies.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND first, by <hi>Principles,</hi> I mean <hi>Atomes,</hi> or certain
<hi>Sorts</hi> of <hi>Atomes,</hi> or of the <hi>simplest</hi> of <hi>Bodies.</hi> For
otherwise they would not be <hi>Principles;</hi> for a
<hi>compounded Principle,</hi> in strict speaking, is a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</hi>
Even as <hi>Fives, Threes,</hi> or <hi>Two's</hi> are
not the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Number,</hi> but <hi>Unites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. §. Whence, secondly, it follows, that they
are also <hi>Indivisible.</hi> Not <hi>Mathematically;</hi> for the <hi>Atomes</hi> of every <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
have their <hi>Dimensions.</hi> But <hi>Physically;</hi> and so, what is but <hi>one,</hi>
cannot be made <hi>two.</hi> If it be asked, Whether a Stick cut with a Knife,
be not of one, made two? I say, that a Stick, is not <hi>one</hi> Body, but
<hi>many millions</hi> of Bodies; that is, of <hi>Atomes;</hi> not any one whereof is
<hi>divided</hi> within it self, but only they are <hi>separated</hi> one from another,
where the Knife forceth its way. As in the drawing of a mans Finger
through a Heap of Corn; there is no <hi>Division</hi> made in any one
<hi>Grain,</hi> but only a <hi>separation</hi> of them one from another, all remaining
still in themselves entire. I say, therefore, that what is <hi>Physically
one,</hi> is also most firm, and <hi>Indivisible,</hi> that is, <hi>Impenetrable:</hi> for <hi>Penetration</hi>
is but the <hi>Separation,</hi> not the <hi>Division</hi> of <hi>Atomes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. §. Hence, thirdly, they are also <hi>Immutable.</hi> For that which
cannot be <hi>divided,</hi> cannot be <hi>chang'd.</hi> So that of the whole World
of <hi>Atomes,</hi> not any one hath ever suffer'd, or can suffer the least <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
Hereupon is grounded the <hi>Constancy</hi> of <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Effects.</hi> So
that, in all <hi>Generations,</hi> it is not less certain, that the self same <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
is still <hi>propagated</hi> from the same; than, that <hi>Man</hi> is from <hi>Man.</hi>
Wherefore, <hi>compounded Bodies</hi> are <hi>generated;</hi> but <hi>Principles</hi> are not,
but only <hi>propagated;</hi> that is, in every <hi>Generation,</hi> they pass, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unaltered, from one Body, into another.</p>
                  <p>4. §. If <hi>Principles,</hi> or <hi>Atomes</hi> are all <hi>Immutable;</hi> it again follows.
That they are of <hi>Divers Kinds.</hi> For one and the same <hi>Principle,</hi> or <hi>Kind</hi>
of <hi>Atomes,</hi> will still make the <hi>Same</hi> Thing, and have the <hi>same Effect:</hi> so
that all <hi>Generations</hi> would then be the <hi>Same.</hi> Wherefore, since they
are <hi>Immutable,</hi> they must be <hi>Divers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. §. This <hi>Diversity,</hi> for the same reason, is not small, but very
<hi>Numerous.</hi> For as the <hi>World,</hi> taken together, is <hi>Natures Shop;</hi> so the
<hi>Principles</hi> of Things are her <hi>Tools,</hi> and her <hi>Materials.</hi> Wherefore, as
it speaks the <hi>goodness</hi> of a <hi>Shop;</hi> so the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the <hi>Universe,</hi> That it
is furnished with many <hi>Tools</hi> wherewith, and many <hi>Materials</hi> whereupon
to <hi>work.</hi> And consequently, that <hi>Philosophy</hi> beareth best its own name;
which doth not strain all to two or three <hi>Principles,</hi> like two or three
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100350:138"/>
Bells in a Steeple, making a pitiful <hi>Chime:</hi> but tryeth to rise up to
<hi>Natures</hi> own <hi>Number,</hi> and so to <hi>ring</hi> all the <hi>Changes</hi> in the World.</p>
                  <p>6. §. Yet doth not this vast <hi>Diversity</hi> take away the <hi>Regiment</hi> and
<hi>Subordination</hi> of <hi>Principles.</hi> There being a certain lesser <hi>number</hi> of
them, which either by their greater <hi>quantity,</hi> or other ways, have
<hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> in their several <hi>Orders,</hi> over all the rest. For
where-ever the <hi>Subject</hi> is <hi>Multitude, Order</hi> is part of its <hi>Perfection.</hi> For
<hi>Order</hi> is <hi>Proportion.</hi> And how can <hi>Nature</hi> be imagin'd to hold <hi>Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in all things else, and not here? Wherefore, as certainly, as <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
and <hi>Government</hi> are in all the Parts of the <hi>Rational;</hi> so certainly,
of the <hi>Material World.</hi> Whence it is, That although the <hi>Species</hi> of
<hi>Principles</hi> be very <hi>numerous;</hi> yet the <hi>Principles</hi> called <hi>Galenical, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical,</hi>
or any others, which do any way fall under the notice of
Sense, are notwithstanding <hi>reduceable</hi> to a <hi>smaller number: viz.</hi> according
to the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>Predominant Principles</hi> in <hi>Nature;</hi> or, rather in this part
of the <hi>Universe</hi> which is <hi>near and round about us.</hi> To the <hi>Power</hi> and
<hi>Empire</hi> whereof, all other <hi>Principles</hi> do submit. Which <hi>Submission,</hi> is
not the <hi>quitting</hi> of their own <hi>Nature;</hi> but only their appearance under
the external Face or <hi>Habit</hi> of the said <hi>Predominant Principles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. §. As there can be no <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Principles,</hi> without <hi>Diversity;</hi>
so no <hi>Diversity,</hi> but what is <hi>originally</hi> made by these two ways; <hi>sc.</hi> by
<hi>Size</hi> and <hi>Figure.</hi> By <hi>these</hi> they may be exceeding different: and all
other <hi>Properties</hi> besides, whereby they differ, must be <hi>dependent</hi> upon
<hi>these Two.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. §. Nor therefore, can they be of any other <hi>Figures,</hi> than what
are <hi>Regular.</hi> For <hi>Regularity, is a Similitude continu'd.</hi> Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all kinds of <hi>Atomes</hi> are <hi>divers</hi> only by their <hi>Size</hi> and <hi>Figure;</hi> if
the selfe same <hi>Size</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> were not <hi>common</hi> to a certain number of
<hi>Atomes,</hi> they could not be said to be of any <hi>one kind:</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if there were no <hi>Similitude</hi> of <hi>Atomes,</hi> there could be no <hi>Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
of <hi>Principles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. §. Hence also, these two <hi>Modes</hi> of <hi>Atomes, viz.</hi> their <hi>Size</hi> and
<hi>Figure,</hi> are the true, and only <hi>original Qualities</hi> of <hi>Atomes.</hi> That is,
an <hi>Atome</hi> is <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such,</hi> because it is of such a certain <hi>Size</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. §. Lastly, As these two <hi>Modes,</hi> taken severally, are the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi>
of an <hi>Atome:</hi> so consider'd together, they are its <hi>Form.</hi> A <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Form</hi> of a <hi>Body,</hi> being an unintelligible thing. I say of a
<hi>Body;</hi> for although the <hi>Rational Soul</hi> be a <hi>substantial Form,</hi> yet is
it the <hi>Form</hi> of a <hi>Man,</hi> and not of a <hi>Body.</hi> For the <hi>Form</hi> of a <hi>Body,</hi>
we can conceive of no otherwise, than as of the <hi>Modification</hi> of a <hi>Body,</hi>
or a <hi>Complexion</hi> of all the <hi>Modes</hi> of a <hi>Body.</hi> Which also agrees with
that <hi>Definition</hi> of a <hi>Form,</hi> which amongst the <hi>Peripatetick Philosophers</hi>
is well enough accepted, <hi>viz. Quod sit, Ratio ejus Essentiae, quae cuique Rei
competit.</hi> Which <hi>Ratio,</hi> if it be referred to a <hi>Body,</hi> what is it, but the
<hi>Modification</hi> of that <hi>Body?</hi> Having thus proposed a Summary of my
<hi>Thoughts</hi> about <hi>Principles;</hi> I shall next proceed to shew what their
<hi>Mixture</hi> is.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of the NATURE of Mixture.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND first of all, from the <hi>Premisses,</hi> we arrive at this
<hi>Conclusion; sc.</hi> That the <hi>Formation</hi> and <hi>Transformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of all Bodies, can be nothing else, but the <hi>Mixture</hi>
of Bodies.<note place="margin">Ch. 2. §. 3.</note> For all <hi>Principles</hi> are <hi>immutable;</hi> as we
have above proved: and therefore not <hi>generable,
formable,</hi> or <hi>transformable.</hi> And the <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ch. 2. §. 10.</note>
being but their <hi>Modes,</hi> are also <hi>immutable.</hi>
So that the whole <hi>Business</hi> of the <hi>Material World,</hi> is nothing else, but
<hi>Mixture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. §. Again, as <hi>Nature</hi> worketh every where only by <hi>Mixture;</hi>
so is this <hi>Mixture</hi> every where but <hi>one thing,</hi> and can be but <hi>one.</hi> For
whether it be the <hi>Mixture</hi> of <hi>great</hi> Bodies, or of <hi>small;</hi> of <hi>Compounds,</hi>
or of <hi>Atomes;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ch. 2. §. 2.</note> it is every where <hi>Mixture,</hi> and the <hi>Mixture</hi> of <hi>Bodies.</hi>
Wherefore, <hi>Mixture</hi> is either an <hi>intelligible Affection</hi> of <hi>all</hi> Bodies, or
of <hi>none;</hi> which later, no man will say. As many ways therefore, as
we can <hi>see,</hi> or <hi>conceive</hi> the <hi>Mixture</hi> of any <hi>gross</hi> Bodies, which we
hold in our hand; so many ways, we may, of the <hi>subtilest Mixtures</hi>
which <hi>Nature</hi> maketh, or of <hi>Atomes</hi> themselves; and no other ways.</p>
                  <p>3. §. Now all the ways we can distinguish <hi>Mixture</hi> by, are, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
these <hi>Two;</hi> either in respect of the <hi>Bodies Mixed,</hi> or else of the
<hi>Modes</hi> of the <hi>Mixture</hi> it self.</p>
                  <p>4. §. In respect of the <hi>Bodies Mixed, Mixture</hi> is distinguished al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<hi>two</hi> ways; <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Conjugation,</hi> and by <hi>Proportion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. §. By <hi>Conjugation,</hi> I mean, a <hi>Mixture of some certain Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and not of others.</hi> Which is <hi>threefold. First,</hi> As to <hi>Number:</hi>
as when one Body may be compounded of <hi>two Principles,</hi> another of
<hi>three,</hi> a third of <hi>four,</hi> a fourth of <hi>five,</hi> and so on. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to
<hi>Kind:</hi> where, though there be a conjunction of the same <hi>Number,</hi>
yet not of the same <hi>Kind. Thirdly,</hi> When they differ from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
both in <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Kind.</hi> So many ways the <hi>Principles</hi> of
Bodies may be conceived to be <hi>Conjugated;</hi> and therefore are:
for here, that which <hi>may</hi> be, <hi>is.</hi> The Consequence is clear. For
<hi>first,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ch. 2. §. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Nature</hi> hath various <hi>Materials</hi> wherewith to make these <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi>
as we have shewed. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By these <hi>Mixtures</hi> she <hi>may,</hi> and
without the concurrence of any imaginary <hi>Forms, must</hi> produce all the
varieties in the <hi>material World;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ch 3. §. 1.</note> as likewise hath been said. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
since all imaginable <hi>Mixtures may</hi> be <hi>made,</hi> and that to <hi>some pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;</hi>
if they should not be <hi>so, Nature</hi> would be <hi>Imperfect:</hi> because
we our selves can think, how she might put her <hi>Materials</hi> to further
use, then <hi>so</hi> she would do. To think therefore, that all <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
or all <hi>Elements</hi> go to make up every <hi>Compounded Body,</hi> as by the
<hi>Peripatetick Philosophy</hi> we are taught; is a conceit, no more to be
credited, than one that should tell us, all <hi>Kind</hi> of <hi>Wheels</hi> and other
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100350:139"/>
                     <hi>parts</hi> of a <hi>Watch,</hi> were put into a <hi>Clock;</hi> or that there were no other
<hi>Materials</hi> wherewith to build an <hi>House,</hi> then for a <hi>Tent</hi> or a <hi>Ship.</hi> For
why should <hi>Nature,</hi> the great <hi>Artificer</hi> by which all <hi>perfect Works</hi> are
made, be feigned to cram and ram <hi>all things into one,</hi> which we our
selves look upon as absurd?</p>
                  <p>6. §. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Mixture</hi> of <hi>Principles</hi> is diversifi'd, as by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation,</hi>
so also by <hi>Proportion.</hi> That is, by the divers <hi>Quantities,</hi> of
the several <hi>Principles</hi> or <hi>Parts mixed</hi> together. As if the <hi>Quantity</hi> of
one, were as <hi>five</hi> to <hi>ten;</hi> of a second, as <hi>five</hi> to <hi>fifteen;</hi> of a third, as
<hi>five</hi> to <hi>twenty,</hi> &amp;c. Or if that of one, be as <hi>five</hi> to <hi>six;</hi> of a second,
as <hi>six</hi> to <hi>seven;</hi> of a third, as <hi>seven</hi> to <hi>eight.</hi> By which, and by other
<hi>Proportions, Mixture</hi> may be varied innumerable ways.</p>
                  <p>7. §. <hi>Again,</hi> As <hi>Mixture</hi> is varied with respect to the <hi>Bodies Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
so likewise in respect of the <hi>Mixture</hi> it self, which I call the <hi>Loca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Principles,</hi> or the <hi>Modes</hi> of their <hi>Conjunction.</hi> Which may be
various, as well as their <hi>Conjugation</hi> and <hi>Proportion.</hi> Yet are they all
reduceable unto <hi>two</hi> general <hi>Modes:</hi> all <hi>Bodies,</hi> and therefore all <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ch. 2. §. 2.</note>
being <hi>mixed</hi> either by <hi>Mediation,</hi> or by <hi>Contact.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. §. Now all <hi>Contact,</hi> whether of <hi>Compounds,</hi> or of <hi>Atomes,</hi> can
be no other way, than such as is answerable to their <hi>Figures.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
therefore, we can conceive but <hi>three</hi> general ways, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> by <hi>Contract</hi> in a <hi>Point,</hi> or some <hi>smaller part:</hi> as when <hi>two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes</hi>
meet, which are <hi>globular</hi> or otherwise <hi>gibbose. Secondly,</hi> By
<hi>Contact</hi> in a <hi>Plain:</hi> as in the conjunction of the <hi>sides</hi> of <hi>Triangular</hi> or
<hi>Quadrangular Atomes,</hi> or otherwise <hi>flat. Thirdly,</hi> By <hi>Contact</hi> in a
<hi>Concave:</hi> as when one <hi>Atome</hi> is admitted into the <hi>Concave</hi> or <hi>hole</hi> of
another; as a Spigot is into a Fosset. The <hi>first</hi> may be called, <hi>Apposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
the <hi>second, Application;</hi> the <hi>third, Reception</hi> or <hi>Intrusion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. §. In the <hi>two last</hi> ways, <hi>Atomes</hi> may be joyned by <hi>Mediation;</hi>
but best of all the <hi>last.</hi> As when the <hi>two extreams</hi> of one <hi>Atome</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the <hi>Concaves</hi> or the <hi>holes</hi> of two others.</p>
                  <p>10. §. And these are all the <hi>general</hi> ways, whereby we can conceive
Bodies to be <hi>Mixed</hi> together; <hi>sc.</hi> by their various <hi>Conjugation, Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Location.</hi> So that the <hi>Composition</hi> of <hi>Atomes,</hi> in <hi>Bodies;</hi> is
like that of <hi>Letters,</hi> in <hi>Words.</hi> What a Thunderclap would such a
<hi>Word</hi> be, wherein all the four and twenty <hi>Letters</hi> were pack'd up?
One therefore is compounded of more, another of fewer: this of some,
and that of others: and both the <hi>Conjugation, Proportion,</hi> and <hi>Locati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of <hi>Letters</hi> is varied in every <hi>Word:</hi> whereby, we have many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of <hi>differing Words,</hi> without any <hi>alteration</hi> at all, in the <hi>Letters
themselves;</hi> and might have ten times as many more. In like manner,
therefore, or in the self same analogous way, as the <hi>Letters</hi> of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet,</hi>
are the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Words;</hi> so <hi>Principles,</hi> are the <hi>Alphabet</hi> of
<hi>Things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. §. What we have said of <hi>Principles;</hi> and of <hi>Mixture</hi> as conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
thereupon; may be a <hi>foundation</hi> for an <hi>intelligible</hi> account, of
the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Cause</hi> of most of the Intrinsick <hi>Properties,</hi> and <hi>Qualities</hi>
of <hi>Bodies:</hi> as of <hi>Gravity, Levity, Fixity, Fluidity, Angularity, Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Heat, Cold, Blackness, Whiteness, Sowerness, Sweetness, Fragran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Fetidness,</hi> and very many more. I say an <hi>intelligible</hi> account; <hi>sc.</hi>
such as is grounded upon the <hi>Notions</hi> of <hi>Sense,</hi> and made out <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically.</hi>
But the exemplification hereof, being too large a field
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100350:139"/>
for this, or any one <hi>Lecture,</hi> I shall, before I come to the <hi>Causes</hi> of
<hi>Mixture,</hi> only deduce from the <hi>Premises,</hi> these following <hi>Corollaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. §. <hi>First,</hi> That there is no <hi>alteration</hi> of <hi>Principles</hi> or of <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
in the most <hi>perfect Mixture</hi> of Bodies. It <hi>cannot</hi> be; for <hi>Principles</hi>
are <hi>Immutable,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ch. 2. §. 3.</note> as we have said. And if it could be, yet it <hi>needeth not</hi>
to be: for they are also <hi>many,</hi> and <hi>compoundable infinite</hi> ways; as
hath been shewed.<note place="margin">Ch. 2. §. 5.</note> So that we have no need to perplex our selves
with any of those difficulties,<note place="margin">Ch. 3. §. 10.</note> that arise from the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the
<hi>Alteration</hi> of <hi>Elements.</hi> The ground of which conceit, is that, of
three being but four <hi>Elements,</hi> and all in every particle of the
<hi>mixed Body.</hi> And so men being puzeled, how from thence to make
out the infinite <hi>variety</hi> of Bodies, they feigned them to be alterable,
and <hi>altered,</hi> upon every <hi>perfect Mixture.</hi> Not considering, that if
their four <hi>Elements</hi> be <hi>alterable;</hi> as few as they are, no fewer then
<hi>three</hi> of them may be spared: for <hi>one Element,</hi> if <hi>alterable,</hi> may be made
<hi>any.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. §, Hence, <hi>Secondly,</hi> may be solved that great <hi>Dispute,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such as we call <hi>Lixivial Salts,</hi> are <hi>made</hi> by the <hi>fire?</hi> For <hi>first,</hi>
No <hi>Principle</hi> is made by the <hi>fire:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ch. 2. §. 3.</note> all <hi>Principles</hi> being <hi>unalterable;</hi>
and therefore <hi>unmakable. Secondly,</hi> We must therefore distinguish
betwixt the <hi>Principle,</hi> and its various <hi>Mixture</hi> with other <hi>Principles;</hi>
from whence it may receive different <hi>Shapes</hi> and <hi>Names.</hi> Wherefore,
a <hi>Lixivial Salt, qua Lixivial,</hi> is certainly <hi>made</hi> by the <hi>fire.</hi> But <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus
Salt,</hi> it is not: that <hi>Principle</hi> being <hi>extractable</hi> out of <hi>most</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
and by <hi>divers</hi> other <hi>ways,</hi> then by the <hi>fire.</hi> For whether you
<hi>Calcine</hi> a body, or else <hi>Ferment</hi> it, (after the manner shewed by the
<hi>curious Improver</hi> of <hi>Chimical</hi> Knowledg, <hi>Dr. Daniel Cox)</hi> or <hi>putrifie</hi>
it under ground, or <hi>drown</hi> it in the Sea; it still yieldeth <hi>some kind</hi>
of <hi>Salt.</hi> All which <hi>Salts</hi> are <hi>made,</hi> not by <hi>making</hi> the <hi>Saline Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi>
but only by its being differently <hi>Mixed,</hi> by those several ways
of the <hi>Solution</hi> of Bodies) with other <hi>Principles:</hi> from which its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<hi>Mixture,</hi> it receives the <hi>various Denominations,</hi> of <hi>Marine, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,
Volatile,</hi> or <hi>Lixivial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. §. Hence, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the most <hi>perfect Mixture</hi> of Bodies, can
go no higher than <hi>Contact.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ch. 2. §. 3.</note> For all <hi>Principles</hi> are <hi>unalterable;</hi> and all
<hi>Matter</hi> is <hi>impenetrable;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ch. 3. §. 2.</note> as hath been said. In the most <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>laxe
Mixture,</hi> there is <hi>Contact;</hi> and in the most <hi>subtile</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> as in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi>
it self, there is <hi>nothing more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. §. Hence, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> we easily understand, how divers of the
same <hi>Principles,</hi> belonging both to <hi>Vegetables</hi> and many <hi>other</hi> Bodies,
are also <hi>actually</hi> existent in the Body of <hi>Man</hi> Because even in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
or <hi>Transmutation,</hi> the <hi>Principles</hi> which are translated from one
Body to another, as from a <hi>Vegetable</hi> to an <hi>Animal,</hi> are not in the least
<hi>alter'd</hi> in themselves; but only their <hi>Mixture,</hi> that is, their <hi>Conjugation,
Proportion</hi> and <hi>Location,</hi> is <hi>varied.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>16. §. Hence also the difference of <hi>Mixture,</hi> arising from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of <hi>Contact,</hi> is intelligible; <hi>sc.</hi> as to those <hi>three degrees, Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
Union,</hi> and <hi>Concentration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Congregation,</hi> and <hi>Inconsistent Mixture,</hi> is when the several <hi>Atomes</hi>
touch but in a <hi>Point,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ch. 3. §. 8</note> or <hi>smaller part.</hi> In <hi>which</hi> manner, I have divers
arguments, inducing me to believe the <hi>Atomes</hi> of all <hi>Fluid Bodies, qua
Fluid,</hi> do touch; and in <hi>no other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:100350:140"/>
                     <hi>Union,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ch. 3. §. 8.</note> is when they touch in a <hi>Plain.</hi> As in the <hi>Crystals</hi> and <hi>Shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
of all <hi>Salts,</hi> and <hi>other</hi> like Bodies. For if we pursue their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
and subdivided parts, with our eye, as far as we can; they still
<hi>terminate,</hi> on every side, in <hi>Plains.</hi> Wherefore, 'tis intelligible, That
their very <hi>Atomes</hi> do also <hi>terminate,</hi> and therefore <hi>touch,</hi> in <hi>Plain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concentration,</hi> is when two, or more <hi>Atomes</hi> touch by <hi>Reception</hi>
and <hi>Intrusion</hi> of one into another:<note place="margin">Ch. 3. §. 8.</note> which is the <hi>closest,</hi> and <hi>firmest
Mixture</hi> of all; as in any <hi>fixed unodorable,</hi> or <hi>untastable</hi> Body: the
<hi>Atomes</hi> of such Bodies, being not able to make any <hi>Smell</hi> or <hi>Taste,</hi>
unless they were first <hi>dissolved;</hi> that is to say, <hi>unpin'd</hi> one from
another.</p>
                  <p>17. §. Hence, <hi>Sixthly,</hi> we understand, how in some cases, there
seemeth to be a <hi>Penetration</hi> of <hi>Bodies;</hi> and in what <hi>sense</hi> it may be
admitted: <hi>viz.</hi> if we will mean no more by <hi>Penetration,</hi> but <hi>Intrusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
For the <hi>Intrusion</hi> of one <hi>Atome</hi> into the <hi>Concave</hi> or <hi>hole</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is a <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>Penetration;</hi> whereby they take up less room in
the <hi>mixed</hi> Body, then they would do by any other way of <hi>Contact.</hi>
As a naked knife and its sheath, take up almost double room, to what
they do, when the knife is sheathed. Whence we may assign the
<hi>reason,</hi> Why many <hi>Liquors</hi> being <hi>mixed;</hi> take up less room or space,
then they did <hi>apart;</hi> as the <hi>Ingenious</hi> Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> hath made it to appear
by <hi>Experiment,</hi> that they do. I say the plain <hi>reason</hi> hereof, or at least
one reason, is the <hi>Intrusion</hi> of many of their <hi>Atomes</hi> into one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Which yet is not a <hi>Penetration</hi> of Bodies strictly so called.</p>
                  <p>18. §. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> If all that <hi>Nature maketh,</hi> be but <hi>Mixture;</hi> and
all this <hi>Mixture</hi> be but <hi>Contact</hi> 'tis then evident,<note place="margin">Ch. 3. §. 1.</note> That <hi>Natural</hi> and
<hi>Artificial</hi> Mixture,<note place="margin">Ch. 3. §. 14.</note> are the <hi>same.</hi> And all those <hi>seeming subtilties</hi>
whereby <hi>Philosophers</hi> have gone about to <hi>distinguish</hi> them; have
been but so many <hi>Scarcrows</hi> to affright <hi>Men</hi> from the <hi>Imitation</hi>
of <hi>Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>19. §. <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Hence it follows, That <hi>Art</hi> it self may go far in
doing what <hi>Nature</hi> doth. And who can say, how far? For we have
nothing to <hi>Make;</hi> but only to <hi>mix</hi> those <hi>Materials,</hi> which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<hi>made</hi> to our hands. Even <hi>Nature</hi> her self, as hath been said,
<hi>Maketh</hi> nothing <hi>new;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ch. 3. §. 1.</note> but only <hi>mixeth</hi> all things. So far, therefore,
as we can govern <hi>Mixture,</hi> we may do what <hi>Nature</hi> doth.</p>
                  <p>20. §. Which that we may still the better understand; let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and in the next place, see the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Mixture.</hi> For since
<hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Artificial Mixture</hi> are the <hi>same;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ch. 3. §. 18.</note> the <hi>immediate Causes</hi> of
both, are and must be the <hi>same.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW all the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Mixture</hi> we can conceive of,
must, I think, be reduced to these <hi>six</hi> in <hi>general;
viz. Congruity, Weight, Compression, Solution, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion,</hi>
and <hi>Agitation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. §. <hi>Congruity,</hi> or aptitude and <hi>respondence</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Sizes</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of <hi>Parts</hi> to be <hi>mixed:</hi>
whereby Bodies may be truly called the <hi>Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

a <hi>Square</hi> to a <hi>Square,</hi> a <hi>Convex</hi> to a <hi>Concave,</hi> or a <hi>Less</hi> to a <hi>Greater</hi> or

they are more or less easily <hi>mingleable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. §. <hi>Weight,</hi> by means whereof all <hi>Fluid</hi> Bodies, upon supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Congruity</hi> of their parts, must unavoidably <hi>mingle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. §. <hi>Compression;</hi> which either by the <hi>Air,</hi> or any other Body,
added to <hi>Weight,</hi> must, in some degree, further <hi>Mixture.</hi> Because, that
<hi>Weight</hi> it self, is but <hi>Pression.</hi> For further Proof of all the said <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
I made this <hi>Experiment;</hi> Let <hi>Oyle</hi> of <hi>Aniseeds,</hi> and <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi>
be put apart into the <hi>Receiver</hi> of an <hi>Air-Pump.</hi> And, having <hi>exhausted</hi>
it of the <hi>Air,</hi> let the <hi>two</hi> said <hi>Oyls</hi> be then affused one upon the other.
Whereupon, <hi>First,</hi> It is visible, that they here <hi>mix</hi> and <hi>coagulate</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;

without the <hi>usual compression</hi> of the <hi>Air;</hi> for that is <hi>exhausted,</hi> and
therefore only by the <hi>Congruity</hi> of their receiving and intruding parts;
and by their <hi>Weight;</hi> by <hi>which</hi> alone they are so <hi>compressed,</hi> as to make
that <hi>Intrusion. Secondly,</hi> It is also evident, That although they do <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulate;</hi>
yet not altogether so much, as when poured together in the
same manner, and quantity, in the <hi>open Air.</hi> Wherefore, <hi>Compression,</hi>
whether made by the <hi>Air,</hi> or any thing else, as it doth further the
<hi>Dissolution</hi> of some Bodies, so the <hi>Mixture</hi> of others, and the greater
the <hi>Compression,</hi> the more.</p>
                  <p>4. §. <hi>Solution;</hi> For all Bodies <hi>mix</hi> best, in <hi>Forma fluida.</hi> And
that for two reasons. <hi>First,</hi> Because the <hi>parts</hi> of a Body are not then
in a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Union,</hi> but of <hi>Separation;</hi> and therefore, in a more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>state,</hi> for their <hi>Mixture</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> with the <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>another</hi> Body.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> because then they are also in a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Motion,</hi> more or less;
and therefore, in a continual tendency towards <hi>Mixture;</hi> all <hi>Mixture</hi>
being made by <hi>Motion.</hi> Wherefore all <hi>Generations,</hi> and most <hi>perfect
Mixtures</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> are made by <hi>Fluids;</hi> whether <hi>Animal, Vegetable,</hi>
or <hi>Mineral.</hi> Which is also agreeable to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Honourable</hi>
Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> in his <hi>Excellent Treatise</hi> of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> of <hi>Gems.</hi>
And it is well known, That Bodies are ordinarily <hi>petrified,</hi> or <hi>Stones
made,</hi> out of <hi>Water.</hi> That is, out of <hi>petrifying parts</hi> dissolved <hi>per minima</hi>
in <hi>Water,</hi> as both their <hi>Menstruum</hi> and their <hi>Vehicle.</hi> Wherefore, if we
will talk of <hi>making Gold;</hi> it must not be by the Philosophers <hi>Stone,</hi> but
by the Philosophers <hi>Liquor.</hi>

5. §. <hi>Digestion.</hi> For which there is the same reason, as for <hi>Mixture,</hi>
by <hi>Solution.</hi> For, <hi>First,</hi> All heat doth <hi>attenuate,</hi> that is, still further
<hi>separate</hi> the <hi>parts</hi> of a Body; and so render them more <hi>mingleable</hi> with
the <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>another.</hi> And therefore, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Doth also add more
<hi>Motion</hi> to them, in order to their <hi>Mixture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. §. <hi>Agitation.</hi> Which I am induced to believe a great and effectual
means of <hi>Mixture,</hi> upon divers Considerations. As, <hi>First,</hi> That the
<hi>making</hi> of <hi>Blood</hi> in the <hi>Bodies</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> and the <hi>mixing</hi> of the <hi>Chyle</hi>
therewith, is very much promoted by the same means; <hi>sc.</hi> by the <hi>Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
of the parts of the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Chyle,</hi> in their continual <hi>Circulation.
Again,</hi> from the <hi>making</hi> of <hi>Butter</hi> out of <hi>Milk,</hi> by the same means:
whereby alone is made a <hi>separation</hi> of the oleous parts from the <hi>Whey,</hi>
and Conjunction of the <hi>Oleous</hi> together. <hi>Moreover,</hi> From the great
<hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Digestion;</hi> well known to all that are conversant in <hi>Chymical
Preparations.</hi> Which <hi>Digestion</hi> it self, is but a <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>insensible agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>digested</hi> Bodies. 'Tis <hi>also</hi> a known <hi>Experiment,</hi>
That the readiest way to dissolve <hi>Sugar</hi> in <hi>Wine</hi> or other <hi>Liquor;</hi> is to
give the <hi>Vessel</hi> a <hi>hasty turn,</hi> together with a <hi>smart knock,</hi> against any
<hi>hard</hi> and <hi>steady</hi> Body: whereby all the parts of the <hi>Sugar</hi> and <hi>Liquor,</hi>
are put into a vehement <hi>Agitation,</hi> and so the <hi>Sugar</hi> immediately dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and <hi>mixed</hi> with the <hi>Liquor.</hi> And I remember, that having (with
intent, to make Mr. <hi>Matthews</hi>'s <hi>Pill)</hi> put some <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Turpentine</hi> and
<hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> together in a Bottle, and sent it up hither out of the
<hi>Country;</hi> I found, that the continual <hi>Agitation</hi> upon the <hi>Road,</hi> for three
or four days, had done more towards their <hi>Mixture;</hi> than a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
time of <hi>Digestion</hi> alone had done before. And it is certain, That
a vehement <hi>Agitation,</hi> especially, if continu'd, or joyned with <hi>Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;</hi>
will accelerate the <hi>Mixture</hi> of some Bodies, ten times more, than
any bare <hi>Digestion</hi> alone; as may be proved by many <hi>Experiments.</hi> I
will instance in this one. Let some <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Turpentine</hi> and good <hi>Spirit</hi>
of <hi>Nitre</hi> be stop'd up together in a Bottle, and the Bottle held to the
Fire, till the <hi>Liquors</hi> be a little heated, and begin to bubble. Then
having removed it, and the Bubbles by degrees increasing more and
more; the two <hi>Liquors</hi> will of themselves, at last fall into so impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
an <hi>Ebullition,</hi> as to make a kind of <hi>Explosion;</hi> sending forth a <hi>smoak</hi>
for the space of almost <hi>two yards</hi> high. Whereupon, the <hi>parts</hi> of both
the <hi>Liquors,</hi> being violently <hi>agitated,</hi> they are, in a <hi>great portion, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated</hi>
into a <hi>thick Balsam</hi> in a <hi>moment:</hi> and that without any <hi>intense</hi>
heat, as may be felt by the Bottle. And thus much for the <hi>Causes</hi> of
<hi>Mixture.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>FIRST,</hi> To render all Bodies <hi>Sociable</hi> or <hi>Mingleable:</hi> as <hi>Water</hi>
with <hi>Oyl, Salt</hi> with <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the like.<note place="margin">Ch. 3. § 18;</note> For <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
Mixture,</hi> are the same; as we have before proved. If therefore
<hi>Nature</hi> can do it, as we see in the <hi>Generation</hi> of Bodies she doth, 'tis
likewise in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> to do it.</p>
                     <p>2. §. And for the doing of it, two <hi>general Rules</hi> result from the
<hi>Premisses, sc.</hi> The <hi>Application</hi> of <hi>Causes,</hi> and the <hi>Choice</hi> of <hi>Materials.</hi>
As for the <hi>Causes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ch. 4.</note> they are such as I have now instanc'd in. And for
the <hi>Application</hi> of them, I shall give these <hi>two Rules.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. <hi>First,</hi> That we tread in <hi>Natures</hi> steps as near as we can; not
only in the <hi>Application</hi> of such a <hi>Cause,</hi> as may be most proper for such a
<hi>Mixture;</hi> but also in allowing it <hi>sufficient time</hi> for its <hi>effect.</hi> For so we see
<hi>Nature</hi> her self, for her more <hi>perfect Mixtures,</hi> usually doth. She
maketh not a <hi>Flower,</hi> or an <hi>Apple,</hi> a <hi>Horse,</hi> or a <hi>Man,</hi> in a <hi>moment;</hi>
but all things <hi>by degrees;</hi> and for her more <hi>perfect and elaborate Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
for the most part, she requireth <hi>more time.</hi> Because all such
<hi>Mixtures</hi> are made and carri'd on <hi>per minima;</hi> and therefore require a
greater time for the compleating of them.</p>
                     <p>4. §. A <hi>second Rule</hi> is, Not only to make a due <hi>Application</hi> of
the <hi>Causes;</hi> but sometimes to <hi>Accumulate</hi> them. By which means, we
may not only, <hi>imitate Nature,</hi> but in some cases go beyond her. For
as by adding a <hi>Graft</hi> or <hi>Bud</hi> to the <hi>Stock,</hi> we may produce <hi>Fruit sooner,</hi>
and sometimes <hi>better,</hi> than <hi>Nature</hi> by the <hi>Stock</hi> alone would do: So
here, by <hi>accumulating</hi> the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Mixture,</hi> that is, by joyning <hi>two,
three,</hi> or <hi>more</hi> together; or by <hi>applying more</hi> in some Cases, where <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
applyeth <hi>fewer;</hi> we may be able to make, if not a more <hi>perfect,</hi>
yet a far more <hi>speedy Mixture,</hi> than <hi>Nature</hi> doth. As by joyning <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
Heat,</hi> and violent <hi>Agitation,</hi> and so continuing them all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
by some means contrived for the purpose, for the space of a
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100350:142"/>
                        <hi>Week,</hi> or <hi>Month,</hi> or <hi>longer,</hi> without cessation. Which may probably
produce, not only <hi>strange,</hi> but <hi>useful Effects,</hi> in the <hi>Solution</hi> of some,
and the <hi>Mixture</hi> of other Bodies. And may serve to <hi>mix</hi> such Bodies,
as through the <hi>small number</hi> of their <hi>congruous</hi> parts, are hardly <hi>mingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
any other way. <hi>Agitation</hi> being, as carrying the <hi>Key</hi> to and
fro, till it hit the <hi>Lock;</hi> or within the <hi>Lock,</hi> till it hit the <hi>Wards.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the <hi>Choice</hi> of <hi>materials,</hi> if they are not <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,</hi>
that is, of themselves, <hi>mingleable;</hi> we are then to turn one
<hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Mixture</hi> into a <hi>Rule;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ch. 3. §. 9.</note> which is, To <hi>mix</hi> them by <hi>mediation</hi>
of some <hi>third,</hi> whether more <hi>simple</hi> or <hi>compounded</hi> Body, which may
be congruous <hi>in part</hi> to them <hi>both:</hi> as <hi>Sulphurous Salts</hi> are to <hi>Water</hi> and
<hi>Oyl;</hi> and are for that reason <hi>mingieable</hi> with <hi>either</hi> of them. Or, By
any <hi>two</hi> congruous Bodies, which are also, <hi>in part,</hi> congruous to <hi>two
others:</hi> and other like ways. Whereby the <hi>parts</hi> of Bodies, though
never so <hi>heterogeneous,</hi> may yet be all <hi>bound</hi> and <hi>lock'd</hi> up together.
Even as <hi>twenty Keys</hi> may be <hi>united,</hi> only by <hi>uniting</hi> the <hi>two Rings</hi>
whereon they hang.</p>
                     <p>6. §. The Consideration of these things, have put me upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
several <hi>Experiments,</hi> for the <hi>mingling</hi> of <hi>heterogeneous</hi> Bodies. I
shall give two Examples of Tryal; the one upon <hi>Fluid,</hi> the other up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>consistent</hi> Bodies.</p>
                     <p>7. §. For the <hi>first,</hi> I took <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Aniseeds,</hi> and pouring it upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Body; I so order'd it, that it was thereby turned into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>milk-white Balsam,</hi> or <hi>Butyr.</hi> By which means the said <hi>Oyl</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>mingleable</hi> with any <hi>Winy,</hi> or <hi>Watery Liquor; easily,</hi> and <hi>instanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neously
dissolving</hi> therein, in the form of a <hi>Milk.</hi> And <hi>note,</hi> That
this is done, without the <hi>least alteration</hi> of the <hi>Smell, Tast, Nature,</hi> or
<hi>Operation</hi> of the said <hi>Oyl.</hi> By somewhat the like means, not only
<hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Aniseeds,</hi> but any other <hi>stillatitious Oyl,</hi> may be transformed
into a <hi>milk-white Butyr;</hi> and in like manner be <hi>mingled</hi> with
<hi>Water</hi> or any other <hi>Liquor.</hi> Which is of <hi>various use</hi> in <hi>Medicine;</hi> and
what I find oftentimes very convenient and advantageous to be
done.</p>
                     <p>8. §. Again, not only <hi>Fluid</hi> but <hi>consistent</hi> Bodies, which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
will <hi>mix</hi> only with <hi>Oyl;</hi> by due <hi>mixture</hi> with other Bodies, may
be render'd <hi>easily</hi> dissoluble in <hi>Water;</hi> as may <hi>Rosin,</hi> and all <hi>resinous</hi>
and <hi>friable Gums.</hi> As also <hi>Wax:</hi> and this without changing much
of their <hi>Color, Tast,</hi> or <hi>Smell.</hi> Whereof likewise, whatsoever others
may do, the <hi>Physician</hi> may make a manifold <hi>Use.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </div>

                     <head>INSTANCE II.</head>
                     <p>BY <hi>Mixture</hi> also, we may be <hi>taught</hi> to <hi>Imitate</hi> the <hi>Productions</hi> of
<hi>Nature.</hi> As to which, from what we have before said of <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
we may conclude; That there is no <hi>Generation</hi> of Bodies <hi>unor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical,</hi>
but what is in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Mixture</hi> to <hi>imitate.</hi> As of <hi>Animals,</hi>
to Imitate <hi>Blood, Fat, Chyle, Spittle, Flegm, Bile,</hi> &amp;c. Of <hi>Vegetables,</hi>
to Imitate a <hi>Milk, Mucilage, Rosin, Gum,</hi> or <hi>Salt.</hi> Of <hi>Minerals,</hi> to
Imitate <hi>Vitriol, Allom,</hi> and other <hi>Salts;</hi> as also <hi>Metals,</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <p>2. §. I do not say, I can do all this: yet if, upon good <hi>Premisses,</hi>
we can conclude this possible to be done; it is one step to the doing of
it. But I will also give an <hi>Instance</hi> of somewhat that may be <hi>done</hi> in
every <hi>kind.</hi> And,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="233" facs="tcp:100350:142"/>
3. §. <hi>First,</hi> For the <hi>Imitation</hi> of an <hi>Animal Body,</hi> I will instance in
<hi>Fat.</hi> Which may be <hi>made</hi> thus; Take <hi>Oyl Olive,</hi> and pour it upon
high <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre.</hi> Then <hi>digest</hi> them for some days. By degrees,
the <hi>Oyl</hi> becomes of the <hi>colour</hi> of <hi>Marrow;</hi> and at last, is <hi>congealed,</hi> or
hardned into a <hi>white Fat</hi> or <hi>Butter,</hi> which <hi>dissolveth</hi> only by the <hi>fire,</hi> as
that of <hi>Animals.</hi> In converting <hi>Oyl</hi> thus into <hi>Fat,</hi> it is to be <hi>noted,</hi>
That it <hi>hardens</hi> most upon the <hi>exhalation</hi> of some of the more <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous</hi>
parts of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre.</hi> Which I effected, well enough
for my purpose, by unstopping the glass after some time of <hi>digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and so suffering the <hi>Oyl</hi> to <hi>dissolve</hi> and <hi>thicken</hi> divers times by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
<hi>heat</hi> and <hi>cold.</hi> Hence, The true <hi>Congealing Principle,</hi> is a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Nitre separated from its Sulphur.</hi> For the better doing whereof,
the <hi>Aer</hi> is a most commodious <hi>Menstruum</hi> to the said <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre.</hi>
Whence also, if we could procure such a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre,</hi> we might <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal
Water</hi> in the midst of <hi>Summer.</hi> We might also <hi>refrigerate Rooms</hi>
herewith <hi>Artificially.</hi> And might <hi>Imitate</hi> all <hi>frosty Meteors.</hi> For the
<hi>making</hi> of <hi>Fat,</hi> is but the <hi>Durable Congelation</hi> of <hi>Oyl:</hi> which may be
done without <hi>frost,</hi> as I have shewed how.</p>
                     <p>Hence also it appears, That <hi>Animal Fat</hi> it self, is but the <hi>Curdling</hi> of
the <hi>Oyly</hi> parts of the <hi>Blood;</hi> either by some of its own <hi>Saline</hi> parts;
or by the <hi>Nitrous</hi> parts of the <hi>Aer</hi> mingled therewith.</p>
                     <p>Hence likewise it is, That some <hi>Animals,</hi> as <hi>Conies,</hi> and <hi>Fieldfares,</hi>
grow <hi>fatter</hi> in <hi>frosty</hi> weather: the <hi>oily</hi> parts of the <hi>blood,</hi> being then
more than ordinarily <hi>coagulated</hi> with a greater abundance of <hi>nitrous</hi>
parts received from the <hi>Aer</hi> into their <hi>bodies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the same reason it is, That the <hi>Fat</hi> of <hi>Land-Animals</hi> is <hi>hard;</hi>
whereas that of <hi>Fishes</hi> is <hi>very soft,</hi> and runs all to <hi>Oyl, sc.</hi> Because
the <hi>Water,</hi> wherein they live, and which they have instead of <hi>breath,</hi>
hath but very few <hi>nitrous</hi> parts in it, in comparison of what the <hi>Aer</hi>
hath.</p>
                     <p>4. §. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the <hi>Imitation</hi> of a <hi>Vegetable Body,</hi> I will give
three <hi>Instances;</hi> In <hi>Rosin, Gum,</hi> and a <hi>Lixivial Salt.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> may
be made thus; Take good <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and drop it upon <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Anise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeds;</hi>
and they will forthwith <hi>incorporate</hi> together; and by degrees,
will <hi>harden</hi> into a <hi>perfect Rosin;</hi> with the <hi>general</hi> and <hi>defining Properties</hi>
of a <hi>truly Natural Resinous Gum.</hi> Being not at all <hi>dissoluble</hi> in <hi>Water;</hi> or
at least, not any more, then any natural <hi>Rosin</hi> or <hi>Gum:</hi> yet very <hi>easily</hi>
by <hi>fire:</hi> as also higly <hi>inflamable:</hi> and exceeding <hi>friable.</hi> Although this
<hi>Artificial Rosin,</hi> be the result of <hi>two Liquors,</hi> both which very strongly
affect the <hi>Sense:</hi> yet being well <hi>washed</hi> from the <hi>unincorporated parts,</hi>
(which is to be done with some care) it hath scarce any <hi>Tast</hi> or <hi>Smell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Concentration</hi> of these <hi>two Liquors,</hi> is likewise so <hi>universal;</hi> that
the <hi>Rosin</hi> is not made by <hi>Precipitation,</hi> but almost a <hi>total Combination</hi>
of the said <hi>Liquors;</hi> and that with scarce so much, as any <hi>visible</hi> fumes.</p>
                     <p>5. §. <hi>Again,</hi> Having taken a certain <hi>Powder</hi> and a <hi>Saline Liquor,</hi>
and mixed them together in a bottle, and so <hi>digested</hi> them for some
time; the <hi>Powder</hi> was at last transmuted to a perfect <hi>Oily Gum;</hi> which
will also <hi>dissolve</hi> either in <hi>Oyl</hi> or in <hi>Water;</hi> in the self same manner, as
<hi>Galbanum, Ammoniac,</hi> and the like will do.</p>
                     <p>6. §. And <hi>Lastly,</hi> A <hi>Lixivial Salt</hi> may be <hi>imitated</hi> thus; Take
<hi>Nitre, Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and high <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> of each a like quantity.
Of these <hi>three</hi> Bodies, not any <hi>two</hi> being <hi>put together,</hi> that is to say
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:100350:143"/>
neither the <hi>Nitre</hi> with the <hi>Oyl,</hi> nor the <hi>Oyl</hi> with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> nor the
<hi>Nitre</hi> with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> will make the least <hi>Ebullition:</hi> yet all <hi>three mingled
together,</hi> make a very <hi>conspicuous one.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> being as the
<hi>Sulphur;</hi> and so that, and the <hi>Nitre</hi> together, standing, as it were, in the
stead of an <hi>Alkalizate,</hi> that is, a <hi>Sulphurious Salt,</hi> against the <hi>Oyl</hi> of
<hi>Vitriol.</hi> Divers other <hi>Experiments</hi> may be shew'n of the like Nature.</p>
                     <p>7. §. In the last place, for the <hi>Imitation</hi> of a <hi>Mineral Body,</hi> I will
instance in <hi>two, sc. Nitre</hi> and <hi>Marine Salt;</hi> if I may have leave to reckon
them amongst <hi>Mineral Bodies.</hi> As for <hi>Nitre,</hi> by mixing of <hi>four Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors</hi>
together, and then setting them to <hi>shoot;</hi> I have obtained <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stals</hi>
of <hi>true</hi> and <hi>perfect Salt;</hi> which have had much of a <hi>nitrous tast;</hi>
and would be <hi>melted</hi> with a <hi>gentle Heat,</hi> as <hi>Nitre</hi> is; and even as easily
as <hi>Butyr</hi> it self: I mean not, by the addition of any sort of <hi>Liquor,</hi>
or any other Body, to <hi>dissolve</hi> it; but only by the <hi>fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. And as for a <hi>Sea-Salt,</hi> that I might <hi>Imitate Nature</hi> for the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi>
thereof, I consider'd, That the said <hi>Salt</hi> is nothing else
but that of <hi>Animals</hi> and <hi>Vegetables,</hi> freed from its true <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi>
and some <hi>Saline particles, specifically Animal</hi> or <hi>Vegetable,</hi> together
with them. For both <hi>Animal</hi> and <hi>Vegetable</hi> Bodies being continually
carried by all <hi>Rivers</hi> into the Sea; and many likewise by <hi>Shipwrack,</hi>
and divers <hi>other</hi> ways <hi>immersed</hi> therein: they are at last <hi>corrupted,</hi> that
is, their <hi>Compounding</hi> parts are <hi>opened</hi> and <hi>resolved.</hi> Yet the <hi>Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
being in the <hi>Water,</hi> is not made <hi>precipitately,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Air;</hi>
but by degrees, and very <hi>gently;</hi> whence the <hi>Sulphurious</hi> and other
<hi>Volatile</hi> parts, in their <hi>Avolation,</hi> make not so much <hi>haste,</hi> as to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the more <hi>fixed Saline</hi> parts along with them; but leaveth them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
in the <hi>Water,</hi> which <hi>imbibeth</hi> them as their proper <hi>Menstruum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Imitation</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> herein, may be performed thus; Put
as much of a <hi>Lixivial Salt</hi> as you please, into a wide-mouth'd Bottle,
and with fair <hi>Water</hi> make a strong <hi>Solution</hi> of it; so as some part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may remain <hi>unresolved</hi> at the bottom of the Bottle. Let the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
stand thus for the space of about half or three quarters of a year, all
the time unstopped. In which time, many of the <hi>Sulphurious</hi> and <hi>other
Volatile</hi> parts gradually flying away; the top of the <hi>unresolved
Salt</hi> will be <hi>incrustate,</hi> or as it were <hi>frosted</hi> over, with many small and
hard <hi>Concretions,</hi> which, in their nature, are become a true <hi>Sea-Salt.</hi>
Whereof there is a double Proof; <hi>First,</hi> In that most of the said <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions</hi>
are of a <hi>Cubical,</hi> or very like <hi>Figure.</hi> Especially on their <hi>upper
parts;</hi> because having a <hi>fixed Body</hi> for their <hi>Basis,</hi> their <hi>under</hi> parts,
therefore, contiguous thereto, are less <hi>regular.</hi> Whereas the parts of
the <hi>Salt</hi> in the Sea, being environed on all sides with a <hi>Fluid;</hi> their <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi>
is on all sides <hi>regular. Secondly,</hi> In that a strong <hi>Acid Spirit</hi> or
<hi>Oyl</hi> being poured upon a <hi>full body'd Solution</hi> hereof; yet it maketh
herewith no <hi>Ebullition,</hi> which is also the <hi>property</hi> of <hi>Sea-Salt.</hi> And
thus much for the more <hi>General Imitation</hi> of <hi>Bodies.</hi>

                     <p>FROM the aforesaid <hi>Premisses,</hi> and by the aforesaid <hi>Means,</hi> there is
no doubt to be made, but that also the other <hi>sensible Qualities</hi> of
Bodies may be <hi>Imitated,</hi> as their <hi>Odors,</hi> and <hi>Tasts.</hi> And that not only
the <hi>general</hi> ones, as <hi>Fragrant,</hi> or <hi>Astringent:</hi> but also those which are
<hi>specifical</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> to such a <hi>species</hi> of Bodies.</p>
                     <p>2. §. Thus for <hi>Example,</hi> by <hi>mixing Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre</hi> or <hi>Vitriol</hi> with
<hi>rectified Oyl</hi> of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and some other <hi>Vegetable Oyls,</hi> severally,
and in a due <hi>Proportion</hi> and <hi>Time,</hi> I have <hi>Imitated</hi> the <hi>Smells</hi> of <hi>divers
Vegetables;</hi> as of <hi>Tansy,</hi> of <hi>Lignum Rhodium,</hi> and <hi>others.</hi> And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it feasable, To <hi>Imitate</hi> the <hi>Tast</hi> or <hi>Smell</hi> of <hi>Musk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> or <hi>Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greece,</hi>
or <hi>any other</hi> body in the world.</p>
                     <p>3. §. Hence also we may be <hi>Taught,</hi> How to <hi>Imitate</hi> the <hi>Faculties,</hi>
as well as other <hi>Qualities</hi> of Bodies. The reason is, because even <hi>these</hi>
have no dependance upon any <hi>substantial Form:</hi> but are the meer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult

                     <head>INSTANCE V.</head>
                     <p>FROM whence, <hi>again,</hi> it is likewise a <hi>Key</hi> to <hi>Discover</hi> the <hi>Nature</hi>
of Bodies. For how far soever we can attain to <hi>Mingle,</hi> or to
<hi>Make</hi> them, we may also know <hi>what they are.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. For Bodies are <hi>mingleable,</hi> either of <hi>themselves,</hi> or by some
<hi>Third.</hi> As to those which <hi>mingle of themselves,</hi> we may certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That there is a <hi>congruity</hi> betwixt them, in some respect or other.
So upon various Tryals I find, That <hi>Essential Oyls</hi> do more easily <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe</hi>
an <hi>Acid,</hi> then an <hi>Alkaly.</hi> Whence it is evident, That there is
some <hi>Congruity</hi> and <hi>Similitude</hi> betwixt <hi>Essentian Oyls,</hi> and an <hi>Acid,</hi> which
there is not betwixt the said <hi>Oyls</hi> and an <hi>Alkaly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. As to those that mingle only be some <hi>third;</hi> we may also cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
conclude, That though the <hi>two extreams</hi> are <hi>unlike;</hi> yet that
they have both of them some <hi>congruity</hi> with that <hi>third,</hi> by which they
are <hi>united.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. §. <hi>Moreover,</hi> We may make a <hi>Judgment</hi> from the <hi>manner</hi> or
<hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Mixture.</hi> Thus the <hi>Acid Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre,</hi> as is said, will <hi>coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
Oyl-Olive,</hi> and render it <hi>consistent.</hi> Whence it might be thought,
That any other strong <hi>Acid</hi> will do the like; and that therefore, there
is no great difference in the <hi>Nature</hi> of the said <hi>Acid Liquors.</hi> But the
contrary hereunto, is proved by <hi>Experiment.</hi> For having <hi>digested</hi> the
same <hi>Oyl</hi> in the same <hi>manner,</hi> and for a much <hi>longer</hi> time, with strong
<hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Sulphur;</hi> although it thence acquired some change of <hi>Colour,</hi> yet
not any <hi>Consistence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. §. <hi>Again,</hi> Because the said <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre coagulates Oyl-Olive;</hi>
it might be expected, it should have the same effect upon <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeds;</hi>
or, at least, that if other <hi>Acids</hi> will <hi>Coagulate Oyl</hi> of <hi>Aniseeds,</hi>
that this should do it <hi>best.</hi> But <hi>Experiment</hi> proveth the contrary. For
of all I have tryed, <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> is the only <hi>Acid</hi> that doth it <hi>instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneously.
Oyl</hi> of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> if very strong, will do it; but not so <hi>soon,</hi>
                        <pb n="236" facs="tcp:100350:144"/>
nor so <hi>much Aqua fortis,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> for the present, <hi>do not</hi> at
all <hi>touch</hi> it. And <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre</hi> it self will not <hi>coagulate</hi> it, under <hi>eight</hi>
or <hi>ten</hi> hours at least.</p>

                     <p>LASTLY, and <hi>consequently,</hi> It is a <hi>Key</hi> To <hi>Discover</hi> the <hi>Medicinal
Use</hi> and <hi>Operation</hi> of Bodies. Thus, for <hi>Example,</hi> by the <hi>Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Rosins</hi> and <hi>Resinous Gums,</hi> we certainly know what all of them
<hi>are,</hi> and <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>wherefore</hi> to be <hi>used.</hi> For what are <hi>Mastick, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincense,
Olibanum, Benzoin,</hi> and <hi>other like Rosins,</hi> or <hi>Resinous Gums,</hi> for
their <hi>principle</hi> and <hi>predominant</hi> parts, that is, <hi>quà Rosins;</hi> but Bodies
resulting from <hi>Natural,</hi> in like manner, as I have shewed, they may be
made to result, from <hi>Artificial Mixture?</hi> That is to say, the <hi>Oleous,</hi> and
<hi>Acid</hi> parts of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> being both <hi>affused</hi> and <hi>mingled</hi> together, <hi>per minima,</hi>
in some one sort of <hi>Vessels</hi> in a <hi>Plant,</hi> they thus <hi>incorporate</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one <hi>consistent</hi> and <hi>friable</hi> Body, which we call <hi>Rosin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. §. Now from hence it is, That the said <hi>Rosins,</hi> and <hi>Resinous
Gums;</hi> as also <hi>Amber</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> for the same Reasons; are of so great
and effectual <hi>Use</hi> against most <hi>thin</hi> and <hi>salt Rheums; sc.</hi> as they are
<hi>Acidoleous</hi> Bodies. For by their <hi>Acid</hi> parts, which in all these Bodies
are exceeding <hi>copious,</hi> they <hi>mortifie</hi> and <hi>refract</hi> those <hi>Salt</hi> ones, which
feed the <hi>Rheum.</hi> And by their <hi>oleous</hi> parts, the same <hi>Salt</hi> ones are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<hi>Imbibed.</hi> Whence, they are all, in some degree, <hi>incorporated</hi> together;
that is, The <hi>Rheum</hi> is <hi>thickned:</hi> which is the desired <hi>effect.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. Whereas, on the contrary, if the <hi>Cough</hi> proceed not from a
<hi>thin,</hi> and specially a <hi>Salt Rheum,</hi> but from a <hi>Viscous Flegm;</hi> the use of
<hi>many other</hi> Bodies which are also more <hi>oleous,</hi> and abound not so much
with an <hi>Acid</hi> as <hi>these</hi> do, espescially <hi>some</hi> of them, is more proper:
such as <hi>these,</hi> in this Case, proving sometimes not only <hi>ineffectual,</hi> but
<hi>prejudicial.</hi> Since the very <hi>Cause</hi> of the said <hi>Viscousness</hi> of <hi>Phlegm,</hi> is
chiefly some great <hi>Acidity</hi> in the <hi>Blood,</hi> or in some other <hi>part,</hi> as may
be proved by divers Arguments.</p>
                     <p>4. §. Many more <hi>Instances</hi> might be hereunto subjoyned: and may
hereafter be offered to the acceptance of such, who are inquisitive into
<hi>matters</hi> of this <hi>Nature.</hi> If I shall not herein anticipate, or reiterate the
<hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Observations,</hi> of those two <hi>Accurate</hi> and <hi>Learned Persons</hi>
Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Walter Needham,</hi> as to what the one hath already

That this may be done, by digesting any of
the said <hi>Oyls</hi> with about an equal quantity of the
<hi>Yelk</hi> of an <hi>Egg,</hi> with a very soft heat, like that of
the <hi>Meridian Sun</hi> in <hi>Summer,</hi> continued for the

and then stirred a little together. The <hi>Yelk</hi> will by degrees, imbibe the

                        </p>
                        <p>2. §. I confess, that it will be very difficult to prepare any good

possibility of such a <hi>Mixture;</hi> I considered, whether the application of

only for the mixing of the said <hi>Oyls,</hi> but likewise of all sorts of <hi>Rosins</hi>
and <hi>Gums</hi> with any <hi>winy</hi> or <hi>watery Liquor,</hi> in great quantities, in a
short time, and without much trouble. But for the mixing of some of
them, the <hi>Yelk</hi> of an <hi>Egg</hi> alone will not serve, without the interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

               <p>How far the <hi>Corollaries</hi> all along subjoyned have made this good, is

                  <head>CHAP. I. What is generally to be observed upon the Affusion of the

                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Bodies whereupon I made tryal, were of all
kinds,</hi> Animal, Vegetable, <hi>and</hi> Mineral. <hi>Amongst</hi>
Vegetables, <hi>such as these,</hi> scil. Date-stones, Ginger,
Colocynthis, Pyrethrum, Hawthorn-stones, Staphis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agria,
Euphorbium, <hi>the</hi> Arenulae <hi>in Pears,</hi> Semen
Milli Solis, Tartar, Spirit <hi>of</hi> Scurvygrass, Spirit
<hi>of</hi> Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. §. <hi>Amongst</hi> Minerals, <hi>several sorts of</hi>
Earths, Stones, Ores, Metals, Sulphurs, <hi>and</hi> Salts.</p>
                  <p>3. §. <hi>Amongst</hi> Animals; <hi>such as these,</hi> scil. Hairs, Hoofs, Horns,
Shells, <hi>and</hi> shelly Insects, Bones, Flesh, <hi>and the several</hi> Viscera, Silk,
Blood, Whites <hi>and</hi> Yelks <hi>of</hi> Eggs, Sperma Ceti, Civet, Musk, Castor,
Gall, Urine, Dungs, animal Salts <hi>and</hi> Stones.</p>
                  <p>4. §. The <hi>Liquors</hi> which I poured hereupon severally, were these,
<hi>sc. Spirit of Salt Armoniac, Spirit</hi> of <hi>Harts-Horn, Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua
fortis, Oyl</hi> of <hi>Salt, Oyl</hi> of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol;</hi> commonly
so called.</p>
                  <p>5. §. In the <hi>Mixture</hi> of these Bodies, two things, in general, are
all along to be observed, <hi>viz. First,</hi> which they are, that make <hi>any,</hi>
or <hi>no Luctation.</hi> For, as some which seem to promise it, make none:
So, many, contrary to expectation, make a considerable one.</p>
                  <p>6. §. <hi>Next,</hi> the <hi>manner</hi> wherein the <hi>Luctation</hi> is made; being with
much variety in these <hi>five</hi> sensible <hi>Effects. 1. Bullition;</hi> when the
Bodies mixed produce only a certain quantity of froth or bubbles.
2. <hi>Elevation;</hi> when, like Paste in baking, or Barm in the working of
Beer, they swell and huff up. 3. <hi>Crepitation;</hi> when, they make a
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100350:146"/>
kind of hissing and sometimes a crackling noise. 4. <hi>Effervescence;</hi> then
only and properly so called, when they produce some degree of heat.
5. <hi>Exhalation;</hi> when not only fumes, but visible steams are produced.</p>
                  <p>7. §. Of all these, sometime one only happens, sometimes two or
more are concomitant. Sometimes the <hi>Luctation</hi> begins presently upon
mixture, and sometimes not till after some intermission. In some bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
it continues a great while; in others, is almost instantaneous:
Examples of all which I shall now produce; beginning with <hi>Vegetables,</hi>
as affording the least variety.</p>
                  <p>8. §. And first, if we take Spirit or Oyl of Salt, Oyl of Vitriol, Spirit
of Nitre, or Aqua fortis, and pour them severally upon the several parts of
Vegetables, as Roots, Woods, Stones, &amp;c. we shall find, that they are,
generally far less apt to make a Luctation, than either Animal, or subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal
Bodies. <hi>Whence, as from one argument, it seemeth evident, That
in most</hi> Vegetables, <hi>and in most of their parts, the predominant</hi> Salt <hi>is
an</hi> Acid. <hi>But that, on the contrary, the predominant</hi> Salt <hi>in most</hi>
Minerals, <hi>and parts of</hi> Animals, <hi>is an</hi> Alkaly: <hi>in the former, usually
a</hi> fixed; <hi>in the latter, a</hi> volatile Alkaly.</p>
                  <p>9. §. <hi>Again, although the Luctation which most Vegetables, and most
of their parts make with Acids, be but small, yet some they make; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
with some Acids, as with Spirit of Nitre and Aqua fortis.</hi> Whence
it seemeth plain, That there is an <hi>Alkaline Salt</hi> existent in many <hi>Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi>
even in their <hi>natural estate;</hi> and that it is not made <hi>Alkaline,</hi> but
only <hi>Lixivial,</hi> by the <hi>fire.</hi> Or, there is some quantity of a <hi>Salt,</hi> call
it what we will, in the said Bodies, which is so far different from an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid,</hi>
as to make a <hi>Luctation</hi> therewith. But to give particular instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the several <hi>Proportions,</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>Mixture,</hi> wherein it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be in several <hi>Plants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. §. And first, of all vegetable Bodies, Date-stones are amongst the
least apt to make a Luctation with Acids, if they may be said to make any at
all. <hi>Hence they are not so potent</hi> Nephriticks, <hi>as many other Stones,
which make a more sensible</hi> Luctation.</p>
                  <p>11. §. Ginger makes a small Bullition <hi>with</hi> Aqua fortis, only observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by a Glass. <hi>Hence the</hi> pungency <hi>of Ginger lyeth in a</hi> sulphureous <hi>and</hi>
volatile Salt, <hi>which yet is very little</hi> Alkalizate.</p>
                  <p>12. §. <hi>Scurvygrass-seeds make a very small Bullition with Aqua fortis,
like that of Ginger. So doth also the Seed of Purslane.</hi> Hence, although
there is much more of a certain kind of <hi>volatile Salt</hi> in Ginger or
Scurvygrass, than in <hi>Purslane;</hi> yet there is little more of an <hi>Alkaly</hi> in
any one, than in an other.</p>
                  <p>13. §. <hi>The Pulp of Colocynthis, Fruit-Stones, the stony Covers of
the Seeds of Elder, of white Bryony, of Violets, and others, with Aqua
fortis make a Bullition just perceivable without a Glass.</hi> Hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
That the great <hi>Cathartick</hi> power of <hi>Colocynthis</hi> lieth not so much
in an <hi>Alkaly,</hi> as an <hi>Acid;</hi> as making a much less <hi>Bullition,</hi> than some
other <hi>vegetable Bodies,</hi> which are less <hi>Cathartick.</hi> For which reason
likewise it is, That the best Correctors, or Refractors of the force of
<hi>Colocynthis,</hi> are some kinds of <hi>Alkalies,</hi> as particularly that of <hi>Urine,</hi>
as <hi>Riverius</hi> hath somewhere observed.</p>
                  <p>14. §. The Root of Pyrethrum, with Aqua fortis, makes a Bullition
and huff, in a short time. <hi>Hence, the Cause of a</hi> durable Heat, <hi>upon the
Tongue, is an</hi> Alkalizate Sulphur. <hi>For the Heat of Ginger, though</hi>
                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:100350:146"/>
greater; <hi>yet abideth</hi> nothing near so long <hi>as that of</hi> Pyrethrum; <hi>which,
as is said, maketh also a more sensible</hi> Bullition <hi>with</hi> Acids.</p>
                  <p>15. §. Kermes-berries, commonly, but ignorantly, so called, with the
said Liquor, huff up to an equal height, but in a somewhat longer time.
<hi>Hence they are gently</hi> astringent; scil, <hi>as their</hi> Alkaly <hi>binds in with
some preternatural</hi> Acid <hi>in the stomach.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>16. §. Hawthorn-stones, with Aqua fortis, huff up equally with the
former Body; but the Bullition is not so visible. The like is also observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Medlar-stones. <hi>Hence, as they contain a middle quantity of an</hi>
Alkaly, <hi>they are not insignificantly used against the</hi> Stone.</p>
                  <p>17. §. Seeds of Staphisagria, with Aqua fortis, make a Bullition still
more visible. But it quickly ends. <hi>This confirms what was said before,</hi>
sc. <hi>That the cause of a</hi> durable Heat <hi>is an</hi> Alkaline Sulphur; <hi>these
Seeds producing a</hi> durable Heat, <hi>as doth the Root of</hi> Pyrethrum.</p>
                  <p>18. §. The Seeds also of red Roses, Borage, and Comfrey do all with
Aqua fortis make a considerable Bullition and huff; and that very quickly.
<hi>So that amongst all Shells and Stones, those generally make the greatest</hi>
Bullition, <hi>which are the hardest and the brittlest, and so the fullest of</hi>
Salt.</p>
                  <p>19. §. <hi>Euphorbium makes a Bullition yet more considerable, with much
froth, and very quickly.</hi> From which Experiment, compared with two
of the former, it appears, That <hi>Euphorbium</hi> is not an <hi>Acid,</hi> but an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaline
Gum.</hi> As also, that the cause of its so very <hi>durable Heat,</hi> is an
<hi>alkaline Sulphur,</hi> as of <hi>Pyrethrum</hi> and <hi>Staphisagria</hi> hath been said. It
seems also hence evident, that the power of all great <hi>Sternutatories</hi>
lyeth not in their <hi>Acid,</hi> but their <hi>Alkalies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. §. <hi>The Arenulae or little stones in Pears, cluster'd round about the
Coar, with Aqua fortis, presently huff up, and make a great Bullition and
Effervescence, much greater than do any of the Bodies above-named.</hi> Whence,
although, so far as I know, they have never yet been used in <hi>Medicine;</hi>
yet it is probable, that they are a more potent and effectual <hi>Nephritick,</hi>
than any of the Bodies aforsaid, some of which are usually prescribed.
It is hence also manifest, That, according to what I have elsewere said,
for the sweetning of the Fruit and Seed,<note place="margin">Anat. <hi>of</hi> Plants, B. 1. Ch. 6.</note> the <hi>Tartareous</hi> and <hi>Alkaline</hi>
parts of the <hi>Sap,</hi> are <hi>precipitated</hi> into their Stones, stony parts, and
Shells.</p>
                  <p>21. §. <hi>The last Instance shall be in the shells of the Seeds of Milium
Solis; which not only with Aqua fortis, but some other Acids, make a
greater and quicker Bullition and Effervescence, than any other vegetable
Body, upon which I have yet made tryal, in its natural estate.</hi> Hence, as
well as from divers of the last fore-going Instances, we have a clear
confirmation of what I have, towards the beginning of this Discourse,
asserted; <hi>sc.</hi> That there is some kind of <hi>Alkaline Salt</hi> in <hi>Plants,</hi> even in
their <hi>natural estate.</hi> As also, that they are as significantly used against
the Stone, <hi>quatenus alkalizate,</hi> as <hi>Millipedes, Egg-shells,</hi> or any other
<hi>testaceous Bodies</hi> of the same strength. To these I shall subjoyn one or
two Examples of Vegetable Bodies which are more or less altered from
their <hi>natural estate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>22. §. Neither Crystals of Tartar, nor Tartar it self (although they have
some store of alkaline mixed with their acid parts) make any Effervescence
with Acids, but only with Alkalites, as Spirit of Harts-Horn, &amp;c. <hi>Hence
the</hi> calculous sediment <hi>or</hi> Arenulae <hi>in</hi> Urine, <hi>may not so properly be called
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100350:147"/>
the</hi> Tartareous part <hi>of the</hi> Vrine; <hi>the events following the mixture here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
with the aforesaid</hi> Salts, <hi>being quite contrary; as will be seen in the</hi>
Last Chapter.</p>
                  <p>23. §. <hi>Spirit of Scurvy-grass maketh no Luctation with any Acid.</hi>
Hence (as from a former Experiment was above-noted) it seems, That
there may be a kind of <hi>volatile Salt,</hi> which is neither <hi>acid,</hi> nor <hi>alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line;</hi>
such as this of <hi>Scurvygrass</hi> and other like <hi>Plants</hi> seems to be: yet
contrary to an <hi>acid;</hi> as experience shews in their efficacy against the
<hi>acid Scurvy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. §. Rectified Spirit of Wine, both with Spirit of Nitre, and with
Oil of Vitriol, severally, maketh a little Luctation. <hi>Which argues, that
there is contained, even in this Spirit, some portion of a</hi> volatile Alkaly.</p>
                  <p>25. §. Spirit of Wine, and double Aqua fortis, as the strongest is called,
make an effervescence so vehement, as plainly to boil.</p>
                  <p>26. §. Besides the vehemency hereof, there is another surprizing cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance.
For whereas all other Liquors which make an Effervescence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
will do it in any proportion assigned, although but one drop to a
thousand: these two, <hi>sc,</hi> rectified Spirit of Wine and Aqua fortis, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a certain proportion the one to the other. For if, suppose, into six
drops of Spirit of Wine you put but two or three of Aqua fortis, they stir
no more than if you put in so much Water: but drop in about seven or
eight drops of Aqua fortis, and they presently boil up with very great vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.
<hi>Hence we may conceive the reason of the sudden access of an</hi>
acute Disease, <hi>and of its</hi> Crisis. <hi>These not beginning</hi> gradually with
the Cause; <hi>but then, when the</hi> Cause <hi>is arrived unto such an</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>or
such a certain</hi> Proportion, <hi>as is necessary to bring Nature to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test.
And these may serve for Examples upon</hi> Vegetables.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING given several Instances of tryal upon
<hi>Vegetables;</hi> I next proceed to <hi>Minerals,</hi> which,
for some orders sake, I shall distribute into five
or six sorts, <hi>sc. Earths, Stones Ores</hi> and <hi>Metals,
Sulphurs,</hi> and <hi>Salts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. §. First for Earths. Oyl of Vitriol upon
Fullers Earth, doth not stir it, or cause the least
Bullition. Nor upon yellow Oker. Nor upon the
Oker which falls from green Vitriol. The same
Oyl of Vitriol and Spirit of Harts-Horn poured severally upon Bolus Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena
of two kinds, and upon one kind of Terra sigillata, stir none of
them. <hi>Hence</hi> Bolus'<hi>s are the</hi> Beds, <hi>or as it were, the</hi> Materia prima,
<hi>both of opacous</hi> Stones, <hi>and</hi> Metals; <hi>into which the said</hi> Bolus'<hi>s are
transmuted, by being</hi> concentred <hi>with divers kinds of</hi> Salts <hi>and</hi> Sulphurs,
<hi>which successively flow in upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:100350:147"/>
3. §. <hi>Aqua fortis, and Oyl of Vitriol being poured severally upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sealed Earth, which was vended by the name of Terra Lemnia; they
both made a very considerable Effervescence herewith.</hi> Whence it appears,
That there is no small difference in the nature, and therefore the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Bolus Armena</hi> and <hi>Terra Lemnia.</hi> As also, betwixt the sealed
Earths themselves, one making a great <hi>Effervescence,</hi> another none at
all. Whereto those that use them, are to have regard.</p>
                  <p>4. §. <hi>Next for Stones. And first, Irish Slat, with Spirit of Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,
maketh a small, yet visible Bullition: and it presently ceaseth.</hi> So
that it seems to be nothing else but a <hi>Vitriolick Bole.</hi> As is also argued
from its taste, which is plainly acid, and somewhat rough. Whence
also it is with good reason given upon any inward Bruises. Because
by coagulating the Blood, it prohibits its too copious afflux into the
affected part. Yet being but gently astringent, and so the Coagulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
it makes, not great; they are likewise well enough carried off from
the same part in the Circulation; by both which means an Inflammation
may be either prevented, or the better over-ruled.</p>
                  <p>5. §. Lapis Haematites maketh no Effervescence at all either with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies
or Acids.</p>
                  <p>6. §. Powder of the green part of a Magnet with Oyl of Vitriol ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
some few bubbles, yet not visible without a Glass. But the powder of
the black part of a Magnet, which is the said stone fully perfect, stirreth
not with any acid. Neither doth the calcined Magnet. <hi>Hence there is
some considerable difference betwixt</hi> Iron <hi>and the</hi> Magnet.</p>
                  <p>7. §. <hi>Lapis Lazuli, with Oil of Vitriol, and especially with Spirit of
Nitre, maketh a conspicuous Bullition.</hi> Hence its <hi>Cathartick</hi> virtue lyeth
in an <hi>Alkaly.</hi> For which reason it is also appropriate, in like manner
as <hi>Steel,</hi> to the cure of <hi>Hypochondriacal Affections;</hi> originated from
some kind of fermenting Acid.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Osteocolla, with Spirit of Nitre maketh yet a greater Effervescence.</hi>
How it comes to be so great a knitter of broken Bones, as it is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
is obscure. It seemeth, that upon its solution by a <hi>Nitrous Acid</hi>
in the body; it is <hi>precipitated</hi> upon the broken part, and so becomes a
kind of <hi>Cement</hi> thereto.</p>
                  <p>9. §. Lapis Tuthiae, with Spirit of Nitre, maketh an Effervescence
much alike. And with Oyl of Vitriol very considerably. But Lapis Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaris
with Oyl of Vitriol grows stark; as the powder of Alabaster doth
with water. With Spirit of Nitre it maketh a little Bullition, and quickly.
But with Aqua fortis, a great one; beyond any of the Stones above named.
<hi>Hence both</hi> Tufty <hi>and</hi> Calamy <hi>are</hi> Ophthalmicks <hi>from their</hi> Alkaly.
<hi>Which is also consirmed, from the efficacy of some</hi> Alkalies <hi>of the like
use. Hence also</hi> Calamy <hi>seemeth to partake somewhat of the nature of</hi>
Silver: <hi>as by tryal made upon that also, will hereafter better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. §. Chalk and Oil of Sulphur or Vitriol make as strong an Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescence
as any of the rest. <hi>Whence it is sometimes well used against a
Cardialgia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. §. <hi>Whiting makes as great an Effervescence as Chalk.</hi> So that it
seems the saline parts are not washed away with the water, wherein
the Chalk, for the making of Whiting, is dissolved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:100350:148"/>
12. §. Talk will not stir in the least either with Spirit of Nitre, or
Oyl of Vitriol. But the Lead-Spar maketh a considerable Effervescence with
both of them severally. <hi>Hence, however this be also called</hi> English Talk,
<hi>yet there is no small difference betwixt this, and true</hi> Talk.</p>
                  <p>13. §. To these Stones may be added petrified bodies. As petrified wood;
which (that upon which I made tryal) no acid stirreth in the least. Petrified
shells; upon four or five several sorts whereof, Oyl of Vitriol being poured,
preduceth a great Effervescence. The Root or rougher part of the Stone called
<hi>Glossopetra,</hi> with Spirit of Nitre, makes a conspicuous Bullition. <hi>Aste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
the Stone so called, and found in some places in <hi>England,</hi> with Oyl of
Vitriol, maketh an Effervescence at the same degree. So doth the Belem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
or Thunder-Stone, both the larger and the lesser kinds. <hi>So that
none of these are</hi> acid, <hi>or</hi> vitriolick, <hi>but</hi> alkalizate <hi>Stones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. §. Coraline, with Oyl of Vitriol, makes a conspicuous Bullition,
yet mild and gentle; that is, with very little, if any heat, and without
any visible Fumes. And red and white Coral do the like. <hi>Hence they
are all of a very gentle operation, and fit for Children, as the case re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. §. <hi>Magistery of Coral (prepared the ordinary way) stirreth not
in the least, either with Alkalies or Acids.</hi> Whence it is evident, That its
active Principles are in its preparation destroyed and washed away:
that is to say, It is an elaborate Medicine good for nothing. And thus
far of Stones.</p>
                  <p>16. §. I next come to Metals and Ores. And first for Lead; upon which
Spirit of Salt Spirit of Nitre, or Aqua fortis being dropped, it stirreth not
in the least with any of them: but with Oyl of Sulphur, and especially with
Oyl of Vitriol it maketh a slow Bullition and froth. <hi>Hence it seemeth to be</hi>
the most alkalizate Metal. <hi>Which is also confirmed by a foregoing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
upon the</hi> Lead-Spar, <hi>which maketh a considerable Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescence
with any sort of</hi> acid. <hi>And which likewise, being calcined,
yieldeth a good quantity of</hi> Lixivial Salt.</p>
                  <p>17. §. Lead-Ore stirreth not at all with Aqua fortis or Oil of Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol.
But Spirit of Salt makes it bubble, and Spirit of Nitre makes it boil.
<hi>Hence there is a considerable difference betwixt the perfect Metal and
the Ore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. §. Burnt Lead and red Lead, make a very small Bullition with
Oyl of Vitriol, with Spirit of Nitre a far greater.</p>
                  <p>19. §. Mercury, with Oyl of Vitriol, will not stir, nor with Oyl of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur.
But with Spirit of Nitre presently boyls up. <hi>Hence</hi> Mercury <hi>is a</hi>
subacid Metal; Spirit <hi>of</hi> Nitre <hi>being a</hi> subalkaline Acid.</p>
                  <p>20. §. The filings of Iron or Steel, with Oyl of Vitriol, make a fair
Bullition, like that of Minium. But Spirit of Nitre makes them boil with
much c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lerity. <hi>Hence Iron is likewise a</hi> subacid Metal.</p>
                  <p>21. §. <hi>Steel prepared with Sulphur maketh a far less Effervescence
with the same Spirit of Nitre, than do the filings.</hi> Hence there is a great
difference in their strength. So that ten grains of the filings unprepared,
will go as far as fifteen grains or more of those which are prepared,
as above-said. Yet in some cases the weaker and milder may be the
better.</p>
                  <p>22. §. There is one Circumstance in the mixture of Steel and Aqua
fortis, which is surprizing; and that is this, That strong Aqua fortis,
dropped upon Steel, will not, of it self, make the least Bullition: but if
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:100350:148"/>
hereto you only add a drop or two of Water, they presently boil up with very
great vehemency. <hi>The Cause is obscure; yet it is well known, that</hi>
Water <hi>it self will dissolve</hi> Iron: <hi>so that it appeas, as well by this, as
by some other Experiments, that even in common Water, as mild as it
is, there is some kind of corrosive Principle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>23. §. Antimony with Spirit of Nitre, and Aqua fortis severally,
maketh an Effervescence; somewhat lower than Iron. With Oil of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol
the Bullition is so small, as difficulty to be perceived with a Glass.
<hi>Hence it seemeth to be of a very compounded nature; if I may so call
it, a subacid-alkaline Metal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. §. Antimonium Diaphoreticum, with Spirit of Nitre and Oil
of Vitriol severally, makes a considerable Effervescence. <hi>Wherefore it is
not an useless</hi> Preparation; <hi>as from the</hi> Calcination <hi>and</hi> Ablution <hi>used
therein, some have thought.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>25. §. Bezoardicum Minerale, (that upon which I made tryal)
stirreth not at all either with Alkalies or Acids. <hi>To which, let those
who make use of it, have regard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>26. §. Tin, with Spirit of Nitre, makes so hot and vehement an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fervescence,
that it turns presently, as it were, into a Coal. It makes
also a fair Bullition with Oyl of Vitriol. And a gentle one with Spirit
of Salt. <hi>Wherefore, it hath something of the nature both of</hi> Iron,
Lead, <hi>and</hi> Copper.</p>
                  <p>27. §. The like remarkable circumstance is seen in the mixture of
Aqua fortis with Tin, as with Iron. For Tin and strong Aqua fortis
of themselves will not stir; but add a few drops of water to them, and
they boyl up with the greatest vehemency.</p>
                  <p>28. §. Copper, with Spirit of Salt, and Oyl of Vitriol severally, stirs
not at all. Spirit of Nitre, and Aqua fortis, both boil it up vehemently.
Neither Spirit of Harts-horn, nor Spirit of Salt Armoniac maketh any Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
therewith. But both of them, by a gentle solution, that is, gently
separating its Sulphur from its Salts, turn it blue. <hi>Hence</hi> Copper <hi>hath
a greater proportion of</hi> acid <hi>than</hi> any <hi>of the formentioned</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>
                  <p>29. §. Silver, neither with Spirit of Salt, nor Oyl of Vitriol makes any
Bullition. With Spirit of Nitre it makes one, but tis soon over: and then
continues to dissolve slowly into white Coagulations. It also maketh with
Spirit of Harts-horn, or of Salt Armoniac, a full and deep blue. <hi>Hence
there is a greater proportion of</hi> acid <hi>in</hi> Silver, <hi>than in</hi> Lead, Mercury,
Iron, Antimony, Tin, <hi>or</hi> Copper.</p>
                  <p>30. §. Litharge of Silver maketh the greatest Effervescence with Oyl
of Vitriol. Yet some with Spirit of Nitre. And with Spirit of Salt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac
maketh some little huff or elevation. And being mixed with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Nitre and Spirit of Salt Armoniac both together, produceth a faint
blue. <hi>Hence, although the far greater part of this</hi> Litharge <hi>be but</hi>
Lead; <hi>yet, it seems, it hath some small mixture of</hi> Silver. <hi>But that
of</hi> Gold <hi>seemeth, for contrary reasons, not to have any</hi> Gold.</p>
                  <p>31. §. Gold maketh no Effervescence with any single Salt I know of.
But it is commonly dissolved with Aqua Regis, which is known to be an
alkaline Liquor. <hi>Whence it seemeth, That as</hi> Lead <hi>is the</hi> most alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizate,
<hi>so</hi> Gold <hi>the</hi> most acid <hi>of</hi> Metals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:100350:149"/>
32. §. These things considered, and other observations added here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
may possibly give some directions, not only for the ordering and
using, but even for the making, imitating and transmuting of <hi>Metals.</hi>
Thus far of <hi>Metals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>33. §. I will next give one or two Instances of tryal upon Sulphurs.
And first Sulphur vive, with Aqua fortis, maketh an apparent Bullition,
but it is some time, before it begins. But the factitious or common Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stene,
maketh scarce any, if any at all. <hi>So that there is no small dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>34. §. <hi>White and yellow Arsenick make no Bullition either with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies
or Acids.</hi> Wherefore the strength of its operation on the Body,
lies more in a <hi>Sulphur</hi> than a <hi>Salt;</hi> or in a <hi>Salt</hi> drowned in its <hi>Sulphure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>35. §. The ashes either of Pit-Coal, or Sea-Coal, make no Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescence
with Alkalies or Acids. <hi>Whence the saline Principle is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
volatile, and sublimed away by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>36. §. Lastly for Salts. And first of all, Borax maketh no Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescence
nor any Fumes with Oyl of Vitriol or Spirit of Nitre.</p>
                  <p>37. §. Oyl of Vitriol and Nitre make fumes or steams, though no
Effervescence.</p>
                  <p>38. §. Green Vitriol, with Spirit of Harts-Horn, is scarcely moved.
White Vitriol, with the same Spirit, maketh a conspicuous huff. And Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Vitriol a vehement Effervescence. <hi>Whence the</hi> former <hi>is the</hi> least
acid, <hi>and the</hi> latter the most of all. <hi>Which also confirms what I said
before of the like natures of the several</hi> Metals <hi>to which they belong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>39. §. Salt of Vitriol, though a fixed Salt, and made by Calcination,
yet maketh no Effervescence with the strongest acid; but only with Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
as may be seen upon their mixture, but much better heard by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the mixture to ones ear. <hi>Hence, there are</hi> fixed Acids. <hi>Which
further confirms what I have above asserted concerning the nature of</hi>
Gold, sc. <hi>That the</hi> predominant Salt <hi>thereof is a</hi> fixed Acid.</p>
                  <p>40. §. Sal Martis, with Spirit of Harts-horn, maketh a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
huff. <hi>Hence it is much more</hi> acid <hi>than</hi> green Vitriol; <hi>and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a cooler body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>41. §. Alum and Spirit of Harts-horn make a plain Effervescence.</p>
                  <p>42. §. Saccharum Saturni, with Oyl of Vitriol, stirs not at all.
With Spirit of Salt, huffs a little. With Spirit of Nitre much more.
<hi>Hence the</hi> acid <hi>of the</hi> Vinegar, <hi>and not the</hi> Alkaly <hi>of the</hi> Lead, <hi>is the
predominnt Principle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>43. §. Common Salt stirs neither with Spirit of Salt, nor with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Nitre; nor with Aqua fortis. But with Oyl of Vitriol it maketh
a great Effervescence with noise and steams. <hi>Hence, even common Salt,
though it be not reckoned amongst</hi> alkaline Salts, <hi>yet is far nerer in
nature to</hi> that, <hi>than to an</hi> acid. <hi>Hence also the</hi> Spirit <hi>of</hi> Salt <hi>is a</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alkaline
Acid, <hi>and of a very different nature from</hi> Oyl <hi>of</hi> Sulphur <hi>or</hi>
Vitriol.</p>
                  <p>44. §. Salt Armoniac, with Spirit of Nitre, stirreth not. But
with Oyl of Vitriol it maketh a great Effervescence. <hi>Hence</hi> Spirit of
Nitre <hi>is a</hi> subalkalizate Spirit.</p>
                  <p>45. §. Oyl of Vitriol and Spirit of Nitre, though both acids, yet make
a great smoak; greater than that which the Spirit maketh of it self.
<hi>Which confirms the last precedent</hi> Corollary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:100350:149"/>
46. §. Oyl of Vitriol and Spirit of Salt, though both acids, yet
make a strong Effervesence, with noise and fumes. <hi>Which further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
what was noted before,</hi> sc. <hi>that Spirit of Salt is a</hi> subalkaline
Acid.</p>
                  <p>47. §. Spirit of Salt Armoniac, with Oyl of Vitriol, makes an Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescence
so extraordinary quick, and as it were instaneous, that nothing
seemeth quicker. <hi>Whence it is probable, That if</hi> Gun-Powder <hi>were
made of</hi> Salt Armoniac, <hi>instead of</hi> Nitre, <hi>or with</hi> both <hi>mixed together;
it would be</hi> far stronger, <hi>than any kind now in use. And thus far for</hi>
Minerals.</p>
                  <p>48. §. I have only one <hi>Corollary</hi> to add, from the whole; which
is, That whoever doth undertake the <hi>Natural History</hi> of a <hi>Country,</hi>
(such as that the Learned Dr. <hi>Plot</hi> hath exceedingly well done of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire)</hi>
the foregoing <hi>Method,</hi> seemeth so easie, cheap, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful,
for the finding out and well distinguishing the natures of all
kinds of <hi>Metalls, Ores, Salts, Earths, Stones,</hi> or other <hi>subterraneal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi>
as cannot, I think, be supply'd, but by others of greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and expence.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. What may be observed of the PARTS of Animals.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> NOW proceed to the several</hi> Parts <hi>of</hi> Animals; <hi>as</hi>
Hairs, Hoofs, Horns, Shells <hi>and</hi> shelly Insects, Bones,
Flesh and the several Viscera, Silk, Blood, Eggs, Musk,
Castor, Gall, Urine, Dungs, Salts and Stones.</p>
                  <p>2. §. And first of all, the Hair of a mans head,
with Oyl of Vitriol, maketh no Bullition at all. Nor
yet with Spirit of Nitre. <hi>So that although it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a good deal of</hi> volatile Salt; <hi>yet it seemeth either not to be</hi> alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,
<hi>or else is</hi> centred <hi>in so great a quantity of</hi> Oyl, <hi>that the</hi> acid men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum
<hi>cannot reach it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. §, <hi>Hares Fur, with spirit of Nitre, maketh, although a short, yet
very plain Bullition and huff.</hi> Hence the <hi>Hair,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Blood,</hi>
of some <hi>Animals,</hi> is fuller of <hi>Salt,</hi> at least of an <hi>Alkaline Salt,</hi> than
that of some others. And perhaps the <hi>Hair</hi> of some men, as of <hi>Black's,</hi>
may be so full of <hi>Salt,</hi> as to make a Bullition like <hi>Hares Fur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. §. The shavings of Nails stir not at all, either with Oyl of Vitriol,
or Spirit of Nitre: only with the latter they turn yellow. But Elks Claws,
with Spirit of Nitre, make a small and slow Bullition.</p>
                  <p>5. §. Horses Hoof, with Oyl of Vitriol, stirs not of many hours. But
with Spirit of Nitre, allowing it some time, makes a very plain Bullition,
and huffs up very high.</p>
                  <p>6. §. Cows Horn, neither with Oyl of Vitriol, nor with Spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
maketh any Bullition, only turneth to a yellow colour.</p>
                  <p>7. §. Rams Horn stirs not with Oyl of Vitriol; but with Spirit of
Nitre, makes a small and slow Bullition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:100350:150"/>
8. §. <hi>Harts-Horn makes a considerable Bullition and huff, even with
Oyl of Vitriol, which the rest of the Bodies abovesaid, will not do. But
with Spirit of Nitre, it makes yet a greater.</hi> From the foregoing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
and almost all that follow, what is before asserted of
the <hi>Salts</hi> of <hi>Vegetables</hi> and <hi>Minerals,</hi> is here also evident concerning that
of <hi>Animals, scil.</hi> That it is not <hi>made,</hi> but only <hi>separated</hi> by the fire.
It likewise hence appears, That the <hi>proportion</hi> of <hi>Salt</hi> in the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<hi>parts</hi> is very different; and that therefore some of them are never,
and none of them but with good discretion, to be substituted one for
another in Medicine. As also, that there is a different proportion of
<hi>Salt</hi> in the several <hi>Animals</hi> themselves, to which the said <hi>Parts</hi> belong.</p>
                  <p>9. §. Next for shells; as those of Lobsters, Eggs, Snails and Oisters:
all which make an Effervescence, both with Oyl of Vitriol, and Spirit of
tre. But with Spirit of Nitre the greatest. Lobster-shells make a considerable
Bullition and huff, but no noise nor steams. Egg-shells make a Bullition and
huff, with some noise, but no steams. Snail-shells make an Effervescence
with noise and steams. Oyster-shells make one with the greatest noise and
thickest steams. <hi>Hence we may judge, in what case to administer</hi> one
<hi>more appositely than</hi> another. <hi>As also</hi> in what proportion, <hi>according to
their different strength. Some may be better for</hi> Children, <hi>as being
milder. Or for a Body whose very sharp</hi> Blood <hi>or other</hi> Humors, <hi>are
more easily kindled into</hi> Ferments. <hi>Or else may be safest, to avoid a
sudden</hi> precipitation <hi>of the</hi> Humors; <hi>or for some other cause.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. §. Oyster-shells, and the rest above-said, make a quicker Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescence,
not only with Spirit of Nitre, but even with Spirit of Salt, than
they do with Oyl of Sulphur, or Oyl of Vitriol. <hi>So that</hi> these bodies, <hi>as
well as</hi> Metals, <hi>have their proper</hi> menstruums <hi>whereby they are be
dissolved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. §. Egg-shells calcined, make with Oyl of Sulphur, or Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
or Spirit of Nitre, a greater Effervescence, than when uncalcined.
As also with steams, which uncalcined, they produce not. The like is
seen in calcined Oyster-shells. And the longer the Calcination is continued,
the quicker and stronger will be the Effervescence. This I tryed at several
terms, from a quarter of an hour, to five hours. So that after so long a
Calcination, they make an Effervesence almost instantaneous. <hi>The reason
hereof is, Because the several</hi> Principles <hi>whereof the</hi> Shells <hi>consist, being
relaxed, and the</hi> Sulphur <hi>for the greatest part, driven away by the fire;
the remaining</hi> Salt <hi>lies now more open and naked to the attaque of the</hi>
Menstruum, <hi>so soon as ever they are mixed together. From hence it is
plain, That</hi> Egg-shells, <hi>and the others above-said, being</hi> burnt, <hi>are far</hi>
stronger <hi>Medicines, than when</hi> unburnt. <hi>It is hereby likewise evident,
That a great portion of their</hi> Salt, <hi>is not a</hi> volatile, <hi>but a</hi> fixed Alkaly.
<hi>To these may be subjoyned all kinds of shelly</hi> Insects. <hi>I will instance
in three or four.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. §. And first Bees, with Oyl of Vitriol, stir not in the least. With
Spirit of Nitre they make an exceeding small Bullition, without any eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>13. §. Cochinele <hi>(the</hi> Nest <hi>of an</hi> Insect) makes some Bullition with
Oyl of Vitriol, but very small: for the bubbles are not to be seen without a
Glass. But with Spirit of Nitre the Bullition is more visible, and joyned
with some elevation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:100350:150"/>
14. §. <hi>Cantharides make no visible Bullition with Oyl of Vitriol.
But with Spirit of Nitre they do, and huff up rather more than Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinele.
Yet is this done very slowly, and comparatively with many other
bodies, is not much.</hi> Hence it is not the <hi>quantity,</hi> but the <hi>quality</hi>
of their <hi>volatile Salt,</hi> which makes them so strong an <hi>Epispastick.</hi>
For most of those Bodies above, and hereafter named, make a
greater <hi>Bullition,</hi> and yet are neither <hi>Caustick</hi> nor <hi>Epispastick</hi> in the
least. It is hence also evident, as hath been before suggested, That
there are divers kinds of <hi>volatile Salts,</hi> eminently different; some
being highly <hi>alkaline,</hi> others very <hi>little,</hi> and some scarce any thing
so: such as those of <hi>Scurvy-grass, Anemone, Crow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oot,</hi> and many the
like <hi>Plants;</hi> to whose <hi>Salts,</hi> this of <hi>Cantharides</hi> seemeth to be very
near of kin.</p>
                  <p>15. §. Millepedes make a Bullition and huff, much greater and quicker,
than any of the Insects above-named: and that both with Spirit of Nitre,
and Oyl of Vitriol it self. Yet is this Insect of a very temperate nature.
<hi>Whereby is further demonstrated, That the being</hi> simply alkaline, <hi>is not
enough to make a body to be</hi> Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>stick.</p>
                  <p>16. §. Again, although Millepedes make a Bullition, greater than any
of the Insects above named: yet is it much less, than that of Oyster, Snail,
or even Egg-shells; and of divers other bodies above, and hereafter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
<hi>Hence, being given to the same intent, as any of those bodies;
it is the mildest and gentlest in its operation of them all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. §. Millepedes likewise calcined, makes a stronger Effervescence,
than when uncalcined, as do the Oyster-shells, &amp;c. <hi>So that it appears,
That</hi> all Testaceous Salts, <hi>are at least in part,</hi> fixed Salts.</p>
                  <p>18. §. I next proceed to Bones. And first Whale-bone maketh no
Bullition at all with any acid. A Cartilage, with Spirit of Nitre, makes
some very small bubbles, not to be seen without a Glass.</p>
                  <p>19. §. The Bone in the Throat of a Carp, makes a little and slow Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
with Spirit of Nitre. The Spina of a Fish (that which I used was of
a Cod-fish) maketh a Bullition one degree higher.</p>
                  <p>20. §. All sorts of Teeth, as Dogs, Boars, the Sea-horse, Elephant,
make the like. As also the Bone of an Oxes heart. <hi>So that all these are
very gentle in their operation, and fit for</hi> Children.</p>
                  <p>21. §. Sheeps and Calves Bones both of them make a Bullition yet a
little higher, especially with Spirit of Nitre. Cocks Bones somewhat higher
than the former. Cranium humanum a little higher than all the rest.</p>
                  <p>22. §. Bones likewise, being calcined, make a Bullition with Acids.
And so doth also calcined Harts-Horn. But in neither of them, is the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
advanced by Calcination, any thing comparable to what it is in shells.
<hi>Whence it appears, That the</hi> Salt <hi>of</hi> Horns <hi>and</hi> Bones, <hi>is much more</hi>
volatile, <hi>than that of</hi> shells.</p>
                  <p>23. §. Next for Flesh and the several Viscera. And first, dryed
and powdered Mutton, with Oil of Vitriol, stirs not at all. But with
Spirit of Nitre makes a small Bullition and huff. Sheeps Heart doth the
like somewhat more apparently. Vipers flesh produceth a froth, but huffs
not, Powdered Earthsworms make a great froth, and huff a little. Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Tripe makes only a little Bullition. Lamb-stones do the like. Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
Spleen, and Liver, with some elevation. Lungs, with bubbles very
large; because extraordinary slowly. Dryed Brain makes also a little

                     <hi>and slow Bullition.</hi> Hence there is a greater proportion of <hi>Sulphur</hi>
or <hi>Oyl,</hi> and less of <hi>an Alkaly in all these parts,</hi> than there is in <hi>Bones,
Shells,</hi> and divers other <hi>parts</hi> hereafter mentioned. And in some of
them, as in the <hi>Brain,</hi> that <hi>Alkaline Salt</hi> which there is, may rather be
lodged in some <hi>sanguineous</hi> parts mixed with them, than in their own
proper substance.</p>
                  <p>24. §. <hi>I proceed to instance in all sorts of Animal</hi> Contents. And
first, raw Silk, with Spirit of Nitre, makes a very small Bullition, but
the elevation is considerable.</p>
                  <p>25. §. The grumous pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t of the Blood dryed, with Oyl of Vitriol,
stirs but little. But with Spirit of Nitre it huffs up considerably.</p>
                  <p>26. §. Seram of Blood dryed, with the same Spirit makes a plain
elevation, with a little Bullition. Herewith may be re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>koned the White
of an Egg, which is nothing but a pure Crystalline Serum separated from the
common stock. This being dryed, with Spirit of Nitre, huffs up rather
more than even the grumous part of the Blood, the Bubbles are much larger,
break oftner, and the elevation sooner made. <hi>Whence it seemeth, that
there is a greater quantity of a</hi> volatile Alkaly <hi>in proportion to the</hi>
Sulphur, <hi>requisite to the</hi> Generation, <hi>than to the</hi> Nutrition <hi>of an</hi>
Animal.</p>
                  <p>27. §. The Yelk of an Egg is scarce moved with Spirit of Nitre, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
only a very few Bubbles. <hi>The</hi> Salt <hi>being either little</hi> alkalizate,
<hi>or else</hi> immersed <hi>in so great a quantity of</hi> Oyl, <hi>that the</hi> Menstruum <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reach it.</hi> For the same reason Sperma Ceti stirs not with any Acid.
Neither doth Civet.</p>
                  <p>28 §. Russian Castor, with Oyl of Vitriol, stirs not. But with
Spirit of Nitre makes a considerable huff and froth. Yet it requires time.
<hi>Wherefore it seemeth, That</hi> Castor <hi>by virtue of its</hi> alkaline Sulphur,
<hi>becomes so good a</hi> Corrector <hi>of the</hi> acid alkaline Sulphur <hi>of</hi> Opium: <hi>so
I take leave to call it, having some reasons to believe it such.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>29. §. Musk, with Oyl of Vitriol, stirs not. But with Spirit of
Nitre it makes a considerable and quick Bullition, with large bubbles,
which often break and rise again. <hi>Whence there is a very eminent dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt</hi> Musk <hi>and</hi> Civet. <hi>Hence also,</hi> Musk <hi>is Cordial, not
only from its</hi> Sulphur, <hi>but its</hi> Alkaly; <hi>by both directly opposite to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural</hi>
Acidities.</p>
                  <p>30. §. <hi>Dryed Gall with Spirit of Nitre, for some time, is still: but
at length it makes a considerable Bullition and froth.</hi> The reason why
it is so long before it begins, is because the <hi>Salt,</hi> (as was observed of
some other <hi>Parts)</hi> is locked up in so great a quantity of <hi>Oyl.</hi> The
abundance whereof is manifest, not only from <hi>Destillation,</hi> but also
from hence, In that the dryed <hi>Powder,</hi> in lying by, incorporateth all
together into one body, as <hi>Mirrh,</hi> and some other softer and oily <hi>Gums</hi>
are used to do.</p>
                  <p>31. §. Extract of Vrine, with Spirit of Nitre, makes a Bullition
with some Effervescence, which continues for a considerable time; and at
last it huffs up with great bubbles. The Bullition begins presently: the
Salt being copious, and the Oyl but little.</p>
                  <p>32. §. <hi>The same Extract of Urine makes a considerable Bullition and
fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>th not only with Spirit of Nitre, but even with Oyl of Vitriol.</hi> Hence
the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Urine</hi> is more <hi>alkaline</hi> than that in most of the afore-said
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:100350:151"/>
                     <hi>Contents.</hi> From this and some of the following <hi>Experiments,</hi> it also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
That the <hi>Salt</hi> which concurs to the generation of <hi>Gravel</hi> or of
a <hi>Stone</hi> in the <hi>Kidneys</hi> or <hi>Bladder,</hi> is of a very different nature from the
<hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Urine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>33. §. Next for Dungs. And first, dryed Goats-dung makes with
Spirit of Nitre, a small Bullition, but no elevation. That of Mice the
like. And that of Cows. So that of all I have tryed, these three stir the
least.</p>
                  <p>34. §. Goose-dung, with Spirit of Nitre, makes a very small Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and some elevation. But it requires time. Oyl of Vitriol stirs it
not.</p>
                  <p>35. §. Album Graecum, with Spirit of Nitre, besides immerable
small bubbles, rises up with some great ones, exactly resembling the huffing
up of Yest or Barm. Also with Oyl of Vitriol it maketh some little froth,
but slowly. <hi>So that it should seem, that the</hi> Bones <hi>are a little</hi> opened <hi>by
some</hi> acid Menstruum <hi>in the Dogs stomach (as the body of</hi> Steel <hi>is in its
preparation with</hi> Sulphur) <hi>whereby it becomes a good mild</hi> Topick <hi>in</hi>
Quinzies.</p>
                  <p>36. §. Hens dung, with Spirit of Nitre, makes a very great bullition
and huff: greater and quicker, than any of the rest above-named.</p>
                  <p>37. §. <hi>But of all I have tryed, Pigeons dung, with the same Spirit,
maketh the greatest and the quickest Effervescence and huff; and that not
without steams. Yet neither the same Dung, nor that of Hens, is moved
in the least with Oyl of Vitriol.</hi> The Cause of so great an <hi>Effervescence</hi>
in these, more than in the rest, is that <hi>white part</hi> which is here mixed
in a great quantity with the <hi>Dung.</hi> Which <hi>white part,</hi> descendeth
not from the <hi>Stomach,</hi> but is an <hi>Excrement</hi> separated from the <hi>Blood</hi>
(as the <hi>Urine</hi> in other <hi>Animals)</hi> by a peculiar <hi>Organ,</hi> which evacuates
it into the <hi>Intestinum rectum;</hi> whence, together with the <hi>Stercus</hi> it is
excluded. Hence it is evident, That in the said <hi>white part</hi> of <hi>Hens,</hi>
and especially <hi>Pigeons dung,</hi> is contained a great quantity of a <hi>vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Alkaly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>38. §. I proceed to Salts. And first Salt of Blood and Vrine both
make a more durable Effervescence with Acids, than doth Salt of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
or Salt of Fern. <hi>Hence the former are more</hi> alkaline, <hi>than
the latter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>39. §. Again, though divers other Animal Salts will not stir with
Spirit of Salt, or with Oyl of Sulphur or Vitriol; yet the Salt of Blood
will make an Effervescence with all kinds of Acids. <hi>Whence it is further
argued to be highly</hi> alkaline, <hi>and very proper for the</hi> correction, <hi>of
all sorts of</hi> preternatural Acids <hi>in the body. There is little doubt, but
that</hi> Spirit <hi>of</hi> Harts-horn <hi>will do the like.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>40. §. The Gravel which is precipitated out of Vrine; with Oyl of
Vitriol makes no bullition in the least. Nor with strong Spirit of Salt. But
with Spirit of Nitre, it makes a very great one, with Effervescence and
steams. <hi>From hence it appears, That there is much difference to be
made in the use of</hi> acid Diureticks, Nephriticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>41. §. And that I may not altogether omit to mention, what may
be so much for the good of mankind, I do here declare, That for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
(I say not, the breaking, but preventing) the generation of
the <hi>Stone,</hi> either in the <hi>Kidneys,</hi> or in the <hi>Bladder,</hi> there are not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100350:152"/>
                     <hi>Medicines</hi> in the world, than some certain <hi>Preparations</hi> of <hi>Nitre,</hi>
duly administred. Whoever shall think that any kind of <hi>acid,</hi> as <hi>Oyl
of Sulphur, Oyl of Vitriol, Spirit of Salt,</hi> or the like, will have the same
effects, will find themselves much deceived in their practice.</p>
                  <p>42. §. I conclude with Stones. And first, Spirit of Nitre droped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Stone of the Kidneys or Bladder, produceth the very same effect, as
upon the Gravel in Vrine. That is to say, it makes it boil and huff up,
until at length it is perfectly dissolved into a soft Pulp; which neither Oyl
of Sulphur, nor Oyl of Vitriol, nor Spirit of Salt will do; nor give the least
touch towards its dissolution. <hi>This confirms what I said before of the
use of</hi> Nitre <hi>and</hi> Nitrous Spirits, <hi>if duly prepared and administred, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
any other</hi> Acids, <hi>against the breeding of the</hi> Stone.</p>
                  <p>43. §. Pearls, with any Acid, make the like Effervescence, as do Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-shells.
But Magistery of Pearls, as usually prepared, stirs not at all,
with any Alkaly or Acid. <hi>So that as to the effect frequently intended by
it, it is very insignificant; as of that of</hi> Corals <hi>hath been said.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>44. §. Crabs Eyes, with any Acid, make an Effervescence, almost as
quick as that of Oyster-shells.</p>
                  <p>45. Crabs Eyes likewise calcined, make a stronger Effervesnence, than
when uncalcined. <hi>So that</hi> these, <hi>as well as</hi> Shells, <hi>contain a</hi> fixed
Alkaly.</p>
                  <p>46. §. The Stones in Whitings heads make a strong Effervescence
like that of Oyster-shells.</p>
                  <p>47. §. Stone of humane Gall, stirs not with Oyl of Vitriol. But with
Spirit of Nitre maketh a little bullition just upon mixing, and after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
time, a little forth. Much less than what was observed before of
the Gall it self. <hi>So that it seemeth to be generated of the</hi> Gall coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<hi>by some</hi> Acid, <hi>which hath already</hi> refracted <hi>the</hi> Alkaly <hi>wherewith
the</hi> Gall <hi>abounds. This confirms the use of those</hi> Medicines <hi>in the</hi> Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<hi>or any other bordering</hi> Disease, <hi>which destroys those</hi> Acidities
<hi>by which the</hi> Gall <hi>is</hi> curdled <hi>or</hi> coagulated, <hi>and so rendred more
difficulty separable into the</hi> Guts.</p>
                  <p>48. §. Since the first publishing of these Observations, Mr. <hi>William
Matthews</hi> an <hi>Apothecary</hi> in <hi>Ledbury,</hi> sent me part, as I take it, of a
<hi>Stomach-stone,</hi> as big as a <hi>Wallnut</hi> of the largest Size, voided by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
about 82 years of age, sometime after an <hi>Autumn Fever.</hi> It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
of the same <hi>Striae,</hi> as the <hi>Bezoar Stone;</hi> and maketh some <hi>Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
with <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>49. §. Bezoar, neither the Western nor the Eastern, doth stir at all
with Oyl of Vitriol.</p>
                  <p>50. §. Western Bezoar, with Spirit of Nitre, makes a very little thin
froth, and that's all; and that it doth very slowly. But Oriental Bezoar,
with Spirit of Nitre, after some time, maketh a very great Effervescence,
froth, elevation, noise, and steams (as if you poured Oyl of Vitriol upon Salt
of Tartar) till it be wholly dissolved by the affufed Spirit, and turned into
almost a blood-red. <hi>Hence it may seem to be no mean</hi> Remedy <hi>against
such</hi> fretting <hi>and</hi> venenate acids, <hi>as oftentimes in</hi> Fevers, <hi>and other</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper,
<hi>lye about the</hi> Stomach, <hi>and are thence frequently translated
to the</hi> Heart, Brain, Nerves, <hi>and other</hi> parts. <hi>The difference likewise</hi>
betwixt the Western <hi>and the</hi> Eastern Bezoar, <hi>is so great, that in any
case of danger, and where the</hi> Bezoar <hi>is relyed upon, it is an unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:100350:152"/>
fault, for the</hi> Apothecary, <hi>or any</hi> Person, <hi>to</hi> substitute <hi>the one for
the other: unless he will take</hi> ten times <hi>as much, or</hi> ten times <hi>as little
of the one, as he would have done of the other: if that will serve turn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>51. §. The <hi>Stones</hi> already mentioned, (except the great <hi>Stomach-stone)</hi>
are ordinarily generated in the bodies of <hi>Animals.</hi> I have one
Instance more of some other <hi>Stones</hi> which are extraordinary. In the
City of <hi>Hereford</hi> lives a Maid, who often voids these <hi>Stones,</hi> and in
the space of some years last past, hath voided several pounds, of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Colours</hi> and <hi>Sizes,</hi> not only <hi>per vias urinarias,</hi> but also by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
and by stool. The first mention made to me of them, was by
Mr. <hi>Diggs,</hi> a worthy Gentleman of that City, as a thing that was there
much wondred at. And some of them, upon my desire, were sent
me by Mr. <hi>Wellington,</hi> an Apothecary in the same place. <hi>I have
tryed what several acid Menstrums will work upon them; and find, That
with Oyl of Vitriol, and especially with Spirit of Nitre the great one make
a very quick and conspicuous Effervescence. But the small ones, neither
the white, nor the grey, make any Bullition in the least:</hi> for in truth, they
are no other but little <hi>Pebbles</hi> and <hi>Grit-stones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>52. §. This being considerd, and the various <hi>colours</hi> and <hi>mixture</hi>
of any one of the great <hi>Stones,</hi> being well observed; it seemeth plain,
That although she be somewhat old (above thirty years) yet may she
have a kind of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>diseased Appetite</hi> to <hi>Stones, Bones, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ashes,
Tobacco-Pipes, Chalk,</hi> and such like things; which sometimes
swallowing in little <hi>lumps,</hi> sometimes grosly, or finely ground betwixt
her teeth; they are in her <hi>Stomach</hi> and <hi>Bowels,</hi> more or fewer of them,
<hi>cemented</hi> together, either with a <hi>pituitous, bilious,</hi> or some other more
or less <hi>glutinous substance.</hi> And that by virtue also of the said <hi>Cement,</hi>
or any of the said, or other like <hi>alkalizate Bodies,</hi> the greater <hi>Stones,</hi>
which consist of those partly, do make an <hi>Effervescence</hi> with <hi>acid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors.</hi>
Thus far of <hi>Instances</hi> upon the <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>Animals.</hi> I shall close
with some <hi>Corollaries</hi> deduced from the whole.</p>
                  <p>53. §. And first, since we find, that amongst all the <hi>Menstuums</hi> we
have made use of, <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre,</hi> or any very <hi>Nitrous Spirit,</hi> is the
most <hi>universal dissolver</hi> of all kinds of <hi>Animal Bodies;</hi> the <hi>best dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
of many others both <hi>Vegetable</hi> and <hi>Mineral,</hi> and the <hi>only dissolver</hi>
of some: Hence it is probable, That the great <hi>stomachick Menstruum,</hi>
which either <hi>dissolves,</hi> or <hi>opens</hi> almost all <hi>Bodies</hi> which come into the
<hi>Stomach,</hi> is a kind of <hi>Nitrous Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>54. §. Again, <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre</hi> being a <hi>subalkaline Acid,</hi> and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
more evidently upon <hi>Animal bodies,</hi> than other <hi>simpler Acids</hi> do,
which yet are as <hi>strong;</hi> It hence follows, That most of the <hi>Salts</hi> of
<hi>Animals</hi> are <hi>subacid Alkalies.</hi> How far this <hi>conclusion</hi> may further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
us, I shall have occasion to shew in another <hi>Discourse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>55. §. Lastly, there being so many, say twenty or thirty <hi>degrees,</hi>
from the <hi>slowest</hi> to the most <hi>vehement,</hi> in the <hi>Bullition</hi> of <hi>mixed Bodies;</hi>
it seemeth, That <hi>Fermentation</hi> it self, as to the <hi>formal notion</hi> of it, is
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100350:153"/>
nothing else: or that from the common <hi>Luctation</hi> of <hi>mixed Bodies</hi>
whereof we have now been speaking, it differs not <hi>in specie,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the manner of its <hi>causation,</hi> and in <hi>degree:</hi> the <hi>Aer,</hi> or some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Menstruum</hi> lodged therein, being of no greater <hi>strength,</hi> than to
produce a <hi>Bullition</hi> or <hi>Luctation</hi> of that <hi>low</hi> and <hi>soft degree,</hi> which we
call <hi>Fermentation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>56. §. I have thus endeavoured to prove, by various <hi>Instances,</hi>
how instructive this most easie, plain and simple <hi>Method</hi> in the <hi>Mixture</hi>
of <hi>Bodies,</hi> may become to us: and that meerly by observing the <hi>Lucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
which thence arise betwixt them. How much more then, if a
diligent remarque be made of all those various <hi>Colours, Smells, Tastes,
Consistencies,</hi> and other <hi>Mutations</hi> thereupon emergent?</p>

set down some <hi>Tryals</hi> for an <hi>Essay,</hi> upon <hi>Plants;</hi> chiefly noting, The
different <hi>Proportions</hi> of their <hi>Lixivial Salts.</hi> Of these <hi>Tryals,</hi> some
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100350:154"/>
were made upon the whole <hi>Plant,</hi> or some <hi>Portion</hi> of it wherein several
<hi>Parts</hi> are mixed together: And others, upon some one <hi>Part</hi> of a <hi>Plant</hi>
distinct from the rest. All of them answering to such <hi>Queries,</hi> as may
seem proper to be proposed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Query 1. As first,</hi> Whether Trees or Herbs and Bushes, quantity for
quantity <hi>&amp; caeteris paribus,</hi> yeild the most Lixivial Salt?</p>
                  <p>For this I took <hi>Ash-Barque</hi> and <hi>Rosemary</hi> of each <abbr>lb</abbr>j. The latter
yielded 5 <hi>Scruples;</hi> the former but 32 <hi>Grains;</hi> which is three times less.
I took also the same quantity of the <hi>Barque</hi> of <hi>Black-Thorn,</hi> and of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimony.</hi>
The latter yielded 5 <hi>Scruples</hi> and 6 <hi>Grains;</hi> the former, not
above 1 <hi>Scruple</hi> and 5 <hi>Grains;</hi> which is four times less.</p>
                  <p>Although the <hi>Barque</hi> of a <hi>Tree</hi> be compounded of <hi>Pithy</hi> and <hi>Lignous
Parts;</hi> yet to answer the <hi>Query</hi> exactly, the <hi>Wood</hi> of these <hi>Trees</hi> should
be taken with the <hi>Barque,</hi> that there may be some portion of every
<hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Tree,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Herb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But thus far the <hi>Experiment</hi> is <hi>conclusive,</hi> That the same quantity of

not yield a lesser quantity of Lixivial Salt, than another of the same kindred
growing on the Sea-Coast; and with what difference?</p>
                  <p>For this, I took <hi>Garden</hi> and <hi>Sea-Scurvygrass,</hi> of each <abbr>lb</abbr>j. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
yields 2 <hi>Drachms</hi> and 1 <hi>Scruple;</hi> the latter, being well washed,
9 <hi>Drachms,</hi> which is more than 4 times as much. The like may be
tryed upon others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quer.</hi> 3. Whether the same Specifick Plant affords more Lixivial-Salt,
being only dryed, and then calcin'd, or after it hath first been distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
it is then dryed and calcin'd?</p>
                  <p>For this, was taken <abbr>lb</abbr>j of <hi>Mint</hi> only dryed and then calcin'd; and
another first distilled. The former yielded ½ an Ounce and ½ a
Drachm of <hi>Salt;</hi> the latter, 5 Drachms and a Scruple; which is almost
⅕<hi rend="sup">th</hi> more. This also should be tryed on other <hi>Plants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Quer. 4. <hi>How far the proportion follows the different Tasts of Plants?</hi>
The first Experiment, relates to the same <hi>Tast</hi> in several <hi>Plants;</hi> this,
to several Tasts. And so,</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Majorane,</hi> which is <hi>Aromatick,</hi> 
                     <abbr>lb</abbr>j affords but one Scruple of <hi>Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
Salt;</hi> which is but the 384<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of the whole pound.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Oak-Barque</hi> which is <hi>Astringent,</hi> 
                     <abbr>lb</abbr>j yields ½ a Drachm of <hi>Salt;</hi>
or the 256<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of the whole.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Liquirish,</hi> which is sweet, <abbr>lb</abbr>j yields about the same quantity.
But <hi>Anise Seeds</hi> 
                     <abbr>lb</abbr>j yields 2 Scruples or a 192<hi rend="sup">d</hi> part.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Sorrel,</hi> which is sower, <abbr>lb</abbr>j yields one Drachm, or the 128<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Garden Scurvygrass,</hi> which is <hi>Hot,</hi> 
                     <abbr>lb</abbr>j yields 2 Drachms and ½ a

                  <p>Of <hi>Mint,</hi> which is <hi>Hot</hi> and <hi>Bitter,</hi> 
                     <abbr>lb</abbr>j yields 5 Drachms and a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Sea Scuroygrass,</hi> which is <hi>Salt,</hi> 
                     <abbr>lb</abbr>j yields 9 Drachms and a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

proportion of <hi>Salt,</hi> than in any other <hi>Plant</hi> upon which I have hitherto
made Tryal: Or even in <hi>Tartar</hi> it self. Yet is it not a <hi>Marine,</hi> but
true <hi>Lixivial Salt:</hi> as is evident, both from its <hi>Taste;</hi> and in that it

maketh an <hi>Effervescence</hi> with <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Salt;</hi> which <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> will
not do.</p>
                  <p>For the Experiment to be fully adequate to the <hi>Query;</hi> the <hi>Tryals</hi>
shouldbe made, either all on <hi>Trees,</hi> or all on <hi>Herbs;</hi> all on <hi>Roots,</hi> or all
on <hi>Stalks,</hi> &amp;c. Yet thus much is evident, That <hi>Sorrel</hi> yields Thrice as

<hi>And so, it appears, that</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Majorane,</hi> a <hi>Cephalick,</hi> hath a greater <hi>Proportion</hi> of <hi>Volatile Parts,</hi> than
any of the <hi>Plants</hi> above mentioned, and so far, is more agreeable to the
<hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> and <hi>Genus Nervosum.</hi>

                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mugwort</hi> (<abbr>lb</abbr>j) yields two Drachms and two Scruples; or above half
as much more as <hi>Agrimony.</hi> So that this <hi>Plant,</hi> though it hath no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
<hi>Taste,</hi> and in that respect promiseth but little; yet yielding a
good quantity of <hi>Lixivial Salt,</hi> seems no contemptible <hi>Medicine</hi> to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
those <hi>Acidities</hi> which either by causing <hi>Obstructions,</hi> or immoderate

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mint,</hi> yieldeth still a greater quantity; and is therefore, partly for
the same cause so excellent a <hi>Stomachick:</hi> And <hi>Rosemary,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Common Mallow</hi> (<abbr>lb</abbr>j) yields 5 Drachms and 2 Scruples. <hi>i. e.</hi> the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
part of the whole. So that this <hi>Plant,</hi> though of a very mild <hi>Taste,</hi>
yet yields more <hi>Salt</hi> than <hi>Mint</hi> it self a <hi>Bitter Plant.</hi> Whereby it no
longer seems strange, that a <hi>Plant</hi> of so soft a <hi>Taste,</hi> should be very
<hi>Diuretick,</hi> and so evidently affect the <hi>Reins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rhubarb</hi> (2 Ounces) yieldeth scarce any fixed <hi>Salt,</hi> so far as can be
judged by the <hi>Taste</hi> of the <hi>Ashes,</hi> not more than a Grain or two. So
that its <hi>Salt</hi> is, in a manner, wholly volatile; and thereby apter to
operate upon the <hi>Bilious</hi> parts of the <hi>Blood;</hi> which contein a far greater
proportion of <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> than do the <hi>Serous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> or meer <hi>Earth,</hi> it is observable, that it
was near ½ an Ounce or ¼<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of the whole; Which is almost Six
times as much as the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of <hi>Common Dock:</hi> and much more
than that of any other <hi>Root</hi> I have yet calcin'd. Whereby it seemeth
probable that <hi>Rhubarb</hi> looseth much of its <hi>Volatile Part,</hi> and therefore
of its <hi>Virtue,</hi> before it comes to our <hi>Shops.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sena</hi> (<abbr>lb</abbr>j) yields 4 Scuples and ½ of <hi>Salt;</hi> or the 85<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jalap</hi> (<abbr>lb</abbr>j) yields but one Drachm and 15 Grains, or 102<hi rend="sup">d</hi> part.</p>

of a <hi>Plant,</hi> as well <hi>Organick,</hi> as <hi>Content,</hi> separated

                  </p>
                  <p>Quer. 1. <hi>What Proportion doth the Lixivial Salt
of the Pith or Pithy Part of a Plant, bear to that of
the Fibrous, or of the Woody Part? Or whether is
there a Fixed Salt always found in either of them?</hi> A
sufficient <hi>Answer</hi> to which, must be built upon many <hi>Tryals.</hi> At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
I shall mention only Two; one upon <hi>Starch,</hi> answerable to the
<hi>Pithy Parts;</hi> the other upon <hi>Flax,</hi> consisting almost wholly of the
<hi>Nervous</hi> or <hi>Towy Fibres:</hi> of the <hi>Volatile parts</hi> whereof, chiefly, I have
given some account in the foregoing <hi>Idea.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 50, 51, 52.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Starch,</hi> 
                     <abbr>lb</abbr>j yieldeth about <abbr>lb</abbr>¼ not of <hi>Ashes,</hi> but of <hi>Black Coal.</hi>
For though it be exposed in a <hi>Calcining Furnace</hi> to a vehement <hi>fire,</hi> for
5 or 6 hours, which is longer then will serve to calcine most Bodies:
yet would it not in the least part, be reduced to <hi>Ashes;</hi> but to the last
continued (though the fierceness of the <hi>Fire</hi> consumed part of it) as
<hi>black,</hi> as when it was first burnt. So strangely was the remaining part
of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> fixed to the <hi>Earth;</hi> that in flying away, it did volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
and carry that away with it. In this <hi>Coal</hi> or <hi>Cinder,</hi> there is not
the least of a <hi>Lixivial</hi> or other <hi>Taste.</hi> And although, upon <hi>Tryal</hi> I find,
That the <hi>Pith</hi> of many <hi>Plants,</hi> as of a <hi>Cabbage Stalk,</hi> will yield some
quantity of <hi>Lixivial Salt;</hi> yet it is probably, that generally, it yields
less than the <hi>Wood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Flax,</hi> 
                     <abbr>lb</abbr>j yields not above 50 Grains of <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> or <hi>white
Ashes,</hi> which are <hi>Salt.</hi> According to vulgar conceit, it would seem
to be a very dry Body: yet of 153 parts, 152 are <hi>volatile,</hi> and being
distilled would have been collected into <hi>Liquor.</hi> Hence also appears
the great and unexpected <hi>Variety</hi> in the <hi>Proportion</hi> of the <hi>Earthy Parts,</hi>
as well as the other <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Bodies.</hi> Or else, that there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
kinds of <hi>Earths,</hi> even in <hi>Plants,</hi> of which, as well as of <hi>Salts</hi> &amp;c.
some are <hi>volatile.</hi> For of <abbr>lb</abbr>j of this <hi>Plant,</hi> there remaineth fixed but
50 Grains: whereas of <abbr>lb</abbr>j of <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> there will remain near 1920
Grains, <hi>i. e.</hi> 88 times as much as the former.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quer.</hi> 2. In what proportion is the Lixivial Salt found in the Gumms
of Plants? and whether is it yielded, more or less, by all? <hi>For answer to
which, I caused the Eleven following, of each two Ounces, to be
calcin'd, and so observed,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Common Rosin,</hi> yields but one Grain and ½ of <hi>Caput Mortuum.</hi>
So that <abbr>lb</abbr>j will yield but 12 Grains. In this <hi>Caput Mort.</hi> there is not
the least particle of <hi>Salt,</hi> it being altogether insipid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mastick</hi> yields gr. 12 of <hi>Cap. Mort.</hi> But not the least part of <hi>Salt.</hi>
Of this <hi>Rosin,</hi> it is observable; That being set, in a <hi>Crucible,</hi> within
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100350:155"/>
the fire, before it comes to have thick fumes, it boyls up with a very
great foame or froath; and is the only <hi>Gum</hi> or <hi>Rosin</hi> (of the Eleven)
that hath this property. So that I suspect, there is a great quantity of
some kind of <hi>volatile Spirit,</hi> which then flies away; and so, in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through the <hi>Oyly parts,</hi> huffs them up to so great a froath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Olibanum</hi> yields half a Drachm of <hi>Caput Mortuum.</hi> But it is to be
noted, That the weight is encreased by certain little <hi>Spar-Stones,</hi> which
in the burning of several parcels, I always found mixed with this <hi>Gumm.</hi>
These being picked clean out, the <hi>Cap. Mort.</hi> weigheth not much more
than that of <hi>Mastick.</hi> And is in like manner insipid, when the said
<hi>Stones</hi> are picked out.</p>
                  <p>From hence it appears, how proper these <hi>Gums</hi> are for the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction</hi>
of <hi>Salt Rheums;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Discourse</hi> of <hi>Mixture</hi> Cap. Ult.</note> according to what I have formerly suggested
from another Experiment.</p>
                  <p>It may also be noted, that <hi>Rosin</hi> and <hi>Mastick,</hi> seem to be more
purely <hi>Acidoleous Gums;</hi> not only from their consistence which is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form;
and their <hi>Smell,</hi> which is less strong and more pleasant: but
also from the <hi>Acid Liquor</hi> they yield by <hi>Distillation;</hi> and in that the
young <hi>Leavs</hi> of <hi>Fir,</hi> and especially of <hi>Pine,</hi> are sower; and tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that those of <hi>Mastick</hi> are so likewise. Whereby these, and
other like <hi>Gums</hi> are more especially fitted for the abovesaid purpose.
But <hi>Olibanum</hi> seems, besides its <hi>Acidity,</hi> to contein some <hi>Volatile Alkaly,</hi>
and so to be an <hi>Acid-Alkaline Gum.</hi> For as it hath a stronger <hi>Smell</hi>
than the former, so a hotter <hi>Taste;</hi> both the ordinary effects of an
<hi>Alkaline Sulphur.</hi> And being infused in several <hi>Menstruums,</hi> appears
to constist of two Bodies, one of them more <hi>Resinous</hi> than the other.
Of which, it is probable, that the one is made by the <hi>Acid parts</hi> as the
other by the <hi>Alkaline.</hi> Whereby it is very well adapted in some <hi>Cases,</hi>
as in a <hi>Pleuresie,</hi> for removing the <hi>Coagulations</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> or its
disposition thereunto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Asa foetida</hi> yileds no less than half its weight or an Ounce of <hi>Caput
Mort.</hi> that is 8 times as much as that of the other <hi>Gumms,</hi> and 48 times
as much as that of some of them. Yet doth it not contein one grain of
<hi>Salt,</hi> so far as can be judged by its <hi>Tast.</hi> Yet the <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somness</hi>
of the <hi>Smell</hi> and <hi>Tast</hi> of the <hi>Gumm</hi> do argue it to be highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with some kind of <hi>Volatile Alkaly</hi> proper to arrest those
offensive <hi>Vapours</hi> (to use the vulgar word) which flying, either by
the <hi>Blood</hi> or <hi>Nerves,</hi> from part to part, do often prove so trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gum Arabick</hi> yields one Scruple of <hi>Cap. Mort.</hi> whereof, by the

                  <p>

                     <hi>Scammony</hi> yields Two Scruples of <hi>Cap. Mort.</hi> of which, about half a

                     <hi>Gutta Gamba</hi> yields but half a Scruple of <hi>Cap. Mort.</hi> of which four

                  </p>
                  <p>So that considering the <hi>Dose</hi> of any <hi>Cathartick Gumm,</hi> the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  <p>Yet none of the <hi>Cathartick Gumms</hi> are without some portion, more

to prove, That the Fixed it self, hath some Interest in the business
of <hi>Purgation:</hi> as by being a <hi>Clog</hi> to the <hi>Volatile,</hi> and so preventing its
being deleterious; or some other way. But the manner of their <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
will better be understood, when the <hi>Volatile Parts</hi> have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
been examined.</p>
                  <p>It may also be of good import, to know, what different quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Salt,</hi> are afforded by the <hi>Tartars</hi> of all sorts of <hi>Wines</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
partly, as well as by the quantity of the <hi>Tartar,</hi> we may be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the better to judge of the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Wines.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>OMETIME since, I took the boldness to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
my thoughts to this Honourable and Learned
Body in a <hi>Discourse</hi> concerning <hi>Mixture.</hi> Wherein
I have endeavoured to lay such a <hi>Foundation,</hi> as
might hereafter reduce the <hi>Doctrine</hi> hereof to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi>
and <hi>Practise;</hi> and to demonstrate, the <hi>Power</hi>
and <hi>Use</hi> of <hi>Artificial Mixture.</hi> And in further proof
of what is therein asserted, I have since made a continuation of <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments</hi>
upon the same Subject, in Two <hi>Methods.</hi> One in the <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of several <hi>Menstruums,</hi> both <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkaline,</hi> with all Sorts of
<hi>Bodies.</hi> The Other, by calcining them, or, as it were, <hi>mixing</hi> them
with the <hi>Fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. §. I shall now proceed to a Third, which is, the <hi>mixing</hi> them
with the <hi>Aer</hi> or exposing them to it; another of Natures grand <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struums;</hi>
which goes sometimes further than the <hi>Fire</hi> it self, in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:100350:157"/>
of Bodies. This I have formerly mentioned for the Imitation
of <hi>Nature,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Discourse</hi> of <hi>Mixture</hi> Ch. 5. Inst. 2.</note> in producing a <hi>Marine</hi> or <hi>Muriatick Salt</hi> out of the <hi>Lixivial
Salt</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi> But some Learned Persons then present, seeming to
doubt of the Experiment; I thought it requisite to prosecute the same
a little further; that so, if possible, it might become clear and unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable.
And because that <hi>Method</hi> was imperfect, and required half a
year, or a longer time: I bethought my self of an other way; which
proved far better, and more expedite. And which, withall, afforded
me, not only a true <hi>Marine Salt,</hi> out of the <hi>Lixivial Salt</hi> of a <hi>Plant;</hi>
but also another kind of <hi>Salt,</hi> different from them both: which may
not be improperly called, an <hi>Essential Salt</hi> or <hi>Nitre</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi> The
History or manner of the production of them both, is as follows.</p>
                  <p>3. §. <hi>December</hi> 15. 1675, I took about half a pound of a strong
<hi>Solution</hi> of the <hi>Lixivial Salt</hi> of <hi>Firne:</hi> and pouring it into an <hi>Earthen
Pan,</hi> well glazed, broad and shallow, exposed it therein to the open
<hi>Aer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 83.</note> in a Chamber Window, to evaporate of it self.</p>
                  <p>4. §. This <hi>Solution</hi> or <hi>Lee,</hi> although it was very clear before, and
having stood corked up in a bottle many days, had no sedement: yet
standing now in the open <hi>Aer,</hi> within the space of 4 or 5 days, it began
to let fall a very <hi>white Sedement,</hi> like fine <hi>Chalk;</hi> which encreased daily
for 8 or 10 days; amounting at last to about half a Drachm of white,
light and meer <hi>Earth,</hi> altogether insipid, and when it was well washed,
stirring not upon the <hi>Affusion</hi> of <hi>Acids.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. §. Within the space of a day or two after this <hi>white Sedement</hi>
began to fall to the bottom; there was also gatherd on the top, a
kind of soft <hi>Scum</hi> or <hi>Cremor,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Solution</hi> was covered all
over.</p>
                  <p>6. §. Within 8 or 9 days after the first exposing of the <hi>Liquor,</hi> or
2 or 3 days after the gathering of the <hi>Cremor;</hi> that <hi>Salt,</hi> which I take
leave to call, an <hi>Essential Salt</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> began to appear; shooting
into several little <hi>Crystals.</hi> These <hi>Crystals,</hi> as they grew bigger, began
to sink, and at last fell down to the bottom of the <hi>Pan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. §. Upon their first generation or shooting, the said <hi>Cremor</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
breaks, leaving a bare space round about each <hi>Crystal;</hi> and upon
the bounds of every space is indented;<note place="margin">Tab. 83.</note> the space growing bigger and
bigger together with the <hi>Crystal</hi> in the Centre. And so, by that time
the <hi>Crystals</hi> are grown to a considerable number and bigness, the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi>
vanishes away, the several <hi>Circles</hi> or bare places breaking at last
one into another all over the <hi>Surface</hi> of the <hi>Lee.</hi> After which, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
comes again.</p>
                  <p>8. §. From whence it seemeth, That the several <hi>Circles</hi> or bare
<hi>Spaces</hi> about the <hi>Crystals,</hi> are made for the more free admission of the
<hi>Aer,</hi> requisite to their <hi>Generation.</hi> For as there is no <hi>Crystal</hi> begins to
be formed before there is a breach made in the <hi>Cremor:</hi> so that breach
is enlarged together with the <hi>Crystal.</hi> So that as the falling of the
<hi>Sedement</hi> and the gathering of the <hi>Cremor,</hi> sheweth that the <hi>Aer,</hi> as a <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum</hi>
separates some part from the <hi>Lee:</hi> so the breaking of the <hi>Cremor</hi>
afterwards, that as a <hi>Vehicle,</hi> it brings something to it: both in order
to the <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Crystals. Nature</hi> taking a <hi>Method</hi> for the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of simpler Bodies, as well as of those which are <hi>Compounded</hi> and
<hi>Organical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:100350:157"/>
9. §. The <hi>Figure</hi> of these <hi>Crystals</hi> is angular and oblong, most of
them about the fifth, sixth or seventh of an Inch; but none of them
very regular. Yet we are not hence to conclude, but that with the
help of some Circumstances which might be wanting in the shooting of
these; some portion of regular ones may be obteined from this, as well
as other <hi>Lixivial Salts</hi> hereafter mentioned.</p>
                  <p>10. §. They are somewhat transparent, and of a dark <hi>Ambar Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi>
or like that of brown <hi>Sugar-Candy.</hi> Of a quite different <hi>Taste</hi>
from that of the <hi>Solution</hi> or <hi>Lee</hi> out of which they are bred; being not
at all <hi>Lixivial,</hi> but very weak and mild; not <hi>Salt,</hi> but <hi>Bitter</hi> in a
good degree.</p>
                  <p>11. §. It is also observable, that <hi>Alkaline</hi> and <hi>Acid Salts</hi> being both
poured severally upon these <hi>Crystals,</hi> they stir not, nor are any way
affected with either of them. So that these <hi>Crystals</hi> are no sort of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
or <hi>Tartareous Salt.</hi> As is plain, from the manner of their <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Tartar</hi> being still bred in close <hi>Vessels;</hi> these never, but by expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the <hi>Liquor</hi> to the <hi>Aer.</hi> As also from their <hi>Taste,</hi> being not sower,
in the least, but bitter. And in that <hi>Tartar</hi> will make a <hi>Bullition</hi> with
<hi>Alkaline Salts,</hi> which these will not do. Upon which accounts it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that they are a <hi>Salt</hi> different in Nature from all other <hi>Salts</hi>
hitherto known, or a new <hi>Species</hi> added to the <hi>Inventory</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. §. These <hi>Crystals</hi> within the space of about a fortnight after
their first <hi>Generation,</hi> did also cease to shoot any more, but only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
a little in their <hi>Bulk.</hi> After which time, I dayly expected to
see the production also of a true <hi>Marine Salt.</hi> And about two months
after the said <hi>Essential Crystals</hi> had done shooting, and not before, this
also began to shoot, in many small <hi>Crystals,</hi> and at the top of the <hi>Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as the other did, still falling to the bottom as they grew
biger.</p>
                  <p>13. §. The <hi>Size</hi> of most of them was near that of the <hi>Flakes</hi> or
<hi>Grains</hi> of <hi>Bay-Salt.</hi> The <hi>Colour</hi> of some of them <hi>white,</hi> of others <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparent;</hi>
and of others <hi>white</hi> in the <hi>Centre,</hi> with transparent <hi>Edges;</hi> as
is also usual in the <hi>Crystals</hi> of <hi>Common Salt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. §. The <hi>Figure</hi> of most is a perfect <hi>Square,</hi> and of very many
coming near to a <hi>Cube;</hi> which is also the <hi>Figure</hi> of <hi>Common Salt,</hi> and
seldome an exact <hi>Cube.</hi> An exact <hi>Cube,</hi> being the constant property of
no <hi>Marine Salt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 83.</note> that I know of, except that of the <hi>Dead Sea.</hi> Divers
of them were also raised as it were by several steps from a deep Centre
to the Top: as is often seen in the common shooting of <hi>Common Salt;</hi>
and not in any other. Their <hi>Taste</hi> is neither <hi>Lixivial,</hi> as that of the
<hi>Solution</hi> out of which they shoot; nor bitterish, as that of the <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Crystals;</hi> nor sowerish, as that of <hi>Tartar;</hi> but the perfect <hi>Taste</hi>
of <hi>Common Salt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. §. It is also to be noted, That if <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and some other
strong <hi>Acids,</hi> be poured upon this artificial <hi>Sea-Salt,</hi> they make an <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fervescence</hi>
together: but if <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Salt</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre</hi> either be
poured on it, though it be never so strong it stirreth it not. In both
which, and all the formentioned respects, it answers to the <hi>Properties</hi> of
a <hi>Marine</hi> or <hi>Common Salt,</hi> which no other <hi>Salt</hi> doth. I conclude it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be a true <hi>Marine Salt</hi> produced by <hi>Art</hi> in the imitation of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Wherein is shewed, That the said ESSENTIAL
and MARINE Salts of Plants are both of different
Sorts.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING made the Experiment, that both an
<hi>Essential</hi> and <hi>Marine Salt</hi> may be produced out
of the <hi>Lixival Salt</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi> I thought it
probable, that neither the one nor the other,
was always the same, but that as they had their
general properties which made them to be of
two general kinds; so they might have some
special property, for the distinguishing of each
kind into several Sorts. And withall, that
in a warmer season, than before taken, the <hi>Tryal</hi> hereof might be
finished in a shorter time.</p>
                  <p>2. §. For the making of which, I conceived it requisite to remove
an Opinion which seemed to lye in my way; <hi>sc.</hi> That there is little
or no difference between the several <hi>Lixivial Salts</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> as some
Learned men have thought. But either there is a difference, or not: if
not, it should be proved: and if there be, it should then be justly stated,
what that difference is. For the doing of which, I chose this <hi>Method.</hi> I
took an equal quantity of the whitest and purest <hi>Salts</hi> of divers <hi>Plants,</hi>
all made by an equal degree of <hi>Calcination;</hi> and dissolved them all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally
in an equal quantity of water. And pouring likewise an equal
quantity, as about 10 or 12 drops of each into a spoon, I tasted them
severally. Whereby it was very evident, that they were not all of one
<hi>Tast,</hi> but of very different ones, both as to strength and kind: and
therefore different in Nature also. The <hi>Salts</hi> I made tryal of were
those of <hi>Sorrel, Anise, Wormwood, Mallow, Ash, Tartar</hi> and others:
and upon half a Drachm of each I poured ℥ijss of water. The <hi>Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
are here present to be tasted. By which the differences will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
be observed, and particularly that the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Wormwood</hi> or <hi>Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vygrass,</hi>
is almost as strong again as the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Anise,</hi> or <hi>Sorrel:</hi> and that
the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Ash</hi> is above twice as strong, and that of <hi>Tartar</hi> above
thrice as strong, as that of <hi>Sorrel,</hi> and almost thrice as strong as that of
<hi>Wormwood</hi> or <hi>Scurvygrass.</hi> So that he who shall give half a Scruple,
suppose of <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar;</hi> instead of half a Scruple of <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi>
or other like <hi>Salt;</hi> he may as well give a Scruple of <hi>Rosin</hi> of
<hi>Jalap,</hi> for a Scruple of the powder, or almost three<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Drachms of <hi>Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>arb,</hi>
or other like <hi>Purge,</hi> instead of one. And the like is to be said
of other <hi>Lixivial Salts</hi> in their degrees.</p>
                  <p>3. §. Having observed thus much, I proceeded to repeat the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Experiment, with some of the aforesaid, and some other <hi>Vegetable
Salts,</hi> the best calcin'd, and the purest, that could be made for this
purpose, being these Six <hi>Salts, sc.</hi> of <hi>Rosemary, Garden Scurvygrass,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:100350:158"/>
Black Thorn, Common Wormwood, Ash,</hi> and <hi>Tartar.</hi> All which dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
severally in fair water, I exposed in a Chamber window, and
not in Winter, as before, but in the heat of Summer, <hi>sc.</hi> on the 19 of
<hi>July,</hi> to evaporate of themselves.</p>
                  <p>4. §. The Effect was, That the third day after their being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
the <hi>Essential Crystals</hi> began to shoot in three of the <hi>Solutions,
sc.</hi> in that of <hi>Rosemary,</hi> of <hi>Garden Scurvygrass,</hi> and of <hi>Black Thorn.</hi>
On the fouth day, in that of <hi>Wormwood.</hi> On the fifth day, in that of
<hi>Ash.</hi> In that of <hi>Tartar,</hi> not at all.</p>
                  <p>5. §. These <hi>Essential Crystals</hi> began, in all, to shoot at the top, and
then to fall to the bottome; as in the Experiment before. But as there
was very little of the <hi>white Sedement</hi> before mentioned, that preceded;
So no <hi>Scum</hi> or <hi>Cremor</hi> at all. Which although a more perfect <hi>Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
it seems, did here almost prevent; yet did not in the least destroy
the aforesaid <hi>Essential Salt,</hi> but rather make way for its more speedy and
copious <hi>Production:</hi> exhibiting likewise a distinct <hi>Species</hi> in several of
the <hi>Solutions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. §. For first, the <hi>Crystals</hi> of <hi>Rosemary</hi> (the largest of them)
were about the bigness of a <hi>Rice-Corn.</hi> In <hi>Figure</hi> almost like a <hi>Tip-Cat,</hi>
which Boys play with,<note place="margin">Tab. 83.</note> split down the midle. Each <hi>Tip</hi> being cut into
5 sides all ending in a poynt: the middle part divided into 7, all drawn
by parallel <hi>Lines;</hi> the topmost with the lowermost but one, on each
side, beeing three exact <hi>Squares.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. §. The <hi>Crystals</hi> of <hi>Black Thorn</hi> are most of them poynted with
just six sides of Equal <hi>Measure:</hi> very like to the shooting of true
<hi>Crystal</hi> it self.<note place="margin">Tab. 83.</note> From the topmost of which six Sides, a <hi>Line</hi> being drawn
out, runs parallel to a broad <hi>Base,</hi> whereon each <hi>Crystal</hi> stands. So
that they are in some sort of a <hi>Rhomboid Figure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. §. The <hi>Crystals</hi> of <hi>Scurvygrass</hi> have also a very elegant and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Figure,</hi> which is in a manner compounded of the two former now
described. But they are nothing near so bigg, the largest of them,
being no biger than a <hi>Grain</hi> of that which we call <hi>Pearl Barley.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. §. The <hi>Crystals</hi> of <hi>Wormwood</hi> have also very many of them a
regular <hi>Figure;</hi> but quite different from that of the <hi>Crystals</hi> before
mentioned; each <hi>Crystal</hi> being a little <hi>Cylinder,</hi> saving that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
somewhat smaller at one end,<note place="margin">Tab. 83.</note> than the other: as it were one half
of a <hi>Rowling-pin.</hi> And not evenly <hi>Circular,</hi> but cut out by Six <hi>Sides</hi>
of equal <hi>Measure:</hi> almost as in the <hi>Crystal</hi> of <hi>Nitre.</hi> So that contrary to
what is seen in the forementioned <hi>Crystals,</hi> the ends of these of
<hi>Wormwood</hi> are not poynted, but <hi>flat;</hi> and cut at <hi>Right Angles</hi> with
the <hi>Sides.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. §. The <hi>Crystals</hi> of <hi>Ash,</hi> though by their properties they appear
likewise to be <hi>Essential;</hi> yet are nothing near so regularly figur'd, as
all the forementioned.</p>
                  <p>11. §. The <hi>Colour</hi> also of the said <hi>Crystals</hi> is somewhat different:
Those of <hi>Ash</hi> being of a <hi>brown</hi> transparency, almost like those of <hi>Firne.</hi>
Those of <hi>Wormwood</hi> being also <hi>brownish,</hi> but <hi>paler.</hi> Those of <hi>Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary</hi>
and <hi>Scurvygrass</hi> having some little <hi>Tincture,</hi> yet very <hi>clear.</hi> But
those of <hi>Black Thorn</hi> without the least <hi>Tincture,</hi> and as <hi>clear</hi> as <hi>Crystal</hi>
it self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:100350:159"/>
12. §. None of these <hi>Essential Crystals</hi> have any hot siery <hi>Taste,</hi> but
are very <hi>mild,</hi> and sensibly <hi>Bitter;</hi> especially, about the <hi>Root</hi> of the
<hi>Tongue:</hi> as is also observable of some <hi>Plants</hi> hereafter mentioned, in
speaking of the different <hi>Tastes</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. §. <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> droped upon these <hi>Crystals</hi> doth not affect
them in the least: yet droped into the several <hi>Solutions</hi> out of which
the <hi>Crystals</hi> are produced, immediately causeth a great <hi>Effervescence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. §. Of the <hi>Solutions</hi> above named, that, of <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> was
the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Whereof it is remarquable, That having waited several
Months together, I could not observe the least <hi>Essential Salt</hi> to be
therein produced in all that time. Whether there be any other <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Salts,</hi> besides this of <hi>Tartar,</hi> which will not yield the <hi>Essential</hi>
above described, I have not yet experimented.</p>
                  <p>15. §. In the mean time, from the <hi>Premises</hi> it is very probable,
that most of them afford more or fewer of the said <hi>Crystals.</hi> In regard
they are <hi>Plants</hi> of a very different kind, which I made tryal upon:
as <hi>Garden Scurvygrass,</hi> very <hi>Hot; Rosemary,</hi> very <hi>Aromatick. Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>
very <hi>Bitter; Black Thorne, Astringent</hi> and <hi>Sower.</hi> And it is also
plain, That the said <hi>Essential Salts</hi> contained in the <hi>Lixivial,</hi> are not
altogether one and the same, but of divers Sorts.</p>
                  <p>16. §. ABOUT 7 or 8 days after the <hi>Essential Crystals</hi> were produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
the <hi>Marine Salt</hi> did also begin to shoot; first in <hi>Rosemary;</hi> quickly
after, in <hi>Scurvygrass;</hi> Next, in <hi>Black Thorn</hi> and <hi>Wormwood, sc.</hi> after
the space of a week or 10 days more. And in all of them with some
difference of <hi>Size</hi> and <hi>Figure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. §. The plainest of all, was that produced out of the <hi>Salt</hi> of
<hi>Black Thorn,</hi> consisting for the most part of very small <hi>Crystals,</hi> not
above the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of an Inch square, as also <hi>thin,</hi> shaped like a <hi>Duch Tile</hi>
used for <hi>Chimnies.</hi> Many others were very <hi>thick,</hi> and near to a
<hi>Cube.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. 83.</note> Most of which were a little hollowed in the midle, like a grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Marble</hi> or <hi>Salt-Celler;</hi> and the hollow bounded by 4 plain and
equal <hi>Sides,</hi> all descending a little towards the <hi>Centre;</hi> and measured
by two cross <hi>Lines,</hi> which staid upon the four <hi>Angles</hi> of the <hi>Square,</hi>
and so cut one the other at <hi>Right Angles.</hi> Both which <hi>Properties</hi>
are likewise usually seen in the <hi>Crystals</hi> of <hi>Common Salt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. §. In <hi>Wormwood,</hi> many of these <hi>Crystals,</hi> besides the plain
ones, were figur'd crossways like a <hi>Dagger-Hilt.</hi> Which was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
naked,<note place="margin">Tab. 83.</note> and sometimes inclosed in a square and almost <hi>Cubical Box.</hi>
Many others were figur'd into <hi>Sprigs</hi> made up of four chief <hi>Branches</hi>
standing crosswise, and those <hi>subbranched;</hi> and all the <hi>Branches</hi> made
up of little square <hi>Crystals,</hi> clustered together in that <hi>Figure.</hi> The
<hi>Sprigy Figure</hi> of these <hi>Crystals</hi> is not accidental, but hath constantly
come after they had been three times dissolved, and the <hi>Solution</hi> expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to evaporate.</p>
                  <p>19. §. The <hi>Marine Salt</hi> of <hi>Rosemary</hi> hath also some variety. For
besides the plain ones above described, there are some thick <hi>Squares,</hi>
which have also a square hollow descending by five,<note place="margin">Tab. 83.</note> six, or seven nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
steps, towards the <hi>Centre;</hi> being in <hi>Figure,</hi> saving these <hi>Steps,</hi>
somewhat like the <hi>Hoper</hi> in a <hi>Mill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. §. Upon a second <hi>Solution</hi> of the same <hi>Salt,</hi> there shoots an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
sort of square; which is not plain on the edges, as the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named,<note place="margin">Tab. 83.</note>
but scalloped or florid all round about, not unlike the <hi>Leaves</hi>
of some <hi>Plants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:100350:159"/>
21. §. The <hi>Crystals</hi> of <hi>Marine Salt</hi> of <hi>Scruvygrass</hi> are somewhat
like to those of <hi>Rosemary</hi> now described.</p>
                  <p>22. §. As for the <hi>Lixivial Salts</hi> of <hi>Ash</hi> and <hi>Tartar,</hi> though in a
Month or Five Weeks Space, they yield some <hi>Crystals</hi> of very clear
<hi>Salt:</hi> yet of <hi>Marine Salt</hi> neither of them yieldeth the least particle.
So that of these Six <hi>Lixivial Salts, sc.</hi> of <hi>Rosemary, Scurvygrass, Black
Thorn, Wormwood, Ash</hi> and <hi>Tartar,</hi> all, but that of <hi>Tartar,</hi> yielded an
<hi>Essential Salt.</hi> And all, but those of <hi>Ash</hi> and <hi>Tartar,</hi> yielded a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi>
such as is above described. All which <hi>Salts</hi> both <hi>Essential</hi> and
<hi>Marine,</hi> together with their <hi>Models,</hi> made of <hi>white Alabastre,</hi> I have
here ready to be seen.</p>
                  <p>23. §. Of those that yield these <hi>Salts,</hi> or either of them, it is
further to be noted, That there is a considerable difference in the
<hi>Proportion</hi> or <hi>Quantities</hi> which they yield. The <hi>Rosemary</hi> yields store
both of <hi>Essential</hi> and <hi>Marine,</hi> but more <hi>Essential. Wormwood</hi> and <hi>Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vygrass</hi>
more <hi>Marine. Black Thorn</hi> less of Either. The <hi>Ash</hi> no
<hi>Marine,</hi> and the <hi>Tartar</hi> neither the <hi>Essential</hi> nor <hi>Marine,</hi> as hath
been said.</p>
                  <p>24. §. From what hath been said, I deduce only at present these
Three <hi>Corallaie. First,</hi> That a <hi>Lixivial Salt,</hi> is not only a compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Body <hi>sc.</hi> of <hi>Salt, Sulphur, Aer</hi> and <hi>Earth;</hi> but even a <hi>Compounded
Salt,</hi> containing both a <hi>Vegetable Nitre,</hi> and a true <hi>Sea Salt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>25. §. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Exposing</hi> of <hi>Bodies,</hi> in the manner
above shewed, may justly be accounted one <hi>Part</hi> of <hi>Chymistry</hi> hitherto
<hi>Deficient,</hi> and much farther to be improved for the <hi>Discovery</hi> of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of <hi>Bodies.</hi> For as <hi>Nature</hi> chiefly compoundeth <hi>Bodies</hi> by <hi>Digesting</hi>
them, and so either shutting out or keeping in the <hi>Aer:</hi> So she <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth</hi>
them by <hi>Exposing,</hi> and so neither shutting in the <hi>Aer,</hi> nor keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it out, but leaving it free to come and go; and thereby to bring,
and carry off whatsoever is necessary for the <hi>Separation</hi> or <hi>Solution</hi> of
<hi>Bodies.</hi> For the <hi>Sea</hi> it self (to confine the similitude to our present case)
is but as a <hi>Great Pan,</hi> wherein all kinds of bodies being long exposed,
are throughly resolved, ultimately yielding from the rest of their <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Principles,</hi> that which we call <hi>Sea Salt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>26. §. <hi>Lastly,</hi> if by <hi>Exposing</hi> and <hi>Dissolving</hi> we can make one <hi>Satl;</hi>
then by <hi>Compounding</hi> and <hi>Digesting</hi> we may make another, yea any
other <hi>Salt;</hi> either a <hi>Fixed</hi> of a <hi>Volatile,</hi> or a <hi>Volatile</hi> of a <hi>Fixed.</hi> That
is to say, a <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> may be so separated from other <hi>Bodies,</hi> as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Fixed;</hi> or a <hi>Fixed Salt</hi> may be so <hi>mixed</hi> with other <hi>Bodies</hi> as to
become <hi>Volatile.</hi> For that any <hi>Salt</hi> should of it self become <hi>Fixed</hi> or
<hi>Volatile,</hi> is a <hi>Fixion</hi> not grounded upon <hi>Experiment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>27. §. As for the <hi>Virtue</hi> of the <hi>Essential Salts</hi> above described, I
believe they will be found upon tryal, not contemptible in some
Cases. For which amongst other reasons, I have been the more punctual
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100350:160"/>
in relating the manner of their <hi>Generation;</hi> that others also may have
the opportunity of making proof hereof.</p>
                  <p>28. §. When I made the <hi>Experiments</hi> for this and the foregoing
<hi>Discourse,</hi> not having so good conveniency at home for making the
<hi>Salts</hi> I used: I procured them all (except that of <hi>Firne,</hi> which I made
my self) to be purposely prepared by Mr. <hi>John Blackstone</hi> a <hi>London
Apothecary,</hi> who assured me of his great care herein; and particularly,
that he added no <hi>Nitre</hi> to whiten any of the <hi>Salts</hi> with, as is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done for that of <hi>Tartar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do declare, That all the <hi>Lixivial Salts</hi>
mentioned in this and the foregoing <hi>Discourse</hi>
except that of <hi>Firne,</hi> were faithfully prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by me</p>

2. §. <hi>First,</hi> Of those several <hi>Colours,</hi> which appear in <hi>Plants</hi> in their
<hi>Natural Estate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. §. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As they appear upon the <hi>Infusion</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> into
several Sorts of <hi>Liquors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. §. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As upon the <hi>Mixture</hi> of those <hi>Infusions,</hi> or of any
one of them with some other <hi>Liquor,</hi> or other <hi>Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. §. As they appear in the <hi>Plants</hi> themselves, it may be observed
in the first place, That there is a far less variety in the <hi>Colours</hi> of <hi>Roots,</hi>
than of the other <hi>Parts:</hi> the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> being, within the <hi>Skin,</hi> usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>White,</hi> sometimes <hi>Yellow,</hi> rarely <hi>Red.</hi> The <hi>Cause</hi> hereof being,
for that they are kept, by the <hi>Earth,</hi> from a free and open <hi>Aer;</hi> which
concurreth with the <hi>Juyces</hi> of the several <hi>Parts,</hi> to the <hi>Production</hi> of
their several <hi>Colours.</hi> And therefore the upper parts of <hi>Roots,</hi> when
they happen to stand naked above the Ground, are often deyed with
several <hi>Colours:</hi> so the tops of <hi>Sorrel Roots</hi> will turn <hi>Red,</hi> those of <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
Turneps</hi> and <hi>Radishes,</hi> will turn <hi>purple,</hi> and many others <hi>green.</hi>
Whereas those parts of the same <hi>Roots</hi> which lie more under Ground,
are commonly <hi>White.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. §. As <hi>Roots</hi> are most commonly <hi>White;</hi> so the <hi>Leaves, Green.</hi>
Which <hi>Colour</hi> is so proper to them, that many <hi>Leaves,</hi> as those of <hi>Sage,</hi>
the young <hi>Sprouts</hi> of St. <hi>Johns-wort,</hi> and others, which are <hi>Redish</hi>
when in the <hi>Bud;</hi> upon their full <hi>Growth,</hi> acquire a perfect <hi>Green.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. §. The <hi>Cause</hi> of this <hi>Colour,</hi> is the <hi>action</hi> of the <hi>Aer,</hi> both from
within, and from without the <hi>Plant,</hi> upon the <hi>Juyces</hi> thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it strikes them into that <hi>Colour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. §. By the <hi>Aer</hi> from without, I mean that which surrounds the
<hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Plant:</hi> which is the Cause of its <hi>Greeness,</hi> not meerly as
it is contiguous to it, but as it penetrates through the <hi>Pores</hi> of the
<hi>Skin,</hi> thereinto; and so mixing with the <hi>Juyces</hi> thereof, plainly deys
or strikes them into a <hi>Green.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. §. By the <hi>Aer</hi> from within, I mean, that which entring, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the <hi>Aliment,</hi> at the <hi>Root,</hi> thence ascends by the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi>
into the <hi>Trunk</hi> and <hi>Leaves,</hi> and is there transfused into all the several
<hi>Juyces,</hi> thereby likewise concurring to their <hi>Verdure.</hi> Whence it is, that
the <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> which lie under <hi>Water,</hi> are <hi>Green,</hi> as well as those
which stand above it; because, though the ambient <hi>Aer,</hi> conteined in
the <hi>Water</hi> be but little, yet the want of it is compensated, by that
which ascends from the <hi>Root.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. §. And therefore it is observable, that the <hi>Stalks</hi> of <hi>Marsh-Mallow,</hi>
and some other <hi>Plants,</hi> being cut transversly, though the
<hi>Parenchyma</hi> in the <hi>Barque</hi> be <hi>white,</hi> yet the <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> which lie within
that <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> are as <hi>Green</hi> as the <hi>Skin</hi> it self; <hi>scil.</hi> because they
stand close to the <hi>Aer-Vessels.</hi> The <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> I say, which is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
from the <hi>Aer,</hi> without, by the <hi>Skin;</hi> and from the <hi>Aer</hi> within,
by the <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi> is <hi>white:</hi> but the <hi>Skin,</hi> which is exposed to the <hi>Aer</hi>
without, and the <hi>Sap-Vessels</hi> which are next neighbours to that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
are both equally <hi>Green.</hi> So likewise if a <hi>Carrot</hi> be plucked up, and
suffered to lie sometime in the open <hi>Aer;</hi> that part which standeth in
and near the <hi>Centre,</hi> amongst the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> will become <hi>Green</hi> as well
as the <hi>Skin,</hi> all the other <hi>Parts</hi> continuing of a <hi>Redish Yellow,</hi> as before.
The <hi>Aer</hi> therefore, both from without, and from within the <hi>Plant,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the <hi>Juyces</hi> of the <hi>Plant,</hi> are all the concurrent <hi>Causes</hi> of its
<hi>Verdure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:100350:161"/>
11. §. BUT how doth the <hi>Aer</hi> concur to the <hi>Greeness</hi> of <hi>Plants?</hi>
I answer; Not as it is meerly either <hi>cold</hi> or <hi>dry,</hi> or <hi>moist,</hi> nor yet <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus
Aer;</hi> but as it is a mixed, and particularly, a <hi>Saline Body:</hi> that
is, as there is a considerable quantity of <hi>Saline Parts</hi> mixed with those
which are properly <hi>Aereal.</hi> It being plain from manifold Experience;
That the several kinds of <hi>Salts,</hi> are the grand <hi>Agents</hi> in the <hi>Variation</hi> of
<hi>Colours.</hi> So that, to speak strictly, although <hi>Sulphur</hi> be indeed the
<hi>Female,</hi> or <hi>Materia substrata,</hi> of all <hi>Colours;</hi> yet <hi>Salt</hi> is the <hi>Male</hi> or
<hi>Prime Agent,</hi> by which the <hi>Sulphur</hi> is determined to the <hi>Production</hi> of
one <hi>Colour,</hi> and not of another.</p>
                  <p>12. §. If then it be the <hi>Aer</hi> mixed with the <hi>Juyces</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> and
the <hi>Salt</hi> of the <hi>Aer,</hi> that makes it <hi>Green;</hi> It may further be asked, what
kind of <hi>Salt?</hi> But this is more hard to judge of. Yet it seemeth, that
it is not an <hi>Acid,</hi> but a <hi>Subalkaline Salt;</hi> or at least some <hi>Salt</hi> which
is different from a simple <hi>Acid,</hi> and hath an <hi>Affinity</hi> with <hi>Alkalies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. §. One reason why I so judge, is, Because that although all
<hi>Plants</hi> yield an <hi>Alkaly,</hi> or other <hi>Salt</hi> different from an <hi>Acid,</hi> and some
in good quantity; yet in most <hi>Plants,</hi> the <hi>Praedominant Principle</hi> is
an <hi>Acid.</hi> So that the <hi>Supply</hi> of an <hi>Acid Principle</hi> from the <hi>Aer,</hi> for
the <hi>Production</hi> of a <hi>Green Colour,</hi> as it would be superfluous; So also
ineffectual: a different <hi>Principle</hi> being requisite to the striking of this,
together with the <hi>Sulphur,</hi> into a <hi>Green Colour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. §. I suppose therefore, That not only <hi>Green,</hi> but all the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours</hi>
of <hi>Plants,</hi> are a kind of <hi>Precipitate,</hi> resulting from the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the <hi>Saline Parts</hi> of the <hi>Aer,</hi> with the <hi>Saline</hi> and <hi>Sulphurious
Parts</hi> of the <hi>Plant;</hi> and that the <hi>Subalkaline,</hi> or other like <hi>Saline Part</hi>
of the <hi>Aer,</hi> is concurrent with the <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Sulphurious Parts</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi>
for the <hi>Production</hi> of their <hi>Verdure;</hi> that is, as they strike altogether
into a <hi>Green Precipitate.</hi> Which also seemeth to be confirmed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<hi>Experiments</hi> hereafter mentioned.</p>
                  <p>15. §. THE <hi>Colours</hi> of <hi>Flowers</hi> are various; differing therein not
only from the <hi>Leaf,</hi> but one from another. Yet all seem to depend
upon the general <hi>Causes</hi> aforesaid. And therefore the <hi>Colours</hi> of <hi>Flowers,</hi>
as well as of <hi>Leaves,</hi> to result not solely from the <hi>Contents</hi> of the <hi>Plant,</hi>
but from the concurrence likewise of the <hi>ambient Aer.</hi> Hence it is,
that as they gradually open, and are exposed to the <hi>Aer,</hi> they still either
acquire, or change their <hi>Colour:</hi> no <hi>Flower</hi> having its proper <hi>Colour</hi> in
the <hi>Bud,</hi> (though it be then perfectly formed) but only when it is
expanded. So the <hi>Purple Flower</hi> of <hi>Stock-July Flowers,</hi> while they
are in the <hi>Bud,</hi> are <hi>white,</hi> or <hi>pale.</hi> So <hi>Butchelors Buttons, Blew Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
Poppy, Red Daisies,</hi> and many others, though of divers <hi>Colours</hi>
when blown, yet are all <hi>white</hi> in the <hi>Bud.</hi> And many <hi>Flowers</hi> do
thus change their <hi>Colours</hi> thrice successively; as the youngest <hi>Buds</hi> of
<hi>Ladys-Lookinglass, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ugloss</hi> and the like, are all white, the larger <hi>Buds</hi>
are <hi>purple</hi> or <hi>murrey,</hi> and the open <hi>Flowers, blew:</hi> according as they
come still neerer, and are longer exposed, to the <hi>Aer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>16. §. But if the <hi>Colour</hi> of the <hi>Flower</hi> dependeth on the <hi>ambient
Aer;</hi> it may be asked: How it comes to pass then, that this <hi>Colour</hi> is
various, and not one, and that one, a <hi>Green?</hi> that is to say that all
<hi>Flowers</hi> are not <hi>Green,</hi> as well as the <hi>Leaves?</hi> In answer to this Three
things are to be premised.</p>

                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:100350:162"/>
17. §. <hi>First,</hi> What was said before, is to be remembred, that here
the <hi>Aer</hi> is not a solitary, but concurrent <hi>Cause.</hi> So that besides the
<hi>Efficacy</hi> of this, we are to consider that of the several parts of the <hi>Plant,</hi>
by which the <hi>Contents</hi> both <hi>Aereal</hi> and <hi>Liquid</hi> are supplied to the
<hi>Flower.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. §. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That in the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> of a <hi>Plant, Sulphur</hi> is
the <hi>predominant Principle,</hi> and much more abounding than in any other
<hi>part</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> as also hath been formerly shewed.</p>
                  <p>19. §. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it appears, according to what we have observed
in the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of the <hi>Flower,</hi> That the quantity of <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> with
respect to the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> is greater in the <hi>Flower</hi> than in the <hi>Leaf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. §. It semeth therefore, that the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> and therefore the
<hi>Aer,</hi> being <hi>predominant</hi> in the <hi>Leaf; Green,</hi> is therein also the <hi>predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
Colour.</hi> I say <hi>predominant,</hi> because there are other <hi>Colours</hi>
lye vailed under the <hi>Green,</hi> even in the <hi>Leafe,</hi> as will hereafter appear
more manifest.</p>
                  <p>21. §. On the contrary, the <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi>
being more, and the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> and therefore the <hi>Aer,</hi> less, in
the <hi>Flower</hi> than in the <hi>Leaf;</hi> the <hi>ambient Aer</hi> alone is not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole
the <hi>Sulphur</hi> so far, but that it generally carrys the greatest port
in the <hi>Production</hi> of the <hi>Colour.</hi> Yet in different degrees; For if
the proportion betwixt the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> and the <hi>Aer-Vessels</hi> be more
equal, the <hi>Flower</hi> is either <hi>White</hi> or else <hi>Yellow,</hi> which latter <hi>Colour</hi> is
the next of kin to a <hi>Green.</hi> If the <hi>Sulphur</hi> be somewhat <hi>predominant,</hi>
the <hi>Flower</hi> will shew it self <hi>Red</hi> at first; but the <hi>ambient Aer</hi> hath so
much power upon it, as gradually to turn the <hi>Red</hi> into a <hi>Blew.</hi> But
if the <hi>Sulphur</hi> be much <hi>predominant,</hi> then the <hi>Acid</hi> of the <hi>ambient Aer</hi>
will heighten it to a fixed <hi>Red.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>22. §. Hence it is, that <hi>Yellows</hi> and <hi>Greens</hi> are less alterable, upon
the drying of <hi>Plants</hi> than other <hi>Colours; sc.</hi> Because the <hi>Aer</hi> being <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant</hi>
in their <hi>Production,</hi> they are the less lyable to suffer from it
afterwards. Whereas <hi>Reds</hi> and <hi>Purples,</hi> in the <hi>Production</hi> whereof
<hi>Sulphur</hi> is <hi>predominant,</hi> are very changeable. So the <hi>Red</hi> Flowers of
<hi>Lysimachia,</hi> upon drying, turn <hi>Purple,</hi> and the young <hi>purple Flowers</hi> of
<hi>gloss</hi> turn <hi>Blew.</hi> So likewise the <hi>Purple</hi> of <hi>Bilberries,</hi> and the <hi>Crimson</hi>
of baked <hi>Damascens,</hi> both turn <hi>Blew.</hi> For being gathered, and so wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a continued supply of fresh <hi>Sulphur,</hi> to bear up the <hi>Colour</hi> against
the force of the <hi>Aer;</hi> it strikes it down at last from <hi>Red</hi> to <hi>Purple</hi> or
<hi>Blew.</hi> I conclude therefore, that one <hi>Principal Cause</hi> of the <hi>Variety</hi> of
<hi>Colours</hi> in the <hi>Flower,</hi> is the over proportion of the <hi>Lympheducts</hi> to
the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> and therefore the dominion of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> over the
<hi>Aer,</hi> therein.</p>
                  <p>23. §. If it be objected, that the <hi>Aer</hi> doth not deepen, but highten
the <hi>Colour</hi> of the <hi>Blood:</hi> I answer, <hi>First,</hi> That I am not now speaking
of <hi>Animal,</hi> but of <hi>Vegetable Bodies;</hi> the same <hi>Aer</hi> which hightens the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi>
of <hi>Blood</hi> one way, may deepen that of a <hi>Flower,</hi> another: nay and
may highten that of some <hi>Flowers</hi> too, some other way.</p>
                  <p>24. §. And therefore, <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is to be considered, That as
there is not one only, but divers <hi>Saline Principles</hi> in the <hi>Aer;</hi> so are
there also in the several <hi>Parts</hi> of one <hi>Plant;</hi> as in the <hi>Root,</hi> of one sort;
in the <hi>Leavs,</hi> of another; in the <hi>Flower,</hi> of another; and so in the
other <hi>Parts.</hi> For since the <hi>Figuration</hi> of the <hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Plant</hi> dependeth
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:100350:162"/>
chiefly upon the <hi>Saline Principles:</hi> and that the <hi>Flower</hi> hath a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<hi>Figure</hi> from that of the <hi>Leaf:</hi> it follows, that there is some <hi>Saline
Principle</hi> in the one, which is not in the other, especially, all in such
<hi>Flowers,</hi> whose <hi>Figures</hi> are cut out by a greater <hi>Variety</hi> and <hi>Complication</hi>
of <hi>Lines.</hi> The <hi>Leavs</hi> therefore, though variously shaped, yet agreeing
so far in one common <hi>Figure,</hi> as usualy to be <hi>flat;</hi> it therefore seemeth
plain, that there is a <hi>Saline Principle</hi> in them all, so far <hi>one,</hi> as to be the
chief <hi>Cause</hi> of that common <hi>Figure:</hi> and in concurrence with the <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Aer,</hi> to be likewise the chief <hi>Cause</hi> of one common <hi>Colour, sc.</hi> a <hi>Green.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>25. §. Whereas the <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Flowers,</hi> and therefore their
<hi>Saline Principle,</hi> being more various, and commonly distinct from that
of the <hi>Leaf;</hi> it will easily concur with as a great <hi>Variety</hi> of <hi>Salts</hi> in
the <hi>Aer,</hi> whether <hi>Acid, Alkaline, Nitrous, Urinous, Armoniacal,</hi> or
any other therein existent, to the <hi>Precipitation</hi> of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> into
the like <hi>Variety</hi> of <hi>Colours.</hi> Thus far of the <hi>Colours</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> as they
appear in their <hi>Natural Estate.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Of the COLOURS of Plants by Infusion.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE next general <hi>Inquiry,</hi> proposed to be made, was
this, After what manner the <hi>Colours</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> shew
themselves, upon their <hi>infusion</hi> into <hi>Liquors.</hi> The <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors</hi>
I made use of for this purpose, were three, <hi>sc.
Oyl</hi> of <hi>Olives, Water,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine.</hi> The <hi>Water</hi> I
used was from the <hi>Thames,</hi> because I could not
procure any clear <hi>Rain Water,</hi> and had not leasure
at present to distill any. But next to this, that yields as little <hi>Salt,</hi> as any.</p>
                  <p>2. §. As for <hi>Oyl,</hi> it is known, that most <hi>Plants</hi> either by <hi>Coction</hi>
or long <hi>Infusion,</hi> will give it their <hi>Green Colour.</hi> I have likewise tryed
some <hi>Yellows,</hi> and find they will do indifferently well; as <hi>Saffron,</hi>
which, by <hi>Infusion</hi> in <hi>Oyl,</hi> gives it a light golden <hi>Tincture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. §. Divers <hi>Aromatick Plants,</hi> as <hi>Mint, Majorane,</hi> &amp;c. being
dryed and infused in <hi>Oyl</hi> give it a double <hi>Tincture,</hi> both <hi>green</hi> and <hi>yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;</hi>
one drop of the <hi>Oyl</hi> shewing <hi>green;</hi> but a good quantity of it
held up against a candle looketh <hi>redish</hi> or of a deep <hi>yellow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. §. But there is no <hi>Vegetable</hi> yet known which gives a true <hi>Red</hi> to
<hi>Oyl,</hi> except <hi>Alkanet Root:</hi> with which, some colouring either common
or other <hi>Oyl,</hi> vend it under the name of the <hi>Red Oyl</hi> of <hi>Scorpions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. §. These things confirm what we have said concerning the <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
of <hi>Colours</hi> in the <hi>Leavs</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Discourse</hi> of <hi>Mixture</hi> Ch. 5. Inst. 2. §. 3. &amp; Inst. 5.</note> upon this twofold
Consideration. <hi>First,</hi> that <hi>Oyl</hi> is the most proper <hi>Menstruum</hi> of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur.
Secondly,</hi> that <hi>Oyls</hi> have a greater congruity with <hi>Acids</hi> than
with <hi>Alkalies;</hi> as I have formerly shewed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:100350:163"/>
6. §. I say therefore, that in <hi>Blews, Purples</hi> and especially <hi>Reds,</hi>
the <hi>predominant Principles</hi> being <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Acid,</hi> the <hi>Oyl</hi> either ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracts
the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of it self, or at least, unlocks it from the <hi>Acid Parts;</hi>
whereby both of them are bestowed seperately to their like parts in
the <hi>Oyl;</hi> upon which their disunion the <hi>Colour</hi> vanishes: that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending,
not upon either of them alone, which of themselves are <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourless,</hi>
but upon both united together.</p>
                  <p>7. §. On the contrary, a <hi>Green Colour</hi> not depending on a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
Acid,</hi> but an <hi>Alkaly,</hi> or some <hi>Saline Principle</hi> different from an
<hi>Acid;</hi> this will not so easiely be imbibed separately, into the <hi>Pores</hi> of the
<hi>Oyl,</hi> but only by mediation of their <hi>Sulphur.</hi> So that being both imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
without any disunion, they still retein the same <hi>green Colour</hi> they
had before in the <hi>Plant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. §. Hence also it is, that <hi>red Roses</hi> being dryed and infused some
time in <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Anise Seeds,</hi> a more potent <hi>Menstruum</hi> than <hi>Common Oyl;</hi>
they wholly lose their own <hi>Colour,</hi> and turn <hi>white;</hi> the <hi>Oyl</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Limpid,</hi> as at the first. That is the <hi>Sulphur</hi> or that part of it on
which cheifly the <hi>Red</hi> depended, is absorbed separately by the <hi>Oyl,</hi> and
so the <hi>Colour</hi> vanishes.</p>
                  <p>9. §. A SECOND <hi>Menstruum</hi> I made use of, was <hi>Water.</hi> And <hi>First,
Alkanet Root,</hi> which immediately tinctures <hi>Oyl</hi> with a deeper <hi>Red,</hi>
will not colour <hi>Water</hi> in the least.</p>
                  <p>10. §. Next it is observable, That <hi>Water</hi> will take all the <hi>Colours</hi>
of <hi>Plants</hi> in <hi>Infusion</hi> except a <hi>Green.</hi> So that as no <hi>Plant</hi> will by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion</hi>
give a perfect <hi>Blew</hi> to <hi>Oyl;</hi> so their is none, that I know of,
which, by <hi>Infusion</hi> will give a perfect <hi>Green</hi> to <hi>Water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. §. But although the <hi>Green Leavs</hi> will not give their <hi>visible
Colour,</hi> by <hi>Infusion</hi> in <hi>Water;</hi> yet they will give most other <hi>Colours,</hi> as
well as the <hi>Flowers</hi> themselves. So the <hi>Green Leavs</hi> of <hi>Cinquefoyl,</hi>
give a <hi>Tincture</hi> no higher than to resemble <hi>Rhenish Wine;</hi> those of
<hi>Hyssop, Canary;</hi> of <hi>Strawberrey, Malaga;</hi> of <hi>Mint, Muscadine;</hi> of
<hi>Wood-Sorrel, Water</hi> and some drops of <hi>Claret;</hi> of <hi>Blood-wort, Water</hi>
and a dash of <hi>Claret;</hi> and those of <hi>Bawm</hi> make a <hi>Tincture</hi> near as <hi>red</hi>
as ordinary <hi>Claret</hi> alone. All <hi>Aromatick</hi> hot <hi>Plants,</hi> give a <hi>yellow-red
Tincture,</hi> or <hi>colorem ex luteo rubrum.</hi> All <hi>Plants</hi> with a <hi>yellow Flower</hi>
give either a pale <hi>citrine</hi> or <hi>yellowish Tincture;</hi> and the like. Yet all
give not their <hi>Tincture</hi> in the same space of time; some requiring a
fortnight, others a week, others five, three or two days, and some
but one, or half a day. From hence it appears, that the <hi>Colours</hi> of
most <hi>Flowers</hi> are begun in the <hi>Leavs;</hi> only <hi>Green</hi> being therein the
<hi>predominant Colour,</hi> as a <hi>veil</hi> spred over them, conceils all the rest.
But passing on into the <hi>Flower,</hi> where the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> as is aforesaid,
are under the dominion of the <hi>Lymphaeductss</hi> they shew themselves
distinctly.</p>
                  <p>12. §. A THIRD and the last <hi>Menstruum</hi> I made use of, was <hi>Spirit</hi>
of <hi>Wine.</hi> And here it is to be remarqued; That as <hi>Oyl</hi> rarely takes a
<hi>Red,</hi> there being but one known <hi>Instance</hi> of it; nor <hi>Water,</hi> a <hi>Green:</hi>
So neither <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> a <hi>Blew.</hi> I have tryed with several <hi>blew
Flowers,</hi> as of <hi>Lark-heel, Violet, Mallows, Burrage,</hi> and others, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it will not take the least <hi>Tincture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. §. Again though no <hi>Blew Flowers,</hi> that I know of, will give a
<hi>Blew Tincture</hi> to <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine:</hi> yet having been for some days infused
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:100350:163"/>
in the said <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> still remaining in a manner <hi>Limpid,</hi>
and void of the least <hi>Ray</hi> of <hi>Blew;</hi> if you drop into it a little <hi>Spirit</hi>
of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> it is somewhat snrprizing to see, that it immediately strikes
it into a full <hi>Red,</hi> as if it had been <hi>Blew</hi> before: and so, if you drop
<hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> or other <hi>Alkaly</hi> upon it, it presently strikes it
<hi>Green.</hi> Which further confirms what have been before said of the <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
of <hi>Vegetable Colours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. §. It is also observable, That the <hi>Green Leaves</hi> of <hi>Bawm,</hi> which
give a <hi>Muscadine Red,</hi> with some <hi>Rays</hi> of <hi>Claret,</hi> to <hi>Water,</hi> gives a pure
and perfect <hi>Green</hi> to <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine:</hi> and is the only <hi>Plant</hi> of all
that I have yet tryed, which doth the like.</p>
                  <p>15. §. It is likewise to be noted, That both <hi>Yellow</hi> and <hi>Red Flowers</hi>
give a stronger and fuller <hi>Tincture</hi> to <hi>Water,</hi> than to <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine;</hi>
as in the <hi>Tinctures</hi> of <hi>Cowslip, Poppys, Clove-July-Flowers</hi> and <hi>Roses,</hi>
made both in <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> and compared together, is
easily seen. So that for <hi>Tinctures</hi> made with <hi>Flowers,</hi> whether for <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,</hi>
or other purposes, <hi>Water,</hi> with respect to the <hi>Colour,</hi> is the better
<hi>Menstruum.</hi> I say for <hi>Tinctures</hi> made with <hi>Flowers;</hi> for there are
some other <hi>Parts,</hi> especially <hi>Gumms,</hi> as <hi>Gamboja, Myrrh</hi> and <hi>Aloes,</hi>
which give their <hi>Tinctures</hi> full and clear, only to <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine.</hi> Some
of which are used by <hi>Leather-Gilders,</hi> and others, for the washing over
of <hi>Silver,</hi> so as to give it the <hi>Colour</hi> of <hi>Gold.</hi> Thus far of the <hi>Colours</hi>
of <hi>Plants</hi> as they appear upon <hi>Infusion.</hi>

in <hi>Greens,</hi> so <hi>Acids</hi> in <hi>Reds,</hi> especially in the brighter <hi>Reds,</hi> in
the <hi>Leavs</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi> Hence it is, that <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre</hi>
droped upon the <hi>Blew Flower</hi> of <hi>Ladies Looking-Glass, Larkspur, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,</hi>
turns them all <hi>Red, sc.</hi> into the <hi>Red</hi> of <hi>Common Lychnis.</hi> But
(which is particularly to be noted) being droped on the said <hi>Red
Flowers</hi> of <hi>Lychnis,</hi> alters them little or nothing: because, that very
<hi>Colour</hi> is therein produced by a copious admixture of the like <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>16. §. The Summ therefore of what hath now been said, of the
<hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Vegetable Colours,</hi> is this: That while their <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Saline
Principles,</hi> only swim together, and are not as yet united into one <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate,</hi>
no <hi>Colour</hi> results from them, but the <hi>Contents</hi> are rather
<hi>Limpid;</hi> as usually in the <hi>Root,</hi> and many other <hi>Parenchymous
Parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. §. When they are united, and the <hi>Alkaline</hi> are <hi>predominant,</hi>
they produce a <hi>Green.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. §. When the <hi>Sulphur</hi> and the <hi>Alkaline</hi> are more equal, they
produce a <hi>Tauny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>19. §. When the <hi>Sulphur, Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkaline,</hi> there a <hi>Yellow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. §. When the <hi>Sulphur predominant,</hi> and the <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkaline</hi>
equal, there a <hi>Blew.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. §. When the <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Acid</hi> are <hi>predominant</hi> to the <hi>Alkaline,</hi>
then a <hi>Purple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>22. §. When the <hi>Sulphur predominant</hi> to the <hi>Alkaline</hi> and the <hi>Acid</hi>
to them both, a <hi>Scarlet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:100350:164"/>
23. §. <hi>Lastly,</hi> When the <hi>Acid predominant</hi> to the <hi>Alkaline,</hi> and the
<hi>Sulphur</hi> to them both, a <hi>Blood-Red:</hi> which is the highest and most
<hi>Sulphurious Colour</hi> in Nature.</p>
                  <p>24. §. From the <hi>Premises,</hi> divers Rules do also result for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of <hi>Tinctures,</hi> either for <hi>Medicines,</hi> or for any other purposes.</p>
                  <p>25. §. I shall only add one or two Notes. As first, that of all
<hi>Colours, Yellows</hi> are the most fixed and unfading. As for instance, if
you drop either a <hi>Solution</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> or of <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Sulphur</hi> upon a
<hi>Tincture</hi> of the <hi>Yellow Flowers</hi> of <hi>Crowfoot,</hi> of <hi>Adonis,</hi> or of <hi>Saffron,</hi>
neither of them will alter their <hi>Colour.</hi> Which shewes the strength
of most <hi>Yellows,</hi> to resist all manner of impressions from the <hi>Aer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>26. §. Again, that the use of <hi>Salts,</hi> is not only to highten or
deepen <hi>Colours,</hi> but also to fix and make them permanent. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
The <hi>Tincture</hi> of <hi>Clove-July-Flowers,</hi> made either with <hi>Water</hi>
or <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> being exposed to the <hi>Aer,</hi> will often turn into a
<hi>Blackish Purple.</hi> But the addition of a few drops of <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Sulphur,</hi>
doth not only highten the <hi>Colour,</hi> but renders it stable and permanent.</p>
                  <p>27. §. Likewise, of <hi>Salts</hi> themselves there is choice to be made.
For there are some, which although they fix the <hi>Colour,</hi> yet, will a
little <hi>give,</hi> as we say, and not hold throughly dry; as most <hi>Lixivial
Salts,</hi> and <hi>Stillatious Acids.</hi> But there are some <hi>Salts,</hi> which will
not <hi>give</hi> in the least, as <hi>Alum,</hi> that in <hi>Lime-Water</hi> and some others;
which latter, is so far from being moystened, that it is rather petrified
by the <hi>Aer.</hi> For which reason I take it to be one of the best <hi>Liquors</hi>
for a stable and permanent <hi>Green,</hi> and some other <hi>Colours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>28. §. Amongst all <hi>Water-Colours,</hi> the rarest, and most difficult
to make clear bright and permanent, is a <hi>Blew.</hi> There are many <hi>Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
of an excellent <hi>Blew,</hi> as those of <hi>Bugloss, Lark-heel</hi> and others; but
they easily fade. And there are very few <hi>Flowers</hi> that will strike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>Blew</hi> by any <hi>Liquor;</hi> being almost all changeable into <hi>Green,
Purple</hi> or <hi>Red.</hi> Yet some few there are, in which this <hi>Colour</hi> may be
produced. As for instance, the <hi>Flower</hi> of <hi>Lathyrus</hi> or <hi>Parseverlasting;</hi>
which upon the affusion of <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Harts-Horn</hi> is changed from a
<hi>Peach,</hi> to as pure a <hi>Blew,</hi> as the best <hi>Ultramarine:</hi> that which hitherto
is, I think, wanting in <hi>Water Colours. Spirit</hi> of <hi>Harts Horn</hi> was the
<hi>Liquor</hi> I used; but I question not, but that other <hi>Alkalies,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<hi>Lime-Water,</hi> will have the like Effect, and so render it the
more stable.</p>
                  <p>29. §. From what hath been said, we may likewise be confirmed
in the use of the already known <hi>Rules,</hi> and directed unto others yet
unknown, in order to the variation of the <hi>Colours</hi> of <hi>Flowers</hi> in their
Growth. The effecting of this, by putting the <hi>Colour</hi> desired in the
<hi>Flower,</hi> into the <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Root</hi> of the <hi>Plant,</hi> is vainly talked of by
some: being such a piece of cunning, as for the obteining a painted
face, to eat good store of <hi>white</hi> and <hi>Red Lead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>30. §. The best known <hi>Rules</hi> are these Two; First, that the
<hi>Seed</hi> be used above any other part, if the variation of the <hi>Colour</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
One reason whereof is, because that part being but very small,
the <hi>Tinctures</hi> of the <hi>Soyl</hi> will have the greater over proportion to those
of the <hi>Seed.</hi> Besides, the tender and <hi>Virgin Seed,</hi> being committed to
the Soyl, will more easily take any peculiar <hi>Tincture</hi> from it, then an
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:100350:165"/>
other <hi>Part,</hi> which is not so susceptive, and hath been tinctur'd already.
All the strange varieties in <hi>Carnations, Tulips,</hi> and other <hi>Flowers</hi> are
made this way.</p>
                  <p>31. §. The other <hi>Rule</hi> is, To change the <hi>Soyl,</hi> or frequently to
transplant from one <hi>Bed</hi> to another. By which means, the <hi>Plant,</hi> is as
it were, <hi>superimpregnated</hi> with several <hi>Tinctures,</hi> which are prolifick
of several <hi>Colours;</hi> which way is taken for <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Slips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>32. §. The consideration whereof, and of the foregoing <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
may direct us not only in changing the <hi>Bed,</hi> but also in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
the <hi>Soyl,</hi> as by mixing such and such <hi>Salts,</hi> or <hi>Bodies</hi> impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
with such <hi>Salts,</hi> I say by mixing these Bodies in such a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with the <hi>Soyl,</hi> as although they have no <hi>Colour</hi> in themselves, yet
may be effectual to produce a great variety of <hi>Colours</hi> in the <hi>Plants</hi> they
nourish; supplying the <hi>Plants</hi> with such <hi>Tinctures,</hi> as shall concur
with the <hi>Aer,</hi> to strike or precipitate their <hi>Sulphur</hi> into so many seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Colours,</hi> after the manner above explicated: and so to bring even
Natures Art of <hi>Painting,</hi> in a great part, into our own power.</p>

TASTS

                  <head>CHAP. I. Of the several Sorts of SIMPLE and COMPOUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DED

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE formerly published some Notes,<note place="margin">Idea, §. 29. <hi>&amp;</hi> Anat. <hi>of</hi> R. P. 2. §. 68, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Tasts.</hi> Since then, I have made other <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
upon the same Subject: and these have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
further <hi>Thoughts.</hi> I will summ up all in give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an account, First, of the <hi>Diversities;</hi> and then,
of the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Tasts,</hi> chiefly in <hi>Plants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. §. The <hi>Diversities</hi> of <hi>Tasts</hi> are so many, and
so considerable; that it seemeth strange, to see the matter treated of
both by <hi>Philosophers</hi> and <hi>Physicians,</hi> with so much scantness and defect.
For the <hi>Subject</hi> is not barren, but yieldeth much and pleasant <hi>Variety.</hi>
And doth also appear to be of great import unto <hi>Medicine.</hi> Besides,
it is preposterous to discourse of the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Tasts,</hi> before we have
taken an account of their <hi>Diversities;</hi> Whereof therefore I shall in the
first place, exhibit the following <hi>Scheme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:100350:166"/>
3. §. TASTS may be distinguished by these Three general ways.
First, with respect to the <hi>Sensation</hi> it self. Secondly, with respect to
its <hi>Duration</hi> and <hi>Terms.</hi> Thirdly, with respect to its <hi>Subject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. §. The <hi>Sensation</hi> it self is differenced two ways, by its <hi>Species,</hi>
and by its <hi>Degrees.</hi> With respect to the <hi>Species, Tasts</hi> are <hi>Simple,</hi> or
<hi>Compounded.</hi> By <hi>Simple Tasts,</hi> I mean not such, as are never found in
conjunction with other <hi>Tasts:</hi> but the <hi>Simple</hi> or <hi>Single Modes</hi> of <hi>Tast,</hi>
although they are mixed with divers others in the same <hi>Body.</hi> As for
example, the <hi>Taste</hi> of a <hi>Peppin,</hi> is <hi>Acidulcis;</hi> of <hi>Rhubarb, Amarastrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens;</hi>
and therefore <hi>Compounded</hi> in both. Yet in the <hi>Peppin,</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid</hi>
is one <hi>Simple Taste,</hi> and the <hi>Sweet</hi> another; and so in <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> the
<hi>Bitter</hi> is one <hi>Simple Taste,</hi> and the <hi>Astringent</hi> is another.</p>
                  <p>5. §. Two faults have here been committed; the defective <hi>Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration</hi>
of <hi>Simple Tast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>;</hi> and reckoning them indistinctly among some
others which are <hi>Compounded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. §. SIMPLE <hi>Tasts,</hi> (of which, properly so called, there
are commonly reckoned but Six or Seven Sorts,) are, at least Sixteen.
<hi>Fist, Bitter,</hi> as in <hi>Wormwood:</hi> to which, the contrary is <hi>Sweet,</hi> as in <hi>Sugar.
Thirdly, Sower,</hi> as in <hi>Vinegar:</hi> to which, the contrary is <hi>Salt. Fifthly,
Hot,</hi> as in <hi>Cloves:</hi> whereto, the contrary is <hi>Cold.</hi> For we may as
properly say, a <hi>Cold Taste,</hi> as a <hi>Hot Taste:</hi> there being some <hi>Bodies,</hi>
which do manifestly impress the <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Cold</hi> upon the <hi>Tongue,</hi> though
not by <hi>Touch.</hi> So doth <hi>Sal Prunellae,</hi> although the <hi>Liquor</hi> wherein it
is dissolved, be first warmed.</p>
                  <p>7. §. <hi>Seventhly, Aromatick.</hi> For it doth not more properly agree
to an <hi>Odour,</hi> than a <hi>Taste,</hi> to be <hi>Aromatick.</hi> And that an <hi>Aromatick
Taste,</hi> is dinstinct from an <hi>Hot,</hi> is clear; In that, there are many <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
of a <hi>Hot Taste,</hi> some meanly and others vehemently <hi>Hot;</hi> which yet
are not in the least <hi>Aromatick:</hi> as amongst others, is apparent in <hi>Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium.</hi>
So that although an <hi>Aromatick Taste</hi> be often conjoyned with
<hi>Heat;</hi> yet it is not that <hi>Heat</hi> it self, but another distinct <hi>Sense.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. §. <hi>Eighthly, Nauseous</hi> or <hi>Malignant,</hi> contrary to the former.
Such as is perceived, together with the <hi>Astringent</hi> and <hi>Bitter,</hi> in <hi>Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb;</hi>
or with the <hi>Bitter,</hi> and <hi>Sweet,</hi> in <hi>Aloes.</hi> It may be called <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
because distastful although mixed in a low degree with other
<hi>Tasts:</hi> whereas other <hi>Tasts</hi> will render one another grateful.</p>
                  <p>9. §. Again, <hi>Tasts</hi> may properly be said, to be <hi>Soft</hi> or <hi>Hard.</hi> A
<hi>Soft Taste,</hi> is either <hi>Vapid,</hi> as in <hi>Watery Bodies, Whites</hi> of <hi>Eggs, Starch,
Fine Boles,</hi> &amp;c. Or <hi>Unctuous,</hi> as in <hi>Oyls, Fat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>10. §. <hi>A</hi> Hard Taste <hi>is Fourfold,</hi> sc. Penetrant, Stupifacient,
Astringent, Pungent. <hi>Contrary to a</hi> Vapid, <hi>are</hi> Penetrant <hi>and</hi> Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facient.</p>
                  <p>11. §. <hi>Penetrant,</hi> is a kind of <hi>Taste,</hi> which worketh it self into the
<hi>Tongue</hi> (as some <hi>Insects</hi> into the <hi>Skin</hi>) without any <hi>Pungency;</hi> as in
the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Leavs</hi> of <hi>Wild Cucumer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. §. <hi>Stupifacient,</hi> as in the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Black Hellebore.</hi> Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
chew'd, and for sometime reteined upon the <hi>Tongue;</hi> after a few
minutes, it seemeth to be benum'd and affected with a kind of <hi>Paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Stupor;</hi> or as when it hath been a little burnt with eating or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of any thing too hot.</p>
                  <p>13. §. Contrary to an <hi>Unctuous Taste,</hi> are <hi>Astringent,</hi> and <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;</hi>
as in <hi>Galls,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Sal Aromanick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="281" facs="tcp:100350:166"/>
14. §. Again, <hi>Tasts</hi> are either <hi>Continual,</hi> as most commonly: or
<hi>Intermittent;</hi> as that of <hi>Dracontium,</hi> especially in the <hi>Root.</hi> For after
it seems to be lost and extinguished; it will then again (chiefly upon
the <hi>Collision</hi> of the <hi>Tongue</hi> and <hi>Goomes)</hi> be plainly heightened and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd.</p>
                  <p>15. §. <hi>Lastly, Tasts</hi> are either <hi>Still,</hi> as usually; or may be called
<hi>Tremulous,</hi> as the <hi>Heat</hi> produced by <hi>Pyrethrum. Distinct</hi> from that
of <hi>Cloves, Ginger,</hi> and many other <hi>Hot Bodies,</hi> in that there the <hi>Heat</hi>
is <hi>still;</hi> but here in <hi>Pyrethrum,</hi> 'tis joyned with a kind of <hi>Vibration:</hi>
as when a <hi>Flame</hi> is brandished with a <hi>Lamp-Furnace.</hi> Thus far of the
Sorts of <hi>Simple Tasts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>16. §. COMPOUNDED <hi>Tasts</hi> are very numerous; being
made by the various <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Simple Tasts,</hi> as <hi>Words</hi> are of <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
Sometimes of two, as in <hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi> of <hi>Astringent</hi> and
<hi>Sweet.</hi> Sometimes three, as in <hi>Aloes, Malignant, Bitter</hi> and <hi>Sweet;</hi> in
<hi>Rhubarb, Malignant, Astringent</hi> and <hi>Bitter.</hi> Sometimes four, as in
<hi>Agarick, Malignant, Astringent, Bitter</hi> and <hi>Sweet.</hi> And in some <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
five or six <hi>Species</hi> may be joyned together.</p>
                  <p>17. §. For the more accurate <hi>Observation</hi> whereof, there are these
easie <hi>Rules.</hi> That not too many be tasted at one time: least the <hi>Tongue</hi>
being surcharged, become less critical. That the <hi>Mouth</hi> be washed
with warm water betwixt every tasting. And that those things be
first tasted which produce a less durable <hi>Taste;</hi> that so one may be
throughly extinguished, before another be try'd.</p>
                  <p>18. §. Of the numerous <hi>Conjunctions</hi> of <hi>Tasts,</hi> which may thus be
observed, there are only Six to which the penury of <hi>Language</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
(if I may call them) <hi>Proper Names,</hi> sc. <hi>Acerbus, Austerus, Acris,
Muriaticus, Lixivus &amp; Nitrosus.</hi> Most of which are commonly taken
in to make up the number of <hi>Simple Tasts.</hi> But very improperly; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all of them <hi>Compounded</hi> and <hi>Decompounded Tasts:</hi> to which <hi>Class</hi>
they ought therefore to be refer'd. For</p>
                  <p>19. §. <hi>Austere,</hi> is <hi>Astringent</hi> and <hi>Bitter;</hi> as in the green and soft
<hi>Stones</hi> of <hi>Grapes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. §. <hi>Acerb,</hi> properly so called, is <hi>Astringent</hi> and <hi>Acid;</hi> as in
the <hi>Juyce</hi> of unripe <hi>Grapes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. §. <hi>Acris,</hi> is also <hi>Compounded.</hi> For first, simply <hi>Hot,</hi> it is not:
because there are many <hi>Hot Bodies,</hi> which are not <hi>Acria;</hi> as the <hi>Roots</hi>
of <hi>Zedoary, Yarrow, Contrayerva.</hi> Nor Secondly, is it simply <hi>Pungent,</hi>
because there are also <hi>Bodies,</hi> which are <hi>Non-acria pungentia;</hi> of which
kind is the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Arum.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Acritude,</hi> is <hi>Pungency</hi> joyned
with <hi>Heat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>22. §. <hi>Muriatick,</hi> is <hi>Saltness</hi> joyned with some <hi>Pungency,</hi> as in
common <hi>Salt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>23. §. <hi>Lixivial,</hi> is <hi>Saltness</hi> joyned with <hi>Pungency</hi> and <hi>Heat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. §. <hi>Nitrous,</hi> is <hi>Saltness</hi> joyned with <hi>Pungency</hi> and <hi>Cold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>25. §. Besides these Six, or perhaps one or two more, there are,
as is said, a great number of <hi>Conjuctions,</hi> for which we have no <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Names.</hi>
For admit that there were but <hi>Ten Species</hi> of <hi>Simple Tasts,
sc.</hi> these <hi>Ten; Amarus, Dulcis, Acidus, Salsus, Calidus, Frigidus, Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticus,
Malignus, Astringens, Pungens.</hi> And of these <hi>Ten,</hi> but <hi>Two,</hi>
or at most, but <hi>Three</hi> to be compounded together in any one <hi>Body.</hi>
If only <hi>Two,</hi> they produce 45 <hi>Compounded Tasts.</hi> For the <hi>First,</hi> may
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:100350:167"/>
be compounded with all the 9 following; the <hi>Second,</hi> with all the 8
following; and so, the rest: which together make 45. But if the
same <hi>Ten</hi> be compounded by <hi>Threes</hi> together; they produce no less
than 120 <hi>Variations:</hi> as by the <hi>Table</hi> made of them all doth plainly
appear.</p>
                  <p>26. §. Some few of the <hi>Conjunctions</hi> therein set down, may not
be found actually existent in <hi>Nature.</hi> The abatement of which, will
be much more than compensated two ways. <hi>First,</hi> by the other <hi>Six
Species</hi> of <hi>Simple Tasts,</hi> which are also sometimes compounded. And by
other more complex <hi>Conjunctions,</hi> as of many <hi>Quadruples,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
some <hi>Quintuple</hi> or <hi>Sextuple</hi> ones. Thus far of the <hi>Simple Species,</hi>
and <hi>Conjunctions</hi> of <hi>Tasts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>27. §. THE DEGREES of <hi>Tasts</hi> are also numerous; and
each <hi>Species,</hi> in every <hi>Conjunction,</hi> capable of <hi>Variation</hi> herein. For
the more accurate observing whereof, it will be best, To take those
<hi>Bodies,</hi> whose <hi>Tasts</hi> are, as near as may be, the same in <hi>Specie:</hi> and
that those be first tasted, which are less strong; whereby the true <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi>
will be more precisely taken.</p>
                  <p>28 §. The <hi>Tasts</hi> of <hi>Bodies</hi> will thus appear to be varied, in most
<hi>Species</hi> unto <hi>Five Degrees;</hi> and in some of them, unto <hi>Ten.</hi> So the
<hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Turmerick,</hi> is bitter in the <hi>First Degree;</hi> of <hi>Gentian,</hi> in the
<hi>Tenth.</hi> The <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> is <hi>Hot</hi> in the <hi>First Degree;</hi>
the <hi>Green Pods</hi> or <hi>Seed-Cases</hi> of <hi>Clematis peregrina,</hi> in the <hi>Tenth.</hi> So
that, allowing some to vary under <hi>Five;</hi> yet by a moderate estimate,
we may reckon every <hi>Species,</hi> one with another, to be varied by at
least <hi>Five Degrees.</hi> Which being added to the several <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Tasts,</hi>
in all the <hi>Treble Conjunctions</hi> of the aforesaid <hi>Table,</hi> come to 1800 sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and defineable <hi>Variations</hi> of <hi>Taste.</hi> And these are the <hi>Diversities</hi>
of <hi>Taste,</hi> with respect to the <hi>Sensation</hi> it self.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Of the DURATION and several TERMES
of Tasts.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE next general way of dinguishing <hi>Tasts,</hi> is by
their <hi>Duration,</hi> and their <hi>Terms,</hi> or their <hi>Motion</hi>
of <hi>Intension</hi> and <hi>Remission</hi> from one <hi>Degree</hi> to
another. For there are many <hi>Tasts,</hi> which have
their <hi>Motions</hi> analogous to those of <hi>Diseases;</hi> and
by those may be distinguished in the same manner.
For as of <hi>Diseases,</hi> so of <hi>Tasts,</hi> there are Four
<hi>Times,</hi> as <hi>Physicians</hi> call them, or <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
sc. <hi>Principium, Augmentum, Status, &amp; Declinatio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. §. For the distinct observing of which, those <hi>Bodies</hi> which are
hard, and so their tastable parts less easily extractable by the <hi>Tongue,</hi>
should be reduced to a fine <hi>Powder:</hi> otherwise, the true measure of the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:100350:167"/>
                     <hi>Principium</hi> will be lost. And for the precise measuring of all the <hi>Four
Termes,</hi>
it should be done by a <hi>Minute-Watch</hi> or a <hi>Minute-Glass.</hi> For
so it will appear, that the <hi>Variations</hi> of each, are divers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marquable.</p>
                  <p>3. §. To instance first in those of the <hi>Principium.</hi> Which I call,
That space of time, betwixt the first <hi>Contact</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> to be tasted,
and the first manifest <hi>Perception</hi> of the <hi>Taste.</hi> For Example, those
<hi>Bodies</hi> which are <hi>Acid,</hi> or <hi>Bitter,</hi> as <hi>Vinegar</hi> or <hi>Wormwood,</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
perceiv'd, <hi>quatenus Acid</hi> or <hi>Bitter,</hi> upon the first <hi>Contact;</hi> or
have <hi>Principium brevissimum.</hi> Those <hi>Bodies</hi> which are <hi>Acria,</hi> have
their <hi>Principium</hi> somewhat longer. So the <hi>Seed-Cases</hi> of <hi>Clematis
peregrina,</hi> although they have a vehement <hi>Acritude,</hi> even in the Tenth
<hi>Degree;</hi> yet is not that <hi>Acritude</hi> so soon tasted, as the <hi>Bitterness</hi>
of <hi>Roses,</hi> which is but in the second. But the <hi>Principium</hi> of <hi>Hot
Tasts,</hi> is generally longer than that of any other. So the <hi>Bitterness</hi>
of the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Black-Helebore,</hi> which exceedeth not the second <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi>
is yet presently tasted: but the <hi>Heat</hi> proceeding from the same
<hi>Root,</hi> and which ascendeth to the third <hi>Degree,</hi> is not perceived at all,
till after two full <hi>Minutes.</hi> And so the <hi>Bitterness</hi> of <hi>Enula,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
not the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Degree,</hi> yet is sooner tasted than its <hi>Heat,</hi> which
ascendeth to the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
                  <p>4. §. Next, in those of the <hi>Augment.</hi> Which I call, That space,
betwixt the first <hi>Perception</hi> of the <hi>Taste,</hi> till it become to the heighth.
So the <hi>Heat</hi> of <hi>Galangale,</hi> is not only presently perceived, but ariseth to
the heighth within half a <hi>Minute.</hi> But the <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Enula,</hi>
comes not to the heighth till after a whole <hi>Minute.</hi> And the <hi>Heat</hi> of
<hi>Black-Hellebore,</hi> not till after four full <hi>Minutes</hi> from the first <hi>Contact.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. §. The <hi>Status,</hi> or space wherein the <hi>Taste</hi> continues in its heighth,
is also divers. So the <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>Seed-Case</hi> of <hi>Helleboraster,</hi> comes to
its heighth, and begins to decline within half a <hi>Minute;</hi> that of the
<hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Garden-Scurvygrass,</hi> not till after a <hi>Minute;</hi> and that of the
<hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Asarum,</hi> not till after two full <hi>Minutes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. §. And <hi>Lastly,</hi> the <hi>Declination,</hi> or the space betwixt the first
<hi>Remission</hi> of the <hi>Taste,</hi> and its total <hi>Extinct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>on.</hi> For instance, The <hi>Leavs</hi>
of <hi>Millefolium,</hi> are <hi>Bitter</hi> in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Degree,</hi> and <hi>Hot</hi> only in the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>.
yet the <hi>Heat</hi> continues for sometime, and the <hi>Bitter</hi> presently vanishes.
<hi>Calamus Aromaticus,</hi> is <hi>Bitter</hi> in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Degree, Hot</hi> in the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatick</hi>
in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>: yet the <hi>Bitter</hi> quickly vanishes, the <hi>Heat</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
two <hi>Minutes,</hi> and the <hi>Aromatick</hi> seven or eight. The <hi>Heat</hi> of
the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Contrayerra,</hi> is extended, almost to two <hi>Minutes;</hi> the
<hi>Pungency</hi> of <hi>Jalap,</hi> almost to six; the <hi>Heat</hi> of <hi>Garden Scurvygrass,</hi> to
seven or eight. And even the <hi>Bitteress</hi> of <hi>Wild Cucumer,</hi> to near a
quarter of an hour. But the <hi>Heat</hi> of <hi>Euphorbium</hi> dureth much longer,
as also that of <hi>Black Hellebore. sc.</hi> above half an hour.</p>
                  <p>7. §. So that the <hi>Augmentum,</hi> is seldom extended beyond Four or
Six <hi>Minutes,</hi> from the first <hi>Contact:</hi> but the <hi>Declination,</hi> sometimes to
Thirty, Fourty, or more. Thus far of the <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Tast,</hi> or the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of the SUBJECT or SEAT of Tasts.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Last</hi> way of distinguishing <hi>Tasts,</hi> is
by their <hi>Subject,</hi> or the <hi>Part</hi> or <hi>Parts</hi> where they
are either wholly or chiefly perceived. And so,
<hi>Tasts</hi> are either <hi>Fixed,</hi> or <hi>Movable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. §. A <hi>Fixed Tast,</hi> is that which keepeth
within the compass of some one <hi>Part,</hi> all the time
of its <hi>Duration;</hi> as upon the <hi>Tip,</hi> or the <hi>Root</hi> of
the <hi>Tongue,</hi> or other <hi>Part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. §. A <hi>Movable Taste,</hi> is either <hi>Diffusive</hi> or <hi>Transitive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. §. A <hi>Diffusive Taste,</hi> I call that, which by degrees spreads
abroad into divers <hi>Parts,</hi> and yet in the mean time, adheres to that
<hi>Part</hi> in which it is first perceived. So the <hi>Bitterness</hi> in the dryed <hi>Roots</hi>
of <hi>Black Hellebore,</hi> is first felt on the <hi>Tip</hi> of the <hi>Tongue;</hi> from whence
it spreads it self to the midle of the same. And the <hi>Bitterness</hi> of the
<hi>Leavs</hi> of <hi>Wild Cucumer,</hi> spreads from the <hi>Tip,</hi> to the <hi>Root</hi> of the
<hi>Tongue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. §. A <hi>Transitive Taste,</hi> is that, which after sometime, wholly
quitting the <hi>Part</hi> wherein it is first perceived, is thence transfered into
some other <hi>Part:</hi> as the <hi>Bitterness</hi> of <hi>Gentian,</hi> imediately from the <hi>Tip,</hi>
to the midle of the <hi>Tongue.</hi> And most of the <hi>Diffusive,</hi> are also <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. §. The several <hi>Parts</hi> which these ways become, and with some
latitude may be called, the <hi>Seats</hi> of <hi>Tasts,</hi> are, the <hi>Lips, Tongue, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
Throat</hi> and <hi>Gulet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. §. Upon the <hi>Lips,</hi> the <hi>Root</hi> of white <hi>Hellebore,</hi> as also of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethrum,</hi>
being chewed, make a sensible <hi>Impression;</hi> which continues
(like the flame of a <hi>Coal</hi> betwixt in and out) for 9 or 10 <hi>Minutes.</hi>
But the <hi>Heat</hi> in other <hi>Parts</hi> much longer.</p>
                  <p>8. §. Upon the <hi>Tongue, Tasts</hi> are perceived in Three places, as
hath been intimated. On the <hi>Tip</hi> or <hi>Cone</hi> of the <hi>Tongue;</hi> as most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly.
On or near the <hi>Basis</hi> of the <hi>Tongue;</hi> where the <hi>Taste</hi> of the
<hi>Leavs</hi> of <hi>Wild Cucumer</hi> chiefly fixeth it self. Or on the <hi>Vertex</hi> or midle
of the <hi>Tongue;</hi> in which place it is observable, that the <hi>Tast</hi> of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
Colocynthis,</hi> and divers other <hi>Bodies,</hi> is then considerably strong,
when not at all perceived at the <hi>Tip</hi> of the <hi>Tongue</hi> or in any other <hi>Part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. §. Upon the <hi>Palate</hi> or <hi>Roofe</hi> of the <hi>Mouth,</hi> the <hi>Root,</hi> as I take
it, of <hi>Deadly Nightshade</hi> maketh its chief <hi>Impression;</hi> and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
about four <hi>Minutes</hi> in some degree.</p>
                  <p>10. §. The <hi>Throat,</hi> or the <hi>Vvnla, Larinx</hi> and other adjacent <hi>Parts</hi>
are oftentimes the <hi>Seat</hi> of <hi>Taste.</hi> For there are many <hi>Bodies,</hi> which
although they have scarce any <hi>Taste</hi> upon the <hi>Tongue,</hi> or any other of
the aforesaid <hi>Parts,</hi> yet make a strong <hi>Impression</hi> on the <hi>Throat:</hi> as the
<hi>Leavs</hi> of little <hi>Daisy,</hi> little <hi>Celandine,</hi> and of <hi>Pimpinel;</hi> as also the
<hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Jalap, Mercury, Asparagus</hi> and others. Which being chewed
makelittle or no <hi>Impression</hi> on the <hi>Tongue,</hi> but their <hi>Juyce</hi> being swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:100350:168"/>
causeth a kind of pricking in the <hi>Throat;</hi> as when one is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
by a sharp <hi>Rheum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. §. And that this <hi>Taste</hi> or <hi>Sense,</hi> is truly distinct from either
the <hi>Heat, Pungency,</hi> or <hi>Acritude</hi> upon the <hi>Tongue,</hi> it is hence further
manifest; In that <hi>Pyrethrum,</hi> which is very <hi>Hot,</hi> and <hi>Cortex Winteranus</hi>
which is very <hi>Pungent</hi> upon the <hi>Tongue;</hi> yet their <hi>Juyce</hi> being swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
causeth no <hi>Heat, Pungency</hi> or <hi>Exasperation</hi> in the <hi>Throat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. §. <hi>Lastly,</hi> if we will take the word <hi>(Tast)</hi> in a larger sense,
the <hi>Oesophagus</hi> it self may be said to be sometimes the <hi>Subject</hi> thereof;
as of the <hi>Heat</hi> produced by the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Common Wormwood.</hi> For of
this <hi>Heat</hi> it is remarquable, that being first perceived on the <hi>Tip</hi> of the
<hi>Tongue,</hi> it thence maketh its <hi>transit</hi> to the <hi>Root</hi> of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> and so
into the <hi>Throat,</hi> and by degrees descends into the very <hi>Gulet;</hi> where
it seemeth to warm the <hi>Stomach;</hi> and so continues, in some degree,
almost ¼ of an hour. And the <hi>Transition</hi> and <hi>Descent</hi> of this <hi>Heat</hi> is
made, although none of the <hi>Juyce</hi> be swallowed. And in this maner
<hi>Tasts</hi> are distinguished with respect to their <hi>Subject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. §. So that the general <hi>Diversities</hi> of <hi>Tasts</hi> are these. With
respect to their <hi>Species,</hi> they are <hi>Simplices vel Compositi;</hi> To their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
Remissi vel Intensi;</hi> To their <hi>Duration, Breves vel Diuturni;</hi>
To the <hi>Terms</hi> of their <hi>Motion, Celeres vel Tardi;</hi> and lastly, To their
<hi>Subject, Fixi, Diffusivi &amp; Transitivi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. §. I HAVE thus endeavourd to draw up a <hi>Scheme</hi> or <hi>Inventory</hi>
of the several sorts of <hi>Tasts.</hi> In which, some may think, that I have
over done: and that as <hi>Galen</hi> hath been censured for being too curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in the <hi>Distinctions</hi> of <hi>Pulses;</hi> so have I been, in these of <hi>Tasts.</hi>
Not to enquire now, how far the <hi>Differences</hi> of the <hi>Pulse</hi> may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
or be fit to be taken notice of; I shall only say, That we have
not so much reason to censure him, if he hath given us some few which
are coincident; as we have to thank him, for observing so many which
are really distinct.</p>
                  <p>15. §. By the <hi>Scheme</hi> of <hi>Tasts</hi> here represented, we may be able,
so to enumerate the <hi>Modes</hi> of any <hi>Tast,</hi> as to make a <hi>Scientifick Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of it. Which is pleasant <hi>Instruction</hi> to any inquisitive mind; these
things being all matter of sense and demonstration; wherein lyeth,
though not always the most plausible, yet the most satisfying <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy;</hi>
and where men, after they are grown weary with turning round,
are oftentimes contented to rest.</p>
                  <p>16. §. But the usefulness of this <hi>Schem</hi> will further appear, in two
respects; <hi>sc.</hi> In conducting us to a cleerer and more particular <hi>Explication</hi>
of the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Tasts:</hi> and the <hi>Investigation</hi> of the <hi>Virtues</hi> of those
<hi>Bodies</hi> in which they reside. Whereof in the following <hi>Chapters.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. Of the CAUSES of Tasts.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O speak of the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Tasts,</hi> before we have
well enumerated and distinguished them; is to
provide <hi>Furniture</hi> for a <hi>House,</hi> before the <hi>Roomes</hi>
have been counted and measured out. But the
<hi>Varieties</hi> of <hi>Tasts</hi> having been first laid down;
it will induce us to believe, and investigate as
great a variety in their <hi>Causes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. §. Now the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Tasts,</hi> particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the <hi>Tasts</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> whereof we chiefly
speak, are, in general, these Four or Five, <hi>sc.</hi> The <hi>Bed</hi> out of which they
grow; The <hi>Aer</hi> in which they stand; The <hi>Parts</hi> of which they consist;
The several <hi>Fermentations</hi> under which their <hi>Juyces</hi> pass; And the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi>
by which their <hi>Tastable Parts</hi> are perceiv'd: as will appear upon
<hi>Instance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. §. But the immediate <hi>Causes,</hi> besides the <hi>Organs</hi> of <hi>Taste,</hi> are
the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi> As many of which, as come under the notice
of <hi>Sense,</hi> we have already supposed to be these Seven, <hi>Alkaline, Acid,
Aer, Water, Oyl, Spirit</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi> The <hi>Particles</hi> both of <hi>Alkaline</hi> and
<hi>Acid Salts,</hi> are all <hi>angular</hi> and <hi>poynted.</hi> Those of <hi>Aer,</hi> properly and
strictly so called, are <hi>Elastick</hi> or <hi>Springy;</hi> and therefore also <hi>Crooked;</hi> as
I have likewise formerly conjectured. And I find the Learned <hi>Borelli,</hi>
in a Book of his since then published, to be of the same Opinion. Those
of all <hi>Fluid Bodies, quà Fluid,</hi> and therefore of <hi>Water, Oyl</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi>
I conceive to be <hi>Globular,</hi> but <hi>hollow,</hi> and with holes in their Sides.
Those of <hi>Water,</hi> to be larger <hi>Globes,</hi> with more <hi>holes;</hi> those of <hi>Oyl,</hi> to
be lesser, with fewer <hi>holes;</hi> and those of <hi>Spirit</hi> the least. Lastly, that
the particles of <hi>Earth</hi> are also <hi>Round;</hi> yet angular; and nearer to a
<hi>solid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. §. These <hi>Principles</hi> affect the <hi>Organs</hi> of <hi>Sense,</hi> according to the
variety of their <hi>Figures,</hi> and of their <hi>Mixture.</hi> So those which are
sharp or poynted; and those which are <hi>springy;</hi> are fitted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any stronger <hi>Taste:</hi> and those which are round, are apt, of their
own <hi>Nature,</hi> to produce a <hi>weaker</hi> or <hi>softer</hi> one. And so by the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of their <hi>Mixture;</hi> not only with respect to their <hi>Proportion,</hi>
but also the very <hi>Mode</hi> of their <hi>Conjunction.</hi> Hence it is, that many
<hi>Bodies</hi> which abound with <hi>Salt,</hi> as <hi>Ambar</hi> with an <hi>Acid,</hi> and the <hi>Bones</hi>
of <hi>Land-Animals</hi> with an <hi>Alkaline,</hi> have notwithstanding but a weak
<hi>Tast;</hi> the <hi>Saline Parts</hi> being in the former drowned in the <hi>Oyl,</hi> and in
the latter also buried in the <hi>Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. §. The same is further confirmed by an <hi>Experiment</hi> mentioned
in a former <hi>Discourse;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of <hi>Mixt.</hi> Ch. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>sc.</hi> the <hi>Transmutation</hi> of <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Anise-Seeds,</hi>
with the help of <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> into a <hi>Rosin.</hi> For both those <hi>Liquors,</hi>
though so strongly tasted, apart; yet the <hi>Rosin</hi> made of them, being
well washed, hath a very mild <hi>Taste,</hi> and without any smatch of that
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:100350:169"/>
in either of the <hi>Liquors.</hi> Whence it follows, that the very <hi>Mode</hi> of
<hi>Mixture</hi> is sufficient, not only for the variation of the <hi>Degrees</hi> in any
one <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Tast;</hi> but also for the destroying of one <hi>Species,</hi> and the
introducing of another.</p>
                  <p>6. §. THESE things being premised, I conceive, That as an <hi>Unctuous
Tast</hi> dependeth upon <hi>Oyl;</hi> so a <hi>Vapid</hi> either on <hi>Water,</hi> or <hi>Earth:</hi> or
upon such an intimate <hi>Mixture</hi> of other <hi>Principles,</hi> as renders them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissoluble
by the <hi>Saliva,</hi> and so, in a manner, untastable.</p>
                  <p>7. §. That a <hi>Pungent,</hi> is made either by an <hi>Alkaly</hi> or an <hi>Acid</hi>
sharpned or whetted; that is, cleared from the soyl of other <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi>
as in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Sal Aromoniac</hi> or of <hi>Sulphur.</hi> And so in those
<hi>Plants</hi> which have a <hi>Pungent Tast;</hi> whose <hi>Juyces</hi> or <hi>Tinctures,</hi> although
they consist of divers <hi>Principles,</hi> yet all so loosely mixed, that being
dissolved by the <hi>Saliva,</hi> the <hi>Saline</hi> are hereupon left naked. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>biting Plants, quà biting,</hi> are <hi>Nitrous Plants.</hi> So that the <hi>Juyce</hi>
of such <hi>Plants,</hi> is a kind of <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre,</hi> made by the several <hi>Parts</hi>
of the <hi>Plant.</hi> Hence <hi>Arum</hi> grows best under an Hedg; where the
Ground, not being exposed to the <hi>Sun,</hi> but the <hi>Aer</hi> only, like those
<hi>Rooms</hi> in <hi>Houses,</hi> which are covered, is impregnated with a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of <hi>Nitrous Salt.</hi> And those <hi>Roots</hi> which are <hi>Biting,</hi> have but few
or but small <hi>Aer-Vessels;</hi> whereby fewer parts of the <hi>nitroaereal Sap</hi> are
carryed off into the <hi>Trunk.</hi> For the same <hi>Cause,</hi> it is no wonder,
that many <hi>Aquaticks</hi> are <hi>Biting; Water</hi> being, though it self cold, yet
the <hi>Menstruum</hi> by which all <hi>Salts</hi> are imbibed most easily, and in laxer
state of <hi>Commixture</hi> with other <hi>Principles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. §. <hi>Penetrant</hi> (something slower than <hi>Pungent)</hi> is made by any
<hi>Salt</hi> that is also soiled or guarded with <hi>Earth. Sower,</hi> by an <hi>Acid</hi> only
soyled with <hi>Earth. Salt,</hi> by an <hi>Acid</hi> guarded by an <hi>Alkaly,</hi> and soyled
with <hi>Earth. Cold,</hi> by an <hi>Acid</hi> drowned in <hi>Water,</hi> and soyled with
<hi>Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. §. In all these, the <hi>Salts</hi> are <hi>predominant;</hi> In <hi>Heat</hi> the <hi>Oyl</hi> or
<hi>Sulphur.</hi> The particles whereof being <hi>Spherick</hi> and <hi>bored</hi> with <hi>holes;</hi>
those of <hi>Salt</hi> stick in them, as the <hi>Spokes</hi> do in the <hi>Hub</hi> of a <hi>Wheel,</hi> or
as the <hi>Quills</hi> in the <hi>Skin</hi> of a <hi>Porcupine.</hi> Whereby, as in <hi>Common Fire</hi>
the <hi>Sparks</hi> of <hi>Sulphur</hi> being agitated and whirled about by the <hi>Aer;</hi>
with the help of the <hi>Salts,</hi> which stick in them, tear in pieces all kinds
of <hi>Bodies:</hi> so here, being agitated by the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> they
make a kind of hurry or combustion; and so, according to the degree
and strength of their <hi>Motion,</hi> tear in pieces fewer or more of the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
of the <hi>Tongue;</hi> and in a greater quantity, would raise a <hi>Blister</hi>
upon it; the common <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> or any strong <hi>Epispastick.</hi> So that
a <hi>Hot Tast,</hi> is produced by <hi>Sulphur</hi> toothed or armed with <hi>Salts.</hi>
Wherefore all <hi>Stillatitious Oyls</hi> are <hi>Hot;</hi> being strongly impregnated
or armed with the <hi>Essential Salts</hi> of the <hi>Plants</hi> from whence they are
distilled. And as those <hi>Plants</hi> which are very <hi>Parenchymous,</hi> from the
predominancy of their <hi>Volatile Acid,</hi> are <hi>biting:</hi> So those which are
<hi>Lignous,</hi> that is, have a good quantity of <hi>Lympheducts,</hi> from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miou
of their <hi>Sulphur</hi> are commonly <hi>Hot.</hi> For the same reason
it is, that many both <hi>Biting</hi> and <hi>Hot Plants,</hi> as the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Dragon,
Garden-Radish, Onion, Iris, Rape-Crowfoot,</hi> &amp;c. being corked up in a
bottle with <hi>Water,</hi> and set in a Cellar or other cool place; they do all
of them turn <hi>Sower</hi> in a few days: The same <hi>Fermentation,</hi> at once
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:100350:170"/>
sullying the <hi>Salts</hi> of the one, and disarming the <hi>Sulphurs</hi> of the other.
But some, wherein the <hi>Sulphureous</hi> parts are more copious, will hardly
ever become <hi>Sower.</hi> Hence also, some <hi>Plants,</hi> whose <hi>Roots</hi> are neither
<hi>Hot,</hi> nor of any strong <hi>Taste,</hi> as those of <hi>Wild Anemone;</hi> yet their
<hi>Leaves</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> are plainly <hi>Caustick:</hi> So that it seems, that as their
<hi>Juyces</hi> rise up into the <hi>Trunk</hi> or <hi>Stalk,</hi> and therein further fermented,
the <hi>Sulphureus Parts</hi> thereof, are at the same time relaxed from the
other <hi>Principles,</hi> and acuated with an <hi>Aereal Salt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. §. A <hi>Stupifacient Tast</hi> (as the <hi>Impression</hi> which some <hi>Hot Plants</hi>
make upon the <hi>Tongue</hi> may be called) is in some sort, analogous to the
mortifying of any part of the Body by the application of a <hi>Caustick.</hi>
For as there the mortification succeeds the burning pain, so here, the
<hi>Stupifaction,</hi> neither comes before, nor with the <hi>Heat,</hi> but follows it.</p>
                  <p>11. §. <hi>Sweetness</hi> is produced, sometimes by an <hi>Alkaly;</hi> smoothed
either by a <hi>Sulphur,</hi> as in <hi>Lime-Water;</hi> or by both a <hi>Spirit</hi> and a <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi>
as in the <hi>Stillatitious Oyls</hi> of <hi>Animals.</hi> But most commonly, by
a smoothed <hi>Acid;</hi> as in <hi>Malt, Sugar, Hony.</hi> Hence a <hi>Sweet Taste,</hi> is
generally founded in a Sower; So Sower <hi>Apples,</hi> by mellowing, and
harsh <hi>Pears,</hi> by baking become sweet; the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> being
hereby at once separated from the other <hi>Principles</hi> and brought to a
nearer union with the <hi>Acid.</hi> So the Sower <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Wood-Sorrel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dry'd, become sweet: and those of a sower <hi>Codlin,</hi> while they
hang on the <hi>Tree,</hi> and even of a <hi>Crab-Tree,</hi> are neither <hi>Astringent,</hi> nor
sower, but sensibly sweet. And so commonly, wherever the said <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
are a little exalted by a soft <hi>Fermentation;</hi> as in the <hi>Juyce</hi> of the
<hi>Stalk</hi> of <hi>Maze</hi> or <hi>Indian Wheat,</hi> which is a sweet as <hi>Sugar;</hi> and in the
<hi>green Stalks</hi> of all sorts of <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Grass,</hi> in several degrees. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Tulips</hi> and some other <hi>Roots,</hi> being taken up, in open weather,
sometime before they <hi>sprout;</hi> if tasted, are as sweet as <hi>Liquirish</hi> or <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar;</hi>
and at no other time: not only <hi>Fruits,</hi> but many <hi>Roots, Seeds,</hi>
and other <hi>Parts,</hi> upon their first or early <hi>Germination,</hi> acquiring a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Mellowness,</hi> wherein, all their <hi>Principles</hi> are resolved, and their
most <hi>Spirituous Parts</hi> exalted and spread over the <hi>Acid.</hi> Wherefore
also most <hi>Roots,</hi> which are not meerly long, but grow deep in the
ground, have at least some of their <hi>Juyces</hi> of a sweet <hi>Tast;</hi> as <hi>Liquirish,
Eryngo, Hounds-Tongue, Garden-Parsnep, Black Henbeane, Deadly Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shade,
&amp;c.</hi> Even the <hi>Juyce</hi> of <hi>Horse Radish,</hi> which bleeds at the <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheducts,</hi>
is of a sweet <hi>Taste.</hi> And of the same kindred those which
grow the deepest, are the sweetest; as a <hi>Parsnep</hi> is sweeter than a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>root,</hi>
especially if you tast the bleeding <hi>Sap;</hi> and the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Common
Tall Trefoyl</hi> tasteth somewhat like <hi>Liquirish,</hi> but is not near so sweet.
For all deep <hi>Roots,</hi> are fed with a less <hi>Nitrous Aliment:</hi> and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter
from the <hi>Aer,</hi> their <hi>Juyces</hi> pass under much more soft and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<hi>Fermentations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. §. <hi>Bitterness</hi> is produced by a <hi>Sulphur</hi> well impregnated, either
with an <hi>Alkaline,</hi> or an <hi>Acid Salt,</hi> but also shackled with <hi>Earth.</hi> And
therefore the <hi>Bitterest Plants,</hi> commonly yield the greatest quantity of
<hi>Lixivial Salt.</hi> So also many <hi>Stillatitious Oyls</hi> digested with any strong
<hi>Acid,</hi> will acquire a <hi>Bitter Taste.</hi> Wherefore this <hi>Taste</hi> is often founded
either in a <hi>Hot Taste,</hi> or a <hi>Sweet.</hi> Hence it is, that the <hi>Leaves</hi> of all
sweet <hi>Roots</hi> are <hi>Bitter.</hi> And that the <hi>Fig-Tree,</hi> which bears a sweet
<hi>Fruit,</hi> bleeds a <hi>Bitter Milk.</hi> So likewise those <hi>Plants,</hi> which bear a
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:100350:170"/>
                     <hi>Bitter Stalk,</hi> have not <hi>Bitter,</hi> but <hi>Hot Roots,</hi> as in <hi>Yarrow, Primrose,
Wormwood, Rue, Carduus benedictus</hi> &amp;c. is manifest. So the <hi>Coats</hi> of
the <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Viola Lunaria</hi> are of a <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>biting Tast;</hi> but the <hi>Seeds</hi>
themselves, in which the <hi>Salts,</hi> though copious, yet are also immersed
in a greater quantity of <hi>Oyl,</hi> are <hi>Bitter.</hi> And that the <hi>Earthy Parts</hi> do
also contribute something more to this, than to most of the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Tasts,</hi> is argued from its being more <hi>Fixed;</hi> that is, the <hi>Body</hi> in which
it resides, is either more <hi>Fixed,</hi> or else flyeth not away in that same
state of conjunction, by which it maketh a <hi>Bitter Taste.</hi> For whereas
<hi>Hot, Biting,</hi> and divers other <hi>Plants</hi> lose the strength of their <hi>Taste,</hi>
by drying; most of those which are <hi>Bitter,</hi> do hereby increase it. And
although the <hi>Extract</hi> of <hi>Dandelion</hi> and some other <hi>Roots,</hi> which are
very <hi>Bitter,</hi> hath scarce any <hi>Tast;</hi> yet generally, they are <hi>Bitter Plants,</hi>
which are best for the making of <hi>Extracts.</hi> And the distilled waters
of <hi>Plants</hi> which are <hi>Hot</hi> and <hi>Bitter,</hi> notwithstanding that they always
tast high of the <hi>Heat,</hi> yet rarely and very faintly of the <hi>Bitter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. §. <hi>Astringency,</hi> is made, partly, by the further increase and
more intimate union of the <hi>Earth.</hi> And therefore this is seated still in
a more <hi>Fixed Composition,</hi> than a <hi>Bitter.</hi> And partly, by the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Sulphur.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Acid Parts</hi> ingredient to it,
either by <hi>Fermentation</hi> or otherwise, are easily exposed. <hi>Astringency</hi>
being the <hi>Womb</hi> or <hi>Bud</hi> of a <hi>Sower.</hi> For all or most <hi>Astringent Roots</hi>
bear a sower <hi>Leaf,</hi> or a sower <hi>Fruit;</hi> as those of all <hi>Docks</hi> and <hi>Sorrels,
Black-Thorn, Dog-Rose,</hi> and others. Wherefore also, <hi>Astringency</hi> is
often found in conjuction with <hi>Bitter, Sweet,</hi> or <hi>Sower;</hi> but scarce
ever with <hi>Pungent,</hi> or <hi>Hot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. §. An <hi>Aromatick Tast,</hi> seems to be produced, chiefly, by a
<hi>spirituous, acid,</hi> and <hi>volatile Sulphur;</hi> as in <hi>Ambar-griese, Cardamon-Seeds,</hi>
many <hi>Stillatitious Oyls</hi> &amp;c. A <hi>Nauseous,</hi> by a <hi>Sulphur</hi> less <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuos</hi>
and <hi>Volatile,</hi> and more <hi>Alkaline;</hi> as in the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Dog-stones, Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scabious,</hi>
the young and green <hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Coriander,</hi> or the <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi>
The <hi>Spirit,</hi> as it enters the <hi>Nerves,</hi> carrying the <hi>Alkaline Sulphur</hi>
along with it; as when a City is betrayed by one of its Inhabitants to
an Enemy.</p>
                  <p>25. §. An <hi>Intermittent Taste,</hi> as in <hi>Arum,</hi> seems to have its depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon a simple and very pure <hi>Nitre,</hi> which by its subtilty enters
into the very <hi>Concaves</hi> of the <hi>Nervous Fibers</hi> of the <hi>Tongue:</hi> and so
being lodged there, is little affected or stirred, by the <hi>Motion</hi> of the
<hi>Blood;</hi> but only when the <hi>Tongue</hi> it self is moved, at which time it
causeth a kind of pricking <hi>Taste.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>16. §. A <hi>Tremulous Taste,</hi> as in <hi>Pyrethrum,</hi> dependeth probably,
upon an <hi>Aereal Sulphur;</hi> which being agitated by the <hi>Blood</hi> in its <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,</hi>
the <hi>springy Motion</hi> or <hi>Vibration</hi> of the <hi>Aereal Parts</hi> produce
that <hi>Taste.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. §. A <hi>Tast</hi> is <hi>Lingual, Guttural,</hi> &amp;c. according to the grosness
or sineness or other difference of the <hi>Membranes</hi> into which the <hi>tastable
parts</hi> are admitted. For <hi>Tasts</hi> are made not meerly by the outward
<hi>Contact,</hi> but the <hi>Ingress</hi> of the <hi>tastable parts.</hi> Now the outer <hi>Skin</hi> of
the <hi>Tongue,</hi> which is commonly observed to pill off in boyling, like the
<hi>Cuticula</hi> in other <hi>Parts,</hi> hath either no sense, or much less than that which
lies under it; and is therefore, but a <hi>Seive</hi> or <hi>Strainer</hi> to the <hi>tastable
parts.</hi> So that being of different sineness in the several parts of the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:100350:171"/>
                     <hi>Tongue;</hi> it hereby comes to pass, that according as the <hi>tastable parts</hi> of
any <hi>Plant</hi> are more or less penetrant, subtle, or dissoluble, they are
admitted into one part of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> and not another. And in the
<hi>Throat,</hi> the outer <hi>Skin</hi> it self, seems to be the immediate <hi>Sensory;</hi> and
so, to be evidently affected with the <hi>Juyces</hi> of some <hi>Plants,</hi> from which
the <hi>Tongue</hi> receiveth little or no sensible <hi>Impression.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. §. When the <hi>Tast</hi> is <hi>Permanent</hi> and <hi>Fixed</hi> in some one <hi>Part;</hi>
it is a sign, either that the <hi>Gustable Parts</hi> are less dissoluble; or more
subtle, so as to enter the <hi>Concaves</hi> of the <hi>Fibers;</hi> and that there is an
admixture of an <hi>Aereal Salt,</hi> or a like <hi>Sulphur;</hi> some of the parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
being crooked, hang like <hi>Hooks</hi> on the <hi>Fibers</hi> of the <hi>Tongue.</hi> For
the reception of such a <hi>Tast,</hi> is not to be looked upon as a wound
made with a <hi>Lancet,</hi> and so the <hi>Lancet</hi> taken away; but with the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet</hi>
sticking in the wound; until in time, 'tis carryed off by the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation</hi>
of the <hi>Blood;</hi> which like the <hi>Stream</hi> of a <hi>River</hi> in a <hi>Flood,</hi>
carries all before it, but those things last, which stick in the <hi>Mud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>19. §. But when the <hi>Tast,</hi> though <hi>Permanent,</hi> yet is <hi>Dissusive</hi> or
<hi>Transitive;</hi> it seems probable, that as there is a less admixture of <hi>Aer;</hi>
so a greater subtlety of the <hi>Tastable Parts,</hi> whereby they are conveyed,
through the <hi>Nervous Fibers,</hi> from one <hi>Part</hi> to another.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. Of the Judgment which may be made of the VIRTUES
of Plants, from their Tasts.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S by duly observing the <hi>Tasts</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> we may be
directed to understand their <hi>Causes.</hi> So also the
<hi>Use</hi> and <hi>Virtues</hi> of those <hi>Plants</hi> or <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi>
in which they reside. For the proof whereof, an
<hi>Instance</hi> might be fetched from very particular
difference of <hi>Tast</hi> before set down. But it may be
enough, to give these which follow.</p>
                  <p>2. §. And first, we may make no ill guess <hi>ex
Analogia,</hi> or where we find the same <hi>Tast,</hi> that there the same <hi>Virtue</hi>
in some kind, and in some degree, may reside. So <hi>Jalap, Mercury,</hi>
and <hi>Daisy,</hi> have all of them that exasperating <hi>Tast</hi> in the <hi>Throat</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
described; and they are all three more or less <hi>Cathartick.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we may believe, that other <hi>Plants</hi> which make the like <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi>
on the <hi>Throat,</hi> and there are many others which do, that
they are in some degree alike <hi>Cathartick.</hi> Those <hi>Plants</hi> which
are reckoned amongst the chiefest <hi>Cephalicks,</hi> cause rather a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
than a vehement <hi>Heat</hi> upon the <hi>Tongue,</hi> as <hi>Pyrethrum, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorbium,
Black-Heliebore,</hi> &amp;c. It seemeth therefore reasonable to
rank with these, any other <hi>Plant,</hi> though not used, which produceth
the like durable <hi>Heat.</hi> The young <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Yarrow,</hi> or <hi>Millefolium,</hi>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:100350:171"/>
have the same <hi>Taste,</hi> as the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Contrayerva:</hi> and may therefore be
used for the same purpose, with a probability of the like success; if
not a better, because they may be gotten fresher. But by drying the
<hi>Root,</hi> the <hi>Tast</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> which lie in its exhalible parts, are much
lost. The <hi>Seeds</hi> of the lesser <hi>Cardamom,</hi> and of <hi>Zedoary Root,</hi> if sound,
have both a smatch of the <hi>Tast</hi> of <hi>Camphire.</hi> They may therefore all,
so far, reach the same Case.</p>
                  <p>3. §. Again, as we may make no ill conjecture from the sameness of
<hi>Taste</hi> in <hi>Plants</hi> of several <hi>Tribes;</hi> so from the diversity of <hi>Taste,</hi> in those
of the same. So the <hi>Flowers</hi> of all the <hi>Docks</hi> are evidently <hi>Astringent,</hi>
and not <hi>Sower;</hi> except those of the <hi>Rha-pontick,</hi> which are extream
sower, even in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> degree. Which is no mean <hi>Signature</hi> of some
more than ordinary <hi>Virtue</hi> in it, besides what it hath in common with
the rest of the <hi>Tribe.</hi> The <hi>Flowers</hi> of <hi>Pancy</hi> have a kind of fulsome
<hi>Tast,</hi> plainly different from that of <hi>Violets:</hi> and in some <hi>Hypochondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acal
Cases</hi> may be more useful.</p>
                  <p>4. §. It likewise importeth much, to observe the difference of <hi>Taste</hi>
in the several <hi>Parts</hi> of the same <hi>Plant.</hi> So the <hi>Barque</hi> of <hi>Sassafras</hi> is three
times as strong, as the <hi>Wood:</hi> and the like may be observed in any
other commonly known <hi>Tree.</hi> If therefore we could obtein the <hi>Barques</hi>
of <hi>Santalum, Lignum Rhodium, Lignum Aloes,</hi> &amp;c. they would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
most of them, be of much greater use. And as the <hi>Taste</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
stronger; so, much more grateful, in one <hi>Part</hi> than in another:
as in the <hi>Flowers</hi> or <hi>Yellow Attire</hi> in the <hi>Heads</hi> of <hi>Carduus Benedictus;</hi>
which being infused in <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> or other convenient <hi>Liquor,</hi>
make a pleasant <hi>Cordial.</hi> Nature having laped up the <hi>Virtue</hi> in the
<hi>Leavs,</hi> as in a brown <hi>Paper;</hi> but in the <hi>Flowers,</hi> as in <hi>Leaf-Gold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. §. As also, how far the <hi>Taste</hi> of any <hi>Plant</hi> may alter, either in
preserving, or preparing it. So the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Arum,</hi> when taken fresh
out of the ground, is notably <hi>Pungent:</hi> but being throughly dryed,
and especially kept for some time, hath no more <hi>Taste,</hi> and therefore
in all likelyhood, no more <hi>Virtue,</hi> than a <hi>Lump</hi> of <hi>Starch.</hi> The like
we are to judge of all other <hi>Plants,</hi> whose <hi>Virtue</hi> lieth in their exhali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Parts.</hi> The <hi>Stillatitious Oyls</hi> of many <hi>Plants,</hi> are stronger than the
<hi>Leavs</hi> or other <hi>Parts</hi> from whence they are drawn: but some there
are, which are weaker; as is that of <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> in which the <hi>Heat</hi> is
neither pertinaceous, as in the <hi>Gum</hi> it self, nor so great.</p>
                  <p>6. §. We may make, moreover, a jugdment from the <hi>Nature</hi> of
the <hi>Tast.</hi> So those <hi>Roots</hi> which are <hi>Bitter,</hi> and not <hi>Hot,</hi> as of <hi>Cichory,</hi>
and the rest of the <hi>Intybous</hi> kind, may be accounted <hi>Nitro-Sulphureous;</hi>
and so, to be <hi>Abstersive</hi> without any <hi>Heating Quality.</hi> The <hi>Marum
Austriacum,</hi> which is extream <hi>Pungent,</hi> as well as <hi>Aromatick,</hi> may be
looked upon as the best <hi>Cephalick</hi> of that <hi>Tribe.</hi> Because we find,
that <hi>Jalap</hi> hath a special property of imitating the <hi>Glandulous Parts</hi>
of the <hi>Mouth,</hi> and <hi>Throat;</hi> we may gather, That it is a better
<hi>Purge</hi> to all the other <hi>Glandulous Parts,</hi> than most other <hi>Catharticks.</hi>
Which is also one reason of its operation, for the most part, with at
least a tendency to vomit; the <hi>Stomach</hi> it self being <hi>Glandulous</hi> as well
as the <hi>Throat,</hi> and thereby answerably a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ected with it. A strong <hi>Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
of <hi>white Sarzaparilla</hi> in <hi>Water,</hi> botled up, and kept in a <hi>Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ar</hi> for
the space of two months, becomes extream sower; far beyond any
thing observed in the <hi>Tasts</hi> of the <hi>Juyces</hi> and <hi>Infusions</hi> of divers other
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:100350:172"/>
                     <hi>Plants</hi> kept as long and in the same manner. Which shews, how well
Nature hath adapted a <hi>Plant</hi> of so mild a <hi>Taste,</hi> either by similitude of
parts, for the carrying off of any <hi>preternatural Acid;</hi> or by contrariety,
for the curbing of an exorbitant <hi>Salt.</hi> The <hi>Barque</hi> of the <hi>Root</hi> of
common <hi>Wormwood,</hi> which impresseth a pertinaceous and diffusive <hi>Taste,</hi>
which descendeth from the <hi>Tongue</hi> into the <hi>Gulet,</hi> as is before descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed;
may be justly ranked with the most excellent <hi>Stomachicks;</hi> and
upon tryal, I find it one of the best: besides, that it is neither unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
nor affecteth the <hi>Head,</hi> as the <hi>Leavs.</hi> Yet the <hi>Gardener,</hi> and
every Body throws it away, as good for nothing.</p>
                  <p>7. §. I shall conclude with one note, which is this; That the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
Virtue</hi> of <hi>Medicines,</hi> which some <hi>Physicians</hi> positively deny, and
most dispute; from some of the forementioned <hi>Differences</hi> of <hi>Taste,</hi> as
well as for other reasons, may seem, at least, to be probable. For
why should not a <hi>Medicine</hi> make an <hi>Impression</hi> upon one <hi>Part,</hi> and not
upon another, within the <hi>Body,</hi> as well as we find it doth within the
<hi>Mouth?</hi> especially, since the <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Mouth,</hi> are of a less different
<hi>Nature,</hi> than some of the <hi>Viscera.</hi>

the <hi>Diversities</hi> and <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Tasts</hi> in <hi>Plants,</hi> may
easily be transferr'd to those of their <hi>Odours.</hi> I
shall now therefore only remarque some particulars,
not commonly taken notice of hitherto, and leave
them as a <hi>Specimen</hi> to be Improved by other Hands.</p>
                     <p>§. 2. The <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Rape-Crowfoot</hi> being cut, and held to the <hi>Nose,</hi>
when it is newly taken out of the <hi>Ground,</hi> smelleth almost like
<hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> of fresh <hi>Scurvygrass Juyce.</hi> And hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of making the <hi>Eyes</hi> to water, as <hi>Onions</hi> do. <hi>Horse-Radish Root</hi>
is not so <hi>Pungent</hi> to the <hi>Nose,</hi> but gets pretty much into the <hi>Eyes.</hi> But
that of <hi>Dragon,</hi> doth neither affect the <hi>Eyes,</hi> nor the <hi>Nose.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. §. The <hi>Succulent Roots</hi> of <hi>Dogstones,</hi> and most of that <hi>Tribe,</hi>
have a ranck <hi>Smell.</hi> And that of <hi>Crown Imperial,</hi> being rub'd a little,
smells as like a <hi>Fox,</hi> as one <hi>Fox</hi> smelleth like another.</p>
                     <p>4. §. The <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Patience</hi> digested with <hi>Water,</hi> in a warm <hi>Room,</hi>
for the space of three weeks, smels like <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Harts Horn,</hi> or other
<hi>Urinous Spirit.</hi> Of <hi>Red Dock,</hi> almost like <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.</hi>
That of <hi>Dragon</hi> bottled up with <hi>Water,</hi> and set in a <hi>Cellar,</hi> about a
Month, stinks like the <hi>pus</hi> of the most <hi>Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Months, more abominably, than either to be endured or expressed.</p>
                     <p>5. §. The <hi>Leavs</hi> of <hi>Mountain Calamint,</hi> smell like <hi>Peny Royal.</hi>
Those of <hi>Ulmaria,</hi> like <hi>Walnut Pills.</hi> Of <hi>Yellow Lamium,</hi> like a <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same.</hi>
Of <hi>Sena,</hi> a good quantity being held to the <hi>Nose,</hi> of a rank
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:100350:172"/>
                        <hi>Smell</hi> betwixt that of <hi>Sweat</hi> and <hi>Urine.</hi> Of <hi>Coriander,</hi> when green and
young, stink so basely, that they can hardly be endur'd. Sometimes
the <hi>Leavs</hi> have a stronger <hi>Smell,</hi> than the <hi>Flower,</hi> as in <hi>Borage,</hi> and
sometimes the <hi>Stalk,</hi> a stronger than the <hi>Leavs,</hi> as in <hi>Ulmaria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. §. <hi>Rue Leavs</hi> corked up in a bottle and set in a <hi>Cellar</hi> for about
ten weeks, smell like <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Harts Horn,</hi> or of <hi>Urine.</hi> The green
<hi>Leaves</hi> of <hi>Roses</hi> infused in water, have a mild, but pleasant <hi>Smell.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is that of <hi>Savine</hi> unpleasant, upon the like <hi>Infusion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. §. <hi>Scurvygrass Juyce</hi> kept about ¾ of a year in bottles, with the
green <hi>Sedement,</hi> in a warm <hi>Room,</hi> stinks like Humane <hi>Excrements.</hi> And
<hi>Scurvygrass Wine,</hi> made only of the <hi>Juyce,</hi> smells like some <hi>Issues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. §. The <hi>Flowers</hi> of <hi>Yarrow,</hi> smell not much unlike to those of
<hi>Southernwood.</hi> And the <hi>Flowers</hi> of <hi>Crowfoot</hi> almost like those of <hi>Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vygrass.</hi>
Some <hi>Flowers</hi> are of a weaker <hi>Smell</hi> in the <hi>Bud,</hi> as those of
<hi>Mallow.</hi> But many have a stronger, than when they are blown open;
as those of <hi>Lavender, Rosemary,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>9. §. The <hi>Buds</hi> of <hi>Vervaine Mallow,</hi> while they are young, and
the <hi>Flowers</hi> unseen, have a very pleasant <hi>Smell,</hi> like that of <hi>Geranium
Moschatum:</hi> but when afterwards they are opened they have an unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
<hi>Smell.</hi> Common <hi>Mallow Flowers</hi> dryed and bottled up for some
time, acquire, though not a strong, yet very noysom <hi>Smell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. §. The <hi>Purple Pouch</hi> of <hi>Dragon</hi> which covers the <hi>Seed,</hi> being
broken, smells just like a <hi>Lobster.</hi> But permitted to lie in a warm <hi>Room</hi>
for some days, smells exactly like <hi>Carrion;</hi> and scents the <hi>Room</hi> with
the same <hi>Smell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. §. Some <hi>Seeds</hi> as those of <hi>Cumine, Daucus,</hi> being powdered
and laped up only in <hi>Papers,</hi> do notwithstanding retein their <hi>Smell.</hi>
But many others, as of <hi>Sweet Fenil,</hi> in a short time, lose it. Some
<hi>Seeds,</hi> when they first begin to sprout, become <hi>Odorous,</hi> which were
not so before; as the <hi>Garden Bean.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. I. In which is shewed, the Compleat or Utmost Impregnation
of WATER with several kinds of Salt, both together,
and apart.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N discourse upon a <hi>Lecture</hi> formerly read, concerning
the <hi>Lixivial Salts</hi> of <hi>Plants;</hi> It was mentioned, as a
thing asserted by some <hi>Phylosophers,</hi> That <hi>Water</hi>
having been fully impregnated with one kind of
<hi>Salt,</hi> so as to bear no more of that kind; it would
yet bear, or dissolve some portion of another; and
so of a third. And it was referred to Me by this
Honourable Chair, to examine and produce the <hi>Experiment.</hi> The doing
whereof brought into my mind divers other <hi>Experiments</hi> hereunto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating.</p>
                  <p>2. §. As next, With what difference of quantity this <hi>Superim-praegnation</hi>
would be made, upon the <hi>Solution</hi> of different <hi>Salts?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. §. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether the <hi>Solution</hi> of a smaller quantity of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Salts,</hi> doth consist with the <hi>non-increase</hi> of the bulk of the <hi>Water?</hi>
Because this also is affirmed by some.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:100350:174"/>
4. §. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What quantity of the several kinds of <hi>Salt,</hi> may
be dissolved severally, in the same quantity of <hi>Water?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. §. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Whether by dissolving a <hi>Salt</hi> in <hi>Water,</hi> there be any
<hi>Space</hi> gained, or not? That is, whether the <hi>Bulk</hi> of the <hi>Water</hi> be
greater, before the <hi>Salt</hi> lying in it be fully dissolved, than it is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?
Or if a <hi>Cubick Inch</hi> of <hi>Salt</hi> be dissolved in nine <hi>Cubick Inches</hi>
of <hi>Water;</hi> Whether the <hi>Water</hi> will then fill a <hi>Vessel</hi> of ten <hi>Cubick Inches
content?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. §. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Whether the <hi>Space</hi> be equally gained, by an equal
encrease of the same <hi>Salt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. §. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Whether upon the <hi>Solution</hi> of several kinds of
<hi>Salts,</hi> be gained so many several quantities of <hi>Space?</hi> That is, if the
<hi>Solution</hi> of common <hi>Salt</hi> gains, suppose, an <hi>Inch,</hi> whether the <hi>Solution</hi> of
<hi>Salt Armoniack</hi> gains as much, or more, or less? and so for other <hi>Salts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. §. <hi>Eighthly,</hi> What that just space may be, which any <hi>Salt</hi> gaineth
with respect to its own <hi>Bulk,</hi> or that of the <hi>Water?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. §. And first, for the <hi>Superimpregnation</hi> of <hi>Water;</hi> I put into
a bottle ℥ij of fair <hi>Water;</hi> adding thereto, first half an Ounce of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre;</hi>
and afterwards more, as the <hi>Water</hi> would dissolve it; and (that
I might be sure the <hi>Impregnation</hi> was full) some portion above what
the <hi>Water</hi> would bear. Then having separated this remaining portion;
I put to this <hi>Solution</hi> of <hi>Nitre,</hi> two Drachms of <hi>Sal Armoniac;</hi> which
wholly and easily dissolved in the said <hi>Solution;</hi> though it would not
bear a grain more of <hi>Nitre.</hi> I then added a third Drachm of <hi>Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac,</hi>
after that a fourth, and a fifth; all which, within the space
of half an hour, were perfectly dissolved in the said <hi>Solution,</hi> without
any precipitation of the <hi>Nitre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. §. In the making of this Experiment, two things, to render it
infallacious, are to be noted. That the said <hi>Salts</hi> were not dissolved
by the help of <hi>Fire,</hi> but only by a strong and continued <hi>Agitation.</hi>
And that this was done upon a warm day: which I mention, because
that even the changes of the weather will somewhat alter the <hi>Solubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of the <hi>Salts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. §. Having made the Experiment upon two <hi>Salts,</hi> I proceeded to
repeat it upon three. And first I dissolved as much common <hi>Salt</hi> in
℥ij of <hi>Water,</hi> as that quantity would bear. Then having separated
the subsiding portion; I put to the <hi>Solution,</hi> no less than five Drachms
of <hi>Nitre,</hi> which by a continued <hi>Agitation,</hi> was wholly dissolved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
neither the <hi>Nitre</hi> nor the common <hi>Salt</hi> being in the least precipitated.
Then adding a Scruple more, it would not dissolve, but subsided. This
second su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iding portion, I again separated; and then put to this <hi>Super-impregnation,</hi>
near <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> which was also dissolved as the
former. And if as many more <hi>Salts</hi> had been added, tis probable that
the same <hi>Water</hi> would have born some quantity of them all.</p>
                  <p>12. §. From this Experiment, it is a Conclusion demonstrated,
That not only the visible <hi>Crystals,</hi> but the very <hi>Atomes</hi> of every <hi>Salt,</hi>
at least those <hi>Particles</hi> which are ultimately dissolved in <hi>Water,</hi> have a
different <hi>Figure</hi> one from another. Because that if they were all of
one <hi>Figure;</hi> there would be no <hi>Superimpregnation,</hi> but the <hi>Pores</hi> of
the same <hi>Water,</hi> would imbibe as much of one <hi>Salt,</hi> as answers to the
total of two more <hi>Salts</hi> imbibed: that is to say, it would as well
imbibe two Ounces of common <hi>Salt,</hi> as one Ounce of common <hi>Salt</hi> and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:100350:175"/>
another of <hi>Nitre:</hi> which yet is contrary to the Experiment. And it
is the same thing, whether we suppose the <hi>Pores</hi> of <hi>Water</hi> to be also
different, or not. Because, that if the <hi>Figure</hi> of all the said <hi>Atomes</hi> be
the same; then their respect to the <hi>Pores</hi> of the <hi>Water</hi> must be the
same, how different so ever those <hi>Pores</hi> be: which is also contrary to
the Experiment. Besides it is a great presumption, to say, that the
<hi>Pores,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Atomes</hi> of <hi>Water</hi> have different <hi>Figures;</hi> and
yet not those of <hi>Salts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. §. From the same Experiment we may go upon good ground in
<hi>Compounded Infusions;</hi> whether of <hi>Purgative,</hi> or other <hi>Materials.</hi> As
not doubting, but that the same <hi>Menstruum</hi> may be highly impregnated
with several <hi>Ingredients</hi> at once, whose operative parts may be therein
copiously dissolved, without hindring either an <hi>Extraction,</hi> or causing
a <hi>Precipitation</hi> one of an other.</p>
                  <p>14. §. The <hi>Second</hi> Enquiry is, With what difference this <hi>Superim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnation</hi>
of <hi>Water</hi> is made? which I find considerable. For a <hi>Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of above five Drachms of <hi>Nitre</hi> may be <hi>superimpregnated</hi> with no
less quantity of <hi>Sal Armoniac.</hi> And a <hi>Solution</hi> of five Drachms of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Salt,</hi> may be <hi>superimpregnated</hi> with as much <hi>Nitre.</hi> Yet neither
a strong <hi>Solution</hi> (as of five Drachms) of common <hi>Salt,</hi> will bear above
two Scruples of <hi>Sal Armoniac:</hi> nor will a strong <hi>Solution</hi> (as of five
Drachms) of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> bear above a Drachm of common <hi>Salt:</hi> for
if above the said quantities of either of them be mixed together: they
are both copiously and forthwith precipitated to the bottome of the
<hi>Glass.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. §. Whence, notwithstanding the former Experiment, yet are
we admonished, not to infuse all manner of <hi>Ingredients</hi> in any propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Because though some do not, yet others will precipitate one
another.</p>
                  <p>16. §. The <hi>Third</hi> Enquiry was this, Whether the <hi>Solution</hi> of a
smaller quantity of several <hi>Salts,</hi> doth consist with the <hi>non-increase</hi> of
the <hi>Bulk</hi> of the <hi>Water?</hi> For this I took a <hi>Bolthead</hi> with a slender <hi>Neck,</hi>
conteining about a pint and a quarter of <hi>Water;</hi> and dissolved therein
about ℥jss of <hi>Nitre.</hi> And marking the place to which the <hi>Water</hi>
ascended in the <hi>Neck</hi> of the <hi>Bolthead:</hi> I then dissolved in the same <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
about a Drachm of <hi>Sal Gemmae:</hi> which little quantity raised the
<hi>Water</hi> above half an Inch higher then it was before. The like I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served

                     </hi> to a <hi>Solution</hi> of <hi>Sal Armoniac.</hi> So that
to suppose the variation of the <hi>Salt</hi> doth prevent the increase of the <hi>Bulk</hi>
of the <hi>Water,</hi> is a manifest Error.</p>
                  <p>17. §. From the same Experiment it also appears, That the ascent
of the <hi>Water</hi> upon a <hi>Superimpregnation,</hi> is the same, by whatsoever <hi>Salt</hi>
the first <hi>Impregnation</hi> be made. For instance, Let a <hi>Solution</hi> of <hi>Nitre</hi>
ascend in the <hi>Neck</hi> of the <hi>Bolthead,</hi> suppose, to 10 Inches, then add
½ an Ounce more of <hi>Nitre,</hi> so as to raise the <hi>Water,</hi> suppose, 12 Inches
or more, or less, according to the <hi>Bore</hi> of the <hi>Neck.</hi> In like manner,
let a <hi>Solution</hi> of <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> reach to ten Inches: then add again half
an Ounce of <hi>Nitre;</hi> and it will reach just 12 Inches, or more or less,
as before.</p>
                  <p>18. §. The <hi>Fourth</hi> Enquiry is, What quantity of the several kinds
of <hi>Salt,</hi> may be dissolved severally in the same quantity of <hi>Water:</hi>
that is to say, by agitation alone, without the help of fire, as I noted
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:100350:175"/>
before. And upon tryal it appears, First, that two Ounces of <hi>Water</hi>
will dissolve three Ounces of <hi>Loaf-Sugar</hi> and no more, except the
<hi>Water</hi> be heated.</p>
                  <p>19. §. The same quantity of <hi>Water</hi> that is, two Ounces will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
above two Ounces of <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar.</hi> I say above, for how much
more, want of a greater quantity of <hi>Salt</hi> which I could confide in,
made me that I could not finish the Experiment.</p>
                  <p>20. §. The same quantity, <hi>sc.</hi> two Ounces of <hi>Water,</hi> dissolveth an
Ounce and a Drachm of <hi>Green Vitriol.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. §. The like quantity dissolveth six Drachms and a Scruple or
above ¾ of an Ounce of common <hi>Salt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>22. §. Of <hi>Nitre,</hi> Five Drachms two Scruples and an half.</p>
                  <p>23. §. Of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> five Drachms and two Scruples.</p>
                  <p>24. §. Of <hi>Alum,</hi> not above two Drachms and a Scruple.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>5. §. And of <hi>Borax,</hi> not above a Drachm and half a Scruple.</p>
                  <p>26. §. Of these note, That although Common <hi>Salt</hi> be very disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble,
and will presently catch the moysture of the <hi>Aer:</hi> yet a much
greater quantity not only of <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> but even of <hi>Loaf Sugar,</hi>
and of <hi>Green Vitriol</hi> it self, may be dissolved in <hi>Water</hi> than of Common
<hi>Salt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>27. §. Again, as the great <hi>Solubility</hi> of some, so the less <hi>Solubility</hi>
of other <hi>Salts</hi> is also observable, as of <hi>Alum,</hi> and <hi>Borax.</hi> For the same
quantity of <hi>Water</hi> will dissolve near four times as much of <hi>Green Vitriol,</hi>
as it will of <hi>Alum.</hi> And of <hi>Sugar</hi> more than ten times as much. Of
<hi>Green Vitriol</hi> near eight times as much as of <hi>Borax;</hi> and of <hi>Sugar,</hi> twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
times as much.</p>
                  <p>28. §. From this Experiment we are likewise cautioned, not only
in the <hi>Infusion</hi> of several <hi>Ingredients</hi> together, but of any one singly;
that such a proportion thereof to the <hi>Menstruuum,</hi> be not exceeded.
For all that is over and above what the <hi>Menstruum</hi> will bear, is either not
extracted, or will be precipitated. As is evident not only in the <hi>Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi>
of the <hi>Salts</hi> above named, but in the <hi>Infusion</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> themselves:
as, for instance; of <hi>Senna;</hi> two Drachms whereof will impregnate
four Ounces of <hi>Water</hi> as strongly, as if twice the quantity were infused;
because the <hi>Water</hi> will bear no more of the <hi>Purgative Parts</hi> of that
<hi>Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>29. §. There is only one <hi>Salt</hi> more remaineth to be spoken of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this Experiment; and that is, the <hi>Crystals</hi> of <hi>Tartar.</hi> Whereof,
it is somewhat strange to observe, that it will scarce at all dissolve in
<hi>Water:</hi> not more, than even divers <hi>Resinous Gums,</hi> as <hi>Mastick, Tolu,
Tacchamahacca,</hi> and some others will do. For if two Drachms, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of these <hi>Crystals,</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> (commonly sold for <hi>Cremor Tartari)</hi>
be put to one Ounce of <hi>Water,</hi> scarce five Grains thereof will, by <hi>Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
be therein dissolved.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. In which is shewed, that by the Solution of Salts in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
some certain space, more or less, is gained. That
the space is different according to the Nature of the Salt.
And what the just space is, which is gained.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Fifth</hi> Enquiry is, Whether by dissolving of
a <hi>Salt</hi> in <hi>Water,</hi> there be any space gained, or
not. That is, whether the <hi>Bulk</hi> of the <hi>Water</hi> be
greater before the <hi>Salt</hi> lying in it be fully dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
than afterwards. For tryal whereof, I
took a <hi>Bolt-head</hi> with a slender <hi>Neck,</hi> holding
somewhat more than a pint; and filling it up to
a certain place in the <hi>Neck;</hi> I then put in an
Ounce or two of <hi>Salt.</hi> And observing the hight
of the <hi>Water,</hi> both before it was dissolved, and afterwards; It plainly
appeared, that there was some, and that a considerable space, gained
by the <hi>Dissolution;</hi> the <hi>Water</hi> thereby sinking several Inches below
the place, where it stood after the <hi>Salt</hi> was first put into it.</p>
                  <p>2. §. From this Experiment it is plain, that there are <hi>Vacuities</hi> in
<hi>Water.</hi> That is to say, that all the parts of <hi>Water</hi> are not contiguous,
but that either betwixt, or in the <hi>Atomes</hi> of the <hi>Water</hi> themselves, there
are certain <hi>Pores,</hi> either absolutely void, or at least filled up with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more subtile body which is easily excluded by the particles of
<hi>Salt:</hi> by possessing the room of which the above said space is gained.</p>
                  <p>3. §. The <hi>Sixth</hi> Enquiry is, Whether the space be equally gained,
by an equal encrease of the same <hi>Salt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. §. For this I made two tryals; the first was this. Two half
Ounces of <hi>Salt Armoniac,</hi> being successively dissolved in the same <hi>Water;</hi>
both of them raised up the <hi>Water</hi> in the <hi>Neck</hi> of the <hi>Bolt-head,</hi> equally;
the first 3 Inches ⅞, and so the second.</p>
                  <p>5. §. The other was this. Four half Ounces of <hi>Nitre,</hi> being suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively
dissolved in the same <hi>Water,</hi> they all of them raised up the
<hi>Water</hi> in the <hi>Neck</hi> of the <hi>Bolt-head,</hi> equally; the first a little above
two Inches, and the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, just as much.</p>
                  <p>6. §. The <hi>Seventh</hi> Enquiry is, Whether upon the <hi>Dissolution</hi> of
several kinds of <hi>Salts,</hi> be gained so many several quantities of space.
For this I made tryal upon Eleven several <hi>Salts,</hi> sc. <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar,
Common Salt, Sal Gemmeus, Roman Vitriol, Nitre, White Vitriol, Green
Vitriol, Alum, Borax, Loaf-Sugar,</hi> and <hi>Sal Armoniac;</hi> of all which, I
dissolved an equal quantity <hi>sc.</hi> two Ounces, in an equal quantity of
<hi>Water,</hi> severally; that is, taking fresh <hi>Water</hi> for every <hi>Solution.</hi> The
success was, That the <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> raised the <hi>Water</hi> 15 Inches. The
<hi>Loaf-Sugar,</hi> 13 Inches and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are plain, and most of them very remarquable: Two Ounces of <hi>Sal
Armoniac</hi> raising the <hi>Water</hi> near four times as high, as the same quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. §. From this and the fourth Experiment, compared, it also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
That the several spaces gained by the several <hi>Salts,</hi> though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they do, yet do not always answer to the <hi>Solubility</hi> of the said
<hi>Salts.</hi> As to give some Instances; <hi>Loaf-Sugar</hi> is the most dissoluble of
any other <hi>Salt;</hi> yet it gaineth less space than all the rest, save only
<hi>Sal Armoniac.</hi> So <hi>Green Vitriol</hi> is more dissoluble then either <hi>Nitre</hi>
or <hi>Common Salt;</hi> yet gaineth less space than either, especially than the
latter. And <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> which is more dissoluble than <hi>Alum</hi> or <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax,</hi>
yet gaineth less space than either of them. The <hi>Cause</hi> whereof
is not easily assigned.</p>
                  <p>8. §. Note also, that by the same Experiment, as well as by the
<hi>Taste</hi> and other Circumstances, it is plain, That <hi>Sal Gemmae</hi> is nothing
else but <hi>Common Salt,</hi> coagulated or <hi>Crystalliz'd</hi> under <hi>Ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. §. Again, as the Fifth Experiment sheweth, That there are
<hi>Vacuities</hi> in <hi>Water:</hi> so doth this Last, that those <hi>Vacuities,</hi> are of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
kinds. Because, otherwise, it should seem, That the <hi>Bulk</hi> of the
<hi>Water</hi> would increase, more or less, according to the <hi>Solubilitie</hi> of every
<hi>Salt,</hi> and not be alternately differenced as it is; Some <hi>Salts,</hi> more
dissoluble, increasing the <hi>Bulk</hi> of the <hi>Water</hi> less, and others less disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble,
increasing it more. I say, that this difference dependeth not
only upon the different <hi>Figures</hi> of the <hi>Atomes</hi> of <hi>Salt;</hi> because then
every <hi>Salt</hi> which is more dissoluble, would (quantity for quantity)
take up less room in the <hi>Water:</hi> which is contrary to the Experiment.</p>
                  <p>10. §. From the same Experiment, howsoever <hi>paradoxical</hi> it may
seem, yet is it also manifest, That although <hi>Water</hi> be a <hi>Fluid,</hi> yet the
<hi>Particles</hi> thereof are <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>consistent,</hi> and unalterable in their <hi>Figure.</hi>
Otherwise it is plain, That all manner of <hi>Salts</hi> would be dissolved in
the same manner, and take up the same room in the <hi>Water.</hi> For let
the <hi>Figures</hi> of the <hi>Salts</hi> be never so various, yet if the <hi>Particles</hi> of
<hi>Water</hi> were themselves <hi>Fluid</hi> or <hi>Inconsistent</hi> and <hi>Alterable,</hi> they would
always so conforme to those <hi>Figures,</hi> as to fill up all <hi>Vacuities;</hi> and so
upon the <hi>Solution</hi> of several <hi>Salts,</hi> if of equal quantity, the <hi>Water</hi>
would still retein an equal <hi>Bulk.</hi> As suppose an Ounce of <hi>Iron</hi> were
drawn into <hi>Wyer,</hi> another beaten into <hi>Plates,</hi> a third made into <hi>Hooks,</hi>
a fourth into <hi>Needles,</hi> a fifth into <hi>Nails;</hi> every one of these five Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
being put severally into <hi>Water</hi> will encrease its <hi>Bulk</hi> equally. I
conclude therefore, That the <hi>Atomes</hi> of <hi>Water</hi> are hard and unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>11. §. The <hi>Eighth</hi> Enquiry was this, What that just space
might be, which any <hi>Salt</hi> gaineth upon <hi>Dissolution,</hi> with respect to its
own <hi>Bulk,</hi> or the <hi>Bulk</hi> of the <hi>Water?</hi> For the making of this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Water</hi> will not serve, nor yet <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine;</hi> because they both
of them dissolve more or less of those <hi>Salts</hi> which are put into them;
whereby the observation of the true <hi>Bulk</hi> of the <hi>Salt,</hi> and consequently
of the just space it gaineth by <hi>Dissolution</hi> is lost. I took therefore <hi>Oyl</hi>
of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and pouring it into a <hi>Bolt-head,</hi> marked the place of
its ascent in the <hi>Neck.</hi> Then pouring likewise into it two Ounces of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:100350:177"/>
                     <hi>Common Salt,</hi> I marked the second ascent of the <hi>Oyl;</hi> and found it to
be 10 Inches and 6 eighths. Repeating the Experiment in like manner
with two Ounces of <hi>Nitre,</hi> I found the ascent of the <hi>Oyl</hi> to be 11 Inches
and ⅛<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Repeating it again with two Ounces of <hi>Alum,</hi> the ascent of
the <hi>Oyl</hi> was 13 Inches and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi rend="sup">ths.</hi> And making it once more with <hi>Sal
Armoniac,</hi> the <hi>Oyl</hi> ascended to 15 Inches: the said several ascents of the
<hi>Oyl</hi> being the true spaces which the Four abovesaid <hi>Salts</hi> take. From
which, the space which the same <hi>Salts</hi> take up upon <hi>Dissolution,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deducted; the remainder is the space gained by that <hi>Dissolution.</hi>
And so it appears, first, that <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> gaineth nothing; being the
only <hi>Salt</hi> of all I have tryed, which causeth the equal ascent both of the
<hi>Water</hi> and the <hi>Oyl sc.</hi> just 15 Inches in both. <hi>Alum</hi> causeth the ascent
of the <hi>Oyl</hi> to 13 2/8<hi rend="sup">ths</hi>, of the <hi>Water,</hi> to 11 Inches and ⅝<hi rend="sup">ths</hi>: So that it
gains about 1 Inch and ½ out of 13. <hi>Nitre</hi> causeth the ascent of the
<hi>Oyl,</hi> to 11 Inches and ⅛<hi rend="sup">th</hi>; of the <hi>Water,</hi> to 8 Inches and ⅜<hi rend="sup">ths.</hi> So that
<hi>Nitre</hi> by <hi>Dissolution</hi> gets almost the space of 3 Inches in 11. <hi>Common
Salt</hi> causeth the ascent of the <hi>Oyl,</hi> to 10 Inches and 6/8<hi rend="sup">ths</hi>; of the <hi>Water,</hi>
6 Inches and ⅜<hi rend="sup">ths.</hi> So that <hi>Common Salt</hi> gains by <hi>Dissolution</hi> 4 Inches in
10, which is very considerable.</p>
                  <p>12. §. By this way the <hi>Specifick Gravity</hi> of all kinds of <hi>Salts</hi> may
be easily taken, and the difference betwixt them is somewhat surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.
For it appears by the Ascent of the <hi>Oyl,</hi> that <hi>Nitre,</hi> quantity
for quantity, is about a 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part lighter than <hi>Common Salt. Alum</hi>
about a 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part lighter. And <hi>Salt Armoniac,</hi> almost a 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part lighter
than <hi>Common Salt.</hi> The like estimate may be made of the <hi>Gravity</hi> of
all other <hi>Salts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. §. By the same Experiment it also appears, That according to
the <hi>Specifick Gravity</hi> of <hi>Salts</hi> they are many times at least more or
less <hi>Volatile;</hi> as in the four last <hi>Salts</hi> is plain. For <hi>Common Salt</hi> which
of all the four is the most fixed, is also the heavyest. <hi>Nitre</hi> which is
somewhat less fixed is somewhat lighter. But <hi>Alum</hi> which is still less
fixed is much lighter. And <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> which is wholly <hi>Volatile,</hi> is
the lightest of all the <hi>Salts</hi> above mentioned.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR the doing of this, it will first be acknowledg'd,
That not only several sorts of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> but also of
<hi>Volatile Salts,</hi> are continually sublimed from most
<hi>Bodies</hi> into the <hi>Aer.</hi> So <hi>Lightning,</hi> from the celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the accension, appears to be made of a <hi>Meteor,</hi>
which is <hi>Nitro-Sulphureous. Snow</hi> dependeth upon
a <hi>Mixture</hi> of <hi>Nitrous,</hi> and other <hi>Salts;</hi> as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
from the regularly and differently <hi>Figur'd Parts,</hi> which compose
the whole Body of a <hi>Snowy Cloud,</hi> before it clusters into <hi>Flakes.</hi> And
one reason, why <hi>Rain</hi> is the best <hi>Water</hi> for any <hi>Soyl,</hi> is because it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with divers <hi>Volatile</hi> and <hi>Fruitful Salts.</hi> And so from other
<hi>Meteors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. §. And next, that these <hi>Salts,</hi> are not always in the same <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
Proportion,</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> in the <hi>Aer:</hi> but that sometimes they are
more copious; at others, less: sometimes, one more copious, than an
other: sometimes, more plentifully dissolved; at others, more spare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly:
and that, either as they are more or less pure and dissoluble; or
according to the quantity of the <hi>Vaporous Parts</hi> in the <hi>Aer,</hi> in which
they are incorporated or dissolved.</p>
                  <p>3. §. Thus much being granted, from the <hi>Experiments</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<hi>Chapter</hi> compared together, we may resolve our selves about
some <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in the <hi>Barometre.</hi> Which seems to vary, not so much
with the meer <hi>Weight</hi> of the <hi>Aer,</hi> which hitherto hath been suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
as by the different pressure it makes, in being <hi>crowded</hi> more at
one time, than at another. That is, according as certain <hi>Nitrous,</hi> or
other <hi>Saline Bodies,</hi> take up less <hi>Space</hi> in the <hi>Aer,</hi> when dissolved in the
<hi>Watery Parts</hi> therein, than while they are undissolved.</p>
                  <p>4. §. And therefore it is especially to be observed, That as the
<hi>Mercury</hi> commonly riseth in the <hi>Cylinder</hi> for some days, but always
for some time, before the change of the <hi>Weather,</hi> whether for <hi>Snow</hi> or
<hi>Rain:</hi> So, that then it presently falleth again, even before the <hi>Snow</hi>
or <hi>Rain</hi> falls. Whereas, if the <hi>Weight</hi> of the <hi>Aer,</hi> were the only, or
the chief <hi>Cause</hi> of the ascent of the <hi>Mercury;</hi> than as it riseth all the
while the <hi>Weather</hi> is gathering, so it would keep its standing or heighth,
until the <hi>Weather</hi> breaks and falleth down: which yet it never doth,
but always falls before it; sometimes no less than a whole day. The
<hi>Cause</hi> whereof is, in that all the while the <hi>Mercury</hi> riseth in the <hi>Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
the <hi>Aer</hi> is <hi>crowded</hi> with more and more <hi>Saline Parts,</hi> which by
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:100350:178"/>
the <hi>Winds,</hi> or otherwise, are carryed into it; and so causeth it to
press upon the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the <hi>Box:</hi> but after that in some time the
<hi>Salts</hi> are dissolved or incorporated in the <hi>Aqueous Parts</hi> of the <hi>Aer,</hi> as
in <hi>Rain</hi> or <hi>Snow;</hi> so soon as that is done, there is some <hi>Space</hi> gaind; and
so, before any <hi>Weather</hi> falleth, the <hi>Aer</hi> is less crowded, and presseth
less upon the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the <hi>Box,</hi> which gives way to its descent in
the <hi>Cylinder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. §. From hence also it is, that the <hi>Mercury</hi> riseth higher with
<hi>Cold Winds,</hi> than it doth with those which are <hi>Warme.</hi> Both because
that in <hi>cold Winds</hi> there is the greatest quantity of <hi>Nitre:</hi> and that the
<hi>coldest Winds,</hi> are usually the dryest. So that the <hi>Nitre</hi> wanting
<hi>Moysture</hi> fully to dissolve it; it takes up so much the greater space, and
so causeth a greater pressure in the <hi>Aer,</hi> as hath been said.</p>
                  <p>6. §. <hi>Lastly,</hi> For the same reason it comes to pass, that the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
first riseth higher, and then falleth lower before <hi>Snow,</hi> than it doth
before <hi>Rain.</hi> Because that for the production of <hi>Snow,</hi> the <hi>Aer</hi> is
crowded with a greater quantity of <hi>Nitre,</hi> or some other like <hi>Salts;</hi>
which before they are dissolved, take up so much the more space;
and afterwards so much the less, even before the <hi>Snow</hi> falls: as hath
been proved.</p>
