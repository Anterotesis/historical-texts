            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Orphans Caſe.</head>
            <p>WHEREAS the Court of Aldermen made an Order in <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
1687. That all Improvements of every Branch of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
over and above the Neceſſary Support of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſhould be applyed towards the Payment of their Debts,
and Publiſhed the ſame in the <hi>Gazette.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We, the diſtreſſed Orphans of the City of <hi>London,</hi> would
(if poſſible) propoſe for our Relief that which might anſwer our Juſt Debts, and
not offend our Guardians, ſo as to make them our Enemies to oppoſe a Bill for our
Relief, as hitherto they have done.</p>
            <p>We are ſo far from ſtreightning the Government of the City, that we are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
willing, but deſirous that this Honourable Houſe will allow them ſufficient, not
only for the neceſſary part, but likewiſe for the Splendour of their Government.</p>
            <p>We find by the Account brought into this Honourable Houſe, by Order of the
25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1692. the City did make the Charge of their Government to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
unto the Sum of 9036 <hi>l.</hi> 7 <hi>s.</hi> or thereabouts.</p>
            <p>We humbly conceive the following Sums given in by that Account, are not to
be paid out of the Chamber of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Workmens Wages and Materials to repair the City's publick Buildings, 1500 <hi>l.</hi>
For Pavements, Amendments of Ways and Shores, belonging to the City 420 <hi>l.</hi>
becauſe theſe Sums by Cuſtom and Uſage of the City of <hi>London</hi> ought to be raiſed
by<note n="*" place="margin">The not rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by Fifteens hath been the Cauſe of the Debts being ſo great.</note> Fifteens upon the Perſonal Eſtates of the Citizens.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Account is charged for Taxes 1000 <hi>l.</hi> every one that receives ought
to pay his proportion to the Taxes, therefore not to be charged in the Account.</p>
            <p>There is alſo Charged for Intereſt of 2700 <hi>l.</hi> 162 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> which ought not to
be in that Account.</p>
            <p>And the Sollicitors Bills <hi>per</hi> eſtimate 500 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> 300 <hi>l.</hi> of this may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted,
the Orphans being to pay what relates to them.</p>
            <p>Theſe Deductions being made, the Charge of the Government will then be
5654 <hi>l.</hi> 7 <hi>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May it pleaſe this Honourable Houſe to give the diſtreſſed Orphans leave to
propoſe, that the Government may have paid out of the Chamber of <hi>London</hi> 6000 <hi>l.
per ann.</hi> to diſcharge the aforeſaid, Sum of 5654 <hi>l.</hi> 7 <hi>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Power be given by Act of Parliament to raiſe 2000 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> on Perſonal
Eſtates, by Act of Common Council for repair of publick Works in the ſaid
City (if occaſion be) which formerly was, and ought to be raiſed by Fifteens.</p>
            <p>The Bridge-Houſe Eſtate being about 3000 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> Ground-Rent, the Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
with the Fines for Leaſes renewed, being ſufficient to keep the Bridge in good
Repair, the remainder to be paid into the Chamber for the City's uſe, as formerly.</p>
            <p>The Lord Mayor to have as formerly his Certainty of about 2000 <hi>l. per ann.</hi>
The Lord Mayor and Sheriffs to have the preſenting of all Officers, as formerly,
except the Cole-Meeters and Corn-Meeters; which Officers places that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
to the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs with Fines for Offences committed in the
City of <hi>London,</hi> and Fellons Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be eſtimated at 4000 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> at leaſt.</p>
            <p>The Lord Mayor and Sheriffs by this propoſal will have 6000 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> and the
Government 8000 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> beſides the Advantage of the Bridge-Houſe Eſtate.</p>
            <p>We farther implore this Honourable Houſe, that in Mercy and Compaſſion to our
Diſtreſſed Condition, you will be pleaſed to raiſe by a Duty on Coles, or what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way in your great Wiſdom you ſhall think meet, the Sum of 10000 <hi>l. per
ann.</hi> which with the 6000 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> that remains of the City's Eſtate, making in
all 16000 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> and what ever this falls ſhort at preſent of 4 <hi>l. per Cent. per
Annum</hi> of our Principal and Intereſt, we may have Credit for, and be paid as
the Revenue of the City is improved, until the whole 4 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> be ſecured; and
if any Overplus after this to go to the City, and to be managed by a ſtanding
Committee of Common Council.</p>
            <p>Whereas there is 6000 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> propoſed for the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, part of
which is Caſual, and may be more or leſs, as Offices fall, the Orphans do humbly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
(if the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs ſhall rather chuſe a Certainty) that they may
have 5000 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> paid them out of the Chamber of <hi>London</hi> in lieu thereof; and
whatever the Income is by Vertue of their Offices, may be paid into the Chamber of
<hi>London,</hi> for the Uſe of the Orphans.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why the Orphans have propoſed theſe Methods to have the utmoſt that
poſſible may be raiſed by the Revenue of the City, when the neceſſary Charge of the
Government is paid (as in Juſtice they ought) is, that they may be the leſs burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to this Honourable Houſe at this time, when Publick Taxes are great.</p>
            <p>The Orphans are ſo well ſatisfied in this Fund humbly propoſed, that they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to give ſuch Releaſes for their reſpective Debts as your great Wiſdoms ſhall
pleaſe to appoint.</p>
