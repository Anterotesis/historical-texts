            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

COPPY OF A
LETTER WRIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEN
TO THE LOWER
House of Parliament touching
divers greivances and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
of the State &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>To my Noble friends of the lower House
of Parliament.</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F my Country had held me worthy to
have served in this Parliament, I had
now beene made a member of your
lower house as formerly I have beene
in sundry other Parliaments, but how
unkindly so ever shee dealeth with
me, I will ever shew my thankfulnesse to her, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
by way of observation what I have heretofore
learned in that grave and wise assembly for admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the elder, and a pathway for the younger to
walke in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:93616:3"/>
Parliaments in my time have beene wonte to take
up some space at the first meeting to settle the House
and to determine of unlawfull elections, and in this
point they never had greater cause to bee circumspect,
then at this time for by an abuse lately crept in, there
is introduced a custome which if it bee not foreseene
and prevented will bee great derogation to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and a weakening to the power of your house,
where the law giveth a freedome to Corporations to
elect Burgesses and forbiddeth any indirect course to
bee taken in their election many of the Corporations
are become so base minded and timerous, that they will
not hazard the indignation of a Lord Lieutenants let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who underhand stickes not to threaten them with
the charge of a Musket or a horse at a Muster, if that he
hath not the election of the Burgesses, and not they
themselves.</p>
            <p>And commonly those that the Lords recommend
are such as desire it for protection, or are so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the place they serve for, as that there being an
occasion to speake of the Corporation for which they
are chosen, they have asked their Neighbours sitting
by whether it were a Sea or Land Towne. If you
seeke not to prevent this kind of choyce, these
mischiefes will follow:</p>
            <p>1. The freedome of the Subject will bee lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>2. The priviledge of Corporations will bee abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
men outlawed, and law breakers, will bee law ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</p>
            <p>3. The voices of your House shall bee at the dispose
of the Lords of the upper House, and the assembly of
the Commons will be made needelesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:93616:3"/>
Gentlemen of farre remote Countries, may spare
their labour to come up, for there we shall bee contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
with two yeares, and that by such men, if they
be examined, and are not liable to taxes, Subsidies,
Loanes, or other payments, they shall enjoy their
ends, to wit liberty and freedome, and the Lords
dispose of such lawes as they shall purpose.</p>
            <p>The next thing that is required, is liberty of speech,
without which Parliaments have little force or
power; speeches begets doubts, and resolves them, and
doubtes in Schooles get understanding, he that doubtes
much asketh often, and learnes much, and he that feares
the worst, soonest prevents a mischiefe.</p>
            <p>This priviledge of speech is antiently granted by
the testimony of <hi>Philip Comines</hi> a stranger who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres
our Parliaments, and the freedome of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in them, above all other assemblies, which free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
if it bee broken or diminished is negligently
lost, since the dayes of <hi>Comines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If freedome of speech should bee prohibited when
men with modesty make repetition of the grievances
&amp; enormities of the Kingdome, when men shall desire
reformation of wrongs &amp; injuries committed, &amp; have
no relation of evill thought to his Majesty. But with
open heart and zeale expresse their dutifull &amp; reverent
respect to him and his service: I say if this kind of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of speech be not allowed in time of Parliament,
they will extend no farther then to quarter Sessions, &amp;
their meetings and assemblies will be unnecessary for
all meanes of disorder new crept in, and all reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and redresses will be quite taken away.</p>
            <p>As it is no manners to contest with the King in
his election of Councellors and Servants (for Kings
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93616:4"/>
obey no men) but their lawes, so were it a great neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and part of treason for a subject not to bee in
speech against the abuses wrongs &amp; offences that may
bee occasioned by persons in authority, what remedy
can bee expected from a Prince to the Subjects if the
enormities of his Kingdome be concealed from him,
or what King so religious or just in his owne nature,
that may not hazard the losse of the hearts of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
without this liberty of speech in Parliament.
For such is the misfortune of most Princes, and such
is the unhappines of Subjects, where Kings affections
are settled, and their loves so farre transported to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
servants, as they onely trust and credit what
they shall informe.</p>
            <p>In this case what Subject dares complaine, or what
Subject dares contradict the words or actions of such
a Servant, if it be not warranted by freedome of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
they speaking with humility, for nothing
obtaineth favour so much with a King, as diligent obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>The surest and safest way betwixt the King and his
people, and least scandall of partiality with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,
with integrity and sincerity to examine the
grievances of the Kingdome, without touching upon
the person of any man further then the cause giveth
occasion; for otherwise you shall contest with him
that hath the Princes eares open, to hearken to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted
tongue, hee informes secretly, when you
shall not be admitted to excuse, hee will cast your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
malice against him to your contempt against the
King, and seeking to lessen his authority, hee
will make the Prince, the sheild of his revenge.</p>
            <p>These are the sinister practises of such servants to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93616:4"/>
their Soveraignes, when these grievances shall be
authentically proved and made manifest to the World,
by your paines to examine, and freedome to speake, no
Prince can be so affectionate to a servant, or such an
enemy to himselfe, as not to admit of this indifferent
proceeding, if his services be allowable and good they
will appeare with glory: if bad, your labour shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
thankes both of Prince and Countrey, when ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
shall thus shine, people will bee animated to serve
their King with integrity; for they are naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to imitate Princes in good, or bad: the words
of <hi>Cicero</hi> will then appeare, that malitious and evill
men make Princes poore, and one perfect good man
is able to make a Realme rich.</p>
            <p>One case I will instance, that is common in the
mouthes of all people, and generally <hi>vox populi, vox
Dei;</hi> If one of quality in the last expedition to the Isle
of <hi>Rhee</hi> endeavoured to conceale the number of men
lost in the last encounter, and confidently affirmed their
number not to exceed three or foure hundred, till a
Doctor of phisick out of tendernesse of conscience and
duty to his Majesty could not dissemble, the vulgar
and true report, but acquainted his Majesty of 2000.
of his Subjects there lost, this was so contrary to the
first information, and so displeasing to the Informer
and his designes, that hee caused the Physitians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moove,
from his highnesse presence, who yet remaines
in kind of a banished man.</p>
            <p>The truth of this two reports is easily determined
by the Clarkes of the bands of each Company, and is
worthy to be discovered for truths sake, truth being
so noble of it selfe, as it will make him honourable
that pronounceth it, lyes, may shadow it, but not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93616:5"/>
darken it, they may blame but never shame it, by this
small precedent his Majesty shall see himselfe abused,
and it may bee a meanes for him to reflect, both upon
men and matter.</p>
            <p>The men slaine are no lesse injured by concealing
their names, whose lives were lost for King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> would have held it the highest honour
for their friends and posterity so to doe, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
may feare that those that stick not so palpably
to wrong a King, may as unjustly cast aspersions upon
the house and other his loving Subjects.</p>
            <p>There is no remedy left for thse mis-reports, but a
freedome of speech in Parliament, for there is no wise
man, but knowes what and when to speake, and how
to hold his peace, whilest Subjects tongues are tied,
for feare they may reach him a rap, whose conscience
cries guilty; The King and his people are kept from
understanding one another, the enemy is hartened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and the malignant humour of discontent nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
at home, and all for one who is like a Dragon
that bites the eares of the Elephant, because he knowes
the Elephant cannot reach him with his Trunke; And
Princes are abused by false reports, whispered in their
eares by Sicophants and Flatterers. <hi>Diogines</hi> being
asked what Beast bite soarest, answered of wild Beasts
the Backbiter, of tame the Flatterer.</p>
            <p>Now to discend to grievances which are of two
kinds:</p>
            <p>First, Some concerning the Kingdome in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Some in particular, which have relation
to the generall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:93616:5"/>
The grievances in generall are so many as will serve
for every member of your House to present two a
peece to your viewes; and because I cannot bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
amongst you my selfe, yet in regard I have
beene a member of you, I will presume so farre as to
ranke my selfe with you, and to tender the number of
two to your consideration.</p>
            <p>1. My first complaint is of titles of honour, and
that in two kinds.</p>
            <p>First, In respect of the parties themselves, their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
and parentage.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In respect of the manner of their attaining
therunto, which is mercenary, ease, and corrupt, which
in reason should not hold, for by Law the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is unlawfull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trajan</hi> commended <hi>Plutarch</hi> for his precepts in
Schoole, when hee taught that men should labour to
deserve honour, but avoid the getting of it basely, for
if it were reputation to have it by desert, it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie
to buy it for money; in that age, where rich men
were honoured, good men were despised.</p>
            <p>Honour is not to bee valued according to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
opinion of men, but prized and esteemed as the
surname of vertue ingendred in the mind, and such
honour, no King can or men can purchase; Hee that
will strive to bee more honourable then others, ought
to abandon passion, pride, and arrogancy; that so
his vertue may shine above others, for honour consists
not in the title of a Lord, but in the opinion people
have of his vertue, for it is much more honour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and not to have it, then to have it, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it.</p>
            <p>There is one of three things that commonly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93616:6"/>
a mans advancement, desert, favour, and
power.</p>
            <p>1. The first makes a man worthy of it, the other
two are but abuses; for favour is but a blind fortune, an
ounce of which at Court is better then a pound of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
fortune never favoreth but flattereth; shee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
promiseth, but in the end shee deceiveth; shee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
raiseth, but shee casteth downe againe, and this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
is meeter to bee called luck, then merit.
That honour, that is compassed by power, takes unto
it selfe liberty, and desires not to bee governed by
wisedome, but force; It knowes not what it desires,
nor hath a feeling of any injury, it is neither mooved
with sweet words, nor pittifull teares; such men leave
not to doe evill, because they have a desire to it, but
when their power faileth to doe it; The true honour
amongst the honorablest, is where fortune casteth
downe, where there is no fault; but it is infamy where
fortune raiseth, where there is no merit.</p>
            <p>Examine the state and condition of men raised to
honour these five and twenty yeares past, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be desert, favour, or power that hath preferred
them.</p>
            <p>Enter into the mischiefe the Kingdome hath suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and doth suffer by it, and the cause of his Majesties
great wants will soone appeare.</p>
            <p>Collect with your selves, how many poore and
needy companions have beene raised to the highest
top of honour, then will it appeare whether desert,
favour, or power advanced them.</p>
            <p>After this examine, their Princely expences in these
five and twenty yeares, their estates in present, and
what is requisite to maintaine their future degrees of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93616:6"/>
honour, to themselves and their posterity, and you shall
find his Majesties annuall revenewes consumed and
spent upon those unworthy persons, besides the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring
and impoverishing of the state, it bringing
with it the contempt of greatnesse and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>It breeds an inward malice in Gentlemen better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
of their Country, better able to maintain the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of honour without charge to King or Kingdome,
and whose houses and alliance may better challenge
then the best of them.</p>
            <p>It breeds discontent in the meaner sort of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to see his Majesties wealth and revenewes of the
Kingdome, thus wasted and consumed, whereby his
Majesty is enforced to exact from them, who would
otherwise bee able to helpe himselfe.</p>
            <p>The ancient and great Nobility of the land cannot
choose, but inwardly fret to see themselves ranked
yea overtopped by these men, that once would have
thought it an honour to bee a follower of theirs.</p>
            <p>The second abuse of honour is the base and merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
buying of it, observe commonly what these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are by birth, and mark the manner of their and their
Fathers getting of wealth to compasse this title, and
you shall find them people most odious to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
by their extortion usury and other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
kind of getting.</p>
            <p>Can there bee a greater grievance to a noble mind,
then to see these upstart families by their unsufferable
misery, penury, and extortion growne to wealth, to
preceede the best of you in ranke, degree, and calling,
whose Ancestors have lost their lives for King and
Country, and your selves in many respects more able
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93616:7"/>
and capable of serving your Prince and Common-wealth,
then they and every way better deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
            <p>The character of a covetous man is, that hee getteth
his goods with care, and envy of his Neighbours;
with sorrow to his enemies, with travell to his body,
with griefe to his Spirit, with scruple to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
with danger to his soule, with suite to his
children, and curse to his heires, his desire is to live
poore, to die rich; But as these vices are made ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
even so is hee honoured for them with title of
Nobility.</p>
            <p>It is a strange ambition of some of them to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
the degrees of Earles, Viscounts, and Barons of
other Countries, as of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> onely for
the name of a Lord, for no other priviledge they can
challenge in <hi>England,</hi> if they commit any criminall
offences, they shall bee tried by an ordinary jury, and
hanged, if they stood in danger of arrest (as I thinke
they are not much inriched by their title) they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to catch-pooles, and a Dungion in the Counter
may be their Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>And seeing their pride makes them covet to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
themselves from you, and to become <hi>Scots</hi> and
<hi>Irish,</hi> you can doe no lesse in requitall, but make an Act,
that so long as they hold the titles of Forrainers,
they be made uncapable to sit in the House of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or to enjoy any freedome more then his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Few, of you are there, that have not seene. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
highly praised in <hi>England,</hi> and much esteemed
abroad, and none of you now liveth, but to see it abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and liberty with too great familiarity in use, the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93616:7"/>
State of the Court, and reputation of Lords, are much
decayed and boldnesse with contempt crept in, and
no way to bee redressed but by a gentle speech in
Parliament, that so his Majesty may see the mischiefe
of it, and reforme it, for it rests onely in his power, who
onely hath power to create honour.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Philip</hi> the second King of <hi>Spaine</hi> entred with
Armes upon his Kingdome of <hi>Portugall,</hi> and that with
his sword, hee might have any fitting lawes, yet were
there foure priviledges which the <hi>Portugals</hi> besought
they might enjoy; One, whereof was that the King
would make no unworthy person noble without their
approbation, which was granted them, And to this
day, they hold that freedome, which keepes that
Kingdome in the ancient state honour and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
That is to say, two Dukes, one Marquesse, and
eighteen Earles; and thus much for the point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>The second grievance, I will recommend to your
viewes, is the carriage of our Warres, the excessive
charges vainely spent therein, the unworthinesse of
the people imployed, the grave experience neglected,
the designes not warranted by reason and discretion,
and the executions worse performed, with many other
circumstances, that depend upon it.</p>
            <p>But before I proceede herein, I must crave leave to
speake to two points.</p>
            <p>The one to declare the property and condition of
Impostures and Deceavers of Princes.</p>
            <p>In the other, I must cleare the House of Parliament,
of an imputation cast upon it.</p>
            <p>Abusers of Princes are they, that perswade them to
Warre, to become poore, when they may live in peace,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93616:8"/>
and become rich, when they may be loved, causeth
them to bee hated, when they may enjoy their lives
securely, put them in hazard of crosse fortune rashly;
And lastly having necessity to use their Subjects,
puts them into that necessity, as they refuse to doe for
him, all this is pride of the perswader as <hi>Socrates</hi>
saith.</p>
            <p>In the second, I will cleare the Parliament, in which
I was a member, of an ingratefull aspersion cast upon
it, that is to say, that the Parliament was a cause to
draw his Majesty into Warre, and failed on their part
to contribute towards it.</p>
            <p>These have beene often repeated and the Parliament
accused, the contrary hath beene as often reiterated,
and the truth expressed how farre the Parliament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
therein, but to stop the mouths of such false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
and to free the Parliament of such a calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I must use this Argument.</p>
            <p>At the assembly at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Parliament being
prorogued thither, money was required of us towards
the furnishing of his Majesties Fleet, then preparing u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
many reasons alledged too tedious now to repeat;
with one consent it was refused, whereupon there was
offer made by him that next the King seemed to have
best authority, that if they would, but contribute
40000.l. they should choose their enemy.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I enferre, that before that proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there was no enemy, and therefore no Warres.</p>
            <p>The motion of money being denied, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
instantly brake up, and seeing no enemy was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated,
nor money consented to by us; I see not how
the house can bee taxed for peace breakers, but rather
the name cast upon some young men, for youth by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93616:8"/>
is prone to pride, especially where experience
wants, they are credulous what they heare that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them, and incredulous with what is told them
by wise men, they are despisers of others Councels,
and very poore in their owne, they are dangerous for
Princes to relie on, for selfe-will is of greater force,
then precepts.</p>
            <p>Now to proceede in <hi>October</hi> following the Fleete
put to Sea, and what they did is apparant by relation
written by their Generall at his returne.</p>
            <p>The voyage being ended another followed the
next Summer under the command of that noble Lord
the Earle of <hi>Linsey,</hi> which through the weakenesse
and dissability of the Ships was not able to performe
what he had in charge, and what he desired.</p>
            <p>The last and most lamentable was that to the Isle
of <hi>Rhee</hi> which I likewise referre to a man I have
seene, and to the Bookes printed and extant.</p>
            <p>These, with that to <hi>Algiers,</hi> to make up a messe of
Island voyages, I wish might be referred to examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of choyce and experienced souldiers by land and
by Sea, to report their opinions of it, that so their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
their wastfull expences, their negligences, their
weake designes, and want of experience may appeare
with the successe that might have proved, if advice
and councell had had preheminence above will and
arrogancy; for hee that is ignorant of truth and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and led away with pride of his owne opinions
must needs erre.</p>
            <p>After it hath past your approbation it is worth his
Majesties view, who then shall see the difference of
actions well managed, and rash and heady enterprises
undertaken by ignorance, and performed with folly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:93616:9"/>
Busines of so great a consequence ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
of Councell and not onely of the necessity
profit and honour, but of the possibility that was
like to follow, for an action well begun is halfe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>My experience in Discipline of Warres by Land
and Sea, can say no more then to referre it to others,
for it is a course, I never was bred to in my youth, and
now to late in my age to practise, onely one thing I
observe, that in the two vogayes of <hi>Cadeze</hi> and <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee,</hi>
in the first a Land souldier commanded at Sea, who
knew not what belonged thereunto; And the other
was carried by him that was no souldier neither by
Land nor by Sea, and the successe proved accordingly
in both, yet their errours were never questioned, but
they both highly advanced.</p>
            <p>In my opinion the charge they tooke upon them
was as improper as for a Merchant to become a
Judge, for I have ever heard, that there are five things
necessary in a Generall, to wit knowledge, valor, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
authority, and fortune; The last whereof but
one had beene better spared at the Isle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> for also
late authority joyned with wilfulnesse of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
was the utter bane of the action, as the relation tels us.</p>
            <p>And it is no marvell, for according to the old say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the best Fencer is not alwayes the best Fighter,
the fairest Tilter not the best experienced Souldier,
nor the eare of the favorite at the Court, the best Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
of an Host. And whosoever every takes upon
him that command beholds himselfe in a false Glas, that
makes him seeme what hee is not, as on the contrary
experience is the Mother of prudence, and prudence
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93616:9"/>
will not take Councell, least shee joyne her will
with her will, hastinesse causeth repentance, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse
causeth hinderance.</p>
            <p>For the evils that followed upon these two
voyages, your selves are sufficient witnesses, and can
judge of it.</p>
            <p>As namely the billetting of Souldiers in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and bringing their Ships in harbours, not abating
the entertainement of the one, nor the wages of the
other; And yet notwithstanding, this needlesse cost
and charges, our ships and coasts are daylie infested,
in such sort as we dare not peepe out of harbour.</p>
            <p>Were the carriage of things now answerable to
the prudence and presidents of former times, wee
cannot pretend a feare of invasion, because our Ships
are divided into severall harbours, and our Souldiers
billetted in inward Countries, besides the season of
the yeare giveth no oportunity to an enemy to attempt
it.</p>
            <p>Here is a masse of wealth carelesly consumed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King or Subject beare it, &amp; no man bettered,
but onely those that have the titles of Souldiers, yet
never had the happinesse or honour to see what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained
to service, they are taught insteade of
worke, by which they have lived and beene bred,
now to spend their time in idlenesse, &amp; ale-houses, and
to forget their occupations, their example of disorder
encourageth other to follow their liberty.</p>
            <p>People that were wont to live poorely, yet safely,
are now by their fellowes and their followers, robbed
and spoiled, and no remedy for redresse.</p>
            <p>The rich stand upon their guard and dare not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
to Church, least in their absence, their houses bee
surprized and rifled.</p>

mouthes besides the Inhabitants should live on the

and penury of victuals, if they should in earnest be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by an enemy.</p>
            <p>Would they have thought fit, the charge of it

all injuries from the hands of strange Souldiers, where
the meanest boy in the Island is thought to manage

            <p>No, but they would rather have thought it discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
upon the returne of those voyages to have caused
the men to repaire to the place where they were pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and to have ordered that each parish should have

            <p>There is no part or place in <hi>England</hi> so remote

            <p>They would have thought it more wisedome to

needlesse and expencefull course that is taken.</p>
            <p>They would have judged it better, to have supplied
the Isle of <hi>Wight</hi> with 2000. men out of the maine

            <p>They would have thought it more fit to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned

            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> wants no men, and hath as good and able

            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> with small charge and trouble can raise
what men his Majesty pleaseth to command and that
suddenly, and discharge them againe without trouble
or charge as quickly.</p>
            <p>The Wisemen of <hi>England</hi> would have thought 2.
or 300000. pound better spared then thus wastfully
consumed and disorders committed, wee may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
it to that summe, and yet keepe our selves within
compasse, and notwithstanding the want of money,
and the wayes to exact it of the subject, is all the
song now sung; Hee that sees or complaines of the
evill managing of things, is either imprisoned, banisht
the Court or censured for a discontent.</p>
            <p>There is no <hi>Englishman,</hi> but knoweth the heart of
every other true hearted <hi>Englishman,</hi> and with one
consent will all obey their Prince, and to his person
owe all due reverence, and wee may truly say, no King
is more happy in Subjects for their love, nor never
subjects readier to serve their King, with their purses &amp;
persons, nor never people was better blest with a King,
who is endued with all kind of vertues, &amp; staynd with
no manner of vice, his mercy, his temper, his chastity,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93616:11"/>
and his meekenesse, is such as wee may say of him, as of
<hi>David,</hi> that hee is a man according to Gods owne
heart.</p>
            <p>But, if any man, shall poison, this opinion of ours,
by sinister reports, hee is a worker of sedition; Hee
hath a lying tongue, and speaketh not truth, hee is
worthy, to bee spued out, not of the Court, but even
from the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>False Informers and misguiders of good Kings,
are much more perilous, then if Princes themselves
were evill, for commonly as wormes breed soonest
in soft and sweet wood, so are the best natures (incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to honour, and Justice) soonest abused by false
Flatterers.</p>
            <p>The evill they commit, under the authority of good
Princes is accounted as done, by the Prince himselfe;
But commonly such people in the end, pay for it, for
hee that desires not to doe good, cannot bee wise, but
will fall into 4000. follies.</p>
            <p>One of the first propositions made to the house,
will bee for money to support his Majesties vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence;
at this time, that the enemy threatens thunder
against the Kingdome, your often Alarums, upon such
pretences may make you now to secure, for true it is,
that the last Parliament bookes were published of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
preparations intended against us, and nothing
came of it, but beware you bee not deceived, by an
old saying, that when one usually tels lies, he is not
trusted, when hee speakes truth, for certainely the
danger, is much more, then by the power and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of another enemy.</p>
            <p>In this case you must give for your owne
sakes, that so you may bee sure to enjoy what is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93616:12"/>
yours, for your soveraignes sake to maintaine his
greatnesse, and state, and for your Countries sake to
keepe it from oppression of the enemy, but withall
you ought to lay downe the condition of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and to shew that your necessity cannot para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell
with your hearts and desires, that your minds
will bee carried with a willingnes to give, but your
hands will keepe back your hearts for want of ability
to give.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Themistocles</hi> demanding tribute of the <hi>Athenians</hi>
told them hee brought two Gods with him, that is to
say, perswasion and violence, they answered that they
had other two Gods in their Countrey both great and
powerfull, which were poverty and impossibility
which hindred them from giving, but least this answer
should be poisoned or mis-reported to his Majesty
and wrested to the worst sense, I pray you to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the state and condition of every man in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and their impossibility of giving will appeare.</p>
            <p>What can bee hoped for, from the Merchant,
that is prohibited the greatest Trade of profit and

            </p>
            <p>What can we expect from the owners of Ships, that
have suffered more Shipwracks lately, then in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares before.</p>
            <p>What can wee looke for from the Husbandmen,
when Corne and Wooll is underfoote, for it was an
observation of the wise Lord Treasurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> that
every twelve pence abated in a stone of Wooll was
100000. pound losse to the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>What can bee required, from the multitude, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the little commerce, the dayly payments to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93616:12"/>
the King, to the Houses of correction, to the Poore, to
the maimed Souldiers, to the often appearing at
Musters, the altering of Armes, the watching of High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
the garding of Beacons, and other services at
the Justices command.</p>
            <p>What can Knights and Gentlemen give, their

falling and fayling.</p>
            <p>What can bee looked for, from the Clergy, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

yea though they came freely to their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
            <p>What can bee expected from the Trades-men or

people will bee contented with one suite of cloathes,
that two heretofore would not have served, shooes,
boots, hats, and all other apparell, they will Husband
after that proportion.</p>
            <p>There are two sorts of people in the Common-wealth
well able to give, the one the Vsurer which is
commonly free from all payments, in regard the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of most making them beholding to them, in
one kind or other, for themselves and their friends,
they in requitall shew him all possible ease and favour
in publique disbursements.</p>
            <p>The other are Noblemen and Gentlemen former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spoken of, that have had their advancement from
the King, and his Father, though not immediatly, but
Collaterally, for if you cast your eyes upon divers ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of great persons and remember what you have
knowne them, 10. or 12. yeares past, it would put
you into an admiration, yea some from Horsekeepers
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93616:13"/>
other base callings, are now promoted to the degrees
of Baronets, Knights and the like, for though that new
devised order of Baronets was first instituted for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
yet such is the fortune of servants, if one great
man that is their master, once preferre them to the
King, the first day they enjoy the dignities of Baronets;
when Gentlemen of great ranck and qualities that
have long served their Princes cannot compasse it
without consideration of money.</p>
            <p>When these things you shall collect and seriously
call to mind, you would thinke your selves these 12.
yeares last past a sleepe, and that you are now newly
wakened, you shall heare of many things past in that
space as making and removing of Treasurers, Keepers,
Secretaries, Judges, and all manner of Councellours
and Officers, with a million of such memorable and
unlookt for accidents.</p>
            <p>But leaving these as grievances and vexations to
the Subject, let us come to a neerer point which is the
safety of the Kingdome that the enemy threatens so
in danger, wee may truely say, that God hath so placed
and seated this Isle of <hi>England,</hi> that nothing but evill
councell can hurt it: but true it is, advice that is not
warranted from wise men, may prove more forcible
and perilous then the power of an enemy, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
telleth us that the thought perisheth that taketh
not Councell.</p>
            <p>A King of the Lacedemonians asked how a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
might ever stand; was answered two wayes, if a
King take Councell of wise honest men, that they
speake freely and doe justice uprightly.</p>
            <p>There was never Censor that judged, Senatour
that ordered, Emperour that commanded, Consull that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93616:13"/>
executed Orator that perswaded, nor any other mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
man but sometimes hee committed errours, and
deserved either blame or punishment for his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings,
and if hee were wise desired advise what to
doe.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, no man can give so faithfull
Councell, as hee who loves one more then his guift,
then who are or can bee so true Councellours to our
noble King as a house of Commons, that hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to a Kings guift, but onely to his honour flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
estate and safety.</p>
            <p>This is the time to amend evill Councels past, and
to let evill Councellours see their errours.</p>
            <p>This is the time for all men to put to their helpes,
some with their hands to fight, others with their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
to counsell.</p>
            <p>And for mine advice, this it is, that you present to
his Majesty in all humblenesse your, willing minds and
hearts to repaire and fit to Sea, his Majesty navy, your
selves to have power to make them able and servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
with the advice of experienced men, that you may
call unto you, this is a matter of great importance at
this present, for the safety of the Realme King and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
for the strength of the Kingdome much depends
upon this Bulwark, which wee may well tearme the
walles of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majesty shall find himselfe much eased by it,
businesses shall bee carried without his trouble or care,
moneyes shall not bee sought for to that end, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
by you, his Majesty may dispose of the rest of his
revenew at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>By your frugality and husbandry, his Majesty shall
have occasion to judge of things past, of yours in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93616:14"/>
and hereafter it will serve for a president to
walke after, It will stop the mouthes of malignant
tongues, that informe his Majesty of the unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Subject to give, and it will make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
that their true griefe is not in the matter of
giving, but to see the evill imploying of it, when it is
given.</p>
            <p>If any man shall prevent this good meaning and
motion of yours and infringe his Majesty, 'tis a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation
from his honour to yeeld to his Subjects
upon conditions. His Majesty shall have good cause
to prove such mens eyes malicious and unthankefull,
and thereby to disprove them in all their other acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for what can it lesson the reputations of a Prince,
whom the Subject onely and wholly obeyeth, that a
Parliament which his Majesty doth acknowledge
to bee his highest Councell should advise him, and hee
follow the advise of such a Councell what dishonour
rather were it to bee advised and ruled by one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
alone, against whom there is just exception
taken, of the whole Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marcus Portio</hi> saith, that, that Common-wealth
is everlasting where the Prince seeks to get obedience
and love, and the Subjects to gaine the affection of the
Prince, and that the Kingdome is unhappy where
their Prince is served out of ends and hope
of reward, and hath no other assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of them, but their
services.</p>
