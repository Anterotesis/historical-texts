            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>This Law or Declaration (being the firſt record making mention of their being, and condition in <hi>England:</hi>) proves, That as all the Jews when they came firſt into <hi>England,</hi> were under the Kings protection and patronage where ever they reſided: that they were under him only as his <hi>meer Vaſſals,</hi> their perſons and goods being his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; &amp; that they could diſpoſe of neither of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Licenſe: Into which ſlaviſh condition they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe then put themſelves, (being baniſhed out of other Nations for their Villanies) only to avoid the fury of the common people, to whom they were moſt deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who elſe would have quickly murdered, or ſton'd them to death, and ſtript them of all their wealth; as the ſequell will declare.</p>

            <p>This Hiſtory of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> cauſing a diſputation between the Chriſtians and the Jews, is related by <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael Holinſhed</hi> in his Chronicle; Vol. 3. p. 27. who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe records of him, <hi>That he being at</hi> Rhoan <hi>on a time, there came to him diverſe</hi> Jews, <hi>who inhabited that City, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining to him,</hi> that divers of that Nation had renounced their Jewiſh Religion, and were become Chriſtians: <hi>wherefore they beſought him,</hi> that for a certain ſumme of money which they offered to give, it might pleaſe him to conſtrain them to abjure Chriſtianity, and turn to the Jewiſh Law again. <hi>He was content to ſatisfie their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,</hi> and ſo <hi>receiving the money, called them before him; and what with threats, and putting them otherwiſe in fear, he compelled divers of them to forſake Christ, and to turn to their old errors.</hi> Hereupon, the Father of one <hi>Stephen</hi> a Jew, converted to the Chriſtian Faith, being ſore troubled for that his Son was turned a Chriſtian, and hearing what the King had done in ſuch like matters, preſented to him 60 Marks of Silver, conditionally, That he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force his Son to return to his Jewiſh Religion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the young man was brought before the King, unto whom he ſaid, <hi>Sirra, thy Father here complaineth, that without his licenſe thou art become a Chriſtian: If this be true, I command thee to return again to the Religion of thy Nation, without any more adoe.</hi> To whom the Young man anſwered, <hi>Your Grace (as I gueſs) doth but jeſt.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the King being moved, ſaid, <hi>VVhat? thou dounghil knave, ſhould I jeſt with thee; Get thee hence quickly, and fulfill my commandement, or by St. Lukes face, I ſhall cauſe thine eyes to be plucked out of thine head.</hi> The Young man nothing abaſhed thereat, with a conſtant voice anſwered, <hi>Truly I will not do it; but know for certain, that if you were a good Chriſtian, you would never have uttered any ſuch words; for it is the part of a Chriſtian, to reduce them again to Chriſt, which are departed from him, and not to ſeparate them from</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:115475:10"/>
               <hi>him, which are joyned to him by Faith.</hi> The King herewith confounded, commanded the Jew to avant and get him out of his ſight: But his Father perceiving, that the King could not perſwade his Son to forſake the Chriſtian Faith, required to have his money again. To whom the King ſaid, He had done ſo much as he promiſed to doe; that was, to perſwade him ſo far as he might. At length, when he would have had the King to have dealt further in the matter; the King (to ſtop his mouth) tendred back to him the one half of his money, and received the other to himſelf. <hi>All which increaſed the ſuspition men had of his Infidelity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this Hiſtory we may perceive what a prevailing Engin the Jews money is, both to ſcrue them into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kingdoms, though the moſt bitter, inveterate, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Enemies of Chriſt himſelf, Chriſtians, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; and how their money can induce even Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes to perpetrate moſt unchriſtian, and antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian actions; and enforce by threats and violence, even converted Chriſtian Jews, to renounce their Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and apoſtatiſe to their former Jewiſh Errors which they had quite renounced. And do not they ſtill work even by the ſelf-ſame Money-Engin? preferred by too many Chriſtians, even before Chriſt himſelf, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity?</p>
            <p>In the year of our Lord, 1145. during the reign of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> the Jews grew ſo preſumptuous in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that they <hi>crucified a child</hi> called <hi>VVilliam,</hi> in the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> in deriſion <hi>of Christian Religion,</hi> as <hi>Matthew VVeſtminſter, Flores Hiſtoriarum,</hi> Ann. 1145. p. 39. <hi>Chronicon Johannis Bromton;</hi> Col. 1048. <hi>Hygden</hi> in his <hi>Polychronicon; Antoninus: Centuriae Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes:</hi> Cent. 12. c. 14.

He is whipped even unto bloud and lividneſſe, crowned with thorns, wearied with ſpittings and ſhrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings: and moreover he is pricked by them all with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards, made to drink gall, derided with reproaches and blaſphemies, and frequently called by them with grinding teeth, <hi>Jeſus the falſe Prophet.</hi> And after rhey had deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in divers manners, they crucified him, and peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him with a ſpear to the heart. And when the child had given up the ghoſt, they took down his body from the croſſe, and took the bowels out of his corps, for what end is unknown, but it was ſaid it was to exerciſe Magical arts. The mother of the child diligently ſought for her abſent ſon for ſome dayes, and it was told her by neighbours, that the laſt time they ſaw her child whom
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115475:20"/>
ſhe ſought, he was playing with the children of the Jews of his age, and entred into the houſe of a certain Jew. Whereupon the woman ſuddenly entred that houſe, and ſaw the body of the child caſt into a certain pit. And having warily called the Baylifs of the City together, the body was found and drawn forth; and there was made a wonderful ſpectacle among the people. But the woman, mother of the child, complaining and crying out, provoked all the Citizens there aſſembled together, to tears &amp; ſighs. There was then preſent at the place <hi>John de Lexinton,</hi> a circumſpect and diſcreet man, and moreover elegantly learned, who ſaid. <hi>We have ſometime heard, that the</hi> Jews <hi>have not feared to attempt ſuch things in reproach of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>our crucified Lord.</hi> And one Jew being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, to wit, he into whoſe houſe the child entred playing, and therefore more ſuſpected than the reſt; he ſaith unto him. <hi>Owretch! knoweſt thou not that ſpeedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction abides thee? All the gold of</hi> England <hi>will not ſuffice for thy deliverance or redemption.</hi> Notwithſtanding I will tell thee, although unworthy, by what means thou maiſt preſerve thy life and members, that thou maiſt not be diſmembred. I will ſave both to thee, if thou doſt not fear to diſcover to me whatſoever things are done in this caſe without falſhood. Whereupon this Jew, whoſe name was <hi>Copin,</hi> believing he had thus found out a way of eſcape, anſwered, ſaying. Sir <hi>John,</hi> if thou makeſt thy words good by thy deeds, I will reveal wonderful things to thee; and the induſtry of Sir <hi>John</hi> animating and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him thereto, the Jew ſaid. <hi>Thoſe things are true which the Christians ſay. The Jews almoſt every year crucify one</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nota.</note> 
               <hi>child, to the injury and contumely of Jeſus; but it is not found out every year: for they do this ſecretly, and in hidden and moſt ſecret places; But this child whom they call</hi> Hugo, <hi>our Jews have moſt unmercifully crucified, and when he was dead, and they deſired to hide him being dead, he could not be buried in the earth, nor hid. For the corps of the innocent was reputed unprofitable for Divination, for he was unbowelled for</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:115475:21"/>
               <hi>that end. And when in the morning it was thought to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, the earth brought it forth, and vomitted it out, and the body ſometimes appeared inhuman, whereupon the Jews ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred it. At laſt it was caſt headlong into a deep pit, neither as yet could it be kept ſecret, For the importunate mother dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſearching all things, at laſt ſhewed to the Baylifs the body ſhe had found.</hi> But Sir <hi>John</hi> notwithſtanding this, kept the Jew bound in chains. When theſe things were known to the Canons of the Church of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted the body to be given to them, which was granted them. And when it had been ſufficiently viewed by an infinite company of people, it was honourably buryed in the Church of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> as the corps of a moſt precious Martyr. The Jews kept the child alive for 10 days, that being fed for ſo many dayes with milk, he might living ſuffer many ſorts of torments. When the K. returned from the Northern parts of <hi>England,</hi> and was certified of the premiſſes, he reprehended Sir <hi>John,</hi> that he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed life and members to ſo flagitious a perſon, which he could not give; for that blaſphemer and homicide was worthy the puniſhment of many ſorts of death. And when as unavoydable Judgement was ready to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon this Offender, he ſaid. <hi>My death is now approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, neither can my Lord</hi> John <hi>preſerve me, who am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to periſh. I now relate the truth to you all. Almoſt all the Jews of</hi> England <hi>conſented to the death of this child, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Jews are accuſed: and almoſt out of every city in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<note place="margin">Nota.</note> 
               <hi>wherein the Jews inhabit, certain choſen perſons were called together to the immolation of that child, as to a Paſchal Sacrifice.</hi> And when as he had ſpoken theſe things, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with other dotages, being tied to an horſes tail, and drawn to the Gallows, he was preſented to the aereal Cacodaemons in body and ſoul; and 91 other Jews, partakers of this wickedneſſe, being carried in Carts to <hi>London,</hi> were there committed to priſon. Who if ſo be they were caſually bewailed by any Chriſtians, yet they were deplored by the <hi>Caurſini</hi> (the Popes <hi>Italian</hi> Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers)
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115475:21"/>
their corrivals with dry eys. Afterwards by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of the Kings Juſtices, it was diſcovered &amp; found; <hi>That the Iews of England by Common Councel had ſlain the innocent Child, puniſhed for many days, and crucified.</hi> But after this the Mother of the ſaid child conſtantly proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her appeal before the King againſt them for that iniquity and ſuch a death; God the Lord of Revenges, rendred them a condigne retribution, according to their merits; for on St. <hi>Clements</hi> day, 88. of the richeſt and greateſt Jews of the City of <hi>London,</hi> were drawn and hanged up in the air upon new Gibbets eſpecially prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for that purpoſe, and more than 23 others were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Tower of <hi>London</hi> to the like judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <hi>Some are of opinion, (and ſo it is ſaid in ſome of our Hiſtories) <hi>That it was enacted by authority of Parliament, that the uſurious Iews ſhould be baniſhed out of rhe Realm:</hi> But the truth is, that their uſury was baniſhed by this Act of Parliament, and that was the cauſe, <hi>that they baniſhed themſelves,</hi> into other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where they might live by their uſury. </hi>So that by his opinion, they were not then baniſhed by the King or Parliament, but only voluntarily baniſhed themſelves upon the making of this Statutes aginſt their Uſury.</p>
            <p>But under the favour of this deceaſed reverend Judge, whoſe memory I generally reverence, this opinion of his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115475:30"/>
is a meer miſtake. For 1. This Statute of Judaiſme was made ſome years before their baniſhment hence, as I formerly hinted, and the laſt clauſe thereof for renting houſes (to continue for 15 years) manifeſts; not in <hi>18E.</hi> 1. 2ly. No Record nor Hiſtorian mentions, that they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily baniſhed themſelves upon the making of this Law, neither can their voluntary departure hence upon this occafion be ſtiled a Baniſhment. 3ly. The forecited Hiſtorians record, that they gave but few years before a vaſt ſum of money to prevent their baniſhment, then urged in Parliament by the Commons, with the profer of the 5 part of their goods to the King for their baniſhment and therefore it is very improbable they would at the ſame time volunntarily baniſh themſelves. 4ly. All the laſt cited Hiſtorians of theſe latter times unanimouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and theywere <hi>judicially, really baniſhed both by the King and Parliament, principally for their infidelity, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fore-alloaged reaſons, commanded under pain of hanging to depart out of it by a ſet day; for the effecting and haſtning whereof, the Commons gave the King a ſifteenth.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not baniſhed by of themſelves alone. Who are more to be credited than this Judges ſingular opinion. 5ly. His own ſubſequent words and Records in direct terms contradict this opinion of his no leſſe than 5 times, which I wonder he obſerved not, I ſhall recite them at large to undeceive his over-credulous Readers of the long Robe, who take his words and works for Oracles (though in many things very full of groſſe miſtakes contradicted by by his own Records, he cites, ſpecially in his Chapter of <note n="*" place="margin">See my Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers levelel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and Plea for the Lords.</note>

            <p>Therefore by theſe 3 records reſolutions cited by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the Jews were all baniſhed by ſentence of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſuch ſort as our Hiſtorians record, and not in his New ſence alone, amounting but to a <hi>Receſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all theſe concurrent Teſtimonies it is apparent [a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sir <hi>Edward Cooks</hi> groundleſſe conceit.]</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all the Jews were then baniſhed out of <hi>England,</hi> never to return again, at the ſpecial inſtance, and requeſt of the Commons in two ſeveral Parliaments, as an intollerable grievance and oppreſſion under which they then groaned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the principle grounds of this their perpetual baniſhment were, their infidelity, Uſury, forgeries of Charters, clipping and falſifying of monies, by which they prejudiced the King and kingdom, and much oppreſſed and impoveriſhed the pople.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That this their baniſhment was ſo acceptable to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115475:31"/>
all the people, who oft-times preſſed it in Parliament, that they gave the King a Fift and Fifteenth part of their moveables, to ſpeed and execute it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That this their baniſhment was by <hi>the unanimous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, Iudgement, Edict, and Decree both of the King and his Parliament; and not by the King alone:</hi> and this Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, total, of them all, and likewiſe final, <hi>Never to return into England.</hi> Which Edict and Decree not now extant in our Parliament Rolls (many of which are loſt) nor prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Statutes; yet it is mentioned by all theſe Authorities.</p>
