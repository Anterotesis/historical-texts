         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT Honorable my

lately to light vpon a Book
dedicated vnto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
by one M. George
Churchey, intituled, A new
booke of good husbandrie, and intreating of
fishponds, and ordering of the same: which
booke, as it should seeme, was first written in
Latine by one Iames Dubrauius, but transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into English by the industrie of the said
Maister Churchey, wherin his good meaning
and trauell is greatly to be commended. I
thereby gathering that your Lordship tooke
some delight in that practise, &amp; being before
that time minded to put in writing certaine
experiments, that my selfe had obserued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
those matters, did presently conclude
<pb facs="tcp:18758:3"/>
with my selfe, humbly to craue that the same
may passe vnder your L. protection: your
vertues also deseruing that I should make
choise herein of your Lordship before others,
as one vnto whom the whole commonweale
of this Realme in general is greatly bounden,
for the great and painfull watchings, care and
trauell you take in administration of Iustice in
your place and calling: and therefore I in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
find my selfe willing (if by any meanes
I may) to moue vnto your Lordship any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
or liking, though neuer so litle. And if
your Lordship haue bene any practiser of
these delights, I meane making of fishponds,
or planting of fruite, I doubt not but you shal
in this litle Treatise, find somewhat that you
knew not before, and thereby your delight
that way augmented, which, if it so happen to
be, my expectation herein is most amplie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied:
Beseeching the Almightie, to blesse,
preserue and keepe you and all yours, with
such felicitie, as your heart desireth.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OOD Reader, in seeking to shun
that Monster Idlenes, and hauing a
desire by all honest meanes possible,
to benefit this my natiue countrie of
England, and finding my abilitie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
insufficient to performe
the same, I haue thought good to set
downe some experiments that my selfe haue had concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
fish and fruite: of which two things, especially of
fruite, although many authors haue more learnedly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
yet many of them being strangers, inhabiting in Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
far differing from ours here in England, doe also
for the most part teach how such fruite as their countries
bring forth are to be vsed, of which kind of fruites here
in England we haue litle or no vse. As also concerning
fish, there are none that haue written in our vulgar tong
to anie purpose that euer I haue seene, sauing that one
Maister Churchey hath procured to be translated into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
a Treatise compiled by a stranger, a Morauian (as
I take it.) Howbeit by reason the translator (as it should
seeme) had no great experience in that matter, he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that shall practise, shall find great want in that booke
to supplie his desires that way. Notwithstanding the good
indeuour of Maister Churchey is greatly to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
neither is my meaning herein to say what may be said
in these matters, but onely what things my selfe haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
and practised. And if I should set downe by way of
<pb facs="tcp:18758:4"/>
preface, the exceeding great benefit that might grow to
this Realme, by practising to haue aboundance of the two
foresaid co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, the preface would grow to a greater
volume then now the whole booke containeth. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I know that many men can say more then my self
can do herein, yet I also beleeue that most men know not so
much: for whose sake I haue compiled this litle trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
by which, if they take either profit or honest pleasure,
I haue my desire. Farewell.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irst it is requisite to speake of
ponds, I meane such as be
necessarie, profitable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
to be vsed with vs
here in England, not such in
which the prodigall Romains
vsed to spend their superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
wealth and treasure, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for vaine ostentation, then for any honest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
of mind, or profite vnto themselues,
or the common wealth: whereunto I wold wish
our countrey people in all their actions to haue
chiefe regard. It should seeme that many of the
Romains imployed incredible wealth in making
of ponds, in which with sea water, they kept di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
kind of sea fish, for delicacie and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
rather then profit: for that such kind of
ponds were onely made neare vnto the sea side,
wheras the like fish might more conueniently be
taken in the sea it selfe. I would rather wish the
greatest store of our ponds to be made farre vp
land in the inmost partes of the Realme, vnto
which places fish cannot well be brought from
the sea, to be eaten fresh whilest it is good, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18758:5"/>
sweete. The ponds I meane to speake of, shall be
of two sorts: the one digged right downe into the
ground by labour of man: the other made with a
head in a valley betweene two hils, by swelling
of the water ouer grassie ground, not in former
times couered with water. Those that are dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
right downe are for the most part but small,
and serue indeed to little vse, vnlesse it be to keepe
fish in for the winter time, to spend as need requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
or to feede fish in: otherwise of themselues
they are not able to sustaine any number of fish, in
any good sort, to increase in grouth or goodnesse
of meate, and therefore I meane not to speake
much of such ponds. But the other kind of pond
made with a head being rightly ordered, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
is mentioned, will giue great nourishment
to fish without any feeding saue of it selfe. It is
therefore requisite for him that would haue good
fish, to haue two such ponds with heads so made,
as with their sluces he may lay them drie when
he pleaseth, and againe to fill them with water
when he shall thinke good, to the end that one of
them may lie drie one yeare, &amp; the other the next
yeare. The greatnesse of his ponds may be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the aptnes of the place where he maketh
them, and to the cost he meaneth to bestow. And
that valley that hath not any sudden descent but
descendeth by little &amp; little, hauing also some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
rill or brooke running through it, is fittest
for this purpose: by reason that in such places a
man shall with least charges in making the head
ouerflow greatest quantitie of ground. The sayd
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18758:5"/>
ponds are to be made as followeth.</p>
               <div type="subpart">
                  <head>The making of a pond for fish.</head>
                  <p>Hauing a place conuenient, <hi>viz.</hi> a valley be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
two hilles, and some small brooke or rill
running through the same, you are to dig a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
or pond as it were from the one hill to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ouerthwart the valley: and with the earth
that you take out of the same to make your head.
Alwayes making your head downe the streame
from the channell, so that the channell shalbe the
deepest place of your pond, and in no wise to dig
any earth, or to make any channell on the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of your head: for that will much weaken
your head. You must also begin the foundation
of your head not hard by the brim of your chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,
but some eight or ten foote from the same,
least the weight of the earth of the head cause
your head to slide into the channell: and raise
your head not vpright, but slopewise for caluing
or slipping downe. And looke how high you
meane to make your head, and so much it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to be in breadth in the top thereof, &amp; three
times that breadth in the bottome: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:
If you meane to make your head ten
foot high, it had need to be ten foot broade in the
top, and thirty foote broade in the bottome, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
it will hardly lye, but calue and slippe
downe againe, vnlesse you force it with timber.
Howbeit such may be the nature of your earth,
as a light sand, or onely chalke, that it will not
stand without timber, otherwise a stiffe clay
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18758:6"/>
mingled with grauell, is best for such a head: if
your soile be a light sand, or altogether a grauell,
or chalke, it will hardly hold water. It is not
good to put any timber in your head to beare it
vp, but rather only earth being broken very smal,
and watered with water often times as you
raise it: for that will cause it to bind closer and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
then any ramming or timber worke will do.
I suppose the Spring time, &amp; Autumne to be best
for the making of such heads, especially if you
water it well and breake the earth small, that it
may drie againe and settle. In the making of
the head,<note place="margin">Where to lay your sluce.</note> you are to lay your sluce in the head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the deepest place of your channell, being
made of a whole peece of timber, or at least wise
the forepart thereof being a whole peece, and the
residue of one or two peeces more, being ioyned
very close, and stopped with haire and tarre in the
ioynts: for if therein be neuer so small a hole, it
will spoyle your head at the sewing of your pond.
Hauing made and hollowed your trough, hewen
through at the tayle, but close at the end next to
the pond, you are to naile thereon a strong boord
or planke, very close in all places: or else which
is better, a slab being before the hollowing of your
trough, sawne from the same: then turne that
side downeward, and then the vpper side will be
that which before was the bottom of the trough:
at the end whereof next to the channell in the
vpper part thereof, you are to make the tampion
hole square, and likewise make a square tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
to shut close in the same, with a steale, either
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18758:6"/>
of the same peece which is best, or else strongly
mortised with a bouetaile mortice into the sayd
tampion, and so reaching vp as high as the top
of your head, or at least to the vppermost part of
the water. And the best fashion for the head of
your sluse, is two strong planks, fastened on each
side of the tampion hole, being in breadth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
broader then the square of your tampion,
&amp; grated boords nailed before &amp; behind the same,
some two or three foote from the bottome. But
for the more speedy sewing out the water, you
may make as it were a nose of grated boords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the tampion, at the bottome of the sluce, of
some three or foure foote long, and a foote deepe.
The residue of the sluce may be boorded vp to the
top with boords vngrated, and I thinke grated
boords to be better for this purpose, being made
with a hand saw, rather then holes made with
piercer or augur. The trough of this sluce had
need be layd so soone as you begin to make your
head, because it may conuey the water from you,
which else will trouble you in making the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell.</p>
                  <p>The sluce made, and the channell digged, it
may be you shall need more earth to be carried in
dung-carts or barrowes which you are still to
keepe mingled with water, and the earth broken
smal: in frostie weather it is good working of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such head. Also take heede you put not in the
sayd head, any dung or turfs of grasse, that will
turne to dung: but onely good earth. When the
head is raised, it is requisite to settle well before
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18758:7"/>
you fill the same with water, and therefore not
good to fill it full the first yeare, but rather halfe
full: and to store it with such fish as you meane
to keepe therein,<note place="margin">When to store your ponds.</note> in Ianuary, February or
March: after which time it is not good to carry
or handle any fish all the sommer time, vntill
it be October or Nouember. The colder the
weather is when you handle your fish, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
vnlesse it be for such fish as you meane to
spend presently.<note place="margin">Not good to handle fish in hot wea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther.</note> But store-fish being taken or
handled in hot weather, will be sicke, and not
prosper long time after, and perhaps die thereof,
although not presently.</p>
                  <p>And to speake of fish, I meane such as are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
kept in ponds or lakes, I will deuide them
into two sorts: those that liue by rauening and
deuouring of other fish, and the others that
liue vpon seedes, roots, weeds, corne, wormes,
and such like: for as there are some beasts that
do liue chiefly and naturally by flesh of other
beasts, and other some that liue onely by corne,
grasse, fruit, &amp; such like, &amp; will at no time taste of
flesh:<note place="margin">Rauening fish.</note> so there are fishes much like in nature. The
fish that liue vpon rauening and deuouring of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fish, are the Pike, the Trought, the Perch,
&amp; the Eele: and these kinds will not natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feede vpon corne, rootes, seeds, grasse, or such
like.<note place="margin">Fish not of the raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning kind.</note> But the Carpe, the Breame, the Tench,
and the Roch, liue naturally vpon corne, seedes,
grasse, wormes, bodes, flies, and such like: &amp; will
not naturally feede vpon any other fish, neither
hath nature giuen them meanes so to do, for that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18758:7"/>
the foresayd deuouring fish haue only dog-teeth,
or sharpe teeth, wherewith they bite and hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other fish that they take: and when that by
griping and biting it, they feele it dead, and cease
to struggle or striue, then they swallow it downe
whole. The other kind do not so: but hauing
teeth only like vnto man, broade and flat do grind
and chew all their meate before they swallow it:
and it is as vnnaturall for the Carpe, Breame,
Tench or Roch to eate another raw fish, as it is
for a sheep or a cow to eate raw flesh. The sharpe
and deuouring teeth in the Pike, Perch,
Trought &amp; Eele, are easily seene and perceiued,
but so are not the flat grinding teeth in the other
kind of fish. Howbeit if you search diligently the
head of the Carpe, Breame, or any the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresayd
of that nature, &amp; of any bignesse, when
it is sodden you shall find two neather iawes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
in each iaw a row of flat teeth, like to the
eye teeth in a man, &amp; apt to grind &amp; chew withall,
with which two neather iawes they grind their
meate against a certaine flat bone in the roofe of
their mouth, or vpper part of their throte, which
is commonly called the stone in the Carpes head,
and is in steede of his vpper iaw and teeth, and of
many thought to be a remedy for excessiue blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at the nose for man. The like is in the head
of the Tench and Roch, although by reason of
the smalnesse it is not easie to be found. Of the
same nature also is the Barbill, Cheuen, Dace,
Bleke, and riuer Roch: although I haue not
seene them vsually in any pond. Howbeit they wil
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18758:8"/>
liue and wex in a pond, especially the riuer Roch,
but not spawne, vnlesse it haue great store of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea
running through it continually, neither will
the Trought spawne in any standing poole, but
will liue and grow very fat and good, if the pond
be of any greatnesse, as some fiue or sixe acres
of ground, or more, and that he may haue good
store of small fry to feede on, and will also be
very fat and good all the winter long, by reason
he doth not spawne as aforesayd.</p>
                  <p>The best fish in my opinion is Carpe,
Breame, Tench, and Perch: howbeit if your
pond be not aboue foure or fiue acres of ground,
a Breame will be fiue or sixe yeares at the least,<note place="margin">A Breame long in growing, and a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaser.</note>
before it be of any bignesse to eate, as also they
will ouer-store any pond with fry, which is a
great hinderance to the growth of your bigger
fish. Hauing stored your pond, as aforesayd, you
shall find that the first yeare your fish will spawne
exceedingly.<note place="margin">The first yeare your fish will spawne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly.</note> Howbeit if any water run through
your pond, your fry will very hardly be kept in:
for that all the beginning of the sommer they

end of the sommer they will go away with
the streame,<note place="margin">The nature of fish.</note> if they be not with very good grates
kept in, and herein you are to vse very great
diligence. And therefore your pond being full
of water, it is good to conuey away the residue in
some ditch, along hard by the one side of your
pond, casting the banke of your ditch toward the
pond: the leuel of the water will direct you
where to make your ditch: so may your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey

and such as you meane to spend that winter,
to put into small ponds, or stewes, whereas
with a dragge you may take them againe as
you neede to spend them: the other store-fish
you may put into the like pond, as aforesayd,
either new made, or one that hath lien dry all

great number of frie, especially of Breame, it
were better to preserue but part of them, and
the residue to put into some stew or small pond
with Pikes:<note place="margin">To feede Pikes with your superfluous fry.</note> so shall you alwayes haue
good Pikes, and also your Carpe, Breame,

ponds be not ouerstored with fry, your pond
being sewed, and your fish bestowed, it is good
to let that pond you last sewed, to lie as drie as
you can by any meanes all that winter, and
the next sommer vntill Michelmas: and then
to fill it with water of the first floud that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
about that time: and sew your other
pond betweene Michelmas and Hollantide,
vsing the same as is before rehearsed. As for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18758:9"/>
hauing any fish to spend in the Sommer time,
it is requisite to trust to your angle, a bownet,
a tramell, or such like: by which meanes
you shall seldome faile of some fish for your
spending. If you should keepe any Carpe,
Breame, or Tench in stewes in the Sommer
time, they will wex leane, vnlesse you do feede
them with corne: as barly, sod pease, or oates,
or any other kind of corne. It may be heare
expected I should set downe some proportion
of number of fishes, hauing regard to the
greatnesse of your pond, and the greatnesse of
the fish. Surely as the fertility of some soyle
will nourish double the number of cattle that
some others will do, euen so of pondes: if the
soyle bee a fat clay, or other good ground, it
will nourish double the number of fish, that
a leane barren heath ground or drie sand will
do. Howbeit the ordering of a pond in such
sort as aforesayd, and to lie dry euery other
yeare, will much mend any ground euery yeare,
especially if in the Sommer time when it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
dry, cattell, and especially sheepe may
feede and lie therein, as hereafter shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by good reason. Howbeit in an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
soile, I suppose you may well keepe foure
hundreth Carpe,<note place="margin">The propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fish according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your pond.</note> Breame, or Tench, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
acre, supposing your fish to be eight or ten
inches in length: and the greater your pond is,
the greater number in proportion it will keepe:
as for example: a pond of foure acres will
much better keepe 1600. fish, then a pond of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18758:9"/>
two acres will keepe eight hundreth of like
fish: for euery hundreth of such fish as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd,
you may keepe halfe a hundreth Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the same pond, after you are once suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
stored of frie, and not before: for that
a Perch is a very great deuourer of frie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
of Carpe. I haue seene in the belly
of a small Perch sixteene or seuenteene small
Carpe frie at once: but hauing sufficient of
frie, they do good in a pond, rather then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise:
and will themselues be very fat and
good. The Pike is in no wise to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into your great ponds, with your other
fish, he is so great a deuourer, and will grow
so fast hauing his fill of feeding, that being
but eight or ten inches in the beginning of
Sommer, he may be eighteene or twentie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
before Hollantide, at what time he will
eate more fish euery day, then will suffise a man,
and will feede onelie of Carpe before anie other
fish, if there be Carpe frie in the pond. Howbeit
hauing two such ponds as aforesaid, made with
heads, you shall euerie yeare haue sufficient
store of reffuse frie, to feede some good number
of Pikes withall, wherewith they will be made
verie thicke, sweete, and well growne, but not
fatte, vnlesse you haue some store of small
Eeles, wherewithall to feede them some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
or sixe weekes before you take them to
spend: for that only that feeding vpon Eeles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cut in peeces, so as they may stir in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and yet not be able to escape awaie, will
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18758:10"/>
make the Pikes verie fat.</p>
                  <p>The causes mouing to haue a pond lie but one
yeare with water and fish,<note place="margin">Causes why ponds shold lie drie eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other yeare.</note> and the next yeare
emptie and drie, do hereafter ensue. First
by that meanes you shall auoide superfluous
number of frie, which greatly hinder the growth
and goodnesse of your greater fish. Secondly,
by that meanes you shall so proportion your
pond, that it shall neuer be ouerstored. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by that meanes your water shall alwayes
be excellent sweete, by reason it ouerfloweth
such ground as hath taken the sunne and ayre
all the sommer before: wherein also if cattell do
feede, or especially be fodered and lie, their
dung and stale together with the naturall
force of the Sunne at the next Spring ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
with water, will breede an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
number of flies, and bodes of diuerse
kinds and sorts, which in a faire sunshine day
in March or Aprill, you shall see in the water as
thicke as motes in the Sunne, of which
bodes and flies the fish do feede exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Also great store of seedes, of weedes,
and grasse, shedding that sommer that it lieth
drie, is a great feede to your fish the next
Sommer after, when it is ouerflowne with
water. The sayd bodes doe for the most
part breede of the blowings and seede of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
kinds of flies, and such like liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in the sommer, when your pond lieth drie,
in the dung of cattell, and otherwise: and
take life and being the ne<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t Spring time
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18758:10"/>
by the naturall heate of the Suune, together
with the moisture of the fat and pleasant
water, as aforeiaid: for surely many and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
kinds of flies that flie about in the ayre
in Sommer time, do take life in the water o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflowing
such ground where they haue bene
left by the blowings and feede of other flies.
And I haue often obserued and beheld in a
sunshine day, in shallow waters, especially
where any dung or fatte earth is therewith
mingled: I say, I haue seene a young flie
swimme in the water too and fro, and in
the end come to the vpper crust of the water,
and assay to flie vp: howbeit not being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly
ripe or fledge, hath twice or thrice fallen
downe againe into the water: howbeit in
the end receiuing perfection by the heate of
the sunne, and the pleasant fat water, hath
in the ende within some halfe houre after ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
her flight, and flied quite awaie into
the ayre. And of such young flies before
they are able to flie awaie, do fish feede excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
Fourthlie, your fish shall euerie yeare
haue feeding in proportion to their increasing
in bignesse: for it standeth with reason, that
Carpes or other fish of twelue inches long,
will require more feeding then so many of
si<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e inches long will do: but chieflie by meanes
aforesayd of sewing euerie yeare,<note place="margin">What ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth sweete fish.</note> you shall
haue oportunitie to be rid of the great increase
of frie, and your greater fish more sweete and fat
then any other hath by farre.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:18758:11"/>
Fish will liue in a manner in any pond, and
without any feeding, or such other industrie
as aforesayd: but then they are forced to liue
vppon the muddie earth and weedes that
grow in such ponds, and being so fedde, they
will eate and taste accordingly: and there is
as great difference in taste betweene fish that is
kept as aforesaid,<note place="margin">Great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in goodnesse of pond fish.</note> and other fish that is kept
in a standing pond without feeding or other
industrie, as is betweene the flesh of a Larke,
and the flesh of a Crow or Kite. And I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that that is the cause that most men
are out of loue with all pond fish, because they
neuer tasted of any good or well ordered pond
fish.</p>
                  <p>That Sommer that your pond lieth drie,
as aforesaid, if there happen to grow any
sower or rancke weedes therein (as many
times there will) it is good to cut them vp,
and being dried with the sunne, to burne them,
so shall you haue sweete grasse, or yong weeds
come in their place, that cattell will feede
on, and also the heate of the sunne shall much
amend your ground. Also trench out the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that it may lie as drie as may be possible:
and if you can plough it, and haue Sommer
corne therein, as bucke or barley that Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
that it lieth drie, I thinke it very good.</p>
                  <p>I haue heard the common people in the
fenne countries affirme, and that very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
that their fishes do feede of ashes, by
reason that in a drie Sommer, when much of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18758:11"/>
their fenne grounds lie drie, and are pastured
with cattell, then towards the winter time
such ranke grasse, sedge, reedes, or weedes,
as the cattell do leaue vneaten, they will
burne them with fire, to the end that the next
Sommer such old sedge, reedes, or weedes, may
not annoy the comming vp of young and better
sedge, reedes, or grasse. And the common
people find by experience, that after such
a drie Sommer, as aforesaid, all the next Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the water ouerflowing those grounds,
their fish will be exceeding fat and good: and
therefore (say they) surely the fish do feede vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the ashes of the weeds, and such like burnt
as aforesaid. But the truth is, in such a drie
Sommer as aforesaid, the cattell then fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in such grounds as then lie drie, do
bestow therein great quantitie of dung and
stale, wherein is bred great abundance of
such bodes, flies, and wormes, as aforesayd:
as also the naturall and liuelie heate of the
Sunne piercing such grounds, doth make the
same pleasant and fat, and to bring forth the
next Sommer many hearbes and weedes,
the seedes of which do yeeld vnto fishes verie
great foode and nourishment, and not the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
drie ashes, as afore is imagined.</p>
                  <p>He that cannot haue such ponds as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,<note place="margin">The second sort of ponds.</note>
and hauing but some small mote or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
horse-pond in his ground, that standeth
continuallie full of water, may often times
haue a dish of good fish, if he will bestow some
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18758:12"/>
feeding of corne,<note place="margin">How fish may be fed in such ponds.</note> as sod barley or pease, cheese-curds,
or bloud of beasts, to throw into his
pond in the sommer time, for that fish being
not of the rauening kind, do then onelie feede.
But it behoueth to do it in such sort, as he may
be assured that the fish do eate it, and that he
be not beguiled with duckes, geesse, or such like.
He may therefore make a square thing of some
two foote broade, of Elme boords, with
ledges some three or foure inches deepe, and
therein sincke his corne with a line tied vnto
the foure corners thereof, so that he may pull
it vp and let it downe when he pleaseth, and
after the fish haue once found the vse thereof,
you shall well perceiue they will haunt it. Sweet
graines in small proportion are also good, but
if they be once sower or mustie, the fish will not
feede on them, and also they will stench your
pond.<note place="margin">The Tench good to be fed.</note> The Tench of all other fish will best like
to be fed, as aforesaid, and will be very good,

                  <p>It is with fish as it is with other creatures,
for like as one acre of ground, will hardly
feede one ore throughout the yeare, to keepe
him in good plight and fat, yet so much corne
or hay you may lay in that acre, that you may
feede therein ten or twentie oxen. And euen
so, although one acre of ground ouerflowed
with water, will naturallie, and if it selfe keepe
but 300. or foure hundreth Carpes, or other
fsshes: yet so much feeding you may adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18758:12"/>
that it may keepe three thousand or foure
thousand in as good plight as three hundreth

creatures fish are the greatest increasers in
number: and so great is the increase of them,
that I do verily suppose the Sea it selfe and
all fresh riuers likewise, would be ouerstored
if they did not deuour one another in very great
quantity: yet haue they many other enemies
besides fish, that do continually pray and feede
vpon them: as, for pond fish, first the small Eeles,
when the Carps, Breams, Tenches, or Roches
do lay their spawne in egges in spawning time,
you shall many times see sixe,<note place="margin">Eeles and afterward Perches great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourers of frie.</note> ten, or more small
Eeles follow them, and as the spawne falleth
from them they eate it, as also Duckes will do
the like. Afterward so sonne as it is quicke, the
Eele, and especially the Perch, will deuour it in
great quantitie before it be able to swimme any
thing fast. After that, it is foode for the Kings
fisher,<note place="margin">Fish haue many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them.</note> all kind of shel-foule, the Bitture, the
Hearne, the Cormorant, and the Ospray. And
when it is at the greatest, as if it bee a Carpe
of three foote long, the Otter will kill him: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
all ponds would quickly be ouerstored,
if it also go not away with flouds, which is
greatly to be foreseene. I remember myselfe did
once put three spawning Carps into a pond that
was some three acres of ground, and with them
nine or ten milters about February, and in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember
next following I did sew the same pond,
and of those breeders I had 9000. and vpwards
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18758:13"/>
of Carpe frie, notwithstanding all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
enemies: and surely a Breame will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in number much more.<note place="margin">How fish do breede.</note> The ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
and breeding of the like fish as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
I haue noted to be in this manner, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
in May, and sometime in Iune, as the
season happeneth to fall out apt for genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the water by Gods prouidence hauing
then a naturall warmth to performe the
same, the male fish by course of nature, will
chase about the female, seeking copulation:
and as in all other creatures, so in this the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
seemeth to shun and flie from the male,
so that you shall see three, foure, or fiue male
fish chase one female, and so hold her in on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
side, that they will force her to swimme
through weedes, grasse, rushes, straw, or any
such like thing that is in the pond, wherein
she being intangled and wearied with their
chasing, they find oportunitie to ioyne in copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
with her, mingling their milt with her
spawne, sometime one of them, sometime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
at which time the spawne falleth from
her like little egges, and sticketh fast to the
sayd weedes: some eight, nine, or ten dayes
after which time it quickneth, taketh life,
and hath the proportion of a fish: yea two or
three dayes before it quicken, if you take such
an egge and breake it vppon your naile, you
shall perceiue the proportion of a fish therein.
After it is quicke it mooueth very little for
some fortnight or three weekes, and then it
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18758:13"/>
gathereth together into sculles by the shore side,
where the water is shallow: howbeit the
Tench frie will lie scattering in the weedes, and
not flote in sculles.</p>
                  <p>And if there run any water from your pond,
you shall not possible keepe Eeles out of the
same, they will come into the same against
the streame. Their manner of breeding is
very vncertaine and vnknowne,<note place="margin">The bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Eeles very vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and vnknowne.</note> but vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they are bred in the brackish or sea water:

to come into all great riuers, and out of
great riuers into lesser riuers, and out of those
lesser riuers into all small brookes, rils, and
running waters, continually against the
streame all the beginning of Sommer: as
likewise with the first floud that commeth
about Michelmas, they couet to go downe
the streame, and will not stay vntill they come
into the deepe and brackish waters, if they be
not taken or letted by the way. I know that
some hold opinion that they breede of the
May deaw, for proofe whereof they say if you
cut vp two turfes of grassie in a May mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and clap the grassie sides of those turfes
together, and so lay them in a riuer, you shall
the next day find small young Eeles betweene
the sayd turfes: and so you shall indeeede,
for the most part do. Howbeit not therefore
they do breede of the deaw, for if you likewise
take a little bottle of sweete hay, straw, or
weedes, that haue had no May deaw fallen
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18758:14"/>
thereon, and sinke it in a riuer at that time of
the yeare, and take it out suddenly the next

small Eeles therein. The reason is, at that

young Eeles, they will creepe into euery thing
that is sweete and pleasant.<note place="margin">Eeles come from the brackish and sea wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> And for proofe

Barbils, Troutes, Roch, Date,
Cheuin, Gogions, and other riuer fish at
Weres and Dammes in great riuers, for that
they couet to spawne in shallow waters, and
not in the deepe: the which thing when they
haue performed,<note place="margin">Fish couet to go downe the streame in the latter end of the Sommer.</note> they then presently couet to
go downe the streame vntill they come vnto the
brackish or sea water.</p>
                  <p>It may be here expected that I should set
downe the baites to be vsed for all kind of
pond-fish,<note place="margin">Baites for euery seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fish.</note> for all seasons of the yeare, but therein
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18758:14"/>
I haue not had such exact knowledge to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
vnto the diligent practiser any better
then himselfe can find out. I haue found that
the Carpe, Breame, and Tench, being vsed
to feeding, will bite at the red worme, paste
made of dough, or the grashopper, most part
of the Sommer season. The Tench also is
a fish very easilie taken in a Bownet, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
hath of them in his ponds, it behooueth
him to take great heede that he be not deceiued
by leud people.</p>
                  <p>The shallow or pond Roch with the red fins
will spawne in most ponds. The riuer Roch
and Dace will not spawne in any pond: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
if your pond be neare any riuer, and that
there runne any water from it in the Sommer
time, you shall find that they will come into the
same against the streame, where you would
thinke it vnpossible: and so will Pickerell and
Perch. And I haue heard some affirme very
constantly, that water-fowle do often times
bring the spawne of such fish in their feathers
into ponds.<note place="margin">Many opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning breeding of fish.</note> Others will affirme, that the heate
of the Sunne may draw vp such spawne of fish
before it be quicke, and so the same taking life
in the moist ayre, may afterward fall downe in a
shower of raine into a pond: the reason that hath
mooued many men so to thinke, is, because they
haue found such kind of fish in their ponds, where
they are sure that they nor any other haue euer
put any such. Howbeit surely the same haue
come into the sayd ponds against the streame, as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18758:15"/>
aforesaid, in Sommer flouds, and not by any
such other monstrous generation as is last a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned. And somewhat to say of the
growth of fish: as nature may be helped by
art in other things, so likewise in fish very
much: for that a Carpe may with feeding the
first yeare be brought to be sixe inches long,
and the next to twelue or foureteene inches,
whereas in ordinary ponds without feeding,
they will hardly be brought to be fourteene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in fiue or sixe yeares.</p>
                  <p>I do not thinke that ground would yeeld vnto
the owner any other way so much benefite, as
to be conuerted into such ponds with heads
as is afore mentioned, if onely fish were spent
vppon the dayes by law ordained for that
purpose in this Realme: the which thing if
it were obserued, no doubt would turne this
Realme to incredible benefite, many and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
wayes. But now those that should spend
such fish, will rather bestow their money in
Rabbets, Capons, or such like. Howbeit
I am perswaded that fish vsed as aforesayd,
and dressed whilest it is new taken, is very
wholsome for mans body, and also more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
then most kinds of flesh.</p>
                  <p>A Breame will be very long in growing,
before it come to any bignesse,<note place="margin">A Breame very slow in growth.</note> as commonly
fiue or sixe yeares before he be a foote long, but
if your water be not very great, he will hardly be
a foote long in ten yeares.</p>
                  <p>The Tench will grow and prosper very well:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18758:15"/>
howbeit will neuer be so great as some Carpes
will be.</p>
                  <p>I haue seene a Carpe of xxxiii.<note place="margin">Carpe.</note> inches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the eye and the forke of the taile, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
any Tench aboue two and twenty inches
of like measure.</p>
                  <p>The Pike will grow exceedingly, if he may
haue his fill of other small fish: as, the first yeare
to twelue or fourteene inches, the next to twenty
or two and twenty inches.</p>
                  <p>And whosoeuer hath ponds with heads as
aforesayd, shall euery yeare very conueniently
feede some good number of Pikes in some ditch
or small stew with refuse frie.</p>
                  <p>If you haue such ponds as aforesayd, often
or twelue acres of ground or more, neare any
riuer where Troughts are,<note place="margin">Troughts may be kept in ponds.</note> you may get
Troughts to put into such ponds with your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fish, so there be no Pikes amongst them.
Howbeit when you come to sew your pond,
and that the water commeth any thing neare
the mud, your Troughts will then die: yet
haue I seene them grow exceedingly in such a
pond in one yeare, and to be very fat and good:
howbeit they must be very charily handled in
the cariage, and a few of them caried in a great
deale of faire and cleane water, and that in
cold weather, and may not be handled with
hands, but in a hand-net very charily: and so
likewise are all other fish to be vsed, especially
such as you meane to keepe for store.</p>
                  <p>If you haue Carpes in small ditches, in the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18758:16"/>
moneth of March, at what time Todes doe
ingender, the Tode will many times co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet
to fasten himselfe vppon the head of the
Carpe, and will thereby inuenime the Carpe,
in such sort that the Carpe will swell as great
as he may hold, so that his seales will stand as
it were on edge, and his eyes stand out of his
head neare halfe an inch, in very vgly sort: and
in the end will for the most part die thereof:
and it is very dangerous for any person to eate
of any such Carpe so inuenimed.</p>
                  <p>It is not sufficient that fish be aliue and
swimme away when they are put into a pond,<note place="margin">Fish to be charily handled in the cariage.</note>
but if they be brused or take heate in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
they will be long before they recouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
and fall to their feeding, and sometime
neuer recouer, but after long pining and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
do in the end die also.</p>
                  <p>The Carpe of all pond fish will abide most
hardnesse in cariage:<note place="margin">The Carpe will abide most hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> next to him the Tench,
then the Breame, Pike, and Perch. A Carpe
in the winter time may be caried aliue in wet

or sixe houres.</p>
                  <p>If you cary any fish in water, let not the Tench
or Eele be caried among them,<note place="margin">Tenches and Eeles not to be caried with other fish.</note> because they
cast great store of slime, which will choke and

                  <p>A Pike will hardly feede of any thing except
it stirre and be aliue, but the Perch and Eele
will feede of the small guts of sheepe being cut,
or of any garbage of Chickens, Coneys, or such
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18758:16"/>
like, and of bloud of beasts.</p>
                  <p>The Tench, Perch, and Eele, being vsed to
be fed, will not lightly faile to bite at an angle
anytime the Sommer halfe yeare.</p>
                  <p>The feeding of frie the first yeare will make
them quickly past many dangers, as of being
past danger of eating of some other fishes and
foules, as also past danger of going away at
grates, or at the holes of water rats in
bankes. Also they will be of a larger and greater
growth then euer they will be not being fed:
and it behooueth to feede them with such foode
as they are able to feede on: as, the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
with otemeale, or some other meale sod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and being cold may be like a gelly in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
a very little in quantity to be laid in shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
places, where onely the frie do haunt,
and not the greater fish. A Carpe frie will
begin to feede when he is not aboue an inch long,
at what time also they will begin to gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in sculles after some fortnight or three
weekes, you may then make their meate thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
and increase in quantitie as your frie bee
of abilitie to eate it, giuing to euerie kind of frie
such feeding as his nature requireth.</p>
                  <p>It is not good to handle any kinde of frie
whilest it is very young and tender, or at
least wise not in handes, but in some small
mashed hand-net, that is flatte and not
deepe like a bagge or a sacke, and a few at
once, that they rub not one vpon another.</p>
                  <p>The second yeare you may feede your frie
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18758:17"/>
with sodden barley or mault steeped in water,
and the third yeare with sodden pease: for
like as any kind of beasts, especially such as
chew not the cud, do take more nutriture out
of sodden corne, then out of corne being raw:
so fishes being of nature more cold then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures, take lesse nutriture of raw
corne then any other creatures do. And if you
feede your fish with raw corne, you shall find it
come from them in their dung not halfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted,
whereby a great part of the feeding
thereof is lost and doth not good. It may be
demaunded if it will quite the cost, to haue fish
in this sort fed. Surely if corne be not excessiue
deare, it will beare the charges very well: for
that a small quantity of corne will suffice a
great many of fish. Howbeit the other way
before mentioned, with ponds with heads,
and to lie drie euery other yeare, is lesse trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
and will breede very excellent, good,
sweete, and fat fish: so that they bee not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerstored,
although they haue no feeding by
hand.</p>
                  <p>The more that a pond lieth open vnto the
Sunne, the ayre, and the winds, the better it
is for your fish.</p>
                  <p>The leaues of any kind of trees, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of oke, falling into any pond, is noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

                  </p>
                  <p>The haunt of cattell vnto any pond is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18758:17"/>
good, and nourishing to the fish, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of kine and oxen, and chiefly when such cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
do feede where corne hath bene newly
mown or reaped, for that therewil then remaine
in their dung much corne and seedes of grasse,
which the fishes being not of the rauening kind
do feede on.</p>
                  <p>The fish that bee not of the rauening kind,
do feede little or nothing in the winter time,
but do lie either in holes in the bankes, or in
weedes in the bottome of the ponds, to shun
the extremitie of cold ayre.</p>
                  <p>The rauening kind do feede in the winter
season, although nothing so much as in the
Sommer season.</p>
                  <p>Some will hold opinion that the Pike
will not eate the Perch, because of his sharpe
finnes, but I haue often times seene two or
three small Perches in the belly of a Pike,
and likewise in the belly of an Eele. And I
haue likewise seene a Pike choked sometime
with eating of a Perch, when as he hath swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Perch with the taile foremost.</p>
                  <p>But the Pike will not lightly meddle with
the Perch if there be any store of other kind
of feeding for him in the pond of other small
fish.</p>
                  <p>It is also requisite that the Pike be helped, so
that he labour not ouer much in chasing of his
pray before he take it, as to haue the tailes of
the small fish cut off, when you throw them into
the stew or small pond vnto your Pikes, to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18758:18"/>
end they may with the more ease take them,
The Perch and Eele will feed of bloud of beasts
as aforesayd, and likewise of the small garbage
of sheepe and such like being cut small, and
also of small frie of fish, either
dead or aliue.</p>

common-wealth through the
abundance of fruite were well
weighed and pondered, there
would be lawes established for
the increase and maintenance
therof throughout this Realme.
Many countries as Gloccster-shire, Hereford-shire,
Worcester-shire, great part of Kent and Sussex are
so replenished with fruite, that it serueth the poorer
sort not onely for foode a great part of the yeare, but
also for drinke the most part of the yeare. I haue
knowne in those countries many men that haue 12. or
twenty persons vprising and downe lying in their
houses, that do not spend most yeares two quarters
of malt for their drinke (but onely cider and perry)
and also do yearely sell great quantitie. And there is
no doubt but in most countries in England there
might be the like, if men would generally plant fruite,
and notwithstanding take as great commoditie in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
by pasturing or earing of their ground as they
now do. But in many places the short estate that
men haue in their holdings, and the discommoditie
they find in stealers, do discourage them. Howbeit
if men would generally plant in their hedge-rowes,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18758:19"/>
balkes and other places, it would be a very small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to any one man, although poore folke did now &amp;
then take some part of the same. Howbeit it were very
necessary that some law were established to punish
such offenders, not so much in respect of the value of
the thing, as in that it discourageth men to set &amp; plant
fruite, and that respect were had to <hi>Moses</hi> Law, <hi>viz.</hi>
that so long as the same extendeth but to the filling
of their bellies to expell hunger, it is the more to be
borne withall: but if they shall also cary away to any
value, there is no reason but that it should be seuerely
punished. I am also perswaded that cider and perry
is very wholesome for the bodies of naturall English
people, especially such as do labor and trauell. It is
also by experience found to be very good to furnish
ships withall for long voyages by sea, for that a small
quantity thereof will relish and giue good taste vnto
a great deale of water: and very great commodity
might arise to this Realme, if we were able to spare
mault to serue the Low countries withall, or rather
the same being made into beare, for that our Themes
water doth for that purpose passe any other water
whatsoeuer: which thing in time might be very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
vnto our Prince in respect of custom, &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to the whole Realme, in respect of maintenance
of Nauigation by transporting the same, besides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR planting of any great

first to sow in some bed
(being before hand well tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
two foote deepe,<note place="margin">A nurcery of plants and grafts.</note> and the
earth broken small and layd
light but not dunged) the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
of apples, crabs, or pears.
The kernels of apples may be gotten in some
good quantitie of such as make apple pies to sell
in markets or market townes. The keruels of
crabs or peares, are to be picked out of crabs
that are stamped for veriuyce, or peares ground
or stamped for perry: which kernels being
sowne in such beds as aforesayd, being kept from
cropping of cattell or Coneys, and also kept with
weeding, will in two yeares be ready to remoue
and to be set in beds three foote asunder one
way, and a foote the other other way, the body
being cut off halfe a foote aboue the ground, in
which beds hauing stood one yeare, they may
then be grafted with what fruite you please,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18758:20"/>
a handfull aboue the ground is best grafting,
which beds being kept with weeding, you may
also commodiously plant strawberies vnder your
grafts. Within three or foure yeares after the
grafting, they will be ready to remoue into an
Orchard, where you may plant them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue:
but if you meane to plant them in your
hedge-rowes in your ground where cattle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
they had need to be of sixe yeares growth
after the grafting, because you may then the
more conueniently tie bushes about them, or
other prouision to keepe them from cattle: but
the wild choke peare that is neuer grafted, will
make very good perry.</p>
               <p>Also one other way to plant an Orchard
may be done by planting of small crab-stockes
in beds in some nurcery as aforesayd, three foote
asunder one way, and one foote the other way,
the ground in the sayd beds being first trenched
two foote deepe, and the mould laid light, and
the stocke cut off halfe a foote aboue ground:
and the next yeare the same to be grafted close
by the ground, or at the most foure inches aboue
the ground, to the end that if the first grafting
happen to faile, it may be againe grafted the
second time. Howbeit some also do vse to graft
fiue or sixe foote high, and vppon great olde
stockes, the same is not greatly amisse: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the other way is farre better as I take it, for
that the siences so grafted fiue or sixe foote high,
are many times broken downe with foules ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on them, &amp; many times broken downe with
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18758:20"/>
the wind in the ioynt when they are 3. or 4. years
old, which is a great displeasure vnto the owner.</p>
               <p>Aboue all things you must foresee,<note place="margin">An especiall note to be obserued.</note> that the
ground of your nurcerie or orchard be not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ouer wet or moist. It cannot lightly be too
drie, for that the rootes will naturally run down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
vntill they come vnto sufficient moisture:
but if the roote of anie plant be once set too deepe,
he cannot helpe himselfe: it is against nature for
the roote to grow vpwards, but will rather grow
mustie and die.</p>
               <p>The third way to plant an Orchard, is by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of slips of trees of cider fruite, which is the
speediest &amp; readiest way in shortest time to haue
store of such fruite. But that kind of setting doth
seldome prosper but onely in some few especiall
kind of cider fruite. As also an Orchard so plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
will not continue aboue fortie, or at the most
fiftie yeares, but it will decay againe.</p>
               <p>In planting of an Orchard the greatest care
is to be had,<note place="margin">Wet grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds vnfit for an Orchard.</note> that the ground be not too wet: for
that a tree planted in such ground cannot pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
or if it grow, it will not beare other then
spotted and cappard fruite, either apple, peare or
plumme, neither will it shoote out or grow in anie
good sort. If your ground be naturally wet, it
must be holpen with making of trenches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
euerie row of trees, so as the water may
draine away, at the least three foote deepe: and
whereas the ground is inclined to moisture, you
are to set your trees verie shallow, as halfe a foot
deepe, and rather to raise a hillock of earth about
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18758:21"/>
your tree roote, then to set your tree too deepe
near the water.<note place="margin">An especiall matter to be noted in planting of any trees whatsoeuer.</note> And here note, that euery ground
hath an vpper crust of earth, which by the natural
heate of the Sun, &amp; pleasantnesse of the ayre pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the same, is made more fruitfull then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue
of the earth is: which vpper crust in some
grounds is a foote, some two foote, and in some
three foote deepe: also in some grounds not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
halfe a foote deepe. And vnder the same
vpper crust is either a hote chalke, a drie sand, a
barren grauell, or a cold lean clay, or lome, or such
like. It is therefore requisite that you set your
yong tree in such sort, as that the rootes thereof
may run and spread in that vpper crust, for that if
you set him any deeper, you spoile all.</p>
               <p>In many places in a chalke ground, where
such crust as aforesayd is very shallow and not
past halfe a foote deepe, you shall see most of the
rootes of the Elmes Ashes, and other trees
there growing, to runne naturally euen three or
foure inches aboue the earth: which thing they
do to shun the extreame heate of the chalke. The
like experience shall you also see in a wet or moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
ground, a great part of the roote of great
trees to run also aboue the ground, for that they
do naturally shunne the extreame wet and cold of
such grounds.</p>
               <p>The fattest &amp; fruitfullest ground is not best for
fruite, for that the trees growing in such ground
will be very subiect to be eaten with cankers, as
also the fruite will be much wormeaten.</p>
               <p>I suppose the best ground for an Orchard is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18758:21"/>
a wheate ground, or that which is as it were a
mixture of clay and sand, but in no wise inclined
to wet or springs of water.</p>
               <p>If you plant your trees twenty foote one way
and thirty foote the other,<note place="margin">Many men are at great charge<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

either plough broade ridges, or mow
your Orchard between euery ranke of trees: and
such plowing will also do good vnto the roots of
the trees, especially if you turne your ground vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
vnto the roots of your trees some three or
four plowings together, making your forrow in
the middest betweene euery ranke of trees, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
whereas the ground is inclined to wet.</p>
               <p>It is also requisite that the place where you
set your tree, be digged wide and deepe, to the
end that the rootes may haue loose earth to run
into: by which meanes the roote spreading and
increasing, it will send out the more nourishment
and strength into the top.</p>
               <p>Also when you plant your young trees in your
Orchard, it is requisite to cut off all the top, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
he will be in danger to die the next
Sommer, by reason the roote cannot the first
yeare be able to giue nourishment vnto many
boughes &amp; branches. Many couet to haue their
trees sixe or seuen foote high before they branch
out in top, but I haue found very great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience
in so doing, for that when such trees
come to beare fruite, the bodies will not be able
to sustaine the tops, but that they will bend
downe, and often times breake in sunder
with the weight of fruite: but to braunch
at some foure foote in height, I take to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18758:22"/>
be the best, especially where commeth no cattell
to crop them.</p>
               <p>In my opinion there were no fruite to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
vnto the Pippin, if it were not so subiect
vnto the canker as it is. There be manie kinds
of good apples, howbeit will not beare past once
in fiue or sixe yeares to anie purpose. Some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kinds will beare euerie second yeare excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
full. Of both which sorts I haue diuers
kinds, howbeit cannot giue proper names to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
of them. The good bearing fruite is fittest
for cider, so it be also naturally moist and not drie.
Howbeit the peare maketh the more delicate
drinke then the apple will do: and I haue seene
some perrie of that strength, that it will warme
the stomacke euen like white wine, and tast as
pleasantly. And I am verily perswaded, that a
ground planted with wild peares otherwise cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
choke peares, would be verie beneficiall vnto
the owner: for that such kind of fruite is fittest for
perrie, as also for the most part doth beare verie
full euerie yeare: and vntill your trees be of some
ten or twelue yeares growth, you may take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
by ploughing or mowing your ground,
and grasing the same with horses, and afterward
by mowing and grasing the same with any other
cattell, especially if you set your trees twentie
foote asunder one way, and thirtie foote another
way, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>The Peare will prosper in a ground inclined
to wet better then the apple will do.</p>
               <p>There is a disease in trees, which is called a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18758:22"/>
canker, wherevnto the pippin chiefly is greatly
subiect, and the same doth spoile manie trees. I
know no better remedie for the same, then to cut
it cleaue out in the winter time, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
doth helpe the same, so that the barke will
againe ouergrow the sore, and do well: but if it
haue once gone more then halfe about the tree, it
will hardly be euer recouered: and for the most
part the best and most delicate fruite is most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to this infirmitie. It may be here expected I
should treat of all kindes of grafting, as to graft
in the cleft, in the leafe, in the noch, or otherwise:
but surely for apples, peares, or most kind of
plummes, I haue found to graft in the clift some
foure inches aboue the ground to be the best.
Howbeit the Abricocke plumme, the vine, and
such other as haue great store of pith, they are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
to be grafted in the leafe, or eie (as the call it.)
The third way to graft in the noch, the cyent
must be in effect as great as the stocke, and such
grafts for the most part grow to be toppe heauie,
and therefore that kind of grafting to no great
purpose in my opinion.</p>
               <p>Some writers teach, that apples may be graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vpon the willow, the Elme, the Ash, Alder,
and such others: but a man had better be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
such fruite-trees in his Orchard then to haue
them, for that they will haue a tast of the stocke
that they are grafted on. An apple is not good to
be grafted, but vpon the stocke of the wild apple
or crab, as likewise the peare and warden vpon
the wild peare stocke.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:18758:23"/>
If you graft a Peare or a Warden vppon a
white thorne, it will be finall, hard, cappard, and
spotted.</p>
               <p>The Medler is good to be grafted vpon the
white thorne.</p>
               <p>The Quince is best to be planted of the wild
siences that grow out of the root of other Quince
trees, and so likewise the Philbard.</p>
               <p>The Chesnut and Walnut are to be set of
Nuts: and besides the commodity of the fruite,
do also become very good timber.</p>
               <p>The Chesnut timber will outlast the heart of
oke, to lie either alwayes wet or alwayes drie,
or sometime wet and sometime drie.</p>
               <p>The perry wil not last well aboue one yeare,
but the cider will last good two or
three yeares.</p>
